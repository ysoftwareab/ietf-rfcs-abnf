Abstract  
    
   This document describes the different types of Internet Service
   Provider (ISP) networks in existence today.  It will provide design
   and operational considerations in delivering network services to
   customers for five specific areas in an effort to better identify
   specific issues which may arise during a transition to IPv6.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

1. Introduction  
        
   This document will describe the basic design of ISP networks today.
   It will be used to provide direction on what must be considered to
   transition today's networks to IPv6.  The main purpose of this
   document is to identify, and document the issues that must be
   considered before transitioning a network to IPv6.

   This document is not meant to determine exactly how the transition
   will occur for the various ISP networks.  This document will not
   describe what is or is not a "Tier 1" or "Tier 2"..."Tier N" ISP.  
   The document focuses on IP capable network devices and may
   reference non-IP related devices for clarification purposes only.
        

   Comments to this draft may be sent to the primary author.

2. Scope of the document 
        
   The scope of this document is to cover the major topics ISPs must
   consider in building and running their IP networks.  The document
   will include sections on Core backbone networks, Broadband DSL 
   networks, Broadband HFC Cable networks, Narrowband Dialup networks,
   Infrastructure services, Public Wireless LAN Networks, Internet Exchange
   Points and Broadband Ethernet.  The document will also identify Security
   and Network Management concerns which in some cases will be common to 
   all as well some areas that may be unique to the particular service.

   Although the Optical core is important in today's networks, that
   layer is generally transparent to the IP layer except in a few
   special cases where ISPs have allowed the IP core to be aware of
   the optical layer underneath.  Hence, this draft does not include
   further optical considerations.

   Each scenario will discuss issues related to network topology, 
   network hardware, routing, policing, security, network management,
   configuration and host gear.


3. Transition Scenarios
        
   This section provides the description and design considerations
   for the different types of ISP networks in existence today.  In
   some cases a single ISP may provide services in more than one of
   the areas mentioned below.

3.1 Core/Backbone Networks 
        
   This section describes the general topologies of and characteristics
   of today's CORE networks.  Although there are numerous large scale
   networks out there today, most employ the same basic set of
   principles when designing and building their networks.

3.1.1 Topology

   In terms of physical equipment, today's backbone networks consist mainly of
   high-speed routers that are configured in a basic core and edge
   configuration.  In most configurations, for redundancy, there are two or more
   core routers as well as two or more border routers.  The border routers
   provide any local connectivity and peering.  Generally filtering, routing
   policy and policing type functions are done on the border routers.  The core
   routers provide aggregation of border router traffic as well as aggregation
   of long haul   circuits to remote sites.  The physical topology is depicted
   in Figure 3.1.1.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

   The logical topology includes the core routers being IBGP peers with every 
   other POP in the mesh.  The local border routers are route reflector clients
   of the core.

3.1.2. Hardware
   The hardware deployed in the CORE Backbone is similar across ISPs and
   generally consists of high-speed routers.  The requirement for switches in
   the CORE network is for infrastructure type hosting gear.  In some cases CPE
   equipment is provided by the CORE ISP.

3.1.3. Routing

3.1.3.1.....IGP
   Internally CORE ISPs generally use OSPF or ISIS as an IGP.  Loopback
   interfaces and point-to-point links are what make up routes within the IGP.
 
3.1.3.2.....EGP ( if applicable
   Generally BGP4 is the Edge gateway protocol of choice.  The EGP routing table
   consists of networks which are received via customer advertisements,
   statically configured for customers who are not running a dynamic routing
   protocol or networks that are nailed up as part of the ISP infrastructure.

3.1.3.3.....IRR & Routing Policy 
   Routing policy on the core includes multiple peer-groups setup to represent a
   collection of customers, external peers or internal peers.  In the case of
   customer connections, there are peer groups that are configured to send
   FULL_ROUTES, CUSTOMER-ROUTES or DEFAULT-ROUTES to a particular set of
   customers.  To perform this function, the peer groups reference ROUTE-MAPs. 
   External peers generally fit into the CUSTOMER_ROUTES peer group.  In the
   case of internal peers an INTERNAL peer group is used to identify internal
   routers that carry backbone circuits and an RRCLIENT peer-group is created to
   group border routers with a common set of characteristics.    

3.1.3.4.....Multicast
   Multicast is not widely deployed in CORE networks.  To implement multicast,
   providers have deployed parallel infrastructure using Unix hosts running
   mboned or dvmrp on separate routers.

3.1.3.5.....Addressing
   Addressing in the CORE of the network has two components. The infrastructure
   routers have requirements for loopback and point-to-point addresses.  These
   addresses are routed within the IGP.  Customer routes are pinned up on core
   routers.

3.1.3.6.....NAT
   NAT may be deployed in the CORE provider networks only in special cases.   

3.1.3.7.....Aggregation
   Aggregation of routes in the CORE networks should be done.  Networks that are
   used for loopbacks and interfaces should be aggregated prior to being
   advertised externally.  Generally aggregated "pin up" routes are placed on
   routers that carry backbone trunks.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

3.1.4. Traffic Engineering
   CORE providers have few choices in terms of traffic engineering.  One method
   is MPLS.  To use MPLS, a provider only needs a traffic matrix of next-hop
   data from within their network.  Once a provider knows how much traffic is
   sent between all routers in the network, MPLS tunnels can be built to steer
   traffic over the optimum path to deliver all traffic.  This scheme is
   analogous to the use of ATM PVCs over OC-12 circuits in prior years.  Most
   networks employ some type of traffic engineering mechanism to steer traffic
   around potentially congestive areas.  Beyond the standard methods of TE, some
   ISPs attempt to adjust metrics or cost on p2p links to perform TE.  An
   additional method involves using varying BGP routing announcements to
   increase or decrease traffic on a particular link.  Finally, there are also
   networks that employ an over provisioning model to limit packet loss.  This
   involves adding capacity above and beyond what is needed.

3.1.5. Security
   In the CORE provider's network, security has a specific scope.  Securing a
   network is typically done on the border or edge router.  Generally an attempt
   is made to filter BOGON(RFC 1918) routes, traffic sourced from unallocated
   address space or sourced from address ranges that are internal to the local
   ISP.  In some cases, hosts that support the infrastructure network equipment
   generally have filters in place to protect those hosts from outside attacks.

3.1.5.1.....Intrusion Detection
   Intrusion detection mechanisms and systems are used to protect infrastructure
   and host gear.  Generally these intrusion detection systems are placed at
   various points within the network to search for vulnerabilities within the
   infrastructure as well as monitor activity that may be considered suspicious.

3.1.5.2.....Ingress Filtering
   Ingress filtering on CORE networks comes in multiple flavors.  For providers
   that do filter, the first level is EGP filtering.  When a peering session is
   setup, ISPs require a peer to register their routes in an IRR and that data
   is used to create an EGP filter on the peering session to only accept
   registered advertised routes.  A step beyond this includes Reverse Path
   Forwarding (RPF) checks to verify that traffic sourced from the custom link
   is within the advertised range.

3.1.6. Network Management
   Devices within the network must be monitored.  This is done over in-band
   connections to the network devices.  Generally there are filters on the
   routers to allow SNMP queries from the query server.

3.1.6.1.....Out of band
   Out of band networks allow access to consoles of the network gear.  In some
   cases this access is done in-band.  There are also cases where separate
   networks are built to allow access.

3.1.6.2.....Configuration Tools
   Many ISPs have monitoring tools that query the network gear to gather data.
   These scripts are written in perl or expect and will access the device via
   the CLI over the in-band ipv4 connection.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          
 
3.1.6.3.....SNMP
   Statistical monitoring of network gear is done via SNMP queries.  These
   queries are done via the in-band connection.

3.1.7. Hosting Gear

   In terms of host gear, the CORE networks maintain hosts for supporting and
   managing the network, but not necessarily the end user.  The standard set of
   hosts include DNS servers, mail gateways, authentication( radius or tacacs),
   and network management servers.  The servers are distributed to strategic
   locations for diversity purposes.  Servers included in this model include DNS
   and TACACS servers that directly support the operator's network. 
   Reachability to the servers is over an IPv4 routed connection.  Cacheing
   infrastructure is deployed in CORE provider networks in a very limited
   fashion to assist in reducing the traffic pulled from external sources.

3.2 Broadband HFC/Coax Networks 
        
   This section describes the infrastructure that exists in today's HFC
   cable networks that support cable modem services to the home.  Since
   many cable providers are regional they generally have used the
   backbone ISP networks for transit IP services beyond their region.


3.2.1 Terminology

   HFC network: Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network

   CM: Cable Modem

   CMTS: Cable Modem Termination System

   CPE: Customer Premises Equipment

   DOCSIS: Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification -- the
      standards defining how data should be carried on HFC networks


3.2.2 Topology

3.2.2.1 Physical

   HFC networks are a mix of fiber optic and coaxial cables originally
   designed for the delivery of cable television.  A single
   infrastructure can support video distribution, data networking and
   telephony.  Video and data signals are typically sourced from
   different systems and frequency division multiplexed over the HFC
   network.  Historically HFC networks were uni-directional and required
   some kind of telco-return path to support bi-directional data.  Today
   much of the cable infrastructure has been upgraded to support return
   paths over the HFC network.

   A CMTS can serve quite a large geographic area: 10s of miles radius
   is not uncommon and DOCSIS specifies a 100 mile diameter upper limit.

   In a DOCSIS system, down-stream and up-stream channels are distinct
   and occupy different frequency bands.  A CMTS may terminate multiple
   up and downstream channels and a CM must tune in to an up-stream and
   down-stream channels before communicating.  All packets on the HFC
   network are forwarded via the CMTS.  Cable modems may forward packets
   between network segments attached to CPE.  Hundreds of hosts on a
   cable network may be part of the same broadcast domain.

3.2.2.2 Logical

   DOCSIS systems are designed to transport IP traffic.  The following
   two paragraphs are present in all current DOCSIS specifications.

   Section 1.3.1 [DOCSIS-1.1]:

       "The intended service will allow transparent bi-directional
       transfer of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, between the cable
       system headed and customer locations, over an all-coaxial or
       hybrid-fiber/coax(HFC) cable network."

   Section 3.2.2.1 [DOCSIS-1.1]:

       "Forwarding of IP traffic MUST be supported. Other network layer
       protocols MAY be supported. The ability to restrict the network
       layer to a single protocol such as IP MUST be supported."

   In the context of the [DOCSIS-1.0], [DOCSIS-1.1] and [DOCSIS-2.0]
   specifications "Internet Protocol (IP) traffic" means IPv4 traffic.

   The following diagram(Figure 3.2.1) has been reproduced from the DOCSIS RFI
   specification [DOCSIS-1.1] and slightly simplified:

                    +-----------+

   Note that between the WAN and the CPE, both forwarding at Layer-2
   (bridging) and at Layer-3 (routing) will meet the goal of transparent
   transport of IP traffic.

3.2.3. Hardware

3.2.3.1 Cable Modems

   Cable modems operate as transparent L2 bridges forwarding datagrams
   from the HFC network to the CPE network.




Mickles, et al.        Expires - April 2003                      [Page 12]   



                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

   Cable modems use a combination of policy settings and IGMPv2[RFC2236]
   to control multicast forwarding (see Section 3.3.1 [DOCSIS-1.1]).
   Forwarding of IPv6 multicast datagrams may not occur properly as CMs
   are required to forward multicast datagrams only when CPE equipment
   has joined that group.  This is potentially a show-stopper if native
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery[RFC2461] is being used through a CM.

3.2.3.2 CMTS Layer-2 Bridge

   A DOCSIS compliant CMTS MAY be implemented as a Layer-2 transparent
   bridge.  Forwarding of IPv4 packets by the transparent bridge is
   mandatory and forwarding of other protocols MAY be supported.  It is
   likely that implementers using this approach will support forwarding
   of arbitrary protocols using 802.1d hence forwarding of native IPv6
   datagrams should just work.  IPv6 is then deployed on the ISP router
   infrastructure natively or using an automatic tunneling scheme like
   6to4[RFC3056].

   As with the CM, a bridged CMTS that selectively forwards multicast
   datagrams on the basis of IGMPv2 will potentially break IPv6 ND.
   This behavior is recommended but not mandated for a Layer-2 CMTS.

   Communication between CPE behind different cable modems is always
   forwarded by the CMTS.  IPv6 communication between the different
   sites relies on multicast IPv6 Neighbor Discovery[RFC2461] frames
   being forwarded correctly by the CM and the CMTS.

3.2.3.3 CMTS IP Router

   A DOCSIS compliant CMTS MAY be implemented as a Layer-3 IPv4 router.
   In this case IPv6 packets passing from the WAN network to CPE must be
   encapsulated in IPv4.  Forwarding between channels on the HFC network
   (i.e.  within a CMTS) may still take place at L2 hence the comments
   in Section 3.2 may also apply.

   A CMTS MAY also be an IPv6 router and thus support IPv6 natively.

3.2.3.4 IPv4 NAT CPE routers

   A fairly common CPE device in HFC networks is the IPv4 NAT/DHCP
   router.  It is usually connected between the cable modem and all
   other CPE equipment allows multiple devices to share a single IPv4
   address and cable modem connection with a minimum of configuration
   overhead.  The NAT/DHCP router is a directional IPv4-only device in
   the communication path between the CMTS and the CPE.

   Unfortunately the IPv4 NAT router prevents (or at least seriously
   complicates) the deployment of IPv6 in a number of ways:

   o  As an IPv4-only device it will block native IPv6 frames forwarded
      through the cable modem.

Mickles, et al.        Expires - April 2003                      [Page 13]   


                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

   o  The use of private addresses on the CPE network means that schemes
      relying on global IPv4 addresses (e.g.  6to4[RFC3056]) cannot be
      used.

   o  Many NAT/DHCP routers only support forwarding of a limited number
      of IPv4 protocols (e.g.  TCP, UDP, ICMP) and will drop IPv4
      encapsulated IPv6 with an "unknown" protocol number (e.g.  6to4
      packets).

   In an ideal world every IPv4 NAT router would be upgraded to
   additionally become a native IPv6 router using 6to4 automatic
   tunneling.

   In general 6to4 residential gateway devices must be made as self-
   configuring as existing IPv4 NAT routers.

3.2.4. HFC IPv6 Deployment Options

3.2.4.1 IPv6 Tunneled over IPv4

   IPv6 may be deployed on existing IPv4-only HFC infrastructure using
   6to4[RFC3056] on the cable modem or CPE residential gateway device.
   The cable modem or residential gateway becomes an IPv6 router (much
   as IPv4 NAT devices become IPv4 routers for the CPE network).

   This approach has the following features:

   o  Requires a global IPv4 address for each cable modem.

   o  Is to a large extent self-configuring.

   o  A 6to4 relay router is required for connectivity to the native
      IPv6 internet.  This may be achieved via the ISP sinking traffic
      to the IPv4 6to4 relay router anycast address[RFC3068], or via
      some yet to be specified mechanism.

   o  Software upgrade of cable modems is required (or addition of a
      separate box with 6to4 functionality.  CMTS upgrade is not
      required.

   Tunnel broker[RFC3053] software may also be used in the cable modem
   or residential gateway and allows the use of non-6to4 IPv6 address
   space.  The trusted status of the cable modem on the HFC network may
   be leveraged to make the authentication of tunnel setup requests
   transparent to the subscriber.

3.2.4.2 Native IPv6 through HFC system

   IPv6 may be deployed natively on HFC networks by connecting a L2-
   bridging CMTS to an IPv6 router or by adding IPv6 router
   functionality to the CMTS.  IPv6 packets are forwarded at Layer-2
   through a transparent cable modem to CPE equipment.  IPv6 capable CPE

Mickles, et al.        Expires - April 2003                      [Page 14]   


                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          


   uses Stateless Auto-configuration[RFC2462] to configure address and
   routing information.  Potential show-stoppers are present with
   multicast forwarding in the cable modem and in a bridged CMTS (see
   Section 3.1 and Section 3.2).

   This approach has the following features:

   o  Supports IPv6-only deployments, or deployments where global IPv4
      addresses are not readily available.

   o  The ISP router or CMTS can operate with native IPv6 backhaul or
      using tunneling.  Centralising tunneling functionality in the CMTS
      or head end router allows a single global IPv4 address can be used
      to support a large number of global IPv6 addresses for CPE
      devices.

   o  Cable modems just bridge Layer-2 traffic from IPv6 capable CPE to
      the HFC network.


3.2.5 Routing

   There are no known HFC-specific routing issues.

   Cable networks are typically access networks.  If the CMTS is a
   native IPv6 router then it will likely need to participate in ISPs
   the IGP of choice.  If the CMTS is a bridge, the infrastructure
   router(s) that it connects to will need to speak an IGP.

   If 6to4[RFC3056] is used, it is recommended that the ISP sink (and
   forward) traffic to the anycast 6to4 relay router address[RFC3068].

3.2.6 Policing

   Cable networks are large shared subnets.  Filtering is extensively
   used in this environment to ensure stability of the network and to
   protect subscribers.  For example, filters are used to prevent CPE
   DHCP server responses from escaping from the CPE network.  As a
   security measure, filters are very often deployed to prevent file
   sharing protocols leaking between different CPE sites.

   IPv6 opens up a new communication channel.  Existing IPv4 filter
   software will not block IPv6 communication.  If IPv6 is tunneled over
   an IPv4 infrastructure filters may need to examine the contents of
   encapsulated packets.

3.2.7 Security

   CPE NAT boxes are rectifying routers.  This can be viewed as an
   implementation of an "outgoing only" security policy.  IPv6 devices
   need to be able to support a similar kind of policy.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

3.2.8 Network Management

   DOCSIS cable modems use an out of band, privately addressed IPv4
   network for configuration and network management functions.  DOCSIS
   cable modems and CMTS are IPv4 hosts on the out of band management
   network.  At present there is no compelling need to update this
   network to support IPv6.

   DOCSIS cable modems use:

      SNMP [RFC1157] for network management.

      TFTP [RFC1350] for software and configuration parameter download

      DHCP [RFC2131] for acquiring IPv4 address, etc allowing
      communication on the management network.

      ToD [RFC0868] for initial time synchronisation.

   Various MIBs for RF and CPE filter configuration..  DOCSIS OSSI docs
   override the IETF MIB specifications.  Any IPv6 issues in there?

3.2.9 Host Gear

   Dual stack DNS server is necessary if you want to support IPv6-only
   CPE equipment.

   DDNS is pretty much mandatory if you want to give CPE devices DNS
   names.  This is because only the IPv6 host knows what its full IPv6
   address is (esp when privacy addresses are used).

   Transition functionality..  which?  where?

   v4/v6 translation between devices in the home is done where? If
   RFC1918 addresses are in use (perhaps behind the NAT), then there
   isn't much choice but to do it inside the CPE box.

   Transparent proxy caches aren't going to cache IPv6 web traffic.

3.3 Broadband DSL Networks 
        
   This section describes the infrastructure that exists in todays
   High Speed DSL Networks. 
   
3.3.1 DSL physical architecture 

   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology is a modem technology that 
   allows subscribers to perform access from the home or office to 
   broadband network services by using existing twisted-pair copper wire
   telephone lines.
   The term xDSL is the generic name that has been given to the family of 
   digital subscriber line technologies, including ADSL, SDSL, HDSL, VDSL,
   and IDSL.
   The POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) takes only the frequency range 
   0-3000 Hz but there is considerably more bandwidth on these copper 
   lines; DSL gets more from them by using sophisticated digital coding 
   and splitting the line (reserving the higher frequencies for data, 
   the lower for voice and fax) to achieve high-speed data transmission
   over the local loop from the customer site to a service provider's 
   switching center. But the bandwidth a subscriber can receive depends on
   the quality of the line and on the distance to the service provider's 
   center.

   Distance can be increased, but then speed is reduced. For instance, it
   is possible to use ADSL up to 18,000 feet, but the maximum downstream 
   speed is then reduced to 1544 kbps.

   Several models are used to deploy IP over DSL services, but all use the
   same components:

   The hosts are connected to the DSL network either directly through a
   modem, either through a router and a modem. The modems may be included 
   in the hosts or in the routers. When it is not the case, the DSL modems
   may be accessed through ATM, Ethernet or USB. 

   It must be noted that when a router is used in customer premises, it
   often has only very limited resources in terms of memory or processing
   power.

   IP packets are then transported on twisted-pair telephone lines to the 
   NAP's DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexer), thanks to DSL technology. The 
   DSLAM terminates and multiplexes several DSL accesses to the NAP's 
   backbone. It forwards data to the BAS (Broadband Access Server = DSLAM 
   aggregator), which is in charge of directing them to the POP (Point Of 
   Presence = the ISP Edge Router) of the NSP that the client has 
   subscribed to. Note that NAP and NSP can be the same organization. The
   technology used in the NAP network is usually ATM, but other types of
   layer 2 technologies may be used.

   This model enables the local operator to make its local copper 
   available to other companies. Operators are then able to offer DSL 
   technology for broadband Internet access.

   As the access network puts service users in communication with their
   NSPs, security and access control are required.

3.3.2 Logical architectures used today for IPv4 access

   Data transport between the CPE and the service provider's point of 
   presence (POP) generally relies on an ATM based infrastructure. Two 
   types of use of this infrastructure are common:

* ATM point-to-point model: one PVC connects each subscriber to its 
  NSP. From the Broadband Access Server (BAS), there are exactly as many
  PVCs across the NAP network as the number of subscribers (i.e. one PVC
  per subscriber). 
  This model is detailed in section 3.3.2.1.
  
* Aggregation model: the BAS aggregates multiple subscriber PVCs into 
  trunk PVCs to reduce the number of PVC connections across the NAP core
  network (one PVC provisioned for many subscribers to the same 
  destination NSP, or if the NSP offers multiple service levels, more 
  than one PVC could be established across the core). There are two 
  usual ways to aggregate connections:
     - PPP Terminated Aggregation (PTA): PPP sessions are opened between
       each subscriber and the BAS. The BAS terminates PPP sessions and 
       transfers subscriber's traffic up to the POP. 
       This model is detailed in section 3.3.2.2.
     - L2TP Access Aggregation (LAA): PPP sessions are opened between 
       each subscriber and the POP. The BAS dispatches PPP sessions up 
       to the POP, by encapsulating them into L2TP tunnels. 
       This model is detailed in section 3.3.2.3.


3.3.2.1 ATM POINT-TO-POINT MODEL

   This model is adapted to networks with few subscribers and static 
   configuration. It is simple to deploy but it cannot be used in large 
   networks.

   In this model, each subscriber is connected to its NSP via one PVC.
   The user network IP packets are transmitted frames from the CPE to the 
   DSL modem or router. There, RFC 2684 bridging occurs: The LAN frames are
   forwarded into an ATM PVC (segmenting them into ATM cells through AAL5).

   U and V are WAN technologies (SONET/SDH...)

   Since the CPE is in bridging mode, this model is layer 3-independent 
   and the NAP is free of addressing and routing concerns. 

   The NSP edge router sees all subscribers as attached to the same 
   Ethernet link. Very complex controls and restrictions must thus be 
   performed to avoid spoofing and broadcast storms. 

   Last, subscribers do not have access to multiple ISPs over a single 
   DSL line.

3.3.2.2 PPP TERMINATED AGGREGATION (PTA) MODEL  

   The PTA architecture relies on PPP-based technologies (PPPoA and PPPoE),
   terminated at the BAS. The BAS has at least one PVC opened to each NSP,
   but several PVCs are sometimes used when the NSP offers differentiated 
   services (QoS...).

   In this architecture, the aggregator BAS provides PPP session 
   termination and the subscriber data is then forwarded to the NSP's edge
   router using IP over ATM.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          


   Since the PPP session is terminated at the BAS, the BAS must perform 
   per session authentication, authorization and accounting on behalf of 
   the NSP, and perform layer 3 routing. 

   The PTA architecture has several advantages. First, it reduces the 
   number of PVCs used in the NAP core network. Second, it offers the 
   subscribers the capability to choose between several NSPs. However, it
   is not as flexible as the LAA model from this point of view: it requires
   strong coordination between the NSP and the NAP. This model is often
   used when the NSP is also the NAP.

   The PPP sessions initiated by the CPEs are terminated at the 
   aggregation device (BAS), which authenticates users either by using a 
   local database or by sending a request to a remote server located at 
   the NSP (a RADIUS server for instance). When RADIUS is used, a user can
   be authenticated based on a username or based on the VPI/VCI used. There
   is only one PPP session per ATM PVC.

   Upon successful authentication, the customer premises equipment may 
   then be configured dynamically. Of course, static configuration is also
   possible. When dynamic configuration is used, the BAS obtains the 
   address of a DNS server and an IPv4 address or prefix for the customer,
   usually through a DHCP server or a RADIUS server. The BAS then sends 
   this information to the CPE via IPCP, and establishes a new route 
   between the CPE and the BAS.

   The PPPoE-based PTA model is more flexible than the PPPoA based one: 
   several PPP sessions may be opened with the BAS at the same time, over 
   as many PPPoE sessions. This allows subscriber to access several 
   services at the same time, on the same VC.

   The authentication process is the same as the PPPoA one except that 
   VPI/VCI-based authentication cannot be used.  

   It must be noted that the extra PPPoE encapsulation reduces the IP MTU 
   and MRU, because two PPP and PPPoE headers (2+6 bytes) are inserted 
   between the IP packet and the Ethernet header. This also results in a 
   decrease of the MSS of TCP that applications should use.  

3.3.2.3 L2TP ACCESS AGGREGATION (LAA) MODEL

   While PTA model terminates PPP sessions at the aggregation device and 
   then forwards IP traffic to its destination, LAA model allows forwarding
   PPP sessions from subscribers to the NSP's point of presence, via a L2TP
   tunnel.

   When a CPE initiates a session with its NSP, the BAS intercepts the PPP
   connection request. It reads the PPP identities of the subscriber and of
   the NSP, and sends a request to the NSP's RADIUS server, asking for the
   address of the device to which the PPP connection should be forwarded. 

   If not opened yet, a L2TP tunnel is established between the BAS and the
   NSP's server. The PPP connection is then encapsulated and forwarded 
   into this tunnel.
   User authentication and dynamic configuration are performed by the NSP
   itself.

3.3.2.4 OPTIMAL MTU CONFIGURATION FOR  DSL CONNECTIONS USING PPPOE

   While PPPoA does not impact the default MTU on an LAN environment (1500 
   bytes), PPPoE induces a smaller MTU (1492 bytes, 1500 bytes minus 2 
   bytes for PPP header and 6 bytes for PPPoE header).

   This causes some problems, especially when ICMP error messages such as 
   "Packet Too Big' are filtered by intermediate nodes.

3.3.3 ADDRESSING FOR TODAY'S IPv4 ACCESS

   One of the benefits of DSL for the customer is the capability to enjoy 
   a permanent connection to the Internet on the telephone line. This 
   allows the customers to use peer-to-peer applications and to set up 
   servers when they are given stable global IP addresses.

   However, some service providers do not supply static addresses by 
   default, and a lot of customers are using dynamic addresses today. 
   Customers are usually disconnected every day and are given a new 
   address each time they reconnect.

   Most of the times, customers use private addressing on their LAN and the
   access routers then perform NAT for Internet access.

   Some small ISPs do not even provide global addresses to their customers.
   These ISPs then operates NATs on their backbones.

3.3.4 ROUTING

   Customers of DSL services may run routing protocols on their LAN 
   (usually RIP or OSPF), but these LANs are usually small and do not 
   require the use of a routing protocol.

   When a router is used in the customer premises, it is usually configured
   with a default route to the NSP's edge router. In case of multi-homing,
   the customer's router may use BGP.

   The NAP may have to run an IGP (OSPF or IS-IS).

   Usually, the NSP uses an IGP (OSPF or IS-IS) on its core network. 


3.3.5 DNS

   Very often, the domain name of the customer is managed by the NSP and
   the domain name server is also hosted by the NSP. 
   In fewer cases, the customer hosts the server on its own LAN.

3.3.6 Network management

   Usually, NSPs manage the edge routers by SNMP. The management stations
   are located on the core network.

   Very few service providers manage equipment located on customers LANs. 
   The use of NAT on the customer edge router forbids this type of service.

3.4 Narrowband Dialup Networks 
        
   This section describes Narrowband dialup networks that the majority
   of internet users use today to get online.  The scenarios will
   include solutions where the dial infrastructure is controlled by
   one entity as well as solutions where ISPs lease modems from a
   wholesale modem providers.

   There are multiple types of dialup services from plain/no frills
   access to the Internet, to wholesale dialup networks that can
   purchased by an organization wanting to resell internet services,
   and then there are the full service dialup providers that provide
   a long list of features to the end user.

   Generally smaller dialup ISPs purchase a T1 or greater facility from
   a Local Exchange Carrier(LEC) to the facility where modem equipment
   is housed.  The choice in terms of the number of T1s (or other) is
   made dependent on how many simultaneous users are supported in the
   ISP's business model.  Depending on the coverage area multiple phone
   numbers may be provided for the end-user to dial and the LEC may
   choose to route all calls to a common termination point or provide
   the traffic across multiple T1 facilities.  When an end-user dials
   an access number, the LEC routes the call to the modem server
   location and is generally mapped by the LEC into a T1 facility that
   terminates on the modem server.  The modem server attempts to
   verify the user credentials by querying the authentication server
   via an IP interface on the modem server.  The modem server is
   present on a LAN network segment along with any relevant hosts as
   well as the default gateway router.  Some services that are common
   to all dialup providers include the ability to provide DNS service
   either primary or secondary and an authentication server. 

   The wholesale dial provider builds out the dial network just as the
   small dialup provider does.  Differences include the ability of the
   wholesale provider to hand off aggregated traffic to the
   organization purchasing wholesale access or to allow the aggregated
   traffic to reach the Internet at large without the purchasing
   organization needing major internet access facilities.  Each case
   has different implications.  


   The infrastructure used in the foundation of these various offerings
   is somewhat similar although the deployments vary depending on the
   level of service offered.  The basic dialup service provider model
   that includes modem access to the Internet can be built from a
   terminal server (generally a digital modem bank), a Layer 2 switch
   and routers.  For global reachability the dialup provider must
   connect to a backbone provider.  The basic design calls for the
   terminal server to be attached to a layer 2 switch that would in
   turn have connections to a router.  For redundancy, a dialup

   provider can spread multiple shelves of terminal servers across
   individual routers and manually shift traffic if a router becomes
   disabled.  A more robust redundant solution would be to deploy
   pairs of routers and use some Router Redundancy Protocol functionality to
   maintain traffic in the event of a failure of one router.

3.4.2. Hardware
The hardware involved in dialup service provider connections include the CPE device that is usually a 56K modem, the Terminal server/modem bank and an authentication server.  
 

3.4.3. Routing

>From the host device the user connects to the terminal server using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).  Once the PPP connection is made the user credentials are sent to the Authentication server.  The user is then assigned an IP address and then the connection is forwarded to the appropriate Internet Service Provider (ISP) and then on to a Network Service Provider (NSP).  The NSP and ISP network can be external or internal to the dialup service provider.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          


In some cases Dialup service providers will use Network Address Translation (NAT) to connect to external networks.  NAT is only required if the address assigned by the authentication server is not a public address.

Routing protocols such as an IGP or EGP will only come into play between the ISP and NSP networks. The address space required at a point of presence (POP) is determined by summing the number of modem ports available at a POP.  IRR routing policy is generally registered by the ISP or NSP but in some cases the dialup provider may register policy.


3.4.4. Traffic Engineering

Traffic Engineering (TE) at the dialup ISP level is closer to connection load balancing.  TE is generally done by the authentication servers, which monitor the number of active connections and balance connections across available ISP routed connections.

3.4.5. Security

Security in the dialup ISP model is mainly meant to protect the network gear from intrusion.  By default the terminal servers prevent connections between users.

3.4.6. Network Management

3.4.7. Hosting Gear
There are a number of hosts that support the dialup ISP model.  All servers do not necessarily reside at the terminal server point of connection.  Servers included in this model include DNS, Radius, and Mail servers that directly support the end user but are deployed in an optimum location.  Reachability to the servers is over an IPv4 routed connection.  Servers indirectly related to supporting the user include TACACS servers used to authenticate access to network equipment, tool servers to query and monitor, and cache servers that assist in handling web requests.  Cache servers are typically used transparently in between the user and the Internet.

3.6. Public Wireless LAN

This section describes the infrastructure that exists in today's public wireless 
LAN services.
    
3.6.1 Topology

3.6.1.1 Physical architecture of public wireless LAN

Public wireless LAN (WLAN) enables subscribers within home, office or the outdoors to perform Internet access by using WLAN technology. WLAN technology is standardized by IEEE 802.11, and its maximum transmission speed varies from 1 or 2 Mbps (IEEE 802.11) and 11 Mbps (IEEE 802.11b) to 54 Mbps (IEEE 802.11a).

Figure 3.6.1 describes the physical architecture of wireless LAN model.

           Figure 3.6.1. Physical architecture of WLAN model.

Hosts can connect to WLAN by using WLAN network interface card (NIC), by using PCI or PCMCIA slot. WLAN is basically a broadcast network, and several hosts can share the network by using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access mechanism. Legacy WLAN does not consider authentication and security, but allow any subscriber to connect the network at any time.  However, in order for WLAN to be used as public access network, such authentication and security mechanisms are required.
Access point (AP) acts as an authentication client, and sends host's authentication parameter to authentication server. Such mechanisms are presented in 3.x.5 in detail.  Once the host is authenticated, AP acts as a bridge in order to relay host's information to ISP or vice versa. Various access network technologies can be used between AP and ISP.  Lease line, xDSL and HFC/cable are few examples.

3.6.2 Routing and Addressing

Public wireless LANs are usually configured in small area (aka, hot spots) and 
basically broadcast networks. Thus, they do not require the use of a routing protocol.
    
One of benefits of public WLAN is to provide for customers convenient Internet access.  This allows the customers in the outdoors to connect to public access networks.  ISPs supply not static addresses by default but dynamic addresses by DHCP.  The customers are usually disconnected every time and are given a new address each time they reconnect.  Most of the times, customers use private addressing and the access routers then perform NAT for Internet access.

3.6.3 Traffic Engineering 

ISPs may need to configure traffic filtering or provisioning on demand of 
their customers.

3.6.4 Security 

Like ethernet, IEEE 802.11 standard dose not define authentication and security 
mechanisms. Moreover, WLAN is basically a broadcast network and each host can listen information of another host within the same AP service area. Therefore, in order for ISPs to use WLAN as public access network, they should provide authentication and data privacy mechanisms. Authentication mechanism is used to identify whether a subscriber is registered to access the Internet. There can be
two authentication mechanisms: (1) IEEE 802.1x and (2) non-standard MAC address
based authentication. Once a subscriber is considered as valid, information
exchanged between AP and the subscriber should be encrypted in order not to be
understood by others. IEEE 802.11i is being standardized on new form of
robust security network (RSN) architecture.

3.6.4.1 IEEE 802.1x based authentication

IEEE 802.1x enables edge devices such as bridge or AP to perform authentication
mechanism, and determines whether to allow or block data transmitted by hosts.
It uses extended authentication protocol (EAP) as a standard protocol to transmit
subscriber's authentication data. Authentication is based of userID and/or password,
and packets transmitted by un-authenticated hosts are filtered and dropped by AP
Figure 3.6.3 describes logical architecture of 802.1x based authentication

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Nov. 2002          

The operation of IEEE 802.11 is as follows. Host trying to access the Internet sends EAP-start message to AP. Then AP requests to host subscriber ID information necessary for user authentication. In this case, subscriber ID follows network access ID (NAI) similar to e-mail address format, in order to support global roaming and accounting.  Subscriber ID is inserted in AAA EAP-attribute message and transmitted to authentication server (such as Radius or TACACS server). Finally, authentication procedure is completed when AP receives authentication success/failure message from authentication server.

3.6.4.2 MAC address based authentication (non-standard)

This mechanism supports host that does not support IEEE 802.1x. In this mechanism, AP inserts MAC address of hosts into username field and sends authentication message to authentication server. The server determines authentication based on MAC address of host. This mechanism can be considered as unsafe method because subscriber can lose the WLAN card and MAC address can be changed.

3.6.4.3 Data privacy

WLAN is basically broadcast network. Therefore, every host within service area of an AP can listen another host's communication contents. Therefore, very complicated data privacy mechanism must be provided in order not to be revealed by other hosts except intended host. One method to accomplish privacy is to use extension of IEEE 802.1x.  Once the subscriber is successfully authenticated, master session key generated during authentication procedure is inserted in authentication success message and transmitted to AP. Then, AP exchanges the key with end host by using EAPoL-key message and synchronizes when to use the key. And then, AP encrypts EAP-success message with the key and sends it to the host in order to notify that the host is allowed to connect WLAN by using IEEE 802.1x. After that, host and AP use dynamically distributed key in order to guarantee privacy within wireless area.

3.6.4.4 Intrusion Detection, Ingress Filtering, and Prevention

Moreover, intrusion detection, ingress filtering and prevention should be considered.

3.6.5 Network Management 

ISPs manage the edge routers by SNMP. As well, ISPs need the management of AP by means of its configuration tools. 

3.6.6 Hosting Gear 

The mail, dns, caching, etc. servers for the customer is usually managed by the ISPs.
