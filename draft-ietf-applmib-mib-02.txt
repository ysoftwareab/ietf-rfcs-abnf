Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet Community.  In particular, it defines objects used for
   the management of applications.  This MIB complements the System
   Application MIB, providing for the management of applications' common
   aspects which could not typically be observed without the cooperation
   of the software being managed.


1. Introduction

   This draft furthers the work begun in the systems application mib
   [11].  See the issues list at the end of this document for issues
   that remain to be worked out.

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB          21 March 1997


   The development of [1], [2], [3], [4], [8] and [9] provides us with a
   base of experience in making a variety of applications visible to
   management; this specification abstracts out the common aspects of
   applications management and provides a generic base usable for the
   management of almost any application.

2. Overview

   Many important topics were not handled in system application MIB
   [11].  The following topics are within the scope of the this
   document:


        -    Support for generic application throughput measurements;

        -    Providing MIB definitions that allow managed entities to
             report what they considered to be units of work;

        -    Providing support for generic application response time
             monitoring capabilities;

        -    Provide explicit support for the management of applications
             distributed within a single managed system ("local"
             distribution);

        -    Address generic resource management issues, including:

             -    files in use;

             -    I/O statistics (from the application's perspective,
                  not at the operating system or device driver level);

             -    other resources are open to discussion, possibilities
                  include:

                  -    various system calls;

                  -    heap usage;

                  -    stack penetration;

                  -    networking resources.

             -    Providing access to dependency information, both in
                  the form of MIB objects to report dependencies on
                  "mission critical" processes, as well as the logging
                  of failures due to dependencies.

        -    Provide a generic logging (stderr) capability:

             -    Identify common application log entries interest;

             -    Permit use of specialized log entries where
                  appropriate;

             -    Provide generic facility for the management of this
                  log;

             -    Provide generic facility to control notification
                  generation by the application;

        -    Facilities for the control of applications, including:

             -    Starting and stopping applications and their elements;

             -    Suspending and resuming applications and their
                  elements;

             -    Configuration of application parameters;

             -    A "mission critical process" MIB to identify processes
                  that are of particular interest;

             -    Reconfiguration (e.g., SIGHUP) request capability.

   Note that these issues are addressed at least in part by other
   standards work, including [12] and [13].

   Some topics were identified as being of interest to the applmib
   working group, but outside the scope of this document.

     -    Providing MIB definitions that allow management to define what
          is to be considered an error.  This includes mechanisms for
          filtering and selective forwarding of information from
          notifications or log entries.

   Topics identified as specifically out of scope include:


     -    Providing MIB definitions to allow dynamic control of the
          definition of units of work;

     -    Explicit support for the management of applications
          distributed across multiple systems; (The indexing structure
          and semantics of the system application MIB [11] are not
          sufficient for this task.)

     -    Issues of backup and recovery;

     -    Issues of software request, delivery, installation,
          activation, patching, version update, reversion, and removal;

     -    Issues of software validation and integrity checks;

     -    Issues of software licensing.

3. Architecture

     To emulate the object-oriented modeling techniques of subclassing
     and multiple inheritance, the SNMP information model provides for
     the use of tables with common indexes.  The challenge for the
     developer of management applications is to recognize those
     situations in which various aspects of a single logical resource
     are represented in several different tables, possibly defined in
     different MIBs.

     Most of the management information defined here may pertain to any
     number of applications in a managed system.  The simplest way of
     supporting this requirement within the SNMP information model is to
     use tables.  This means that the management information for a
     particular resource may be found in one or more rows of one or more
     tables; the fact that this information pertains to a single
     resource may be deduced from the index values used, possibly with
     the support of mapping tables.  This also means that a single table
     may contain management information relevant to a number of
     applications.  This has significant implementation implications;
     see the implementation issues section below for more information.

     Relationships to other MIBs

     This section will outline the relationships of the components of
     this MIB (usually in the form of common indexing structures) to:

     -    the systems applications MIB [11]

     -    the host resources MIB [1]

     -    the entity MIB [8]

     -    the network services monitoring MIB [2]

   Relationship to NSM

   The Network Services Monitoring MIB is defined as the base set of
   attributes for managing network applications.  This MIB extends that



Applmib Working Group    Expires September 1997                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft         Application Management MIB          21 March 1997


   set of attributes to include information normally obtainable only
   from the managed resource itself, rather than the supporting system.

   The nsmToSysApplElmtRunTable is defined to provide the relationship
   between the NSM and system application MIB frameworks.

   Relationship to the system application MIB

   The system application MIB defines attributes for management of
   applications which can be realized without instrumenting an
   application.  This specification extends that framework to include
   additional attributes which will typically require instrumentation
   within the managed resource.  The sysApplRunElmtIndex is the key
   connection between these two MIBs; it is essential that
   implementations of this MIB and of the system applications MIB
   running concurrently on a given platform employ a consistent policy
   for assigning this value to running application elements.

4. MIB Structure

   The open files table

   The open files table contains one entry for file in use by a
   manageable running application element.  The purpose of this table is
   to identify the files in use and to record I/O activity on each file
   attributable to a particular running application element.

   If multiple running application elements open the same file, there
   will be an entry for each running application element opening that
   file.  Similarly, if a running application element opens a file
   multiple times, there will be an entry in this table for the file
   corresponding to each open.

   The task of combining the information for file activity from this
   table (organized by running application element) into per-application
   statistics can be accomplished by a manager using the System
   Application MIB's [11] sysApplInstallPkgTable to find the installed
   application, the sysApplRunTable to find the running instances of
   that application, and the sysApplElmtRunTable to find the relevant
   values of sysApplElmtRunIndex.  The manager, armed with a set of
   values for sysApplElmtRunIndex, is now able to retrieve the relevant
   portions of the applOpenFileTable and other tables in this MIB.

   Entries in this table are indexed by the application run index and an
   arbitrary integer, chosen so that taken together the application run
   index and this integer yield a unique key for each open file.  The
   following information is available in this table:

     -    file name

     -    number of read requests

     -    number of bytes read

     -    timestamp of last read operation

     -    number of write requests

     -    number of bytes written

     -    timestamp of last write operation

     -    number of seek operations

     -    file size

     -    permissions with which file was opened

   Special cases to consider: stdin, stdout, stderr, etc. may require
   some special handling.

   The open files cross-reference table

   This table provides a way to efficiently determine which processes
   are currently holding a file open.  It introduces no new attributes
   of its own, and merely provides an alternative indexing to the open
   file table.

   The open connections table

   This table extends the capabilities provided by the network services
   monitoring MIB [2].  It includes:

     -    time the connection was opened

     -    identification of the transport protocol in use

     -    near-end address and port

     -    far-end address and port

     -    identification of the application layer protocol in use

     -    number of read requests

     -    number of bytes received

     -    time of last read request

     -    number of write requests

     -    number of bytes transmitted

     -    time of last write request

   The transaction statistics tables

   Entries in the transaction statistics table are indexed by the
   application element run index and an arbitrary integer, chosen so
   that taken together the application run index and this integer yield
   a unique key for each transaction stream associated with the running
   application element.  A transaction stream may be a file or a
   connection; a column in this table contains the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of
   the instance of applOpenConnectionOpenTime or applOpenFileOpenTime,
   in the open files table or open connections table respectively.  The
   information recorded in the entries of this table includes:

     -    Number of requests issued

     -    Bytes of requests issued

     -    Time of last request issued

     -    Number of responses issued

     -    Bytes of responses issued

     -    Time of last response issued

     -    Number of requests received

     -    Bytes of requests received

     -    Time of last request received

     -    Number of responses received

     -    Bytes of responses received

     -    Time of last response received

     -    Cumulative time between transmission of requests and receipt
          of corresponding responses

     -    Cumulative time between receipt of requests and transmission

          of corresponding responses

     The running application element status table

     This table provides information for a running application element.
     Indexed by the sysApplElmtRunIndex, an entry in this table reports
     useful information on that running element's resource usage.
     Entries in this table contain:

     -    current heap usage for this running application element

     -    current number of open network connections for this running
          application element

     Note that other information, such as the current number of open
     files for this running application element, is available from the
     sysapplElmtRunTable in [11].

     The running application element control table

     This table provides rudimentary control over a running application
     element.  Indexed by the sysApplElmtRunIndex, an entry in this
     table gives a manager with appropriate permissions the ability to
     suspend and resume processing by this running element, the ability
     to request reconfiguration, and the ability to terminate the
     running element.

     Variables in this table include:

     -    a suspend/resume control

     -    a reconfiguration request control

     -    a termination request control

     The application component details table

     This table provides time stamps, current size, ownership, and other
     information as it extends the sysApplInstallElmt table.

                identify each former connection in the context of
                a running application element.

                Entries for closed connections for a given running
                application element can be added to this table only
                if the running application element's entry in the

                Entries for closed connections are removed under
                the following circumstances:

                     - the running application element no longer
                       exists

                     - the corresponding

                       indicated by the corresponding

             DESCRIPTION
               "The applTransactionStreamTable contains entries,
                organized by running application element, for each
                open transaction stream.

                The simple model of a transaction used here looks
                like this:

                     invoker  |   Request     | performer
                              | - - - - - - > |
                              |               |
                              |   Response    |
                              | < - - - - - - |
                              |               |

                Since in some protocols it is possible for an entity
                to take on both the invoker and performer roles,
                information here is accumulated for transmitted
                and received requests, as well as for transmitted
                and received responses.  Counts are maintained
                for both transactions and bytes transferred."

6. Implementation Issues

   Unlike the system application MIB [11], in many environments support
   for much of this MIB requires instrumentation built into the managed
   resource.  Some tables may be implemented by a single monitor
   process; for others, the implementation may be distributed within the
   managed system with the resources being managed.

   As a practical matter, this means that the management infrastructure
   of the managed system must support different subagents taking
   responsibility for different rows of a single table.  This can be
   supported by Agentx [14] as well as other subagent protocols [15].

   The sysApplRunElmtIndex is the key connection between this MIB and
   the systems application MIB.  It is essential that implementations of
   this two running concurrently on a given platform employ a consistent
   policy for assigning this value to running application elements.

7. Security Considerations

   By making potentially sensitive information externally accessible,
   the capabilities supported by the MIB have the potential of becoming
   security problems.

   The tables in this MIB are organized to separate sensitive control
   capabilities from less sensitive usage information.  The MIB is
   structured to be useful for managers with read-only access rights.

   The capabilities supported by this MIB include several that may be of
   value to a security administrator.  These include the ability to
   monitor the level of usage of a given application, to verify
   licenses, and to check the integrity of application components.

11. Issues and List of Things Left To Be Done


        -    Decide which object definitions should be borrowed or
             reference from the ARM work.

        -    Resolve whether file I/O counters should be Counter32 or
             Counter64.

        -    Resolve how names for files like stdin, stdout, stderr and
             redirected streams should be be reported.

        -    For the file mode bits, should the open() model be used or
             should we go with the fopen() model?

        -    Do we need to report current mode in addition to open mode?
             For example, fcntl() can change append mode.

        -    The indexing of applOpenFileXrefTable by file name is
             problematic given the SNMP constraints on OBJECT IDENTIFIER
             length.

        -    The syntax for the identifiers for transport and
             application protocol identifiers should be narrowed down a
             bit.

        -    MIB definitions to support the following capabilities are
             still needed:

             -    system calls ?

             -    stack penetration ?

             -    other networking resources

             -    dependency information

             -    logging capability

        -    align with stdguide requirements

        -    add conformance clauses
