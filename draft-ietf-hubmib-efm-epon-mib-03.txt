2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based
   Internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing devices
   and interfaces that conform to the Ethernet Passive Optical Networks
   (EPON) standards as defined in [802.3].  The document contains a list
   of management entities based on the registers defined in [802.3]
   Annex 30A for EPON and partitioned accordingly.  The document also
   contains a device group section defining the MIB modules for EPON
   from a device perspective, that are connected directly to the IEEE
   802.3 EPON specifications.

4.  Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB and EPON device MIB to other MIBs

4.1  Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB to the Interfaces MIB

   Implementing this module MUST require implementation of Interfaces
   MIB module [RFC2863].  The MIB modules defined in this document are
   an extension of the MIB modules in this document.

4.2  Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB to the Ethernet-like Interfaces
    MIB

   Implementing this module MUST require implementation of Ethernet-like
   Interfaces MIB module [RFC3635].  The MIB modules defined in this
   document are an extension of the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
   modules.  For instance, the document is defining
   dot3MpcpRemoteMACAddress only while assuming the local MAC address
   attribute is already defined in [RFC3635].

4.3  Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB to the MAU MIB EFM EPON interfaces

   Implementing this module MUST require implementation of MAU-MIB
   module [RFC3636].  The MIB modules defined in this document are an
   extension of the MAU-MIB modules.

4.4  Relationship of the EFM EPON MIB to the EFM OAM MIB

   EFM EPON interfaces MUST require implementation of EFM OAM MIB module
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-mib].  This document defines OAM MIB module
   attributes and managed objects that are complementary to the EFM EPON
   MIB module.

4.5  Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to EFM EPON MIB

   EPON devices MUST require implementation of the EFM EPON MIB module
   which are specified in this document.  The opposite is not required
   as it possible to implement the EFM interfaces by itself.

4.6  Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to Optical interface MIB

   EPON devices MAY implement the Optical interface MIB module
   [RFC3591].  The optical interface MIB module document defines optical
   interface attributes and managed objects that are assumed to be used
   by an EPON device.

4.7  Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to bridge MIB

   EPON OLT devices MAY implement the bridge MIB modules [RFC1493],
   [RFC1525], Where the LLIDs of the PON are referred as the bridge

   ports.  There is a direct mapping between the bridge ports and the
   LLIDs, which are virtual bridge ports.  Attributes in the bridge MIB
   module should be used accordingly.  This document defines managed
   objects for a bridge that are assumed to be used by an EPON OLT
   device which bridges the data between the LLIDs of the PON.

4.8  Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to the Entity MIB

   EPON OLT devices MAY implement the Entity MIB modules [RFC2737],
   Where attributes like physical device ID and physical status,
   Hardware status are used from that MIB module

4.9  Relationship of the EPON Device MIB to the Entity Sensor MIB

   EPON OLT devices MAY implement the Entity Sensor MIB modules
   [RFC3433], where various attributes of sensors entities of the EPON
   device can be used from that MIB module

5.  IANA Considerations

   The EFM EPON MIB module requires the allocation of a single object
   identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY under the MIB-2 tree.  The EPON
   Device MIB module requires the allocation of a single object
   identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY under the MIB-2 tree.

6.  MIB structure

   This document includes two MIB modules, the first is the EFM EPON MIB
   module and the second is the EPON device MIB module.  The EFM EPON
   MIB module defines the objects used for configuration and description
   of the [802.3] Point to Multipoint (P2MP) section.  These MIB module
   objects are included in three MIB module groups.

   The Multi-Point Control Protocol (MPCP) MIB module definition - MIB
   module related to [802.3] clause 64 Multi Point Control Protocol
   attributes.  In this MIB module group: The dot3MpcpTable defines the
   objects used for the configuration and description of the status of
   MPCP ([802.3] Multi-Point Control Protocol) compliant interfaces.
   The dot3MpcpStatTable defines the statistics group for MPCP compliant
   interfaces.

   The OMPEmulation MIB module definitions - MIB module related to
   [802.3] clause 65 point to point emulation attributes.  In this MIB
   module group: The dot3OmpEmulationTable defines the objects used for
   the configuration and description of the status of OMPEmulation
   compliant interfaces.  The dot3OmpEmulationStatTable defines the
   statistics group for OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.

   The MAU MIB module definition including MAU type definitions and EPON
   MAU managed object related to [802.3] clause 60 and clause 65.  The
   dot3EponMauTable defines the objects used for the configuration and
   description of the status of MAU EPON compliant interfaces.


   The EPON Device MIB module defines the objects used for configuration
   and description of management objects for EPON compliant Devices.
   The eponDeviceControlTable defines the objects used for the
   configuration and description of the EPON compliant devices.  The
   eponDeviceRemoteMACAddressLLIDTable defines the objects used for
   configuration and description of the MacAddress to LLID table used
   for the bridge emulation of the EPON devices.  The
   eponDeviceStatTable defines the objects used for the statistics group
   of the EPON devices.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Writing to
   these objects can have a potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation: Including:

   Changing dot3MpcpAdminState state (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing dot3EponMauFecMode mode (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceObjectReset mode (Writing can be done all the
   time)

   Changing eponDeviceObjectFecEnabled mode (Writing can be done all the
   time)

   Changing eponDeviceObjectDeviceReadyMode (Writing can be done all the
   time)

   Changing eponDeviceObjectPowerDown (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceObjectReportNumThreshold (Writing can be done all
   the time)

   Changing eponDeviceObjectReportThreshold (Writing can be done all the
   time)

   Changing eponDeviceRemoteMACAddressLLIDControl (Writing can be done
   all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceRMadlLogID (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceRMadlLLID (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceRMadlRemoteAddress (Writing can be done all the
   time)

   Changing eponDeviceRMadlType (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceRMadlAction (Writing can be done all the time)

   Changing eponDeviceRMadlEntryStatus (Writing can be done all the
   time)


   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection

   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
