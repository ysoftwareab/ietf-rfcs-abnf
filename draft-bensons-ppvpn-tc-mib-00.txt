     1. Introduction 

         This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
         for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
         In particular, it defines Textual Conventions and OBJECT-IDENTITIES 
         used in IETF PPVPN and PPVPN-related MIBs. 
          
          
     1.1 Conventions Used in This Document 
          
         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
         "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
         document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 
         
          
     2. The SNMP Management Framework 
         
         The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five 
         major components: 
          
         -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 
            [RFC2571]. 
          
         -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and 
            events for the purpose of management.  The first 
            version of this Structure of Management Information 
            (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 
            1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD 16, 
            RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, 
            is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
            RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
          
         -  Message protocols for transferring management 
            information.  The first version of the SNMP message 
            protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 
            1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message 
            protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
            protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 
            [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version 
            of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described 
            in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 
            [RFC2574]. 
          
         -  Protocol operations for accessing management 
            information.  The first set of protocol operations and 
            associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 
            1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations 
            and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
            [RFC1905]. 
          
         -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 
            2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control 
            mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

         A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP 
         Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
         Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information 
         store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB. 
         Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms 
         defined in the SMI. 
          
         This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the 
         SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced 
         through the appropriate translations.  The resulting 
         translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except 
         where objects or events are omitted because no 
         translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine 
         readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into 
         textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation 
         process.  However, this loss of machine readable 
         information is not considered to change the semantics of 
         the MIB.

     4. Security Considerations 
          
         This memo defines textual conventions and object 
         identities for use in PPVPN MIB modules.  Security issues 
         for these MIB modules are addressed in the memos defining 
         those modules.
