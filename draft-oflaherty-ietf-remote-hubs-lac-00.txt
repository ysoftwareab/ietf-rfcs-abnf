                      Remote Hubs in Latin America
                draft-oflaherty-ietf-remote-hubs-lac-00

   Abstract

   This document describes experiences and lessons learnt organizing
   remote sessions for working group meetings in Latin America. The main
   objective is to engage people in the IETF through small and informal
   meetings with people that share common interests.

   At the same time, remote participation for those already active in
   the IETF is more attractive and they help with IETF outreach sharing
   their experiences with newcomers.  

   The local meetings are called remote IETF Working Group Hubs.

INTERNET DRAFT     oflaherty-ietf-remote-hubs-lac-00       March 9, 2019


1 Background

   IETF Remote Hubs are remote meetings for a working group session
   where a small group of people that share their interest and knowledge
   on a specific topic, meet locally to make their remote participation
   more attractive. This document is how this has been implemented in
   Latin America.

   There are groups of people at Universities or Companies that share
   their interest in certain Working Group or follow the same mailing
   lists but are not yet engaged in discussions and usually have never
   participated in a meeting. In most cases that lack of appropriate
   involvement or their daily responsibilities discourage them for being
   remote participants. IETF WG Remote hubs are local meetings for the
   working group they're following, where people can experience remote
   participation accompanied. The objective is to experience something
   closer to a real working group session, following the presentations
   and discussing issues locally and in their own language. 


2 Definition and goals

2.1 What is a remote hub?

   In Latin America, IETF WG Remote hubs are informal and small
   gatherings (usually less than 15 participants), using the standard
   IETF tools for remote participants, organized for a specific working
   group session (2-4 hours), usually during an IETF meeting. 

   Remote hubs can be public and open for anyone to attend or closed
   just for some invited participants.

2.2 What they are not

   Remote IETF WG Hubs are not remote IETF events were people can show
   up without invitation or attend for networking purposes. They usually
   do not provide food nor beverages or goodies. There's no exhibition,
   no social event (not even cookies).  

   The IETF WG remote hubs are not streaming the IETF meeting live
   during the whole day. 

3 Organization

   Remote hubs can be public (open invitation) or closed to invited
   people. It is up to the organizer the format and how to invite
   participants.

INTERNET DRAFT     oflaherty-ietf-remote-hubs-lac-00       March 9, 2019


   IETF Remote Hubs are not as complex to organize as other remote hubs
   such as ICANN's or IGF. The amount of people participating in an IETF
   WG remote hub is usually limited to those that are currently
   following that working group mailing list. The average attendance is
   between 5 and 10 participants. 

3.1 How to organize a remote hub

   In order to organize a remote hub you will need: 

3.1.1 Location: 

   The usual locations are meeting rooms when they're organized by
   companies or classrooms when they're organized by universities. The
   working group sessions can last up to four hours so it's desirable to
   have seats available for the participants. 


3.1.1 Organizer: 

   Individuals are usually the champions for IETF WG remote hubs.
   Someone currently active in a working group is usuarlly the main
   conviener.

   Any organization can host a remote Hub. Companies and Universities
   were the most common locations, but there were also remote IETF WG
   hubs organized at IXPs (Internet Exchange Points), ccTLDs (country
   code top level domain organizations) and RIR (Regional Internet
   Registry)

3.1.2 Internet access

   The bandwidth required is less than 1Mbps for a decent quality for
   both audio and video. 

3.1.3 Software Tools

   The preferred remote participation tool is Meetecho. It includes
   useful features for remote participants such as a virtual mike queue.
   The updated instructions for using Meetecho are located in the remote
   participants section in the meeting web page. As an example, for
   IETF-94: http://www.ietf.org/meeting/94/remote-
   participation.html#Meetecho.

   Since IETF91 in Honolulu, all sessions are supported by Meetecho. A
   synchronized view of the official jabber room, the slides being
   presented and an audio/video feed from the physical meeting room is
   made available for each Meetecho virtual room.

INTERNET DRAFT     oflaherty-ietf-remote-hubs-lac-00       March 9, 2019


   Remote participants can:

   1. View presentations and speakers in real-time;
   2. Use the Jabber room to make comments or ask questions;
   3. Join a virtual queue to interactively make comments or ask 
      questions over the in-room audio system.

   All audio/video functionality in Meetecho is WebRTC based, which
   means that, while alternative, non-interactive options are provided,
   a WebRTC compliant web browser (currently, either Chrome or Firefox
   or Opera) is needed for active (i.e., interactive) participation.
   That said, a WebRTC compliant browser is sometimes not enough, as the
   client network may employ filters or firewalls that might affect a
   successful WebRTC connectivity. Hence, in order to check whether or
   not the client is able to make use of WebRTC for the purpose, a
   simple self-test web application (directly reachable from the IETF
   remote participation web site) is provided. The self-test site will
   attempt to start an echo test that will try and capture client's
   audio and video, and bounce them back: if the client can see herself
   in both boxes and hear herself back, it means that everything is
   fine. If not, the Meetecho team has to be notified in order to fix
   things prior to the session's start time (so to avoid disrupting the
   natural flow of the meeting).

3.1.4 Projector or screen

   When the hub has no more than five participants there's no need to
   use a projector. A computer screen will be enough to follow the
   slides and video from the meeting. When more people are expected in
   the IETF WG remote hub, you will need a bigger room and a projector
   is usually required to se the remote slides properly.

3.1.5 Audio

   The audio could be less than optimal so the computer audio is not
   enough. Additional speakers are always recommended.

3.1.6 Microphone

   Be prepared to ask questions from your Hub. A microphone will be
   useful to improve the sound quality from your meeting room. Be
   prepared to mute your speakers if echo is experienced. When the
   meeting room is big, a wireless microphone will be better.

3.2 Planning for a remote hub

   1. Wait for the IETF agenda to be published

   2. Look for an available meeting room at the time slot when your
   Working Group meets

   3. Notify the IETF about your remote hub if you want it included in
   the public remote IETF WG Hubs list

   4. Invite participants (include your name, date, time, location and
   Working Group name)

   5. Test Meetecho before the Working Group session (see above for
   details about the self-test facility provided by Meetecho)

   6. Use jabber to notify the jabber scribe when your remote hub is
   online


4 Use of IETF name / brand

   Even though the IETF supports and encourages the organization of
   remote hubs, they're not official IETF activities. If you plan to
   host a remote hub, and you plan to publicly announce it to your
   community, please be careful not to use the IETF name or logo without
   authorization. In order to be complaint with current copyright
   requirements, please notify the appropriate people at IETF before
   doing any announcements.


5 IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

6 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
