Internet-Draft   Analysis of multiple interfaces in a MN    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   In future ubiquitous networks, many services and many access
   technologies are expected to be interworked and harmonized for better
   services.  To do so, a mobile node must have different access
   technologies and different network interfaces for each access
   technology [3].

   Mobile IPv6 [1] and NEMO Basic Support [2] can solve the problem of
   the change of IPv6 network address when a mobile node or a mobile
   router moves.  But these protocols are developed for a mobile node
   with a single network interface and a mobile router with a single
   egress network interface.  We can not directly use Mobile IPv6 for a
   mobile node with multiple network interfaces [4,5].  This document
   describes the problems of multiple interfaces in a mobile node as an
   aspect of a node.

2.  Problem Statements

2.1.  Mobile IPv6-specific Issues

   In Mobile IPv6, a mobile node knows its network movement by comparing
   the prefix information, which is included in the latest arrived
   Router Advertisement messages, with the prefix information, which is
   stored in locally or using other ways [6].  The operations required
   for handover such as Binding update or Binding Acknowledgement
   happens only after a mobile node determines the movement to different
   networks.

   To determine network movement, a mobile node carefully observes the
   received Router Advertisement messages from routers through one
   specific network interface.  Usually, the specific network interface
   is selected when Mobile IPv6 module starts.  In this case, the mobile
   node is focusing on only that network interface to detect movement.
   Router Advertisement messages that came from other network interfaces
   do not affect the operations of the mobile node (determination of
   movement detection) if the mobile node has multiple network
   interfaces and it observe only one specific network interface.

   When we apply Mobile IPv6 and the implementation of Mobile IPv6 code
   (HUT MIPL) [7] to a mobile node which has multiple network
   interfaces, we must consider Router Advertisement messages which are
   delivered through all network interfaces, not only the specific
   network interface, which is selected when Mobile IPv6 module start.
   When a mobile node has multiple network interfaces, a mobile node
   must have the ability to look at all Router Advertisement messages
   from different network interfaces because Router Advertisement
   messages may be delivered from different network interfaces.

2.2.  General Network Issues

   The primary purpose of Mobile IPv6 or NEMO Basic Support is to
   maintain a communication session even though the IPv6 address of a
   mobile node or a mobile router has changed when the mobile node or
   the mobile router moves.  As an application layer's view or socket
   layer's view, the address of a mobile node (Home Address) is not
   changed nevertheless the Care of Address is changed.  This rule must
   also be applied when multiple network interfaces are used in a mobile
   node.

   The problem of multiple network interfaces in a mobile node is the
   relation between a destination address and a network interface.  In
   the following case, we assume a mobile node with two network
   interfaces I1 and I2 of different access technologies.  Each
   interface is configured with a global IPv6 address, respectively IP1

   and IP2, and the address of a correspondent node is IP3.

        Figure 2.  Relation between destination address and network
                                   interfaces

   The mobile node uses Mobile IPv6 when it moves between networks.
   Before moving, when the mobile node uses (I1, IP1) and sends packets
   to a correspondent node, the source address and destination address
   of packets is (IP1, IP3) and the used network interface is I1.  If
   the mobile node moves other network N2, and then the mobile node uses
   (I2, IP2) and the used network interface is I2.  Before moving, the
   destination address (IP3) of the correspondent node is mapped to a
   network interface I1.  After moving, when an application tries to
   send packets to the correspondent node, it continually tries to use a
   network interface I1 if the relation of destination address IP3 and
   network interface I1 is not updated properly.  If this situation
   happens, even though, the network interface is changed to I2, packets
   are delivered to I1.  The communication sessions will be disrupted.
   To solve this problem, a mobile node must update the relation between
   a destination address and a network interface when it changes a
   network interface.

2.3.  Considerations for Heterogeneous Environments

   If a mobile node moves between networks with a single network
   interface, the change may be only a network address.  Because the
   mobile node has an access technology of the single network interface,
   it doesn't need to consider other aspects such as the change of
   access technologies and IP version.

   If a mobile node moves between networks with multiple network
   interfaces, other changes may happen.  If a mobile node has
   heterogeneous network interfaces (one is a WLAN interface and the
   other is a CDMA interface), changes include the network address,
   network interface and access technologies of the selected network
   interface after moving.  Currently in Korea, we can use IPv6 based
   WLAN service but it is impossible to use IPv6 based CDMA service.
   The deployment of IPv6 based CDMA service will be done sooner or
   later.  Until the deployment of IPv6 based CDMA service occur, if we
   want to use Mobile IPv6 or NEMO Basic Support with a CDMA network
   interface, we must consider how to use Mobile IPv6 or NEMO Basic
   Support in IPv4 based CDMA network.

3.  Conclusions

   Multihoming of a mobile node or a mobile router is an important issue
   as described in [3].  When a mobile node has multiple interfaces, the
   mobile node can use heterogeneous network interfaces and it can
   provide ubiquitous access.  In this document, we showed the issues
   when a mobile node or a mobile router has multiple network interfaces
   as an aspect of a node.  If a mobile node and a mobile router have
   multiple network interfaces, the mobile node and the mobile router
   must have the ability to look at all Router Advertisement messages
   from different network interfaces.  Also the mobile node and the
   mobile router must update dynamically the relation of a destination
   address of a correspondent node and a network interface after the
   change of a network interface.  Because the mobile node may use
   heterogeneous access technologies, some access networks of a selected
   network interface do not support IPv6.  In this case we must consider
   how to support Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support in IPv4 based
   networks.
