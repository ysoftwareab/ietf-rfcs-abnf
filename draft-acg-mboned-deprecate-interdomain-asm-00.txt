               Deprecating ASM for Interdomain Multicast
             draft-acg-mboned-deprecate-interdomain-asm-00

Abstract

   This document recommends the deprecation of the use of Any-Source
   Multicast (ASM) for interdomain multicast.  It therefore implicitly
   recommends the use of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) for interdomain
   multicast applications, and that hosts and routers that are expected
   to handle such applications fully support SSM.  The recommendations
   in this document do not preclude the continued use of ASM within a
   single organisation or domain.

1.  Introduction

   IP Multicast has been deployed in various forms, both within private
   networks and on the wider Internet.  While a number of service models
   have been published, and in many cases revised over time, there has
   been no strong recommendation made on the appropriateness of those
   models to certain scenarios.  This document addresses this gap by
   making a BCP-level recommendation to deprecate the use of ASM for
   interdomain multicast, and thus implictly also that all hosts and
   routers that are expected to support such multicast applications
   fully support SSM.

   This document does not make any statement on the use of ASM within in
   a single domain or organisation, and therefore does not preclude its
   use.  Indeed, there may be a number of application contexts for which
   ASM is currently still considered well-suited within a single domain.

2.  Multicast routing protocols

   The general IP multicast service model [RFC1112] is that sender(s)
   send to a multicast group address, receivers express an interest in
   traffic sent to a given multicast group address, and that routers use
   multicast routing protocols to determine how to deliver traffic from
   the sender(s) to the receivers.

   Two high-level flavours of this service model have evolved over time.
   In Any-Source Multicast (ASM), any number of sources may transmit
   multicast packets, and those sources may come and go over the course
   of a multicast session without being known a priori.  In ASM,
   receivers express interest only in a given multicast group address,
   and the multicast routing protocol facilitates source discovery at
   the network layer.  In contrast, with Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)
   the specific source(s) that may send traffic to the group are known
   in advance, or may be determined during a session, typically through
   an out-of-band protocol sitting above the network layer.  Thus in
   SSM, receivers express interest in both a multicast group address and
   specific associated source address(es).

   IANA has reserved specific ranges of IPv4 and IPv6 address space for
   multicast addressing.  Guidelines for IPv4 multicast address
   assignments can be found in [RFC5771], while guidelines for IPv6
   multicast address assignments can be found in [RFC2375] and
   [RFC3307].  The IPv6 multicast address format is described in
   [RFC4291].

2.1.  ASM routing protocols

   The most commonly deployed ASM routing protocol is Protocol
   Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode, or PIM-SM, as detailed in
   [RFC7761].  PIM-SM, as the name suggests, was designed to be used in
   scenarios where the subnets with receivers are sparsely distributed
   throughout the network.  Because it does not know sender addresses in
   advance, PIM-SM uses the concept of a Rendezvous Point (RP) to 'marry
   up' senders and receivers, where all routers in a PIM-SM domain are
   configured to use specific RP(s).

   To enable PIM-SM to work between multiple domains, i.e. to allow an
   RP in one domain to learn the existence of a source in another
   domain, an inter-RP signalling protocol known as Multicast Source
   Discovery Protocol (MSDP) [RFC3618] is used.  Deployment scenarios
   for MSDP are given in [RFC4611].  MSDP has remained an Experimental
   protocol since its publication in 2003, and was not replicated or
   carried forward for IPv6.

Internet-Draft         Deprecating Interdomain ASM            March 2018


   In the absence of MSDP, a new mechanism, Embedded-RP [RFC3956], was
   defined for IPv6 PIM-SM, which allows routers supporting the protocol
   to determine the RP for the group without any prior configuration,
   simply by observing the RP address that is embedded (included) in the
   IPv6 multicast group address.  Embedded-RP allows PIM-SM operation
   across any IPv6 network in which there is an end-to-end path of
   routers supporting the protocol.

2.2.  SSM Routing protocols

   PIM-SSM is detailed in [RFC4607].  In contrast to PIM-SM, PIM-SSM
   benefits from sender source address(es) being known about in advance,
   i.e. a given source's IP address is known (by some out of band
   mechanism), and thus the receiver's router can send a PIM JOIN
   directly towards the sender, without needing to use an RP.

   IPv4 addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are
   designated as source-specific multicast (SSM) destination addresses
   and are reserved for use by source-specific applications and
   protocols.  For IPv6, the address prefix FF3x::/32 is reserved for
   source-specific multicast use.

3.  Discussion

3.1.  Observations on ASM and SSM deployments

   In enterprise and campus scenarios, ASM in the form of PIM-SM is in
   relatively common use, and has generally replaced PIM-DM [RFC3973].
   The configuration and management of an RP within a single domain is
   not onerous.  However, if interworking with external PIM domains in
   IPv4 multicast deployments is needed, MSDP is required to exchange
   information between domain RPs about sources.  MSDP remains an
   Experimental protocol, and can be a complex and fragile protocol to
   administer and troubleshoot.

   PIM-SM is a general purpose protocol that can handle all use cases.
   In particular, it was designed for cases such as videoconferencing
   where multiple sources may come and go during a multicast session.
   But for cases where a single, persistent source is used, and
   receivers can be configured to know of that source, PIM-SM has
   unnecessary complexity.

   MSDP was not taken forward to IPv6.  Instead, IPv6 has Embedded-RP,
   which allows the RP address for a multicast group to be embedded in
   the group address, making RP discovery automatic, if all routers on
   the path between a receiver and a sender support the protocol.
   Embedded-RP can support lightweight ad-hoc deployments.  However, it
   relies on a single RP for an entire group.  Embedded-RP was run

   successfully between European and US academic networks during the
   6NET project in 2004/05.  Its usage generally remains constrained to
   academic networks.

   As stated in RFC 4607, SSM is particularly well-suited to
   dissemination-style applications with one or more senders whose
   identities are known (by some mechanism) before the application
   starts running.  PIM-SSM is therefore very well-suited to
   applications such as classic linear broadcast TV over IP.

   SSM requires hosts and their subnet routers using it support the
   new(er) IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and MLDv2 [RFC3810] protocols.  While
   delayed delivery of support in some OSes has meant that adoption of
   SSM has also been slower than might have been expected, or hoped, and
   was a historical reason to use ASM rather than SSM, support for
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 is now widespread in common OSes.

3.2.  Advantages of SSM for interdomain multicast

   A significant benefit of SSM is its reduced complexity through
   eliminating the network-based source discovery required in ASM.  This
   means there are no RPs, shared trees, Shortest Path Tree (SPT)
   switchovers, PIM registers, MSDP or data-driven state creation
   elements to support.  SSM is really just a small subset of PIM-SM,
   plus IGMPv3 / MLDv2.

   This reduced complexity makes SSM radically simpler to manage,
   troubleshoot and operate, particularly for network backbone
   operators, and this is the main motivation for the recommendation to
   deprecate the use of ASM in interdomain scenarios.  Interdomain ASM
   is widely viewed as complicated and fragile.  By eliminating network-
   based source discovery for interdomain multicast, the vast majority
   of the complexity issues go away.

   RFC 4607 details many benefits of SSM, including:

      "Elimination of cross-delivery of traffic when two sources
      simultaneously use the same source-specific destination address;

      Avoidance of the need for inter-host coordination when choosing
      source-specific addresses, as a consequence of the above;

      Avoidance of many of the router protocols and algorithms that are
      needed to provide the ASM service model."

   Further discussion can also be found in [RFC3569].

Internet-Draft         Deprecating Interdomain ASM            March 2018


   SSM is considered more secure in that it supports access control,
   i.e. you only get packets from the sources you explicitly ask for, as
   opposed to ASM where anyone can decide to send traffic to a PIM-SM
   group address.  This topic is expanded upon in [RFC4609].

4.  Recommendations

4.1.  Deprecating use of ASM for interdomain multicast

   This document recommends that the use of ASM is deprecated for
   interdomain multicast, and thus implictly that hosts and routers that
   are expected to support such interdomain applications fully support
   SSM.  Best current practices for deploying interdomain multicast
   using SSM are documented in [RFC8313]

   The recommendation applies to the use of ASM between domains where
   either MSDP (IPv4) or Embedded-RP (IPv6) is required for sharing
   knowledge of remote sources.  It also recommends against the multi-
   domain use of an ASM group with a single RP in one domain, where
   multicast tunnels are used between domains.

   While MSDP is an Experimental level standard, this document does not
   propose making MSDP Historic, given its use may be desirable for
   intradomain multicast use cases.

4.2.  Including network support for IGMPv3 / MLDv2

   This document recommends that all host and router platforms
   supporting multicast, and any security appliances that may handle
   multicat traffic, support IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and MLDv2 [RFC3810].  The
   updated IPv6 Node Requirements RFC [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6434-bis] states
   that MLDv2 support is a MUST in all implementations.  Such support is
   already widespread in common host and router platforms.

   Further guidance on IGMPv3 and MLDv2 is given in [RFC4604].

   It is sometimes desirable to limit the propagation of multicast
   messages in a layer 2 network, typically through a layer 2 switch
   device.  In such cases multicast snooping can be used, by which the
   switch device observes the IGMP/MLD traffic passing through it, and
   then attempts to make intelligent decisions on which physical ports
   to forward multicast.  Typically, ports that have not expressed an
   interest in receiving multicast for a given group would not have
   traffic for that group forwarded through them.  Such snooping
   capability should support IGMPv3 and MLDv2.  There is further
   discussion in [RFC4541].

4.3.  Building application support for SSM

   There will be a wide range of applications today that only support
   ASM, whether as software packages, or code embedded in devices such
   as set-top boxes.

   The implicit recommendation to use SSM for interdomain multicast
   means that applications should use SSM, and operate correctly in an
   SSM environment, triggering IGMPv3/MLDv2 messages to signal use of
   SSM.

   It is often thought that ASM is required for multicast applications
   where there are multiple sources.  However, RFC 4607 also describes
   how SSM can be used instead of PIM-SM for multi-party applications:

      "SSM can be used to build multi-source applications where all
      participants' identities are not known in advance, but the multi-
      source "rendezvous" functionality does not occur in the network
      layer in this case.  Just like in an application that uses unicast
      as the underlying transport, this functionality can be implemented
      by the application or by an application-layer library."

   Given all common OSes support SSM, it is then down to the programming
   language and APIs used as to whether the necessary SSM APIs are
   available.  SSM support is generally quite ubiquitous, with the
   current exception of websockets used in web-browser based
   applications.

   It is desirable that applications also support appropriate congestion
   control, as described in [RFC8085], with appropriate codecs, to
   achieve the necessary rate adaption.

   Some useful considerations for multicast applications can still be
   found in the relatively old [RFC3170].

4.4.  Standardising an ASM/SSM protocol mapping mechanism

   In the case of existing ASM applications that cannot readily be
   ported to SSM, it may be possible to use some form of protocol
   mapping, i.e., to have a mechanism to translate a (*,G) join or leave
   to a (S,G) join or leave, for a specific source, S.  The general
   challenge in performing such mapping is determining where the
   configured source address, S, comes from.

   There are some existing vendor-specific mechanisms to achieve this
   function, but none are documented in IETF standards.  This appears ti
   be a useful area for the IETF to work on, but it should be noted that
   any such effort would only be an interim transition mechanism, and



Abrahamsson, et al.     Expires September 4, 2018               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Deprecating Interdomain ASM            March 2018


   such mappings do not remove the requirement for applications to be
   allocated ASM group addresses for the communications.

4.5.  Not filtering ASM addressing between domains

   A key benefit of SSM is that the multicast application does not need
   to be allocated a specific multicast group by the network, rather as
   SSM is inherently source-specific, it can use any group address, G,
   in the reserved range of IPv4 or IPv6 SSM addresses for its own
   source address, S.

   In principle, if interdomain ASM is deprecated, backbone operators
   could begin filtering the ranges of group addresses used by ASM.  In
   practice, this is not recommended given there will be a transition
   period from ASM to SSM, where some form of ASM-SSM mappings may be
   used, and filtering may preclude such operations.

4.6.  Not precluding Intradomain ASM

   The use of ASM within a single multicast domain, such as an
   enterprise or campus, with an RP for the site, is still relatively
   common today.  The operators of such a site may choose to use
   Anycast-RP [RFC4610] or MSDP for internal RP resilience, at the
   expense of the extra complexity in managing that configuration.

   This document does not preclude continued use of ASM in the
   intradomain scenario.  If an organisation, or AS, wishes to use
   multiple multicast domains within its own network border, that is a
   choice for that organisation to make, and it may then use MSDP or
   Embedded-RP internally within its own network.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document adds no new security considerations.  RFC 4609
   describes the additional security benefits of using SSM instead of
   ASM.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed upon publication as
   an RFC.
