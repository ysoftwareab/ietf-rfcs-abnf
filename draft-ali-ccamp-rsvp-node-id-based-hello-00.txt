Abstract 

   Use of node-id based RSVP Hello messages is implied in a number of 
   cases, e.g., when data and control plan are separated, when TE links 
   are unnumbered. Furthermore, when link level failure detection is 
   performed by some means other than RSVP Hellos, use of node-id based 
   Hellos is optimal for node failure detection. Nonetheless, this 
   implied behavior is unclear and this informational draft clarifies 
   use of node-id based RSVP Hellos.

1. Terminology 
                   
   Node-id: Router-id as defined in the Router Address TLV for OSPF 
   [OSPF-TE] and Traffic Engineering router ID TLV for ISIS [ISIS-TE]. 

   Node-id based Hello Session: A Hello session such that local and 
   remote node-ids are used in the source and destination fields of the 
   Hello packet, respectively. 

   Interface bounded Hello Session: A Hello session such that local and 
   remote addresses of the interface in question are used in the source 
   and destination fields of the Hello packet, respectively.  

2. Introduction 
 
   The RSVP Hello protocol was introduced in [RFC 3209]. The usage of 
   RSVP Hello protocol is over-loaded in [RFC 3473] to support RSVP 
   Graceful Restart (GR) procedures. Specifically, [RFC 3473] specifies 
   the use of the RSVP Hello protocol for GR procedures for Generalized 
   MPLS (GMPLS). GMPLS introduces the notion of control plane and data 
   plane separation. In other words, in GMPLS networks, the control 
   information is carried over a control network, which may be 
   physically different than the data network. The notion of separation 
   of data and control plane also applies to the Optical User Network 
   Interface (O-UNI) 1.0 Signaling Specification [OIF-UNI], which reuses 
   the RSVP GR procedures defined in [RFC 3473]. One of the consequences 
   of separation of data bearer links from control channels is that RSVP 
   Hellos are not exchanged over data links; instead hellos use the 
   control channel. Consequently, the use of RSVP Hellos for GR 
   applications introduces a need for node-id based Hellos. Nonetheless, 
   this implied behavior is unclear and this draft clarifies the usage.

   Another scenario which introduces the need for node-id based Hellos 
   is when nodes support unnumbered TE links. Specifically, when all TE 
   links between neighbor nodes are unnumbered, it is implied that the 
   nodes will use node-id based Hellos for detecting node failures. This 
   draft also clarifies the use of node-id based Hellos when all or a 
   sub-set of TE links are unnumbered. 
 
   When link level failure detection is performed by some means other 
   than RSVP Hellos (e.g., [BFD]), the use of node-id based Hellos is 
   also optimal for detection of nodal failures.  

3. Node-id based RSVP Hellos 
    
   A node-id based Hello session is established through the exchange of 
   RSVP Hello messages such that local and remote node-ids are 
   respectively used in the source and destination fields of Hello 
   packets. Here, node-id refers to a router-id as defined in the Router 
   Address TLV for OSPF [OSPF-TE] and the Traffic Engineering router ID 
   TLV for ISIS [ISIS-TE]. This section formalizes a procedure for 
   establishing node-id based Hello sessions. 

   If a node wishes to establish a node-id based RSVP Hello session with 
   its neighbor, it sends a Hello Request message with its node-id in 
   the source IP address field of the Hello packet. Furthermore, the 
   node also puts the neighbor∆s node-id in the destination address 
   field of the IP packet. 
 
   An implementation may initiate a node-id based Hello session when it 
   starts sharing RSVP states with the neighbor or at an earlier time. 
   Similarly, an implementation may use the IGP topology to determine 
   the remote node-id which matches an interface address(es) used in 
   RSVP signaling. These aspects are considered to be a local 
   implementation decision. 

   When a node receives a Hello packet where the destination IP address 
   is its local node-id as advertised in the IGP-TE topology, the node 
   MUST use its node-id in replying to the Hello message. In other 
   words, nodes must ensure that the node-ids used in RSVP Hello 
   messages are those derived/contained in the IGP-TE topology. 
   Furthermore, a node can only run one node-id based RSVP Hello session 
   with its neighbor. 
  
   If all interfaces between a pair of nodes are unnumbered, the optimal 
   way to use RSVP to detect nodal failure is to run node-id based 
   Hellos. Similarly, when link level failure detection is performed by 
   some means other than RSVP Hellos, use of node-id based Hellos is 
   also optimal in detecting nodal failures. Therefore, if all 
   interfaces between a pair of nodes are unnumbered or when link level 
   failure detection is performed by some means other than RSVP Hellos, 
   a node MUST run node-id based Hellos for node failure detection. 
   Nonetheless, if it is desirable to distinguish between node and link 
   failures, node id based Hellos can co-exist with interface bound

   Hellos. Similarly, if a pair of nodes share numbered and unnumbered 
   TE links, node id and interface based Hellos can co-exist.  

4. Backward Compatibility Note 
    
   The procedure presented in this draft is backward compatible with 
   both [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  

5. Security Considerations 
    
     This document does not introduce new security issues. The security 
   considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol [RFC2205] 
   remain relevant.

   Ayyangar and Carol Iturralde for their useful comments and 
   suggestions.
