     Abstract 

     This document defines new terms for benchmarking of LDP convergence. 
     These  terms  are  to  be  used  in  future  methodology  documents  for 
     benchmarking LDP Convergence.  Existing BMWG terminology documents such 
     as IGP Convergence Benchmarking [3] provide useful terms for LDP 
     Convergence benchmarking.  These terms are discussed in this document.  
     Applicable terminology for MPLS and LDP defined in MPLS WG RFCs [1] and 
     [2] is also discussed.

     1. Introduction 

     This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking LDP Convergence.  
     An  accompanying  document  describes  the  methodology  for  doing  the 
     benchmarking [TBD].  The main motivation for doing this work is the 
     increased focus on lowering convergence time for LDP as an alternative 
     to other solutions such as MPLS Fast Reroute (i.e. protection techniques 
     using RSVP-TE extensions). 
      
     The purpose of this documents is to find existing terminology as well 
     as define new terminology when needed terms are not available.  The 
     terminology will support the methodology that will be based on black-box 
     testing of the LDP dataplane.  The approach is very similar to the one 
     found in [3] and [4].

        Definition: 
          The occurrence of a planned or unplanned action in the network 
          that results in a change to an LSR's LDP next-hop forwarding. 
         
        Discussion: 
          Convergence Events include link loss, routing protocol session 
          loss, router failure, and better next-hop.  Also, different types 
          of administrative events such as interface shutdown is 
          considered.

        Definition: 
          Recovery from a FEC Convergence Event that causes the FEC 
          Forwarding Table to change and re-stabilize. 
         
        Discussion: 
          FEC Forwarding Table Convergence updates after the RIB and LDP 
          Binding Table update due to a FEC Convergence Event.  FEC 
          Forwarding Table Convergence can be observed externally by the 
          rerouting of data Traffic to a new egress interface.

          Table to change and re-stabilize. 
         
        Discussion: 
          FEC Convergence is a change in an LDP Binding of a prefix and 
          label to a peer's LDP Identifier.  This change can be an update or 
          recovery due to a FEC Convergence Event.  FEC Convergence is an 
          LSR action made prior to FEC Forwarding Table Convergence.  FEC 
          Convergence is not an externally observable Black-Box measurement.

          and interface.

          This typically happens when a Targeted Peer is established over a  
          traffic engineered tunnel.

     3.13  Equal Cost Multiple Paths 
      
        Definition: 
          Existence of multiple IGP paths to reach a particular destination.  
          In this case the depending on the implementation traffic destined 
          to a prefix that has multiple equal cost paths is load balanced  
          across all these paths.

     3.14  Equal Cost Multiple FECs 
         
        Definition: 
          Existence multiple FECs to reach a destination. Typically the LSR 
          that has multiple FECs of equal costs does a load balance on all   
          the FECs

     3.15  FEC Convergence at Ingress LSR 
         
        Definition: 
          Recovery from a FEC Convergence Event that causes the LDP Binding 
          Table to change and re-stabilize at the Ingress LSR 
         
        Discussion: 
          FEC Convergence is a change in an LDP Binding of a prefix and 
          label to a peer's LDP Identifier.  This change can be an update or 
          recovery due to a FEC Convergence Event.  FEC Convergence is an 
          LSR action made prior to FEC Forwarding Table Convergence.  FEC 
          Convergence is not an externally observable Black-Box measurement.

     4.  Security Considerations 

         Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of 
         the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking 
         is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating 
         networks.
