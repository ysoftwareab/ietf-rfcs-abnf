1.  Introduction

   Many multi-domain use cases are emerging with the development of new
   technologies, such as software-defined networking (SDN), network
   function virtualization (NFV), and 5G.  Examples of such use cases
   include multi-domain, collaborative data
   sciences [CMS][LCLS][LHC][SKA], multi-domain service function
   chaining (SFC) [NGMN-5G][SFC-MD][MD-ORCH-NFV][ETSI-ZSM], and multi-
   domain SDN [SFP][SDX][RFC5575].  Such use cases can benefit
   substantially from the exposure of network information, with which
   users can perform application-layer resource optimization to improve
   the performance.

   The Application-Layer Optimization Protocol (ALTO) [RFC7285] already
   introduces basic mechanisms (e.g., modularity, dependency) and
   abstractions (e.g., map services) for applications to take optimized
   actions based on network information.  However, exposing network
   information to support multi-domain use cases places additional
   requirements that existing solutions such as the current ALTO design
   do not satisfy.  First, abstractions that aggregate multiple networks
   into a single, virtual network are required to simplify the
   application-layer optimization conducted by end-users.  Second, such
   abstractions need to provide a unified representation of multiple
   resources (e.g., networking, computation, and storage) in multiple
   networks.

   This document reviews the current ALTO architecture to expose network
   information for applications (Section 3), and it then presents
   several important multi-domain use cases that can benefit
   substantially from network information exposure (Section 4).  Next,
   it elaborates the key design requirements of network information
   exposure to support these use cases (Section 5), followed by proposed
   extensions in the ALTO working group to satisfy the design
   requirements [MD-E2E-NS][UNIF-REPR]
   [MD-USE-CASES][BROKER-MDO][MD-ANALYTICS][MD-SFC-ALTO].  Finally, it
   summarizes novel mechanisms and abstractions based on recent research
   to improve the ALTO framework in the multi-domain set-
   up [MERCATOR][BOXOPT][SDI] (Section 6).

2.  Changes Since Version -01

   o  Introduce the basic idea of the multi-domain resource abstraction
      obfuscation mechanism in Section 6.2.3.  "Frome Single Domain to
      Multiple Domains".

   o  Fix some editorial errors in the drafts.

3.  Network Information Exposure: Current ALTO Context

   ALTO already provides a generic framework to expose network
   information for applications to improve their performance.  Figure 1
   presents a high-level overview of key ALTO mechanisms and
   abstractions.

   In particular, ALTO introduces generic mechanisms such as:

   o  Modularity and flexibility through an explicit division of ALTO
      network information into (network) information resources.

   o  An information resource directory (IRD) providing a list of
      available information resources in an ALTO server.

   o  Information consistency (tag, dependency, multi-info
      resources [ALTO-MULTIPART]) to specify a dependency among
      different information resources.

   o  A generic framework with Server-Sent Events (SSEs) [ALTO-SSE] to
      perform stream-control, push, incremental update of information
      resources.

   ALTO also introduces abstractions modules, such as:

   o  Network and cost maps to provide network location groupings and
      costs between them.

   o  A multi-cost map [RFC8189] to retrieve several cost metrics in a
      single query/response transaction.

   o  The path vector abstraction [ALTO-PATH] to provide more detailed
      routing information using Abstract Network Elements (ANEs).

   o  Capability maps (e.g., CDNI [ALTO-CDNI] and unified property
      Map [ALTO-PROP]).

   Another generic concept introduced is filter so that information
   resources can be filtered (e.g., Filtered network map, filtered cost
   map).  Besides, each individual information resource is provided as a

   RESTful service with a very simple, but well-working grammar
   (essentially JSON grammar [RFC7159]).

   Server discovery [RFC7286] and cross-domain server
   discovery [ALTO-XDOM] are also introduced in order to identify a
   topologically nearby ALTO server or ALTO servers outside of a network
   domain, respectively.

4.  Multi-domain Use Cases

   Multi-domain network information exposure can be beneficial in
   supporting multiple important use cases, including multi-domain,
   collaborative data sciences, multi-domain SFC, and multi-domain SDN.

Internet-Draft      Multi-domain use cases with ALTO           July 2021


4.1.  Multi-domain, collaborative data sciences

   Many of today's premier science experiments, such as the Large Hadron
   Collider (LHC) [LHC] and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) [SKA], rely
   on finely-tuned workflows that coordinate geographically distributed
   resources (e.g., instrument, compute, storage) to enable scientific
   discoveries.  One example is the movement of LHC data from Tier 0
   (i.e., the data center at the European Organization for Nuclear
   Research, known as CERN) to Tier 1 (i.e., national laboratories)
   storage sites around the world.  Another example is that the Fermilab
   is experimenting with moving the exascale LHC workflow to Amazon EC2
   for more computation power [HEPCLOUD].

   The key to supporting these distributed workflows is the ability to
   orchestrate multiple resources across multiple network domains to
   facilitate predictable workflow performance (e.g., available
   bandwidth, packet loss rate [ALTO-METRICS]).  As such, multi-domain
   network information exposure is a cornerstone to enable this ability.

4.1.1.  How can multi-domain resource orchestration benefit from ALTO?

   One key design challenge for multi-domain resource orchestration is
   its resource information model.  Existing design options such as
   resource graph and ClassAds are inadequate because they cannot
   simultaneously (1) allow member networks to provide accurate
   information on different types of resource, (2) avoid the exposure of
   private information of member networks such as topology, and (3)
   allow data analytics jobs to describe their requirements of different
   types of resources accurately.  In contrast, ALTO is well suited for
   providing a generic representation that (1) allows different types of
   data analytics jobs to accurately describe their resource
   requirements and (2) allows member networks to provide accurate
   information on different types of resources they own and at the same
   time maintain their privacies.

4.1.2.  Example

   Consider an example of three member networks in Figure 2, where s1
   and s2 are storage endpoints, and d1 and d2 are computation
   endpoints.  Assume a data analytics job is composed of two parallel
   tasks T1 and T2.  T1 needs dataset X as input, and T2 needs dataset Y
   as input.

                   '-------------'        '------------'


              Figure 2: Multi-domain resource orchestration.

   Using the ALTO endpoint property service, an ALTO client in the
   resource orchestrator can discover that d1 satisfies the computing
   requirements of T1, and d2 satisfies the computing requirements of
   T2.  Hence there are only two candidate endpoint pairs: (s1, d1) and
   (s2, d2).

   Afterward, using the ALTO path vector extension, the ALTO client can
   retrieve the bandwidth sharing information of task T1 and T2, denoted
   as x1 and x2, respectively, as follows:


                       A: x1 + x2 <= 10Mbps
                       B:      x1 <= 3Mbps
                       C:      x2 <= 3Mbps


   With such information, the resource orchestrator can make the optimal
   resource orchestration decision to reserve 3 Mbps bandwidth for task
   T1, and 3 Mbps bandwidth for task T2.

4.2.  Multi-domain SFC

   This use case refers to building end-to-end services by composing
   multiple service functions (SFs) in an abstract sequence across
   multiple network domains [SFC-MD].  It is identified as an important
   value-added service in 5G [MD-ORCH-NFV][ETSI-ZSM].  Exposing multi-
   domain network and resource information (e.g., link bandwidth, CPU
   utilization) can substantially improve the efficiency of constructing
   and managing such SFCs.

4.2.1.  How can multi-domain SFC benefit from ALTO?

   A "dialogue" between potential domains that provide multi-domain SFC
   could be beneficial for more efficient use of resources and
   increasing the SFC performance.  However, constrained knowledge of
   the network services and underlying network topology based only on
   localized views from the point of view of a single domain limits the
   potential and scope for multi-domain SFC.  ALTO (and customized ALTO
   extensions) can be used to offer aggregated/abstracted views on
   various types of information, including domain-level topology,
   storage resources, computation resources, networking resources, and
   SF capabilities.  This generic representation contributes to a more
   simple and scalable solution for resource and service discovery in
   multi-domain, multi-technology environments.

4.2.2.  Example

   Figure 3 shows a SFC eXchange Platform (SXP), connecting three
   different domains (AS1, AS2, AS3).  A SXP is a logical entity to make
   possible the negotiation between different domains, and it could be
   deployed, for example, in future Software-defined IXP (as a trusted
   third-party platform) [HH-MDSFC].

   In this scenario, each domain provides different SFs: AS1 = {SF1};
   AS2 = {SF2, SF3}; and AS3 = {SF3}.  The SXP also includes an ALTO
   server component to provide abstract topology, resource, and service
   information for the high-level control plane in each domain
   [MD-SFC-ALTO].

   The ALTO Property Map Service [DRAFT-ALTO-PM] can provide a clear
   global view of the resource information offered by other domains.
   This information allows discovering which candidate domains may be
   contacted to deliver the remaining requirements of a requested end-
   to-end service deployment.  In our example, the Property Map (see
   Table 1) includes a property value grouped by AS.  This value
   contains the supported SFs.  Additional properties could be
   considered, such as resource availability (e.g., CPUs, Memory, and
   Storage), orchestrator entry points, etc.

   Once the candidate domains are discovered, it is necessary to compute
   multi-domain SF paths to select the SF location from those different
   candidate domains.  The connectivity information among discovered
   domains can be retrieved by an ALTO Cost Map service.  In our
   example, the Cost Map defines a path vector as an array of ASes,
   representing the AS-level topological distance for a given SFC
   request.  Table 2 below shows a brief example of a service request
   and its multi-domain SF path response containing a list of potential
   domains to be traversed to deliver such service.

4.3.  Multi-domain SDN

   Network providers are expanding the fine-grained capability of SDN
   from intradomain set-up to multi-domain settings to provide flexible
   interdomain routing as a valuable service [SFP][SDX][RFC5575].  Users
   of this service can specify routing actions at the provider network
   based on flexible matching conditions of flow parameters such as TCP/
   IP 5-tuple.  This service requires provider networks to expose their
   available routing information to users.  However, handling routing
   information of each network individually is too complex for users.
   As such, a multi-domain network exposure solution that aggregates
   information of multiple networks into a single abstraction can
   simplify the use of this service.

4.3.1.  How can flexible interdomain routing benefit from ALTO?

   ALTO provides provider ASes a standardized approach to expose its
   routing capability to client ASes.  Traditional interdomain routing
   protocols such as BGP are not good options because they only expose



Lachos, et al.          Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Multi-domain use cases with ALTO           July 2021


   the currently used routes, limiting client ASes' choices to specify
   flexible routes.  In contrast, ALTO and its extensions provide
   interfaces for provider ASes to expose not only currently used
   routes, but also available yet unused routes, to client ASes so that
   they can have the flexibility to specify different routes for
   different data traffic.

4.3.2.  Example

   Consider the example in Figure 4.  AS A is compromised and being used
   to send DDoS traffic to AS E.  Without flexible interdomain routing,
   AS E can setup a firewall locally, but normal traffic from B to E
   will still be congested at C-D-E due to the existence of malicious
   traffic from A to E.  If AS C provides flexible interdomain routing
   service, AS E can specify such a firewall at AS C to block DDoS
   traffic from A, and at the same time avoid the congestion of normal
   traffic from B to E.

5.  Requirements on Multi-domain Network Information Exposure

   Supporting previous use cases with multi-domain network information
   exposure places new, key requirements, which are not fully satisfied
   by existing exposure solutions.  This section discusses these
   requirements and briefly review existing efforts in the ALTO working
   group aiming to satisfy them.

5.1.  Design Requirements

   o  Unified Resource Capability Representation.  Modern use cases
      require information on properties and capabilities of diverse in-
      network resources, including transport resources (e.g., available
      bandwidth), processing resources (e.g., SFs), and storage
      resources.  These use cases may then conduct orchestration of
      multiple resources in multiple networks (e.g., RAN, transport,

      core in 5G).  As such, a unified representation of capabilities of
      multiple resources is key requirement for multi-domain network
      information exposure to support multi-domain use cases.

   o  Multi-domain, easy-to-compose, end-to-end representation.
      Existing representations (e.g., ALTO network/cost maps, generic
      YANG models) tend to focus on a single domain.  In multi-domain
      use cases, related information can be retrieved from multiple
      networks to compute end-to-end information.  As such, abstractions
      that support aggregation of multiple networks into a single,
      virtual network ("one-big-network") are a key requirement.

   o  Providing interfaces for more flexible queries.  With the emerging
      of new networking architecture (e.g., SDN and NFV) and the fine-
      grained resource requirement of applications (e.g., link-disjoint
      paths and endpoint precedence), applications need a more flexible
      interface to specify queries of resource information.

5.2.  Existing Efforts in the ALTO Working Group

   Several documents have been submitted to the ALTO working group, with
   the aim to satisfy one or more of the design requirements discussed
   above.

   o  [DRAFT-RSA][DRAFT-UNICORN-INFO] documents propose and apply the
      ALTO path vector extension to provide accurate networking resource
      information to support multi-domain resource orchestration.

   o  [BROKER-MDO] proposes to use ALTO to support resource
      orchestration for multi-domain SFC, and proposes a new ALTO
      extension to retrieve AS path of network functions across
      different networks.

   o  [DRAFT-CONTEXT] proposes to extend cost information specified in
      [RFC7285] by providing several possible cost values for the same
      cost metric where each value depends on qualitative criteria as
      opposed to quantitative criteria such as time.

   o  [UNIF-REPR] makes a proposal to use mathematical programming
      constraint as a generic representation of multiple resources.

   o  [DRAFT-FCS] proposes a flexible flow query extension service to
      allow applications to specify query entities based on flexible
      matching conditions (e.g., TCP/IP 5-tuple) instead of IP addresses
      only.

6.  Novel Multi-domain Mechanisms and Abstractions

   This section presents novel mechanisms and abstractions based on
   recent research to allow the ALTO framework supporting the important
   multi-domain settings.

6.1.  Multi-domain Aggregation

   Figure 5 shows a generic aggregation framework of using ALTO in
   multi-domain use cases [BROKER-MDO][MERCATOR][BOXOPT].  It includes a
   multi-domain aggregation mechanism on top of the existing single
   domain architecture.  This new mechanism aggregates network
   information from ALTO servers in multiple networks to provide a
   single, consistent, updated, "virtual" domain abstraction.  Network
   maps, cost maps, unified entity properties, network capabilities, and
   routing path abstractions (path vectors) of individual networks are
   consistently integrated to provide the abstraction of a single,
   coherent network to the users, satisfying the multi-domain
   aggregation requirement.

6.1.1.  Workflow

   The basic workflow of this framework is as follows:

   o  A user (e.g., an application) submits a network service request to
      the Multi-domain Orchestrator (MdO).

   o  The MdO receives the network service and queries the aggregator to
      discover multi-resource network information (e.g., bandwidth,
      delay, and loss rate).

   o  The aggregator determines the member networks that the network
      service will traverse, and queries the ALTO server in each of
      these member networks to discover their resource information.

   o  Upon receiving the query from the aggregator, each ALTO server
      computes the resource abstraction of the corresponding member
      network, and send the network resource information to the
      aggregator.



Lachos, et al.          Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Multi-domain use cases with ALTO           July 2021


   o  The aggregator collects the resource abstractions from the
      relevant member networks, and derives this aggregated, unified
      resource information to the MdO.

   o  Based on the received information, the MdO determines the resource
      allocation for the network service, and sends a reservation
      request to the Domain Orchestrators (DOs).

6.2.  Multi-resource Abstraction

   Although the existing abstractions (network/cost map, unified
   property, and path vector) are already powerful, they cannot handle
   the multi-resource information requirement.  To this end, this
   document presents a recent, unified resource abstraction, based on
   mathematical programming constraints as a generic representation of
   the feasible resource capability of networks [MERCATOR], which users
   can consume via different resource management systems.

6.2.1.  Mathematical Programming Constraints: Basic Idea

   Consider a network as shown in Figure 6.  Assume that the bandwidth
   of every link is 100 Gbps.  An application (e.g., a large data
   analytics system) wants to reserve two circuits from S1 to D1 and S2
   to D2, respectively.  Assume the application is only interested in
   the bandwidth of both circuits.  The route of f1 (S1 -> D1) is S1 ->
   sw1 -> sw5 -> sw6 -> sw8 -> sw3 -> D1, and the route of f2 (S2 -> D2)
   is S2 -> sw2 -> sw5 -> sw6 -> sw8 -> sw4 -> D2.  The routes for the
   two circuits share common links l3 and l4, making it infeasible for
   both circuits to each reserve a 100 Gbps bandwidth.

                    Figure 6: Network Topology Example.

   The use of mathematical programming constraints is to generate a set
   of linear inequalities to provide a compact representation for
   different important properties of network resources (e.g., bandwidth,



Lachos, et al.          Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Multi-domain use cases with ALTO           July 2021


   delay, loss rate).  In the previous example, the following set of
   linear inequalities are generated:


                        f1 <= 100, for {l1, l2, l5, l6} ..... (le1)
                        f2 <= 100, for {l7, l8, l11, l12} ... (le2)
                   f1 + f2 <= 100, for {l3, l4} ............. (le3)


   which accurately captures the bandwidth sharing among two circuits'
   routes.

6.2.2.  Removing Redundant Linear Inequalities

   Taking a deeper look at the set of previous linear inequalities, one
   can conclude that inequalities of le1 and le2 can be implicitly
   derived from that of le3.  Thus, these inequalities are considered
   redundant.  The problem of finding redundant linear constraints has
   been widely studied [PAULRAJ10COMP].  Specifically, redundant linear
   inequalities are removed via a polynomial-time, optimal algorithm
   [KARMARKAR84].  In our example, the compressed set will only contain
   one inequality: f1 + f2 <= 100, for {l3, l4} (le3).

6.2.3.  From Single Domain to Multiple Domains

   To illustrate the basic aggregation abstraction from a single network
   to multiple networks, consider a collaboration network composed of
   three member networks, as shown in Figure 7.  A user wants to reserve
   bandwidth for three circuits, from source host S to destination hosts
   D1 , D2, and D3.

   The resource abstraction captures the constraints from all networks
   using the set of linear inequalities, as depicted in Figure 8.
   Specifically, the variables f1, f2, f3 represent the available
   bandwidth that can be reserved for (S, D1 ), (S, D2), and (S, D3),
   respectively.

      Figure 8: Resource abstraction for the reservation request from
                                 Figure 4.

   Each linear inequality represents a constraint on the reservable
   bandwidths over different shared resources by the three circuits.
   For example, the inequality le11 indicates that all three circuits
   share a common resource and that the sum of their bandwidths can not
   exceed 100 Gbps.

   After removing the redundant inequalities of each member network, the
   resource abstraction of each member network is:

   Figure 9: Resource abstraction of each member network after removing
                        the redundant inequalities.

   Although each domain may already conduct redundancy optimization,
   there can be cross-domain redundancy.  For example, the constraint

Internet-Draft      Multi-domain use cases with ALTO           July 2021


   le31 at member network 3 (f2 + f3 <= 10) can eliminate those at
   member network 1 (f1 + f2 + f3 <= 40) and member network 2 (f2 + f3
   <= 40).  Using a classic compression algorithm [TELGEN83], we can
   remove this cross domain redundancy.  Therefore, the compressed
   multi-domain set of linear inequalities will contain:


                             f1 <= 10,
                        f2 + f3 <= 10


   In implementation, to protect the privacy of different networks, an
   obfuscation mechanism developed in [MERCATOR] can be adopted to
   prevent the applications from associating the received resource
   abstractions with the corresponding member networks.  The key idea is
   to have each ALTO server obfuscate its own resource abstraction as a
   set of linear equations through a private random matrix of its own
   and a couple of random matrices shared with few other ALTO servers
   from other networks, and then send the obfuscated resource
   abstraction back to the application.  From the received resource
   abstractions, the application can retrieve the actual resource
   information across multiple networks, but cannot associate any linear
   inequality with its corresponding network.

6.3.  Multi-domain Programming Information Abstraction

   Multi-domain SDN requires multi-domain SDN resource and programming
   abstraction.  A novel multi-domain network programming framework is
   recently proposed to achieve programmable, end-to-end interdomain
   route control.  Specifically, in this framework, each autonomus
   system (AS) deploys an ALTO server to provide a programming
   abstraction.  Collectively, these ALTO servers provide the client a
   single, abstract, programmable network spanning multiple individual
   networks.  Unlike existing SDN abstractions (e.g., OpenFlow and P4),
   it includes a built-in layer to extract and learn the interactions of
   interdomain policies of individual networks (e.g., route selection
   preference), providing a unified abstraction.

   Specifically, given a destination IP prefix p specified by a client,
   each autonomous system (AS) exposes its routing information base
   (RIB), i.e., all available routes it has to reach p, and the
   corresponding price for the client to use each route, by deploying an
   ALTO server.  A client queries the available routes and the
   corresponding prices at different ASes.  With the retrieved
   information, it then itereatively selects the best route based on its
   internal objective function and budget, and interacts with different
   ASes to check if the selected route is policy compliant, i.e.,
   whether all ASes along this route will export the preceding segment

   to its upstream neighbor.  After finding the best policy compliant
   route, the client then interacts with ASes of the route in a backward
   order along the route to setup the AS path.  A blackbox based
   optimization algorithm has been developed to allow the client to
   swiftly find the best policy compliant route, and details can be find
   in [SDI].
