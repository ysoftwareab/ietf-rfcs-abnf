1. Introduction

   The full automation of the management and control of Service
   Providers transport networks (IP/MPLS, Optical and also Microwave)
   is key for achieving the new challenges coming now with 5G as well
   as with the increased demand in terms of business agility and
   mobility in a digital world. ACTN architecture, by abstracting the
   network complexity from Optical and IP/MPLS networks towards MDSC
   and then from MDSC towards OSS/BSS or Orchestration layer through
   the use of standard interfaces and data models, is allowing a wide
   range of transport connectivity services that can be requested by
   the upper layers fulfilling almost any kind of service level
   requirements from a network perspective (e.g. physical diversity,
   latency, bandwidth, topology etc.)

   Packet Optical Integration (POI) is an advanced use case of traffic
   engineering. In wide area networks, a packet network based on the
   Internet Protocol (IP) and possibly Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) is typically realized on top of an optical transport network
   that uses Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)(and
   optionally an Optical Transport Network (OTN)layer). In many
   existing network deployments, the packet and the optical networks
   are engineered and operated independently of each other. There are
   technical differences between the technologies (e.g., routers vs.
   optical switches) and the corresponding network engineering and
   planning methods (e.g., inter-domain peering optimization in IP vs.
   dealing with physical impairments in DWDM, or very different time
   scales). In addition, customers needs can be different between a
   packet and an optical network, and it is not uncommon to use
   different vendors in both domains. Last but not least, state-of-the-
   art packet and optical networks use sophisticated but complex
   technologies, and for a network engineer it may not be trivial to be

   a full expert in both areas. As a result, packet and optical
   networks are often operated in technical and organizational silos.

   This separation is inefficient for many reasons. Both capital
   expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) could be
   significantly reduced by better integrating the packet and the
   optical network. Multi-layer online topology insight can speed up
   troubleshooting (e.g., alarm correlation) and network operation
   (e.g., coordination of maintenance events), multi-layer offline
   topology inventory can improve service quality (e.g., detection of
   diversity constraint violations) and multi-layer traffic engineering
   can use the available network capacity more efficiently (e.g.,
   coordination of restoration). In addition, provisioning workflows
   can be simplified or automated as needed across layers (e.g, to
   achieve bandwidth on demand, or to perform maintenance events).

   ACTN framework enables this complete multi-layer and multi-vendor
   integration of packet and optical networks through MDSC and packet
   and optical PNCs.

   In this document, key scenarios for Packet Optical Integration (POI)
   are described from the packet service layer perspective. The
   objective is to explain the benefit and the impact for both the
   packet and the optical layer, and to identify the required
   coordination between both layers. Precise definitions of scenarios
   can help with achieving a common understanding across different
   disciplines. The focus of the scenarios are IP/MPLS networks
   operated as client of optical DWDM networks. The scenarios are
   ordered by increasing level of integration and complexity. For each
   multi-layer scenario, the document analyzes how to use the
   interfaces and data models of the ACTN architecture.

   Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps
   will help to better assess the feasibility of integration between IP
   and Optical DWDM domain (and optionally OTN layer), in an end-to-end
   multi-vendor service provisioning perspective.

2. Reference architecture and network scenario

   This document analyses a number of deployment scenarios for Packet
   and Optical Integration (POI) in which ACTN hierarchy is deployed to
   control a multi-layer and multi-domain network, with two Optical
   domains and two Packet domains, as shown in Figure 1:

                       Figure 1 - Reference Scenario

   The ACTN architecture, defined in [RFC8453], is used to control this
   multi-domain network where each Packet PNC (P-PNC) is responsible
   for controlling its IP domain, which can be either an Autonomous
   System (AS), [RFC1930], or an IGP area within the same operator
   network, and each Optical PNC (O-PNC) is responsible for controlling
   its Optical Domain.

   The routers between IP domains can be either AS Boundary Routers
   (ASBR) or Area Border Router (ABR): in this document the generic
   term Border Router (BR) is used to represent either an ASBR or a
   ABR.

   The MDSC is responsible for coordinating the whole multi-domain
   multi-layer (Packet and Optical) network. A specific standard
   interface (MPI) permits MDSC to interact with the different
   Provisioning Network Controller (O/P-PNCs).

   The MPI interface presents an abstracted topology to MDSC hiding
   technology-specific aspects of the network and hiding topology

   details depending on the policy chosen regarding the level of
   abstraction supported. The level of abstraction can be obtained
   based on P-PNC and O-PNC configuration parameters (e.g. provide the
   potential connectivity between any PE and any BR in an MPLS-TE
   network).

   In the network scenario of Figure 1, it is assumed that:

   o  The domain boundaries between the IP and Optical domains are
      congruent. In other words, one Optical domain supports
      connectivity between Routers in one and only one Packet Domain;

   o  Inter-domain links exist only between Packet domains (i.e.,
      between BR routers) and between Packet and Optical domains (i.e.,
      between routers and Optical NEs). In other words, there are no
      inter-domain links between Optical domains;

   o  The interfaces between the Routers and the Optical NEs are
      "Ethernet" physical interfaces;

   o  The interfaces between the Border Routers (BRs) are "Ethernet"
      physical interfaces.

   This version of the document assumes that the IP Link supported by
   the Optical network are always intra-AS (PE-BR, intra-domain BR-BR,
   PE-P, BR-P, or P-P) and that the BRs are co-located and connected by
   an IP Link supported by an Ethernet physical link.

   The possibility to setup inter-AS/inter-area IP Links (e.g.,
   inter-domain BR-BR or PE-PE), supported by Optical network, is for
   further study.

   Therefore, if inter-domain links between the Optical domains exist,
   they would be used to support multi-domain Optical services, which
   are outside the scope of this document.

   The Optical NEs within the optical domains can be ROADMs or OTN
   switches, with or without a ROADM.

   The MDSC in Figure 1 is responsible for multi-domain and multi-layer
   coordination across multiple Packet and Optical domains, as well as
   to provide L2/L3VPN services.

   Although the new technologies (e.g. QSFP-DD ZR 400G) are making
   convenient to fit the DWDM pluggable interfaces on the Routers, the
   deployment of those pluggable is not yet widely adopted by the
   operators. The reason is that most of operators are not yet ready to
   manage Packet and Transport networks in a unified single domain. As

   a consequence, this draft is not addressing the unified scenario.
   This matter will be described in a different draft.

   From an implementation perspective, the functions associated with
   MDSC and described in [RFC8453] may be grouped in different ways.

   1. Both the service- and network-related functions are collapsed into
     a single, monolithic implementation, dealing with the end customer
     service requests, received from the CMI (Customer MDSC Interface),
     and the adaptation to the relevant network models. Such case is
     represented in Figure 2 of [RFC8453]
   2. An implementation can choose to split the service-related and the
     network-related functions in different functional entities, as
     described in [RFC8309] and in section 4.2 of [RFC8453]. In this
     case, MDSC is decomposed into a top-level Service Orchestrator,
     interfacing the customer via the CMI, and into  a Network
     Orchestrator interfacing at the southbound with the PNCs. The
     interface between the Service Orchestrator and the Network
     Orchestrator is not specified in [RFC8453].
   3. Another implementation can choose to split the MDSC functions
     between an H-MDSC responsible for packet-optical multi-layer
     coordination, interfacing with one Optical L-MDSC, providing
     multi-domain coordination between the O-PNCs and one Packet
     L-MDSC, providing multi-domain coordination betweeh the P-PNCs
     (see for example Figure 9 of [RFC8453]).
   4. Another implementation can also choose to combine the MDSC and the
     P-PNC functions together.

   Please note that in current service provider's network deployments,
   at the North Bound of the MDSC, instead of a CNC, typically there is
   an OSS/Orchestration layer. In this case, the MDSC would implement
   only the Network Orchestration functions, as in [RFC8309] and
   described in point 2 above. In this case, the MDSC is dealing with
   the network services requests received from the OSS/Orchestration
   layer.

   [Editors'note:] Check for a better term to define the network
   services. It may be worthwhile defining what are the customer and
   network services.

   The OSS/Orchestration layer is a key part of the architecture
   framework for a service provider:

   o  to abstract (through MDSC and PNCs) the underlying transport
      network complexity to the Business Systems Support layer






Peruzzini et al.         Expires May 2, 2021                   [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   November 2020


   o  to coordinate NFV, Transport (e.g. IP, Optical and Microwave
      networks), Fixed Acess, Core and Radio domains enabling full
      automation of end-to-end services to the end customers.

   o  to enable catalogue-driven service provisioning from external
      applications (e.g. Customer Portal for Enterprise Business
      services) orchestrating the design and lifecycle management of
      these end-to-end transport connectivity services, consuming IP
      and/or Optical transport connectivity services upon request.

   The functionality of the OSS/Orchestration layer as well as the
   interface toward the MDSC are usually operator-specific and outside
   the scope of this draft. This document assumes that the
   OSS/Orchestrator requests MDSC to setup L2VPN/L3VPN services through
   mechanisms which are outside the scope of the draft.

   There are two main cases when MDSC coordination of underlying PNCs
   in POI context is initiated:

   o  Initiated by a request from the OSS/Orchestration layer to setup
      L2VPN/L3VPN services that requires multi-layer/multi-domain
      coordination.

   o  Initiated by the MDSC itself to perform multi-layer/multi-domain
      optimizations and/or maintenance works, beyond discovery (e.g.
      rerouting LSPs with their associated services when putting a
      resource, like a fibre, in maintenance mode during a maintenance
      window). Different to service fulfillment, the workflows then are
      not related at all to a service provisioning request being
      received from the OSS/Orchestration layer.

   Above two MDSC workflow cases are in the scope of this draft or in
   future versions.

2.1. L2/L3VPN Service Request in North Bound of MDSC

   As explained in section 2, the OSS/Orchestration layer can request
   the MDSC to setup of L2/L3VPN services (with or without TE
   requirements).

   Although the interface between the OSS/Orchestration layer is
   usually operator-specific, ideally it would be using a RESTCONF/YANG
   interface with more abstracted version of the MPI YANG data models
   used for network configuration (e.g. L3NM, L2NM).

   Figure 2 shows an example of a possible control flow between the
   OSS/Orchestration layer and the MDSC to instantiate L2/L3VPN

   o  The VN YANG model [VN], whose primary focus is the CMI, can also
      be used to provide VN Service configuration from a orchestrated
      connectivity service point of view, when the L2/L3VPN service has
      TE requirements. This model is not used to setup L2/L3VPN service
      with no TE requirements.

          end-points (VNAPs). It also provides the mappings between the

          bandwidth, latency, protection level, etc.) of VN member is
          expressed (i.e., via the TE-topology's connectivity matrix).

       o The model also provides VN-level preference information
          (e.g., VN member diversity) and VN-level admin-status and
          operational-status.

   o  The L2NM YANG model [L2NM], whose primary focus is the MPI, can
      also be used to provide L2VPN service configuration and site
      information, from a orchestrated connectivity service point of
      view.

   o  The L3NM YANG model [L3NM], whose primary focus is the MPI, can
      also be used to provide all L3VPN service configuration and site
      information, from a orchestrated connectivity service point of
      view.

   o  The TE & Service Mapping YANG model [TSM] provides TE-service
      mapping as well as site mapping.

       o TE-service mapping provides the mapping between a L2/L3VPN
          instance and the corresponding VN instances.

       o The TE-service mapping also provides the service mapping
          requirement type as to how each L2/L3VPN/VN instance is
          created with respect to the underlay TE tunnels (e.g.,
          whether they require a new and isolated set of TE underlay
          tunnels or not). See Section 2.2 for detailed discussion on
          the mapping requirement types.

       o Site mapping provides the site reference information across
          L2/L3VPN Site ID, VN Access Point ID, and the LTP of the
          access link.

2.2. Service and Network Orchestration

   From a functional standpoint, MDSC represented in Figure 2
   interfaces with the OSS/Orchestration layer and decouples L2/L3VPN
   service configuration functions from network configuration
   functions. Therefore in this document the MDSC performs the
   functions of the Network Orchestrator, as defined in [RFC 8309].

   One of the important MDSC functions is to identify which TE Tunnels
   should carry the L2/L3VPN traffic (e.g., from TE & Service Mapping
   configuration) and to relay this information to the P-PNCs, to
   ensure the PEs' forwarding tables (e.g., VRF) are properly
   populated, according to the TE binding requirement for the L2/L3VPN.

   TE binding requirement types [TSM] are:

   1. Hard Isolation with deterministic latency: The L2/L3VPN service
      requires a set of dedicated TE Tunnels providing deterministic
      latency performances and that cannot be not shared with other
      services, nor compete for bandwidth with other Tunnels.

   2. Hard Isolation: This is similar to the above case without
      deterministic latency requirements.

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   November 2020


   3. Soft Isolation: The L2/L3VPN service requires a set of dedicated
      MPLS-TE tunnels which cannot be shared with other services, but
      which could compete for bandwidth with other Tunnels.

   4. Sharing: The L2/L3VPN service allows sharing the MPLS-TE Tunnels
      supporting it with other services.

   For the first three types, there could be additional TE binding
   requirements with respect to different VN members of the same VN (on
   how different VN members, belonging to the same VN, can share or not
   network resources). For the first two cases, VN members can be
   hard-isolated, soft-isolated, or shared. For the third case, VN
   members can be soft-isolated or shared.

   In order to fulfill the the L2/L3VPN end-to-end TE requirements,
   including the TE binding requirements, the MDSC needs to perform
   multi-layer/multi-domain path computation to select the BRs, the
   intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels and the intra-domain Optical Tunnels.

   Depending on the knowledge that MDSC has of the topology and
   configuration of the underlying network domains, three models for
   performing path computation are possible:

   1. Summarization: MDSC has an abstracted TE topology view of all of
      the underlying domains, both packet and optical. MDSC does not
      have enough TE topology information to perform
      multi-layer/multi-domain path computation. Therefore MDSC
      delegates the P-PNCs and O-PNCs to perform a local path
      computation within their controlled domains and it uses the
      information returned by the P-PNCs and O-PNCs to compute the
      optimal multi-domain/multi-layer path.
      This model presents an issue to P-PNC, which does not have the
      capability of performing a single-domain/multi-layer path
      computation (that is, P-PNC does not have any possibility to
      retrieve the topology/configuration information from the Optical
      controller). A possible solution could be to include a CNC
      function in the P-PNC to request the MDSC multi-domain Optical
      path computation, as shown in Figure 10 of [RFC8453].

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   November 2020


   2. Partial summarization: MDSC has full visibility of the TE
      topology of the packet network domains and an abstracted view of
      the TE topology of the optical network domains.
      MDSC then has only the capability of performing multi-
      domain/single-layer path computation for the packet layer (the
      path can be computed optimally for the two packet domains).
      Therefore MDSC still needs to delegate the O-PNCs to perform
      local path computation within their respective domains and it
      uses the information received by the O-PNCs, together with its TE
      topology view of the multi-domain packet layer, to perform
      multi-layer/multi-domain path computation.
      The role of P-PNC is minimized, i.e. is limited to management.

   3. Full knowledge: MDSC has the complete and enough detailed view of
      the TE topology of all the network domains (both optical and
      packet). In such case MDSC has all the information needed to
      perform multi-domain/multi-layer path computation, without
      relying on PNCs.
      This model may present, as a potential drawback, scalability
      issues and, as discussed in section 2.2. of [PATH-COMPUTE],
      performing path computation for optical networks in the MDSC is
      quite challenging because the optimal paths depend also on
      vendor-specific optical attributes (which may be different in the
      two domains if they are provided by different vendors).

   The current version of this draft assumes that MDSC supports at
   least model #2 (Partial summarization).

   [Note: check with opeerators for some references on real deployment]

2.2.1. Hard Isolation

   For example, when "Hard Isolation with or w/o deterministic latency"
   TE binding requirement is applied for a L2/L3VPN, new Optical
   Tunnels need to be setup to support dedicated IP Links between PEs
   and BRs.

   The MDSC needs to identify the set of IP/MPLS domains and their BRs.
   This requires the MDSC to request each O-PNC to compute the
   intra-domain optical paths between each PEs/BRs pairs.

   When requesting optical path computation to the O-PNC, the MDSC
   needs to take into account the inter-layer peering points, such as
   the interconnections between the PE/BR nodes and the edge Optical
   nodes (e.g., using the inter-layer lock or the transitional link
   information, defined in [RFC8795]).





Peruzzini et al.         Expires May 2, 2021                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   November 2020


   When the optimal multi-layer/multi-domain path has been computed,
   the MDSC requests each O-PNC to setup the selected Optical Tunnels
   and P-PNC to setup the intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels, over the
   selected Optical Tunnels. MDSC also properly configures its BGP
   speakers and PE/BR forwarding tables to ensure that the VPN traffic
   is properly forwarded.

2.2.2. Shared Tunnel Selection

   In case of shared tunnel selection, the MDSC needs to check if there
   is multi-domain path which can support the L2/L3VPN end-to-end TE
   service requirements (e.g., bandwidth, latency, etc.) using existing
   intra-domain MPLS-TE tunnels.

   If such a path is found, the MDSC selects the optimal path from the
   candidate pool and request each P-PNC to setup the L2/L3VPN service
   using the selected intra-domain MPLS-TE tunnel, between PE/BR nodes.

   Otherwise, the MDSC should detect if the multi-domain path can be
   setup using existing intra-domain MPLS-TE tunnels with modifications
   (e.g., increasing the tunnel bandwidth) or setting up new intra-
   domain MPLS-TE tunnel(s).

   The modification of an existing MPLS-TE Tunnel as well as the setup
   of a new MPLS-TE Tunnel may also require multi-layer coordination
   e.g., in case the available bandwidth of underlying Optical Tunnels
   is not sufficient. Based on multi-domain/multi-layer path
   computation, the MDSC can decide for example to modify the bandwidth
   of an existing Optical Tunnel (e.g., ODUflex bandwidth increase) or
   to setup new Optical Tunnels to be used as additional LAG members of
   an existing IP Link or as new IP Links to re-route the MPLS-TE
   Tunnel.

   In all the cases, the labels used by the end-to-end tunnel are
   distributed in the PE and BR nodes by BGP. The MDSC is responsible
   to configure the BGP speakeers in each P-PNC, if needed.

2.3. IP/MPLS Domain Controller and NE Functions

   IP/MPLS networks are assumed to have multiple domains, where each
   domain, corresponding to either an IGP area or an Autonomous System
   (AS) within the same operator network, is controlled by an IP/MPLS
   domain controller (P-PNC).

   Among the functions of the P-PNC, there are the setup or
   modification of the intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels, between PEs and
   BRs, and the configuration of the VPN services, such as the VRF in
   the PE nodes, as shown in Figure 3:

             Figure 3 IP/MPLS Domain Controller & NE Functions

   It is assumed that BGP is running in the inter-domain IP/MPLS
   networks for L2/L3VPN and that the P-PNC controller is also
   responsible for configuring the BGP speakers within its control
   domain, if necessary.

   The BGP would be responsible for the label distribution of the
   end-to-end tunnel on PE and BR nodes. The MDSC is responsible for
   the selection of the BRs and of the intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels
   between PE/BR nodes.

   If new MPLS-TE Tunnels are needed or mofications (e.g., bandwidth
   ingrease) to existing MPLS_TE Tunnels are needed, as outlined in
   section 2.2, the MDSC would request their setup or modifications to
   the P-PNCs (step 1 in Figure 3). Then the MDSC would request the
   P-PNC to configure the VPN, including the selection of the
   intra-domain TE Tunnel (step 2 in Figure 3).

   The P-PNC should configure, using mechanisms outside the scope of
   this document, the ingress PE forwarding table, e.g., the VRF, to
   forward the VPN traffic, received from the CE, with the following
   three labels:

   o  VPN label: assigned by the egress PE and distributed by BGP;

   o  end-to-end LSP label: assigned by the egress BR, selected by the
      MDSC, and distributed by BGP;

   o  MPLS-TE tunnel label, assigned by the next hop P node of the
      tunnel selected by the MDSC and distributed by mechanism internal
      to the IP/MPLS domain (e.g., RSVP-TE).

2.4. Optical Domain Controller and NE Functions

   Optical network provides the underlay connectivity services to
   IP/MPLS networks. The coordination of Packet/Optical multi-layer is
   done by the MDSC, as shown in Figure 1.

   The O-PNC is responsible to:

   o  provide to the MDSC an abstract TE topology view of its
      underlying optical network resources;

   o  perform single-domain local path computation, when requested by
      the MDSC;

   o  perform Optical Tunnel setup, when requested by the MDSC.

   The mechanisms used by O-PNC to perform intra-domain topology
   discovery and path setup are usually vendor-speicific and outside
   the scope of this document.

   Depending on the type of optical network, TE topology abstraction,
   path compution and path setup can be single-layer (either OTN or
   WDM) or multi-layer OTN/WDM. In the latter case, the multi-layer
   coordination between the OTN and WDM layers is performed by the
   O-PNC.

3. Interface protocols and YANG data models for the MPIs

   This section describes general assumptions which are applicable at
   all the MPI interfaces, between each PNC (Optical or Packet) and the
   MDSC, and also to all the scenarios discussed in this document.

3.1. RESTCONF protocol at the MPIs

   The RESTCONF protocol, as defined in [RFC8040], using the JSON
   representation, defined in [RFC7951], is assumed to be used at these
   interfaces. Extensions to RESTCONF, as defined in [RFC8527], to be
   compliant with Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   defined in [RFC8342], are assumed to be used as well at these MPI
   interfaces and also at CMI interfaces.

3.2. YANG data models at the MPIs

   The data models used on these interfaces are assumed to use the YANG
   1.1 Data Modeling Language, as defined in [RFC7950].

3.2.1. Common YANG data models at the MPIs

   As required in [RFC8040], the "ietf-yang-library" YANG module
   defined in [RFC8525] is used to allow the MDSC to discover the set
   of YANG modules supported by each PNC at its MPI.

   Both Optical and Packet PNCs use the following common topology YANG
   models at the MPI to report their abstract topologies:

   o  The Base Network Model, defined in the "ietf-network" YANG module
      of [RFC8345]

   o  The Base Network Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-network-
      topology" YANG module of [RFC8345], which augments the Base
      Network Model

   o  The TE Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-te-topology" YANG
      module of [RFC8795], which augments the Base Network Topology
      Model with TE specific information.

   These common YANG models are generic and augmented by technology-
   specific YANG modules as described in the following sections.

   Both Optical and Packet PNCs must use the following common
   notifications YANG models at the MPI so that any network changes can
   be reported almost in real-time to MDSC by the PNCs:

   o  Dynamic Subscription to YANG Events and Datastores over RESTCONF
      as defined in [RFC8650]

   o  Subscription to YANG Notifications for Datastores updates as
      defined in [RFC8641]

   PNCs and MDSCs must be compliant with subscription requirements as
   stated in [RFC7923].

3.2.2. YANG models at the Optical MPIs

   The Optical PNC also uses at least the following technology-specific
   topology YANG models, providing WDM and Ethernet technology-specific
   augmentations of the generic TE Topology Model:

   o  The WSON Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-wson-topology" YANG
      modules of [WSON-TOPO], or the Flexi-grid Topology Model, defined
      in the "ietf-flexi-grid-topology" YANG module of [Flexi-TOPO].

   o  Optionally, when the OTN layer is used, the OTN Topology Model,
      as defined in the "ietf-otn-topology" YANG module of [OTN-TOPO].

   o  The Ethernet Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-eth-te-
      topology" YANG module of [CLIENT-TOPO].

   o  Optionally, when the OTN layer is used, the network data model
      for L1 OTN services (e.g. an Ethernet transparent service) as
      defined in "ietf-trans-client-service" YANG module of draft-ietf-
      ccamp-client-signal-yang [CLIENT-SIGNAL].

   o  The WSON Topology Model or, alternatively, the Flexi-grid
      Topology model is used to report the DWDM network topology (e.g.,
      ROADMs and links) depending on whether the DWDM optical network
      is based on fixed grid or flexible-grid.

   The Ethernet Topology is used to report the access links between the
   IP routers and the edge ROADMs.

   The optical PNC uses at least the following YANG models:

   o  The TE Tunnel Model, defined in the "ietf-te" YANG module of
      [TE-TUNNEL]

   o  The WSON Tunnel Model, defined in the "ietf-wson-tunnel" YANG
      modules of [WSON-TUNNEL], or the Flexi-grid Media Channel Model,
      defined in the "ietf-flexi-grid-media-channel" YANG module of
      [Flexi-MC]

   o  Optionally, when the OTN layer is used, the OTN Tunnel Model,
      defined in the "ietf-otn-tunnel" YANG module of [OTN-TUNNEL].

   o  The Ethernet Client Signal Model, defined in the "ietf-eth-tran-
      service" YANG module of [CLIENT-SIGNAL].

   The TE Tunnel model is generic and augmented by technology-specific
   models such as the WSON Tunnel Model and the Flexi-grid Media
   Channel Model.

   The WSON Tunnel Model or, alternatively, the Flexi-grid Media
   Channel Model are used to setup connectivity within the DWDM network
   depending on whether the DWDM optical network is based on fixed grid
   or flexible-grid.

   The Ethernet Client Signal Model is used to configure the steering
   of the Ethernet client traffic between Ethernet access links and TE
   Tunnels, which in this case could be either WSON Tunnels or
   Flexi-Grid Media Channels. This model is generic and applies to any
   technology-specific TE Tunnel: technology-specific attributes are
   provided by the technology-specific models which augment the generic
   TE-Tunnel Model.

3.2.3. YANG data models at the Packet MPIs

   The Packet PNC also uses at least the following technology-specific
   topology YANG models, providing IP and Ethernet technology-specific
   augmentations of the generic Topology Models described in section
   3.2.1:

   o  The L3 Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-l3-unicast-topology"
      YANG modules of [RFC8346], which augments the Base Network
      Topology Model

   o  The L3 specific data model including extended TE attributes (e.g.
      performance derived metrics like latency), defined in "ietf-l3-
      te-topology" and in "ietf-te-topology-packet" in draft-ietf-teas-
      l3-te-topo [L3-TE-TOPO]

   o  The Ethernet Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-eth-te-
      topology" YANG module of [CLIENT-TOPO], which augments the TE
      Topology Model

   The Ethernet Topology Model is used to report the access links
   between the IP routers and the edge ROADMs as well as the
   inter-domain links between ASBRs, while the L3 Topology Model is
   used to report the IP network topology (e.g., IP routers and links).





   o  The User Network Interface (UNI) Topology Model, being defined in
      the "ietf-uni-topology" module of the draft-ogondio-opsawg-uni-
      topology [UNI-TOPO] which augment "ietf-network" module defined
      in [RFC8345] adding service attachment points to the nodes to
      which L2VPN/L3VPN IP/MPLS services can be attached.

   o  L3VPN network data model defined in "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module of
      draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm [L3NM] used for non-ACTN MPI for
      L3VPN service provisioning

   o  L2VPN network data model defined in "ietf-l2vpn-ntw" module of
      draft-ietf-barguil-opsawg-l2sm-l2nm [L2NM] used for non-ACTN MPI
      for L2VPN service provisioning

   [Editor's note:] Add YANG models used for tunnel and service
   configuration.

4. Multi-layer and multi-domain services scenarios

   Multi-layer and multi-domain scenarios, based on reference network
   described in section 2, and very relevant for Service Providers, are
   described in the next sections. For each scenario existing IETF
   protocols and data models are identified with particular focus on
   the MPI in the ACTN architecture. Non ACTN IETF data models required
   for L2/L3VPN service provisioning between MDSC and IP PNCs are also
   identified.

4.1. Scenario 1: network and service topology discovery

   In this scenario, the MSDC needs to discover through the underlying
   PNCs, the network topology, at both WDM and IP layers, in terms of
   nodes (NEs) and links, including inter AS domain links as well as
   cross-layer links but also in terms of tunnels (MPLS or SR paths in
   IP layer and OCh and optionally ODUk tunnels in optical layer).MDSC
   discovers also the IP/MPLS transport services (L2VPN/L3VPN)
   deployed, both intra-domain and inter-domain wise.

   Each PNC provides to the MDSC an abstracted or full topology view of
   the WDM or the IP topology of the domain it controls. This topology
   can be abstracted in the sense that some detailed NE information is
   hidden at the MPI, and all or some of the NEs and related physical
   links are exposed as abstract nodes and logical (virtual) links,
   depending on the level of abstraction the user requires. This
   information is key to understand both the inter-AS domain links
   (seen by each controller as UNI interfaces but as I-NNI interfaces
   by the MDSC) as well as the cross-layer mapping between IP and WDM
   layer.

   The MDSC also maintains an up-to-date network database of both IP
   and WDM layers (and optionally OTN layer) through the use of IETF
   notifications through MPI with the PNCs when any topology change
   occurs. It should be possible also to correlate information coming

   used by a specific IP service on the WDM equipment)

   In particular, For the cross-layer links it is key for MDSC to be
   able to correlate automatically the information from the PNC network
   databases about the physical ports from the routers (single link or
   bundle links for LAG) to client ports in the ROADM.

  It should be possible at MDSC level to easily correlate WDM and IP
  layers alarms to speed-up troubleshooting

  Alarms and event notifications are required between MDSC and PNCs so
  that any network changes are reported almost in real-time to the MDSC
  (e.g. NE or link failure, MPLS tunnel switched from main to backup
  path etc.). As specified in [RFC7923] MDSC must be able to subscribe
  to specific objects from PNC YANG datastores for notifications.

4.1.1. Inter-domain link discovery

   In the reference network of Figure 1, there are two types of
   inter-domain links:

   o  Links between two IP domains (ASes)

   o  Links between an IP router and a ROADM

   Both types of links are Ethernet physical links.

   The inter-domain link information is reported to the MDSC by the two
   adjacent PNCs, controlling the two ends of the inter-domain link.
   The MDSC needs to understa how to merge the these inter-domain
   Ethernet links together.

   This document considers the following two options for discovering
   inter-domain links:

   1. Static configuration

   2. LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB] automatic discovery

   Other options are possible but not described in this document.

   The MDSC can understand how to merge these inter-domain links
   together using the plug-id attribute defined in the TE Topology
   Model [RFC8795], as described in as described in section 4.3 of
   [RFC8795].

   A more detailed description of how the plug-id can be used to
   discover inter-domain link is also provided in section 5.1.4 of
   [TNBI].

   Both types of inter-domain links are discovered using the plug-id
   attributes reported in the Ethernet Topologies exposed by the two
   adjacent PNCs. The MDSC can also discover an inter-domain IP
   link/adjacency between the two IP LTPs, reported in the IP
   Topologies exposed by the two adjacent P-PNCs, supported by the two
   ETH LTPs of an Ethernet Link discovered between these two P-PNCs.

   The static configuration requires an administrative burden to
   configure network-wide unique identifiers: it is therefore more
   viable for inter-AS links. For the links between the IP routers and
   the Optical NEs, the automatic discovery solution based on LLDP
   snooping is preferable when LLDP snooping is supported by the
   Optical NEs.

   As outlined in [TNBI], the encoding of the plug-id namespace as well
   as of the LLDP information within the plug-id value is
   implementation specific and needs to be consistent across all the
   PNCs.

4.1.2. IP Link Setup Procedure

   The MDSC requires the O-PNC to setup a WDM Tunnel (either a WSON
   Tunnel or a Flexi grid Tunnel) within the DWDM network between the
   two Optical Transponders (OTs) associated with the two access links.

   The Optical Transponders are reported by the O-PNC as Trail
   Termination Points (TTPs), defined in [TE TOPO], within the WDM
   Topology. The association between the Ethernet access link and the
   WDM TTP is reported by the Inter Layer Lock (ILL) identifiers,
   defined in [TE TOPO], reported by the O PNC within the Ethernet
   Topology and WDM Topology.

   The MDSC also requires the O-PNC to steer the Ethernet client
   traffic between the two access Ethernet Links over the WDM Tunnel.

   After the WDM Tunnel has been setup and the client traffic steering
   configured, the two IP routers can exchange Ethernet packets between
   themselves, including LLDP messages.

   If LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB] is used between the two routers, the P PNC
   can automatically discover the IP Link being set up by the MDSC. The
   IP LTPs terminating this IP Link are supported by the ETH LTPs
   terminating the two access links.

   Otherwise, the MDSC needs to require the P PNC to configure an IP
   Link between the two routers: the MDSC also configures the two ETH
   LTPs which support the two IP LTPs terminating this IP Link.

4.2. L2VPN/L3VPN establishment

   To be added

   [Editor's Note] What mechanism would convey on the interface to the
   IP/MPLS domain controllers as well as on the SBI (between IP/MPLS
   domain controllers and IP/MPLS PE routers) the TE binding policy
   dynamically for the L3VPN? Typically, VRF is the function of the
   device that participate MP-BGP in MPLS VPN. With current MP-BGP
   implementation in MPLS VPN, the VRF's BGP next hop is the
   destination PE and the mapping to a tunnel (either an LDP or a BGP
   tunnel) toward the destination PE is done by automatically without
   any configuration. It is to be determined the impact on the PE VRF
   operation when the tunnel is an optical bypass tunnel which does not
   participate either LDP or BGP.

   New text to answer the yellow part:

   The MDSC Network-related function will then coordinate with the PNCs
   involved in the process to provide the provisioning information
   through ACTN MDSC to PNC (MPI) interface. The relevant data models
   used at the MPI may be in the form of L3NM, L2NM or others and are
   exchanged through MPI API calls. Through this process MDSC Network-
   related functions provide the configuration information to realize a
   VPN service to PNCs. For example, this process will inform PNCs on
   what PE routers compose a L3VPN, the topology requested, the VPN
   attributes, etc.

   At the end of the process PNCs will deliver the actual configuration
   to the devices (either physical or virtual), through the ACTN
   Southbound Interface (SBI). In this case the configuration policies
   may be exchanged using a Netconf session delivering configuration
   commands associated to device-specific data models (e.g. BGP[], QOS
   [], etc.).

   Having the topology information of the network domains under their
   control, PNCs will deliver all the information necessary to create,
   update, optimize or delete the tunnels connecting the PE nodes as
   requested by the VPN instantiation.

   Telemetry data, such as the collection of lower-layer networking
   health and consideration of network and service performance from POI
   domain controllers, may be required. These requirements and
   capabilities will be discussed in future versions of this document.

7. IANA Considerations

Appendix A. Multi-layer and multi-domain resiliency

A.1.  Maintenance Window

   Before planned maintenance operation on DWDM network takes place, IP
   traffic should be moved hitless to another link.

   MDSC must reroute IP traffic before the events takes place. It
   should be possible to lock IP traffic to the protection route until
   the maintenance event is finished, unless a fault occurs on such
   path.

A.2.  Router port failure

   The focus is on client-side protection scheme between IP router and
   reconfigurable ROADM. Scenario here is to define only one port in
   the routers and in the ROADM muxponder board at both ends as back-up
   ports to recover any other port failure on client-side of the ROADM
   (either on router port side or on muxponder side or on the link
   between them). When client-side port failure occurs, alarms are
   raised to MDSC by IP-PNC and O-PNC (port status down, LOS etc.).
   MDSC checks with OP-PNC(s) that there is no optical failure in the
   optical layer.

   There can be two cases here:

   a) LAG was defined between the two end routers. MDSC, after checking
      that optical layer is fine between the two end ROADMs, triggers
      the ROADM configuration so that the router back-up port with its
      associated muxponder port can reuse the OCh that was already in
      use previously by the failed router port and adds the new link to
      the LAG on the failure side.

      While the ROADM reconfiguration takes place, IP/MPLS traffic is
      using the reduced bandwidth of the IP link bundle, discarding
      lower priority traffic if required. Once backup port has been
      reconfigured to reuse the existing OCh and new link has been
      added to the LAG then original Bandwidth is recovered between the
      end routers.

      Note: in this LAG scenario let assume that BFD is running at LAG
      level so that there is nothing triggered at MPLS level when one
      of the link member of the LAG fails.

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   November 2020


   b) If there is no LAG then the scenario is not clear since a router
      port failure would automatically trigger (through BFD failure)
      first a sub-50ms protection at MPLS level :FRR (MPLS RSVP-TE
      case) or TI-LFA (MPLS based SR-TE case) through a protection
      port. At the same time MDSC, after checking that optical network
      connection is still fine, would trigger the reconfiguration of
      the back-up port of the router and of the ROADM muxponder to re-
      use the same OCh as the one used originally for the failed router
      port. Once everything has been correctly configured, MDSC Global
      PCE could suggest to the operator to trigger a possible re-
      optimisation of the back-up MPLS path to go back to the  MPLS
      primary path through the back-up port of the router and the
      original OCh if overall cost, latency etc. is improved. However,
      in this scenario, there is a need for protection port PLUS back-
      up port in the router which does not lead to clear port savings.
