<h1><br />Problem Statement: DNS Resolution of Aliased Names<br />draft-yao-dnsext-identical-resolution-02.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises from the desire to treat a set or group of names 
as "aliases" of each other, "bundled," "variants," or "the same," which is problematic in terms of corresponding 
behavior for DNS labels. 

</p>
<p>
With the emergence of internationalized domain names, among other potential use cases, two or more names 
that users will regard as having identical meaning will sometimes require corresponding behavior in the DNS. It's 
not clear how to accommodate these requirements for behavior of such names in DNS resolution; in particular,
it's not clear when they are best accommodated in registry practices for generating names for lookup in the DNS, 
existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, or some set of protocol elements or behavior not yet defined.
This document attempts to describe some of these cases and the behavior of some of the possible solutions 
discussed to date.

Introduction</h3>

<p>

As the Internet and the DNS have evolved beyond their original realms of use, a set of needs and
expectations has appeared about how DNS labels behave that is informed significantly by common human 
assumptions about
how "names" or "words" work. One aspect of this is the notion or expectation that multiple sets of names
may be similar to a human user, and expected to behave "the same" or as "aliases" of one another.
The DNS was designed with the implicit expectation that names would be based on ASCII characters,
and the "similarity" or "sameness" property doesn't seem to arise terribly often in the names people originally
wanted to use in the DNS; thus the requirements of  
identical resolution of "aliased" or "bundled" names hasn't figured prominently as an attribute that needed
to be accommodated in the generation or lookup of DNS names.
However, with the standardization of internationalized domain names protocols (ref: IDNA and IDNAbis), 
more and more internationalized domain name labels <a class='info' href='#RFC3490'>[RFC3490]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Faltstrom, P., Hoffman, P., and A. Costello, &ldquo;Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> are appearing in DNS zones.
In some cases, these labels
<a class='info' href='#RFC3743'>[RFC3743]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Konishi, K., Huang, K., Qian, H., and Y. Ko, &ldquo;Joint Engineering Team (JET) Guidelines for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Registration and Administration for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> are accompanied by the expectation that they are "equivalent" or should behave "the
same," often because these labels are derived from names or strings that users consider "the same" in some 
languages. Accordingly, Internet users hope for such labels to behave in DNS contexts as they expect the
corresponding human constructs to behave. 

</p>
<p>
The general issues of what "the same" means, or of defining "variants" in human scripts as codified in 
Unicode (or anywhere else) are well outside the scope of the DNS or the expertise of most of the people who
work on it. They are matters for philosophers and applications developers, respectively. However, to the extent
that these issues can be specified as involving the resolution of names in the DNS, it's reasonable to describe
those expectations and attempt to accomodate them.

</p>
<p>
There is some existing technology defined in the DNS for behavior that can be described as one name behaving
"the same" as another. For a single node in the DNS tree, CNAME can be used to map one name as an "alias" to 
another, "canonical" name. If there is a need to map a subtree of the DNS-- a zone, or a domain and its
subdomains-- to another domain, DNAME has been defined to allow this behavior. However, there is no way currently
defined to do both, as CNAME is required to be the record at its node in the tree. 
Behavior that combines their characteristics is not currently defined in the DNS.

</p>
<p>
If existing protocol does not meet the zone administrator's need to be able to treat one label, name, or zone as
"the same" as another, there are also administrative mechanisms available for manipulating databases underlying
the generation and resolution of DNS names. Registry operators have many mechanisms for working around DNS 
protocol in order to get behavior they want for names in DNS zones, and management of "aliases" is no exception.
However, it is not clear how much of the user and operator requirements for "aliases" can be met by mechanisms
for provisioning DNS zones, at acceptable cost. Concerns have been raised about this approach particularly at 
large scales.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
What this document does</h3>

<p>
Attempts to think about "aliases" or similar concepts as applied to the DNS have been difficult, both because
use cases have been unclear and because terminology for describing and distinguishing them has not been 
readily available. This document attempts to provide both brief descriptions of identified use cases, and a
rough organization for how to think about behavior in the DNS that might correspond to the requirements derived
from them as a way of evaluating proposed solutions. This includes existing and additional possible solutions.

</p>
<p>
As a departure point, we attempt to be rigorous about distinguishing DNS "labels" from "words" (a human construct)
and "strings" (which we use here as machine-readable constructs that nonetheless may not conform to DNS label
constraints, such as IDNA U-labels).

</p>
<p> We also review existing constructs (CNAME, DNAME) and proposed new ones ("BNAME," "zone clones").

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
What this document does not do</h3>

<p>
This document makes no attempt to solve or even describe "translation" of one name into another in the DNS,
which is likely to be impossible. "Translation" in general, or even the particular problem of determining when
or why two DNS labels (or even FQDNs) should be considered "the same", are simply not in scope for the DNS
protocol. We pre-suppose those decisions are made elsewhere and that the DNS needs to deliver behavior in
conformance with that external decision.

</p>
<p>
Accordingly, this document makes no comment on policy regarding when two names are "the same," what restrictions
should be placed on their generation or use outside those imposed by the DNS protocol, or the ability of one
approach over another to instantiate what a given user regards as "the same" for a language, script, culture,
or community.

Terminology</h3>

<p>
All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in
the documents <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC1035'>[RFC1035]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - implementation and specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>,

</p>
<p>
We also note that there is a wide variety of terminology in use to describe the issues we attempt to treat in this
document, and no consensus on which apply under what conditions. Terms for "a set of domain names that somehow
need to be treated as similar" include "bundle," "variants," or "clones". As uniformity of terms is one of the
goals of any work on this topic in the DNS, we try not to add to the confusion in the problem statement but can't
claim to have finalized a recommendation in early versions of this document.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Problem Statement</h3>

<p> 
From the point of view of the DNS, a number of attributes suggest themselves as important dimensions for 
evaluating what "the same" might mean.

</p>
<p>
One question is exactly what it is that's to be defined as "the same"? Are the end results to be identical, and
if so from what perspective: that of the recursive resolver? The application? The human consumer of content?
Is it enough that lookups on the
FQDN portion of an email address result in the same A or AAAA records, or does some intermediate mapping need to
be maintained between MX records in the resolution chain? What about the FQDN portion of a URL handed back to 
an application, or in resolution processes that include multiple lookups of records that may include FQDNs? Do
there need to be general rules specified for the handling of FQDNs in RDATA of present and future RRtypes?

</p>
<p>
Another question is the behavior of multiple names with respect to one another: is it enough to define one as 
"canonical" or "preferred," with the others considered as "variants" that are transformed to the "preferred"
form? Or is there a real need for multiple names to be "equivalent", interchangeable, with none considered 
"preferred" over the others? (We note here that no requirement for complete interchangeability or identity has
been articulated, except anecdotally, and such equivalence would be extremely difficult to define in the DNS.)

</p>
<p>
In addition, the tree structure of the DNS requires that we consider the behavior of "identical" names across 
multiple zones in the hierarchy. Are mappings to be maintained in names more than a level, or two, deep? If so,
with what characteristics, and what characteristics are required for scalability?

</p>
<p> A further question arises with respect to how applications should interact with alias-specific DNS behavior.
A basic requirement would seem to be "First, do no harm," or in other words, any extensions to DNS protocol in
support of the desired "alias" behavior should not interfere with applications that expect to do such interpretation
on their own. This concern is based in the expectation that DNS is simple and predictable, operating strictly as

Registration of Domain Name Variants</h3>

<p>
The introduction of IDN has provided a forcing function for defining how "variants" might behave as DNS names.
It's generally conceded that recognition and careful management of cases where multiple names are associated
together as "variants" in the expectation or preference of users are important; without such management of 
grouped domain names, security risks may be increased and the quality of user experience may be compromised.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Identical DNS Resolution for Bundled DNS Names</h3>

<p>
To some extent, the desired behavior can be described: "identical DNS resolution" means that the process of 
resolving two domain names will end with the same result, in most cases the same IP address.
In the history of DNS protocol development, there have been two attempts to specify such "identical resolution"
behavior:CNAME<a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> which maps or redirects
itself, and DNAME<a class='info' href='#RFC2672'>[RFC2672]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crawford, M., &ldquo;Non-Terminal DNS Name Redirection,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> which maps or redirects its descendants. In the case of bundles or
groups of names, however, some operators have asserted they need
identical DNS resolution at all levels' domain names, including the domain name itself and its descendants.
As alluded to above, registries are left with ad hoc provisioning and database management mechanisms for managing
variant names, with some help from existing DNS protocol mechanisms for mapping labels or FQDNs to each other. 
However, some are finding the existing mechanisms to have unsatisfactory limitations; they are seeking more
guidance on the use of existing mechanisms, and perhaps the addition of new ones in the DNS protocol.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Character Variants</h3>

<p>
Many defined scripts as used in many different languages have "character variants" included. There is 
no uniform definition of variants, and in fact their characteristics differ widely, but it's possible to define
some.
For example, the definition of variant characters in the JET Guidelines <a class='info' href='#RFC3743'>[RFC3743]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Konishi, K., Huang, K., Qian, H., and Y. Ko, &ldquo;Joint Engineering Team (JET) Guidelines for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Registration and Administration for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, intended
for use with the CJK language/script communities, is roughly this:
One conceptual character can be identified with several different Code Points in character sets for computer use.
In UNICODE definitions of some scripts, including Han (chinese), some characters can be identified as 
"compatibility variants" of another character, which usually implies that the first can be remapped to the 
second without the loss of any meaning. In this document, variant characters are two or more characters that may
be similar in appearance or identical in meaning (similarity in appearance is not required by the definition
but often occurs).

</p>
<p>
With the introduction of IDNs in the DNS, perhaps most prominently in the root zone, decisions about how to deal 
with IDN variants is a significant challenge ahead of us. We describe here a couple of examples, Chinese and Greek;
[STW: ....and additional cases (Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.)should be described in future versions by experts in those 
scripts and languages].

</p>
<a name="anchor8"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.2.3.1"></a><h3>2.3.1.&nbsp;
An example: Simplified and Traditional Chinese</h3>

<p>
For example, if the IDN TLD "China"(U+4E2D U+56FD) and its variant (U+4E2D U+570B) are put into the
root, the first one (U+4E2D U+56FD) can be considered the "original" IDN TLD
and the second one (U+4E2D U+570B) can be considered the IDN TLD "variant".
Ideally, it should be possible to treat the original IDN TLD and its IDN TLD variant as
"identical" for purposes of DNS resolution, in a way similar to the case mapping most DNS users take for
granted, in which the uppercase "A" is the variant of lowercase "a". For example, the string ".COM" can be 
considered a variant of 
".com", and the corresponding DNS labels are treated as identical. However, for the historical reasons already
discussed, and technical reasons having to do with the underpinnings of the IDNAbis protocol (ref: IDNAbis
rationale), there's no generalization of the "case" mapping available for situations where it might be useful
for IDNs. In addition, it's perilous because DNS rules around "case insensitivity" and "case preservation" are
not intuitively consistent. 
</p>
<p> At this writing, four Chinese script IDN TLDs are in the root, including two pairs comprising a Traditional
Chinese name and its Simplified counterpart, which should allow future versions of this document to include
those operators' experience of managing maintenance of those names as "the same."

<a name="rfc.section.2.3.2"></a><h3>2.3.2.&nbsp;
An example: Greek</h3>

<p>
In Greek, almost every word has the "tonos" accent sign, but where it is placed (on which character) can vary. 
Further, some words end in a final sigma, which is represented differently to sigma appearing elsewhere in the 
word. If a registry wishes to be able to enforce the association among all of the domain
names that correspond to a "word" in Greek, with all its possible Unicode strings, some mechanism must be used
to enumerate the "variant" names and tie them together. This makes sense from the human factors perspective,
as depending on how the user types something, results may include a different domain to what was expected, 
although the user may have the firm belief that "the same word" was input in multiple cases.

</p>
<p>
As an example, the domain names "xn--0xadhj4a.gr" and "xn--0xaafjl.gr" appear to a native speaker/reader of 
Greek to represent "the same word," in a sense very much like the case insensitivity that native users of 
Latin script take for granted in the DNS.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Possible Solutions</h3>

<p>
Currently, there are several possible mechanisms to support identical DNS resolution of "bundled" or "variant"
names as "aliases" in the DNS. Existing mechanisms in the DNS include CNAME and DNAME. In addition, as described 
briefly above, registry 
operators have a great many techniques for applying policy to what names can be registered, and provisioning
technology to how they are instantiated in the DNS, in support of keeping "variant" names behaving
similarly to each other, or in preventing the use of such variants as might be considered confusing or
dangerous.

</p>
<p>
In addition, there are new proposals for DNS protocol to support "aliases" in the DNS as part of the desired
behavior of "variant" names: Names direction<a class='info' href='#BNAME'>[BNAME]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yao, J., Lee, X., and P. Vixie, &ldquo;Bundle DNS Name Redirection,&rdquo; 12&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, and "Zone clone". 
</p>
<p> All of the solutions have their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, there are a couple of limitations
they all share. Every mechanism existing or proposed to support "aliases" in the DNS requires that
one name be designated as the "canonical" name ("preferred" in the terminology of the JET variant mechanism)
and any others bundled with it are to be considered "variants" or "aliases". The only known way to enforce a 
symmetrical or equivalent association is via careful registry provisioning within and across domains. In addition,
the different "alias" mechanisms differ in subtle ways that have to be carefully reviewed against the desired
behavior of the DNS in support of different types of "variants".

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Mapping itself</h3>

<p>
It was recognized as part of the original specification of the DNS that a host can have many names; in fact
this expectation predates the DNS, referring to the earlier specification of host names. In the simplest case 
for "aliases", Internet users need these multiple names to be resolved to the same IP address by a DNS server. 
The CNAME record <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, where "CNAME" is an abbreviation for "Canonical Name", 
is a way to designate aliases of the "real" or canonical name of a host. In some cases, 
CNAME can be used to produce the necessary association a bundle of variant domain names. But the CNAME only maps 
itself, not its descendants; in fact it is defined to not have descendants, as it is the only name at a node in
the DNS tree and can't exist at the same name as delegation. In the case of IDN variants, however, it is often 
desirable that the name map both itself and its descendants.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Mapping its descendants</h3>

<p>
In order to maintain the address-to-name mappings in a context of network renumbering, a DNAME record or 
Delegation Name record defined by <a class='info' href='#RFC2672'>[RFC2672]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crawford, M., &ldquo;Non-Terminal DNS Name Redirection,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> was invented to create an alias for all its 
subdomains. In contrast, the CNAME record creates an alias only of a single name (and not of its subdomains).
As with the CNAME record, the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name.  If a DNS 
resolver sends a query without EDNS<a class='info' href='#EDNS0'>[EDNS0]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vixie, P., &ldquo;Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0),&rdquo; August&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>, or with EDNS version 0, then a name server 
synthesizes a CNAME record to simulate the semantics of the DNAME record. A DNAME record is very much like 
the CNAME record, but while the CNAME record only applies for one name, with a DNAME record one can create 
aliases for all the records for its subdomain.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Mapping itself and its descendants</h3>

<p>
Bundling of "variant" strings or names as domain names, possibly along with other use cases not yet identified,
require the ability to map a whole tree of the domain space to another domain.
The current DNS protocols do not support this function. A new DNS resource record <a class='info' href='#BNAME'>[BNAME]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yao, J., Lee, X., and P. Vixie, &ldquo;Bundle DNS Name Redirection,&rdquo; 12&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> 
has been proposed to deal with this problem.

</p>
<p>
The advantage of BNAME is that it would enable a class of "aliasing" behavior that some operators find desirable,
particularly in preference to some of the provisioning overhead they describe having to deploy to support
potentially large numbers of "bundles" of variants at multiple levels of the DNS tree. The disadvantage is that
it may not provide the behavior people really want while requiring the time and resources to code and deploy
any new DNS facility.

</p>
<p>
Alternatively, a proposal has been made that would leave CNAME as already specified, but eliminating the
constraint that a CNAME must be alone at a node in the DNS tree. This would avoid any coding and deployment
overhead associated with new RRtypes, while obtaining the desired behavior. Concerns expressed about it,
however, include the possible (but not yet specified) effort required for backwards compatibility to 
avoid harm to implementations that expect, and use, the old behavior.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Zone Clone</h3>

<p>
The proposal of "zone clone" or "dns shadow", is an alternative solution for a higher level of support than
the DNS currently provides for "alias" behavior across zones. In this scheme, a new RRtype, SHADOW, is specified;
it can exist at a zone apex and can be used to define "clones" or "shadows" of the zone content so that
records in the zone are reachable via lookups from multiple delegations. This mechanism varies fundamentally
from CNAME/DNAME/BNAME in that it creates a local copy on each cooperating authoritative server that has
the original zone, reachable by the names specified in the SHADOW RR. Its scope, then, is the zone as maintained
by an authoritative server rather than a single RRset (even one corresponding to a delegation).

</p>
<p> This scheme has the advantage that it allows a SHADOW zone to be used in all the same contexts as the
canonical or underlying zone, including contexts where a CNAME or DNAME (or, presumably, a BNAME) cannot appear,
such as in the RDATA of certain RRtypes. Of the proposed DNS protocol mechanisms, it probably comes closest to the
behavior some have requested as "equivalence," where none of the bundled or SHADOW names is canonical or 
preferred over the others. It does implicate an unknown level of effort to implement and support.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>[STW: Looking for examples for this section.] 
</p>
<p> Unsolved issues that will have to be considered in the definition of what "the same" means for the
DNS include the implications for DNSSEC, and whether "identical" resolution includes DNSSEC validation in the 
expected "identical" behavior.
</p>
<p> Another area of possible peril includes SSL certificates, "Host" headers as seen by web servers, and other 
security-relevant data often associated
with domain names. It will have to be considered whether, and how, the "sameness" property maps into the expected
behavior of security-related protocols that use domain names, particularly given that it's unlikely that all
operators will ever use the same set of constructs (whether in the DNS or elsewhere) to signal whether different
"names" are "the same" for purposes of the function of a particular application or protocol.

</p>
<p>
In addition, there is a large cluster of security risks at the user and application levels that motivate
significant portions of the interest in what it means to treat a set of names as "aliases" of
each other. One set of issues is around the expectation that two strings are seen as "different" by the user in
some obvious way (such as visually) but need to be treated as "the same". The potential for user confusion and
subversion is not hard to imagine in cases where two visually distinct strings are nonetheless likely to be
expected by the user to behave "the same" in some functional way. This is the case we have attempted to address
here. 
</p>
<p> There is a separate but complementary set of issues that arise around cases where strings that look "the
same" should nonetheless be treated as different-- the so-called "confusing visual similarity" problem. The
easy example is substituting the Unicode codepoint for a character in one script, or a string of them, for 
the Unicode codepoints for similar-looking characters in an altogether different script. This has a different
set of potential risks to users, and has not been discussed here. It's often closely related to the "alias"
issue we have attempted to deal with, however, which poses risks of its own to analysis of the either subject.
