 Abstract

  This document provides the final clarification of the
  conclusions resulting in the expansion of 'RFC 1518 and 1519',
  which redefines the 'CIDR' notation as the 'Network Descriptor',
  and proves that the IP Address Pool of the IPtX Specification
  is greater than IPv6. And more importantly, because these
  conclusions reveal the actual design of the Binary Communication
  System, the Revolutionary impact sustained, is an upheavel
  affecting the entire field of Computer Science. In other words,
  IPtX is a more powerful and cost effective IP Addressing
  Specification that when using the 'IPtX-MX Routing Protocol'
  {'2^X : 1' Compression Ratio}, the interface of the "Front-End"
  can mimic or simulate a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address. And this, in
  conjunction with the IPtX Overlay, provides a 100% Backward
  Compatibility with the IPv4 Specification, in the Backbone
  environment approaching an unlimited size 'Bit-Map' Address Space.



 Introduction

  The "CIDR" Concepts, the 'Network Descriptor' and the
  'Bit-Mapped' IP Address, provided the bases for the comparison
  between IPv4, IPv6, and the IPtX IP Addressing Specifications,
  which concluded that these are different expressions of equal
  definitions. That is, mathematically speaking, the IP Address
  Pools of the IPv4 and the IPv6 Specifications, mathematically
  defines the variable Coefficient of an Identical Base Pool of
  IP Addresses, or X(2^32); given that 'X' respectively equals
  '1' and '7.9228163 x 10^28'.

  Where IPv4 = 1(2^32)
  and IPv6 = 7.9228163 x 10^28(2^32) = 2^128 = (2^32)^4.

  However, the IP Address Pool for the IPtX Specification is
  mathematically defined by the equation:

             IPtX  = X(2^32) + 16,500,000.

  Nevertheless, these additional IP Addresses, because only the
  "Network Descriptors" are different, (approximately 16.5 Million
  Shared) are Host or Client IP Addresses, which cannot be used to
  establish a direct Internet Connection because of the Logic
  problems, the decisional conflicts with the Routers. In other
  words, the expansion of the 'CIDR' concept(s), which
  mathematically defines the expression; 'X(2^32)', can only
  provide a Bit-Map that uniquely Identifies every IP Address
  within every Address Class, or the IP Address Range the
  expression defines, essentially availing the entire Range of IP
  Addresses to the Global-Net.

 1. The Classless Inter-Domain Routing Architecture, or CIDR


  The Classless Inter-Domain Routing Architecture, or CIDR, was
  derived from the so called; "strategies for address assignment of
  the existing IP address space with a view to conserve the address
  space and stem the explosive growth of routing tables in default-
  route-free routers" [9]. It was in reality, an Expansion of the
  'Default Addressing Structures' existing in the Address Class
  System. The popular claim nevertheless, boasted the elimination of
  the Address Class System. These Claims needless to say, were
  fashioned by the Authors, whose works represented their personal
  interpretation(s), because the works comprising RFC's 1517, 1518,
  and 1519 were never fully understood. The truth nonetheless, was
  clearly explained in RFC 1519, whose discourse dealt specifically
  with the way the Routers, and the Routing Protocols interpreted,
  or dealt with the IP Address, and not the elimination of the
  Address Class System per se. In other words, the Routers and the
  Routing Protocols were limited to using only the 'Default
  Addressing Formats', which represented Class A, Class B, and the
  Class C Addressing Specification. And to deal with the prospect,
  or the possibility of an IP Addressing Shortage, a plan was
  devised (RFC's 1517, 1518, and 1519), which actually involved not
  only the initial 'Default Addressing Formats', from Class A, B,
  and C, but the remaining fractional subcomponents from each of
  their respective Octets as well. In fact, while RFC 1519
  specifically designed the CIDR Architecture to take advantage of
  Class C, it did not weaver in its mention of the same
  implementation for the Class A Specification. It could be said in
  other words, that the CIDR Architecture represents an Un-Finished
  version of the 'IPtX Protocol Family Specification'. However,
  because of the MISNOMER, 'CLASSLESS', the process of SUB-DIVIDING
  a Class (In particular; Class A, and Class C), was never fully
  understood. Hence, the CIDR Architecture is the Sub-division of a
  CLASS SYSTEM, or a Class Addressing System that has been
  SUB-DIVIDED, which represents the Class, or the Whole, having a
  Greater Number of Constituents.
  
  In other words, the CIDR Architecture actually represents; The
  'Inter-Domain IP Bit Mapped Address Routing Architecture'. Because
  this, in essence, is what is really happening to the IP Address,
  and this is the IP Addressing Format that the Router and the
  Routing Protocols are dealing with. Therefore, the Class Addressing
  System is a format that implements a Network IP Address using a
  specified number of BITs, and in this case, it is either '8', '16',
  '24', or '32' Bits. Needless to say, any further Sub-Division, or

  use of some Smaller Portion or Constituent, does not constitute a
  departure nor eliminate the Existence of the Address Class System.
  Hence, the CIDR Architecture actually reinforced the Class Concept
  and proved that, without changing the entire Addressing Architecture
  defining the 'IP Bit Mapped Address or the IP Bit Mapped Address
  Space', the Whole, is indeed the Sum of its Parts.




 2. The Interpretation of the conclusion's Expansion of 'CIDR';
     Defining the "Network Descriptor"


  When defining the New 'CIDR' Architecture as representing the
  collective Extension for RFC's 1517, 1518, and 1519, we must
  first list the functional components, or Highlights, noted as
  the objectives or purpose supporting each of these papers,
  individually. That is, there must be comparison between the
  definition or description of the functional purpose of the
  'CIDR' Architecture as represented in each of these papers,
  compared with the New 'CIDR' Architecture this paper actually
  represents.


RFC 1517 (Maintained promoted a fear of IP Address Loss, and
          Astronomical growth in the size of the Routing Tables):

"- Exhaustion of the class-B network address space. One
   fundamental cause of this problem is the lack of a network
   class of a size that is appropriate for a mid-sized
   organization. Class-C, with a maximum of 254 host addresses,
   is too small, while class-B, which allows up to 65534 addresses,
   is too large to be densely populated.  The result is inefficient
   utilization of class-B network numbers.

-  Routing information overload. The size and rate of growth of the
   routing tables in Internet routers is beyond the ability of
   current software (and people) to effectively manage.

-  Eventual exhaustion of IP network numbers."

Argument in Opposition (Justification of the New 'CIDR' Architecture):


  Clearly, using the expanded 'CIDR' Architecture, when using the
  'CIDR'Network Descriptor, the Reality of IP Address Exhaustion now
  defines a wasted use of IP Addresses. In other words, Viable IP
  Address that could have been use to establish an Internet Connection,
  Connecting the Network's Backbone-Domain to the Internet, were
  assigned for the Host IP Addresses. This is further clarified by a
  Comparison of the "Internet Protocol v4 Address Space, and the use
  of the CIDR Network Descriptor displayed in Table I:

RFC 1518 (Which deals more with the actual Structure of the Internet,
          or its Hierarchical Structure , and IP Address allocation
          and Routing, than the actual 'CIDR' Architecture) where by,
          the points are specified as:

     There are two aspects of interest when discussing IP address
     allocation within the Internet. The first is the set of
     administrative requirements for obtaining and allocating IP
     addresses; the second is the technical aspect of such
     assignments, having largely to do with routing, both within a
     routing domain (intra-domain routing) and between routing domains
     (inter-domain routing). This paper focuses on the technical
     issues.    

     The architecture and recommendations in this paper are oriented
     primarily toward the large-scale division of IP address
     allocation in the Internet.

Argument in Opposition (Justification of the New 'CIDR'
Architecture): 

  While there is a lot that can be said regarding RFC 1518,
  especially since this is a proposal which advocates a great
  deal of dependency upon ISP's, whose entire existence is
  based upon the Economy, the Consumer, and a Volatile Market.
  This actually means, an ISP has no guaranteed Future, regarding
  either the use of the IP Address Base, or their Routers for a
  thoroughfare. In other words, while this RFC did mention some
  good points, these arguments are supported in the IPtX
  Specification. It nevertheless, maintained more the soundings
  of a White Paper Solicitation for a New System Overall, than an
  actual presentation representing 'CIDR' Architecture. Needless
  to say, some of the problems discussed, and emphasized
  repeatedly, addressed the need for a Internet Hierarchy, while
  dismissing the need to expand the number of Backbone connections,
  this is the main point of consideration when addressing the
  concept of an Internet Hierarchy.

RFC 1519 (While this RFC should be the replacement for RFC 1517,
         because it is clearly derived from RFC 1517, it claims to
         Obsoletes RFC 1338, which I have not read. And while this
         paper also disputes some of the proposals outlined in RFC
         1518 {Noting Specifically the causes for a loss of
         aggregation efficiency; Organizations which are multi-homed,
         and Organizations which change service provider but do not
         renumber.}. Nevertheless, one thing this RFC does, that the
         others so far do not, is that, it Mathematically Introduces
         the beginnings of Foundation for the 'CIDR' Architecture.)
 

Argument in Opposition (Justification of the New 'CIDR' Architecture):

  Nonetheless, while this RFC introduces the basic Mathematical
  Foundation for the 'CIDR' Architecture, and sets the fundamentals
  for the hardware and software specifications for Networking in a
  Supernetted Environment, it actually does nothing to prevent IP
  Address wasted on Host Assignments. This is because the foundation
  of the 'CIDR' Architecture was derived from the IPv4 specification,
  which means there was no way, short of a New IP Addressing System,
  could this waste be avoided. However, this is not the problem with
  the IPtX specification, because it De-Emphasizes the HOST IP Address,
  and gives it secondary functional value, which defines a dummy Host.
  Needless to say, this was the foundation that was needed to get the
  'Ball Rolling'. Nevertheless, while RFC 1519 developed the
  Mathematical foundation for the 'CIDR' Architecture, it never fully
  Exploited the benefits this Architecture maintains.

                           Definitions


  CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing is an IP Address Resolution
        Technique that provides a way to resolve any Binary Number(s)
        into its the Integer Translation to verify an IP Address,
        which is writen in 'Dotted Notation' and defined by '4' 8 Bit
        Octets. 




  CIDR Network Descriptor: It is a 2 Part Number used to resolve,
                           or discover the Integer representing
                           Binary Number defining the Network
                           Bit-Mapped IP Address.

  [Where by, the Digits to the Right of the Colon Represents the
   Starting Point for the IP Address Class Range in Binary Notation,
   or Network IP Address assigned to the Specified IP Address Class
   Range. And the Digits to the Left of the Colon represent the Count
   of Bit Mapped Displacement, or the Number of Binary Digits the
   Network IP Address uses. In which case, the '/XXXX:XX' notation
   would be used to Identify the Bit-Mapped Address Class and the
   Address Class Range of a Network IP Address.] 








  Nevertheless, the definitions noted above, concludes the argument by
  providing logical support for Re-Defining the 'CIDR' notation as the
  "Network Descriptor", which comprises a Switch, and a 2-part Number
  that defines the entire Range of every IP Address, including the
  Address Class Range mapping every Octet for the Network portion of
  the IP Address defines.

 3.  The IPtX and IPv4 IP Addressing Schemes – 100% Compatibility 



  The IPtX IP Addressing Scheme is a logically derived 'Internet
  Protocol Addressing Family' that is founded upon the IPv4 IP
  Addressing Specification. In other words, because IPtX utilizes the
  same Bit-Mapped Binary Addressing Format, which does not require any
  deviation from the operational infrastructure of the IPv4 Address
  Space. It maintains a 100% Backward Compatibility with IPv4, which
  is retained throughout an expansion capability defining an
  Infinitely Bit-Mapped IP Address Space using only a 64 Bit Header.
  There is however, the one noted difference in the IPv4 and the IPtX
  Sppecifications, which defines a distinction between the respective
  "Subnet-Mask" and the "Subnet-Identifier" that allows the IPtX
  Address Pool to be greater than IPv4 and IPv6, when using the same
  Bit-Mapped IP Address Space. Needless to say, while this distinction
  might at first, appear to be a strong departure from the IPv4 Format.
  It’s only a 'Binary Switch' that uses the elements from the Set,
  {X,Y}, to provide the ability the Change ((between) or (Extend)) the
  'Programmed Functions' or 'Operations' defining the "Subnet-Mask"
  and the "Subnet-Identifier". In any case, it should be clearly
  understood, the definition of the "Subnet-Identifier" extends the
  definition of the "Subnet-Mask" by providing the ability to Change
  the Range of the Subnet, which specifies the range of the Host IP
  Address. And this, it should be noted, is the Distinguishing
  Mathematical Hallmark that assigns every IP Address in the IPv4
  Specification to the IP Address Pool, with the added benefit of the
  creation of a Host IP Address Pool. Now, if the Address Spaces were
  equal, the number of available IP Address in the IP Address Pool
  assigned to the IPv4 Specification, given that IPtX is defined as
  the extension of IPv4, exceeds the number of available IP Address
  in the IP Address Pool assigned to the IPv6 Specification.
  Nevertheless, the validity of the forgoing is supported by the
  conclusions from the mathematical analysis and comparison of Tables
  III, IV, and V.

  The mathematical analysis of the result from Table III and Table IV
  reveals that when the "Subnet-Mask" is equal to the "Subnet-
  Identifier". The division of the Address Classes in the IPv4
  Spreification, is defined by the "Network Descriptor" as; the
  Logical Expansion of each of the Address Classes in the IPv4
  Specification, through the use of the Network ID designation, "255",
  in remaining Octets. And because the requirement of the "Subnet-
  Mask" mandates that 'only a Number from the Range of the Address
  Class' can be assigned a Network ID, then every Octet specifies one
  of the '4 Sub-Division' created in the Range of every Address Class.
  In other words, because the "Subnet-Mask" specifies the uses of the
  "255" designation in conjunction with the 'Range of the Address
  Class', to identify the Address Class associated with the Network
  ID. The logical use of the Octets remaining in the Range of every
  Address Class in conjunction with the "Subnet-Mask", is the logical
  consequence of the conclusion derived from the expansion, or
  sub-division of the 'Address Class Range' that was outlined in RFC
  1517, 1518, and 1519. Needless to say, since 'the Quantified Sum of
  the 'Product of the Network and Host IP Addresses' for every Address
  Class in Table IV, is equal to the Total Number of IP Address
  assigned to the Range of the Address Class defined by Table III,
  then the Addressing Specifications shown by these Tables are
  mathematically equal. In which case, mathematically speaking, it
  should be concluded that the IPtX Specification, by RFC 1517, 1518,
  and 1519, is the interpretation of the IPv4 Specification derived
  from the use of the "Subnet-Mask".

 4.   The Structural Comparison  - IPv6  vs.  IPtX



  The handicaps from using an askew Binary System, the Loop-Back
  Address (127), and the Subnet-Mask (255), makes it impossible for
  the IPv4 Specification, even through the progressive expansion using
  32 Bit additions for an equal Address Space, to match the IP
  Addresses available in the IP Address Pool of the IPv6 Specification.
  And clearly, the same fate, according to Figures 1 and 2, will befall
  the IPtX Specification. However, because the IPtX Specification
  maintains an expansion capability defining an Infinitely Bit-Mapped
  IP Address Space using only a 64 Bit Header. In which, the
  'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone Routers' would be assigned a Network ID,
  which would absorb the Bit-String of the Address Space beyond the 32
  Bit-Mapped IP Address Space defined by the IPt1 Specification. And
  since, the losses represented by Figures 1 and 2, at infinity, are
  not discernable. The IPtX Specification maintains an IP Address Pool
  Capacity, which is theoretically, infinitely larger than the IP
  Address Pool availability in the IPv6 Specification (See Figure 3).


                 IPv4 Specification

           IPv4 = 32 Bit Address Space

                                = 149,040,104 IP Addresses




                 IPv6 Specification

           IPv6 = 128 Bit Address Space

     IPv6 IP Address Pool = (2^32) x (2^32) x (2^32) x (2^32)
                          =  2^128 = X(2^32)

  The "Trunk-Identifier" Specification (Spec.) contains the Zone IP
  and IP Area Code. And given that Software can assign the Zone IP
  and IP Area Code to any location/destination. Eventually it will
  be necessary to know the 18 Digit IP Address: ZoneIP, IP Area Code,
  Network IP Address. And noting that any Trunk-Id beyond 96 Bits
  might seem ridiculous, because of the inherent limitations of the
  design specifications for the "Network Descriptor”, (+/0000:00).
  However, assigning a 'Router-ID' that requires Special
  Authentication between communicating Routers could easily absorb
  any Number of Bits beyond the IPt4 Specification.

        the "Front-End" and the "Back-End" of IPv4, or a design that
        to mimics the "Front-End" of IPv4, with a new "Back-End"
        design specification that defines an Alternate

  Nevertheless, it should be clearly understood, that if the
  'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone Routers' were assigned to the
  "Trunk-Identifier", then there must be a way to verify, resolve,
  or confirm the "Zone IP and the IP Area Code" Address defining the
  "Trunk-Identifier". In other words, the IPtX Specification can
  maintain the "Subnet-Identifier", use the "Network Descriptor"
  to verify the "Trunk-Identifier", and exhaust, without loss, every
  available IP Address in the Address Pool defined by the equation 1
  (eq-1):






   eq-1:    IPtX  = X(2^32) + 16,900,000 = Infinity



   eq-2:    IPv6  = X(2^32)
                  = (2^128)
                  = (256^16)
                  = 3.4028237 x 10^38 





  The process of maximizing the Address Pool defined by equation 1,
  is a '3' Step procedure, in which the first step exhaust all of
  the available IP Addresses in the IPv4 Specification. The second
  step requires changing the Symbol used as the "Network Designator"
  for the "Subnet-Identifier" (255 Or 256), and the third step
  requires expanding the function of the Switch for the "Network
  Descriptor". To achieve the first goal, multiply the Network and
  Host IP Addresses from Table IV, and use the product to represent
  the total number of Networks, leaving the Host total unchanged.
  And after the "Network Descriptor" and the "Subnet-Identifier"
  has been redefined, as provided in Table V. The adjusted results
  now reveals that the total number of available IP Addresses in
  the Address Pool for the IPtX Specification is equal to equation
  1, and it exceeds the amount assigned to the IPv6 Specification,
  when the size of the Bit-Mapped Address Space is equal to both
  Addressing Specifications (See Table VI).

 Note: From Table V, the "Network Designator", which is symbolized
       as; ' F ', could just as easily, been assigned to defined
       any symbol, (e.g.; '257') except for ' 0 '(representing
       ' 00 ', the Binary equivalent of ' 1  ') and any assignment
       represented in the Range of the Addressing Specification. In
       any case, it should be clearly understood that when every
       available IP Address is used for IP Addressing. The IPtX
       Addressing Schematic, (where fig. 5 and fig. 6 respectively
       denotes IPt1 and IPt2 Specifications) becomes nothing more
       than an OVERLAY, which is used to facilitate the
       visualization of the Topology for the Structure of the
       Network Design. And this is an extremely important advantage
       when designing a Network containing hundreds (or thousands)
       of Servers and several thousand (or Million) Hosts assigned
       to Subnets. [It is important to note, ' F ' represents the
       'NULL SET' or TRUE ZERO {the Traditional European
       Representation for True Zero}, and ' 0 ' is EQUAL to ' 00 ',
       which defines the Binary equivalence of ' 1 ':
       '00' = '0' = '1'.]

 Special Note: The simplification of the Network IP Addressing
               format into the 'Zone IP', the 'IP Area Code',
               and the 'Network IP Address', as provided by the
               IPtX Specification, could also REPLACE the format
               currently being used by the Telephone Systems all
               over the World. In other words, there is an EASY,
               'Off-The-Shelf' procedure for DIALING any Telephone
               Number defined by the 18 Digit String from the
               'IPtX' Specification {See "TELe-RIP" Protocol}:



 1. Dial First - Key in the digits representing the 'ZONE IP'

 2. Dial Next - Key in an Asterisk " * " the 'End-Start Statement'(:)'

 3. Dial Second - Key in the digits representing the 'IP AREA CODE' 

 4. Dial Next - Key in an Asterisk " * " the 'End-Start Statement'(:)'

 5. Dial Third - Key in the All '12' digits of the 'NETWORK IP ADDRESS'


  eg. Direct Trunk-Identifier, and respective Local "ENUM" Dialing:

      a. Dial Zone IP:  '123:213:121.0.12.3' =               
                       '123 * 213 * 121-000-012-003';

      b. Dial IP Area Code: '123:213:121.0.12.3' =
                            ' * 213 * 121-000-012-003';

      c. Dial Local '123:213:121.0.12.3' = ' * * ' 121-000-012-003';

       Where it is not possible to define the Zone IP,
       IP Area Code, or Network IP Address with ' 0 '.

Special Note: In the IPtX Specification any Contiguous String of
              ZERO(s) is not a mathematically viable IP Address,
              because the IP Address Pool equation, X(X^32),
              defines a sequence of counting by successive
              additions of ‘1’. That is, using Zero(s), while not
              a problem for the IPtX Specification, it is however,
              a problem for IPv6. In other words, the problems
              inherent in the IPv6 Specification pertain primarily
              to the difficulties arising from the 48 Digit Number
              used to represent the Default format of an IP Address.
              And while there are Rules which define the use of the
              " :: " as the replacement for the Contiguous ZERO(s)
              String, because they are not mathematically viable,
              the problem is exacerbated. Furthermore, since I have
              not found any documentation that specifically defines
              how to distinguish between 2 or more Addresses
              defining a different number of ZERO(s) in the
              Contiguous String, which might occur in the Start,
              Middle, or Trailing portion of the Address. Clearly,
              the " :: " cannot be used as the solution for the size
              reduction of an IPv6 Address, or the replacement for a
              Contiguous String of ZERO(s), at least, not without
              the necessary Rule(s) explaining its use. Nevertheless,
              these inadequacies are further compounded by defining
              the IP Addressing Format as having a variable length,
              which may be greater than 128 Bits, and the "::" as a
              compressor of the leading and/or trailing zeros, or as
              the replacement for the multiple 16-bit Zero Groups
              with a specification that limits its use, number of
              occurrences, in an address. And this, needless to say,
              defines the gist of the mathematical failings of
              every supporting document, including RFC 2373, and
              more importantly, the reasons the Chinese developed
              the IPv9 Addressing Specification.

  It should have been quite clear from documents expounding the
  development of the design for the 'IPtX' Specification that the
  "Network Descriptor" provided the means to identify the
  "Trunk-Identifier", which defines the IP Address assigned to
  the 'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone Routers'. In other words, from
  'Table V - Definitions', the "Network Descriptor" allows for the
  resolution of the Trunk-Identifier ID and the resolution of the
  entire Length of the Network IP Address String. And while the
  "CIDR" notation was exploited even further during the creation
  of the IPv6 Specification; because the symbol, ' /128 ',
  specifies the length for the Bit-Mapped IP Address, which defines
  the size of the 128 Bit-Mapped IPv6 Address Space. The "Network
  Descriptor" provided the ability to separate, or distinguish
  between the addresses assigned to the 'TelCo-Xchge or Backbone
  Routers' and the 'Network IP Address'. And this specified the
  Length defining the Network IP Address as '32 Bits' in the IPtX
  Specification, even if the size of its Address Space was equal to
  or greater than the 128 Bit IPv6 Specification.

  Nevertheless, this procedure allows the retention of the more
  familiar structure defining a Network IP Address, which is similar
  to the ‘Telephone Number’ and defined by the IPv4 Specification.
  And clearly, this mathematically clarifies the interpretation of
  the IPtX Specification (See Table VII), which is logically derived
  from IPv4, by proving that the number of available Addresses in
  its IP Address Pool is greater than the IPv6 Specification.
  Furthermore, since it was only in the configuration of the Router
  where “CIDR” was addressed, “CIDR”, as with the “Network
  Descriptor” can be automatic, and remain only as the concerns for
  the Network Engineer, because its affect lies outside the boundary
  of the Network Domain. In other words, IPtX is a more powerful and
  cost effective IP Addressing Specification, which allows the
  interface of the “Front-End” to mimic or simulate the IPv4
  Specification, a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address, in the Backbone
  environment of an unlimited size IP Address Space.

  6.1  Special IANA Consideration


    While Router Authentication may prove vital for Security
    Considerations. However, Address resolution could be accomplished
    more easily using a '3 State CIDR Network Descriptor Switch'
    identified as; {0, -1, +1}:


     a) Router-ID: /0000:00 or
        'E' Exponental Operator: /0000:00E00; 00E00 = 00^(00 thru 99)

  {e.g. 96E99 = 96^99 Bits ~ (7.9228163 x 10^28)^99 copies of IPt1}

     b) Trunk-Identifier: +/0000:00 or
        'E' Exponental Operator: +/0000:00E00; 00E00 = 00^(00 thru 99)

  {e.g. 32E10 = 32^10 Bits ~ (4,294,967,296)^10 copies of IPt1}

     c) Network IP Address: -/0000:00 or
        'E' Exponental Operator: -/0000:00E00; 00E00 = 00^(00 thru 99)


     d) 'ANSI Trace-Ping-ID: Multi-Conditional Switch
        defining Additional Command Statements - 
        ±//0000:00|? and //0000:00|? {Where '|?' = HELP!}



   The above considerations represent the conclusions derived from
   the foundation of ‘RFC(s) 1518 and 1519', which actually define
   ‘Address Segment Routing’. Given that in the Binary System of
   counting, sums by the addition of ‘1’s’ are from the Right, and
   leading Zeros to the Left are insignificant. The conclusions
   clearly establish the above mathematical expressions as a viable
   representation of the Router’s interpretation of an IPtX
   ‘Bit-Mapped’ IP Address. That is, the ‘CIDR Network Descriptor’
   provides the Router’s depiction of an IP Address, which only
   acknowledges the routing of the Network-ID according to the
   structure of the Network’s IP Address defined by the Address Class
   Range: ‘±/0000:00E00 and /0000:00E00’. Hence, this is the gist of
   an extremely powerful method, ‘Address Segment Routing’, which
   provides the translation of the Network Address defined by the
   Schematic representing the IPtX IP Addressing Specification, and
   any length of one or more additional Address Segments defining the
   total length of the IPtX Bit-Mapped Address.

CIDR Network Descriptor expands IPtX Add Space      October 27th, 2006



   In other words, the ‘CIDR Network Descriptor’, in addition to
   defining the mathematical expression of the routed Address, it
   also acts as the Address Mask, resolving the Integer, one Bit at
   a time, in a process that defines every Address defined by the
   Schematic of the IPtX Addressing Specification. And finally,
   these conclusions also confirm the necessity of the 48 Bit-Mapped
   IP Address (18 digits), as the required identification to
   specifically determine the exact location/destination of the
   communicating nodes.

   Nevertheless, the method of Counting that is defined by
   ‘±/0000:00E00 and /0000:00E00’, defines a "One-to-One'
   Correspondence with the Unary Element, ' 1 ', which defines the
   Sum of the Elements contained in the Set defining the 'CIDR
   Network Descriptor, as the Cardinality representing the count of
   the number of elements the Set Contains. Thus, yielding the exact
   depiction, from the Sum of the number ' 1's ', this equals the
   Number representing the IPtX IP Address. In other words, the Sum
   of the Bit Count defined by the '00E00' String is equal to the
   Number representing the remaining portion of the IP Address that
   is not defined by the Address Class Range, which defines the 8
   Bit '0000' Prefix of the IP Address defined by the Network
   Descriptor. However, allowing the '00E00.0000' String to be equal
   to the method defining 'Exponential Enumeration' would be easier,
   because an Exponential Equation could Mask and Un-Mask the Integer
   representing the IP Address(s); ‘±/0000:00E00.0000 and
   /0000:00E00.0000’. And this method would also represent an exact
   count of the Sum of the ' 1's ', because it equals the one-to-one
   relationship that assigns only one Number from the result of,
   '2^X', the 'Exponent', to one IP Address. Furthermore, it is also
   behooving to note, that since ( ±/ )‘0000:00E00.0000' and
   ( / )'0000:00E00.0000’ is Routable, its Function as the 'Network
   Descriptor' still remains useful, because it allows for Address
   Segment Routing, and retains the original definition of its
   Address String Length; '±/0000:00'. In other words, the expansion
   of the 'CIDR Network Descriptor' defines a Routable Mathematical
   Expression, defining a '2^X : 1' 'Exponential Compression Ratio',
   which can be used in either a Static or Dynamic Mode.


        Note: The logical expansion of the 'CIDR Network Descriptor'
              defines a Routable 'Universal Expression', which is a
              Mathematical Expression defined by an 'Exponential
              Equation', expressing the value of the result that
              uniquely represents the value of the Quantified Sum
              of the Component Strings defining the numerical value
              of every IP Address defined by the IPtX Specification.
              And this, as it will be clearly realized, changes the
              calculation for the Bit/Data Transfer Rate.

   In any case, it should by quite clear that the foregoing uniquely
   defines the IPtX Specification, a distinct difference from IPv4,
   that provides the exact rendering of Binary Enumeration, which is
   equal to the sequential incrementation resulting from the summation
   of the progressing using ' 1's '. In other words, since the Binary
   equivalent of the Unit displacement, given by eq-5, defines the
   'Exponential Expression' derived from the Binary Equation defined
   by the Mathematics of Quantification, which defines an
   incremental progression using the result from the summation of
   ' 1's '. It defines the result, 2^Q, from the equation as
   representing the Quantified Sum of the Binary Expressions defining
   the Numerical Displacement of the 8 Bit Segment that defines the

   eq-6:  2^X  =  8 Bit String  = " 1 thru 256 "

   eq-7:  (2^X) +  (2^X) +  (2^X) +  (2^X) =  2^Q = 2^N,
          given that { . } = { + }, then
          8 Bit. 8 Bit. 8 Bit. 8 Bit = 32 Bit =  2^Q,
          XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX =  2^Q  = 00E000.0000...,
          2^Q now defines an incremential progression,
          using the summation from the additions of
          ' 1's ', which approaches a Bit displacement
          defining an infinite length; see eq-9.


   And clearly, given that 2^Q = 00E000.0000..., where 2 = 00 and
   Q = E000.0000..., the Masking and Un-Masking procedure for
   protocol encapsulation is extremely elementary, because it is a
   comparison defined by the laws of addition and subtraction. In
   other words, the Sum of any number of the Binary Expressions
   equaling the value of the 8 Bit Address Segment defining an Octet
   of an IP Address, {where the 00E00.0000 = IPtX IP Address as the
   Sum of the Binary Expressions defining the Total Number of Octets
   the IP Address contains.) is equal to the value of the Integer
   defining an IPtX IP Address. Hence, if there is a difference
   between any of the values defining an Octet or their resulting
   Sum, 2^Q, it would be determined, confirmed, or verified by the
   Translation / Resolution of an IP Address from the Masking or
   Un-Masking of the 'Exponential Expression(s)'. And this uniquely
   defines, by eq-8, the 'IPtX Mathematical Expression' Routing
   Protocol, and the ability of IPtX Specification to define an
   Un-Limited IP Address Pool: see 'The Anatomy of the IPtX-MX
   Routing Protocol'.

   eq-8:      0000:00E000.0000... ; 2^X + 2^X + 2^F + 2^F = 2^Q
              2^Q = IP Address value; or value of the Octets Sum.

   In other words, Binary Enumeration, the method of incrementation
   using ' 1 ' that defines the ' 2^X : 1 ' Ratio, sustains a
   practical limit, which is defined by the current technology.
   However, with the current technology it might be easier if the
   Exponent of the ' 2^X : 1 ' Ratio defined a Payload Capacity of
   256 Bits, or the equation, 2^256, which defines a Payload
   capacity equaling 256 copies of a 50,000 page Book. And this,
   it should be reasoned, with the appropriate upgrades would allow
   the Ratio defining the current Data Transmission Rates, and a
   host of related technological products, to obtain a performance
   increase by that might be greater than a ' 4 : 1 ' Ratio.

  6.2   Special IANA Consideration

        - 6.2.1 - Closing Argument




   The proof of the mathematical validity for the Ratio defining 
   the ' 2^X : 1 ' relationship between Binary and Unary counting
   is given by:



        Since; 2^0 = 1, and (2^0) + (2^0) = 1 + 1 is True,


        then; If 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, ..., and 1 + N = IvN, is True,


        there is a relationship; defining every 'X', in '2^X',
        such that; for every value that the element 'Q' defines,
        also defines a unique element in I, the Set of Integers,


        then; '2^X' also defines an element of the Set of Integers,


        given that; for every '2^X' of the Set I, '2^X = Q',


        and; If 'X' defines an Element of the Set of Integers and an
        Element of the Set of Real Number,


        then; 'X' is Greater Than, or Equal To 'NvN + 1' and
        'NvN + 1.000...NvN + 1'.



        Hence: The Binary Set defines an Equation, '2^X, that
               equals the count defining the Sum of the incremental
               progression resulting from the Addition of '1's',
               which is equal to the progressive counting sequence
               defined by the Unary Set.


   This concludes the design specification(s) for the IPtX
   Addressing Protocol Family, with the implementation of the

   logically derived 'Intelligent Quantum Worm', which mimics the
   'Payload Carrying Capacity' of the 'Instruction Set' carried by
   a Cell of DNA. In other words, this discovery represents the
   capability of compressing a number of any length (Compression of

   it's Set, into Q = {1,2,3,4,...,N} = 1, by Nesting Encryptions
   of the Exponential Translation representing the exact Numerical
   arrangement of the members of the Set, Q. And more importantly,
   this discovery, when the correct Mathematical interpretation of
   the encoding for the Binary System is used, defines the 64 Bit
   Address as the Mask of the 'Intelligent Quantum Worm', the
   'IPtX-MX Universal Routing/Routed Protocol' Specification,
   which has a 'Theoretical Payload Carrying Capacity'

   In other words, the Binary Equation in the Ratio, '2^X : 1',
   actually defines the Unary Process of successive Additions of
   ' 1 ', which the counting by 1, represents every Numeral.
   However, the benefits of the Exponential Algorithm is that,
   regardless of the Numeral's length, it requires only 64 Bits
   to represent the count of the Integer depicting the Numeral.

   Nevertheless, the pointed fact is that, the mathematical
   translation of the foregoing conclusions in terms of the number
   of available IP Addresses, dramatically increases. In other
   words, the IP Address Pool representing the 64 Bit IP Address
   of the IPt2 Address Space, which is defined by the IPtX
   Specification, more closely approximates:


             16 Prefix Addresses


             99,987,654,321 Addresses in each Prefix Address Set


 And this means, there are;


             2^646,464(16 x 99,987,654,321) Encryption Keys, or;


 because this defines the Number of Encryption Keys for each
 Address in the Address Pool given by;


             " 0000:00E000.0000... "


 then the Total Number of Addresses in the IPt2 Specification equals:

  Even still, possible interpretation(s) notwithstanding,
  mathematically speaking however. The (" 00.0000...E000 ") String
  can only define the "Payload Carrying Capacity" of a Data
  Compression Engine. In which case, the Encryption Coding Strings
  can be included and defined as an integral part of the Data Stream
  Code, which has a ‘Bit-Count Length’ determined by the Scaleable
  'Payload Capacity' of the 'Polymorphing Intelligent Quantum Worm
  Protocol Data Compression Engine' (P-IQWP-DCE). Nevertheless,
  this clarification completes the design specification for the
  'Intelligent Quantum Worm Protocol', founded upon the logical
  derivation of the Binary System of Enumeration from the Mathematics
  of Quantification, it finalizes the unique design structure of the
  IPtX Protocol ‘Family’ Specification.


  And this is true since;


        ‘ 00.0000...E000 ‘  =  2^X  =  2^N   =  ‘ 00E000.0000... *‘;


  Noting more specifically that the Set of Points at which these Sets
  are equal, is Finite. Hence, the number of occurrences in which
  these Sets are equal is defined by;


                       ‘2^X  =  2^N ‘:


  “The Special Case defining the Distributive Laws representing the
  Binary and the Unary Sets*”. Furthermore, there is a broader
  interpretation of the “ P-IQWP-DCE “ Binary Algorithm, in which the
  Ratio, {2^X : 1} defining this engine represents the Probability or
  Likelihood of the occurrence of a ‘Security Event’ vs. “Quality of
  Service/Product” to prevent it, because ‘Security Protection Coding’
  is packaged in the “Payload”: with an excellent Virus Protection
  Software, e.g., - Consumes Limited or Balanced Security Code to
  Message Space Ratio – Possible Number of Virus Combinations vs.
  Anti-Virus Combinations ; This is an Absolute Protocol Protection
  Environment Ratio defining the “ P-IQWP-DCE “ Space  -

  Balance is Achievable or the Time required to perform a  ‘Security
  Event’ could be of such a duration, it would seem infinite! In
  which case, the {2^X : 1} Ratio represents the scale of
  comparison, providing the odds of determining the Probability of
  preventing a ‘Security Event’, when using the currently available
  Security Safe Guards. And more importantly – This Ratio {2^X : 1}
  actually depicts a ‘Fully Cognizance Autonomous Artificial
  Intelligence’, a True Binary Coding Environment, defining a
  logical mathematical foundation derived from the Laws of Set
  Theory and the Mathematics of Quantification. In other words,
  the spectrum of possibilities defined by ‘2X’ is unlimited;
  since ‘2^X’ represents the Binary equation defining the
  incremental progression by successive additions of ‘1’, and if
  2^X is an Element of the Real Number Set, then




                 ‘2^X = 3^X = 4^X = 5^X = N^X + 1’.




  In other words, since nesting is inherently defined, the ‘DCE’s’
  Payload could define a series of Binary Equations representing a
  Nested or Encapsulated Data Stream Transmission.

  In summary, the conclusions from Mathematics of Quantification that
  established a true Binary Environment, produced a Revolutionary
  method of Coding, using the Exponential Expression ‘2^X’,
  correlating the Mathematical Language of the Binary System,
  defining a Unary progression, resulting in the unique logical
  design of the IPtX Protocol Family Addressing Specification.
  Hence, the final imperative is to display”IPt2’s” remaining 64
  Bit-Mapped Protocol Specifications design for the 'Intelligent

  Address Pool correlating with the Address Class Specification
  of IPv4 – Furthermore, the additional benefits this expansion

  In other words, the IPtX Addressing Protocol "Family" is defined
  by a mathematical foundation that defines an incremental
  progression using successive additions of '1', which also defines
  the sequence of counting defined by the Unary set. In which case,
  if the mathematical laws defining the relationships for the Address
  patterns of the IPtX Specification are mathematically consistent,
  then Table VIX defines a mathematical expansion for every Address
  Class Specification defined by the IPtX Protocol "Family".

  1) Data Transmission Rates = 'DCE' Unit Classification

  2) 'Performance' & 'Dimensional Design' = 'DCE' Unit Classification 

  3) Data Transmission Communication Rates = 'DCE' Unit Classification

  4) Data Transmission Rates Coefficient = ' X '

  5) Data Transmission Rate(s) Equation = 'X(2^X) = 2^X = 2^N = X^X'

  6) Control Data Transmission Rates / Matching the Node(s) Rate(s)

  10) 'DCE' Unit Classification = “Calibrating the Encoding of Code’

      a) Defines New Binary Coding Operator for Software Construction
         and Design.

      b) Defines New Binary Definition for Instruction Set and Scale
         for CPU Design.

      c) Defines New Data Communication Hardware Orientation
         Connectivity Association Specification – Eliminating Device
         Drivers, USB, ATA, SCSI, etc, and a host of additional
         Hardware Control Protocols. 

      d) Scaleable 'DCE' Unit Defines a New Host IP Addressing
         Specification, which provides a functional use, by TABLE VIX,
         for the IPtX-MX Universal Protocol, that would allow Host
         IP Address Activation for a Direct Internet Connection
         - The Activiation of every Host defined in the Overlay of
         IPtX Specification {See TABLE VIX} - Adding a Host
         designation function to the CDIR Network Descriptor, which
         assigns the DCE Unit Protocol Specification to the trailing
         end Switch; 'h': e.g. ' /0000:00-h ' - and this allows every
         Network and Host IP Address to have a unique Identification
         in the IPtX Specification.

     e) Binary Encoding Conversion example; ‘1111 = 'DCE' Unit' = 2^X,
        or ‘ 8 ‘ = 111 = 'DCE' Unit' = 2^X = 2^3 ‘; the Benefits are
        easily realized when the Conversion represents a large Number.

  Nevertheless, the Intelligent Quantum Worm Technology maintains
  a scaleable range that defines  5 Address Class Specifications,
  which represent a different and independent copy of the IPt1
  Specification. And this defines the Address Pool of the 64 Bit
  IPt2 Specification, with a capacity equal to 5 copies of IPt1;


            or 5(2^32) = 5(4,294,967,296) = 2.147836 x 10^10;


            or "2.147836 x 10^10 'Intelligent Quantum Worms'"
                that can all share or be assigned to service
                4,294,967,296 IP Addresses. That is, this defines
                a { 5 : 1 } Ratio, a mathematical relationship
                sustained throughout the IPtX Specification, which
                defines approximately 5 different Worm Configurations
                for every IP Address Class defined by the IPtX
                Addressing Protocol Family Specification.


 Note: This defines the Theoretical Address Pool Capacity of
       the IPt2 Specification as being equal to:


         (0000:000E00.0000...), or (0000:000.0000...E00)

         'Router-ID + Trunk-Identifier + Network IP Address*

    0000:00E000.0000... + 0000:00E000.0000... + 0000:00E000.0000...



   Router-ID = 2(2.147836 x 10^10)(2^646,464) x (4,294,967,296)

                                 +

  Trunk-Identifier = 2(2.147836 x 10^10)(2^646,464) x (4,294,967,296)

 Network IP Address = 2(2.147836 x 10^10)(2^646,464) x (4,294,967,296)

        approximately available IP Addresses.


       This is a good approximation, because this value
       (2^646,464) changes, Higher to Lower, values definig
       5 Categories of the IPt2 Specification.

  In other words, this essentially provides the 'Intelligent
  Quantum Worm' Protocol with a Scalable "Payload Capacity",
  which defines a 3-D Spatial Distortion that mimics a Tunneling
  Effect. In which case, perhaps the "IPtX-MX Universal Protocol"
  should rightfully be called:


           An "Intelligent Quantum Tunneling Worm".


  Nevertheless, the ability to program or construct a 3-D Space,
  implies the possibility that today’s ‘Bit-Mapped’ Specification
  associates a Bit with a displacement equal to an extremely large
  Electron Surface Area, one that encompasses the measurement of an
  extremely large Pool (approximately 2^646,464) or Group of
  Electrons. In other words, the "Intelligent Quantum Tunneling
  Worm" Protocol, in such an environment, would define the Unit
  Bit as the minimum excitation energy required to displace an
  Electron One Electron-Mass Displacement Unit [6]. And then,
  if it’s A.I., there is the possibility that it could morph
  itself, acquiring the specifications to accommodate a 3-D
  Spatial Environment. - The Illusion by Shading, rendering
  any picture or video with a 3-D effect when displayed.













     Note: The actual difference the Theory of the IPtX
           Specification presents, is defined by the
           difference between Linear and Non-Linear
           Coding, or the choice between Encoding the
           Bit-Map of the Data Stream or Encoding the
           Bit-Map of the Equation for the Data Stream.

  Nevertheless, while the foregoing proof are confirmed by the
  conclusions from the proof of “Fermat’s Last Theorem”: However,
  a more thorough understanding of the results from the successive
  additions of '1', and the Basic Theory of Mathematics, which define
  Sequential Counting is required to understand the error in the
  current definition of Infinity; where 1/0 = INFINITY. And how is
  it possible to define an Infinitely Large Address Pool to the
  IPtX Specification. 

    The proof;

    First, accepting that 1/0 = INFINITY, is not true, since Division
    is defined [3] as Subtraction, then the results from the
    continuous operation defined by eq-a, is pointless, because the
    result from this equation defines the REMAINER, and if the
    difference between the Remainder and the Quotient equals Zero,
    then the solution, by eq-b, of 1/0, is equal to Zero.


         eq-a.     1 - 0 = 1 - 0 = ... = (1 - 0)vN = 1

         eq-b.     1 / 0 = 1 - 1 = 0


    And if it can be said that the relationship between the
    Unary Set and the Binary defines a { 1 : 11 } Ratio, where
    Cardinatility representing this Ratio, given by eq-c, is True. 



         eq-c.     ' 1 = 2 ' - Unary Set = {1}, Binary Set = {11}
                   "Given that:  11 = 1 + 1 = 2"

    Then the Definition of a Prime Number is Given By:‘


         eq-d.     '1 = 2’ - 'Prime Numbers'

              A 'Prime Number' or 'Prime Integer', is a positive
              integer, 'p Greater Than or Equal to 1', that has
              no positive integer divisors other than itself, 'p',
              and '1'.


    In which case, from the definition of a Prime Number, it can be
    concluded that if every Number except '1', is defined as the
    Progressive Additions of '1', then "1" defines the Absolute
    Number, which is equal to the Cardinal Number that defines the
    Universal Multiplicative Identity Element, representing every
    Item defining itself [2].

    Clearly, the Modern Numbering System evolve defining the Zero
    distinction as the Multiplicative Coefficient defining the
    Count of the Members in the Set of ' 1's ' containing 10
    Elements. Nevertheless, Nature's Mathematical System defines
    the Binary pair {0, 1}, as the symbols to be used for numerology,
    which ultimately refined into the more mathematical symbolic
    numerical representation used today.

    In other words, since '1' is the absolute Numeral, and the Binary
    and Unary Sets must, if they are equal and enumerate to infinity,
    map equally, in a One-to-One Correspondence with the Real Number
    Set, which is counted using successive additions of '1'. 

    Then the Ratio defining the relationship between the Binary and
    the Unary Sets, and represented in the mathematical expression
    defining eq-c, since any One-to-One defines a sequential count
    defined by the Unary Set as the successive additions using  1’s,
    also defines 2 Infinities. 


         eq-c. ' 1 = 2 '

      Unary Set = {1} = Infinity  =  Binary Set = {11} = Infinity


    Furthermore, since Infinity is not enumerable, then Infinity
    must define a Prime Number, because only the mathematical
    operations involving ‘ITSELF’ and ‘1’ are defined. 

    Hence, "Given that:  11 = 1 + 1 = 2", and since eq-c is true,
    then by eq-e, we have;


         eq-e.  'Infinity’ = (Infinity + Infinity) = 'Infinity’ 


   And from eq-d, since multiplication is equal to the quantified
   sum of addition, we have by eq-f;


         eq-f. 'Infinity’ = (Infinity + Infinity) = Infinities,
                     (Infinity + Infinity) = 'Infinity’


   Therefore, since eq-d, “ 1 = 2 - Prime Numbers ”, is true, then;


                       Infinity  =   Infinity

CIDR Network Descriptor expands IPtX Add Space      October 27th, 2006





   And this, since division is the quantified difference of the
   repeated subtractions performed on a constant, further implies;



      Infinity/Infinity = ‘ 1 ‘ and (Infinity - Infinity) = ' 0 '



   Nevertheless, since the foregoing equations defines the
   mathematical operations involving Infinity, and since these
   operations also defines the enumeration of the Elements defining
   the respective members contained in the Binary and Unary Sets.
   Then the Elements these Set respectively contain, each
   enumerate an individual count using successive additions of '1'
   in a One-to-One Correspondence, to reach an Infinite Count of
   the Members each Set contains.


   In other words, by definition [3], since the


                             Unary Set = {1},

   and the 

                             Binary Set = {0, 1}



   Then Infinity is the definition of 2 Sets, which defines;

   The Binary Set defines; 1 either followed by an Infinite Zero
   String, or a Decimal Point followed by an Infinite Zero String
   terminated with a 1.


   1) A ‘1’ followed by an Infinite String of Zeros

   2) 1 + 0vINFINITY...00000000000000000000000000000000000000.0

   The Unary Set defines an Infinite String of ‘ 1’s ‘, either before
   or after the Decimal Point.

   5) A ‘1’ followed by an Infinite String of ‘1’s’

   6) 1 + 1vINFINITY...1111111111111111111111111111111111111.0

   7) A ‘1’ proceeded by an Infinite String of ‘1’s’

   8) 0.1111111111111111111111111111111111111...1vINFINITY + 1


      Note: Both examples define every element contained in the Set
            of Real Numbers. And more importantly, if the Infinite
            Zero String is countable, then succeeding or following
            the Zero String is also countable... Also, this proof
            can be construed as equating the Count of the '1's' in
            the Unary Set with the Zeros, and the '1' (occurring at
            a Count one unit beyond the Infinite Zero String) in
            the Binary Set.

   There is no doubt that the profoundness of Figure 7 seems to
   overshadow the simplicity and flexibility of the design of the
   IPtX Addressing Protocol Family Specification. In which case,
   and rightfully so, I must conclude the Summary of the IPtX design
   specification with the explanation of the description defining the
   32 Bit version of IPtX-MX Protocol, and how it applies to the IPt1
   Specification. And this, it shall be seen, will provide a more
   gradual interpretation, elaborating the procedural change defining
   the steps of the expansive effects describing how “The CIDR Network

   with the correct mathematical expression reflecting these changes,
   which is supported by a logical argument derived from the proof

   In other words, Activation of the Host Address Pool by

   the resulting IPtX Address Pool equation; in a table of

   And more importantly, the flexibility of the Switch implemented

      Note: Because the ”DCE” Unit of the “IPtX-MX Protocol” can
            also act as the Bit-Mapped Translation of a ‘Carrier

  6.3   Special IANA Consideration
        - Current Definition(s) for the Measurement of the Bit
 
          {Information provided as a Courtesy of; “Wikipedia, the
           free Encyclopedia”}


   Currently defined mathematical relationship(s) defining the Unit
   Bit:


   Binary Digit –

   Claude E. Shannon first used the word bit in a 1948 paper. He
   attributed its origin to John W. Tukey, who had written a Bell
   Labs memo in 9 January 1947 in which he contracted "binary digit"
   to simply "bit", forming a portmanteau. Interestingly, Vannevar
   Bush had written in 1936 of "bits of information" that could be
   stored on the punch cards used in the mechanical computers of that
   time. A bit is like a light switch; it can be either on or off.
   A single bit is a one or a zero, a true or a false, a "flag" which
   is "on" or "off", or in general, the quantity of information
   required to distinguish two mutually exclusive states from each
   other. The bit is the smallest unit of storage currently used in
   computing.



   Unit Bit –

   The bit, as a unit of information, is the amount of information
   carried by a choice between two equally likely outcomes. It is
   the capacity of one binary digit. One bit corresponds to about
   0.693 nats (ln(2)), or 0.301 hartleys (logv[10](2)). The name bit
   is mostly used when discussing data capacity, emphasizing the
   storage of data as individual binary digits. The name “Shannon”,
   referring to the same unit, is mostly used when discussing
   information content, emphasizing aggregate information quantity.

   A bit refers to a digit in the binary numeral system (base 2).
   For example, the number 1001011 is 7 bits long. Binary digits
   are almost always used as the basic unit of information storage
   and communication in digital computing and digital information
   theory. Information theory also often uses the natural digit,
   called either a ‘nit’ or a ‘nat’. Quantum computing also uses
   ‘qubits’, a single piece of information with a probability of
   being true.

   The bit is also a unit of measurement, the information capacity
   of one binary digit. It has the symbol bit, and less formally b
   (see discussion below). The unit is also known as the ‘shannon’,
   with symbol ‘Sh’.

   Ban – 

   A ban, sometimes called a ‘hartley’ (symbol Hart), is a
   logarithmic unit, which measures information or entropy, based
   on base 10 logarithms and powers of 10, rather than the powers
   of 2 and base 2 logarithms, which define the bit. Like a bit
   corresponds to a binary digit, a ban is a decimal digit. A
   ‘deciban’ is one tenth of a ‘ban’. One ‘ban’ corresponds to about
   3.32 bits (logv[2](10)), or 2.30 ‘nats’ (ln(10)). A deciban is
   about 0.33 bits.


   Nat – 

   A nat (sometimes also nit or even nepit) is a logarithmic unit of
   information or entropy, based on natural logarithms and powers of
   e, rather than the powers of 2 and base 2 logarithms which define
   the bit. The nat is the natural unit for information entropy,
   corresponding to Boltzmann's constant for thermodynamic entropy.
   When the Shannon entropy is written using a natural logarithm,


                    H = E pv[i] ln pv[i]
                        i


   it is implicitly giving a number measured in nats. One nat
   corresponds to about 1.44 bits (logv[2](e)), or 0.434 hartleys
   (logv[10](e)).

   IEEE 1541 is a standard issued by the Institute of Electrical and
   Electronics Engineers (IEEE) concerning the use of prefixes for
   binary multiples of units of measurement related to digital
   electronics and computing.

   While the International System of Units (SI) defines multiples
   (and submultiples) based on powers of ten (like 10^3, 10^6, etc.),
   in computing multiples based on powers of two (like 2^10, 2^20,
   etc.) have been usually preferred. In the early times, this choice
   was made due to the intrinsic binary nature of computers, and
   often of computer equipment (such as RAM chips), considering that
   the error between 2^10 = 1024 and 10^3 = 1000 was small enough to
   favor binary multiples. Thus, SI prefixes, such as kilo- (k,
   usually misspelled as K), mega- (M) and so on, have been used to
   indicate binary multiples in computer-related quantities, that
   are not SI quantities. Moreover, there is not a consistent use of
   the symbols to indicate quantities such as bits and bytes. IEEE
   1541 sets new recommendations to represent those quantities and
   units unambiguously.

   After a trial period of two years, in 2005 IEEE 1541-2002 has been
   elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association,
   and it is now scheduled for maintenance in 2007.




  Special Note:  Clearly, the profound interpretation underpinning
                 the foundational theory for the IPtX Protocol
                 Specification, which transcends the prescribed
                 purpose defining its application, redefines the:

  - Electromagnetic Scale – providing Precision Tuning

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Changing the Propagation Frequency

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Changing the Radiation Frequency

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Changing the Energy Mass Relationship

  - Electromagnetic Scale – New Physics - Quantum Scale Theory

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Work Energy Relationship Redefined

  - Electromagnetic Scale – Resolving Frequency of an IP Address

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Resolving Radiation Exposure Issues

  - Quantum Scale Theory – A New Energy Cache Defined

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Defining the Electron Bit Relationship

  - Quantum Scale Theory – Mathematics of the Electromagnetic Spectrum






   It is of special importance to mention that IEEE, specification
   1541-2002, did not make any reference to the possibility of a
   Bit-Map association with an Electron. And this it can be said,
   is probably due, in part(s); to the inability to resolve a
   mathematical relationship associating the Unit Bit with the
   measurement of the Frequencies defined by the Electromagnetic
   Spectrum, the lack of an understanding of the Electronic States
   of Matter, or the failure to understand the mathematics of
   Exponential (Binary) Enumeration and the respective Logarithmic
   Translations resolving an Irrational Exponent.




   Nevertheless, while providing IANA, FCC, and all other noted
   Regulatory Agencies [defined with FCC responsibilities within
   their respective ZONE IP location(s); e.g. IEEE], with an
   extremely broad range of decision options, concluding the
   overall general design and operational procedures for the
   IPtX Addressing Protocol Family Specification. However,
   embedded within the context of this document are the
   Preferred, or Recommended Operational Procedures that mandates
   the continued existence of the mathematical continuity ascribed
   by the Hierarchy of the IPtX Specification, which assigns the
   controlling position of the Address Space (containing the
   "Front-End" and the "Back-End") to the "Front-End".

Work(s) in Progress;



 Computer Science / Internet Technology:


  These drafts represent the twelve chapters of the Networking Bible,
  designing a Network IP Addressing Specification that maintains a 100
  Percent backward compatibility with the IPv4 Specification. In other
  words, this is a design specification developed from the Theory of
  the Expansion of the IPv4 IP Addressing Specification, which allowed
  the representation of the Network for the entire World on paper, and
  the possibility of an Infinite IP Address Pool. Nevertheless, the
  Internet-Drafts listed below, 'Cited as Work(s) in Progress',
  explain the design Specification for the development of the IPtX
  (IP Telecommunications Specification) Protocol Addressing System and
  the correction of the Mathematical Error in the Binary System.

 Application Note: While it is not necessary to expound all of the
                   possible applications of the 'IPtX-MX Routing
                   Protocol', to mention a few however, it
                   encompasses the ability to act as an Encryption
                   Key; a Video, Voice, and Data Compression Protocol;
                   to allow a Program to have a variable length
                   defining a WORD in Assembler Language; change the
                   measurement(s) defining the dimensions and Format

                   replacement for the notation representing Hex
                   Enumeration. And just the impacts from this
                   short listing is enough to describle the
