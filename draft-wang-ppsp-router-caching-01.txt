Internet-Draft             router caching             October 25, 2010


1. Introduction

   Streaming media content delivery has become increasingly important
   because of the media content proliferation in many application areas
   such as education, medical treatment and entertainment. Generally
   these video streaming applications on the Internet have very high
   bandwidth requirements and the server endures a heavy burden.

   Proxy caching techniques prove to be a good approach to deliver text-
   based objects, but it faces many difficulties in delivering streaming
   media data due to much larger size of multimedia content and rigorous
   continuous delivery demand from clients. Currently, CDN (Content
   delivery network) and P2P (peer-to-peer) technology are two major
   methods to overcome the hurdles of high bandwidth requirements and
   heavy burden on the server. However, CDN servers are expensive to
   deploy and maintain, so the system has poor scalability.

   Generally speaking, although routers as basic network facilities are
   deployed everywhere on the Internet, they are not well applied in the
   streaming media scheme. Hence, we propose a distributed router
   caching method for video streaming. In our scheme, routers cache
   multimedia content with high popularity and respond clients' requests
   directly when cache hits. In this way, clients can get extremely
   small initial startup latency. Moreover, we propose CRCP (cooperative
   router caching protocol) to support more routers to participate in
   the streaming media scheme. With the cooperation of multiple routers,
   server loads can be greatly reduced and the total traffic over the
   backbone network can also be cut down.

2.2. Terminology

      Cache router: In our scheme, a router with cached multimedia data
      is called the cache router.

      Initial cache router: When a user request is intercepted by a
      cache router for the first time, this cache router is called the
      initial cache router.

      Cooperative cache routers: As mentioned before, the initial cache
      router intercepts a user request and if the initial cache router
      cannot find the block which user requested in its caching, the
      initial cache router will send the user request to the other cache
      routers. These cache routers are called cooperative cache routers.

      Source server: In our scheme, the source server is an original
      streaming server. It can deliver all of the multimedia data to the
      users.

      Buffer map: Buffer map is a data structure that indicates if
      multimedia data exist in a cache router.

3. Overview of Router Caching for Video Streaming

3.1. Router Caching based Architecture

   As mentioned before, routers with the capability of caching
   multimedia data are called cache routers. Generally, in our scheme,
   the cache routers which are one kind of peers in the P2P streaming
   systems are deployed in the edge of the Internet. These cache routers
   are directly connected to the clients, so they are the nearest ones
   to the users. Thus, the client perceived startup latency almost can
   be ignored and the user experience is greatly enhanced.

                                                                    |

    Figure 1 The architecture of streaming systems with caching routers

   The architecture of streaming scheme based on cache routers is shown
   in Figure 1. As can be seen from the architecture, these cache

Internet-Draft             router caching             October 25, 2010


   routers are directly connected to the clients. Consequently, the
   video data cached in these cache routers can be provided for the
   clients as soon as possible. Generally, the prefixes of popular
   videos are cached in these cache routers. As a result, initial
   startup latency can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, since all the
   cache routers can collaborate with each other to serve the clients,
   the server loads can also be cut down significantly.

3.2. Scheme Implementation

   Overall, there are four steps in our scheme and the details are
   described as follows.

   Step 1: In initial phase, a client sends connection request to a
   source server, and then the source server sends the playlist to the
   client. When the client receives the playlist from the source server,
   the user can choose his/her favorite video to play.

   Step 2: In data request phase, the client requests for the segments
   one by one. In our scheme, every video file is divided into some
   segments logically. Meanwhile every segment is divided into many
   blocks.

   Step 3: In cache searching phase, the cache router intercepts the
   user requests by the previous defined rules, and then the cache
   router will search blocks in its caching.

   Step 4: In cache cooperation phase, the initial cache router searches
   blocks in its cooperative cache routers by CRCP.

   Step 5: In server response phase, the source server sends those
   blocks that are not cached in all the cache routers to the client.

3.3. Scheme Key Technologies

   In this section, it presents with some key issues which should be
   settled in sec 3.2.

   1. Cache routers need to know which blocks are required by the client,
      so we should design a structure that can indicate the requirement
      of the client, namely buffer map.

   2. The router, as is well known, works in the network layer; now
      cache routers need to handle the services in the application layer.
      Therefore, we should design a new streaming protocol to support
      the cache routers to complete the above function.



Wang, et al            Expires April 25, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             router caching             October 25, 2010


   3. Usually, the routers cannot swap extra messages except routing
      table information; so we should devise a new protocol to support
      all the cache routers exchanging control messages among these
      cache routers with each other.

4. Protocol Design

4.1. Streaming Protocol

   There are two aspects in streaming protocol. One of them is a scheme
   of the control messages exchanged among the peers in the streaming
   system, and the other scheme is that how multimedia data are
   transmitted over the Internet. The streaming control protocol is a
   set of rules of exchanging control messages among the clients, the
   cache routers and the source server. In the protocol, we establish a
   mapping of the router caching, namely buffer map. Every segment has
   one buffer map in which every bit shows whether the relevant block
   exists or not in the cache router. The detail of the streaming
   protocol is shown as following.

   The workflow of the streaming protocol is shown in Figure 2 and the
   detail procedure is illustrated as follows.

   1. Build a connection between the client and the source server;

   2. A unique peer ID is assigned for the client by the source server;

   3. The client sends a request which includes a buffer map of a
      segment to the source server and the format of control message is
      explained later;

   4. The initial cache router captures the request by the method of DPI
      and gets the buffer map, and then the cache router can obtain the
      information about cache hit or cache miss;

   5. The initial cache router sends cached blocks in its caches to the
      client;

   6. The cache router updates the buffer map and sends the new buffer
      map to the source server;

   7. When the streaming server receives the new buffer map, it will
      send all the required blocks which are indicated in the new buffer
      map;

   8. After the client sends its request, it will receive blocks from
      the cache routers or the source server, but actually the client


Wang, et al            Expires April 25, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             router caching             October 25, 2010


      doesn't know where the blocks come from. In other words, the cache
      routers are transparent to the client.

   9. The client checks its buffer map periodically. If all the blocks
      in this segment have been received, the client will request for
      the next segment. Otherwise, the client sends the latest buffer
      map again.

   In the streaming control protocol, the control message is
   encapsulated into an IP packet as follows.

   | | +---------------------------------------------------|  | |
   | |                       IP Network                       | |

   | +--------------------------------------------------------+ |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+

   Type:
       The type field represents the type of this packet, indicating
       this message is from a client or a cooperative router.

   Peer ID:
       In the initial phase, the source server assigns a unique
       identifier for every client to manage all the clients.

   Video ID:
       Obviously, Video ID clearly shows that which video is being
        watched by the user.

   Buffer Map:
       This field is very important in the streaming protocol.
       This identifier is to indicate which blocks are required by
       client. Every segment has a buffer map, and the size of the
       buffer map is about 32 bytes. Every bit of the buffer map
       indicates whether this block is required or not.

   As aforementioned, the block is a basic unit cached in a cache router.
   The multimedia data are encapsulated into an IP packet as follows:

4.2. Cooperative Router Caching Protocol

   The cooperative router caching protocol is a supplement for the
   streaming protocol. The strategy in a cache router is different from
   the one in the streaming protocol. When a cache router updates the
   client's buffer map, it doesn't forward the new buffer map directly
   to the source server; instead the initial cache router firstly
   forwards the new buffer map to its cooperative cache routers. These
   cooperative cache routers will send feedbacks to the initial cache
   router. The initial cache router collects all the feedbacks from
   these cooperative cache routers and obtains the latest buffer map. At
   last, the initial cache router sends the latest buffer map to the
   source server. In this way, all the cooperative cache routers can
   serve the client together.

   The workflow of CRCP is shown in Figure 3 and the detail of CRCP is
   as follows.

   1. The initial cache router intercepts the user request by the rules
      previous defined;

   2. The initial cache router gets the buffer map in the user request;

   3. The buffer map is updated according to the caching scheme in the

   4. The hit blocks in the initial cache router are sent to the client.
      Meanwhile, the new buffer map is forwarded to the cooperative
      cache routers;

   5. When the cooperative cache routers receive the new buffer map,
      they do the same operations as the initial cache router does. In
      other words, the cooperative cache routers send hit blocks to the
      client and send feedbacks that indicate which blocks are cached in
      their caches to the initial cache router;

   6. After the initial cache router collects the feedbacks in a certain
      period time, it forms a latest buffer map and sends the latest
      buffer map to the source server;

5. Validation of Cooperative Router Caching Scheme

5.1. Overview

   We do some measurement and experiments in the prototype system to
   validate the cooperative router caching scheme. Hereby we present the
   numerical experiments that we have conducted to evaluate the
   performance of the scheme.

5.2. Experimental Evaluation

   We set up a streaming system based on cache routers. In the system,
   there are some cache routers, a number of clients and a single source
   server. All the cache routers are in the same autonomous domain, and
   they can cooperate with each other. In the prototype system, all the
   cache routers have the same hardware and software configuration:
   Intel Pentium D 2.80GHz, 1G memory; OS is Linux operating system, and
   the server is simulated by PC (Intel Core Dual-Core CPU, T5670
   1.80GHz, 2G RAM). The links between routers and clients are connected
   by the Ethernet. Below we show the experimental results as follows.

   1. average startup delay

   Parameters configurations:

   Server bandwidth B=4000KBps, cache ratio = 0.10

   User number                  100   200   300   400   500   600

   Average startup delay (s)

   With CRCP:                   13    14    15    18    18    22

   Without CRCP:                43    74    121   154   307   340

   Parameters configurations: User number N = 120, cache ratio R = 0.10

   Server bandwidth (KBps)       32   64   256   512   1024   2048

   Average startup delay (s)

   With router caching:          14   14    15    16    15     15

   Without router caching:       60   56    53    51    46     44

   When we introduce the router caching scheme in the streaming system,
   the average startup delay is always low in different scenarios; while
   if there is no caching scheme in the cache routers, the average
   startup delay increases sharply with the increase of user number.

   2. server bandwidth cost

   Parameters configurations: cache ratio R = 0.10

   User number                   100   200   300   400   500   600

   Server bandwidth cost (KBps)

   With router caching:          1024  1109  1331  1536  1689  1850

   Without router caching:       1231  1515  1588  1817  2053  2107

   Parameters configurations: user number N = 200

   Cache ratio of media file (%)  0.10  0.12  0.14  0.16  0.18  0.20

   Server bandwidth cost (KBps)

   With CRCP:                     1105  1017  927   849   703    452

   Without CRCP:                  1697   418  1387  1374  1258   1152

   In the first scenario, the bandwidth consumption of server is rising
   with the increase of concurrent users. Nevertheless, compared to the
   case of without router caching, the bandwidth consumption of server
   in the case of with router caching can be reduced by 10%. In the
   second scenario, if there is no CRCP in the scheme, the bandwidth
   cost of server is reduced from 1697KBps to 1152KBps (reduced by 32%);
   while in the case of with cooperative caching, the bandwidth cost of
   server is reduced from 1105KBps to 452KBps (reduced by 59%). It shows
   that the cache size has an important impact on the performance of the
   server.

   3. reduction of network traffic

   Parameters configurations:

   User number N = 200, server bandwidth B = 4000KBps

   Cache ratio of media file (%)  0.10  0.12  0.14  0.16  0.18  0.20

   Traffic reduction (%)

   With CRCP:                       5    25    39    53    65    71

   Without CRCP:                    3    18    25    28    35    42

   4. Overhead of cache routers' CPU

   Parameters configurations:

   User number N = 200, server bandwidth B = 4000KBps

   Cache ratio of media file (%) 0.10  0.12  0.14  0.16  0.18  0.20

   Overhead of CPU (%)

   With CRCP:                    1.3  1.3   1.3   1.3   1.3    1.3

   Without CRCP:                 1.3  1.3   1.25  1.2   1.2    1.2

   This part shows the extra usage of CPU due to running CRCP in cache
   routers. Anyway, only additional 1.3% of CPU has been occupied by
   running CRCP. In other words, the introduction of CRCP doesn't make
   the cache routers endure much more burden.

   Through the above measurement, the conclusion is:

   1. The scheme of cooperative router caching for streaming systems can
      reduce the initial startup delay greatly even with the increase of
      user number.

   2. The scheme proves to be an appropriate method in the streaming
      systems. When the cache ratio reaches to 0.20, more than half of
      the server bandwidth cost and the traffic over backbone network
      can also be prominently cut down.

6. PPSP Compatibility Considerations

   As we known, the objective of the PPSP work is to standardize the key
   signaling protocols among various P2P streaming system components
   including the tracker and the peers. Regarding to the components it
   involves, PPSP allows effective integration between the peer index
   servers named tracker and different kinds of peers including edge
   infrastructure nodes such as cache, gateway and CDN nodes who can act
   as super peers and ordinary peers. In our scheme, the cache routers
   can be one kind of super peers in the P2P streaming system.

   In P2P streaming system, a P2P cache refers to a network entity that
   caches P2P traffic in the network, and either transparently or

   explicitly as a peer distributes content to other peers. While in our
   scheme, edge routers cache popular video data in their caches and
   transparently provide contents for the clients. These edge routers
   can be considered as P2P caches in P2P streaming systems. Moreover,
   the proposed streaming protocol and CRCP work at the application
   layer. Therefore, the proposed scheme is fully compatible with PPSP.

7. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any new security issues.

8. IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9. Conclusions

   The router caching scheme is proposed for video streaming systems. By
   caching popular video contents on the cache routers in the edge of
   the Internet, the server load and the traffic transmission over the
   backbone network are greatly reduced and the user experience is
   improved significantly. Moreover, CRCP is proposed to enable the
   cache routers cooperation to further improve the performance of the
   streaming systems.

   Besides, the most important thing is that the cooperative router
   caching scheme can be well applied to the P2P streaming systems.
   Finally, if we pay more attention to the distributed cache storage
   and replacement policy, that would allow the system to gain more
   benefits from cooperative router caching scheme.
