          Controlling pre-standard coherent Optical Interfaces
                 draft-many-coherent-dwdm-if-control-00

Abstract

   Modulated optical interfaces with coherent detection receivers are in
   widespread use in Internet networking equipment.  Various
   implementations are in deployment since 2012 but there is no standard
   available defining those interfaces, nor their capabilities.  This
   document identifies the need for INFORMATIONAL work on control plane
   aspects pre-standard coherent optical DWDM applications.

1.  Introduction

   The dominant interconnection technology in the Internet is based on
   fiber and optical transceiver interfaces.  Multiple SDOs are working
   on control-plane and data-plane standards in this field.  Some are
   covering LAN applications (IEEE), while others work on WAN and in
   particular DWDM based applications (ITU-T SG15).  Those
   recommendations are based on non-coherent detection schemes.  DWDM
   wavelengths of 40Gb/s, 100Gb/s and beyond use higher order modulation
   techniques with coherent detection schemes and are used throughout
   the industry.  Current implementations are already heading towards
   capacities of 400Gb/s and 1Tb/s per Wavelength.  The gap between
   standards availability and practical deployment creates a mounting
   need in the industry for a common data model that can be used to
   control Pre Standard Coherent Optical (PRESCO) interfaces.  This
   document addresses the issue of progressing control plane work
   related to PRESCO-DWDM technology.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Abbreviations

   o  DWDM: Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing

   o  PRESCO-interface: PRE-Standard-Coherent-Optical DWDM interface

   o  PRESCO-wavelength: pre-standard coherent DWDM signal with phase
      modulated transmitter and coherent detection receiver

   o  PRESCO-Module: Transmitter/receiver Module of pre-standard
      coherent DWDM signals

   o  SDO: Standards Developing Organization

4.  Motivation

   As data plane standards for standard coherent optical interfaces are
   in flux, there is a lack of common ground on modeling and encoding
   interface parameters related to higher order modulation techniques
   with coherent detection schemes.  This unnecessarily burdens control
   systems with complexity in coping with incompatible implementations
   and complex operation.  As data plane standards are insufficient to
   provide guidance on control plane work for PRESCO devices, work on
   data models for PRESCO applications need to proceed independently of
   data plane standards.

5.  Applicability to CCAMP

   "The CCAMP working group is responsible for standardizing a common
   control plane and a separate common measurement plane for non-packet
   technologies found in the Internet and in the networks of telecom
   service providers (ISPs and SPs)."" As such CCAMP is chartered with
   "the definition of management objects (e.g., as part of MIB modules
   or YANG models) and control of OAM techniques relevant to the
   protocols and extensions specified within the WG" [ccamp-charter].
   Hence work to control PRESCO devices would fall in the scope of
   ccamp.

6.  State of Data Plane Standardization

   The first version of [superseded-ITU.G698.2] was published July 2007.
   A key role plays the concept of "application codes" to characterize
   transmitters and receivers using an character-string.  When a Tx/Rx
   pair, with the same code, is connected over a link with specific
   optical properties, the DWDM connection is guaranteed to interoperate
   regardless of their origin, i.e. their manufacturer within the
   conditions set out in this recommendation.

   The now in-force [ITU.G698.2] recommendation "includes unidirectional
   DWDM applications at 2.5 and 10 Gbit/s with 100 GHz channel frequency
   spacing as well as applications at 10 Gbit/s with 50 GHz channel
   frequency spacing."  No comparable Recommendation exists for higher
   bitrates and higher modulated signals and the current vesionof
   [RFC7581] is also based on those codes.  Also related standards like
   [ITU.G697] "Optical monitoring for dense wavelength division
   multiplexing systems" and [ITU.G680] "Physical transfer functions of
   optical network elements" are written based on 2.5G and 10G
   technology.

   ITU-T Study Group 15 set out in 2010 to begin work toward "revision
   of [SG15-2012], establishing sets of parameters and associated values
   to enable multi-vendor interoperability for 40 Gbit/s application
   codes with various modulation formats".  At the time this work began,
   there were several candidate modulation formats e.g DQPSK, PM-QPSK,
   OFDM-QPSK.  NRZ modulation used for 2.5G and 10G is simpler than the
   so called advanced phase modulation schemes required for higher
   bitrates.  For DP-QPSK, for example, it is necessary to determine and
   specify suitable parameters for the characterization of the
   polarization and phase components of the signal.  The challenge
   experts had in advancing that work has been brought to the attention
   of ccamp in 2013 when it was reported that progress have been made
   such that "there is only 1 modulation format candidate for 100G
   standardization" and "what we're struggling with is doing fundamental
   work on standardizing phase modulated
   transmission"[IETF-86-ccamp-minutes].

   We recognize the complex nature of the task and acknowledge the
   amount of diligent work that has been put, and is still being put
   into coherent DWDM data-plane standardization.  Still, at the time of
   this writing, the fundamental underlying problem in standardizing
   phase modulated optical signals is not yet solved.  Even when that
   work would be completed, the relevant aspects of the link and
   receiver, together with an appropriate FEC standardization, will need
   to be addressed as well.  By Sept 2016 there is no deadline
   communicated by when this work is expected to be finalized.

7.  Current state of Control Plane Standardization

   Standardization control aspects in relevant SDOs naturally follows
   the work on data plane which provides the base for monitoring
   capabilities and identification of critical parameters.  Available
   recommendations utilize application codes defined in [ITU.G698.2].
   Such application code can be considered a character based
   abbreviation (such as e.g.  DScW-ytz(v) from [ITU.G698.2]) to
   characterize transceiver characteristics.  Consequently control
   information in WSON (see [RFC3591] and [ITU.G874.1]) is also based on
   the use of such application codes.  [RFC3591] is based on [ITU.G872].
   and provides a starting point for the definition and structuring of
   objects.  However, given that [RFC3591] is also a standards track
   document, it naturally based on standard definitions and can not
   include parameters required to describe PRESCO devices.  In parallel,
   individual contributions in ccamp (e.g. [draft-2012]) were proposing
   to work based on those documents by introducing extensions for
   parameters describing PRESCO devices.  As data-plane standards did
   not conclude, such extensions were considered pre-mature.  So by
   Sept. 2016 no common reference model exists as a basis that would
   allow to define a data model for modulated optical interfaces with
   coherent detection receivers.

8.  Addressing the gap in controlling PRESCO-DWDM interfaces

   As the Industry is surpassing standards development in providing
   PRESCO applications, it would benefit from commonality in
   implementing yang data models to control PRESCO-DWDM Modules.
   Existing PRESCO Modules already provide extensive FCAPS capabilities
   and are used to provide commercial services.  Data models for such
   devices are in active development but suffer from commonality.  On
   the positive side this situation allows defining PRESCO related data
   models based on those FCAPS functionalities.

9.  Progressing PRESCO related work

   PRESCO related work should be based on creating a common abstracted
   model based on PRESCO-FCAPS implementations, rough consensus and
   running code.  The aim is provide the basis to enable PRESCO
   applications in a consistent manner by reducing implementation
   differences in the data structure.

   As PRESCO data models would need to evolve in parallel or even
   precede a data-plane standard the following list of considerations
   should be applied going forward:

   1.  Control work for PRESCO SHALL have the status INFORMATIONAL as it
       is not standards based



Grammel, et al.          Expires March 30, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          coherent-DWDM-if-control          September 2016


   2.  A PRESCO model SHOULD be based on control parameters available
       PRESCO DWDM modules

   3.  PRESCO modeling SHOULD aim to align with existing data models in
       IETF

   4.  PRESCO data models SHALL NOT mandate to implement all attributes
       defined but allow implementers to select

   5.  the model SHOULD allow augmentation of parameters by vendor
       specific extensions

   6.  the model SHOULD re-using existing standard parameter definitions
       and encoding where possible

   7.  Since the full set of parameters needed to characterize PRESCO
       modules and their encoding are undefined, application codes are
       not available for use in PRESCO and controlling PRESCO Modules
       SHALL NOT use application codes.

   8.  the accuracy of measurement values MAY depend on implementation.
       Hence a protocol SHOULD be able to trim measured values to a
       normal to make them comparable across implementations.

   9.  threshold levels derived from measurement values SHOULD be
       adjustable such that a comparable system behaviour can be
       achieved.

   PRESCO related work evidently needs to be separate from standards
   related work and we need to outline what PRESCO work is not about:

   o  PRESCO is NOT suggesting to perform data-plane work in IETF.

   o  PRESCO is NOT providing data models for non-PRESCO interfaces

   o  PRESCO does NOT propose to utilize Data models defined for PRESCO
      modules to be re-used for standard models when those become
      available

   o  PRESCO does NOT suppose multi-vendor compatibility of PRESCO-
      Modules on data plane.  I.e. a pair of PRESCO-DWDM interfaces
      having identical parameter sets describing the data-plane MAY not
      be compatible.

Appendix A.  Additional Stuff

   Parameters that need to be encoded addressing PRESCO applications
   are:

   o  Modulation Format

   o  Spectral efficiency or Bit per symbols

   o  baud rate
