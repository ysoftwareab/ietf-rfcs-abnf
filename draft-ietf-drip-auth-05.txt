    DRIP Authentication Formats & Protocols for Broadcast Remote ID
                        draft-ietf-drip-auth-05

Abstract

   This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM Remote ID
   specification defined in ASTM F3411 under Broadcast Remote ID (RID).
   It defines a few message schemes (sent within the Authentication
   Message) that can be used to authenticate past messages sent by a
   unmanned aircraft (UA) and provide proof of UA trustworthiness even
   in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node.

1.  Introduction

   Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are usually in a volatile environment
   when it comes to communication.  UA are generally small with little
   computational (or flying) horsepower to carry standard communication
   equipment.  This limits the mediums of communication to few viable
   options.

   Observer systems (e.g. smartphones and tablets) place further
   constraints on the communication options.  The Remote ID Broadcast
   messages MUST be available to applications on these platforms without
   modifying the devices.

   The ASTM [F3411] standard focuses on two ways of communicating to a
   UAS for Remote ID (RID): Broadcast and Network.

   This document will focus on adding trust to Broadcast RID via the
   Authentication Message by combining dynamically signed data with an
   Attestation of the UA's identity from a Registry.

1.1.  DRIP Requirements Addressed

   The following [drip-requirements] will be addressed:

   GEN 1: Provable Ownership  This will be addressed using the DRIP Link



Wiethuechter, et al.    Expires 8 September 2022                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                auth-formats                    March 2022


      and DRIP Wrapper or DRIP Manifest.

   GEN 2: Provable Binding  This requirement is addressed using the DRIP
      Wrapper or DRIP Manifest.

   GEN 3: Provable Registration  This requirement is addressed using the
      DRIP Link.

   See Section 7.3 for further clarification.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Required Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Definitions

   See [drip-requirements] for common DRIP terms.

   Aircraft:  In this document whenever the word Aircraft is used it is
      referring to an Unmanned Aircraft (UA) not a Manned Aircraft.

   Legacy Transports:  uses broadcast frames (Bluetooth 4.x).

   Extended Transports:  uses the extended advertisements (Bluetooth
      5.X), service info (Wi-Fi NaN) or vendor specific element
      information (Wi-Fi BEACON).  Must use ASTM [F3411] Message Pack
      (Message Type 0xF).

3.  Background

3.1.  Problem Space and Focus

   The current standard for Remote ID does not, in any meaningful
   capacity, address the concerns of trust in the UA space with
   communication in the Broadcast RID environment.  This is a
   requirement that will need to be addressed eventually for various
   different parties that have a stake in the UA industry.

3.2.  Reasoning for IETF DRIP Authentication

   The ASTM Authentication Message has provisions in [F3411] to allow
   for other organizations to standardize additional Authentication
   formats beyond those explicitly in [F3411].  The standardization of
   specific formats to support the DRIP requirements in UAS RID for
   trustworthy communications over Broadcast RID is an important part of
   the chain of trust for a UAS ID.  No existing formats (defined in
   [F3411] or other organizations leveraging this feature) provide the
   functionality to satisfy this goal resulting in the work reflected in
   this document.

3.3.  ASTM Authentication Message

   The ASTM Authentication Message (Message Type 0x2) is a unique
   message in the Broadcast [F3411] standard as it is the only one that
   is paged.

     Authentication Headers: (6 bytes)
         Contains other header information for the Authentication
         Message as defined in F3411.

     Authentication Data / Signature: (0 to 255 bytes)
         Opaque authentication data.

     Additional Data Length (ADL): (1 byte - unsigned)
         Length in bytes of Additional Data.

     Additional Data: (0 to 255 bytes):
         Data that follows the Authentication Data / Signature but
         is not considered part of the Authentication Data.

                Figure 2: ASTM Authentication Message Fields

   Figure 2 is the abstract view of the data fields found in the
   Authentication Message as defined by [F3411].  This data is placed
   into Figure 1's Authentication Payload, spanning multiple pages.

   When Additional Data is being sent, a single unsigned byte
   (Additional Data Length) directly follows the Authentication Data /
   Signature and has the length, in bytes, of the following Additional
   Data.  For DRIP, this field is used to carry Forward Error Correction
   as defined in Section 4.

   Full examples of Authentication Messages (fully paginated; both with
   and without Additional Data) can be found in Appendix C.

3.3.2.  DRIP Constraints

   To keep consistent formatting across the different transports (Legacy
   and Extended) and their independent restrictions the authentication
   data being sent is REQUIRED to fit within the page limit of the most
   constrained existing transport can support.  Under Broadcast RID the
   transport that can hold the least amount of authentication data is
   Bluetooth 5 and Wi-Fi BEACON at 9-pages.

   As such DRIP transmitters are REQUIRED to adhere to the following:

   1.  Authentication Data / Signature data MUST fit in a 9-page
       Authentication Message (Page Numbers 0 through 8).

   2.  The Length field in the Authentication Headers (which denotes the
       length in bytes of Authentication Data / Signature only) MUST NOT
       exceed the value of 201.

4.  Forward Error Correction

   For Broadcast RID, Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided by the
   lower layers in Extended Transports (Bluetooth 5.X, Wi-Fi NaN, and
   Wi-Fi BEACON).  Legacy Transports do not have supporting FEC so with
   DRIP Authentication the following application level FEC scheme is
   used.

4.1.  Encoding

   For any encoding the FEC data MUST start on new ASTM Authentication
   Page.  To do this null padding is add before the actual FEC data
   starts and the length of the whole blob (null padding and FEC) is
   used as the Additional Data Length.  To properly fit FEC data into an
   Authentication Page the number of parity-bytes is limited to 23 (or a
   multiple thereof).  This means that the Page Header (and anything
   before it) is omitted in the FEC process.

4.1.1.  Single Page FEC

   To generate the parity a simple XOR operation using the previous and
   current page is used.  Only the last 23-bytes are used during the XOR
   operation.  For Page 0, a 23-byte null pad is used for the previous
   page.  The resulting parity fills the Additional Data field of
   [F3411] with the Additional Data Length field being set to 23 or
   greater (depending on number of null pad bytes are needed to get onto
   the next page).

                 Figure 3: Example Single Page FEC Encoding

4.1.2.  Multiple Page FEC

   For Multiple Page FEC there are two flavors: Frame Recovery and Page
   Recovery.  Both follow a similar process, but are offset at what data
   is actually protected.

   (Editor Note: to improve interop should we explicitly select a
   polynomial for Reed Solomon that DRIP must use?)

4.1.2.1.  Page Recovery

   Take the following example of an Authentication Message that 3-pages
   of parity are to be generated for:

   For Page Recovery the first two columns are ignored (being the Page
   Header and any data before it), the last 23 columns are extracted and
   have Reed Solomon performed on it to produce parity bytes.  For the
   example the following 3-bytes of parity are generated:

   dc6c2b = ReedSolomon.encoder(0920ffdcf2713b)

   Each set of parity is the placed into a pseudo-frame as follows (each
   byte in its own message in the same column):

   0000dc00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   00006c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   00002b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   The above data set produces the following full set of parity:

   0000dc6657acd30b2ec4aa582049f52adf9f922e62c469563a
   00006c636a59145a55417a3895fd543f19e94200be4abc5e94
   000002bba5e28f5896d754caf50016a983993b149b5c9e6eeb

   The last 23-bytes are then added into the Additional Data field.

4.1.2.2.  Frame Recovery

   Frame Recovery uses the full ASTM Message and performs Reed Solomon
   over each byte.  Below is an example of a number of messages.

   Each column is extracted and has Reed Solomon performed on it to
   produce parity bytes.  In the below example 5-bytes of parity are
   generated with Frame Recovery:

   6c3f42b8a8 = ReedSolomon.encoder(101112121212121212131415)

   Each set of parity is the placed into a pseudo-frame as follows (each
   byte in its own message in the same column):

   6c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   a8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   The above data set produces the following sets of parity:

   a85bb403aada89926fb8fc2a14a9caacb4ec2f3a6ed2d8e9f9

   For Frame Recovery the above data would be placed into Authentication
   Pages like below:

   Page 7 = 12576c86337bf7ab746f5d62bb7f8de954104b121585d3975f
   Page 8 = 12586e923f06c1bce165b0e25930d57a63c24f751145e1dd8d

   Page 11 = 125b6f1831cd477ef3a3a85bb403aada89926fb8fc2a14a9ca
   Page 12 = 125cacb4ec2f3a6ed2d8e9f900000000000000000000000000

   Up to 240 (255 minus 15 pages max of FEC data) messages can be
   protected using Frame Recovery.

4.2.  Decoding

   Due to the nature of Bluetooth 4 and the existing ASTM paging
   structure an optimization can be used.  If a Bluetooth frame fails
   its CRC check, then the frame is dropped without notification to the
   upper protocol layers.  From the Remote ID perspective this means the
   loss of a complete frame/message/page.  In Authentication Messages,
   each page is already numbered so the loss of a page allows the
   receiving application to build a "dummy" page filling the entire page
   with nulls.

   If Page 0 is being reconstructed an additional check of the Last Page
   Index to check against how many pages are actually present, MUST be
   performed for sanity.  An additional check on the Length field SHOULD
   also be performed.

   To determine if Single Page FEC or Multiple Page FEC has been used a
   simple check of the Last Page Index can be used.  If the number of
   pages left after the Length of Authentication Data is exhausted than
   it is clear that the remaining pages are all FEC.  The Additional
   Data Length byte can further confirm this; taking into account any
   null padding needed for page alignment.

4.2.1.  Single Page FEC

   Using the same methods as encoding, an XOR operation is used between
   the previous and current page (a 23-byte null pad is used as the
   start).  The resulting 23-bytes should be data of the missing page.

4.2.2.  Multiple Page FEC

   To determine if Page Recovery or Frame Recovery is used two modulo
   checks with the ADL after the length of the null-pad is removed are
   needed.  One against the value of 23, and the other against the value
   of 25.  If 23 comes back with a value of 0 then Page Recovery is
   being used.  If 25 comes back with 0 then Frame Recovery is used.
   Any other combination indicates an error.

4.2.2.1.  Page Recovery

   To decode Page Recovery, dummy pages (pages with nulls as the data)
   are needed in the places no page was received.  Then Reed Solomon can
   decode across the columns of the 23-bytes of each page.  Erasures can
   be used as it is known which pages are missing and can improve the
   Reed Solomon results by specifying them.

4.2.2.2.  Frame Recovery

   To decode Frame Recovery, the receiver must first extract all FEC
   data from the pages; concatenate them and then break into 25-byte
   chunks.  This will produce the pseudo-frames.  Now Reed Solomon can
   be used to decode columns, with dummy frames inserted where needed.

4.3.  FEC Limitations

   The worst case scenario is when the Authentication Data / Signature
   ends perfectly on a page (Page N-1).  This means the Additional Data
   Length would start the next page (Page N) and have 22-bytes worth of
   null padding to align the FEC in to the next page (Page N+1).  In
   this scenario an entire page (Page N) is being wasted just to carry
   the Additional Data Length.  This should be be avoided at all costs -
   in an effort to maintain efficiency.

5.  Broadcast Attestation Structure

   To directly support Broadcast RID a variation of the Attestation
   Structure format of [drip-registries] SHOULD be used when running
   DRIP under the various Authentication Types (filling the
   Authentication Data / Signature field of Figure 2) and SAM Types
   (filling the SAM Authentication Data field (Section 6.3.1.2)).  The
   notable changes of the structure is that the timestamps are set by
   the UA and the Attestor Identity Information is set to the DET of the
   UA.

   When using this structure the UA is always self-attesting its DRIP
   Entity Tag (DET).  The Host Identity of the UA DET can be looked up
   by mechanisms described in [drip-registries] or by extracting it from
   Broadcast Attestation (see Section 6.3.2 and Section 7.3).

     UA DRIP Entity Tag (16 bytes):
         The UA DET in byte form (network byte order).

     Attestation Data (0 to 112 bytes):
         Opaque attestation data.

     Not Before Timestamp by UA (4-bytes):
         Timestamp denoting recommended time to start trusting data.

     Not After Timestamp by UA (4 bytes):
         Timestamp denoting recommended time to stop trusting data.

     UA Signature (64 bytes):
         Signature over preceding fields using the keypair of
         the UA.

                 Figure 4: Broadcast Attestation Structure

   Attestation Data is a field with a maximum of 112-bytes, containing
   data that the UA is attesting during its flight.

   The Not After Timestamp and Not Before Timestamp MUST follow the
   format defined in [F3411].  That is a UNIX timestamp offset by
   01/01/2019 00:00:00.  Not Before Timestamp MUST be set to the time
   the structure is signed over.  An additional offset is then added to
   push the Not After Timestamp a short time into the future to avoid
   replay attacks.  The offset used against the UNIX timestamp is not
   defined in this document.  Best practice identifying an acceptable
   offset should be used taking into consideration the UA environment,
   and propagation characteristics of the messages being sent and clock
   differences between the UA and Observers.  A reasonable time would be
   to set Not After Timestamp 2 minutes ahead of Not Before Timestamp.

   The concatenation of all messages in the Message Pack (excluding
   Authentication) before signing MUST be in Message Type order and be
   placed between the UA DRIP Entity Tag and Not Before Timestamp field.

6.3.2.1.  Link Limitations

   See Section 10.2 for details on why this structure is not dynamically
   signed.

6.3.3.  DRIP Wrapper

   This SAM Type is used to wrap and sign over a list of other [F3411]
   Broadcast RID messages.  It MUST use the Broadcast Attestation
   Structure (Section 5).

   The Attestation Data field is filled with full (25-byte) [F3411]
   Broadcast RID messages.  The minimum number being 1 and the maximum
   being 4.  The encapsulated messages MUST be in Message Type order as
   defined by [F3411].  All message types except Authentication (Message
   Type 0x2) and Message Pack (Message Type 0xF) are allowed.

   To determine the number of messages wrapped the receiver can check
   that the length of the Attestation Data field of the DRIP Broadcast
   Attestation (Section 5) is a multiple of 25-bytes.

         Signature over preceding fields using the keypair of
         the UA.

                  Figure 9: Example 4-Message DRIP Wrapper

6.3.3.1.  Wrapper Limitations

   The primary limitation of the Wrapper format is the bounding of up to
   4 ASTM Messages that can be sent within it.  Another limitation is
   that the format can not be used as a surrogate for messages it is
   wrapping.  This is due to high potential a receiver on the ground
   does not support DRIP.  Thus when Wrapper is being used the wrapper
   data must effectively be sent twice; once as a single framed message
   (as specified in [F3411]) and then again wrapped within the Wrapper
   format.

6.3.4.  DRIP Manifest

   This SAM Type is used to create message manifests.  It MUST use the
   Broadcast Attestation Structure (Section 5).

   By hashing previously sent messages and signing them we gain trust in
   UAs previous reports.  An observer who has been listening for any
   considerable length of time can hash received messages and cross-
   check against listed hashes.  This is a way to evade the limitation
   of a maximum of 4 messages in the Wrapper Format and reduce overhead.

   The Attestation Data field is filled with 12-byte hashes of previous
   [F3411] Broadcast messages.  A receiver does not need to have
   received every message in the manifest to verify it.  A manifest
   SHOULD typically encompass a single transmission cycle of messages
   being sent, see Section 7.4.

6.3.4.1.  Hash Algorithms and Operation

   The hash algorithm used for the Manifest Message is the same hash
   algorithm used in creation of the HHIT that is signing the Manifest.

   An HHIT using cSHAKE128 [NIST.SP.800-185] computes the hash as
   follows:

   cSHAKE128(ASTM Message, 96, "", "Remote ID Auth Hash")

         Note: [drip-rid] specifies cSHAKE128 but is open for the
         expansion of other OGAs.

6.3.4.1.1.  Legacy Transport Hashing

   Under this transport DRIP hashes the full ASTM Message being sent
   over the Bluetooth Advertising frame.  For Authentication Messages
   all the Authentication Message Pages are concatenated together and
   hashed as one object.  For all other Message Types the 25-byte
   message is hashed.

6.3.4.1.2.  Extended Transport Hashing

   Under this transport DRIP hashes the full ASTM Message Pack (Message
   Type 0xF) - regardless of its content.

6.3.4.2.  Pseudo-Blockchain Hashes

   Two special hashes are included in all Manifest messages; a previous
   manifest hash, which links to the previous manifest message, as well
   as a current manifest hash.  This gives a pseudo-blockchain
   provenance to the manifest message that could be traced back if the
   observer was present for extended periods of time.

   Creation:  During creation and signing of this message format this
      field MUST be set to 0.  So the signature will be based on this
      field being 0, as well as its own hash.  It is an open question of
      if we compute the hash, then sign or sign then compute.

   Cycling:  There a few different ways to cycle this message.  We can
      "roll up" the hash of 'current' to 'previous' when needed or to
      completely recompute the hash.  This mostly depends on the
      previous note.

6.3.4.3.  Manifest Limitations

   A potential limitation to this format is dwell time of the UA.  If
   the UA is not sticking to a general area then most likely the
   Observer will not obtain many (if not all) of the messages in the
   manifest.  Examples of such scenarios include delivery or survey UA.

   Another limitation is the length of hash, which is discussed in
   Section 10.1.

6.3.5.  DRIP Frame

   This SAM Type is for when the authentication data does not fit in
   other defined formats under DRIP and is reserved for future expansion
   under DRIP if required.  This SAM Type SHOULD use the Broadcast
   Attestation Structure (Section 5).

7.  Requirements & Recommendations

7.1.  Legacy Transports

   With Legacy Advertisements the goal is to attempt to bring reliable
   receipt of the paged Authentication Message.  Forward Error
   Correction (Section 4) MUST be used when using Legacy Advertising
   methods (such as Bluetooth 4.X).

   Under ASTM Bluetooth 4.X rules, transmission of dynamic messages are
   at least every 1 second.  DRIP Authentication Messages typically
   contain dynamic data (such as the DRIP Manifest or DRIP Wrapper) and
   must be sent at the dynamic rate of 1 per second.

7.2.  Extended Transports

   Under the ASTM specification, Bluetooth 5.X Wi-Fi NaN, and Wi-Fi
   BEACON transport of Remote ID is to use the Message Pack (Message
   Type 0xF) format for all transmissions.  Under Message Pack messages
   are sent together (in Message Type order) in a single Bluetooth 5
   extended frame (up to 9 single frame equivalent messages under
   Bluetooth 4.X).  Message Packs are required by ASTM to be sent at a
   rate of 1 per second (like dynamic messages).

   Without any fragmentation or loss of pages with transmission Forward
   Error Correction (Section 4) MUST NOT be used as it is impractical.

7.3.  Authentication

   It is REQUIRED that an aircraft send the following Authentication
   Formats to fulfill the [drip-requirements]:

   1.  DRIP Link using the Broadcast Attestation of HDA and the UA
       (satisfying GEN-1 and GEN-3)

   2.  Any other DRIP Authentication Format (RECOMMENDED: DRIP Manifest
       or DRIP Wrapper) where the UA is dynamically signing data
       (satisfying GEN-1 and GEN-2)

   It is RECOMMENDED the following set of Authentication Formats are
   sent for support of offline Observers:

   1.  DRIP Link using the Broadcast Attestation of HID Root and the RAA
       (CAA) (satisfies GEN-3)

   2.  DRIP Link using the Broadcast Attestation of RAA (CAA) and the
       HDA (USS) (satisfies GEN-3)

   3.  DRIP Link using the Broadcast Attestation of HDA (USS) and the UA
       (satisfies GEN-1 and GEN-3)

   4.  Any other DRIP Authentication Format (RECOMMENDED: DRIP Manifest
       or DRIP Wrapper) where the UA is dynamically signing data
       (satisfies GEN-1 and GEN-2)

7.4.  Operational

   UAS operation may impact the frequency of sending DRIP Authentication
   messages.  Where a UA is dwelling in one location, and the channel is
   heavily used by other devices, "occasional" message authentication
   may be sufficient for an observer.  Contrast this with a UA
   traversing an area, and then every message should be authenticated as
   soon as possible for greatest success as viewed by the receiver.

   Thus how/when these DRIP authentication messages are sent is up to
   each implementation.  Further complication comes in contrasting
   Legacy and Extended Transports.  In Legacy, each message is a
   separate hash within the Manifest.  So, again in dwelling, may lean
   toward occasional message authentication.  In Extended Transports,
   the hash is over the Message Pack so only few hashes need to be in a
   Manifest.  A single Manifest can handle a potential two Message Packs
   (for a full set of messages) and a DRIP Link Authentication Message
   for the HDA UA assertion.

Internet-Draft                auth-formats                    March 2022


   A separate issue is the frequency of transmitting the DRIP Link
   Authentication Message for the HDA UA assertion when using a Manifest
   Message.  This message content is static; its hash never changes
   radically.  The only change is the 4-byte timestamp in the
   Authentication Message headers.  Thus, potentially, in a dwelling
   operation it can be sent once per minute, where its hash is in every
   Manifest.  A receiver can cache all DRIP Link Authentication Message
   for the HDA UA assertion to mitigate potential packet loss.

   The preferred mode of operation is to send the HDA UA assertion every
   3 seconds and Manifest messages immediately after a set of UA
   operation messages (e.g.  Basic, Location, and System messages).

7.4.1.  DRIP Wrapper

   The DRIP Wrapper MUST NOT be used in place of sending the ASTM
   messages as is.  All receivers MUST be able to process all the
   messages specified in [F3411].  Only sending them within the DRIP
   Wrapper will make them opaque to receivers lacking support for DRIP
   authentication messages.  Thus messages within a Wrapper are sent
   twice: in the clear, and authenticated within the Wrapper.  The DRIP
   Manifest format would seem to be a more efficient use of the
   transport channel.

   The DRIP Wrapper has a specific use case for DRIP aware receivers.
   For receiver plotting received Location Messages (Message Type 0x2)
   on a map display an embedded Location Message in a DRIP Wrapper can
   be colored differently to signify trust in the Location data - be it
   current or previous Location reports that are wrapped.

8.  ICAO Considerations

   DRIP requests the following SAM Type's to be allocated:

   1.  DRIP Link

   2.  DRIP Wrapper

   3.  DRIP Manifest

   4.  DRIP Frame

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a new number field for Frame Type with initial
   values as defined in Section 6.3.5.1.

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Manifest Hash Length

   For DRIP Manifest an 12-byte hash length has been selected by the
   authors for a number of reasons.

   1.  Hash lengths smaller than 8-bytes (for example 4-bytes) were
       originally contemplated but ruled out by comments by various
       cryptographers.  The main concern raised in this forum was that
       the length of hash would not provide strong resistance against
       collision rate.  The authors also after further review agreed
       with this and also realized operationally it was not necessarily
       viable.  While 4-byte hashes would allow more messages to be
       filled into a single DRIP Manifest payload (up to 22 individual
       hashes) the length of time for the UA to stay in a single place
       where the Observer would receive all the originally messages to
       rehash to verify such a message was impractical.

   2.  Hash lengths larger than 8-bytes (for example 12 or 16-bytes)
       were also considered by the authors.  These got the approval of
       the cryptographers but the number of hashes to send became much
       lower (only 5 individual hashes).  While this lower number is a
       more reasonable number of original messages the Observer would
       have to capture it would also mean that potentially more DRIP
       Manifests would need to be sent.  Overall the increase length of
       the hash did not operationally justify the cost.

   3.  Simplifying the current design and locking it into using the same
       hash as the HHIT instead of allowing for agility in either hash
       algorithm or length seemed more realistic to the authors today.

10.2.  Replay Attacks

   The astute reader may note that the DRIP Link messages, which are
   recommended to be sent, are static in nature and contain various
   timestamps.  These Attestation Link messages can easily be replayed
   by an attacker who has copied them from previous broadcasts.  There
   are two things to mitigate this in DRIP:

   1.  If an attacker (who is smart and spoofs more than just the UAS
       ID/data payloads) willing replays an Attestation Link message
       they have in principle actually helped by ensuring the message is
       sent more frequently and be received by potential Observers.

   2.  It is RECOMMENDED to send more than just DRIP Link messages,
       specifically those that sign over changing data using the current
       session keypair, and those messages are sent more frequently.  An

Internet-Draft                auth-formats                    March 2022


       aircraft beaconing these messages then actually signing other
       messages using the keypair validates the data receiver by an
       Observer.  An UA who does not either run DRIP themselves or does
       not have possession of the same private key, would be clearly
       exposed upon signature verification.

10.3.  Trust Timestamp Offsets

   Note the discussion of Trust Timestamp Offsets here is in context of
   the DRIP Wrapper (Section 6.3.3) and DRIP Manifest (Section 6.3.4)
   messages.  For DRIP Link (Section 6.3.2) messages these offsets are
   set by the Attestor (typically a registry) and have their own set of
   considerations as seen in [drip-registries].

   The offset of the Trust Timestamp (defined as a very short Expiration
   Timestamp) is one that needs careful consideration for any
   implementation.  The offset should be shorter than any given flight
   duration (typically less than an hour) but be long enough to be
   received and processed by Observers (larger than a few seconds).  It
   recommended that 3-5 minutes should be sufficient to serve this
   purpose in any scenario, but is not limited by design.

   prototyping to find holes in the draft specifications.

   Soren Friis for pointing out that Wi-Fi implementations would not
   always give access to the MAC Address, originally used in calculation
   of the hashes for DRIP Manifest.  Also, for confirming that Message
   Packs (0xF) can only carry up to 9 ASTM frames worth of data (9
   Authentication pages) - this drove the requirement for max page
   length of Authentication Data itself.

Appendix D.  Example TX/RX Flow

   In this example the UA is sending all DRIP Authentication Message
   formats (DRIP Link, DRIP Wrapper and DRIP Manifest) during flight,
   along with standard ASTM Messages.  The objective is to show the
   combinations of messages that must be received to properly validate a
   DRIP equipped aircraft and examples of their various states
   (Appendix A).

   As the above example shows to properly authenticate both a DRIP Link
   and a DRIP Wrapper or DRIP Manifest are required.
