Abstract

   This document extends the base definition of ABNF (Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form) to include comprehensive support for certain symbols,
   namely the C0 control characters in ASCII.

Internet-Draft              More Core Rules                 October 2015


1.  Comprehensive Core Rule Update

   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] is a formal syntax that
   is popular among many Internet specifications. Many Internet
   documents employ this syntax along with the Core Rules defined in
   Appendix B.1 of [RFC5234]. However, the Core Rules do not specify
   many symbols in the ASCII range that are also needed by these relying
   documents, forcing document authors to define them as local rules.
   Sometimes different documents define these common symbols in
   different ways, resulting in confusion or incompatibility when the
   rules are misread or are combined with other sets of rules. This
   document extends [RFC5234] to include comprehensive support for
   certain symbols, namely the C0 control characters in [ASCII86], which
   for purposes of this document is equivalent to [RFC0020].

   Appendix A of this document is meant as a drop-in replacement for
   Appendix B.1 of [RFC5234]. I.e., these Core Rules are no more or less
   useful or normative than those in [RFC5234]. Future document authors
   should use these rules, and should not attempt to redefine or augment
   them (except for backwards compatibility with prior documents).

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document implies no IANA considerations.

3.  Security Considerations

   Security is truly believed to be irrelevant to this document.

4.  Normative References

              -- 7-bit American Standard Code for Information
              Interchange", ANSI X3.4, 1986.

Internet-Draft              More Core Rules                 October 2015


Appendix A.  Comprehensive Core Rules

   Certain basic rules are in uppercase, such as SP, HTAB, CRLF, DIGIT,
   ALPHA, etc.

         ALPHA          =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z

         BIT            =  "0" / "1"

         CHAR           =  %x01-7F
                                ; any 7-bit US-ASCII character,
                                ;  excluding NUL

         CR             =  %x0D

         CRLF           =  CR LF

         DIGIT          =  %x30-39

         DQUOTE         =  %x22
                                ; " (Double Quote)

         HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

         HTAB           =  %x09
                                ; horizontal tab

         LF             =  %x0A
                                ; linefeed

         LWSP           =  *(WSP / CRLF WSP)
                                ; Use of this linear-white-space rule
                                ;  permits lines containing only white
                                ;  space that are no longer legal in
                                ;  mail headers and have caused
                                ;  interoperability problems in other
                                ;  contexts.
                                ; Do not use when defining mail
                                ;  headers and use with caution in
                                ;  other contexts.
