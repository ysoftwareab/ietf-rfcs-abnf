C  = (TSecr >> local mask) - (TSval >> remote mask) * -----------------
  t                                                    local clock rate

   V(t) = C(t) - C(t-1)

   The adjustment factor can be calculated once during the timestamp
   capability negotiation phase, and pure integer arithmetic can be used
   during per-segment processing:
   EXP.min = min(EXP.loc, EXP.rem)

   EXP.rem -= EXP.min

   EXP.loc -= EXP.min

   FRAC.rem = (0x800 | FRAC.rem) << EXP.rem

   FRAC.loc = (0x800 | FRAC.loc) << EXP.loc

   and assuming that the local clock rate (tick duration) is lower

ADJ = FRAC.rem / FRAC.loc
