1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol [RFC4566] describes multimedia
   sessions for the purpose of session announcement and initiation.

   The Session-Description and Session-Media headers may be used for
   either a HTTP request or response and may be included as part of any
   HTTP method.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Session-Description Header

   The Session-Description header field conveys the entire session
   description information, using [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] to
   describe the structure.  Its value MUST be a dictionary containing
   containing only the following keys, receivers MUST ignore all other
   values.  Dictionary keys MUST be ordered in the order presented in
   this document, but MAY be omitted where they are explicitly declared
   as OPTIONAL.

2.1.  Session Description

   v  The version, represented as an sh-integer that MUST be set 0.
   o  The originator of the session, whose value is an sh-list.  The
      order of values present in the list MUST map to the order
      specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC4566].
   s  The name of the SDP, whose values is a string and MUST NOT be
      empty.
   i  An OPTIONAL description of the session, whose value is a string.
   u  An OPTIONAL URI reference containing additional information about
      the session, whose value is a string and SHOULD be represented as
      [RFC3986].
   e  An OPTIONAL email address, whose value is a string and SHOULD be
      represented using [RFC5322] address semantics.
   p  An OPTIONAL phone number whose value is a string, which SHOULD be
      represented as [E.164].
   c  An OPTIONAL field containing connection data, whose value is an
      inner-list, and whose elements are each a string type matching the
      order of elements as defined in Section 5.7 of [RFC4566].  This
      field MUST be set if no media entities in the description contain
      connection information.
   b  An OPTIONAL field containing the proposed bandwidth to be used by
      the session, whose value is an inner-list with only two elements,
      the first being a string type whose value corresponds to a
      "bwtype" as listed in the IANA registry, or a string prefixed "X-"
      to denote an experiemental value.  The second element is an
      integer type and MUST NOT be negative.
   k  An OPTIONAL field containing encryption key information, whose
      field is an inner-list containing up to two elements.  The first
      element

2.1.1.  Time Description

   All values within time description fields that represent wall time
   MUST be values shown as integers which represent NTP timestamps with
   second resolution.  To facilitate ease of parsing, fields that are
   used to represet a time duration or offset as described in
   Section 5.10 of [RFC4566] MUST NOT use the compact version e.g "1h"
   instead of "3600".

   t  An OPTIONAL field containing the start and end times of the
      session, whose value is an inner-list containing two elements -
      the first being the wall time start time, and the latter being the
      stopping time.
   r  An OPTIONAL field containing the repeat times, whose value is an
      inner-list containing three elements.  The first element contains
      the repeat interval whose value is an integer, and the second
      element containing the active duration whose value is an integer.
      The third element of the offsets from start-time whose value is an
      inner-list containing two elements containing integer values
      representing the offsets.
   z  An OPTIONAL field containing time zone adjustment information,
      whose value is an inner-list containing elements where each is an
      inner-list with two elements; the first element being an integer
      representing the wall time which the adjustment should take place,
      and the second element whose value is an integer representing the
      offset.
   a  An OPTIONAL field containing session-level attributes, whose value
      is an inner-list.  Each element may either be a sh-dictionary when
      representing a value attribute, or a string where it is a property
      attribute.  For value attributes, the contents MUST be a single
      name/value pair with the name being the attribute name, and the
      value as a string.

2.2.  The Session-Media Header

   The Session-Media header describes each media element within the
   session, and at the top level is an sh-list.

   Each media representation may additionally contain a media title (i),
   connection information (c), bandwidth (b), or encryption key (k).

2.3.  Implementation Considerations

   The Session-Description header MAY be sent at the same time in a
   response with a HTTP body that also contains the SDP payload for
   backwards compatibility.  In such case the values of the header MUST
   be identical in semantic meaning to the body payload and not include
   additional information or redaction.  It may also, dependant on

   implementation be sent in response to a HEAD request - in such cases
   the body MUST be omitted but the server MUST also send the
   "application/sdp" "Content-Type" HTTP header.

   to considerations raised in the structured header draft.
