Abstract

   Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle,
   plug into any point in the processing of an email message.  As
   defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This
   document defines how Sieve can plug into points in the IMAP protocol
   where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user-
   defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions,
   features such as notifications).

1.  Introduction

1.1  Overview

   Some applications have a need to apply [Sieve] filters in situations
   other than initial mail delivery.  This is especially true in diverse
   service environments, such as when the client is sporadically
   connected, is connected through a high-latency or high-cost channel,
   or is on a limited-function device.  For such clients, it may be very
   important, for higher performance and reliability, to take advantage
   of server capabilities, including those provided by Sieve filtering
   (and Sieve extensions, such as [Notify]).

   This specification defines extensions to [IMAP] to support the
   invocation of Sieve scripts at times when the IMAP server creates new
   messages, or modifies existing ones.  It also defines how Sieve
   scripts will process these invocations.

1.2  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in [Keywds].

2.  The IMAP "IMAPSieve" Extension

2.1  The "IMAPSieve" Capability String

   An IMAP server advertises support for this extension through the
   capability string "IMAPSieve" (the string is not case-sensitive, and
   is shown here with this capitalization for readability).  A server
   that advertises IMAPSieve is claiming to be in compliance with this
   specification in all aspects.

2.2  Existing IMAP Functions Affected by IMAPSieve

   The subsections below describe in detail the IMAP commands and
   situations on which IMAPSieve has an effect.  Not all Sieve actions
   make sense in the case of messages affected by IMAP commands.  See
   Section 3 for details.

   If more than one message is affected at the same time, each message
   triggers the execution of a Sieve script separately.  The scripts MAY
   be run in parallel.

2.2.1  The IMAP APPEND Command

   A message may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP APPEND command.
   In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, new messages added in this way
   MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script, subject to the settings
   specified with the SIEVEFILTER command (see Section 2.3.1).

2.2.2  The IMAP MULTIAPPEND Command

   If the IMAP server supports the IMAP [MultiAppend] extension,
   messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP MULTIAPPEND
   command.  In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, new messages added
   in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script, as with the
   APPEND command, also subject to the settings specified with the
   SIEVEFILTER command.

2.2.3  The IMAP COPY Command

   One or more messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP COPY
   command.  In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, new messages added
   in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script, subject to
   the settings specified with the SIEVEFILTER command.

2.2.4  Changes to IMAP Message Flags

   One or more existing messages can have their flags changed in a
   number of ways, including:



Leiba                     Expires June 21, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               Lemonade-Sieve                December 2005


   o  The FETCH command (may cause the \Seen flag to be set).

   o  The STORE command (may cause the \Answered, \Deleted, \Draft,
      \Flagged, and \Seen flags to be set or reset, and may cause
      keywords to be set or reset).

   o  The invocation of a Sieve script on an existing message, where the
      Sieve implementation supports the [IMAP4Flags] extension and the
      script uses one of the actions defined in that extension.

   o  [[Flags-Others?: Are there other ways?]]

   In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, messages whose flags are
   changed in any way (except as explained in the next sentence) MUST
   trigger the execution of a Sieve script, subject to the settings
   specified with the SIEVEFILTER command.  The exception is that in
   order to avoid script loops, flag changes that are made as a result
   of a script that was itself invoked because of flag changes SHOULD
   NOT result in another script invocation.  In any case,
   implementations MUST take steps to avoid such loops.

2.2.5  New or Changed IMAP Message Annotations

   [[Annotate?: Do we want this to apply to annotate too?  If so, does
   that make annotate a normative reference?]]

   If the IMAP server supports the [Annotate] extension, one or more
   existing messages can have annotations added or changed through the
   ANNOTATE command.  In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, messages
   getting new or changed annotations MUST trigger the execution of a
   Sieve script, subject to the settings specified with the SIEVEFILTER
   command.

2.3  New IMAP Functions Defined by IMAPSieve

2.3.1  The IMAP SIEVEFILTER Command

   [[Do we need this?: I'm not sure whether we need this command, but
   I've put it here as a placeholder, and to start discussion.  It may
   be that it's OK for all modifications to result in calls to the a
   Sieve filter, to have the filter designated elsewhere, and to have
   the filter decide what to handle and what to ignore.]]

   The SIEVEFILTER command is a command that we might need in order to
   tell the IMAP server which script to use for which mailbox(es).  If
   we decide we need this, the idea would be that no Sieve script is
   invoked unless this command sets it up, and the command would "turn
   on" filtering for a particular mailbox, or set of mailboxes.

3.  Applicable Sieve Actions and Interactions

   Since some Sieve actions relate specifically to the delivery of mail,
   not all actions make sense when the messages are created by other
   means, or when changes are made to data associated with existing
   messages.  This section describes how actions in the base Sieve
   specification, and those in extensions known at this writing, relate
   to this specification.

   In addition to what is specified here, interactions specified in the
   individual specifications apply, and must be considered.

3.1  The Implicit Keep

   For all cases that fall under IMAPSieve, the implicit keep means that
   the message is treated as it would have been if no Sieve script were
   run.  For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND and COPY, the message is stored into
   the target mailbox normally.  For flag or annotation changes, the
   message is left in the mailbox.

3.2  The Keep Action

   The keep action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.
   Its behaviour is as described for implicit keep, in Section 3.1.

3.3  The Fileinto Action

   If the Sieve implementation supports the fileinto action, that action
   is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.  If the [Copy]
   extension is available and the :copy option is specified, the
   implicit keep is retained; otherwise, fileinto cancels the implicit
   keep, as specified in the base Sieve specification.

   If a keep action, implicit or explicit, is also in effect, for
   APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is stored into the
   fileinto mailbox IN ADDITION TO the original target mailbox.  For
   flag or annotation changes, the message is COPIED into the fileinto
   mailbox, without removing the original.

   If a keep action is NOT also in effect, for APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and
   COPY, the message is stored into the fileinto mailbox INSTEAD OF in
   the original target mailbox.  For flag or annotation changes, the
   message is MOVED, as an atomic operation, into the fileinto mailbox.
   This MUST happen as an atomic operation, and MUST NOT be done by
   copying the message and setting the \Deleted flag for the original.

Internet-Draft               Lemonade-Sieve                December 2005


3.4  The Redirect Action

   The redirect action is applicable in all cases that fall under
   IMAPSieve.  It causes the message to be sent, as specified in the
   base Sieve specification, to the designated address.  If the [Copy]
   extension is available and the :copy option is specified, the
   implicit keep is retained; otherwise, redirect cancels the implicit
   keep, as specified in the base Sieve specification.

   If a keep action, implicit or explicit, is also in effect, for
   APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is stored into the target
   mailbox in addition to being redirected.  For flag or annotation
   changes, the message remains in its original mailbox.

   If a keep action is NOT also in effect, for APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and
   COPY, the message is NOT stored into the target mailbox.  For flag or
   annotation changes, the message is REMOVED, as an atomic operation,
   from the mailbox.  This MUST happen as an atomic operation, and MUST
   NOT be done by setting the \Deleted flag for the message.

3.5  The Reject Action

   The reject action is NOT applicable to any case that falls under
   IMAPSieve.  Its use MUST result in an error condition that will
   terminate the Sieve script.

3.6  The Discard Action

   The discard action is applicable in all cases that fall under
   IMAPSieve.  If a keep action, implicit or explicit, is also in
   effect, the discard action does nothing.  Otherwise, for APPEND,
   MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is NOT stored into the target
   mailbox.  For flag or annotation changes, the message is REMOVED, as
   an atomic operation, from the mailbox.  This MUST happen as an atomic
   operation, and MUST NOT be done by setting the \Deleted flag for the
   message.

3.7  The Notify Action

   If the [Notify] extension is available, the notify action is
   applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.  The result is
   that the requested notification is sent, and that the message is
   otherwise handled as it would normally have been.

3.8  The Addheader and Deleteheader Actions

   If the [EditHeader] extension is available, the addheader and
   deleteheader actions are applicable for NEW MESSAGES ONLY (messages



Leiba                     Expires June 21, 2006                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               Lemonade-Sieve                December 2005


   created by APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY).  The requested header
   changes are made to the new message before it is stored into the
   target mailbox.

   Since messages in IMAP mailboxes are immutable, these actions are NOT
   applicable in the case of flag or annotation changes to existing
   messages.  If a script uses addheader or deleteheader in these cases,
   the action MUST have no effect (and MUST NOT generate an error
   condition).
   [[editheader No Effect?: Is this what we want, or should it be an
   error?]]

3.9  The Setflag, Deleteflag, and Removeflag Actions

   If the [IMAP4Flags] extension is available, the actions associated
   with it are all applicable to any case that falls under IMAPSieve.
   It is worth noting also that the "hasflag" test that is defined in
   the IMAP4Flags extension might be particularly useful in scripts
   triggered by flag changes.

   As explained above, in order to avoid script loops flag changes that
   are made as a result of a script that was itself invoked because of
   flag changes SHOULD NOT result in another script invocation.  In any
   case, implementations MUST take steps to avoid such loops.

3.10  The Vacation Action

   Even if the [Vacation] extension is available, the vacation action is
   NOT applicable to any case that falls under IMAPSieve.  Its use MUST
   result in an error condition that will terminate the Sieve script.

3.11  New Sieve Variable: IMAPSieve.cause

   Implementations MAY invoke different Sieve scripts for the different
   conditions described in this document (append, copy, flag changes,
   annotation changes).  If the actions to be taken are common, and the
   implementation supports the [Include] extension, the common script
   code can be included as specified there.

   It may be preferable, though, to use a single script for all these
   conditions.  To support that, if the [Variables] extension is
   available, the implementation MUST set the reserved variable
   "${IMAPSieve.cause}", which contains the name of the action that
   caused the script to be invoked.  Its value is one of the following:

   o  APPEND (for invocations resulting from APPEND or MULTIAPPEND)

Internet-Draft               Lemonade-Sieve                December 2005


   o  COPY (for invocations resulting from COPY)

   o  FLAG (for invocations resulting from flag changes)

   o  ANNOTATE (for invocations resulting from new or changed
      annotations)


3.12  New Sieve Variable: IMAPSieve.mailbox

   If the [Variables] extension is available, the implementation MUST
   set the reserved variable "${IMAPSieve.mailbox}" to the name of the
   mailbox that the affected message is in, in the case of existing
   messages, or is targeted to be stored into, in the case of new
   messages.  The value of this variable is fixed when the script
   begins, and, in particular, MUST NOT change as a result of any
   action, such as "fileinto".

3.13  New Sieve Variable: IMAPSieve.changed.flags

   If the [Variables] extension is available, the [IMAP4Flags] extension
   is available, AND the script was invoked because of flag changes to
   an existing message, the implementation MUST set the reserved
   variable "${IMAPSieve.changed.flags}" to the name(s) of the flag(s)
   that have changed.  If the script was not invoked because of flag
   changes, this variable MUST be unknown (and, thus, its value MUST be
   the empty string).  The script will not know from this variable
   whether the flags have been set or reset, but it can use the
   "hasflag" test to determine the current value.  See example 2 in
   Section 5 for an example of how this might be used.

3.14  New Sieve Variable: IMAPSieve.changed.annotations

   If the [Variables] extension is available, the [Annotate] extension
   is available, AND the script was invoked because of annotation
   changes to an existing message, the implementation MUST set the
   reserved variable "${IMAPSieve.changed.annotations}" to the name(s)
   of the annotation(s) that have changed.  If the script was not
   invoked because of annotation changes, this variable MUST be unknown
   (and, thus, its value MUST be the empty string).

3.15  Interaction With Sieve Tests (Comparisons)

   This extension does not affect the operation of any tests or
   comparisons.

4.  Open Issues With This Document

   When this section is empty, I guess we're done....

   1.  Do we need the SIEVEFILTER command?  If so, exactly what should
       it do?

   2.  If EditHeader stuff is used with FLAG or ANNOTATE, should it be
       ignored or should it be an error?

   3.  If the reject action is used at all, should it be ignored or
       should it be an error?  Same question for other inappropriate
       actions.

   4.  Requirement to Variables extension: We should probably generalize
       the "cause" variable, and require it for all Sieve invocations.
       Normal delivery situations can have the value "DELIVERY".
       Otherwise, it's awkward to write a script that has to assume
       something about the ABSENCE of a "cause" variable.

   5.  Requirement to Variables document: There should be an example of
       a variable with a namespace attribute.

   6.  Do we need any more reserved Sieve variables for this?  Do we
       have too many?

   7.  All of the extensions that we describe how to work with: are they
       normative, or non-normative references?

   8.  Can anyone come up with some examples that use only features from
       the base Sieve spec?

5.  Examples

   Example 1:
   If a new message is added to the "ActionItems" mailbox, a copy is
   sent to the address "actionitems@example.com".

     require ["copy", "variables"];

     if anyof (${IMAPSieve.cause} :is "APPEND",
               ${IMAPSieve.cause} :is "COPY")  {
         if ${IMAPSieve.mailbox} :is "ActionItems" {
             redirect :copy "actionitems@example.com";
         }
     }

   Example 2:
   If the script is called for any message with the \Flagged flag set
   (tested through the [IMAP4Flags] extension), a notification is sent
   using the [Notify] extension.  No notification will be sent, though,
   if we're called with an existing message that already had that flag
   set.

     require ["nofity", "imap4flags", "variables"];

     if allof (hasflag "\\Flagged",
               not ${IMAPSieve.changed.flags} :contains "\\Flagged") {
         notify :message "Important message in ${IMAPSieve.mailbox}";
     }

   Example 3:
   [[More examples?: Can anyone come up with some examples that use only
   features from the base Sieve spec?]]

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].  Non-terminals referenced
   but not defined below are as defined by [IMAP].

   [[Maybe...: If we decide we need this command, the syntax goes
   here.]]

   command_auth  =/  sievefilter
                     ; Valid only in Authenticated or Selected state

   sievefilter   =   "SIEVEFILTER" to be defined

7.  Security Considerations

   It is possible to introduce script processing loops by having a Sieve
   script that is triggered by flag changes use the actions defined in
   the [IMAP4Flags] extension.  Implementations MUST take steps to
   prevent such loops.  One way to avoid this problem is that if a
   script is invoked by flag changes, and that script further changes
   the flags, those flag changes SHOULD NOT trigger a Sieve script
   invocation.

   Other security considerations are discussed in [IMAP], and [Sieve],
   as well as in some of the other extension documents.

8.  IANA Considerations

   [[IANA?: Do we need this, since there's not actually a Sieve
   capability defined here?]]
   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the Sieve
   extension specified in this document:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension
   Capability name: imapsieve
   Capability keyword: imapsieve
   Capability arguments: N/A
   Standards Track/IESG-approved experimental RFC number: this RFC
   Person and email address to contact for further information:
       Barry Leiba <leiba@watson.ibm.com>

   This information should be added to the list of sieve extensions
   given on http://www.iana.org/assignments/sieve-extensions.
