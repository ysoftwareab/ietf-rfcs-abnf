Abstract

   The deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of IPv4
   addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4 within an
   IPv6 dominant network.  Nodes will still need to communicate with
   IPv4 nodes that do not have a Dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and
   IPv6. The Dual Stack IPv6 Dominant Transition Mechanism (DSTM) is
   based on the use of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4 traffic
   within an IPv6 dominant network and provides a method to allocate a
   temporary IPv4 address to Dual IP Layer IPv6/IPv4 capable nodes. DSTM
   is also a way to avoid the use of Network Address Translation for
   early adopter IPv6 deployment to communicate with IPv4 legacy nodes
   and applications.

Internet Draft      Dual Stack Transition Mechanism            July 2005


1.  Introduction
   The deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of IPv4
   addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4 within an
   IPv6 dominant network.  Nodes will still need to communicate with
   IPv4 nodes that do not have a Dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and
   IPv6. The Dual Stack IPv6 Dominant Transition Mechanism (DSTM) is
   based on the use of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4 traffic
   within an IPv6 dominant network and provides a method to allocate a
   temporary IPv4 address to Dual IP Layer IPv6/IPv4 capable nodes. DSTM
   is also a way to avoid the use of Network Address Translation for
   early adopter IPv6 deployment to communicate with IPv4 legacy nodes
   and applications.

   DSTM is targeted to help the interoperation of IPv6 newly deployed
   networks with existing IPv4 networks, where the user wants to begin
   IPv6 adoption with an IPv6 dominant network plan, or later in the
   transition of IPv6, when IPv6 dominant networks will be more
   prevalent.

   When DSTM is deployed in a network, an IPv4 address can be allocated
   to a Dual IP Layer IPv6/IPv4 capable node to connect with IPv4 only
   capable nodes.  DSTM permits dual IPv6/IPv4 nodes to communicate with
   IPv4 only nodes and applications, without modification to any IPv4
   only node or application, or the IPv4 only application on the DSTM
   node. This allocation mechanism is coupled with the ability to
   perform IPv4-over-IPv6 tunneling of IPv4 packets inside the IPv6
   dominant network.

   The DSTM architecture is composed of a DSTM address server, and DSTM
   capable nodes. The DSTM server is responsible for IPv4 address
   allocation to client nodes and MAY also provide tunnel end points
   (TEP) to the DSTM nodes. The DSTM server MUST guarantee the
   uniqueness of the IPv4 address for a period of time.  The DSTM nodes
   will use TEPs to tunnel IPv4 packets within IPv6 to a DSTM Border
   router.  The DSTM border router then decapsulates the IPv6 packets
   and transmits the IPv4 packets to the destination IPv4 node. The DSTM
   border router MUST cache the path back to the DSTM node for the IPv4
   address to tunnel the packet in IPv6 to the original DSTM node.

2.  DSTM Terminology


DSTM Domain                         The network areas on an Intranet
where
                                    dual IPv6/IPv4 nodes use DSTM to
assure
                                    IPv4 communication. An IPv4
                                    address allocation server may be
deployed
                                    inside the domain to manage an IPv4
                                    address pool. IPv4 routing access
may
                                    not be maintained within a DSTM
domain.

DSTM Client                         A Dual IP Layer IPv4/IPv6 Capable
                                    Node that has implemented the DSTM
                                    client software in this
                                    specification.

DSTM Server                         A Dual IP Layer IPv4/IPv6 Capable
                                    Node that has implemented
                                    the DSTM server software
                                    in this specification.

DSTM Border Router                  A Dual IP Layer IPv4/IPv6 Capable
                                    Node that has implemented the DSTM
                                    border router software in this
                                    specification.

IPv6 Dominant Network               A network that is using IPv6 as the
                                    dominant network transport for
                                    network operations.

Dynamic Tunnel Interface            This is an interface on a DSTM
                                    Client that will permit the sending
                                    of IPv4 packets within IPv6 to a
                                    DSTM Border Router, and receive IPv4
                                    packets within IPv6 from an IPv4
                                    node or application.

3.  DSTM Problem Statement and Assumptions

   Since the IPv4 globally routable address space available is becoming
   a scarce resource, it is assumed that users will deploy IPv6 to
   reduce the need and reliability on IPv4 within a portion of their
   networks. Some users will require an aggressive transition to IPv6
   and will begin the deployment of IPv6 reducing immediately the
   reliance on IPv4 whereever possible.  Under this premise, supporting
   native IPv4 and native IPv6 simultaneously largely increases the
   complexity and cost of network administration (e.g. address plan,
   routing infrastructure). It is proposed, in this case, to define the
   network strategy plan to support IPv6 only use as soon as possible.
   Reliance on IPv4 infrastructure points like name service and address
   allocation for Dual IPv6/IPv4 capable nodes will move to an IPv6
   strategy.

   Using DSTM, DHCPv4 [DHC4] may be used to assign IPv4 addresses to a
   DSTM nodes, since IPv4 routing is not maintained within an IPv6
   dominant network implementation, to support DHCPv4 some IPv4 network
   connecvity would be required.  Using DHCPv6 [DHC6] reduces the
   reliance on IPv4 infrastructure for the transition to IPv6 with DSTM.
   But, DHCPv6 and DHCPv4 are not the only mechanisms that can be
   supported to allocate IPv4 addresses to a DSTM client.

   DSTM is a transition mechanism that uses existing protocols.  DSTM
   does not specify a protocol. However, DSTM defines client, server,
   and border router behavior and the properties of the temporary
   addresses allocation mechanisms.

   The core assumption within DSTM is that it is completely transparent
   to applications, which can continue to work with IPv4 addresses.  It
   is also transparent to the network, which carries only IPv6 packets.
   DSTM assumes the user, has deployed IPv6 to support end-2-end
   applications and security, without translation.

   DSTM implementation would also support the use of IPv6 dominant
   networks as specified in IPv6 Enterprise Scecnarios and Analysis
   [ENTSCE, ENTANA]

   The DSTM architecture base assumptions are as follows:


      1. The DSTM domain is within an Intranet not on the Internet.

      2. Dual IPv6/IPv4 nodes do not maintain IPv4 addresses except on a
         temporary basis, to communicate with IPv4 Applications.

      3. The temporary IPv4 address allocation is done by the DSTM
         server, different protocols such as DHCPv6 or other mechanism
can
         be used to assign the IPv4 address.  DHCPv6 is the recommended

         default mechanism.

      4. DSTM will keep IPv4 routing tables to a minimum and use
         IPv6 routing, which will reduce the network management required
         for IPv4 during transition within a DSTM Dominant IPv6 Network.

      5. Once IPv6 nodes have obtained IPv4 addresses Dynamic Tunneling
         is used to encapsulate the IPv4 packet within IPv6 and then
         forward that packet to an IPv6 TEP DSTM border router, where
the
         packet will be decapsulated and forwarded using IPv4.  The IPv4
         allocation mechanism, from the DSTM server, can provide the TEP
IPv6
         address to the DSTM client, in addition to manual
configuration.

      6. Existing IPv4 applications or nodes do not have to be modified.

   Implementation defined software will have to exist to support DSTM:

      1. DSTM server implementation is required to maintain
         configuration information about TEPs for encapsulating IPv4
         packets between IPv6 nodes that can forward IPv4 packets to an
         IPv4 routing destination, and to maintain a pool of IPv4
         addresses.

      2. DSTM client implementation is required to support the dynamic
         tunneling mechanisms in this specification to encapsulate IPv4
         packets within IPv6, and be able to communicate with the DSTM
server
         to obtain IPv4 addresses and TEPs.

      3. DSTM border router implementation is required to support the
         decapsulation of IPv6 packets from DSTM clients and forward
         them to the IPv4 destination, and cache the IPv6 address and
         the source IPv4 address used by the DSTM client.

4.  DSTM Deployment Example

   In the example below, the following notation will be used:


      X    will designate a dual IPv6/IPv4 node, X6 will be the
           IPv6 address of this node and X4 the IPv4 address
      Y    will designate a DSTM border router at the boundary between
an
           IPv6 DSTM domain and an IPv4-only domain.
      Z    will designate an IPv4-only node and Z4 its address.
      ==>  means an IPv6 packet
      -->  means an IPv4 packet
      ++>  means a tunneled IPv4 packet is encapsulated in an IPv6
packet
      ..>  means a DNS query or response. The path taken by this
           packet does not matter in the examples
      "a"  means the DNS name of a node

   This example describes the case where an application running on a
   dual IPv6/IPv4 node (X6) wants to establish a session with an IPv4
   application (Z4).

   The IPv4 routing table of node X is configured to send IPv4 packets
   to the nodes Dynamic Tunnel Interface (DTI) interface.

   the association between the IPv4 and the IPv6 address of X, is able
   to send the packet encapsulating the IPv4 packet within IPv6 back to
   X.




5.  DSTM Client

   A DSTM client requires the implementation of a DSTM Server Access
   Module and a Dynamic Tunnel Interface.

Internet Draft      Dual Stack Transition Mechanism            July 2005


5.1 DSTM Server Access Module

   A DSTM Server Access Module connects to the DSTM Server to obtain an
   IPv4 address and TEP.  DSTM recommends the use of a DHCPv6 client
   implementation or  using the Tunnel Setup Protocol.


   The DSTM client may also receive an expiration life time for that
   IPv4 address, which when expired the DSTM client cannot continue to
   use that IPv4 address.

   The DSTM client must not perform any Dynamic upates to the DNS
   [DYNDNS] for any IPv4 address returned to the DSTM Server Access
   Module.

   The TEP can also be manually configured on the DSTM client.



5.2 DSTM Dynamic Tunnel Interface (DTI)

   The DSTM client implementation after obtaining an IPv4 address and
   TEP configures its DTI to send an IPv4 packet to the IPv6 TEP of a
   DSTM border router, and receive IPv4 packets from an IPv6 TEP for an
   IPv4 application on a DSTM client.




6.  DSTM Server

   A DSTM server implementation requires the implementation of a DSTM
   Client Access Module, Address Pool Access Module, and Routing
   Information Access Module.



6.1 DSTM Client Access Module

   The DSTM Client Access Module is required to accept requests from
   DSTM clients for an IPv4 address and TEPs, and then return an IPv4
   address and TEPs to the DSTM client.  DSTM recommends the use of a
   DHCPv6 server implementation or Tunnel Broker [TUNBKR] as the DSTM
   Client Access Module.

Internet Draft      Dual Stack Transition Mechanism            July 2005


6.2 DSTM Address Pool Access Module

   The DSTM Address Pool Module is required to maintain a pool of IPv4
   addresses for DSTM clients and maintain the lifetimes for those
   addresses.  The lifetime for those IPv4 addresses can be provided to
   the DSTM client with the IPv4 address and TEPs.



6.3 DSTM Routing Information Access Module

   The DSTM Routing Information Access Module is required to learn or
   manually configure the TEPs within the DSTM domain to provide TEPs to
   the DSTM clients.




7.  DSTM Border Router

   The DSTM border router is required to be able to receive IPv6 packets
   from DSTM clients and then decapsulate the inner IPv4 packets and
   send to the IPv4 destination address in the IPv4 packets.  The DSTM
   border router is required to maintain the IPv6 address of the DSTM
   clients that send IPv6 packets with IPv4 encapsulated, so IPv4
   packets sent to the DSTM clients IPv4 address can be tunneled back to
   the DSTM client.



8.  Applicability Statement

DSTM is applicable for use from within a DSTM Domain in which hosts need
to communicate with IPv4-only hosts or through IPv4-only applications on
a user Intranet or over the Internet.

The motivation of DSTM is to allow dual IP layer nodes to communicate
using global IPv4 addresses across an Intranet or Internet, where global
addresses are required.  However, the mechanisms used in DSTM can also
be deployed using private IPv4 addresses to permit the Intranet use of
DSTM where users require temporary access to IPv4 services within their
Intranet.

In DSTM, a mechanism is needed to perform the address allocation
process. This can be decoupled in two functions: the management of the
IPv4 address pool and the communication protocol between server and
clients. A number of mechanisms, like DHCPv6, can perform these
functions.

The exact capacities of the DTI required by DSTM is implementation

defined. Optionally, it is allowed that DSTM nodes configure manually
(in a static manner) the tunnel to the TEP; but the recommendation is
not to do this. The dynamic configuration of DTI as a result of the
address allocation process is the right way to execute DSTM on an IPv6
Network.

DSTM also assumes that all packets returning from an IPv4 node to a DSTM
node are routed through the originating DSTM TEP who maintains the
association of the DSTM client 's IPv4/IPv6 addresses.  At this time it
is beyond the scope of this proposal to permit IPv4 packets destined to
a DSTM node to be forwarded through a non-originating DSTM TEP.



9.  Security Considerations

The DSTM mechanism can use all of the defined security specifications
for each functional part of its operation. For DNS, the DNS Security
Extensions/Update can be used. Concerning address allocation,
when connections are initiated by the DSTM nodes, the risk of Denial
of Service attacks (DOS) based on address pool exaustion is limited
since DSTM is configured in an Intranet environement. In this scenario,
If
DHCPv6 is deployed, the DHCPv6 Authentication Message can be used too.
Also, since the TEPs are inside an Intranet, they can not be
used as an open relay.  Finally, for IPv4 communications on DSTM
nodes, once the node has an IPv4 address, IPsec can be used since
DSTM does not break secure end-to-end communications at any point.
Also TSP can be used with the Transport Layer Security protocol over a
VPN.
