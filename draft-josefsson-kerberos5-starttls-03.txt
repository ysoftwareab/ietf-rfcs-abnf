Internet-Draft       Protecting Kerberos V5 with TLS       December 2007


1.  Introduction and Background

   This document describe how a Kerberos V5 [3] implementation may
   upgrade communication between clients and Key Distribution Centers
   (KDCs) to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) [4] protocol.

   The TLS protocol offer integrity and privacy protected exchanges that
   can be authentication using X.509 certificates, OpenPGP keys [8], and
   user name and passwords via SRP [7].

   There are several reasons to use Kerberos V5 over TLS.

   o  Prevents downgrade attacks affecting, e.g., encryption types and
      pre-auth data negotiation.  The encryption type field in KDC-REQ,
      and the METHOD-DATA field with the requested pre-auth types from
      the server in KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED errors in KDC-REP, are sent
      without integrity or privacy protection in Kerberos 5.  This
      allows an attacker to replace the encryption type with a
      compromised encryption type, e.g., 56-bit DES, or request that
      clients should use a broken pre-auth type.  Since clients in
      general cannot know the encryption types other servers support, or
      the pre-auth types servers prefer or require, it is difficult for
      the client to detect if there was a man-in-the-middle or if the
      remote server simply did not support a stronger encryption type or
      preferred another pre-auth type.


   o  Kerberos exchanges are privacy protected.  Part of many Kerberos
      packets are transfered without privacy protection (i.e.,
      encryption).  That part contains information, such as the client
      principal name, the server principal name, the encryption types
      supported by the client, the lifetime of tickets, etc.  Revealing
      such information is, in some threat models, considered a problem.


   o  Additional authentication against the KDC.  In some situations,
      users are equipped with smart cards with a RSA authentication key.
      In others, users have a OpenPGP client on their desktop, with a
      public OpenPGP key known to the server.

   o  The TLS protocol has been studied by many parties.  In some threat
      models, the designer prefer to reduce the number of protocols that
      can hurt the overall system security if they are compromised.


   o  Explicit server authentication of the KDC to the client.  In
      traditional Kerberos 5, authentication of the KDC is proved as a
      side effect that the KDC knows your encryption key (i.e., your

2.  Kerberos V5 STARTTLS Extension

   The STARTTLS extension uses the Kerberos V5 TCP extension mechanism
   [5].  The extension uses bit #TBD in the extension bitmask.

   The protocol is as follows.  After the server has sent the 4-octet
   value 0x00000000 to indicate support of this extension, the stream
   will be controlled by the TLS protocol and its framing.  The TLS
   protocol is initiated by the client.

   Typically, the client initiate the TLS handshake protocol by sending
   a client hello, and the server responds, and the handshake continues
   until it either succeed or fails.

   If for any reason the handshake fails, the STARTTLS protocol will
   also fail, and the TLS error is used as the error indication.

   If the handshake succeeds, the Kerberos V5 authentication protocol is
   performed within the protected TLS channel, like a normal TCP
   Kerberos V5 exchange.  In particular, this means that every Kerberos
   V5 packet will be prefixed by a 4-octet length field, that indicate
   the length of the Kerberos V5 packet.  However, to conform with this
   specification, any KDC-REQ (AS-REQ or TGS-REQ) message MUST contain
   the "pa-channel-binding" pre-authentication data.

3.  Channel Binding Pre-Authentication Data

   The pre-authentication structure is defined in RFC 4120 as:

     PA-DATA         ::= SEQUENCE {
             -- NOTE: first tag is [1], not [0]
             padata-type     [1] Int32,
             padata-value    [2] OCTET STRING -- might be encoded AP-REQ
     }

   Here we define a new pre-authentication data, called "pa-channel-
   binding".  It has a padata-type integer value of #TBD.  The contents
   of the padata-value field is the channel binding data, as discussed
   in [6].

4.  Examples

   A complete packet flow for a successful AS-REQ/REP exchange protected
   by this mechanism will be as follows.  The "STARTTLS-bit" is a
   4-octet value with only the bit allocated for this extension set.

5.  STARTTLS aware KDC Discovery

   Section 7.2.3 of Kerberos V5 [3] describe how Domain Name System
   (DNS) SRV records [2] can be used to find the address of an KDC.
   Using the terminology of Section 7.2.3 of RFC 4120, we define a new
   Proto of "tls" to indicate that the particular KDC is intended to
   support this STARTTLS extension.  The Service, Realm, TTL, Class,
   SRV, Priority, Weight, Port and Target have the same meaning as in
   RFC 4120.

   For example:

   _kerberos._tls.EXAMPLE.COM. IN SRV 0 0 88 kdc1.example.com.
   _kerberos._tls.EXAMPLE.COM. IN SRV 1 0 88 kdc2.example.com.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to allocate a bit in the "Kerberos TCP
   Extensions" registry for the extension described in this document, as
   per [5].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in Kerberos V5, TLS, and the extension
   mechanism framework are inherited.

   To protect against the inherent downgrade attack in the extension
   framework, it is suggested that implementations offer a policy to
   require that this extension is successfully negotiated.  For
   interoperability with implementations that do not support this
   extension, it is suggested that the policy is disabled by default.
