Internet-Draft            Sieve MIME Operations                July 2009


1.  Introduction

   MIME messages ([RFC2045]) are often complex objects, consisting of
   many parts and sub-parts.  This extension defines mechanisms for
   performing tests on MIME body parts, looping through the MIME body
   parts, extracting information from a MIME body part, changing the
   contents of a MIME body part, and enclosing the entire message within
   a wrapper.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Conventions for notations are as in [RFC5228] section 1.1.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Sieve Loops: Actions "foreverypart" and "break"

   The base Sieve language has no looping mechanism.  Given that
   messages may contain multiple parts, in order to support filters that
   apply to any and all parts, we introduce a new control command:
   "foreverypart", which is an iterator that walks though every MIME
   part of a message, including nested parts, depth first, and applies
   the commands in the specified block to each of them.  The iterator
   will start with the first MIME part (as its current context) and will
   execute a command block (Sieve commands enclosed by {...}).  Upon
   completion of this command block, the iterator advances to the next
   MIME part (as its current context) and executes the same command
   block again.

   The iterator can be terminated prematurely by a new Sieve command,
   "break".

   Usage:  foreverypart [":name" string] block

   Usage:  break [":name" string];

   "foreverypart" commands can be nested inside other "foreverypart"
   commands.  When this occurs, the nested "foreverypart" iterates over
   the MIME parts contained within the MIME part currently being
   targeted by the nearest enclosing "foreverypart" command.  (That is,
   the inner loop only operates on children of the bodypart currently
   accessed by the outer loop.)  If that MIME part is a terminal MIME
   part (i.e. does not contain other MIME parts) then the nested
   "foreverypart" loop is simply ignored.

Internet-Draft            Sieve MIME Operations                July 2009


   Sieve implementations MAY limit the number of nested loops that occur
   within one another, however they MUST support at least one nested
   loop inside another loop.

   If a name is given to a "break" command, it terminates the closest
   enclosing loop with the identical matching name.  (If a nested
   "foreverypart" name is the same as a "foreverpart" name in an outer
   level, the outer level name is hidden.)  It is an error if there is
   no enclosing loop with that name.


4.  Changes to Sieve Tests

   This specification extends the base Sieve "header", "address" and
   "exists" tests to support targeting those tests at a specific MIME
   part or at all MIME parts in the enclosing scope.

4.1.  Test "header"

   The "header" test is extended with the addition of new ":mime" and
   ":anychild" tagged arguments and their associated options.

   Usage:  header [":mime"] [":anychild"] [MIMEOPTS]
      [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
      <header-names: string-list> <key-list: string-list>

   Usage:  The definition of [MIMEOPTS] is:

      Syntax: ":type" / ":subtype" / ":contenttype" /
      ":param" <param-list: string-list>

   When the ":mime" tagged argument is present in the "header" test, it
   will parse the MIME header lines in the message so that tests can be
   performed on specific elements.

   When used outside the context of a "foreverypart" iterator, and
   without an ":anychild" tagged argument, the "header" test will
   examine only the outer top-level [RFC5322] headers of the message.

   When used inside the context of a "foreverypart" iterator, and
   without an ":anychild" tagged argument, the "header" test will
   examine the headers associated with the current MIME part context
   from the loop.

   When used outside the context of a "foreverypart" iterator, and with
   an ":anychild" tagged argument, the "header" test will examine all
   MIME body parts and return true if any of them satisfies the test.

Internet-Draft            Sieve MIME Operations                July 2009


   When used inside the context of a "foreverypart" iterator, and with
   an ":anychild" tagged argument, the "header" test will examine the
   current MIME part context and all its nested MIME body parts,
   returning true if any of them satisfies the test.

   The "header" test with the ":mime" tagged argument can test various
   aspects of certain structured MIME headers.  Implementations SHOULD
   support desegmentation, decoding, and charset translation of
   parameter values encoded according to [RFC2231] as part of this test.
   Additionally, [RFC2047] describes a process whereby [RFC5322] headers
   can be encoded in various ways.  That encoding is not strictly
   allowed in MIME parameters, however in practice it has been used in
   many email implementations.  So, SIEVE implementations MAY decode
   [RFC2047] encoded words in parameter values as part of this test.

   These options are available:

   :type  for a "Content-Type" MIME header field, parses and tests the
      value of the MIME type specified in the header; for a "Content-
      Disposition" MIME header field, parses and tests the value of the
      disposition specified in the header; for other MIME headers, uses
      a blank string for the test

   :subtype  for a "Content-Type" MIME header field, parses and tests
      the value of the MIME subtype specified in the header; for a
      "Content-Disposition" MIME header field, uses a blank string for
      the test; for other MIME headers, uses a blank string for the test

   :contenttype  for a "Content-Type" MIME header field, parses and
      tests the combined value of the MIME type and subtype specified in
      the header; for a "Content-Disposition" MIME header field, behaves
      the same as the :type option; for other MIME headers, uses a blank
      string for the test

   :param  parses the header looking for MIME parameters in the header.
      The supplied string-list lists the names of any parameters to be
      tested.  If any one named parameter value matches any of the test
      string values, the test will return true.

   When the :count option from [RFC5231] is used, the following applies:

   a.  for :type, :subtype or :contenttype, return a count of the number
       of headers that parsed successfully

   b.  for :param, return a count of the number of parameters with the
       given name that were found

   Example:

   require ["mime", "fileinto"];

   if header :mime :type "Content-Type" "image"
   {
       fileinto "INBOX.images";
   }

   In this example, any message that contains a MIME image type part at
   the top-level is saved to the mailbox "INBOX.images".

   Example:

   require ["mime", "fileinto"];

   if header :mime :anychild :contenttype
             "Content-Type" "text/html"
   {
       fileinto "INBOX.html";
   }

   In this example, any message that contains any MIME part with a
   content-type of "text/html" is saved to the mailbox "INBOX.html".

   Example:

   require ["mime", "foreverypart", "fileinto"];

   foreverypart
   {
       if allof (
         header :mime :param "filename" :contains
            "Content-Disposition" "important",
         header :mime :subtype "Content-Type" "pdf",
         size :over "100K")
       {
           fileinto "INBOX.important";
           break;
       }
   }

   In this example, any message that contains a MIME part that has a
   content-disposition with a filename parameter containing the text
   "important", has a content-subtype of "pdf" and is bigger than 100 Kb
   is saved to the mailbox "INBOX.important".

4.2.  Test "address"

   The "address" test is extended with the addition of new ":mime" and
   ":anychild" tagged arguments and their associated options.

   Usage:  address [":mime"] [":anychild"] [COMPARATOR]
      [ADDRESS-PART] [MATCH-TYPE]
      <header-list: string-list> <key-list: string-list>

   When the ":mime" tagged argument is present in the "address" test, it
   will parse the MIME header lines as if they were standard address
   header lines in a message so that tests can be performed on specific
   elements.

   The behavior of the ":anychild" tagged argument and the interaction
   with the "foreverypart" iterator is the same as for the extended
   "header" test Section 4.1.

   That is,

      the use of "address" with no ":mime" and ":anychild" tagged
      argument is the test defined in [RFC5228], i.e. it will *only*
      operate on top level header fields, whether it is inside
      "foreverypart" or not.

      the use of "address" with ":mime" and no ":anychild" operates on
      the current MIME part only (or on the top level header fields, if
      outside "foreverypart")

      the use of "address" with ":mime" and ":anychild" operates on the
      current MIME part and all of its descendants

   Example:

   require ["mime", "fileinto"];

   if address :mime :is :all "content-from" "tim@example.com"
   {
       fileinto "INBOX.part-from-tim";
   }

   In this example, any message that contains a MIME Content-From header
   at the top-level matching the text "tim@example.com" is saved to the
   mailbox "INBOX.part-from-tim".

4.3.  Test "exists"

   The "exists" test is extended with the addition of the new ":mime"
   and ":anychild" tagged arguments and their associated options.

   Usage:  exists [":mime"] [":anychild"] <header-names: string-list>

   When the ":mime" tagged argument is present in the "exists" test, the
   test is extended to check for the existence of MIME headers in MIME
   parts.

   The behavior of the ":anychild" tagged argument and the interaction
   with the "foreverypart" iterator is the same as for the extended
   "header" test Section 4.1.

   That is,

      the use of "exists" with no ":mime" and ":anychild" tagged
      argument is the test defined in [RFC5228], i.e. it will *only*
      operate on top level header fields, whether it is inside
      "foreverypart" or not.

      the use of "exists" with ":mime" and no ":anychild" operates on
      the current MIME part only (or on the top level header fields, if
      outside "foreverypart")

      the use of "exists" with ":mime" and ":anychild" operates on the
      current MIME part and all of its descendants

   Example:

   require ["mime", "fileinto"];

   if exists :mime :anychild "content-md5"
   {
       fileinto "INBOX.md5";
   }

   In this example, any message that contains a MIME Content-MD5 header
   in any MIME part is saved to the mailbox "INBOX.md5".


5.  Action "replace"

Internet-Draft            Sieve MIME Operations                July 2009


   Usage:  replace [":mime"] [":subject" string] [":from" string]
      <replacement: string>

   The "replace" command is defined to allow a MIME part to be replaced
   with the text supplied in the command.

   When used in the context of a "foreverypart" iterator, the MIME part
   to be replaced is the "current" MIME part.  If the current MIME
   context is a multipart MIME part, the entire multipart MIME part is
   replaced, which would alter the MIME structure of the message by
   eliminating all of the children of the multipart part.  (Replacing a
   non-multipart MIME part within a "foreverypart" loop context does not
   alter the overall message structure.)  If the MIME structure is
   altered, the change takes effect immediately: the "foreverypart"
   iterator that is executing does not go into the no-longer existing
   body parts, and subsequent "foreverypart" iterators would use the new
   message structure.

   When used outside the context of a "foreverypart" loop, the MIME part
   to be replaced is the entire message.

   If the :mime parameter is not specified, the replacement string is a
   text/plain part in UTF-8 [RFC3629].

   If the :mime parameter is specified, then the replacement string is,
   in fact, a MIME entity as defined in [RFC2045] section 2.4, including
   both MIME headers and content.

   If the entire message is being replaced, the optional ":subject"
   parameter specifies a subject line to attach to the message that is
   generated.  UTF-8 characters can be used in the string argument;
   implementations MUST convert the string to [RFC2047] encoded words if
   and only if non-ASCII characters are present.  Implementations MUST
   preserve the previous Subject header as an Original-Subject header.
   Implementations MUST preserve all other header fields from the
   original message with the exception of those relating to the MIME
   structure that is being replaced.

   If the entire message is being replaced, as an indication that the
   message is no longer as created by the original author of the
   message, the optional ":from" parameter may be used to specify an
   alternate address to use in the From field of the message that is
   generated.  The string must specify a valid [RFC5322] mailbox-list.
   Implementations SHOULD check the syntax and generate an error when a
   syntactically invalid ":from" parameter is specified.
   Implementations MAY also impose restrictions on what addresses can be
   specified in a ":from" parameter; it is suggested that values that
   fail such a validity check simply be ignored rather than causing the

   replace action to fail.  Implementations MUST preserve the previous
   From header as an Original-From header.

   Implementations that support the "editheader" extension [RFC5293]
   MUST ensure that any Original-Subject or Original-From headers added
   by the system cannot be modified or removed.  Implementations MAY
   prevent the addition of Original-Subject and Orignal-From headers via
   the "editheader" extension.

   If ":mime" is specified and either ":subject" or ":from" is
   specified, the ":subject:" or ":from" parameter MUST be ignored.
   This SHOULD be flagged as a compilation error.


6.  Action "enclose"

   Usage:  enclose <:subject string> <:headers string-list> string

   A new Sieve action command is defined to allow an entire message to
   be enclosed as an attachment to a new message.  After enclosure,
   subsequent actions affecting the message header or content, as well
   as tests operating on the MIME structure or accessing MIME header
   fields, use the newly created message instead of the original
   message; this means that any use of a "replace" action or other
   similar actions should be executed before the "enclose" action.

   If multiple "enclose" actions are executed by a script, the message
   is enclosed multiple times.  (If a Sieve script desires to choose
   between different enclosures, or wants to delay the enclosure to the
   end of the script, it can use variables with appropriate tests
   [RFC5229].)

   This action does not affect messages that are forwarded via a
   "redirect" action.

   Specifically, the original message becomes a multipart/mixed message
   with two parts: a text/plain portion with the string argument as its
   body, and a message/rfc822 portion with the original message
   enclosed.  The Content-Type: header field becomes multipart/mixed.
   The optional Subject: header is specified by the :subject argument;
   if not present the subject will be taken from the enclosed message.
   Any headers specified by :headers are copied from the old message
   into the new message.  If not specified by :headers, Date: and From:
   headers should be synthesized to reflect the current date and the
   user running the Sieve action.

7.  Action "extracttext"

   Usage:  extracttext [MODIFIER] [":first" number] <varname: string>

   The "extracttext" action may be used within the context of a
   "foreverypart" loop and is used to store text into a variable as
   defined by [RFC5229].  Servers MUST support transcoding of any
   textual body part into UTF-8 for use with this action.  This requires
   decoding any transfer encoding as well as transcoding from the
   indicated character set into UTF-8.  It stores at most :first
   characters of the transcoded content of the current MIME body part in
   the variable identified by varname.  If the :first parameter is not
   present, the whole content of the current MIME body part is stored.
   In either case the actually stored data MAY be truncated to conform
   to implementation specific limit on variable length and/or on MIME
   body part length.  If the transfer encoding or character set is
   unrecognized by the implementation or recognized but invalid, an
   empty string will result.

   If "extracttext" is used outside the context of a "foreverypart"
   loop, the action will set the variable identified by varname to the
   empty string.  This SHOULD be flagged as a compilation error.

   Modifiers are applied on the extracted text before it is stored in
   the variable.


8.  Sieve Capability Strings

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "foreverypart" and "break"
   actions will advertise the capability string "foreverypart".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the ":mime" and ":anychild"
   tagged arguments to the "header", "address" and "exists" commands
   will advertise the capability string "mime".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "replace" action will
   advertise the capability string "replace".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "enclose" action will
   advertise the capability string "enclose".

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "extracttext" action will
   advertise the capability string "extracttext".  Note that to be
   useful, the "extracttext" action also requires the "variables"
   [RFC5229] and "foreverypart" capabilities.

9.  Examples

9.1.  Example 1

   A Sieve script to replace all the Windows executable attachments in a
   message would be:

   require [ "foreverypart", "mime", "replace" ];
   foreverypart
   {
     if anyof (
            header :mime :contenttype :is
              "Content-Type" "application/exe",
            header :mime :param "filename"
              :matches ["Content-Type", "Content-Disposition"] "*.com" )
     {
       replace "Executable attachment removed by user filter";
     }
   }

9.2.  Example 2

   A Sieve script to warn the user about executable attachment types
   would be:

   require [ "foreverypart", "mime", "enclose" ];

   foreverypart
   {
     if header :mime :param "filename"
        :matches ["Content-Type", "Content-Disposition"]
          ["*.com", "*.exe", "*.vbs", "*.scr",
           "*.pif", "*.hta", "*.bat", "*.zip" ]
     {
       # these attachment types are executable
       enclose :subject "Warning" :text
   WARNING! The enclosed message contains executable attachments.
   These attachments types may contain a computer virus program
   that can infect your computer and potentially damage your data.

   Before clicking on these message attachments, you should verify
   with the sender that this message was sent by them and not a
   computer virus.

9.3.  Example 3

   A Sieve script to extract subject and text out of messages from the
   boss:

   require ["mime", "variables", "extracttext"];

   if header :contains "from" "boss@example.org"
   {
     # :matches is used to get the value of the Subject header
     if header :matches "Subject" "*"
     {
       set "subject" "${1}";
     }

     # extract the first 100 characters of the first text/* part
     foreverypart
     {
       if header :mime :type :is "Content-Type" "text"
       {
         extracttext :first 100 "msgcontent";
         break;
       }
     }

     # if it's not a 'for your information' message
     if not header :contains "subject" "FYI:"
     {
       # do something using ${subject} and ${msgcontent}
       # such as sending a notification using a
       # notification extension
     }
   }

11.  Security Considerations

   The "enclose" action creates an entirely new message, as compared to
   just redirecting or forwarding the existing message.  Therefore, any
   site policies applicable to message submission should be enforced.




Hansen & Daboo          Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            Sieve MIME Operations                July 2009


   The looping specification specified here provides easier access to
   information about the message contents, which may also be achieved
   through other sieve tests.  This is not believed to raise any
   additional security issues beyond those for the Sieve "envelope" and
   "body" [RFC5173] tests.

   Any change in message content may interfere with digital signature
   mechanisms that include that content in the signed material.  In
   particular, using "replace" makes direct changes to the body content
   and will affect the body hash included in DKIM signatures [RFC4871],
   or the message signature used for S/MIME [RFC3851], PGP [RFC1991] or
   OpenPGP [RFC4880].

   It is not possible to examine the MIME structure of decrypted content
   in a multipart/encrypted MIME part.

   When "enclose" is used on a message containing a multipart/signed
   MIME part, the SIEVE implementation MUST ensure that the original
   message is copied octet-for-octet to maintain the validity of the
   digital signature.

   The system MUST be sized and restricted in such a manner that even
   malicious use of mime part matching does not deny service to other
   users of the host system.

   All of the security considerations given in the base Sieve
   specification also apply to these extensions.


12.  IANA Considerations

   The Original-Subject: and Original-From: headers are to be registered
   in the Permanent Message Header Fields registry.

   The following templates specify the IANA registrations of the Sieve
   extensions specified in this document.  This information should be
   added to the IANA registry of Sieve Extensions (currently found at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sieve-extensions).
