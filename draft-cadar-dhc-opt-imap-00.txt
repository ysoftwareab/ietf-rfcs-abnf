Internet-Draft     IMAP Configuration Option for DHCP          June 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a new option for email related configuration
   information in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131].

2.  Requirements notation & Naming Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to DHCPv4 as defined in
   "Terminology" section of the DHCPv4 specification [RFC2131].

4.  The Internet Message Access Protocol Server Option Format

   The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Server Option provides a
   list of one or more IPv4 addresses of IMAP [RFC2060] servers
   available to the clients for message retrieval from mailboxes on
   these servers.  The IMAP servers SHOULD be listed in the order of
   preference.  The format of the IMAP Protocol Servers option is shown
   in Figure 1.

        Code  Len            Address 1         Address 2
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
      | TBD |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

                         Figure 1: IMAP_SERVERS

   Code: is TBD as per [RFC2939].

   Len: Length n gives the total number of octets of ipv4 IMAP server
      addresses, it must be a multiple of 4.


5.  Security Considerations

   The IMAP server option may be used by an intruder DHCP server to
   cause DHCP clients to contact a rogue IMAP server, resulting in
   failure of email retrieval.  Also a roque IMAP server may get the
   login name and password of the clients which attempt to contact the
   IMAP servers.

   To avoid attacks through these option, the DHCP client SHOULD use
   authenticated DHCP (see "Authentication for DHCP messages"

   specification [RFC3118]).

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value for the IMAP option code in
   accordance with [RFC2939].
