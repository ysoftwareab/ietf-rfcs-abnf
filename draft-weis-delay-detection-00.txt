Abstract

   This memo describes a method that indicates to the receiver of an IP
   Internet Protocol datagram the time at which it was sent.  The
   receiver of the datagram can then judge how it was recently it was
   sent and discard packets deemed to be 'too old' according to their
   policy.

1.  Introduction

   IP datagrams can be subject to a delivery delay attack, where a host
   or gateway receives datagrams that are not fresh.  A fresh datagram
   is defined as one "Recently generated; not replayed from some earlier
   interaction of the protocol."  [RFC4949].  Even when IP datagrams are
   validated legitimate using an integrity transform and are protected
   from replay, delivered datagrams may have been delayed for an
   unbounded period of time.

   Delivery delay detection is useful when the value of data included in
   the IP datagram is time sensitive.  Delivery delay protection is even
   more valuable when replay protection is not available.  For example,
   while the IPsec [RFC4301] transforms IP Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and IP Authentication Header [RFC4302]
   include replay protection, it must be disabled when multi-sender
   IPsec security associations are used to protect multicast and group
   communications.  Such Many-to-Many Applications [RFC3170] often
   require the use of multi-sender security associations, where
   receivers cannot use the sequence number replay protection method.
   In such cases, a single counter cannot record responses from multiple
   senders, and no provision is made for multiple counters in the
   security association.

   This memo describes an IP Delivery Delay Detection Protocol using
   timestamps to declare the age of an IP datagram, enabling receivers
   to make a judgement whether to accept an IP datagram as "fresh"
   [RFC4949].

Internet-Draft                   IP-D3P                    December 2013


2.  IP Delivery Delay Detection Protocol (IP-D3P)

   An IP-D3P datagram consists of a header and an IP payload.  The IP-
   D3P header includes a timestamp, which receivers of the packet use to
   determine whether or not the packet has been recently generated.
   Receivers compare the timestamp delivered in the IP packet to their
   local time and make a determination as to whether it should be
   accepted.  Freshness does not provide replay protection, as it makes
   no explicit judgement as to whether a receiver has received a
   particular packet before.  Rather, it allows the receiver to
   determine whether the packet has been delayed in delivery beyond an
   acceptable point in time.  A typical policy would be to choose a time
   larger than a reasonable delivery time, which delay indicates a
   possible packet delay attack.  When combined with replay protection,
   IP-D3P provides the receiver assurance that the packet is not only
   unique, but also fresh.

   Varying formats of timestamps are possible.  This memo declares
   several formats with varying degrees of timestamp precision.  It is
   important that both sender and receiver interpret the time in the
   same degree of accuracy, else the receiver determination of freshness
   may be in error.  For example, if the sender reported a timestamp in
   seconds and he receiver interpreted the timestamp in microseconds it
   would likely reject many datagrams due to the precision error.

2.1.  IP-D3P Header

   The IP-D3P header consists of a type and a fixed-size timestamp,
   followed by a datagram, which may be either a full or partial IP
   datagram depending on the use case.

                          Figure 1: IP-D3P Header

   The header fields are defined as follows:

   o  Next Header (1 octet) -- Identifies the type of data in the
      Datagram following the IP-D3P header.  Valid types are described
      in [PROT-REG].

   o  Type (1 octet) -- Type of timestamp contained in the header.
      Valid values are defined in Section 2.1.1.

Internet-Draft                   IP-D3P                    December 2013


   o  RESERVED (2 octets) -- MUST be zero, and MUST be ignored on
      receipt.

   o  Timestamp (variable) -- Timestamp declaring when the packet was
      originated.  Length depends on type of timestamp.

2.1.1.  Type

   This memo defines the following types.  A conforming implementation
   MUST implement POSIX-TIME-SEC.  Each type indicates a fixed sized
   timestamp, which is valuable for packet evaluation efficiency.  The
   length of the header can then also be trivially determined based on
   its Type.

   o  POSIX-TIME-SEC.  Specifies that the timestamp refers to current
      time as seconds since the POSIX Epoch [POSIX.1] (i..e., time as
      the number of seconds beginning January 1, 1970 not counting leap
      seconds.  The timestamp has a length of 4 bytes.

   o  POSIX-TIME-DECISEC.  Specifies that timestamp refers to current
      time as seconds since the POSIX Epoch, specified in deciseconds
      (tenths of a second).  The timestamp has a length of 6 bytes.

   o  POSIX-TIME-MSEC.  Specifies that the timestamp refers to current
      time as seconds since the POSIX Epoch, specified in milliseconds.
      The timestamp has a length of 8 bytes.

2.2.  Outbound Packet Processing

   An IP-D3P header is added to the packet as described in Figure 1.
   The sender inserts the type defined by policy into the Type field and
   places the current time value in the Timestamp field as specified by
   the Type.  For example, when the Type is POSIX-TIME-SEC, the current
   value of seconds from the system clock is translated into POSIX time
   as defined in Section 2.1.1 and placed into the header.

   When IP-D3P is added to an IP packet, the IP-D3P Next Header field
   identifies the Protocol Id representing the next header (e.g., TCP).
   When IP-D3P is used with a IP-IP encapsulation (e.g., IPsec Tunnel
   Mode), the IP-D3P Next Header field represents the type of datagram
   following (e.g., 4 for IPv4, 41 for IPv6).

2.3.  Inbound Packet Processing

   A receiver first validates that the Type value in the IP-D3P header
   matches the expected type, as according to policy.  It then extracts
   the timestamp and compares it to a sliding window maintained by the
   receiver that is based on the Type of time.  A timestamp found within

Internet-Draft                   IP-D3P                    December 2013


   the sliding window is accepted, and the packet is treated as a fresh
   packet (e.g., is processed further).  If the timestamp is outside of
   the receiver's window, the packet is discarded.

   Figure 2 shows the sliding window used by D3P. A receiver chooses a
   window size of W, which lies between Ws and We centered around the
   current time of the receiver (Tr).  When a packet is received with a
   Timestamp Ts that lies below Ws, it is rejected as being too old.  If
   Ts lies in between Ws and We it is accepted as a fresh packet.  If Ts
   is in advance of We it is rejected as an invalid time.  However, the
   reason for rejection (being too old or invalid) MUST NOT be
   discernible to any entity other than the receiver who rejected the
   packet.

                         Reject  | Accept |   Reject
                        (Replay) |        | (Invalid)
                     -------------------------------->
                     t           Ws   |   We
                                      |
                                      Tr

                       Figure 2: D3P Sliding Window

   Decapsulation happens as follows.  When IP-D3P follows an IP header
   (e.g., IPsec Transport Mode) the Next Header value in the IP-D3P
   header is placed in the IP header in place of TBD-1.  The IP-D3P
   header is then removed from the packet.  New Total Length and
   checksum fields of the IP header are also restored by the receiver.
   In the case of an IP-IP encapsulated packet, the IP-D3P header is
   simply discarded and processing continues on the encapsulated IP
   packet.

3.  IP-D3P and IPsec

   When IP-D3P is defined as part of the policy, it is applied before
   ESP or AH processing.  Another instance of this approach is IPcomp
   [RFC3173].  Using IP-D3P with IPsec is particularly useful to protect
   group communications when the use of single-sender Security
   Associations (SAs) is not possible, and thus IPsec replay protection
   is not available (Section 2.2 of [RFC4303]).  This has been a
   particular problem when applying IPsec to routing protocols using
   multicast communications (e.g., OSPF [RFC4552] and PIM [RFC4601] ),
   where maintaining an IPsec SA for each sender in not always feasible.
   Additionally, for operational reasons IPsec SAs and keying material
   are often manually configured for these routing protocols, in which
   case the use of IPsec replay protection in not possible.  The use of
   IP-D3P does not replace this missing replay protection, but can
   effectively bound the lifetime of a replayed packet.

   When IP-D3P is applied as part of IPsec transport mode encapsulation,
   the IP-D3P encapsulation is added as the first Protocol following the
   IP header as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.  Several IP header
   fields need to be adjusting when adding the IP-D3P header: Total
   Length is adjusted to the original length of the payload, the
   Protocol field (IPv4 header) or Next Header field (IPv6) is set to
   TBD-1 identifying IP-D3P as the next protocol, and the header
   checksum is adjusted.

   When IP-D3P is applied as part of IPsec tunnel mode encapsulation,
   the IP-D3P encapsulation is added immediately after the outer IP
   header, such that the inner IP header is fully encapsulated.  This is
   shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.  The Protocol field in the outer IPv4
   header or Next Header field in the outer IPv6 header is set to TBD-1,
   indicating that an IP-D3P datagram follows.

4.  Policy Distribution using Group Domain of Interpretation

   The Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) [RFC6407] is a group key
   management protocol used to distribute group policy and keying
   material to a set of Group Members (GMs).  When groups using GDOI key
   management services require the use of IP-D3P, GDOI distributes this
   policy in a Group Associated Policy (GAP) payload using the D3P-TYPE
   attribute.  This attribute indicates the use of IP-D3P for all SA
   TEKs distributed within the SA payload, and defines the Type of
   timestamp that is to be placed into datagrams matching those SA TEKs.
   Value for the D3P-TYPE attribute are taken from the IP-D3P Type
   Registry.

   The GDOI KS policy can also define the size of the time window using
   the GAP payload D3P-WINDOWSIZE attribute.  The value of the attribute
   is in the units defined by the Type.  For example, for the POSIX-
   TIME-SEC attribute the value is in seconds.  If the D3P-TYPE is sent
   without an accompanying D3P-WINDOWSIZE attribute then window size is
   chosen by the receiver.

5.  Security Considerations

   IP-D3P provides an indication of freshness an IP packet rather than
   an absolute detection of all replays.

   In networks where active attackers are anticipated, packets including
   an IP-D3P header SHOULD be protected by an IPsec transform.  IPsec
   integrity protection defends against active man in the middle
   attackers changing the timestamp, and making it appear to be stale or
   invalid.

   The Types defined in this memo all use the system clock.  In many
   cases, the system clock is set from an external protocol (e.g., NTP
   [RFC5905]), and indeed this will maximize the likelihood that the
   system clocks of both sender and receiver are synchronized.  However,
   care should be taken that external protocol is resistant to a man in
   the middle attack.  For example, NTP packets could be distributed
   within an independent well-protected network believed not available

6.  IANA Considerations

   A new IP Protocol is defined for IP-D3P (value TBD-1).

   A new IP-D3P Type registry is created.  Values for this attribute are
   shown in the following table.  The terms Reserved and Unassigned are
   to be applied as defined in [RFC5226].

                     Value           Type
                     ------          ----
                       0             Reserved
                       1             POSIX-TIME-SEC
                       2             POSIX-TIME-DECISEC
                       3             POSIX-TIME-MSEC
                      4-128          Unassigned
                     129-255         Private Use

   The following additions are made to the GDOI Payloads [GDOI-REG]
   registry.

   Two new attributes are added to the GAP Payload Policy Attributes
   registry.

   o  Attribute type D3P-TYPE is a Basic attribute and takes the value
      of TBD-2.  Valid values come from the IP-D3P Type registry.

   o  Attribute type D3P-WINDOWSIZE is a Variable attribute and takes
      the value of TBD-3.  There are no described set of valid values.
