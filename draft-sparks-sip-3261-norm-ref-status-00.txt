1.  Understanding the normative dependencies in RFC3261

   While discussing how to move forward with the maintenance of the SIP
   protocol, it will be useful to understand the scope and status of the
   normative dependencies in the core documents ([RFC3261] in
   particular).  The kind of work needed to move the protocol to Draft
   Standard is different than the work that would be done refining the
   protocol with the intent to remain at Proposed Standard for another
   interval.

   [RFC2026] states:

      Note: Standards track specifications normally must not depend on
      other standards track specifications which are at a lower maturity
      level or on non standards track specifications other than
      referenced specifications from other standards bodies.

   In other words, any normative references from a Draft Standard must
   be to other Draft or full Standard documents, or come with a strong
   explanation of why a "downref" or an external reference is acceptable
   [RFC3967].

   RFC 3261 normatively depends on SDP (literally [RFC2327], but any
   work would reference the current standard at the time - at the
   moment, that is [RFC4566]).  This is likely to be one of the harder
   dependencies to resolve.  We would either have to progress SDP as a
   prerequisite, find a way to construct the documents to avoid a
   normative reference to SDP, or discover some sort of compromise
   between those extremes.

   RFC 3261 also normatively depends on TLS (again the literal
   reference, [RFC2246], no longer makes sense - the current authority
   is [RFC4346]).  There is precedent for a downref in cases where the
   parts of the referenced documents that are used by the standard are
   believed to be of adequate quality.  In this case, we could make the
   argument that the parts of TLS that are used by this specification
   are well enough specified and of adequate quality to qualify for
   draft standard.  Furthermore, we anticipate being able to demonstrate
   interoperability of SIP's use of TLS with entirely discrete
   implementations (including the implementation of TLS).


2.  Survey of RFC3261 Normative References

   RFC 3261 has 26 direct normative references in the categories
   detailed below.  We will, as part of this exercise, also need to
   understand the indirect references (the normative references in the
   documents below that are not at Draft or above, and the normative

   references those references contain and so on), but this version of
   this document does not attempt to enumerate that closure.

3.  Other dependencies to track

   This survey does not include the dependencies of other RFCs defining
   widely implemented small updates, such as rport [RFC3581] and the
   non-INVITE fixes [RFC4320], that will likely be merged into the core
   specification of SIP however we move forward.
