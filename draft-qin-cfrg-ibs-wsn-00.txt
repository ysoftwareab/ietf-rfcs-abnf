    An Identity-based Security Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks 
                       draft-qin-cfrg-ibs-wsn-00


Abstract

   This document specifies an identity-based security scheme for
   wireless sensor network (WSN) on the basis of Identity-Based
   Encryption (IBE). Each cluster head can perform as a private key
   generator (PKG) in case that the sole PKG is captured, which will
   lead to the whole network disabled. The proposed scheme can reduce
   the consumption of key resources and improve the security of the WSN
   by dispersing PKG function. The analysis shows that the scheme can
   resist various attacks.

1. Introduction

   Originated from the military field, the wireless sensor network (WSN)
   has become a hot academic research topic. Wireless sensor networks
   consist of a large number of tiny sensor nodes with microprocessor.
   Because of the limited resource in each sensor node, volatile network
   topology and openness in wireless channel, WSNs are vulnerable to
   various attacks including eavesdropping, message replay, node capture
   attacks, sybil attack, etc., particularly for the applications where
   wireless sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment or
   used for some crucial purposes. In order to resist these threats,
   recently researchers have proposed a variety of security
   technologies, among that, encryption and signature are two important
   technologies.

   Compared with asymmetric key system, the main benefit of symmetric
   key system is its low computing cost. But the drawback is that it
   needs a key pre-distributed process and does not guaranty a perfect
   connectivity (in random key distribution schemes, neighboring nodes
   share a common key in terms of probability [EG]). To address the
   problems aforementioned, researchers have been investigating more
   efficient techniques of Public Key Cryptographic (PKC) in sensor
   networks.

   However, PKC usually needs a public key infrastructure (PKI) to
   maintain the users' certificates for public keys. Besides, the
   computation consumption and energy costs are high because the
   certificates need to be verified in these protocols. To address such
   problems, Shamir proposed the idea of identity-based public-key
   cryptosystems[SHA] which simplified the certificate management.
   Shamir's original motivation for suggesting identity-based encryption
   was to simplify certificate management in e-mail systems. Soon after,
   various identity-based techniques were proposed, but a fully
   functional identity-based encryption scheme has not been found until
   recently by Boneh and Franklin [BF]. Since then the ideas of IBE have
   been used to design several other identity-based schemes for
   different purposes. 

   The disadvantage of the current identity-based system lies in the
   fact that the nodes' private key must be generated by the Key
   Generator Center (KGC), which becomes the single point of failure in
   WSNs. Once KGC is compromised, the network would be almost entirely
   captured by the attacker. 

   This document specifies an identity-based security scheme for WSNs in
   which each cluster head can perform as a KGC so as to improve the
   security. It includes four procedures, i.e., initialization,
   clustering, parameter distribution and data aggregation. Each node

   gets its private key from the cluster head which acts as KGC.
   Analysis is given which shows our scheme can resist various attacks
   to provide a strong protection in WSNs.

   There are two types of WSN architectures available for WSN, one is
   the hierarchical architecture and the other is the distributed flat
   architecture. In this document we focus on the hierarchical
   architecture.

   In a hierarchical wireless sensor network, all nodes are classified
   into three categories: base station, cluster heads and sensor nodes.
   A base station/sink node (BS) is typically a gateway to another
   network. It collects sensor node readings, performs costly operations
   for sensor nodes and manages the network. It is assumed to be trusted
   and be the center of the entire network. In contrast, sensor nodes
   are with limited battery power, memory size, data processing
   capability and short radio transmission range. Cluster heads have
   more resources than ordinary nodes which are equipped with high power
   batteries, large memory storage, powerful antenna and data processing
   capabilities.

   In our scheme, we choose the cluster head within a certain distance
   in case that the cluster head consumes more energy during
   communicating with base station. Each sensor node in the same cluster
   has the same opportunity to be chosen as cluster head. Periodic
   replacement of cluster head can avoid the death of the main nodes,
   and guarantee the connectivity of WSNs.

4. Identity-based Security Scheme

4.1. Initialization phase

   Base station (BS) randomly chooses an elliptic curve E in finite
   field F(p)and a point P in the elliptic curve E before the nodes
   deployment. The master key s is only known by the base station. All
   nodes preset the same parameters(q,G1,G2,e,n,r,P_pub,H1,H2), where q
   is a prime number, G1 and G2 are two groups of order q, e:G1*G1->G2
   is a bilinear map, n is the length of hash function, r is used to
   calculate the mapping value of the public key, P is a random point in
   elliptic curve E, H1 and H2 denote two different hash functions,
   P_pub=s*P is the public value, PU_i=H1(ID_i) is the public key and
   PR_i=s*PU_i is the private key of node i. BS computes private key and
   then preloads it into each node.

4.2. Clustering phase

   By default BS is deployed at the center of the region and all nodes
   are randomly deployed in the monitoring field. According to the
   geographical position, BS selects n cluster heads and puts all nodes
   into n temporary clusters distributed evenly in geographical
   position. Then, BS generates n random numbers K1,K2,...,Kn as a group
   key of each cluster, distributes Ki to CH_i and stores the
 


<Zhongyuan Qin>        Expires <October 2, 2015>                [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT                   <IBKM>               <January 29, 2015>


   corresponding relationship between K and CH in the list. After that,
   CH needs to register its identity CH_i in BS for the authentications
   of the cluster-heads through base station to ensure the validity of
   CH. At the same time, each CH broadcasts its identity to all nodes in
   its cluster. Sensor node registers its identity to CH after receiving
   the message.

   Each CH performs as the function of private key generator (PKG) which
   selects a random number s_ch to calculate a public value P_ch=s_ch*P.
   CH also calculates public key PU_ch=H1(ID_ch) and private key
   PR_ch=s_ch*PU_ch.

4.3. Parameter distribution

   During this phase, PU_ch and group key K are distributed to the
   sensor nodes in the cluster by the CH. The detail is described as
   follow:

   1. CH chooses a random number sigma and computes public key value
   mapping g_i=H2(e(PU_i,P_pub)^r) for every node in the cluster.

   2. CH constructs a polynomial F(g)=sigma*(sigma*e)^(g-g_i) by using
   g_i and sigma, where e=2.718 is a constant. CH generates the
   ciphertext C=((P_ch xor K)||(sigma xor K)||F(g)) and broadcasts it to
   all sensor nodes in the cluster.

   3. After receiving the broadcast message C=(U||V||F(g)), sensor node
   i computes g_i=H2(e(PU_i,P_pub)^r)and substitutes g_i into the
   polynomial F(g). Node i can get F(g_i)=sigma, V xor sigma=K,K xor
   U=P_ch and uses P_ch to exchange messages between CH and sensor node
   later. The value P_ch changes with the different cluster head, but
   P_pub is always the same.

4.4. Data aggregation phase

   In data aggregation phase, the data collected by sensor nodes is sent
   to CH through multi-hop. Suppose a sensor node belongs to cluster j,
   thus its cluster head is CH_j and group key is Kj. For simplicity we
   use CH and K to represent CH_j and Kj.

   1. Sensor node i generates a random number t and calculates the
   mapping value g=e(PU_ch,P_ch). The ciphertext is C=E(K, ID_i||t*P||(m
   xor H2(g^t))), where K is the group key and m is the collected data.
   Nodes near the CH send message directly to the CH, the other nodes
   far away from CH need multi-hop to deliver the collected information.

   2. After receiving the message C=(M||W||F), CH decrypts ciphertext C
   with group key K and authenticates the ID's legal status in order to

INTERNET DRAFT                   <IBKM>               <January 29, 2015>


   prevent illegal member.

   3. After authenticating, the CH computes e(PR_ch, W) with its private
   key. And the collected data can be computed as m = F xor
   H2(e(PR_ch,W)).

   The correctness cab be proved as following.

   e(PR_ch,W)=e(s_ch*PU_ch,t*P)=e(PU_ch,t*P)^s_ch=e(PU_ch,
   s_ch*P)^t=e(PU_ch, P_ch)^t=g^t

5. Security Considerations

   Former schemes including IBE suffered from this "the security of
   master key" problem [SHA]. Once getting the master key s, adversary
   can easily compute all nodes' private key. In our scheme each cluster
   head acts as a PKG, which changes the situation that there is only
   one PKG in the whole network. 

   The analysis and simulations show that the proposed scheme has high
   ability to resist various attacks and provides strong protection for
   the WSNs.

   Hello Flood Attack: In our scheme, there is no hello message between
   each node at the first time. Instead, CH broadcasts its identity
   after being chosen as the cluster head, BS verifies the nodes in each
   cluster's list and non-CH nodes directly register their identity to
   CH. The session keys are distributed in a group key form.

   Sinkhole Attack: In initialization phase, BS randomly chooses K
   cluster heads based on location. This avoids dividing cluster only
   relying on energy. In a cluster, CH will be periodically changed, and
   the criterions of selecting a new cluster head include energy,
   distance to former cluster head, et al. Therefore it is difficult to
   appear sinkhole attack.

   Sybil Attack: The proposed scheme ensures that each entity in the
   WSNs always has a unique identification and its identity and vicinity
   in terms of transmission range is securely authenticated and
   verified. Each node must register to CH, after that, BS compares the
   list received from every cluster head with its own list. During
   forwarding message, only those sensor nodes with the same group key
   have the right to forward message received.

   Forward Secrecy: Assume that the adversary named Eve achieved the
   group key K, and Eve try to decrypt the eavesdropped ciphertext.
   However, Eve can't get the plaintext M because she cannot get the
   CH's private key PR_ch which is used to generate plaintext M through

   bilinear mapping. In addition, after finishing collecting message,
   group key would be revoked and replaced by a new random number.
