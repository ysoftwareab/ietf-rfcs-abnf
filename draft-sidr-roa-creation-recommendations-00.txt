1.  Introduction

   In the context of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) the
   concept of ROA (rfc roa-xx) consists in a set of IP blocks / maximum
   length for an ASN.  This leads to the routes advertised to validate
   these prefixes to * the maximum length allowed by the configuration
   of the ROA.  In recent years, the use of RPKI has increased
   significantly, this, almost forcing the ISPs to ensure their
   advertisements.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   I have many providers

3.  Creation Criterias

   We will consider some different criterias to create the prefix and
   the maximum length included in the ROAs.

   These different ways to create generate various benefits and
   contraindications classified according to the following:

Internet-Draft        ROA Recommendations for RPKI             August 2014


3.1.  Creation Dedication

   Medium Complexity: The criteria will have a high complexity if the
   scan before the creation of the ROA implies aggregation tasks, many
   consultations and careful research on the structure of BGP
   announcements.

   Low Complexity: The criteria will have a low complexity if the
   process of analyse the creation does not require extensive work and
   research to identify which prefixes should be included in the ROA

3.2.  Maintenance Dedication

   High maintenance dedication

   Low maintenance dedication

3.3.  Security Level

   High Security

   Medium Security

4.  Criteria 1

   Criterion 1: For every advertise in the routing table, ip blocks
   within the same ASN are grouped to create a ROA, the maximum length
   corresponds to the length of the prefix, as it is being advertised.
   Creation dedication: Low. The Low-cost of creation is because the
   creation of the ROA is as simple as reflect (copy) the information in
   the routing table.  Identify the network, the ASN and its source and
   include that information in the ROA.  Cost of maintenance: High.
   Whenever there are changes in the BGP advertisements is necessary to
   update the information ROAs.  When you copy exactly the information
   that is in the routing table whenever it changes, you must update
   ROAs.  Security level: High.  It reflect exactly what is being
   advertised and place the Max Prefix length = length, this authorize
   no other more specific ads for the same AS.

5.  Criteria 2

   Criterion 2: For each network assigned to our organization, identify
   which ASNs announce at least a subset of this network, ip blocks
   within the same ASN are grouped to create a ROA.  The maximum length
   corresponds to the highest prefix length of announced subnets.  Cost
   of creation: Medium.  The cost of creation is medium because the
   creation of the ROA includes a preliminary analysis, identify of all
   our networks, identify all ASNs source and verify which is the

Internet-Draft        ROA Recommendations for RPKI             August 2014


   maximum of the lengths with which networks are advertised regularly.
   Cost of maintenance: Low. By including all networks assigned to our
   organization in the roa, there is no need to modify the ROAs every
   time you start to advertise networks that already have been assigned.
   Security level: Medium.  Unlike the previous case, here we are
   allowing a larger set of networks for been announced.  If there is a
   hijack over my ASN, and a kidnap of my networks is realized, in some
   places the abducted route would be preferred rather than the valid
   route.

6.  Criteria 3

   Criterion 3: For each network assigned to our organization we
   identify which ASNs announce at least a subset of my networks, the
   ip-blocks with the same ASN are grouped to create a ROA for each and
   the maximum length corresponds to 24 in the case of grouped IPv4 and
   48 in the case of IPv6.  Cost of creation: Low. The Low cost is
   because the creation of the ROA it's' reduced to simply identify the
   assigned networks and which ASN's announce their.  Cost of
   maintenance: Low. By including all networks assigned to our
   organization in the roa, there is no need to modify the ROAs every
   time you start to advertise networks that had already assigned, Also
   it is not necessary to edit the ROA if you decide to make more
   specific announcements.  Security level: Medium.  Similar to
   criterion 2 we are allowing a larger set of networks for been
   announced.  If there is a hijack over my ASN, and a kidnap of my
   networks is realized, in some places the abducted route would be
   preferred rather than the valid route.

7.  Resume Table

   Here are the recommendations made in accordance with the criteria and
   organization's classification previously submitted.  For each case
   one of the following values will be assigned: Ideal: The best option
   to apply Recommended: If you choose to implement this approach it is
   a valid and practical option.  Not recommended: Do not apply this
   criterion for this type of organization.  Unknown: We can not
   recommend or not the use of this criterion by lack of information

   Service serving three different RIRs standalone RDAPs while providing
