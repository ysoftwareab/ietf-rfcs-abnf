Abstract

   This document discusses methods available for LDAP server discovery
   and advertisement based on previous IETF and ongoing IETF work.

1. Introduction

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] can be used to
   build "islands" of servers that are not a priori tied into a single
   Directory Information Tree (DIT). In this case, it is necessary to
   determine how a client can discover an LDAP server and how LDAP
   servers can discover each other's existence. This documents discusses
   the methods available based on current and previous IETF work.

2. Server Discovery of Other Servers

   A LDAP server discovers other LDAP servers by either using a proposed
   naming scheme and the DNS or by using a additional server to server

   indexing protocol.  Once a server discovers other servers it can
   collect information for returning LDAP v3 referrals to clients.

2.1. Discovery via DNS

   An LDAP server may either be registered using SRV records [2] or, if
   an LDAP server uses the "dc-naming" scheme [3], it can attempt to
   find the server managing its parent node by using DNS to look for the
   LDAP server for the parent domain. Additionally, an LDAP server may
   be named using a common alias as described in [4]. As an example, a
   server in domain foo.bar.com would first look for a SRV record for
   ldap.tcp.foo.bar.com, then for a SRV record for ldap.tcp.bar.com. If
   no SRV records were found, then the server would follow [4] by
   looking for ldap.foo.bar.com and lastly, for ldap.bar.com.

2.2. Discovery via the Common Indexing Protocol [5], [6]

   Independent of what DIT we are managing, LDAP servers could export
   index information about their portion of the tree via the Common
   Indexing Protocol.  This requires some a priori discovery and set up
   of the index mesh.

3. Client Discovery of LDAP Servers

   To discover an LDAP server, clients should follow the sequence of
   steps specified in [7] with the target service being LDAP.
   Alternatively, a client that supports DHCP may use the DHCP extension
   for LDAP server location as specified in [8].

4. Security Considerations

   Since this draft only summarizes available methods, it adds no
   additional security considerations to those inherent in the
   referenced documents.  Implementors are strongly recommended to read
   and follow the security considerations provided in the referenced
   documents.
