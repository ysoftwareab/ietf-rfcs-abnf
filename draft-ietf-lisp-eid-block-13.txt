Abstract

   This is a direction to IANA to allocate a /32 IPv6 prefix for use
   with the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).  The prefix will be
   used for local intra-domain routing and global endpoint
   identification, by sites deploying LISP as EID (Endpoint IDentifier)
   addressing space.

Internet-Draft               LISP EID Block                February 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document directs the IANA to allocate a /32 IPv6 prefix for use
   with the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP - [RFC6830]), LISP Map
   Server ([RFC6833]), LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+ALT - [RFC6836])
   (or other) mapping systems, and LISP Interworking ([RFC6832]).

   This block will be used as global Endpoint IDentifier (EID) space.


2.  Definition of Terms

   The present document does not introduce any new term with respect to
   the set of LISP Specifications ( [RFC6830], [RFC6831], [RFC6832],
   [RFC6833], [RFC6834], [RFC6835], [RFC6836], [RFC6837]), but assumes
   that the reader is familiar with the LISP terminology.
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction] provides an introduction to the LISP
   technology, including its terminology.


3.  Rationale and Intent

   Discussion within the LISP Working Group led to identify several
   scenarios in which the existence of a LISP specific address block
   brings technical benefits.  Hereafter the most relevant scenarios are
   described:

   Early LISP destination detection:  With the current specifications,
         there is no direct way to detect whether or not a certain
         destination is in a LISP domain or not without performing a
         LISP mapping lookup.  For instance, if an ITR is sending to all
         types of destinations (i.e., non-LISP destinations, LISP
         destinations not in the IPv6 EID block, and LISP destinations
         in the IPv6 EID block) the only way to understand whether or
         not to encapsulate the traffic is to perform a cache lookup
         and, in case of a LISP Cache miss, send a Map-Request to the
         mapping system.  In the meanwhile (waiting the Map-Reply),
         packets may be dropped in order to avoid excessive buffering.

   Avoid penalizing non-LISP traffic:  In certain circumstances it might
         be desirable to configure a router using LISP features to
         natively forward all packets that have not a destination
         address in the block, hence, no lookup whatsoever is performed
         and packets destined to non-LISP sites are not penalized in any
         manner.

Internet-Draft               LISP EID Block                February 2016


   Traffic Engineering:  In some deployment scenarios it might be
         desirable to apply different traffic engineering policies for
         LISP and non-LISP traffic.  A LISP specific EID block would
         allow improved traffic engineering capabilities with respect to
         LISP vs. non-LISP traffic.  In particular, LISP traffic might
         be identified without having to use DPI techniques in order to
         parse the encapsulated packet, performing instead a simple
         inspection of the outer header is sufficient.

   Transition Mechanism:  The existence of a LISP specific EID block may
         prove useful in transition scenarios.  A non-LISP domain would
         ask for an allocation in the LISP EID block and use it to
         deploy LISP in its network.  Such allocation will not be
         announced in the BGP routing infrastructure (cf., Section 4).
         This approach will allow non-LISP domains to avoid fragmenting
         their already allocated non-LISP addressing space, which may
         lead to BGP routing table inflation since it may (rightfully)
         be announced in the BGP routing infrastructure.

   Limit the impact on BGP routing infrastructure:  As described in the
         previous scenario, LISP adopters will avoid fragmenting their
         addressing space, since fragmentation would negatively impact
         the BGP routing infrastructure.  Adopters will use addressing
         space from the EID block, which might be announced in large
         aggregates and in a tightly controlled manner only by proxy
         xTRs.

   Is worth mentioning that new use cases can arise in the future, due
   to new and unforeseen scenarios.

   Furthermore, the use of a dedicated address block will give a tighter
   control, especially filtering, over the traffic in the initial
   experimental phase, while facilitating its large-scale deployment.

   [RFC3692] considers assigning experimental and testing numbers
   useful, and the request of a reserved IPv6 prefix is a perfect match
   of such practice.  The present document follows the guidelines
   provided in [RFC3692], with one exception.  [RFC3692] suggests the
   use of values similar to those called "Private Use" in [RFC5226],
   which by definition are not unique.  One of the purposes of the
   present request to IANA is to guarantee uniqueness to the EID block.
   The lack thereof would result in a lack of real utility of a reserved
   IPv6 prefix.


4.  Expected use

   Sites planning to deploy LISP may request a prefix in the IPv6 EID



Iannone, et al.          Expires August 29, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               LISP EID Block                February 2016


   block.  Such prefixes will be used for routing and endpoint
   identification inside the site requesting it.  Mappings related to
   such prefix, or part of it, will be made available through the
   mapping system in use and registered to one or more Map Server(s).

   The EID block must be used for LISP experimentation and must not be
   advertised in the form of more specific route advertisements in the
   non-LISP inter-domain routing environment.  Interworking between the
   EID block sub-prefixes and the non-LISP Internet is done according to
   [RFC6832] and [RFC7215].

   As the LISP adoption progresses, the EID block may potentially have a
   reduced impact on the BGP routing infrastructure, compared to the
   case of having the same number of adopters using global unicast space
   allocated by RIRs ([MobiArch2007]).  From a short-term perspective,
   the EID block offers potentially large aggregation capabilities since
   it is announced by PxTRs possibly concentrating several contiguous
   prefixes.  This trend should continue with even lower impact from a
   long-term perspective, since more aggressive aggregation can be used,
   potentially leading at using few PxTRs announcing the whole EID block
   ([FIABook2010]).

   The EID block will be used only at configuration level, it is
   recommended not to hard-code in any way the IPv6 EID block in the
   router hardware.  This allows avoiding locking out sites that may
   want to switch to LISP while keeping their own IPv6 prefix, which is
   not in the IPv6 EID block.  Furthermore, in the case of a future
   permanent allocation, the allocated prefix may differ from the
   experimental temporary prefix allocated during the experimentation
   phase.

   With the exception of PITR case (described in Section 8) prefixes out
   of the EID block must not be announced in the BGP routing
   infrastructure.


5.  Block Dimension

   The working group reached consensus on an initial allocation of a /32
   prefix.  The reason of such consensus is manifold:

   o  The working group agreed that /32 prefix is sufficiently large to
      cover initial allocation and requests for prefixes in the EID
      space in the next few years for very large-scale experimentation
      and deployment.

   o  As a comparison, it is worth mentioning that the current LISP Beta
      Network ([BETA]) is using a /32 prefix, with more than 250 sites



Iannone, et al.          Expires August 29, 2016                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               LISP EID Block                February 2016


      using a /48 sub prefix.  Hence, a /32 prefix appears sufficiently
      large to allow the current deployment to scale up and be open for
      interoperation with independent deployments using EIDs in the new
      /32 prefix.

   o  A /32 prefix is sufficiently large to allow deployment of
      independent (commercial) LISP enabled networks by third parties,
      but may as well boost LISP experimentation and deployment.

   o  The use of a /32 prefix is in line with previous similar prefix
      allocation for tunneling protocols ([RFC3056]).


6.  3+3 Allocation Plan

   This document requests IANA to initially assign a /32 prefix out of
   the IPv6 addressing space for use as EID in LISP (Locator/ID
   Separation Protocol).

   IANA allocates the requested address space by MMMM/YYYY0 for a
   duration of 3 (three) initial years (through MMMM/YYYY3), with an
   option to extend this period by 3 (three) more years (until MMMM/
   YYYY6).  By the end of the first period, the IETF will provide a
   decision on whether to transform the prefix in a permanent assignment
   or to put it back in the free pool (see Section 7 for more
   information).

   [RFC Editor: please replace MMMM and all its occurrences in the
   document with the month of publication as RFC.]

   [RFC Editor: please replace YYYY0 and all its occurrences in the
   document with the year of publication as RFC.]

   [RFC Editor: please replace YYYY3 and all its occurrences in the
   document with the year of publication as RFC plus 3 years, e.g., if
   published in 2016 then put 2019.]

   [RFC Editor: please replace YYYY6 and all its occurrences in the
   document with the year of publication as RFC plus 6 years, e.g., if
   published in 2016 then put 2022.]

   In the first case, i.e., if the IETF decides to transform the block
   in a permanent allocation, the EID block allocation period will be
   extended for three years (until MMMM/YYYY6) so to give time to the
   IETF to define the final size of the EID block and create a
   transition plan.  The transition of the EID block into a permanent
   allocation has the potential to pose policy issues (as recognized in
   [RFC2860], section 4.3) and hence discussion with the IANA, the RIR



Iannone, et al.          Expires August 29, 2016                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               LISP EID Block                February 2016


   communities, and the IETF community will be necessary to determine
   appropriate policy for permanent EID block allocation and management.
   Note as well that the final permanent allocation may differ from the
   initial experimental assignment, hence, it is recommended not to
   hard-code in any way the experimental EID block on LISP-capable
   devices.

   In the latter case, i.e., if the IETF decides to stop the EID block
   experimental use, by MMMM/YYYY3 all temporary prefix allocations in
   such address range must expire and be released, so that the entire
   /32 is returned to the free pool.

   The allocation and management of the EID block for the initial 3
   years period (and the optional 3 more years) is detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block-mgmnt].


7.  Allocation Lifetime

   If no explicit action is carried out by the end of the experiment (by
   MMMM/YYYY3) it is automatically considered that there was no
   sufficient interest in having a permanent allocation and the address
   block will be returned to the free pool.

   Otherwise, if the LISP Working Group recognizes that there is value
   in having a permanent allocation then explicit action is needed.

   In order to trigger the process for a permanent allocation a document
   is required.  Such document has to articulate the rationale why a
   permanent allocation would be beneficial.  More specifically, the
   document has to detail the experience gained during experimentation
   and all of the technical benefits provided by the use of a LISP
   specific prefix.  Such technical benefits are expected to lay in the
   scenarios described in Section 3, however, new unforeseen benefits
   may appear during experimentation.  The description should be
   sufficiently articulate so to allow to provide an estimation of what
   should be the size of the permanent allocation.  Note however that,
   as explained in Section 6, it is up to IANA to decide which address
   block will be used as permanent allocation and that such block may be
   different from the temporary experimental allocation.


8.  Routing Considerations

   In order to provide connectivity between the Legacy Internet and LISP
   sites, PITRs announcing large aggregates (ideally one single large
   aggregate) of the IPv6 EID block could be deployed.  By doing so,
   PITRs will attract traffic destined to LISP sites in order to



Iannone, et al.          Expires August 29, 2016                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               LISP EID Block                February 2016


   encapsulate and forward it toward the specific destination LISP site.
   Routers in the Legacy Internet must treat announcements of prefixes
   from the IPv6 EID block as normal announcements, applying best
   current practice for traffic engineering and security.

   Even in a LISP site, not all routers need to run LISP elements.  In
   particular, routers that are not at the border of the local domain,
   used only for intra-domain routing, do not need to provide any
   specific LISP functionality but must be able to route traffic using
   addresses in the IPv6 EID block.

   For the above-mentioned reasons, routers that do not run any LISP
   element, must not include any special handling code or hardware for
   addresses in the IPv6 EID block.  In particular, it is recommended
   that the default router configuration does not handle such addresses
   in any special way.  Doing differently could prevent communication
   between the Legacy Internet and LISP sites or even break local intra-
   domain connectivity.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security threats in the LISP
   architecture nor in the legacy Internet architecture.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document instructs the IANA to assign a /32 IPv6 prefix for use
   as the global LISP EID space using a hierarchical allocation as
   outlined in [RFC5226] and summarized in Table 1.

   This document does not specify any specific value for the requested
   address block but suggests that should come from the 2000::/3 Global
   Unicast Space.  IANA is not requested to issue an AS0 ROA (Route
   Origin Attestation [RFC6491]), since the Global EID Space will be
   used for routing purposes.

    [1] According to the 3+3 Plan outlined in this document termination
    date can be postponed to MMMM/YYYY6. [2] Can be used as a multicast
   source as well. [3] To be used as EID space by LISP [RFC6830] enabled
                                 routers.

                         Table 1: Global EID Space

   [IANA: Please update the Termination Date and footnote [1] in the
   Special-Purpose Address Registry when the I-D is published as RFC.]

   The reserved address space is requested for a period of time of three
   initial years starting in MMMM/YYYY0 (until MMMM/YYYY3), with an
   option to extend it by three years (until MMMM/YYYY6) up on decision
   of the IETF (see Section 6 and Section 7).  Following the policies
   outlined in [RFC5226], upon IETF Review, by MMMM/YYYY3 decision
   should be made on whether to have a permanent EID block assignment.
   If no explicit action is taken or if the IETF review outcome will be
   that is not worth to have a reserved prefix as global EID space, the
   whole /32 will be taken out from the IPv6 Special Purpose Address
   Registry and put back in the free pool managed by IANA.

   Allocation and management of the Global EID Space is detailed in a
   different document.  Nevertheless, all prefix allocations out of this
   space must be temporary and no allocation must go beyond MMMM/YYYY3
   unless the IETF Review decides for a permanent Global EID Space
   assignment.
