  ECC Brainpool Curves for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Version 1.3
                 draft-bruckert-brainpool-for-tls13-05

Abstract

   ECC Brainpool curves were an option for authentication and key
   exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2,
   but were deprecated by the IETF for use with TLS version 1.3 because
   they had little usage.  There are no security concerns in using the
   ECC Brainpool Curves, and there is some interest in using several of
   these curves in TLS 1.3.

   This document provides the necessary protocol mechanisms for using
   ECC Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3.  This approach is not endorsed by
   the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5639] specifies a new set of elliptic curve groups over finite
   prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  These groups,
   denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a verifiably
   pseudo-random way and comply with the security requirements of
   relevant standards from ISO [ISO1] [ISO2], ANSI [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS],
   and SecG [SEC2].

   [RFC8422] defines the usage of elliptic curves for authentication and
   key agreement in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions, and [RFC7027] defines
   the usage of the ECC Brainpool curves for authentication and key
   exchange in TLS.  The latter is applicable to TLS 1.2 and earlier
   versions, but not to TLS 1.3 that deprecates the ECC Brainpool Curve
   IDs defined in [RFC7027] due to the lack of widespread deployment
   However, there is some interest in using these curves in TLS 1.3.

   The negotiation of ECC Brainpool Curves for key exchange in TLS 1.3
   according to [RFC8446] requires the definition and assignment of
   additional NamedGroup IDs.  This document provides the necessary
   definition and assignment of additional SignatureScheme IDs for using
   three ECC Brainpool Curves from [RFC5639].

   This approach is not endorsed by the IETF.  Implementers and
   deployers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of all
   security mechanisms that they use.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Brainpool NamedGroup Types

   According to [RFC8446], the name space NamedGroup is used for the
   negotiation of elliptic curve groups for key exchange during a
   handshake starting a new TLS session.  This document adds new
   NamedGroup types to three elliptic curves defined in [RFC5639] as
   follows.

           enum {
                brainpoolP256r1tls13(31),
                brainpoolP384r1tls13(32),
                brainpoolP512r1tls13(33)
           } NamedGroup;

   The encoding of ECDHE parameters for sec256r1, secp384r1, and
   secp521r1 as defined in section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446] also applies to
   this document.

   Test vectors for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using these elliptic
   curves are provided in Appendix A.

4.  Brainpool SignatureScheme Types

   According to [RFC8446], the name space SignatureScheme is used for
   the negotiation of elliptic curve groups for authentication via the
   "signature_algorithms" extension.  This document adds new
   SignatureScheme types to three elliptic curves defined in [RFC5639]
   as follows.

           enum {
                ecdsa_brainpoolP256r1tls13_sha256(0x081A),
                ecdsa_brainpoolP384r1tls13_sha384(0x081B),
                ecdsa_brainpoolP512r1tls13_sha512(0x081C)
           } SignatureScheme;

   This notation is used to clarify that an ECDSA signature is
   calculated over the hashed message.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8446] apply accordingly.

   The confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the TLS
   communication is limited by the weakest cryptographic primitive
   applied.  In order to achieve a maximum security level when using one
   of the elliptic curves from Table 1 for key exchange and / or one of
   the signature algorithms from Table 2 for authentication in TLS, the
   key derivation function, the algorithms and key lengths of symmetric
   encryption and message authentication as well as the algorithm, bit

   length and hash function used for signature generation should be
   chosen according to the recommendations of [NIST800-57] and
   [RFC5639].  Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman keys should be
   generated from a random keystream with a length equal to the length
   of the order of the group E(GF(p)) defined in [RFC5639].  The value
   of the private Diffie-Hellman keys should be less than the order of
   the group E(GF(p)).

   When using ECDHE key agreement with the curves brainpoolP256r1tls13,
   brainpoolP384r1tls13 or brainpoolP512r1tls13, the peers MUST validate
   each other's public value Q by ensuring that the point is a valid
   point on the elliptic curve.

   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for TLS may be
   susceptible to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken
   for implementations that internally transform curve points to points
   on the corresponding "twisted curve", using the map (x',y') = (x*Z^2,
   y*Z^3) with the coefficient Z specified for that curve in [RFC5639],
   in order to take advantage of an an efficient arithmetic based on the
   twisted curve's special parameters (A = -3): although the twisted
   curve itself offers the same level of security as the corresponding
   random curve (through mathematical equivalence), arithmetic based on
   small curve parameters may be harder to protect against side-channel
   attacks.  General guidance on resistence of elliptic curve
   cryptography implementations against side-channel-attacks is given in
   [BSI1] and [HMV].

   This non-normative Appendix provides some test vectors for example
   Diffie-Hellman key exchanges using each of the curves defined in
   Table 1 .  In all of the following sections the following notation is
   used:

      d_A: the secret key of party A

      x_qA: the x-coordinate of the public key of party A

      y_qA: the y-coordinate of the public key of party A

      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation

   The field elements x_qA, y_qA, x_qB, y_qB, x_Z, y_Z are represented
