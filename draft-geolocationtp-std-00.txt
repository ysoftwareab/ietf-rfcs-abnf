1. Introduction

    
    This document describes the need for a Geo location based transport protocol
2. Background
	Right now itâ€™s possible to get information about the geographical location of the website viewers. I propose another transport protocol that takes a Geo location a roaming or static phone number or device mac or even an Internet unique identity and returns the http or other services list in that area that can be used from the browser.

3. General Information of the service
	I should be able to type gltp://
An iP address
A Geo location
A phone number roaming or static
A device mac address
An Internet unique name or identity
And the browser should return the list of services around that area.
