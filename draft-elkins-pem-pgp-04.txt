Abstract

     This document describes how Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) can be used to
     provide privacy and authentication using the Multipurpose Internet
     Mail Extensions (MIME) security content types described in RFC1847.

1.  Introduction

     Previous work on integrating PGP with MIME (including the since
     withdrawn application/pgp content type) has suffered from a number
     of problems, the most significant of which is the inability to
     recover signed message bodies without parsing data structures
     specific to PGP.  This work makes use of the elegant solution
     proposed in RFC1847, which defines security multipart formats for
     MIME. The security multiparts clearly separate the signed message
     body from the signature, and have a number of other desirable
     properties. This document is styled after RFC 1848, which defines
     MIME Object Security Services (MOSS) for providing security and
     authentication.

     This document defines three new content types for implementing
     security and privacy with PGP: application/pgp-encrypted,
     application/pgp-signature and application/pgp-keys.

1.1  Compliance

     In order for an implementation to be compliant with this
     specification, is it absolutely necessary for it to obey all items
     labeled as MUST or REQUIRED.

2.  PGP data formats

     PGP can generate either ASCII armor (described in [3]) or 8-bit
     binary output when encrypting data, generating a digital signature,
     or extracting public key data.  The ASCII armor output is the
     REQUIRED method for data transfer.  This allows those users who do
     not have the means to interpret the formats described in this
     document to be able extract and use the PGP information in the
     message.

     When the amount of data to be transmitted requires that it be sent
     in many parts, the MIME message/partial mechanism should be used
     rather than the multipart ASCII armor PGP format.

3.  Content-Transfer-Encoding restrictions

     Multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted are to be treated by agents
     as opaque, meaning that the data is not to be altered in any way
     [1].  However, many existing mail gateways will detect if the next
     hop does not support MIME or 8-bit data and perform conversion to
     either Quoted-Printable or Base64.  This presents serious problems
     for multipart/signed, in particular, where the signature is
     invalidated when such an operation occurs.  For this reason all data
     signed according to this protocol MUST be constrained to 7 bits (8-
     bit data should be encoded using either Quoted-Printable or Base64).
     Note that this also includes the case where a signed object is also
     encrypted (see section 6).  This restriction will increase the
     likelihood that the signature will be valid upon receipt.

     Data that is ONLY to be encrypted is allowed to contain 8-bit
     characters and therefore need not be converted to a 7-bit format.

          Implementor's note: It cannot be stressed enough that
          applications using this standard should follow MIME's
          suggestion that you "be conservative in what you generate, and
          liberal in what you accept."  In this particular case it means
          it would be wise for an implementation to accept messages with
          any content-transfer-encoding, but restrict generation to the

          7-bit format required by this memo.  This will allow future
          compatibility in the event the Internet SMTP framework becomes
          8-bit friendly.

4.  PGP encrypted data

     Before encryption with PGP, the data should be written in MIME
     canonical format (body and headers).

     PGP encrypted data is denoted by the "multipart/encrypted" content
     type, described in [1], and MUST have a "protocol" parameter value
     of "application/pgp-encrypted".  Note that the value of the
     parameter MUST be enclosed in quotes.

     The multipart/encrypted MUST consist of exactly two parts.  The
     first MIME body part must have a content type of "application/pgp-
     encrypted".  This body contains the control information.  A message
     complying with this standard MUST contain a "Version: 1" field in
     this body.  Since the PGP packet format contains all other
     information necessary for decrypting, no other information is
     required here.

     The second MIME body part MUST contain the actual encrypted data.
     It must be labeled with a content type of "application/octet-
     stream".

5.  PGP signed data

     PGP signed messages are denoted by the "multipart/signed" content
     type, described in [1], with a "protocol" parameter which MUST have
     a value of "application/pgp-signature" (MUST be quoted).  The
     "micalg" parameter MUST have a value of "pgp-<hash-symbol>", where
     <hash-symbol> identifies the message integrity check (MIC) used to
     generate the signature.  The currently defined values for <hash-
     symbol> are "md5" for the MD5 checksum, and "sha1" for the SHA.1
     algorithm.

     The multipart/signed body MUST consist of exactly two parts.  The
     first part contains the signed data in MIME canonical format,
     including a set of appropriate content headers describing the data.

     The second body MUST contain the PGP digital signature.  It MUST be
     labeled with a content type of "application/pgp-signature".

     When the PGP digital signature is generated:

     (1)  The data to be signed must first be converted to its
          type/subtype specific canonical form.  For text/plain, this
          means conversion to an appropriate character set and conversion
          of line endings to the canonical <CR><LF> sequence.

     (2)  An appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding is then applied. Each
          line of the encoded data MUST end with the canonical <CR><LF>
          sequence.

     (3)  MIME content headers are then added to the body, each ending
          with the canonical <CR><LF> sequence.

     (4)  As described in [1], the digital signature MUST be calculated
          over both the data to be signed and its set of content headers.

     (5)  The signature MUST be generated detached from the signed data
          so that the process does not alter the signed data in any way.

     The "&"s in the previous example indicate the portion of the data
     over which the signature was calculated.

     Though not required, it is generally a good idea to use Quoted-
     Printable encoding in the first step (writing out the data to be
     signed in MIME canonical format) if any of the lines in the data
     begin with "From ", and encode the "F".  This will avoid an MTA
     inserting a ">" in front of the line, thus invalidating the
     signature!

     Upon receipt of a signed message, an application MUST:

     (1)  Convert line endings to the canonical <CR><LF> sequence before
          the signature can be verified.  This is necessary since the
          local MTA may have converted to a local end of line convention.

     (2)  Pass both the signed data and its associated content headers
          along with the PGP signature to the signature verification
          service.

6.  Encrypted and Signed Data

     Sometimes it is desirable to both digitally sign and then encrypt a
     message to be sent.  This protocol allows for two methods of
     accomplishing this task.

6.1  RFC1847 Encapsulation

     In [1], it is stated that the data should first be signed as a
     multipart/signature body, and then encrypted to form the final
     multipart/encrypted body, i.e.,

          Content-Type: multipart/encrypted;
              protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"; boundary=foo

          --foo
          Content-Type: application/pgp-encrypted

          Version: 1

          --foo
          Content-Type: application/octet-stream

          -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
          & Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=pgp-md5
          &     protocol="application/pgp-signature"; boundary=bar
          &
          & --bar
          & Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
          &
          & This message was first signed, and then encrypted.
          &
          & --bar
          & Content-Type: application/pgp-signature
          &
          & -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
          & Version: 2.6.2
          &

          &
          & --bar--
          -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

          --foo--

          (The text preceded by '&' indicates that it is really
          encrypted, but presented as text for clarity.)

6.2  Combined method

     Versions 2.x of PGP also allow data to be signed and encrypted in
     one operation.  This method is an acceptable shortcut, and has the
     benefit of less overhead.  The resulting data should be formed as a
     "multipart/encrypted" object as described above.

     Messages which are encrypted and signed in this combined fashion are
     REQUIRED to follow the same canonicalization rules as for
     multipart/signed objects.

     It is explicitly allowed for an agent to decrypt a combined message
     and rewrite it as a multipart/signed object using the signature data
     embedded in the encrypted version.

7.  Distribution of PGP public keys

     Content-Type: application/pgp-keys
     Required parameters: none
     Optional parameters: none

     This is the content type which should be used for relaying public
     key blocks.

8.  Notes

     PGP and Pretty Good Privacy are trademarks of Philip Zimmermann.

9.  Security Considerations

     Use of this protocol has the same security considerations as PGP,
     and is not known to either increase or decrease the security of
     messages using it; see [3] for more information.
