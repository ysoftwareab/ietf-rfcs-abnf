                IANA registries for LSP ping Code Points
                  draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registry-01

Abstract

   RFC 4379 and RFC 6424 created name spaces for Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping.  However, those RFCs
   did not create the corresponding IANA registries for the Downstream
   Mapping object Flags (DS Flags), Multipath Type, Pad TLV and Address
   Types.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
   name spaces.  This document updates RFC 4379 and RFC 6424 in that it
   creates the IANA registries for that purpose.

Internet-Draft        IANA registries for LSP ping          January 2015

   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents
   (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of
   publication of this document.  Please review these documents

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] created name spaces for MPLS LSP Ping.
   However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries
   for DS Flags, Multipath Type, Pad TLV and Address Types.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
   name spaces.  In particular [I-D.ietf-mpls-entropy-lsp-ping] and
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-lag-multipath]  are requesting allocation for
   DS Flags and Multipath Type.

   This document serves to update [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] in that it
   creates the IANA registries for that purpose.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create new registries within
   [IANA-MPLS-LSP-PING] protocol to maintain "DS Flags", "Multipath
   Type", "Pad TLV" and "Address Types" fields.  Name of registries and
   initial values are described in immediate sub-sections to follow.

2.1.  DS Flags

   [RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping TLV, which has the Type 2
   assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

   [RFC6424] defines the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV, which has the
   Type 20 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

   DSMAP has been deprecated by DDMAP, but both TLVs share a field: "DS
   Flags".

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "DS
   Flags" with the following registration procedure:

               Registry Name: DS Flags.

    Bit number Name                                        Reference
    ---------- ----------------------------------------    ---------
          7    N: Treat as a Non-IP Packet                 RFC4379
          6    I: Interface and Label Stack Object Request RFC4379
        5-0    Unassigned

   Assignments of DS Flags are via Standards Action [RFC5226].

   Note that "DS Flags" is a field included in two TLVs defined in
   "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry: Downstream Mapping TLV (value 2)
   and Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV (value 20).  Modification to "DS
   Flags" registry will affect both TLVs.

2.2.  Multipath Type

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled
   "Multipath Type" with the following registration procedure:

               Registry Name: Multipath Type.

    Value      Meaning                                  Reference
    ---------- ---------------------------------------- ---------
          0    no multipath                             RFC4379
          1    Unassigned
          2    IP address                               RFC4379
          3    Unassigned
          4    IP address range                         RFC4379
        5-7    Unassigned
          8    Bit-masked IP address set                RFC4379
          9    Bit-masked label set                     RFC4379
     10-250    Unassigned
    251-254    Experimental                             This document
        255    Reserved                                 This document


   Assignments of Multipath Types are via Standards Action [RFC5226].

   Note that "Multipath Type" is a field included in two TLVs defined in
   "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry: Downstream Mapping TLV (value 2)
   and Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV (value 20).  Modification to
   "Multipath Type" registry will affect both TLVs.

2.3.  Pad Type

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "Pad
   Type" with the following registration procedure:

               Registry Name: Pad Type.

    Value      Meaning                                  Reference
    ---------- ---------------------------------------- ---------
          0    Reserved                                 RFC4379
          1    Drop Pad TLV from reply                  RFC4379
          2    Copy Pad TLV to reply                    RFC4379
      3-250    Unassigned
    251-254    Experimental                             This document
        255    Reserved                                 This document


   Assignments of Pad Types are via Standards Action [RFC5226].

2.4.  Interface and Label Stack Address Type

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled
   "Interface and Label Stack Address Type" with the following
   registration procedure:

               Registry Name: Interface and Label Stack Address Type.

    Value      Meaning                                  Reference
    ---------- ---------------------------------------- ---------
          0    Reserved                                 RFC4379
          1    IPv4 Numbered                            RFC4379
          2    IPv4 Unnumbered                          RFC4379
          3    IPv6 Numbered                            RFC4379
          4    IPv6 Unnumbered                          RFC4379
      5-250    Unassigned
    251-254    Experimental                             This document
        255    Reserved                                 This document


   Assignments of Interface and Label Stack Address Types are via
   Standards Action [RFC5226].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document simply creates IANA registries for code point defined
   in [RFC4379] and [RFC6424].  Thus, there are no new security
   concerns.
