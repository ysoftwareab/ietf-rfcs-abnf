1.  Introduction

   The [RFC1035] defines couple of old resource records that are not
   being used, and they are causing operational problems between
   implementations that support them and that don't supported them due
   DNS compression on the wire.  This document deprecates such records
   to allow the implementations to drop the specific support for such
   records.

2.  Deprecating MB, MG, MF, MINFO and WKS Resource Records

   The MB, MG, MF, MINFO, and WKS Resource Records aren't used in any
   existing standards, and this documents deprecates the usage.  The DNS
   implementations compliant with this document MUST NOT implement MB,
   MG, MF, WKS, and MINFO Resource Records and treat them as a generic
   type effectively disabling the compression in those types.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This documents updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" ([DNS-IANA]).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has not security considerations.

5.  Operational Considerations

   The various status of implementation of MB, MG, MR, MINFO, and WKS
   records is already causing operational problems between DNS
   implementations that do implement aforementioned types and those who
   don't because of mandatory DNS compression on the wire.  This
   document aims to rectify the situation by removing the support for
   all the DNS implementations.  This should not cause any operational
   problems because the records aren't actually in use on the Internet.
