Internet-Draft       DSR Usage for the VANET Routing        October 2014


Abstract

   This document describes how DSR [1] can be applied in the vehicular
   ad hoc network (VANET) environment. Since DSR uses the source routing
   mechanism, it can be appropriate for the VANET routing mechanisms
   operating based on the source routing. Therefore, in this draft,
   we describe how we can adapt DSR to the VANET environment.

Internet-Draft       DSR Usage for the VANET Routing        October 2014


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a special form of the MANET
   in which vehicles (mobile nodes) move along the given road layout
   [2]. When a route from a source node to a destination node is
   discovered, the obtained route has to be represented with a
   sequence of roads instead of nodes (vehicles) since vehicles move too
   fast. If a route is represented with nodes, the route can be easily
   broken, which incurs too frequent route maintenance procedure.
   In this case, the source routing is appropriate. That is,
   once the route information is obtained, data are sent along
   the roads in the route information and, in the header of each data
   packet, the route information is included. Since DSR [1]
   uses the source routing mechanism, in this draft, we describe
   the issues on applying DSR to the VANET environment.


3.  DSR for the VANET Routing

   In DSR, the route discovery is initiated by the source node's
   broadcasting of an RREQ message. Each intermediate node forwards
   the received RREQ message via broadcast and the route information
   is recorded in the RREQ message. Once the destination node receives
   an RREQ message, it sends out an RREP message with the collected
   route information back to the source. Or, if an intermediate node
   has the route information to the destination, it stops forwarding
   the RREQ message and sends an RREP message back to the source.

   In a VANET, a 'node' is a fast moving vehicle and, as a result,
   the network topology changes drastically. Thus, rather than
   recording the passing-by nodes in the RREQ message, it is better to
   record the passing-by roads in the RREQ message. This may reduce
   the possibility of route maintenance.
    
   In this case, since 'road' is the unit element of the route
   information and there is no representative entity to keep the route
   state of a road, the RREP message has to be generated by only the
   destination node.

Internet-Draft       DSR Usage for the VANET Routing        October 2014


   There can be more than one node on a road, so RREQ messages with
   the same route record can be generated by multiple nodes.
   Therefore, a mechanism to reduce the number of RREQ messages with
   the same route record information is required.

   Also, since a sequence of 'road's represents a route, the automatic
   route shortening, the gratuitous RREP message and the optional flow
   state extension capabilities of DSR may not be necessary. Hence,
   a simplified version of DSR is adequate for the VANET routing.
 
  
4.  Modifications on DSR

   TBD.


5.  Other Considerations

   TBD.
