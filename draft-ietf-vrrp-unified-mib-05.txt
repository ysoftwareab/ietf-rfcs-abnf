Abstract 
    
   This specification defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for 
   use with SNMP-based network management.  In particular, it defines 
   objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that 
   employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for both IPv4 and IPv6 
   as defined in RFC 3768 and RFC xxxx ( RFC-editor, this is currently 
   draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-07.txt).  This memo obsoletes RFC 2787.

1.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
2.   Introduction 
    
   VRRP protocols as defined in RFC 3768 [RFC3768] and RFC xxxx (RFC-
   editor, this is currently draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-07.txt) 
   [VRRPIPv6] are inherently IP version specific.  Though both the 
   protocols are similar, they are not identical and can coexist on a 
   network element. RFC2787 [RFC2787] defines managed objects that are 
   specific to VRRP protocol for IPv4 networks as defined in RFC 3768 
   [RFC3768].  This document defines IP version independent managed 
   objects for configuring and monitoring VRRP protocols. 
    
   VRRP over IPv4 (VRRPv2) and VRRP over IPv6 (VRRPv3) protocols are 
   similar in operation to an extent and hence the MIB defined has 
   common groups that should be implemented by devices running either of 
   the VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  This specification also 
   defines MIB groups that are specific to a particular VRRP protocol 
   and should only be implemented in devices supporting the specified 
   version of VRRP protocol. 
    
3.   Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
 
4.   Relationship to RFC 2787 
    
   RFC2787 [RFC2787] defines managed objects for VRRP over IPv4 and has 
   been deprecated by this memo. 
    
5.   Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB) 
Tata                                                            [Page 2] 
Internet-Draft              VRRP unified MIB                 April 2006 

    
   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more physical 
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in 
   the VRRP MIB. 
    
6.   Multi-Stack Implementations 
    
   This MIB is designed to support Multi-Stack implementations that run 
   VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IP version, VRID and ifIndex are 
   used to uniquely identify rows in a multi stack implementation. 
    
7.   VRRP MIB Structure 
    
   The VRRP MIB contains three groups: 
      - vrrpOperations Group: Objects related to VRRP router's 
        configuration and control. 
      - vrrpStatistics Group: Objects containing information useful in 
        monitoring the operation of VRRP routers. 
      - vrrpNotifications Group: Consists of objects and definitions 
        for use in SNMP notifications sent by VRRP routers. 
    
   Tables in the MIB include the following: 
   (1)  The vrrpOperationsTable, which contains objects that define the 
        operational characteristics of a VRRP router.  Rows in this 
        table correspond to instances of virtual routers. 
   (2)  The vrrpRouterStatisticsTable which contains the operating 
        statistics for a VRRP router. 
   (3)  The vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable, contains the addresses of the 
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up. 
    
8.   VRRP MIB Table Design 
    
   The tables in the VRRP MIB are structured with the assumption that a 
   VRRP network management application would likely be designed to 
   display information or provide configuration about a VRRP router  
   over a IP version "per-virtual-router basis".  Thus, the tables 
   defined in the MIB consist of conceptual rows which are indexed in a 
   manner to present a view of individual virtual routers with a minimal 
   number of SNMP operations. 
    
9.   VRRP Multistack Scenario 
    
   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in 
   this MIB are instantiated. 
    
    
   KEY: 
   ---- 
    
   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the 
   actual MIB objects as follows: 
    
   if      = IfIndex 
   AddrType= vrrpOperationsInetAddrType 
   VrId    = vrrpOperationsVrId 
Tata                                                            [Page 3] 
Internet-Draft              VRRP unified MIB                 April 2006 

   State   = vrrpOperationsState 
   Prior   = vrrpOpeartionsPriority 
   IpAddr  = vrrpOperationsMasterIpAddr 
    
   The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP 
   routers VR1 & VR2, configured with two virtual routers.  Addresses in 
   '()' indicate the address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 
   to H4 are IPv4 hosts and H5 to H8 are IPv6 hosts. A, B and C are IPv4 
   addresses and X, Y and Z are IPv6 addresses. In the diagram, 
   "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB.

   NOTES: 
    
   1)  For "State": M = Master;   B = Backup. 
   2)  In the vrrpOperationsTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that 
       the respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address 
       is native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner").

11.    Security Consideration 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   A number of objects in the vrrpOperationsTable and 
   vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable possess the read-create attribute. 
   Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation 
   of a virtual router. 
    
   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to: 
    
   o The vrrpOperationsRowStatus object which could be used to disable 
   a virtual router. While there are other columns that, if changed,  
   could disrupt operations, they can not be changed without first  
   changing the RowStatus object. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the  
Tata                                                           [Page 38] 
Internet-Draft              VRRP unified MIB                 April 2006 

   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features  
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access 
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   assigning an RFC number after IESG approval.
