1. Introduction 

   In the context of the SPEERMINT working group when two Layer 5 
   devices (e.g., SIP Proxies) peer, there is a need to exchange peering 
   policy information. There are specifications in progress in the 
   SIPPING working group to define policy exchange between an UA and a 
   domain [4] and providing profile data to SIP user agents [6]. This 
   document borrows from both and defines a new SIP Event package and 
   associated semantics to meet the needs of policy exchange between 
   domains.  

   Following the terminology introduced in [4], this package uses the 
   terms Peering Session-Independent and Session-Specific policies in 
   the following context. 

   Peering Session-Independent policies include Diffserv Marking, 
   Policing, Session Admission Control, domain reachabilities, amongst 
   others. The time period between Peering Session-Independent policy 
   changes is much greater than the time it takes to establish a call.  

   Peering Session-Specific polices includes supported connection/call 
   rate, total number of connections/calls available, current 
   utilization, amongst others. Peering Session-specific policies can 
   change within the time it takes to establish a call.

2. Peering Session-Dependent Policies 

   We depict below the detailed peering reference architecture. The 
   Policy Function (PF) is responsible for the exchange of peering 
   policies. 
    
   Peers can exchange policies directly or publish their policies to a 
   central peering policy server. In order to avoid the N^2 problem, the 
   use of a policy server that would be responsible for disseminating 
   the policy information to the appropriate peers is recommended. A 
   similar idea has been in use for many years in layer 3 peering points 
   [8]. 
    
   It is worth mentioning that this policy server does not need to be a 
   separate physical entity, but can reside logically in one of the SIP 
   proxies participating on peering point, acting thus as an aggregator 
   of policies.

2.1. Overall Operation 

   When Layer 5 peering is established between two domains, dynamic 
   policy information need to be exchanged between SIP Proxies in 
   different domains. This information will aid the process of Call 
   routing [7] across domains. 

   Such information includes, but is not limited to, connection/call 
   rate, total number of connections/calls available, current 
   utilization, amongst others.  

   All SIP Proxies engaged in layer 5 peering that want to be notified 
   of dynamic policy information (subscribers) send a SUBSCRIBE request 
   to the policy server specifying the peering-policy event package. 
   Analogously, SIP Proxies that want to disseminate dynamic policy 
   information use the PUBLISH method to propagate such information to 
   the policy server.  

   When new dynamic policy information is available on the policy 
   server, it notifies all subscribers of that specific event package.  

3. Event Package  

   This document defines a new SIP events package according to [2]. The 
   intended methods to use for this event are PUBLISH and 
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY. A SIP Proxy or B2BUA can exchange peering policies 
   using either of these methods.  

4. Use of PUBLISH Method 

   A proxy that supports this specification may send dynamic peering 
   policy information to the policy server using the PUBLISH method.  
   Another peer wishing to receive this peer's peering policy maintains 
   a State Agent for the "peering-policy" event package.

Internet-Draft       Peering Policy Event Package        September 2006 
    

5. Event Package Formal Definition  

5.1. Event Package Name 

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [2]. 
   The name of the event package defined in this specification is 
   "peering-policy". 

5.2. Event Package Parameters 

   TBD: Do we want parameters [6] as well or have everything inside the 
   bodies? 

5.3. SUBSCRIBE Bodies 

   A SUBSCRIBE for the peering-policy package must contain a body that 
   contains the elements of the Peering Policy Dataset Format (PPDS) for 
   which the subscriber is interested in receiving notifications. The 
   notifier will tailor its notifications based on the elements the 
   subscriber is interested.  

5.4. Subscription Duration 

   A subscription to the peering-policy package is usually established 
   when a SIP Proxy first engages in Layer 5 peering. A subscription to 
   the peering-policy package a priori should last as log as the SIP 
   Proxy is engaged in peering.  

   Although the rate of notifications can be high, the interest from the 
   subscriber is to receive notifications as long as the peering 
   relationship is established. Therefore, it is recommended that the 
   default subscription duration for this event package should be set to 
   86400 seconds. 

5.5. NOTIFY Bodies 

   The notification follows the general rules for generating SUBSCRIBE 
   requests defined in [2]. The notification should contain the elements 
   requested by the subscriber. If the data associated to some elements 
   is not available, a special value indicating "not available" should 
   be sent.   

   It is possible that a notification contain more elements than the 
   subscriber requested for the reasons discussed in section 5.8.

Internet-Draft       Peering Policy Event Package        September 2006 
    

5.6. Subscriber generation of SUBSCRIBE requests 

   The subscriber follows the general rules for generating SUBSCRIBE 
   requests defined in [2]. 

5.7. Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE requests 

   The general rules for processing SUBSCRIBE requests [2] apply to this 
   package. More specifically, as each subscription request is received, 
   the notifier maintains a map of subscriptions to associated requested 
   elements. 

5.8. Notifier generation of NOTIFY requests 

   Given all the possible elements each subscriber can request, you can 
   have a scalability problem given the possible number of permutations 
   and rate of notifications. 

   The notifier (policy server) can then send a customized notification 
   for each subscriber if the number is small or a union of the 
   requested elements in order to reduce the number of different 
   notifications. 

5.9. Subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests 

   If a notification contains elements that the subscriber did not 
   request, those elements must be silently discarded. If a notification 
   does not contain any elements that where requested, an error must be 
   generated, and the subscription cancelled and possibly reestablished. 

   The subscriber will use the information received on the notification 
   messages as an input to the call routing process. The subscriber 
   might route call to some other peering point or SIP Proxy, reject 
   calls, bill calls differently, amongst others. 

   The actual actions that the subscriber will take are not in scope of 
   this document. 

5.10. Rate of notifications 

   Since peering session specific policies can change with each 
   established call across the peering interface, the rate of 
   notifications of certain elements could be very high. For this reason 
   the maximum rate of notifications should be one every 5 seconds. 

   Moreover, the actual rate of notifications should be the greater 
   between the value specified in the SUBSCRIBE request and the default.

   TBD: Throttling? 

6. Namespace 

   This specification makes use of XML namespaces [4].  The namespace 
   URIs for schemas defined in this specification are URNs [7], using 
   the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [8] and extended by [5]. 
   The namespace URN for the MPDF schema is: 

         urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:peeringdataset 

      The MIME type for the Media Policy Dataset Format is: 

         application/peering-policy+xml 

7. Elements 

7.1. AdjacencyName 

   This elements names the interconnect relationship. This name is the 
   "subscription key" for the remote party, and represents the key to 
   access the relationship from the remote side.  

7.2. ReferenceTag 

   This element is a unique tag assigned to identify this data object 
   for all subsequent updates/replacements/deletions. 

7.3. Hostname 

   This is the FQDN of the proxy address to use. This may not match the 
   address of the server providing this data. For example, this data may 
   be supplied by a centralized policy server, or a centralized proxy 
   referring to a farm of proxy servers. This element can also be 
   updated to move services to another proxy in real time. 

7.4. ServiceState 

   This is either "in service", "no new calls", "out of service". The 
   service state can be changed at any time. Transitioning to "in 
   service" will indicate that calls can be sent immediately. 
   Transitioning to "no new calls" will permit existing calls to 
   continue. Transitioning to "out of service" will indicate that all 
   calls should be dropped.

7.5. Protocol 

   SIP is the only answer here for now. [Optional - this may not be 
   needed] 

7.6. Version  

   Currently rfc3261 or rfc2543 are the only answers. This will indicate 
   if the proxy supports strict or loose routing. [Optional - this may 
   not be needed] 

7.7. TransportMethod 

   This can be rfc3161 (UDP/TCP/TLS based on protocol/port/packet size), 
   UDP Only (Fragment Packets larger than 1368 bytes), Dynamic TCP, 
   Static TCP, SCTP. [optional - this may only be required when 
   exceptional (non 3261) behavior is expected - such as fragmenting UDP 
   packets] 

7.8. Vlan 

   Vlan tag to use on all packets to be sent to his proxy. This may be 
   specified for security reasons or L2 switching reasons. A vlan tag of 
   0 means no tagging is performed. 

7.9. MaxChannels 

   Maximum total count of dialogues that this proxy can support. 

7.10. MaxOutboundChannels 

   Maximum total count of outbound dialogues. This used in combination 
   with the MaxChannels can control the ratio of inbound to outbound. 
   This ratio is important for some bidirectional interconnects that may 
   have service guarantees.  

7.11. MaxBurstRate 

   Maximum call setup rate within the BurstWindow 

7.12. BurstRateWindow 

   Number of seconds to use for determining MaxBurstRate 

7.13. MaxSustainedRate 

   Maximum sustained call rate within the SustainedRateWindow

Internet-Draft       Peering Policy Event Package        September 2006 
    

7.14. SustainedRateWindow 

   Number of seconds to use for determining MaxSustainedRate 

7.15. TimeToResume 

   When a constraint is reached (Burst/Sustained/Max Channels), how long 
   to pause before attempting to use this proxy again. 

7.16. NoResponseTimer 

   How long for a proxy to be unresponsive before it is automatically 
   taken out of service. 

7.17. InServiceTimer 

   How long the proxy should be responsive after an out of service 
   condition (keepalive failure/no response timer exceeded) before new 
   calls should be attempted. 

7.18. KeepAliveMethod 

   Defines the method for performing keep alive. This includes 'stun', 
   'ping', 'crlf'. 

7.19. KeepAliveInterval 

   Defines the interval between keep-alives. 

8. Example 

   Since the originating peer proxy does not know if the destination AOR 
   is a PF or a SF, it must progress with a normal dialog request with 
   the assumption it is a SF.  In the event a request fails due to an 
   authentication failure (401 Unauthorized), and no known 
   authentication credentials exist or no longer appear to be working, 
   the requesting proxy may issue a SUBSCRIBE request to the attempted 
   peer's AOR received through the discovery phase.  The SUBSCRIBE 
   request should be a request to attain a, currently, undefined peering 
   policy event package.  In some cases, the requesting proxy already 
   knows it must attain the peering policy event package, and may forego 
   the initial INVITE attempt and issue a SUBSCRIBE request instead.  
   Once this phase is completed, after extracting and following any 
   specific received policies, the authentication phase is attempted as 
   the policy permits or requires.  The following message flow provides 
   an example of the policy exchange phase.

9. Security Considerations 

   To prevent these attacks, a subscriber using this event package 
   SHOULD authenticate the notifier (i.e. the policy server) before 
   disclosing session information or accepting a session policy.  This 
   requires the subscriber to perform server authentication which can be 
   done, for example, via TLS or another transport mechanism.   

   Similarly, notifiers SHOULD authenticate subscribers using any of the 
   techniques available through SIP, including digest, S/MIME, TLS or 
   other transport specific mechanisms.   

    

10. IANA Considerations 

10.1. Event Package Name 

   This specification registers an event package, based on the 
   registration procedures defined in RFC 3265 [2].  The following is 
   the information required for such a registration: 

   Package Name: peering-policy 

   Package or Template-Package: This is a package.
