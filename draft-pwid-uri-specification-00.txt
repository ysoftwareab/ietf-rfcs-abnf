                 Scheme Specification for the pwid URI
                    draft-pwid-uri-specification-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for
   Persistent Web IDentifiers to web archives using the 'pwid' scheme
   name.  The purpose of the standard is to support general, global,
   sustainable, humanly readable and technology agnostic persistent web
   references that are not sufficiently covered by existing web
   reference practices.  Since only archived web can reach a degree of
   persistency.  The 'pwid' URI primarily aim at references into web
   archives.

1.  Introduction

   The motivation for defining a pwid URI scheme is the growing
   challenge of references to web resources, which are poorly supported
   in citation guidelines.  Citation guidelines generally don't cover
   general and persistent referencing techniques for web resources that
   are not registered by Persistent Identifier systems (like DOI [DOI]).
   However, an increasing number of references point to resources that
   only exist on the web.  Such web referencing is highly relevant and
   crucial for various research fields.  For example blogs that shows
   out to have a historical impact.

   Today there are different ways to refer to web references that are
   not registered:

   o  By specifying http/https address and the date it was visited

   o  Via Citation services - which constructs citation http/https
      addresses that are not following a general scheme and that will
      change or be lost in case the citation service change domain,
      service

   o  Via Web Archive http/https access addresses - which can only be
      used for open web archives.  Furthermore, Web archive http/https

Internet-Draft    Scheme Specification for the pwid URI    December 2016


      addresses are not following a general scheme, and they will change
      or be lost in case the web archive service changes domain, or
      changes path to the web archive service

   Http/https address and date is in no way persistent, and is the main
   reason for studies showing that a large percentage of links in
   research studies are dead after a relatively short period.  Citation
   services can sometimes be used, but responsibility of preservation
   and collection is not fully clear, and they often use http/https
   address shorteners for access, which complicates preservation of
   source and metadata even more.

   Finally, there are the web archives that offer access openly or
   locally, but where access http/https addresses depends on domains for
   the web archive as well as differing paths to their access service.

   The 'pwid' URI Scheme is another step in facilitating, supporting,
   and standardizing the problem of persistent web references to
   resources in web archives.  Accessing a referenced web resource will
   require APIs from web archives no matter whether they are open web
   archive or not.  There are different solutions for the resolving of a
   'pwid' URI, which needs to be investigated and implemented as use and
   support of the 'pwid' URI evolves.

   According to RFC 3986 [RFC3986]], a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   is "a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or
   physical resource".  The 'pwid' URI Scheme defined in this document
   identifies web archive resources (abstract resources) in a general,
   global, stainable, humanly readable and technology agnostic way.  An
   example of such a 'pwid' URI follows:

      pwid:archive.org:2016-01-22T11.20.29Z_page:http://www.dr.dk

   In this example the domain of the archive has been used as
   identifier.  However, an archive identifier does NOT need to be a
   domain.  The choice in the example is only to use a short archive
   identifier that is already associated with the archive.

   For the sake of usability and sustainability, the definition of the
   'pwid' URI scheme is focused on only having the minimum required
   information in order to precisely identify a resource in an arbitrary
   web archive.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Demonstrable, New, Long-Lived Utility

   The 'pwid' URI scheme allows identification of web archive resources
   in a general, global, sustainable, humanly readable and technology
   agnostic way.  No matter whether it will become resolvable, it can be
   used at any time to identify the web archive resource, as long as the
   material exists.

   The 'pwid' is defined as a URI as there are great potentials for
   making it resolvable.  This means it could function as a URN RFC 2141
   [RFC2141], but is not defined as such as the ambition is to make it
   resolvable.  At the same time the 'pwid' definition can enjoy the
   same common syntactic, semantic, and shared language benefits that
   the URI presentation confers.

   The interest for this new 'pwid' URI scheme has already been shown, a
   long paper about the invention of the 'pwid' URI "Persistent Web
   References - Best Practices and New Suggestions" [IPRES] was accepted
   for the iPres 2016 conference and nominated as best paper.

   There is no question about the need for a standard to address web
   materials meeting precision and persistency issues on par precision
   in with traditional references for analogue material.  The interest
   for the 'pwid' URI indicates that this is a recognized issue, and
   that the 'pwid' URI can fill a gap.

   The 'pwid' URI will benefit from becoming resolvable to some extent,
   but as a start it has a value even without being resolvable.

3.  Syntactic Compatibility

   The syntax of the 'pwid' URI Scheme is specified below in Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) RFC 5234 [RFC5234] and it conforms to URI
   syntax defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The syntax definition of the
   'pwid' URI is:

     pwid-uri  = pwid-scheme ":" pwid-spec
     pwid-spec = archive-id ":" archived-date [ content-spec ]
                 ":" archived-item

   where

     pwid-scheme = "pwid"
     archive-id  = +( unreserved )

     archived-date   = full-date datetime-delim full-pwid-time
     datetime-delim  = "_" / "T"

Internet-Draft    Scheme Specification for the pwid URI    December 2016


     full-pwid-time  = time-hour ["."] time-minute ["."] time-second "Z"
     content-spec    = "_page" / "_part" / "_coll" / "_snapshot"
                       / "_rec" / "_other"

     archived-item = URI / archived-item-id
     archived-item-id  = +( unreserved )

   where

   o  'unreserved' is defined as in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

   o  'content-spec' values are not case sensitive (i.e. "_PAGE" /
      "_PART" / "_PaGe" / ... are valid values as well.)

   o  'archived-date' is a UTC timestamp conforming to the W3C profile
      ISO8601 also defined in RFC 3339 [RFC3339], with a few exception
      for the datetime-delim and full-pwid-time, and "." is used instead
      of ":" in order not to collide with ":" used for delimitation of
      URI parts.  This means that full-date is defined as in RFC 3339
      [RFC3339].
      The datetime-delim "_" is accepted in order to make it more
      readable, in the same way as the W3C profile accepts " ", but
      where "_" is used here in order to use allowed URI characters in
      an URI.  In line with RFC 3339 [RFC3339] the "T" may alternatively
      be lower case "t".
      time-hour, time-minute and time-second is defined as in RFC 3339
      [RFC3339].
      In line with RFC 3339 [RFC3339] the "Z" may alternatively be lower
      case "z".

   o  'URI' is defined as in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

   Note that the 'content-spec' is a parameter that could have been
   specified as a query.  However, since the 'pwid-uri' can include an
   URI as 'archived-item', it would introduce ambiguities if the
   'content-spec' was specified as a query, since it would not be clear
   whether the query belonged to the 'pwid-uri' or the 'archived-item'.

   The 'content-spec' defines the type of archived item.  This serves as
   a precision to what is referred:

   o  when a URI is specified, since it can be what was harvested for
      the specific URI, or it can be the URI interpreted as a web page
      within the context of the specified archive

   o  it can specify the type of contents expected for an identifier
      ('archived-item-id'), which can be a collection a snapshot, a
      recording or other identifier

4.  Well Defined

   The information in a 'pwid' URI can be used for locating a web
   archive resource, for any kind of web archive.  It includes the
   minimum information for web archive materials which enables
   resolvability, manually or by a resolver.  One of the reasons for
   defining 'pwid' as a URI is to open the possibility to make a
   generally resolvable representation.

   The information needed is:

   o  Web archive identification
      to find the archive holding the material

   o  Archived URI or identifier of item
      as part of identifying the material

   o  Date and time associated with the archived URI/item
      as part of precise identification of the material

   o  Specification of what is referred
      as part of clarification of what is referred

   For example the 'pwid' URI:

      pwid:archive.org:2016-01-22T11.20.29Z_page:http://www.dr.dk

   has the information:

   o  archive.org
      current known identifier of Internet Archives open access web
      archive

   o  2016-01-22T11.20.29Z
      Date and time associated with the archived URI

   o  page
      Clarification that it is the web page that is being referred

   o  http://www.dr.dk
      Archived URI of item

   With knowledge of the current (2016) Internet Archive open access web
   interface having the form:

      https://web.archive.org/web/<digit date>/<uri>

Internet-Draft    Scheme Specification for the pwid URI    December 2016


   We can manually (or technically) deduce an actual (current 2016)
   access https address:

      https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/http://www.dr.dk

   and regard the referred web page as the reference.

   The same recipe can be used for other Wayback platforms - and
   possibly also other web archive access tools platforms, as the
   crucial information is date and URI which are requested to be looked
   up in a specified archive.

   Note that this also includes access to archives that are only
   accessible via a local proxy to a restricted environment.  Here the
   difference is that the archive information is used to identify the
   local environment used (possibly on-site) and then construct local
   http/https address based on knowledge from the local access
   installation.

5.  Definition of Operations

   There is not a specific definition of computational operation yet,
   but there will be ongoing work to see if it can be put into operation
   in different ways.

   There may be a need for varied operation depending on whether a web
   archive is open online, or whether it is a closed archive that only
   works in a restricted environment.

   At this stage there are initiatives on streamlined APIs to web
   archives, - and in case such an API will be implemented generally, it
   may be used for resolving of the 'pwid' URIs.

   Because of the case of closed archives, the 'pwid' URI resolving can
   in such cases be a question of starting a special application, as for
   the 'mailto' scheme RFC 6068 [RFC6068].

   For open archives resolving could be a matter of creating an http/
   https address based on knowledge of the archive and access interfaces
   to the archive.  In the latter case this would require:

   1.  An archive registry
       as a start the current archive domains could be used, but as soon
       as domains are changed the validity of a 'pwid' URI will be
       dependent on such a registry.

   2.  Open access http/https address pattern registry




Zierau                    Expires June 11, 2017                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Scheme Specification for the pwid URI    December 2016


       this would only make sense for the open web archives, and it does
       not need to be a formal registry, since the pattern can be found
       (manually) as long as the archive is identifiable.  Thus the
       validity of a 'pwid' URI does not depend on such a registry.

   In all cases the 'pwid' URI can be used for 'manual' look up as
   described in the previous section.

6.  Context of Use

   Typically, 'pwid' URIs will be used for references to web resources
   in web archives, e.g. in research or scholarly work.  However, it may
   also be used for research data management specification (specifying
   specific target of archived contents from an http/https address) or
   applications that are restricted to access a specific set of archived
   contents from http/https addresses in a web archive.  When the
   references are listed in hypertext documents, these will become
   resolvable in case the pwid URI becomes resolvable.

   As described above, there may come different implementations for
   resolving which may rely on different protocols and application; -
   from redirects to the http/https protocol to call of locally
   installed browser plug-ins or applications.

7.  Internationalization and Character Encoding

   Internationalization and character encoding for 'pwid' URIs are
   relevant for the webarchive-id and archived-uri parts of the scheme-
   specific-part of the 'pwid' URI, since both archived-date and
   content-spec only can be constructed by a very limited set of
   characters.

   The webarchive-id will not be case sensitive, but can allow for
   percent encodings, although for simplicity reasons, it may turn out
   that the coming establishment of an archiving registry will recommend
   using letters that do not need encodings.

   The archived-uri follows the rules of URIs in general (currently for
   http and https URIs archived in web archives).  The archived-uri is
   only case sensitive to the extent that the web archive can handle
   archived case sensitive URIs.

8.  Scheme Name Considerations

   The scheme name is "pwid" - short for Persistent Web Identifier.
   Initially the scheme name "wpid" was reserved.  However, one of the
   feedbacks has been a concern that "wpid" was interpreted as a PID
   related to a PID-system, e.g. as the DOI.  All though PID does not



Zierau                    Expires June 11, 2017                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Scheme Specification for the pwid URI    December 2016


   have a precise definition that makes it wrong to call it a "wpid",
   the danger is that it is confused with PID systems which is not the
   intension.  Consequently, this suggestion names the scheme "pwid"
   instead.

9.  Interoperability Considerations

   This is covered by comments on the date in the section of Syntactic
   Compatibility, where the archived-date conforms to the W3C profile
   ISO8601, except for minor modification in order to make it fit into a
   URI.  Furthermore, the archived-uri conforms to the URI standard.

10.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to all that have contributed to this work in creating the
   iPres paper, commenting at the iPres conference and reviewing this
   RFC

11.  IANA Considerations

   The pwid URI scheme is reserved as a provisional URI as result of
   request IANA #938449

12.  Clear Security and Privacy Considerations

   Security and privacy considerations are restricted to accessible web
   resources in web archives.  If resolvers to 'pwid' URIs are created,
   there should be made an analysis of whether they can be restricted to
   the former mentioned registry of web archives.  Security and privacy
   will then be a question of security and privacy considerations
   related to the web archive resources.
