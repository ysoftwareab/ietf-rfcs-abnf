                           OSPF Link Overload
                    draft-ietf-ospf-link-overload-02

Abstract

   When a link is being prepared to be taken out of service, the traffic
   needs to be diverted from both ends of the link.  Increasing the
   metric to the highest metric on one side of the link is not
   sufficient to divert the traffic flowing in the other direction.

   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to be
   able to advertise a link being in an overload state to indicate
   impending maintenance activity on the link.  This information can be
   used by the network devices to re-route the traffic effectively.

   This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate link
   overload information in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

Internet-Draft             OSPF link overload                  July 2016


1.  Introduction

   When a node is being prepared for a planned maintenance or upgrade,
   [RFC6987] provides mechanisms to advertise the node being in an
   overload state by setting all outgoing link costs to MAX-METRIC
   (0xffff).  These procedures are specific to the maintenance activity
   on a node and cannot be used when a single link attached to the node
   requires maintenance.

   In traffic-engineering deployments, LSPs need to be moved away from
   the link without disrupting the services.  It is useful to be able to
   advertise the impending maintenance activity on the link and to have
   LSP re-routing policies at the ingress to route the LSPs away from
   the link.

   Many OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 deployments run on overlay networks provisioned
   by means of pseudo-wires or L2-circuits.  When the devices in the
   underlying network go for maintenance, it is useful to divert the
   traffic away from the node before the maintenance is actually
   scheduled.  Since the nodes in the underlying network are not visible
   to OSPF, the existing stub router mechanism described in [RFC6987]
   cannot be used.  Application specific to this use case is described
   in Section 7.1

   This document provides mechanisms to advertise link overload state in
   the flexible encodings provided by RI LSA( [RFC7770]) for OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.  Throughout this document, OSPF is used when the text applies
   to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 is used when the text is
   specific to one version of the OSPF protocol.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation of this document is to reduce manual intervention
   during maintenance activities.  The following objectives help to
   accomplish this in a range of deployment scenarios.

   1.  Advertise impending maintenance activity so that the traffic from
       both directions can be diverted away from the link.

   2.  Allow the solution to be backward compatible so that nodes that
       do not understand the new advertisement do not cause routing
       loops.

   3.  Advertise the maintenance activity to other nodes in the network
       so that LSP ingress routers/controllers can learn the impending
       maintenance activity and apply specific policies to re-route the
       LSP for traffic-engineering based deployments.

   4.  Allow the link to be used as last resort link to prevent traffic
       disruption when alternate paths are not available.

3.  Link overload sub-TLV

3.1.  OSPF Link overload sub-TLV

   The Link Overload sub-TLV is defined as below.  This sub-TLV is
   attached to the Link TLV [RFC3630] and carried in RI LSA [RFC7770]
   for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3

4.  Flooding Scope

   The link overload information can be flood in area scoped RI LSA or
   link scoped RI LSA or both based on the need of the application.
   Section 7 describes applications requiring area scope as well as link
   scope Link-overload information.  The Link TLV and the link-overload
   sub-tlv MAY appear in any instance of the RI-LSA.

4.1.  Area scope flooding

   For OSPFv2, Link overload Sub-TLV is carried in the Link TLV as
   defined in [RFC3630].  Link TLV is carried in area scoped RI LSA
   [RFC7770].  When there are more than one parallel links between two
   nodes, the link carrying link-overload information, need to be
   uniquely identified among the parallel links.  Remote interface IP
   address sub-tlv as defined by [RFC3630] is also carried in the Link
   TLV which is used by the remote nodes to uniquely identify the
   overloaded link.

Internet-Draft             OSPF link overload                  July 2016


   For OSPFv3, Link-overload sub-tlv is carried in Link TLV as defined
   in [RFC5329] Link TLV is carried in the OSPFv3 area scoped RI-LSA
   [RFC7770]

4.2.  Link scope flooding

   The link local scope RI-LSA corresponds to the link on which the LSA
   arrives and there is no need to explicitly carry the link TLV.  The
   Link overload sub-TLV is carried in the RI-LSA for both OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.

5.  Elements of procedure

   The Link Overload sub-TLV indicates that the link identified in which
   it is carried is overloaded.  The node that has the link to be taken
   out of service SHOULD originate the Link Overload sub-TLV in the Link
   TLV in the RI LSA as defined in [RFC7770].  The link-overload
   information is carried as a property of the link and is flooded
   across the area.  This information can be used by ingress routers or
   controllers to take special actions.  Application specific to this
   use case is described in Section 7.2.

   The precise action taken by the remote node at the other end of the
   link identified as overloaded depends on the link type.

5.1.  Point-to-point links

   The node that has the link to be taken out of service SHOULD set
   metric of the link to MAX-METRIC (0xffff) and re- originate the
   Router-LSA.  The TE metric SHOULD be set to MAX-TE-METRIC-1
   (0xfffffffe) and the node SHOULD re-originate the TE Link Opaque
   LSAs.  When a Link Overload sub-TLV is received for a point-to-point
   link either by link local or area scoped RI-LSA, the remote node
   SHOULD identify the local link which corresponds to the overloaded
   link and set the metric to MAX-METRIC (0xffff).  The remote node MUST
   re-originate the router-LSA with the changed metric and flood into
   the OSPF area.  The TE metric SHOULD be set to MAX-TE-METRIC-1
   (0xfffffffe) and the TE opaque LSA for the link MUST be re-originated
   with new value.

   In multi-topology deployments [RFC4915], the Link overload Sub-TLV
   carried in an RI LSA corresponds to all the topologies the link
   belongs to.  The receiver node SHOULD change the metric in the
   reverse direction corresponding to all the topologies to which the
   reverse link belongs.

   When the originator of the Link Overload sub-TLV purges the RI-LSA or
   re-originates it without the Link Overload sub-TLV, the remote node

Internet-Draft             OSPF link overload                  July 2016


   must re-originate the appropriate LSAs with the metric and TE metric
   values set to their original values.

5.2.  Broadcast/NBMA links

   Broadcast or NBMA networks in OSPF are represented by a star topology
   where the Designated Router (DR) is the central point to which all
   other routers on the broadcast or NBMA network connect logically.  As
   a result, routers on the broadcast or NBMA network advertise only
   their adjacency to the DR.  Routers that do not act as DR do not form
   or advertise adjacencies with each other.  For the Broadcast links,
   the MAX-METRIC on the remote link cannot be changed since all the
   neighbours are on same link.  Setting the link cost to MAX-METRIC
   would impact paths going via all neighbours.

   The node that has the link to be taken out of service SHOULD set
   metric of the link to MAX-METRIC (0xffff) and re-originate the
   Router-LSA.  The TE metric SHOULD be set to MAX-TE-METRIC-
   1(0xfffffffe) and the node SHOULD re-originate the TE Link Opaque
   LSAs.  For a broadcast link, the two part metric as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-two-part-metric] is used.  The node originating the
   Link Overload sub-TLV MUST set the metric in the Network-to-Router
   Metric sub-TLV to MAX-METRIC 0xffff for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 and re-
   originate the LSAs the TLV is carried-in.

   The nodes that receive the two part metric should follow the
   procedures described in [I-D.ietf-ospf-two-part-metric].  The
   backward compatibility procedures described in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-two-part-metric] should be followed to ensure loop
   free routing.

5.3.  Point-to-multipoint links

   Operation for the point-to-multipoint links is similar to the point-
   to-point links.  When a Link Overload sub-TLV is received for a
   point-to-multipoint link the remote node SHOULD identify the link
   which corresponds to the overloaded link and set the metric to MAX-
   METRIC (0xffff).  The remote node MUST re-originate the Router-LSA
   with the changed metric and flood into the OSPF area.

5.4.  Unnumbered interfaces

   Unnumbered interface do not have a unique IP addresses and borrow
   address from other interfaces.  The Link TLV carries the local and
   remote interface ids to uniquely identify the link when there are
   more than one parallel links between the nodes.  Procedures to obtain
   interface-id of the remote side is defined in [RFC4203] and are

   applicable to the Link TLV added in the RI LSA for the purpose of
   carrying the Link overload sub-tlv.

6.  Backward compatibility

   The mechanism described in the document is fully backward
   compatible.It is required that the originator of the Link Overload
   sub-TLV as well as the node at the remote end of the link identified
   as overloaded understand the extensions defined in this document.  In
   the case of broadcast links, the backward compatibility procedures as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ospf-two-part-metric] are applicable.  .

                    Private VLAN


                       Figure 2: Pseudowire Services

   Many service providers offer pseudo-wire services to customers using
   L2 circuits.  The IGP protocol that runs in the customer network
   would also run over the pseudo-wire to create seamless private
   network for the customer.  Service providers want to offer overload
   kind of functionality when the PE device is taken-out for
   maintenance.  The provider should guarantee that the PE is taken out
   for maintenance only after the service is successfully diverted on an
   alternate path.  There can be large number of customers attached to a
   PE node and the remote end-points for these pseudo-wires are spread
   across the service provider's network.  It is a tedious and error-
   prone process to change the metric for all pseudo-wires in both
   directions.The link overload feature simplifies the process by
   increasing the metric on the link in the reverse direction as well so
   that traffic in both directions is diverted away from the PE
   undergoing maintenance.  The link-overload feature allows the link to
   be used as a last resort link so that traffic is not disrupted when
   alternative paths are not available.

                         Alternate Path


              Figure 3: Controller based Traffic Engineering

   In controller-based deployments where the controller participates in
   the IGP protocol, the controller can also receive the link-overload
   information as a warning that link maintenance is imminent.  Using
   this information, the controller can find alternate paths for traffic
   which use the affected link.  The controller can apply various
   policies and re-route the LSPs away from the link undergoing
   maintenance.  If there are no alternate paths satisfying the traffic
   engineering constraints, the controller might temporarily relax those
   constraints and put the service on a different path.

   In the above example, PE1->PE2 LSP is set-up which satisfies a
   constraint of 10 GB bandwidth on each link.The links P1->P3 and
   P3->P2 have only 1 GB capacity.  and there is no alternate path
   satisfying the bandwidth constraint of 10GB.  When P1->P2 link is
   being prepared for maintenance, the controller receives the link-
   overload information, as there is no alternate path available which
   satisfies the constraints, controller chooses a path that is less
   optimal and sets up an alternate path via P1->P3->P2 temporarily.
   Once the traffic is diverted, P1->P2 link can be taken out for
   maintenance/upgrade.
