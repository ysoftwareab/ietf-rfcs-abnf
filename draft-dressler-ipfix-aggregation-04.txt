Abstract

   IPFIX Flow Aggregation describes a methodology for reducing the
   amount of measurement data exchanged between monitoring devices
   (IPFIX Exporters) and analyzers (IPFIX Collectors).  Aggregation
   techniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope with

   increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever-
   growing network capacities.  Using aggregation techniques,
   measurement information of multiple Flows that are sharing some
   common criteria is merged to be exported in one Compound Flow.
   Subsets of Flows eligible for aggregation, as well as the desired
   degree of similarity, can be customized using a set of Aggregation
   Rules.

1.  Introduction

   Flow measurement in high-speed large-scale networks easily produces
   an amount of data that can no longer be handled by a single IPFIX
   Collector.  Also, many applications processing Flow measurement data
   do not require detailed Flow-level information, but require only
   generic Flow information, with the scope of this information being
   very application-specific.  Examples for applications benefiting of
   IPFIX Flow aggregation are charging and intrusion detection.  In the
   former application, detailed information about individual Flows is
   not required.  Similarly, intrusion detection applications may be
   satisfied with Flow information for specific subnets.  Flow
   aggregation is also a viable solution for the anonymization of Flow
   information.

   This document presents a flexible Flow aggregation scheme that helps
   reduce the number and the size of exported Flow Records, as well as
   helps adapt the transmitted measurement information to the
   requirements of deployed applications.  Measurement data reduction is
   achieved by discarding unneeded measurement information and merging
   multiple individual Flows into a smaller number of Compound Flows,
   which are then exported to the analyzer.

   Flow aggregation can take place either directly in IPFIX-enabled
   devices or externally, in an IPFIX concentrator.  Monitoring networks
   can thus be deployed in a logical tree topology, using multiple
   levels of intermediate concentrators, rather than in a logical star
   topology, i.e. with each exporter connecting to a central analyzer.

   The following sections illustrate the design and implementation of
   Flow aggregation.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   Apart from the basic terms described in [RFC3917],
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], and [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture], the
   following terms are used within this document:

   Compound Flow:
      A Compound Flow is the result of an aggregation of one or more
      individual input Flows that matched an Aggregation Rule.  It
      might, for example, contain the total count of all packets
      addressed to a common subnet that were observed within a given
      time interval.

Internet-Draft           IPFIX Flow Aggregation            November 2007


   Aggregation Rule:
      An Aggregation Rule defines the properties of a Compound Flow and
      the contents of the corresponding Flow Records.  Optionally, a set
      of selection criteria MAY be specified in order to restrict the
      applicability of the Aggregation Rule to those Flows that show
      certain patterns.

   Preceding Rule:
      The Preceding Rule represents a mechanism to inform the collector
      about the position of the matching Aggregation Rule in the entire
      chain or tree of Aggregation Rules.  This parameter MAY be used to
      dynamically transmit parts of the rule chain or tree.


3.  Architecture

   Aggregation of measurement data may take place at two possible
   stages:

   An internal aggregator is implemented as part of a metering process
   running in an IPFIX-enabled device.  The aggregated Flow data is
   exported in form of Compound Flows.

   An IPFIX concentrator, as introduced in [RFC3917], may be used if the
   deployed monitoring devices cannot be modified to incorporate an
   internal aggregator and, hence, an external aggregator needs to be
   deployed.  Additionally, a concentrator MAY be employed to save
   processing resources of distributed monitoring devices.  Furthermore,
   concentrators enable cascaded, multi-level aggregation of Flow
   information.


4.  Aggregation

   In order to efficiently customize both the contents and the size of
   exported Compound Flows, a two-step approach is proposed.

   1.  Incoming Flows are selected by comparing contained information
       with configured selection criteria, enabling the aggregator to
       discard unwanted Flows.

   2.  The selected Flows are aggregated by discarding fields or parts
       of fields, enabling the aggregator to create Compound Flows by
       merging Flows according to a reduced Flow Key.

   For the configuration of the selection and aggregation processes, a
   rule-based approach is proposed, where each aggregator is supplied a
   list of user-defined Aggregation Rules.

4.1.  Aggregation Rule

   An Aggregation Rule (see Section 5 for an example) consists of
   multiple instructions, one for each data field that is to be
   considered.  Each of the Aggregation Rules' instructions comprises
   the following elements:

   o  The data field the instruction refers to (e.g.
      destinationIPv4Address).  Only Flows that contain the field
      mentioned will be eligible for aggregation according to this
      Aggregation Rule.

   o  An optional selection pattern (e.g. 192.0.2.0/24) for this field
      that further restricts eligibility of incoming Flows to those that
      match the given value(s).  Only Flows that match all patterns of
      the Aggregation Rule will be aggregated.  Selection is explained
      in more detail in Section 4.3

   o  A field modifier (e.g. mask to 28 bits) that either configures how
      much information in this field should be retained unmodified by
      the aggregator or that the field's values should be aggregated
      instead.  Compound Flow creation is explained in more detail in
      Section 4.4.

   Fields that do not appear in any of an Aggregation Rule's
   instructions are not part of its associated Compound Flow Records.
   Incoming Flows that are not covered by any Aggregation Rule are
   discarded.

4.2.  Multiple Aggregation Rules

   By default, incoming Flow Records are checked against all of the
   configured Aggregation Rules.  If an Aggregation Rule matches, i.e.
   if the Flow Record comprises all required fields and matches all
   given patterns, the field modifiers are applied and corresponding
   Compound Flow Records generated or updated.  Therefore, incoming Flow
   Records that match multiple Aggregation Rules contribute to multiple
   Compound Flows.

   In some cases, it is preferred that an incoming Flow Record that
   matched a certain Aggregation Rule is not checked against further
   Aggregation Rules in order to avoid that this Flow contributes to
   multiple Compound Flows.  Therefore, it is possible to indicate a
   Preceding Rule for each Aggregation Rule.  If a Preceding Rule is set
   for an Aggregation Rule, an aggregator first tries to aggregate an
   incoming Flow according to the Preceding Rule.  Only if the Preceding
   Rule is not applicable, e.g. because the incoming Flow does not match
   the given pattern, the current Aggregation Rule is applied.  Using



Dressler, et al.  draft-dressler-ipfix-aggregation-04.txt       [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           IPFIX Flow Aggregation            November 2007


   the Preceding Rule relationship, Aggregation Rules can thus be
   organized in rule chains and rule trees where only the first matching
   Aggregation Rule is applied in every chain or branch.  Consequently,
   each incoming Flow Record is aggregated at most once per chain or
   tree.  Rules that do not define a Preceding Rule constitute the
   beginning of a rule chain or the root of a rule tree and are used to
   check all incoming Flow Records.

   If a Preceding Rule is set for an Aggregation Rule, a suitable
   mechanism SHOULD be employed by an aggregator to communicate to
   receivers of a Compound Flow not only its common inclusion criteria,
   i.e. having matched the Aggregation Rule's selection patterns, but
   also its common exclusion criteria, i.e. not having matched any
   Preceding Rule's selection patterns.  IPFIX extensions that enable
   efficient transport of such information are introduced in
   [I-D.sommer-ipfix-mediator-ext].

4.3.  Selection

   As introduced in Section 4.1, the applicability of an Aggregation
   Rule MAY be restricted to Flows that match certain patterns.  Thus,
   patterns act as criteria that enable the selection of Flows eligible
   for aggregation and subsequent export to the analyzer.  For example,
   the pattern "80" can configured for the sourceTransportPort field in
   order to export only Compound Flows sent by an HTTP server.

   Selecting Flows means that all of the source Flows that make up a
   certain Compound Flow will share a specific set of field values (e.g.
   destination address 192.0.2.1 and destination port 80).  This common
   set of field values MUST be transmitted to receivers along with
   Compound Flows' specific field values, so as not to lose information.

   In order to conserve traffic volume it SHOULD, however, not be
   directly included in all exported Compound Flow Records, but rather
   communicated by more bandwidth-conserving means which still guarantee
   a stable association from specific properties to Common Properties of
   a Flow.

   One such means is the transmission as a set of Common Properties.
   This method is outlined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-reducing-redundancy] and
   illustrated in Figure 1.  In order to unambiguously communicate to
   receivers which Common Properties of a Flow stem from aggregation,
   when multiple Common Properties are transmitted in one Flow, an
   aggregator SHOULD make sure that the first commonPropertiesID
   transmitted in Flows directly corresponds to the set of selection
   criteria used.

   Extensions to the IPFIX protocol and the IPFIX information model,

   which allow for a much more compact data format, are introduced in
   [I-D.sommer-ipfix-mediator-ext].

4.4.  Compound Flow Creation

   As introduced in Section 4.1, a different field modifier can be
   assigned to each field of an Aggregation Rule.  The following types
   of field modifiers can be used:

   discard:
      The field is not included in Compound Flow Records, i.e.  Compound
      Flows are not distinguishable with respect to this field.
      Incoming Flows with different values for this field can be merged
      and thus contribute to the same Compound Flow.

   keep:
      The field is included unmodified in Compound Flow Records, i.e.
      Compound Flows are distinguishable with respect to this field.
      Incoming Flows with different values for this field are not
      merged, but contribute to different Compound Flows instead.

   mask to n bits:
      The field is included in Compound Flow Records, but the number of
      significant bits is reduced (applicable to IP addresses only).
      Incoming Flows with IP addresses belonging to the same subnet are
      merged, so Compound Flows are distinguishable with respect to
      resulting subnet addresses only.  In accordance with
      [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info], the resulting subnet address MAY be encoded



Dressler, et al.  draft-dressler-ipfix-aggregation-04.txt       [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IPFIX Flow Aggregation            November 2007


      with an IP prefix field and an IP mask field.  For performance
      reasons it SHOULD, however, be encoded with a single field of the
      abstract data type ipv4Network introduced in
      [I-D.sommer-ipfix-mediator-ext].

   aggregate:
      The field is included in Compound Flow Records, but field values
      derived from multiple incoming Flows' values.

   The value of fields with a field modifier of "aggregate" is computed
   from the corresponding values of the original Flows by taking the
   most appropriate of the following actions (listed in ascending order
   of priority):

   1.  As also specified in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] the value of variable
       fields, which may change from packet to packet within a single
       Flow, is determined by the first packet observed for the
       corresponding Compound Flow.  As a consequence, if no other
       action is more appropriate, the default behavior requires using
       the value of the incoming Flow Record with the earliest start
       timestamp.

   2.  For some Information Elements, [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] explicitly
       specifies a different semantic, which is to then take precedence
       over the aforementioned default behavior.

   3.  For some Information Elements, Table 1 specifies an aggregation
       function that has to be used in order to obtain a correct,
       aggregated value.  If such an aggregation function is listed, it
       takes precedence over all other available functions.  For
       example, the start timestamp of the Compound Flow is always set
       to the minimum of the original start timestamps, while packet and
       octet counts of aggregated Flows are always summed up.

4.5.  Deriving Templates from Aggregation Rules

   With the definition of an Aggregation Rule as being comprised of one
   instruction per Compound Flow field, each Aggregation Rule
   unambiguously defines the structure of these Compound Flows.  As
   illustrated in Table 2, all selection patterns of an Aggregation Rule
   become Common Properties of associated Compound Flows.  With the
   exception of fields that are discarded, all fields of an Aggregation
   Rule transmit specific properties of Compound Flows and will thus
   need to be included in each exported Flow Record.  Of those fields,
   all fields, except those that were aggregated, form the Flow Key of
   Compound Flows, as defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture].

   +-----------+-------------+---------------+---------------+---------+
   | Selection | Aggregation |     Common    |    Specific   |   Flow  |
   |           |             |    Property   |    Property   |   Key   |
   +-----------+-------------+---------------+---------------+---------+
   | any       | discard     |               |               |         |
   | any       | keep        |               |       x       |    x    |
   | any       | mask        |               |       x       |    x    |
   | any       | aggregate   |               |       x       |         |
   | pattern   | discard     |       x       |               |         |
   | pattern   | keep        |       x       |       x       |    x    |
   | pattern   | mask        |       x       |       x       |    x    |
   | pattern   | aggregate   |       x       |       x       |         |
   +-----------+-------------+---------------+---------------+---------+

                    Table 2: Mapping Rules to Templates

   It should be noted that certain combinations of selection and
   aggregation instructions can cause undesirable side effects and



Dressler, et al.  draft-dressler-ipfix-aggregation-04.txt       [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           IPFIX Flow Aggregation            November 2007


   SHOULD NOT be used.  These combinations are:

   atomic pattern, do not discard:
      Selecting Flows to only allow a specific field value (as opposed
      to a range of values) and retaining this field as a discriminating
      property will lead to the transmission of the selection pattern as
      both a Common Property of all Compound Flows and a discriminating
      property.  If only an atomic pattern is used, the field can be
      discarded with no loss of information.

   any field value, discard:
      If neither a pattern nor a field modifier should apply to a field,
      it is sufficient for an Aggregation Rule to not include an
      instruction for this field.  Specifying for a field neither a
      pattern nor a modifier will mandate presence of the field for an
      incoming Flow to be eligible for aggregation, but not accomplish
      any real selection or aggregation.

   pattern, aggregate:
      Selecting Flows to only allow certain field values in non-
      discriminating properties, such as packet counters, then modifying
      these properties, can lead to semantic conflicts when interpreting
      the received Compound Flows.


5.  Example

   An Aggregation Rule shown in Table 3 will set up a stream of Compound
   Flows, creation of which is performed as follows.

   Selection:
      Only Flows containing at least fields for the source address,
      destination address, destination port, and the packet count will
      be considered for aggregation.  In addition, the destination
      address must be in the subnet 192.0.2.0/28 and the destination
      port must be equal to 80.

   Compound Flow creation:
      Destination addresses are merged according to subnets in
      192.0.2.0/30 and all packet counters of one Compound Flow are
      added up.

   Export:
      The resulting Compound Flow Records comprise the source address,
      the destination subnet address, and the packet counter as their
      specific properties, as well as a destination subnet of

       +--------------------------+--------------+----------------+
       | sourceIPv4Address        |              | keep           |
       | destinationIPv4Address   | 192.0.2.0/28 | mask to 30 bit |

       +--------------------------+--------------+----------------+

                     Table 3: Example Aggregation Rule

   Adding the Aggregation Rule shown in Table 4 and configuring it with
   a Preceding Rule, the Aggregation Rule of Table 3, will set up a
   second stream of Compound Flows, creation of which is performed as
   follows.

   Selection:
      As introduced in Section 4.2, Flows that were already aggregated
      according to the Preceding Rule will be skipped.  In addition,
      only Flows containing at least fields for the source address,
      destination address, destination port, and the packet count will
      be considered for aggregation.  Furthermore, the destination port
      of incoming Flows must be equal to 80.

   Compound Flow creation:
      Source and destination addresses are merged according to subnets
      in 192.0.2.0/30 and all packet counters of one Compound Flow are
      added up.

   Export:
      The resulting Compound Flow Records comprise the source subnet
      address, the destination subnet address, and the packet counter as
      their specific properties, as well as a destination port of 80 as
      their Common Property.  Furthermore, a Common Property of all
      Compound Flow Records is that they did not match the Preceding
      Rule, i.e. the combination of their destination subnet and
      destination port was not 192.0.2.0/28 and 80.

         +--------------------------+-----------+----------------+
         | IPFIX Field              | Selection | Aggregation    |

         | destinationTransportPort | 80        | discard        |

   The following example Table 5 illustrates the application of the
   described chain of Aggregation Rules to selected Flows.

   +-------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------+
   | Source IP   | Source    | Destination  | Destination    | Packets |
   |             | Port      | IP           | Port           |         |
   +-------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------+
   | 192.0.2.1   | 64235     | 192.0.2.101  | 80             | 10      |
   | 192.0.2.2   | 64236     | 192.0.2.102  | 110            | 10      |
   | 192.0.2.3   | 64237     | 192.0.2.103  | 80             | 10      |
   | 192.0.2.101 | 64238     | 192.0.2.1    | 80             | 10      |
   | 192.0.2.102 | 64239     | 192.0.2.2    | 80             | 10      |
   +-------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------+

                          Table 5: Incoming Flows

   Two sets of Compound Flows, as depicted in Table 6 and Table 7, will
   be exported in our example according to the Aggregation Rules shown
   in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.

       +-------------+----------------+------------------+---------+
       | Source IP   | Destination IP | Destination Port | Packets |
       +-------------+----------------+------------------+---------+
       | 192.0.2.101 | 192.0.2.0      | 80               | 10      |
       | 192.0.2.102 | 192.0.2.0      | 80               | 10      |
       +-------------+----------------+------------------+---------+

      Table 6: Compound Flows according to the first Aggregation Rule

        +-----------+----------------+------------------+---------+
        | Source IP | Destination IP | Destination Port | Packets |
        +-----------+----------------+------------------+---------+

6.  Open Issues

   While the aggregation methodology introduced in Section 4 solves most
   problems that could arise when doing Flow aggregation, some issues
   are left unresolved.  These issues require special attention or need
   to be addressed at higher layers and are presented in this section.

   One problem arises when received Option Data Records are forwarded by
   an aggregator.  Option Data Records that refer to an Observation
   Domain, e.g.  Data Records based on the Metering Process



Dressler, et al.  draft-dressler-ipfix-aggregation-04.txt      [Page 12]

   (Reliability) Statistics Option Template, only include an
   observationDomainId.  However, [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] only mandates
   that the observationDomainId be locally unique to an Exporting
   Process, so in order to unambiguously refer to an Observation Domain,
   an additional identifier of the Exporting Process would need to be
   transmitted.  While the selection of an Observation Domain ID that is
   unique to the aggregation domain would alleviate this issue, a more
   generic solution seems to be preferable.

   Another problem arises when different sources transmit Flows
   containing merely pseudonyms instead of IP addresses, and these Flows
   are to be aggregated e.g. by an IPFIX concentrator.  If an aggregator
   is not explicitly informed of the anonymous nature of received Flows,
   it assumes that identical IP address values refer to identical hosts,
   which might not be the case if Flow sources employ different
   algorithms to generate pseudonyms.


7.  Security Considerations

   As all methods described in this document are merely variations on
   methods already introduced in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], the same
   security considerations regarding exchange of Flow information apply.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
