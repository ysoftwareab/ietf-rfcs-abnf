Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Standards based IP mobility enabling protocols such as Mobile IP
   [RFC3344] [RFC3775], HIP [I-D.ietf-hip-arch], MOBIKE [I-D.ietf-
   mobike-design] and SCTP with address management support [I-D.ietf-
   tsvwg-addip-sctp] [mSCTP] are all mobile node centric.  Most handover
   related decision making is done in the mobile node only.

   Public mobile network access is gaining increased offer diversity,
   both in terms of the types of access technologies, in terms of the
   diversity of the offer (with clear separation of roles between access
   and service providers), and in terms of the size of that offer.  This
   diversity has been compounded by increasing number of multi-access
   capable terminals equipped with IP technologies.  Overall, this
   creates a complex environment, where the mobile terminal might not
   have enough information or even the possibility to make an
   intelligent handover decision.  In fact, handover decisions and
   inherent target network selection is not necessarily anymore based on
   access availability but further depends on policies and commercial
   roaming arrangements on access network level, access provider level
   and service provider level.  Furthermore, the information required
   for an intelligent target network selection might change periodically
   in such a frequency that maintaining all knowledge (and intelligence)
   in the mobile node might not be viable anymore.  Only the network
   will have some of this information.  However, none of the mobility
   protocols above referred have capabilities or procedures to
   significantly involve the network side entities in intelligent
   handover decision making.

   A good example of the type of information only available to the
   network is the situation with radio resource usage.  It is expected
   that radio resource usage optimization will be a task of major
   relevance in future wireless network environments, with millions of
   users roaming between access routers across multiple technologies
   (i.e. 802.11, 802.16, e.g. [draft-cui-mobopts-hcf-wlan-00]).  This
   function can resort to mechanisms and algorithms able to gather
   measurements and force terminal handovers between cells.  The
   handover can be issued according to predefined mobility patterns,
   mechanisms for intelligent flow balancing, mechanisms for optimized
   resource re-allocation, mechanisms for user-traffic performance
   optimization, or mechanisms for user profiling (e.g. access rights) -
   all of them ultimately leading to better service to be provided to
   the users.  For these expectations to be realized, network control
   capabilities are required in order to provide this ability to force
   specific terminals to perform handovers, either between access points
   or between different technologies.

   Going even further, handovers over administrative domains i.e. inter-

   domain handovers are not explicitly prohibited with the existing IP
   mobility enabling protocols but at the same time these protocols are
   not designed or optimized for such cases in any way.  Also a general
   network controlled triggering mechanism for a handover from an
   administrative domain to another does not currently exists.  An
   emulated behavior could somehow be achieved through selective misuse
   of AAA like it is done on cellular side voice oriented systems these
   days.

   This problem statement document describes various scenarios where
   handovers could be network initiated, even over administrative
   domains, presenting some ideas on architecture for this situation.
   This, however, will further require a new handover triggering
   mechanism that originates from entities located in the network side,
   and is acted upon by entities on the mobile node.  These network side
   entities may also be located in other administrative domains that the
   mobile node is currently visiting.  This document also discusses and
   lists a set of goals and non-goals for further work that aims at
   enabling network initiated and assisted handovers even over
   administrative domains.

1.1.  Overview of the problem

   Current standard mobility protocols provide Internet connectivity to
   mobile nodes roaming from one access router to another.  To reduce
   handover latency extensions have been proposed and are currently in
   the stage to be accepted as experimental RFC.  In all these
   approaches, handover is still initiated by the mobile terminal.  In
   this document we present a list of requirements according to which
   this characteristic is not adequate, and the protocols need to be
   extended with handover initiation by the network.

   There has been consensus in the last months to split local mobility
   from global mobility.  Local mobility in the access network mainly
   optimizes control signaling by reducing the need to update the home/
   visited network about user mobility.  Local mobility can be handled
   independently of the global mobility.  As an example, the netlmm
   working group charter has the task to study and specify a protocol to
   enable mobile devices to move across an access network by reducing to
   the minimum the complexity in the terminal itself.  Therefore the
   network is requested to handle user mobility by means of appropriate
   scheme.

   In this proposal the trigger for host route update executed by the
   network (which is actually an handover execution) is originating in
   the terminal.  By means of layer two mechanisms (e.g. link up or link
   down in IEEE 802.11) or layer three mechanisms (e.g.  Neighbor
   discovery) the terminal is detected on the new link and the route to



Melia, et al.            Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


   the host updated for packet delivery.  Thus, the whole network
   involvement is simply support of routing update.  The real trigger/
   decision comes, once again, from the terminal.

   In [I-D.daniel-mip-link-characteristic] some specifications are
   provided to enable Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 capable nodes to
   exchange link information with the HA and any CN.  However, to
   generalize the approach, the link characteristics exchange should
   happen during the handover process, since the Binding Update
   handshake conclude the handover process, when (bicasted) packets are
   already routed to the new Care-of Address (nCoA).  For instance,
   specialized traffic shapers could be installed in the ARs to adapt a
   selected MT-CN flow to the specific underlying wireless/wire line
   access technology.

   As an example of the relevance of the proposed strategy, it is
   expected that predictive or stochastic algorithms could be
   implemented at the network side (leaving less complex logic for the
   MN) to perform handover decision depending on the mobile user
   environment.  For that additional (to the link characteristics)
   parameters such as bit rate, quality of service parameters (e.g. in
   IEEE 802.11e) , radio frequency, MN's view of the access point signal
   level, network view of the MN's sending power and roaming related
   information may have to be evaluated prior to any handover decision.

   This kind of approach has been described, for instance, in
   [draft-cui-mobopts-hcf-wlan-00] where a WLAN scenario is presented
   and extensions to Mobile IPv6 messages are introduced to support an
   handover control function for handover decision.

   The approaches described represent only a subset on the potential
   scenarios for real deployment.  For incorporating future technologies
   seamlessly it is essential that specific solutions are framed under a
   general solution.

   By adding network control to such hierarchical deployment (local and
   global mobility domains), mobile operators gain additional control on
   user mobility whilst taking into account resource allocation to
   guarantee reliable end to end services.

   In this document we identify a problem statement highlighting future
   network requirements, showing potential architectural ideas for
   achieving these results.

1.2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key

   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [1].

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   ASP

      Access Service provider.  A network operator that provides direct
      IP packet forwarding to and from the end host.

   MRMH

      Mobility and Roaming Manager, usually located at home network.
      The Roaming Manager part is aware of administrative relationships
      between the home network, various ISPs and possibly with various
      NAPs as well.

   MRMV

      Mobility and Roaming Manager located at visited network.  MRMV is
      generally delegated representative of MRMH in the visited network.

   MSP

      Mobility Service provider.  A service provider that provides IP
      mobility services.  In order to obtain such service, the mobile
      node must be authenticated and prove authorization to obtain the
      service.

   NIHO

      Network initiated and assisted handover.

   AN

      Access Network composed of several access routers.  Identified as
      well as local mobility domain.


2.  Assumptions

   This document has some few fundamental assumptions concerning the
   general networking environment and network initiated handovers.  The
   rest of the document makes use of the following assumptions:






Melia, et al.            Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


   o  Reusing existing security mechanisms -- The mobile node does not
      need to create a new security mechanism in order to enable network
      initiated and assisted handover triggering.  The mobile node
      should reuse the existing security associations it created while
      establishing the initial access to the network and its mobility
      service provider (MSP).

   o  All mobile nodes within the scope of this document are expected to
      support at least one (potentially modified) existing or future IP
      mobility enabling protocol.

   o  All mobile nodes, correspondent nodes and mobility management
      nodes are not expected to understand or support network initiated
      and assisted handovers.  When either peer lacks support for
      network initiated and assisted handover triggering and signaling
      the peer supporting these features must fall back to the base IP
      mobility protocol mechanisms.

   o  The network initiated handover concept relies on the presence of a
      centralized functional entity.  This entity controls the network
      side and implement the intelligence to select nodes and targets
      access routers.  It is not in the scope of this document to
      specify the policies that will be implemented here.

   o  To provide adequate scalable support, distributed functions are
      required to support the above functional entity.  This gives more
      flexibility to the overall architecture and protocol operation.

   o  It is envisioned the presence of multi wireless access, such as
      802.11, 802.16, UMTS, forming an heterogeneous composition of
      macro and micro cells.  The network support SHOULD leverage user
      mobility focusing on vertical handovers.  Hence, the terminal does
      not need to apply filtering criteria to select a target network.
      (which could be an expensive operation in heterogeneous
      environments)

   o  Performing network initiated handover has the main implication
      that the network has first to assess the terminal view of the
      network.  Signal level evaluation is a important matter when
      coming down to user mobility.  This is typically very well handled
      with terminal initiated handovers and automatic evaluation of
      signal level.  Different methods apply to different technologies.

   o  Neighborhood discovery relates to the above assumption when
      neighborhood scanning is requested from the network.  It is
      expected these functions to be available on the terminal side.

3.  Scenarios and Requirements

   This section describes few usage scenarios where the network
   initiated and assisted handover could be justified and deployed.
   Also we list here initial requirements for the general network
   initiated and assisted handover functionality.

3.1.  Administrative domain wise considerations

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 introduce two different possible scenarios.  In
   the first case one single administrative scenario is described.  The
   Mobile Operator (MO) owns both the ISPs and the NAPs.  It provides as
   well mobility services.  This is the simplest case where security
   restrictions are less relevant.  The MO has therefore full control.

   Figure 2 illustrates another example architecture, where the
   signaling and triggering relationship between home network domain,
   ISP domain, NAP domain and the mobile node domain are shown.  Each of
   previously mentioned technical domains may belong to a different
   administrative domain.

   Figure 2: An overall architecture for network initiated and assisted
   handovers over multiple administrative domains

   The architecture in Figure 2 has been divided into three different
   domains.  Domain 1 represents the home network or the services
   provider that owns and manages user's subscription.  It eventually
   contains Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as well.

   Domain 2 contains Network Access Providers (NAPs).  A NAP provides
   access services for one or more Home Networks.

   Domain 3 is the mobile node and may also represent the end user.  The
   end user does not need to have any relationship with NAPs or ISPs in
   order the gain access to the services accessible through the home
   network.

3.2.  Technology wise considerations

   In the previous section we provided an high level view of network
   relationships between the different entities involved.  Figure 1 and
   Figure 2 describes a general network view without describing which
   technologies are supported and where optimizations take place.  It is
   clear MO will have different environment deployments.  In the
   following we give some examples on how technologies can be mapped to
   NAP implementing several Access Networks and creating complex
   overlapping of macro and micro cells scenarios.

   Figure 3: Micro and Micro cells overlapping scenario

   These cells can be actually owned by the same or by different NAPs.
   In any case, the MRMH will collect information about all these cells
   (as visible from the terminal) across the different domains.

3.3.  NIHO Application Areas

   At this point in time we foresee three possible application areas
   that are listed and briefly described in the following section.  Each
   application area uses the NIHO triggering and signaling as part of
   their tasks.

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


   o  Application for Mobility Reasons

      The general idea is to handle user mobility from the network side.
      This particular application requires network capabilities to
      request measurements and evaluate technologies specific link
      conditions.  The approach can be considered similar to what
      current mobile networks do.

      As an example, if we consider WLAN environments, the network could
      gather (both proactive or reactive approaches apply) terminal
      related information and select target access points/access
      routers.  Previous experiences [Measurement Module for mobility
      management in WLAN networks] already demonstrated the feasibility
      of the approach.  The key idea is to deploy networks able to see
      terminal positions upon request of measurements performed either
      at the edge of the network or at the terminal.  Scalability
      considerations have to be done with respect to the overhead
      introduced in terms of protocol operations and traffic load in the
      network.

   o  Application for Resource Optimization Reasons

      As mentioned before, network optimization is a delicate issue when
      resources are scarce, especially in the access network.  Although
      standards able to support natively quality of services
      capabilities are becoming mature to be sold on the market
      (802.11e), networks are not yet ready to support these new
      technologies.  A cross layer design is therefore required to
      convey link layer specific information to decision points located
      in the access network.

      These decision points will then execute resource optimization
      algorithms given the existing traffic requirements and the
      existing network capabilities.

   o  Application for inter-domain handover

      Handovers that cause the mobile to cross administrative domain
      borders involve inter-domain signaling.  One example of this kind
      of scenario is when the mobile node moves between different NAPs
      under the same ISP or when even the ISP changes as a result of the
      movement.  In both of these scenarios the NIHO signaling could be
      used to prepare the new target domain (either ISP and/or NAP) for
      the arriving mobile node.  Especially if the handover was
      initiated from the network side, the handover initiating network
      could help distributing all security, policies, billing and
      service related material cross administrative domains before the
      mobile node arrives.

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


3.4.  Network assistance with global mobility management

   This aspect is particularly important for inter-domain handovers.
   The network will provide information required for speeding the
   handover.  This information is related with two types of data: i)
   operator related data, such as billing information, policies, etc..;
   ii) terminal related data, such as security associations.

3.5.  Network assistance with local mobility management

   This aspect is particularly important for resource optimization and
   intra-domain handovers.  The network will provide information to lead
   (or impose) the mobile terminal to associate to specific access
   points.

3.6.  Inter-domain handovers

   Inter-domain handovers and inter-domain handover preparations require
   entities involved in the triggering and signaling to have security
   relationships in place between them.  For example the MRMH located at
   the home network (service provider) must have a security relationship
   between all ISPs the end user can use for accessing services.  Also
   ISPs must have security relationship between all NAPs the end user
   can use for accessing services.  However, NAPs do no necessarily need
   to have any relationship with the actual service provider.  And going
   even further the end user does not need to have any relationship
   between NAPs and ISPs, only with the service provider.  It is service
   provider's duty to grant access to services via any NAP and ISP the
   service provider has a direct or indirect pre-setup relationship.

   In addition to obvious security and AAA related challenges between
   the service operator, ISPs and NAPs, the general when and why to
   trigger a handover towards the mobile node is not a trivial task.
   The service provider's home network needs to have rather exact and up
   to date knowledge of the mobile node's current topological location
   and surrounding network conditions before it should trigger a
   handover on the mobile node due same policy decision at the home
   network.  Example of such policy decisions is when a mobile node
   roams (after a handover) to a target network the home network does
   not want the end user to use for the active service set the end user
   has requested.  As a consequence the home network MRMH triggers a new
   handover suggestion towards the mobile node indicating a more
   feasible target network (based on the information the mobile node has
   previously signaled to the home network MRMH).  Another home network
   policy decision could be distributing roaming end users in visited
   networks based on some distribution criteria.  Such criteria could,
   for example, be directing voice users to ISP A network, where as data
   service users to ISP B network.  A simpler rationale can be simply

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


   redirecting the user to the mobile network whose charges are lower at
   that time.

   The whole policy mechanism in the home network MRMH is a complex
   issue and out of scope of this document.  However, the home network
   MRMH needs information of its end users from dedicated NAP and ISP
   entities.  These information aggregating entities are discussed in
   more detail in Section 4.


4.  Framework and Functional Components

   We can draw on the previous considerations to derive a framework
   view.

   We need the following basic components:

   o  Policy Decision Point

      This could be on the MRMH or MRML depending on the case.

   o  Policy Enforcement Point

      Namely the access routers

   o  Measurements Functions

      Collectively distributed between the access routers and the mobile
      terminals.

   o  Aggregators Components

      The functionalities can be located at different points in the
      network.

   Overall, the PDP will retrieve data from the Measurement blocks both
   in the network, and from the mobile terminal.  The PDP will issue
   policies to the PEPs, that will impose the policies.


5.  Design considerations

5.1.  Goals

   This section lists the general goals for the network initiated and
   assisted handovers framework design.  The network initiated and
   assisted handover framework solution MUST fulfil all the goals listed
   below:



Melia, et al.            Expires April 20, 2006                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers          October 2005


   G1 Independent of the IP mobility management mechanism -- The network
      initiated and assisted handover triggering mechanism must be
      independent of any particular IP mobility management protocol.
      However, there might be mappings/implementations of the triggering
      mechanism to a specific IP mobility protocol such as Mobile IP.

   G2 Work over administrative domains e.g. in inter-domain handover
      cases or when a multi-homed host is attached to multiple ISPs.

   G3 Provide similar degree of security as existing with the current
      security protocols.

5.2.  Non-goals

   This section lists issues that are considered as strictly out of
   scope of this problem statement and requirements document.

   o  Designing a new security framework in order to enable network
      initiated and assisted handover triggering.

   o  Initial bootstrapping problem -- The mechanism to gain the initial
      access to some network is out of scope of.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new name spaces to be managed by
   IANA.  This document does not either reserve any new numbers or names
   under any existing name space managed by IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, the threats to network
   initiated and assisted IP handovers in general, and signaling and
   triggering between the mobile node and corresponding network entities
   are not widely understood, particularly in the inter-domain handover
   case when the signaling and triggering takes place across
   administrative domains.  Part of the experimental task in preparing
   network initiated and assisted handovers (even across administrative
   domains) for eventual standards track will be to better characterize
   threats to network initiated and assisted handovers, inter-domain
   triggering and signaling, and design specific mechanisms to counter
   them.
