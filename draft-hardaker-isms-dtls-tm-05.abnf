tmTransportDomain  = snmpTLSDomain, snmpDTLSUDPDomain or
          snmpDTLSSCTPDomain as appropriate.
tmTransportAddress  = The address the message originated from,
          determined in an implementation dependent way.

tmSecurityLevel  = The derived tmSecurityLevel for the session,
          as discussed in Section 3.1.2 and Section 5.3.

tmSecurityName  = The derived tmSecurityName for the session as
          discussed in and Section 5.3.  This value MUST be constant
          during the lifetime of the (D)TLS session.

tmSessionID  = The tlsSessionID, which MUST be A unique session
          identifier for this (D)TLS session.  The contents and format
          of this identifier are implementation dependent as long as it
          is unique to the session.  A session identifier MUST NOT be
          reused until all references to it are no longer in use.  The
          tmSessionID is equal to the tlsSessionID discussed in
          Section 5.1.1. tmSessionID refers to the session identifier
          when stored in the tmStateReference and tlsSessionID refers to
          the session identifier when stored in the LCD.  They MUST
          always be equal when processing a given session's traffic.
