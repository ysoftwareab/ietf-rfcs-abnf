Abstract

   This document specifies an ATM-based protocol for communication
   between ST2+ agents. The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports the matching
   of one hop in an ST2+ tree-structure stream with one ATM connection.
   In this document, ATM is a subnet technology for the ST2+ stream.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol is designed to achieve resource-
   reservation communications across ATM and non-ATM networks, to extend
   the UNI 3.1/4.0 signaling functions, and to reduce the UNI 4.0 LIJ
   signaling limitations.

   The specifications of the ST2+ over ATM protocol consist of a
   revision of RFC 1819 ST2+ and specifications of protocol interaction
   between ST2+ and ATM on the user plane, management plane, and control
   plane which correspond to the three planes of the B-ISDN protocol
   reference model.

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose of Document

   The purpose of this document is to specify an ATM-based protocol for
   communication between ST2+ agents.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol is designed to support the matching of one
   hop in an ST2+ tree-structure stream with one ATM connection; it is
   not designed to support an entire ST2+ tree-structure stream with a
   point-to-multipoint ATM connection only.

   Therefore, in this document, ATM is only a subnet technology for the
   ST2+ stream.  This specification is designed to enable resource-
   reservation communications across ATM and non-ATM networks.


1.2 Features of ST2+ over ATM Protocol

   o Enables resource-reservation communications across ATM and non-ATM
     networks.

     ATM native API supports resource-reservation communications only
     within an ATM network; it cannot support interworking with non-ATM
     networks. This is because

     - ATM native API cannot connect terminals without an ATM interface.

     - ATM native API does not support IP addressing and SAP (port)
       addressing systems.

   o Extends UNI 3.1/4.0 signaling functions.

     ST2+ SCMP supports MTU-size negotiation at all hops in an ST2+
     tree-structure stream. UNI 3.1/4.0 supports only max CPCS_SDU
     (i.e., MTU) negotiation with the called party of a point-to-point
     call or with the first leaf of a point-to-multipoint call.

   o Reduces UNI 4.0 LIJ signaling limitations.

     The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports UNI 4.0 LIJ Call Identifier
     notification from the root to the leaf by using an ST2+ SCMP
     extension.  LIJ Call Identifier discovery at the leaf is one of the
     major unsolved problems of UNI 4.0, and the ST2+ over ATM protocol
     provides a solution.

     Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
     support the above feature. It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0

     version.


1.3 Goals and Non-goals of ST2+ over ATM Protocol

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol is designed to achieve the following
   goals.

   o Specify protocol interaction between ST2+ [4] and ATM on the ATM
     Forum Private UNI 3.1/4.0 (Sb point) [5].

     Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
     support UNI 4.0. It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0 version.

   o Support ST2+ stream across ATM and non-ATM networks.

   o Define one VC on the UNI corresponding to one ST2+ hop; this VC is
     not shared with other ST2+ hops, and also this ST2+ hop is not
     divided into multiple VCs.

   o Support both SVC and PVC.

   o Not require any ATM specification changes.

   o Coexist with RFC 1483 [14] IPv4 encapsulation.

   o Coexist with RFC 1577 [15] ATMarp.

   o Coexist with RFC 1755 [16] ATM signaling for IPv4.

   o Coexist with NHRP [17].

   o Incorporate the I.371 [13] ITU-T new traffic control recommendation
     for ATM WAN connectivity.

   Because ST2+ is independent of both routing and IP address resolution
   protocols, the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not specify the following
   protocols.

   o IP-ATM address resolution protocol

   o Routing protocol

   Because the ST2+ over ATM protocol is specified for the UNI, it is
   independent of:

   o NNI protocol

   o Router/switch architecture


2. Protocol Architecture

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol specifies the interaction between ST2+ and
   ATM on the user, management, and control planes, which correspond to
   the three planes in ITU-T Recommendation I.321 B-ISDN Protocol
   Reference Model [10].


2.1 User Plane Architecture

   The user plane specifies the rules for encapsulating the ST2+ Data
   PDU into the AAL5 [12] or AAL1 [11] PDU. An user plane protocol stack
   is shown in Fig. 2.1.

   If AAL1 is used for encapsulating the ST2+ Data PDU, the 12 bytes ST
   header is not mapped to the AAL1 PDU, and the value of the Pri field
   in the ST2+ Data PDU header is lost.

   An example of interworking from an ATM network to an IEEE 802.X LAN
   is shown in Fig. 2.2.

   The ATM cell supports priority indication using the CLP field;
   indication is also supported by the ST2+ Data PDU by using the Pri
   field.  It may be feasible to map these fields to each other.  The
   ST2+ over ATM protocol specifies an optional function that maps the
   Pri field in the ST header to the CLP field in the ATM cell.
   However, implementors should note that current ATM standardization
   tends not to support tagging, and also that this optional function
   assumes the value of the Pri field can be obtained in the ATM
   network.


2.2 Management Plane Architecture

   The management plane specifies, or refers to a document that
   specifies, the Controlled-Load Service [6] FlowSpec and the
   Guaranteed Service [7] FlowSpec mapping rules for UNI 3.1 traffic
   management.  A management plane protocol stack is shown in Fig. 2.3.

   +---------------------------------+
   Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
   support UNI 4.0.  It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0 version.

   Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
   support Guaranteed Services. It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0
   version.

                Fig. 2.3: Management plane protocol stack.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol specifies the ST FlowSpec format for the
   Integrated Services.  Basically, FlowSpec parameter negotiation,
   except for the MTU, is not supported.  This is because, in the ST2+
   environment, negotiated FlowSpec parameters are not always unique to
   each target.  The current ATM standard does not support heterogeneous
   QoS to receivers.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports FlowSpec changes by using the
   CHANGE message (RFC 1819, Section 4.6.5) if the I-bit in the CHANGE
   message is set to one and if the CHANGE message affects all targets
   in the stream. This is because the current ATM standard does not
   support QoS changes. The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports FlowSpec
   changes by releasing old ATM connections and establishing new ones.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not support stream preemption (RFC
   1819, Section 6.3).  This is because the Integrated Services FlowSpec
   does not support the concept of precedence.

   It does not support the ST2+ FlowSpec (RFC 1819, Section 9.2).  ST2+
   FlowSpec specifies useful services, but requires a data link layer to
   support heterogeneous QoS to receivers.  The current ATM standard
   does not support heterogeneous QoS to receivers.

2.3 Control Plane Architecture

   The control plane specifies the relationship between ST2+ SCMP and
   PVC management for ST2+ data and the protocol interaction between
   ST2+ SCMP and Q.2931 UNI signaling [5, 9]. A control plane protocol
   stack is shown in Fig. 2.4.

                  Fig. 2.4: Control plane protocol stack.

   The ST2+ SCMP PDU is mapped to the AAL5 PDU based on the RFC 1483 LLC
   encapsulation format. The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not cover a VC
   (SVC/PVC) that transfers ST2+ SCMP. VCs for IPv4 transfer may be used
   for ST2+ SCMP transfer, and implementations may provide particular
   VCs for ST2+ SCMP transfer. Selection of these VCs depends on the
   implementation.

   Implementors should note that when ST2+ data and SCMP belong to a
   stream, the routing directions on the ST2+ layer must be the same.
   Implementors should also note that ST2+ and IPv4 directions for
   routing to the same IP destination address are not always the same.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports both SVC and PVC for ST2+ Data
   PDU transfer.  If SVC is used, the ST2+ and ATM layers establish a
   connection sequentially by using respectively ST2+ SCMP and Q.2931.
   An example of ST2+ SCMP and Q.2931 message flows for establishing and
   releasing of ST2+ data connections is shown in Fig. 2.5, where (S)
   means an ST2+ entity and (Q) means a Q.2931 entity.

   UNI 3.1/4.0 specifies PVC, point-to-point SVC, and point-to-
   multipoint SVC as VC styles. However, in actual ATM network
   environments, especially public ATM WANs, only PVC and bi-directional
   point-to-point SVC may be supported.  To support the diverse VC
   styles, the ST2+ over ATM protocol supports the following VC styles
   for ST2+ Data PDU transfer.

   o PVC

   o Reuse of reverse channel of bi-directional point-to-point SVC that
     is used by existing stream.

   o Point-to-point SVC initiated from upstream side.

   o Point-to-multipoint SVC initiated from upstream side.

   o Point-to-point SVC initiated from downstream side.

   o Point-to-multipoint SVC initiated from downstream side (LIJ).

     Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
     support LIJ.  LIJ will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0 version.

   The second style is needed in environments supporting bi-directional
   point-to-point SVC only.  The selection of PVC and SVC styles in the
   ST2+ agent is based on preconfigured implementation-dependent rules.

   SVC supports both upstream and downstream call initiation styles.
   Implementors should note that this is independent of the sender-
   oriented and receiver-oriented ST2+ stream-building process (RFC
   1819, Section 4.1.1).  This is because the ST2+ over ATM protocol
   specifies the process for establishing ST2+ data hops on the UNI, and
   because the ST2+ stream building process belongs to another layer.
   The SVC initiation side should be determined based on the operational
   and billing policies between ST2+ agents; this is basically
   independent of the sender-oriented and receiver-oriented ST2+
   stream-building process.

   An example of ST2+ SCMP interworking is shown in Fig. 2.6.

3. Revision of RFC 1819 ST2+

   To specify the ST2+ over ATM protocol, the functions in RFC 1819 ST2+
   must be extended to support ATM.  However, it is difficult for the
   current ATM standard to support part of the specifications in RFC
   1819 ST2+. This section specifies the extended, restricted, and
   unsupported functions in RFC 1819 ST2+.  Errata for RFC 1819 appears
   in Appendix A.


3.1 Extended Functions of RFC 1819 ST2+

3.1.1 ST FlowSpec for Controlled-Load Service

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol specifies the ST FlowSpec format for the
   Integrated Services.  Basically, FlowSpec parameter negotiation,
   except for the MTU, is not supported.  The ST2+ intermediate agent
   and the target decide whether to accept or refuse the FlowSpec
   parameters, except for the MTU.  Therefore, each of the FlowSpec
   parameter values other than MTU is the same at each target in the
   stream.

   The format of the ST FlowSpec for the Controlled-Load Service is
   shown in Fig. 3.1.

     The PCode field identifies common SCMP elements.  The PCode value
     for the ST2+ FlowSpec is 1.

     The PBytes field for the Controlled-Load Service is 36 bytes.

     The ST FS Ver (ST FlowSpec Version) field identifies the ST
     FlowSpec version.  The ST FlowSpec version number for the
     Integrated Services is 8.

     The Ver (Message Format Version) field identifies the Integrated
     Services FlowSpec message format version.  The current version is
     zero.

     The Overall Length field for the Controlled-Load Service is 7
     words.

     The SVC Number (Service ID Number) field identifies the Integrated
     Services.  If the Integrated Services FlowSpec appears in the
     CONNECT or the CHANGE message, the value of the SVC Number field is
     1.  If it appears in the ACCEPT, the NOTIFY, or the STATUS-RESPONSE
     message, the value of the SVC Number field is 5.

     The SVC Length (Service-specific Data Length) field for the
     Controlled-Load Service is 6 words.

     The Param Num (Parameter Number) field is 127.

     The Flags (Per-parameter Flags) field is zero.

     The Param Length (Length of Per-parameter Data) field is 5 words.

     Definitions of the Token Bucket Rate [r], the Token Bucket Size
     [b], the Peak Data Rate [p], the Minimum Policed Unit [m], and the
     Maximum Packet Size [M] fields are given in [6].  See section 5 of
     [6] for details.

   The ST2+ agent, that creates the FlowSpec element in the SCMP
   message, must assign valid values to all fields. The other agents
   must not modify any values in the element.

   The MaxMsgSize field in the CONNECT message is assigned by the origin
   or the intermediate agent acting as origin, and updated by each agent
   based on the MTU value of the datalink layer.

   The negotiated value of MaxMsgSize is set back to the origin or the
   intermediate agent acting as origin using the [M] field and the
   MaxMsgSize field in the ACCEPT message that corresponds to the
   CONNECT message.

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


   In the original definition of the Controlled-Load Service, the value
   of the [m] field must be less than or equal to the value of the [M]
   field.  However, in the ST FlowSpec for the Controlled-Load Service,
   if the value of the [m] field is more than that of the [M] field, the
   value of the [m] field is regarded as the same value as the [M]
   field, and must not generate an error. This is because there is a
   possibility that the value of the [M] field in the ACCEPT message may
   be decreased by negotiation.

   In the ST2+ SCMP messages, the value of the [M] field must be equal
   to or less than 65,535.  In the ACCEPT message that responds to
   CONNECT, or the NOTIFY message that contains the FlowSpec field, the
   value of the [M] field must be equal to the MaxMsgSize field in the
   message.  If these values are not the same, FlowSpec is regarded as
   an error.

   If the ST2+ agent receives the CONNECT message that contains
   unacceptable FlowSpec, the agent must generate a REFUSE message.

3.1.2 ST FlowSpec for Guaranteed Service

   Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
   support Guaranteed Services. It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0
   version.

3.1.3 VC-type common SCMP element

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol specifies an additional common SCMP
   element that designates the VC type used to support the diverse VC
   styles.  The CONNECT and CHANGE messages that pass across UNIs must
   contain a VC-type common SCMP element.  This element is valid between
   neighboring ST2+ agents, but must not propagate beyond the previous-
   hop or next-hop ST2+ agent.

   The format of the VC-type common SCMP element is shown in Fig. 3.2.

             Fig. 3.2: Format of VC-type common SCMP element.

     The PCode field identifies the common SCMP elements. The PCode
     value for the VC type is 8.

     The PBytes field for the VC type is 20 bytes.

     The VCType field identifies the VC type.  The correspondence
     between the value in this field and the meaning is as follows:

       0: ST2+ data stream uses a PVC.

       1: ST2+ data stream uses the reverse channel of the bi-
          directional point-to-point SVC used by the existing stream.

       2: ST2+ data stream is established by a point-to-point SVC
          initiated from the upstream side.

       3: ST2+ data stream is established by a point-to-multipoint SVC
          initiated from the upstream side.

       4: ST2+ data stream is established by a point-to-point SVC
          initiated from the downstream side.

       5: ST2+ data stream is established by a point-to-multipoint SVC
          initiated from the downstream side.

       Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not
       support VCType 5. It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0
       version.

     The PVCIdentifer field identifies the PVC identifier uniquely
     assigned between neighboring ST2+ agents. This field is valid only
     when the VCType field is zero.

     The UniqueID and OriginIPAddress fields identify the reverse
     channel of the bi-directional point-to-point SVC that is used by
     this SID.  These fields are valid only when the VCType field is 1.

     The LIJCallIdentifer field identifies the LIJ Call Identifier for
     point-to-multipoint SVC. This field is valid only when the VCType
     field is 5.

3.1.4 Reason Code

   The extension of the Reason Code (RFC 1819, Section 10.5.3) to the
   ST2+ over ATM protocol is shown below.

     57 CantChange   Partial changes not supported.
     58 NoRecover    Stream recovery not supported.


3.2 Restricted Functions of RFC 1819 ST2+

3.2.1 Pri field in ST2+ Data PDU

   If AAL1 is used for encapsulating the ST2+ Data PDU, the value of the
   Pri field in the ST2+ Data PDU header is lost.

3.2.2 FlowSpec changes

   In the following cases, the ST2+ over ATM protocol supports stream
   FlowSpec changes by using the CHANGE message.

   o The I-bit is set to 1 and the G-bit is set to 1.

   o The I-bit is set to 1, the G-bit is set to zero, and the TargetList
     matches all downstream targets.

   In the following cases, the CHANGE fails and a REFUSE message, with
   the E and N-bits set to 1 and the ReasonCode set to CantChange, is
   propagated upstream.

   o The I-bit is set to zero.

   o The I-bit is set to 1, the G-bit is set to zero, and the TargetList
     does not match all downstream targets.

3.3 Unsupported Functions of RFC 1819 ST2+

3.3.1 ST2+ FlowSpec

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not support the ST2+ FlowSpec (RFC
   1819, Section 9.2).  The ST2+ FlowSpec specifies useful services, but
   requires the data link layer to support heterogeneous QoS to
   receivers.  The current ATM standard does not support heterogeneous
   QoS to receivers.

3.3.2 Stream preemption

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not support stream preemption (RFC
   1819, Section 6.3).  This is because the Integrated Services FlowSpec
   does not support the concept of precedence.

3.3.3 HELLO message

   Implementations may not support the HELLO message (RFC 1819, Section
   10.4.7) and thus ST2+ agent failure detection using the HELLO message
   (RFC 1819, Section 6.1.2). This is because ATM has an adequate
   failure detection mechanism, and the HELLO message is not sufficient
   for detecting link failure in the ST2+ over ATM protocol, because the
   ST2+ data and the ST2+ SCMP are forwarded through another VC.

3.3.4 Stream recovery

   Implementors must select the NoRecover option of the CONNECT message
   (RFC 1819, Section 4.4.1) with the S-bit set to 1.  This is because
   the descriptions of the stream recovery process in RFC 1819 (Sections
   5.3.2, 6.2, and 6.2.1) are unclear and incomplete. It is thus
   possible that if a link failure occurs and several ST2+ agents detect
   it simultaneously, the recovery process may encounter problems.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not support stream recovery. If
   recovery is needed, the application should support it. A CONNECT
   message in which the NoRecover option is not selected will fail; a
   REFUSE message in which the N-bit is set to 1 and the ReaseonCode is
   set to NoRecover is then propagated upstream.

3.3.5 IP encapsulation of ST

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not support IP encapsulation of ST
   (RFC 1819, Section 8.7), because there is no need to implement IP
   encapsulation in this protocol.

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


3.3.6 IP Multicasting

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not support IP multicasting (RFC
   1819, Section 8.8), because this protocol does not support IP
   encapsulation of ST.


4. Protocol Specification of the User Plane

   This section specifies the AAL5 [12] and AAL1 [11] PDU
   encapusulations for the ST2+ Data PDU. On the ST2+ over ATM user
   plane, AAL5 support is mandatory and AAL1 support is optional.


4.1 Service Primitives Provided by User Plane

4.1.1 Overview of interactions

   The ST2+ data layer entity on the user plane of the ST2+ over ATM
   protocol provides the following services to the upper layer.

   o st2p_unitdata.req

   o st2p_unitdata.ind

4.1.1.1 St2p_unitdata.req

   The st2p_unitdata.req primitive sends a request for an ST2+ Data PDU
   transfer to the ST2+ data layer entity.  The semantics of the
   primitive are as follows:

   st2p_unitdata.req (
           pri,
           sid,
           data
           )

   The pri parameter specifies priority of ST2+ Data PDU.  The sid
   parameter specifies SID of ST2+ Data PDU.  The data parameter
   specifies ST2+ data to be transferred.

4.1.1.2 St2p_unitdata.ind

   The st2p_unitdata.ind primitive indicates an ST2+ Data PDU delivery
   from the ST2+ data layer entity.  The semantics of the primitive are
   as follows:

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


   st2p_unitdata.ind (
           pri [optional],
           sid,
           data,
           status [optional]
           )


   The pri parameter indicates priority of ST2+ Data PDU, if AAL5 is
   used for encapsulating the ST2+ Data PDU.  The sid parameter
   indicates SID of ST2+ Data PDU.  The data parameter indicates
   delivered ST2+ data.  The status is an optional parameter that
   indicates whether the delivered ST2+ data is corrupt or not.


4.2 Service Primitives Provided by AAL5

4.2.1 Requirements for AAL5

   The requirements for the AAL5 layer on the ST2+ over ATM user plane
   are as follows:

   o The SSCS must be null.

   o Implementations must use message-mode service.

     Note: Selection of the corrupted SDU delivery option on the
     receiver side depends on the implementation, so the receiver may or
     may not be able to select this option.

4.2.2 Overview of Interactions

   The AAL5 layer entity on the ST2+ over ATM user plane provides the
   following services to the ST2+ data layer.

   o AAL5_UNITDATA.req

   o AAL5_UNITDATA.ind

4.2.2.1 AAL5_UNITDATA.req

   The AAL5_UNITDATA.req primitive sends a request for an AAL5 data
   (AAL5 CPCS_SDU) transfer from the ST2+ data layer entity to the AAL5
   layer entity.  The semantics of the primitive are as follows:

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


   AAL5_UNITDATA.req (
           DATA,
           CPCS_LP,
           CPCS_UU
           )

   The DATA parameter specifies the AAL5 data to be transferred.  The
   CPCS_LP parameter specifies the value of the CLP field in the ATM
   cell.  The CPCS_UU parameter specifies the user-to-user data to be
   transferred.

4.2.2.2 AAL5_UNITDATA.ind

   The AAL5_UNITDATA.ind indicates an AAL5 data (AAL5 CPCS_SDU) delivery
   from the AAL5 layer entity to the ST2+ data layer entity.  The
   semantics of the primitive are as follows:

   AAL5_UNITDATA.ind (
           DATA,
           CPCS_LP,
           CPCS_UU,
           STATUS [optional]
           )

   The DATA parameter indicates the delivered AAL5 data.  The CPCS_LP
   parameter indicates the value of the CLP field in the ATM cell.  The
   CPCS_UU parameter indicates the delivered user-to-user data.  The
   STATUS parameter indicates whether the delivered AAL5 data is corrupt
   or not.  The STATUS parameter is an optional parameter, and valid
   only when the corrupted SDU delivery option is selected.


4.3 AAL5 Encapsulation for ST2+ Data PDU

4.3.1 Mapping from st2_unitdata.req to AAL5_UNITDATA.req

   The ST2+ Data PDU is directly assigned to the DATA parameter in
   AAL5_UNITDATA.req.  That is, as shown in Fig. 4.1, the ST2+ Data PDU
   is mapped to the payload of AAL5 CPCS_PDU.

         Fig. 4.1: Mapping of ST2+ data to AAL5 CPCS_PDU payload.

   The value of CPCS_LP in AAL5_UNITDATA.req depends on the
   implementation: 1 (low priority) or zero (high priority) may be
   assigned permanently, or they may be assigned depending on the value
   of pri in st2_unitdata.req.

   The value of the CPCS_UU indication field in AAL5_UNITDATA.req is set
   to zero.

4.3.2 Mapping from AAL5_UNITDATA.ind to st2p_unitdata.ind

   The DATA parameter in AL5_UNITDATA.ind is directly assigned to the
   ST2+ Data PDU.  That is, the payload in AAL5 CPCS_PDU is mapped to
   the ST2+ Data PDU.

   If the value of STATUS in AAL5_UNITDATA.ind is valid, it is assigned
   to the status in st2p_unitdata.ind.

4.3.3 Value of MTU

   The value of MTU is Maximum CPCS_SDU size.


4.4 Service Primitives Provided by AAL1

4.4.1 Requirements for AAL1

   The requirements for the AAL1 layer on the ST2+ over ATM user plane
   are as follows:

   o The CS must support the synchronous circuit transport function
     described in ITU-T Recommendation I.231. The others CS functions
     need not be supported.

   o Structured data transfer and forward error correction need not be
     supported.

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


   o The CBR rate is N * 64 Kbit/s, where N is between 1 and 65,535.

     Note: It is recommended to support 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,
     15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360 as
     values of N.

4.4.2 Overview of interactions

   The AAL1 layer entity on the ST2+ over ATM user plane provides the
   following services to the ST2+ data layer.

   o AAL1_UNITDATA.req

   o AAL1_UNITDATA.ind

4.4.2.1 AAL1_UNITDATA.req

   The AAL1_UNITDATA.req primitive sends a request for an AAL1 data
   transfer from the ST2+ data layer entity to the AAL1 layer entity.
   The semantics of the primitive are as follows:

   AAL1_UNITDATA.req (
           DATA,
           CLP
           )

   The DATA parameter specifies the AAL1 data to be transferred.  The
   CLP parameter specifies the value of the CLP field in the ATM cell.

4.4.2.2 AAL1_UNITDATA.ind

   The AAL1_UNITDATA.ind indicates an AAL1 Data delivery from the AAL1
   layer entity to the ST2+ data layer entity.  The semantics of the
   primitive are as follows:

   AAL1_UNITDATA.ind (
           DATA,
           CLP,
           STATUS [optional]
           )

   The DATA parameter indicates the delivered AAL1 data.  The CLP
   parameter indicates the value of the CLP field in the ATM cell.  The
   STATUS parameter is an optional parameter that indicates whether the
   delivered AAL1 data is corrupt or not.

4.5 AAL1 Encapsulation for ST2+ Data PDU

4.5.1 Mapping from st2_unitdata.req to AAL1_UNITDATA.req

   The data in st2_unitdata.req is regarded as a sequential-byte stream;
   every 47 bytes of the data are assigned to the DATA parameter in
   AAL1_UNITDATA.req.  That is, as shown in Fig. 4.2, every 47 bytes of
   the ST2+ data in the ST2+ Data PDU are continuously mapped to the
   payload of AAL1 SAR_PDU.

   Therefore, one st2_unitdata.req corresponds to one or more than one
   AAL1_UNITDATA.req, and one AAL1_UNITDATA.req may correspond to more
   than one st2p_unitdata.req.

   +-------+-----------+  +-------+-----------+

          Fig. 4.2: Mapping of ST2+ data to AAL1 SAR_PDU payload.

   The value of the CLP in AAL1_UNITDATA.req depends on the
   implementation: 1 (low priority) or zero (high priority) may be
   assigned permanently, or they may be assigned depending on the value
   of pri in st2_unitdata.req.

4.5.2 Mapping from AAL1_UNITDATA.ind to st2p_unitdata.ind

   The DATA parameter in AAL1_UNITDATA.ind is regarded as a sequential-
   byte stream. A certain number of bytes, where the number is equal to
   or less than the negotiated downstream MTU value, are assigned to the
   data in st2p_unitdata.ind.  That is, as shown in Fig. 4.2, some bytes
   of the payload in AAL1 SAR_PDU are mapped to the ST2+ data in the
   ST2+ Data PDU.

   Therefore, one st2_unitdata.ind corresponds to one or more than one
   AAL1_UNITDATA.ind, and one AAL1_UNITDATA.ind may correspond to more
   than one st2p_unitdata.ind.

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


   An implementation-dependent value is assigned to pri in
   st2p_unitdata.ind.

   If the value of STATUS in AAL1_UNITDATA.ind is valid, it is assigned
   to the status in st2p_unitdata.ind.

4.5.3 Value of MTU

   Because AAL1 is not designed to directly support packet
   communications and thus has no MTU, the value of MTU is
   implementation-dependent and equal to or less than 65,535 bytes.  The
   value of MTU may be determined by the rate of the VC, by the buffer
   length, or by the packet-processing rule.


5. Protocol Specification of the Management Plane

   TBD

   This section will be prepared based on the discussions of the ISSLL
   working group.

6. Protocol Specification of the Control Plane

   This section specifies the relationship between ST2+ SCMP and PVC
   management for ST2+ data, and the protocol interaction between ST2+
   SCMP and Q.2931 UNI signaling [5, 9].


6.1 AAL5 Encapsulation for ST2+ SCMP PDU

   This subsection describes AAL5 PDU encapsulation for the ST2+ SCMP
   PDU.  AAL5 encapsulation based on RFC 1483 and on the RFC 1483
   extension are specified.  Selection of which one to use depends on
   the implementation.

   The ST2+ over ATM protocol does not cover a VC (SVC/PVC) that
   transfers ST2+ SCMP. VCs for IPv4 transfer may be used for ST2+ SCMP
   transfer, and implementations may provide particular VCs for ST2+
   SCMP transfer. Selection of these VCs depends on the implementation.

6.1.1 RFC 1483 base encapsulation

   The RFC 1483 base encapsulation is shown in Fig. 6.1: the ST2+ SCMP
   PDU with the RFC 1483 LLC encapsulation for routed protocol format is
   mapped to the payload in AAL5 CPCS_PDU.  Implementors should note
   that this is not same as AAL5 encapsulation for the ST2+ Data PDU
   (the LLC is required).

               +------+----------------+
               |  ST  |   ST2+ SCMP    |               ST2+
               |header|                |               SCMP PDU

   |             payload               |   |trailer |  CPCS_PDU
   +---------------------------------------+--------+

       Fig. 6.1: Mapping of ST2+ SCMP PDU to AAL5 CPCS_PDU payload.

   The value of the LLC is 0xAA-AA-03, the value of the OUI is 0x00-00-
   00, and the value of the PID is 0x08-00.  The classification of the
   IPv4 and the ST2+ SCMP is determined by the IP version number, which
   is located in the first four bits of the IPv4 or ST headers.

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-suzuki-st2-over-atm-01.txt         March, 1997


6.1.2 RFC 1483 extension base encapsulation

   The RFC 1483 extension base encapsulation is the same as for RFC 1483
   base encapsulation, except that the value of the OUI is 0x00-00-5E
   (IANA) and the value of the PID is 0xXX-XX (TBD).

   The RFC 1483 base encapsulation for the SCMP is ideal, but requires
   modifying the IPv4 processing in the driver software of the WS or PC.
   Therefore, the RFC 1483 base encapsulation may be difficult to
   implement.  This encapsulation is designed to solve this problem.



The following subsections will be added in the next draft.

6.2 Service Primitives Provided by Control Plane

6.3 Service Primitives Provided by ST2+ SCMP

6.4 Service Primitives Provided by Q.2931

6.5 CONNECT Processing

6.6 CHANGE Processing

6.7 DISCONNECT Processing

6.8 REFUSE Processing

6.9 Q.2931 Information Element Coding

6.10 State Transit of ST2+ SCMP Entity
