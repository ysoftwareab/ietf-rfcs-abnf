   switches employing the VLAN Cross Connect method use the link local
   labels defined in the GELS framework document to establish Connection
   Oriented point-to-point Ethernet services.  An additional document

1.  Terminology

   The following terminology is introduced in addition to the
   terminology defined in the framework.

   VLAN Cross Connect: A method for providing Connection Oriented
   Ethernet.  Using this method, frames are forwarded according to the
   ingress port on which they enter a network element and the VLAN
   Identifier(s) that appears in the frame.

   VXC Connection: An end-to-end Ethernet connection created by the VLAN
   Cross Connect method.

   VLAN-XC: A virtual channel that cross connects ingress and egress
   points of an Ethernet VLAN-XC network element.

   VLAN-XC Domain: The partition of the Ethernet provider network that
   provides the VLAN Cross Connect.

   Selector ID: The VID field of the outer 802.1Q tag of the Ethernet
   frame.

   VXC-Identifier: An identifier of the VLAN-XC.  This is a 12-bit or
   24-bit identifier, depending on the value of the Selector ID.

   VXC-TAG: VLAN Cross Connect TAG, the 802.1Q Tag, identifying the VXC
   Connection.  The VXC-Identifier is the standard 12-bit VID field of
   the tag.

   EVXC-TAG: Extended VLAN Cross Connect Tag: Double 802.1Q tags
   concatenating the standard outer VLAN tag and the standard subsequent
   inner VLAN tag.  The Extended VLAN-XC Identifier is the concatenation
   of the 12-bit VID of the outer VLAN tag and the 12-bit VID of the
   subsequent inner VLAN tag.  Combined, they create a 24-bit wide VXC-
   Identifier.

   Provider Edge Node: An Ethernet network element at the edge of the
   VLAN-XC Domain creating and terminating VLAN-XC connections.

   Provider Node: An Ethernet network element within the VLAN-XC Domain
   that performs the VLAN cross-connect function.

2.  Introduction

   Ethernet has become widely used within Service Provider networks.
   With the evolution from LAN Ethernet to Carrier Ethernet through the
   addition of new mechanisms like VLAN stacking (IEEE802.1ad), OAM
   (Y.1731, IEEE802.1ag) and MAC stacking (IEEE802.1ah), Ethernet now
   provides the carrier market with high-speed interfaces, cost-saving
   efficiency and flexibility, in addition to a reduction in CAPEX.
   This evolution, however, preserves the basic characteristics of
   Ethernet switching (e.g.  MAC learning and forwarding, xSTP, etc.)
   and the connectionless nature of Ethernet, and does not properly
   address the increasing demand of Service Providers for scalability,
   fast recovery time, Traffic Engineering and guaranteed end-to-end QoS
   for different service requirements.

   For point-to-point and point-to-multipoint services, MAC address
   learning is not required, as frames do not have to be directed to
   different outputs based on their MAC address.  They are all sent to
   the same output ports.  The IEEE802 has recognized this and the
   latest IEEE802.1q allows MAC address learning to be disabled for
   point-to-point VLANs in a bridge.  By removing the need for MAC
   address learning, the VLAN Cross Connect method resolves the MAC
   scalability issues associated with bridging networks.  In the VLAN
   Cross Connect method, the frames are forwarded according to the
   ingress port and the VXC-Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label) of the
   ingress frames, regardless of the MAC addresses.  The VXC-Identifiers
   (i.e.  Ethernet labels) are only significant on the local links,
   where they simplify the VLAN-XC domain-wide provisioning task and
   improve its scalability.  A maximum of 16 million services per port
   can be delivered using the VLAN Cross Connect method.

   The VLAN Cross Connect method supports end-to-end QoS and Traffic
   Engineering with guaranteed BW, and controlled jitter and delay.  The
   GMPLS control plane can be used to setup the end-to-end path
   throughout the network and to reserve the resources along the path
   appropriately.

   The VLAN Cross Connect method can provide high availability to ensure
   guaranteed services.  Through mechanisms like OAM, global/centralized
   and/or local/distributed protection mechanisms, the Ethernet network
   can provide failover times defined in tens of milliseconds that are
   needed to meet stringent SLA obligations.

   A sub-50ms recovery time can be enabled through the comprehensive set
   of GMPLS resiliency mechanisms, providing a solution to the
   convergence time issues of traditional Ethernet mechanisms (xSTP).

   The VLAN Cross Connect method resolves security issues.

   The VLAN Cross Connect method supports both uni-directional and bi-
   directional VXC connections.

   The VLAN Cross Connect method maintains the standard Ethernet frame
   (as defined in IEEE 802.1Q and IEEE 802.1ad).

   Bridging and VLAN Cross Connect can coexist on the same network
   infrastructure (even on the same port) to provide the most
   appropriate method for a particular service, depending on its
   specific requirements.  While the bridging method may be applied for
   residential multicast services and basic Ethernet transparent LAN
   services (e.g.  Business MPtMP VPN, IP TV, etc.), the VLAN Cross
   Connect method may be applied for business-critical services with
   associated SLAs, such as business and residential voice services,
   residential video-on-demand, etc.

   More detailed descriptions on the VLAN Cross Connect method can be
   found in [ITU-T VLAN Switching] and in [IEEE VLAN-XC].

3.  VLAN Cross Connect Functional Overview

   The VLAN Cross Connect method complies with the framework and
   architecture defined by the GELS framework for GMPLS-controlled
   Ethernet Label Switching.

   End-to-end VLAN-XC connectivity (i.e.  VXC Connection) may be
   established between two Ethernet label-controlled interfaces
   belonging to E-LERs.  These interfaces are capable of recognizing the
   Ethernet frame boundaries and can switch data based on the content of
   the standard IEEE 802.1 Ethernet frame.  End-to-end VLAN-XC
   connectivity originates on an ingress E-LER and terminates on an
   egress E-LER.  For point-to-point bi-directional VLAN-XC
   connectivity, the same pair of E-LERs acts as both ingress and egress
   E-LERs.

   The VLAN Cross Connect method makes use of two kinds of identifiers
   (i.e.  Ethernet labels), the 12-bit VLAN Cross Connect Identifier
   (VXC-Identifier) and the 24-bit Extended VLAN Cross Connect
   Identifier (EVXC-Identifier).

   When a frame/packet enters an ingress PE via a CE-PE interface, the
   PE processes the incoming traffic flow by performing a number of pre-
   processing operations on the frame.  The pre-processing operations
   may include, for example, VID translation, VID insertion/ stripping,
   etc.  These operations are beyond the scope of this specification.
   The pre-processed frame is then presented to the ingress E-LER
   function that (1) maps the incoming frame to a particular end-to-end
   VXC Connection (i.e.  Ethernet LSP) according to different criteria
   (such as the MAC address(es), the VID, the 1.Q priority, the standard
   5-tuple, etc.), and (2) adds an Ethernet (E)VXC-Identifier (i.e.
   Ethernet label) to the frame and forwards it via the appropriate
   label-controlled interface along the VXC Connection (Ethernet LSP).

   Throughout the provider Ethernet network, the frames are switched via
   the appropriate interface based on the ingress port and the (E)VXC-
   Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label), which is encoded in the standard
   IEEE 802.1 frame header.  The switching operation replaces the
   (E)VXC-Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label) before the frame is
   transmitted.  Hybrid switching may be supported to switch a VXC-
   tagged Ethernet frame to an Extended VXC-tagged Ethernet frame or
   vice versa.  Frames that are received with an unknown (E)VXC-
   Identifier are silently discarded.  The forwarding decision is based
   on the information residing in the forwarding table.  This table may
   be configured by the GMPLS control plane.

   The egress E-LER terminates the VXC Connection (i.e.  Ethernet LSP)
   by removing the (E)VXC-Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label) from



Sprecher, et al.       Expires September 17, 2006               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      GMPLS Control of VLAN-XC Switches         March 2006


   incoming frames.  The PE then performs post-processing operations on
   the incoming frame and forwards it on the appropriate CE-PE
   interface.  Post-processing may include, for example, VID
   translation, VID insertion/ stripping, etc.  These operations are
   beyond the scope of this specification.

3.1.  VLAN Cross Connect Frame Semantic

   The (E)VXC-Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label) is part of the Ethernet
   MAC frame header and has local port scope.  The same (E)VXC-
   Identifier value can be reused on different ports.  The coding of the
   (E)VXC-Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label) does not modify the format
   of the standard Ethernet frame, although it may add new semantics to
   one or more fields.  No modification is made to the layers over which
   the Ethernet payload may be transmitted.

   The (E)VXC-Identifiers (i.e.  Ethernet label) are assigned and
   interpreted locally and have local significance.  This does not
   preclude the assignment of the same (E)VXC-Identifier value (i.e.
   Ethernet label) by consecutive hops.  The (E)VXC-Identifiers (i.e.
   Ethernet labels) are extensible for the establishment and the support
   of VXC Connections (i.e.  Ethernet LSPs) over multiple domains and
   for the support of point-to-multipoint VXC Connections (i.e. point-
   to-multipoint Ethernet LSPs) to carry Ethernet multicast traffic.
   These natural extensions will be described in a complementary
   document.

3.2.  (E)VXC-Identifiers

   As described above, two kinds of identifiers are supported by the
   VLAN Cross Connect method: (1) the 12-bit VXC-Identifier which
   enables the support of up to 4k VLAN-XCs per interface, and (2) the
   24-bit Extended VXC-Identifier (EVXC-Identifier) which enables the
   support of 16M VLAN-XCs per interface.

   For hybrid switching, the provider internal switches (i.e.  E-LSRs)
   can switch VXC tagged Ethernet frames by replacing the VXC identifier
   with the Extended VXC (EVXC) identifier and vice versa.

3.2.1.  VXC-Identifier

   The IEEE 802.1ad S-VID, defined in the amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q-
   1998, is used as the VXC-Identifier.

   Figure 1 depicts the format of the standard IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet
   frame which is referred to as a 'VXC Tagged Frame' by the VLAN Cross
   Connect method.

   TPID:  The TAG protocol Identifier (TPID) is a 16-bit length field
      which is defined with a value of 0x88A8 to identify the frame as
      an IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame.

   TCI:  The S-VID encoded in the TAG Control Information (TCI) field of
      the S-TAG is used as the VXC-Identifier (as depicted in Figure 2).
      The length of the VXC Identifier is 12 bits, providing for a space
      of 4k VLAN-XCs per link.

   PCP:  The Priority Code Point (PCP) is a 3-bit length field which is
      used to convey priority and drop eligibility parameters.  This
      3-bit field refers to 802.1p priority.

   D:  The D bit (1 bit) is the Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) bit.

   S_VID:  The S_VLAN Identifier (VID) is a 12-bit length field uniquely
      identifying the VLAN to which the frame belongs.  In the VLAN
      Cross Connect method, it encodes the VXC-Identifier.  Its value
      can be between 0 and 4,095.

   The S-VID translation mechanism (defined by the IEEE 802.1ad) is used
   for the switching operation.  MAC address learning and flooding
   should be inhibited (as supported the IEEE802.1q for point-to-point
   VLANs in a bridge).

   GMPLS may be used to configure the 12-bit VXC-Identifier (i.e.
   Ethernet label).

3.2.2.  Extended VXC Identifier

   In cases where the 4K link local identifier space is too small, an
   Extended VXC Identifier (EVXC-Identifier) can be used.  The Extended
   VXC Identifier is created by the concatenation of the S-VID (i.e. the
   VID of the S-TAG) and the C-VID (i.e. the VID of the C-TAG), thus
   providing a 24-bit length identifier.

   This technique makes use of the standard IEEE 802.1ad Stacked VLAN
   (QinQ) frame.  Figure 3 depicts the format of the IEEE 802.1ad
   Ethernet frame with Stacked VLAN (QinQ).

   +---------+----------+----+----+----+----+----+--------------+------+

         Figure 3: Standard IEEE 802.1ad Format with Stacked VLAN.

   This technique makes use of VID translation, as currently discussed
   in the IEEE 802.1.  Neither MAC-learning nor flooding for the range
   of VIDs are required.  GMPLS may be used to configure the 24-bit
   EVXC-Identifier (i.e.  Ethernet label).

3.3.  Ethernet Services

   End-to-end VLAN-XC connectivity can be used to provide any service
   that is supported by standard Ethernet.  These services are mapped in
   the Provider Edge Nodes (i.e. the E-LERs) to an appropriate VXC
   Connection.  The Ethernet frame is extended with the (E)VXC-TAG when
   it is sent over the VXC Connection.  The original client VLAN TAG
   (i.e. the CE-TAG) may, as an option, be transmitted transparently
   over the VXC Connection (i.e. preserved over the network), depending
   on the service definition.  A single VXC connection may support a set
   of customer VLANs (bundling).  All the various service mappings
   defined in ITU-T G.8011 can be supported.  The ITU-T definitions are
   aligned with the definitions of the MEF.

   A future work will be undertaken relating to the capability of the
   VLAN Cross Connect to enable Ethernet to provide a transport layer
   for multiple services, such as TDM, FR, etc.

4.  Interworking with Ethernet Legacy Bridging

   As specified above, hybrid Bridging and VLAN Cross Connect services
   can co-exist on the same provider network.  The hybrid network may
   contain both legacy bridges and hybrid (bridge and VLAN-XC) network
   elements.  While legacy bridges only handle bridge traffic, hybrid
   network elements may handle both bridge and VLAN-XC traffic.  The
   provider network can be optimized by applying the most appropriate
   method (VLAN Cross Connect or bridging) for a particular service,
   according to its specific requirements.

   The VLAN Cross Connect method may coexist with the standard bridging
   method on the same port on the node.  Based on the Selector ID value
   that appears in the Ethernet frame, the network elements determine
   whether the bridging or VLAN Cross Connect method should be applied
   to a frame.  Traffic segregation between VLAN Cross Connect and
   bridging is performed according to the characteristics and the
   requirements of the services that are to be provided.  Traffic
   segregation enables the advanced services offered by the VLAN Cross
   Connect method to be fully exploited while maintaining legacy
   bridging services.

4.1.  Method Selector

   The value of the VID field of the Ethernet frame's outer VLAN tag
   acts as the method selector (Selector ID).  Depending on the value of
   the VID, it is determined whether the bridging method should be
   applied to the frame (where switching is performed according to the
   MAC addresses and the VLANs), or whether the VLAN Cross Connect
   method should be applied (where switching is performed according to
   the ingress port and the (E)VXC-Identifier, regardless of the MAC
   addresses).

   Figure 4 illustrates the co-existence of both methods in hybrid
   networks.  The 'S' function depicted in the figure represents the
   method selector function.

             Figure 4: Hybrid Bridging and VLAN Cross Connect

   The address range of the outer VLAN tag, which is split between the
   switching and bridging ranges (e.g. 1-100 for VLAN Cross Connect and
   the remainder for bridging), should be configurable.  A future work
   will be undertaken to automate this configuration process and to
   extend the RSVP-TE protocol to include a 'Label Request with VLAN
   Label Range' Object.  This Object will specify the lower and the
   higher limits of a block of the identifiers that are supported on the
   originating switch.

   Note that when the Extended VXC Identifier is used for the VLAN Cross
   Connect, only a small address range belonging to the outer VLAN tag
   has to be assigned to the VLAN Cross Connect.  The available VLAN
   address range for bridging services is therefore hardly affected,
   while the VLAN Cross Connect can use the full address range of the
   inner tag.

4.2.  Hybrid Bridging and VLAN Cross Connect Networks

   A provider Ethernet network incorporating both the bridging and VLAN
   Cross Connect methods is better equipped to address some of the
   fundamental challenges of Ethernet provider networks than the
   standalone traditional bridging method.  The reasons for this are as
   follows:

   Ethernet Services: The VLAN Cross Connect method is applicable for
      both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint multicast services,
      while bridging can only be used for multipoint-to-multipoint
      services.

   Traffic Engineering: The VLAN Cross Connect method allows for full
      support of end-to-end Traffic Engineering.

   Fast Recovery: Following failure, The 'VLAN Cross Consent' services
      can be recovered in sub-50 ms.  When hybrid networks are used
      correctly, the Forwarding Database (FDB) remains small, resulting
      in improved recovery time for bridging services.

   MAC Scalability: When the VLAN Cross Connect method is applied for
      services that consume a large number of MAC addresses in hybrid
      networks, the FDB size (used for bridging services) is remains
      small due to the insignificance of MAC addresses in the VLAN Cross
      Connect method.

   VLAN Scalability: Unlike the bridging method in which VLAN
      identifiers have global scope, the identifiers in the VLAN Cross
      Connect method only have local port scope.  Correct segregation
      between the VLAN Cross Connect and bridging methods results in
      optimized VLAN scalability.

      While in the bridging method only the outer VLAN tag is
      significant, both the outer VLAN tag and the next VLAN tag could
      be significant in the VLAN Cross Connect method.

   User Isolation and Identification: In order to provide user isolation
      in pure bridge networks, an additional method should be applied,
      such as private VLAN or port isolation.  These mechanisms are,
      however, targeted at specific applications and do not provide
      general solutions.

      In the VLAN Cross Connect method, users are inherently isolated
      and identified by the end-to-end VXC connection.

   Security: The VLAN Cross Connect method does not rely on MAC
      addresses, and MAC address learning is inhibited.  Hence, the
      potential threats of MAC spoofing and MAC attacks are
      significantly reduced.  Bridging services should apply a MAC
      limiter per port or a VLAN to protect the network.

5.  Hierarchical Networks

   The VLAN Cross Connect method can be naturally extended to provide
   trunk services (e.g. for backbone applications).  The (E)VXC-TAGs can
   be stacked to create hierarchical VLAN Cross Connect Domains.  Figure
   5 depicts how the Level N+1 domain can provide tunnelling transport
   for VXC connections between two level N clouds.  This will be
   described in a future document.

6.  Control Plane

   As defined in the 'GELS framework for a GMPLS-enabled Ethernet
   network', the GMPLS control plane can be used to enable fast, dynamic
   and reliable VLAN-XC service provisioning in multi-vendor and multi-
   domain environments.  See the 'GELS framework' for details of the
   control plane elements and operations.

7.  OAM

   Robustness is enhanced with the addition of OAM in the data plane to
   provide both fault and performance management.  The OAM functions and
   frames defined in Y.1731 and in IEEE 802.1ag can be used.

8.  VLAN Cross Connect Network Resiliency

   Network resiliency is the network's ability to restore traffic
   following failure or attack, and is a critical factor in delivering
   reliable services.  Guaranteed service in the form of Service Level
   Agreements (SLAs) requires a resilient network that instantaneously
   detects facility or node failures and immediately restores network
   operations to meet the terms of the SLA.

   Through mechanisms such as pre-provisioned, end-to-end backup VXC
   Connections and fast failure detection using OAM mechanisms, the
   provider Ethernet network can match the sub-50 ms failover times
   required to maintain time-bounded services, even when thousands of
   services are simultaneously affected by a failure.

   Using an end-to-end alternative path, an Ethernet VXC Connection is
   protected between the ingress Provider Edge node and the egress
   Provider Edge node over the Ethernet domain.  When a failure occurs,
   data traffic is switched in the ingress Provider Edge node from the
   failed VXC Connection to its backup VXC Connection.  The backup VXC
   Connection is provisioned in advance to protect the primary VXC
   Connection and is ready for immediate use (1:1 hot standby).  When
   the protected XVC Connection cannot be sustained, the ingress
   Provider Edge node switches the data traffic from the failed VXC
   Connection to the pre-provisioned backup VXC Connection.

   In order to guarantee in advance that the backup VXC Connection would
   be able to protect a VXC Connection, both protected and backup VXC
   Connections have to be totally separate from one another, meaning
   that they have to be conducted through geographically diverse network
   elements (without sharing any resources).  This can be accomplished
   using the GMPLS control plane or via a domain-wide provisioning tool.

   The resources of the backup VXC Connection may be used by low-
   priority traffic which can be discarded when the protected VXC
   Connection fails (1:1 hot standby with extra traffic).

   Revertive and non-revertive switching modes are supported.  In
   revertive operation, traffic is restored to the primary VXC
   Connection after the problem causing the switchover has been cleared.
   It is recommended that the revertive mode be used when the path of
   the backup VXC Connection is of inferior quality, or when extra
   traffic is carried on the backup VXC Connection, so that traffic can
   be restored when the problem causing the switchover has been
   resolved.

   In addition, it should be possible to use the GMPLS re-routing
   mechanisms to recover VLAN-XC Connections (i.e.  Ethernet LSPs),

9.  Security Considerations

   MAC spoofing and MAC attacks are inherently eliminated in the VLAN
   Cross Connect method due to the insignificance of MAC addresses and
   the inhibition of the MAC learning process.

   For a description of other relevant issues, see the section on the
   'Security Considerations' in [GELS-FRAMEWORK].
