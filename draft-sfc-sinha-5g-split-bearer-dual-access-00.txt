                5G System Split Bearer for Dual-Access 
              draft-sfc-sinha-5g-split-bearer-dual-access-00

	
Abstract

   This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be
   developed for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of
   user's data in a scenario of dual-access outlining the poor radio
   coverage issues. This document also outlines the faster user data
   mechanisum accompanying dual access capabilities of 5G user device 
   via split bearer in case of a poor coverage.

1. Introduction

   5G system has been evolved to serve the user in more efficient way of
   meeting higher download and upload of user data, 5G Users accessing
   the network via wireline and wireless, in addition to this
   Residential Gateway RG and IoT support is also defined. Access and 
   user experience is challenging for poor radio coverage (for both 
   wi-fi and RAN) and the proposal in this document addresses the
   problem of poor coverage on either 3GPP or non-3GPP access with UE in
   dual-access mode.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   statement

3.1 5G System Architecture
   
   A simplified 5G System architecture shown in Figure-1 in the case of 
   UE in non-roaming scenario with RAN access(3GPP).

   User data of 5G system is delivered to user from Service or data
   network via interface N6 and N3 to UE.

3.2 QoS
 
   QFI is defined as Qos Flow ID is a identity to QoS flow in the 5G 
   system. All data traffic within a PDU session are each labelled or 
   identified by QFI, implies same QFI labelled data flow will receives
   same traffic forwarding treatment like scheduling, priority, etc.

   QoS /Data flow is via N3(and N3 and N9) interface, being encapsulated
   end-to-end. This flow is controlled by SMF, who provides QoS profile 
   during session establishment to R(AN) and provide the PDR to the UPF.

   Please Note that like 4G system, default QoS flow is applied to each 
   PDU session and retain till lifetime span of connectivity. In case 
   of non-3GPP access QFI is delivered to N3IWF entity (or NG-RAN) for 
   every time User Plane of the PDU session is established, modified or
   activated.

3.3 Dual Connectivity

   Dual connectivity (DC) functionality support the network to make use
   of additional radio resource to achieve required throughput in
   downlink and uplink of user data. This was introduced in 4G system
   support 5G data speed by addition of dual connectivity of UE with
   eNBs, master eNB and secondary eNB and /or eNodeB in congestion with
   gNB. This is achieved by addition of secondary eNodeB to the Master
   eNodeB. Master eNB has full control to add, delete and HO(handover)
   of eNodeBs as and when needed.[20160157293]

3.4 Problem Statement

   Problem statement: Inspite of dual access 5G users radio condition 
   capabilities degrade on either of the access types and the
   associated user experience on that access type becomes a challenge.

4. Proposal of Split Bearer for dual access 

   The solution proposed in this document to solve the problem of 
   degrade radio condition on the either of the access type at UE and 
   bearer offloading to other access-type. 

   Bearer split among RAN and Wifi referring to Fig-4. Trigger for split
   bearer of bearer can originate from other of access type RAN or wifi.

   - In the example given in figure-4 there is a degrade in radio 
     condition at RAN access of user. And at the same time 5G user also
     have wi-fi access registered. 

   - Based on measurement report from UE, gNB (RAN) take decision for
     partial Handover. gNB asked for UECapabilitys to check availability
     of other access type.

   - Taking inputs on UECapabilities response about the availability of
     other access type, gNB process for Split bearer with other access
     type

   - gNB(RAN) triggers split bearer request for Wi-Fi access to AMF
     and also includes user data traffic template FILTER.

   FILTER:
     FILTER is a user data delivery template defined by NG-RAN for the
     5G-core UPF to implement and execute, without super imposing on the
     PCC rule. 

   - If offload of complete user data traffic is needed, then FILTER
      value MUST be empty/NULL.

5. IANA Considerations

   None.

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations related to the 5G systems are discussed in
   [NGMN].  Due to the request for intrinsic realization of security
   such aspects have to be considered by design for architecture and
   protocols.

   Especially as a joint usage of resources and network functions by
   different separate logical network slices (e.g. in terms of virtual
   network functions) seems to be inevitable in the framework of 5G the
   need for strong security measures in such an environment is a major
   challenge.

7. Privacy Considerations

   Support of full privacy of the users (customers and tenants / end
   service providers) is a basic feature of the next generation trusted
   and reliable communications offering system.  Such a high degree of
   ensured privacy shall be reflected in the proposed architecture and
   protocol solutions.

   Especially as Identifiers and mapping of locators to them are
   addressed some privacy concerns arise.  Mobility solutions tend to
   expose unique identifiers.  A solution inside the mobile network
   exposes these identifiers to the network operator, which is not a big
   deal since the network operator already has information about the
   device's location.  In contrast, an IP level solution exposes both
   the identifiers and the locations at the IP layer.  That means that
   web sites, for example, can now track the device's successive
   locations by watching the IP address.  Solutions such as transporting
   the identifiers not as part of the IP header should be considered.
