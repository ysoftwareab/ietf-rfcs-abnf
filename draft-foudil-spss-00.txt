               The Security Policy Specification Standard
                          draft-foudil-spss-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a way of standardising the structure,
   language, and grammar used in security policies.  The goal is to
   reduce ambiguity and confusion that stems from poorly-worded security
   policies.  Organisations and individuals can refer back to this
   document if their security policy uses definitions found in this
   document.

1.  The Specification

1.1.  Disclosure Policy

   The "Disclosure policy" refers to the section of the security policy
   where the vendor describes how someone can report a security issue.
   Vendors SHOULD use the SECURITY@domain email address for
   communications regarding security issues as per section 4 of
   [RFC2142] and set up a security.txt file pointing to the security
   policy as per [draft-foudil-securitytxt] [1].  This section also
   establishes a safe harbour where the vendor declares that they are
   ready to investigate legitimate reports and not take legal action
   against the reporter if the reporter abides by the vendor's security
   policy.

   Example

      You can report security vulnerabilities to security@example.com.
      We will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to
      quickly resolve any vulnerability.  To encourage reporting
      security vulnerabilities directly to us, we will not take legal
      action against you nor ask law enforcement to investigate you
      providing you comply with the following guideline:

      *  Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations,
         destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of my
         services.

1.2.  Service-level agreement (Performance expectations)

   Since the disclosure process should be coordinated, the security
   researcher will want to know what to expect from the vendor,
   especially when it comes to the duration of the entire disclosure
   process.  A service-level agreement SHOULD include the expected time
   to:

   o  First response

   o  Reward (If the vendor offers any rewards - see "Rewards" section)

   o  Resolution

   Example

      We will make a best effort to meet the following expectations for
      security researchers participating in this security program:



      *  Time to first response: 2 business days or less.

      *  Time to triage: 3 business days or less.

      *  Time to reward: 3 business days or less.

      *  Time to resolution: 30 business days or less.

1.3.  Scope

   This section will define the grammar to be used when defining a
   scope; this becomes especially useful when the vendor wants to
   encourage security researchers to inspect the security of a product
   and report by back with any findings.

   In scope

   The term "in scope" refers to any assets that belong to the vendor
   and are within the security policy's boundary.  Security researchers
   are instructed to look for security issues in in-scope assets.

   Out of scope

   "Out of scope" is the opposite of "in scope" and refers to any assets
   that do not belong to the vendor, and are not within the security
   policy's boundary.  Security researchers SHOULD not look for issues
   nor report security issues located in out-of-scope assets.

   Grammar

   To make things very clear to the security researcher it is important
   to have a clear and well-designed scope; one way of achieving this is
   to have a standardised and detailed language to describe the asset in
   question.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Symbol    | Definition                                            |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | "*"       | "All", as in any possible value.                      |
   |           |                                                       |
   | "[80,     | The set containing the values 80 and 443.             |
   | 443]"     |                                                       |
   |           |                                                       |
   | "[0-10]"  | A range. In this example a range from 0 to 10.        |
   |           |                                                       |
   | "+"       | In scope. This symbol can be substituted with simply  |
   |           | placing the definitions under an "In scope" section.  |
   |           |                                                       |
   | "- "      | Out of scope. This symbol can be substituted with     |
   |           | simply placing the definitions under an "Out of       |
   |           | scope" section.                                       |
   |           |                                                       |
   | "app:"    | This directive refers to a native application. This   |
   |           | allows one to link to a digital distribution service  |
   |           | and make it clear that the native application is what |
   |           | is being referred to and not the actual page where    |
   |           | you can download the native application.              |
   |           |                                                       |
   | "mailto:" | Refers to an email address as defined in [RFC6068]    |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

   Usage

   The symbols defined above can be used as follows:

   +-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+

1.4.  Exclusions

1.4.1.  Excluded test types

   Excluded test types define what methods for discovering security
   issues a security researcher is not permitted to use.

   Example

      Findings from physical testing such as office access are strictly
      prohibited.

1.4.2.  Excluded issue types

   Excluded issue types are types of security issues that the vendor
   does not want security researchers to report.  To prevent confusion
   the vendor SHOULD structure each exclusion in this section as a
   description of the issue type followed by the reason why the vendor
   does not want to receive reports concerning that type of issue.

   Example

      We do not want researchers to report Cross-site Request Forgery
      (CSRF) with minimal security implications such as logout CSRF to
      us.  In order for CSRF to be a valid issue, it must affect some
      important action such as deleting one's account.

1.5.  Proof of concepts

   The "Proof of concepts" section describes what the vendor wants the
   security researcher to demonstrate in their proof of concept.  This
   section should also set boundaries to ensure that the security
   researchers know how far they have to escalate their finding to
   demonstrate the issue.

   Example

   Google's Vulnerability Reward Program states the following [2]:

      [...] while alert(1) is the standard way of confirming that your
      attempt to inject JavaScript code into a web application succeeded
      in some way, it does not tell you where that injection happened,
      exactly.  That's particularly important for Google services
      because of our use of sandboxed domains to safely render some of
      the content we get from our users or retrieve from the Internet.
      So, we always recommend our reporters to try
      alert(document.domain) instead.

   Encouraging security researchers to use alert(document.domain) in
   their proof of concept allows Google and the security researcher to
   quickly determine if the finding is a valid issue.

1.6.  Terminology

   The term "severity" is frequently used interchangeably with "impact"
   or "priority".  This section defines some basic terminology in order
   to prevent any potential confusion.

   Severity (Oxford Dictionaries' definition [3])

      The fact or condition of being severe.

   Overall severity

      The overall score determined using a vulnerability scoring system
      such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [4].

   Impact (Information Technology Infrastructure Library's definition
   [5])

      A measure of the effect of an incident, problem or change on
      business processes.  Impact is often based on how service levels
      will be affected.  Impact and urgency are used to assign priority.

   Priority (Information Technology Infrastructure Library's definition
   [6])

      A category used to identify the relative importance of an
      incident, problem or change.  Priority is based on impact and
      urgency, and is used to identify required times for actions to be
      taken.

1.7.  Rewards

   Some vendors reward security researchers for reporting security
   issues either in form of a public acknowledgment, prizes -- often
   referred to as "swag" -- and/or payments, so called "bounties".
   Financial rewards (bounties) SHOULD be tied to the overall severity
   of the reported security issue and not the security issue type.

   Example

   This is an example reward table where the bounty amounts are tied to
   overall severity scores calculated using the Common Vulnerability
   Scoring System.

2.  Security considerations

   Organizations creating a security policy will need to consider
   several security-related issues.  These include exposure to sensitive
   information and attacks where limited access to a server could grant
   the ability to modify the contents of the policy or affect how it is
   served.
