               1 Introduction 
                   
                  ISO/IEC 14496 is a standard designed for the representation and 
                  delivery of multimedia information over a variety of transport 
                  protocols.  It includes interactive scene management, visual and 
                  audio representations as well as systems functionality like 
                  multiplexing, synchronization, and an object descriptor framework.  
                   
                  This document provides a framework for the carriage of ISO/IEC14496 
                  contents over IP networks and guidelines for designing payload format 
                  specifications for the detailed mapping of ISO/IEC 14496 content into 
                  several IP-based protocols

               2 Use of RTP 
                   
                  There are a number of RTP packetization schemes for ISO/IEC 14496 
                  data[5] [6] [9]. Media-aware packetization (e.g. video frames split 
                  at recoverable sub-frame boundaries) is a principle in RTP, and thus 
                  it is likely that several RTP schemes will be needed, to suit both 
                  the different kinds of media - audio, video, etc. - and different 
                  encodings (e.g. AAC and CELP audio codecs) [8].This specification 
                  does not specify any payload format but do specify a general 
                  framework to design and utilize the payload formats in appropriate 
                  way. 
                   
                  This specification requires that, no matter what packetization scheme 
                  is used, there are a number of common characteristics that all MUST 

                 
               Singer & Lim      Informational – Expires Jan. 2002                 2 
                               A Framework for the delivery of MPEG-4       July 2001 
                
                
                  have: however, such characteristics depend on the fact that the RTP 
                  Session contains a single elementary stream or a flexmux stream. 
                   
                  In case an RTP Session contains a single elementary stream the 
                  following characteristics apply: 
                   
                  2.1]  The RTP timestamp corresponds to the presentation time (e.g. 
                  CTS) of the earliest AU within the packet. 
                   
                  2.2]  RTP packets have sequence numbers in transmission order. The 
                  payloads logically or physically have SL Sequence numbers, which are 
                  in decoding order, for each elementary stream. 
                   
                  2.3]  The ISO/IEC 14496 timescale (clock ticks per second), which is 
                  timeStampResolution in the case of ISO/IEC 14496 Systems, MUST be 
                  used as the RTP timescale, e.g. as declared in SDP for an RTP stream. 
                   
                  2.4]  To achieve a base level of interoperability, and to ensure that 
                  any ISO/IEC 14496 stream may be carried, all senders and receivers 
                  MUST implement a default RTP payload mapping scheme. It is highly 
                  desirable that this default scheme is common for both pure Audio and 
                  Visual streams as well as for SL Packetized streams. This default 
                  scheme is not yet identified. 
                   
                  2.5]  Streams SHOULD be synchronized using RTP techniques (notable 
                  RTCP sender reports).  When the ISO/IEC 14496 OCR is used, it is 
                  logically mapped to the NTP time axis used in RTCP. 
                   
                  2.6]  The RTP packetization schemes may be used for ISO/IEC 14496 
                  elementary streams 'standing alone' (e.g. without ISO/IEC 14496 
                  systems, including BIFS);  or they may be used within an overall 
                  presentation using the object descriptor framework.  In the latter 
                  case, an SLConfigDescriptor is sent describing the stream.  Logically, 
                  each RTP stream is passed through a mapping function which is 
                  specific to the payload format used;  this mapping function yields an 
                  SL packetized stream.  The SLConfigDescriptor describes this logical 
                  stream, not the actual bits in the RTP payload.  For example, the RTP 
                  sequence number may be used to make the SLPacketHeader sequence 
                  number;  other SL fields may be set in this way, dynamically, or from 
                  static values in the payload specification. For example, as all RTP 
                  packets carry a composition time-stamp, the flag in the SL header 
                  indicating its presence can normally be statically defined as 'true'.  
                  Each payload format for ISO/IEC 14496 content MUST specify the 
                  mapping function for the formation of the SLConfigDescriptor and the 
                  SLPacketHeader. 
                   
                  In the case of RFC 3016, the mapping will be defined in a new section.

                  In case an RTP Session contains a flexmultiplexed stream the 
                  following characteristics apply: 
                   
                  2.7]  There is a single payload format for the carriage of Flexmux 
                  Streams over RTP [5].  Senders and receivers MAY implement this 
                  scheme. 
                   
                  2.8]  The RTP timestamp corresponds to the FCR if present at the 
                  Flexmux level. 
                   
                  2.9]  The ISO/IEC 14496 Flexmux timescale (FCR resolution in  ticks 
                  per second) SHOULD be used as the RTP timescale (as can be declared 
                  in SDP). 
                   
                  2.10] the ISO/IEC 14496 FCR is logically mapped to the NTP time axis 
                  used in RTCP. 
                   
                  Other payload formats MAY be used.  They are signalled as dynamic 
                  payload IDs, defined by a suitable name (e.g. a payload name in an 
                  SDP RTPMAP attribute).  In particular, the development of specialized 
                  RTP payloads for video (e.g. respecting video packets) and audio (e.g. 
                  providing interleave) is expected.  It is possible that these schemes 
                  can be compatible with the default scheme required here. 
                   
                  There may be a choice of RTP payload formats for a given stream (e.g. 
                  as an elementary stream, an SL-packetized stream, using FlexMux, and 
                  so on).  It is recommended that 
                  ·    terminals implementing a given sub-system (e.g. video) accept at 
                  least an ES and the default SL packings of that stream;  for example, 
                  this means accepting the draft by RFC 3016. and also the generic 
                  payload format for ISO/IEC 14496 Visual;

                  ·    terminals implementing a given payload format accept any stream 
                  over that format for which they have a decoder, even if that packing 
                  is not normally the 'best' packing. 
                   
                  Future versions of this specification will identify the single 
                  standard RTP packing format for each ISO/IEC 14496 stream type.  
                  However, at the time of writing the RTP payload format specifications 
                  are still being defined, and the set is incomplete.  These 
                  recommendations will form the basis for improved interoperability. 
                   
                  For those streams requiring a certain Quality of Service (specifiable 
                  appropriately) , the recommendation is to further investigate 
                  possible solutions such as the leverage of existing work in the IETF 
                  in this area (including, but not limited to FEC, re-transmission, or 
                  repetition). However, techniques in data-dependent error correction, 
                  or combined source/channel coding solutions make other schemes 
                  attractive. Also, it is recommended that requirement such as 
                  efficient grouping mechanisms (i.e. the ability to send in a single 
                  RTP packet multiple consecutive Aus, each with its own SL 
                  information) and low overhead are also taken into account. 
                   
                   
                   
                   
               3 SDP Information 
                   
                  This specification considers only ISO/IEC 14496 Systems related 
                  issues. Usage of SDP information for specific payload format shall be 
                  specified in each RTP payload format RFCs. The usage of elementary 
                  streams in other contexts is not addressed here: codepoints for this 
                  case are specified in [6], and in other places. 
                   
                  This specification currently assumes that any session described by 
                  SDP (e.g. in SAP, as a file download, as a DESCRIBE over RTSP) has at 
                  most one ISO/IEC 14496 session.  It is desirable that this 
                  restriction be lifted. 
                   
                  3.1] Senders SHOULD alert receivers that an ISO/IEC 14496 session is 
                  included, by means of an SDP attribute that is general (i.e. before 
                  any "media" lines).  This takes the form of an attribute line: 
                   
                  a=mpeg4-iod:[<location>] 
                   
                  location:  In an RTSP session, this is an optional attribute. If not 
                  supplied, the IOD is retrieved over the RTSP session by using 
                  DESCRIBE with an accept of type application/mpeg4-iod. Where the SDP 
                  information is supplied by some other means (e.g. as a file, in SAP), 
                  the location is obligatory. The location should be a URL enclosed in 
                  double-quotes, which will supply the IOD (e.g. small ones may be 
                  encoded using "data:", otherwise "http:" or other suitable file-
                  access URL). The InitialObjectDescriptor is defined in sub-clause 
                  8.6.3.1 of ISO/IEC 14496-1.

                  or: 
                   
                  a=mpeg4-iod-xmt:[<location>] 
                   
                  location: In an RTSP session, this is an optional attribute. If not 
                  supplied, the IOD is retrieved over the RTSP session by using 
                  DESCRIBE with an accept of type application/mpeg4-iod-xmt. Where the 
                  SDP information is supplied by some other means (e.g. as a file, in 
                  SAP), the location is obligatory. The location shall be a URL 
                  enclosed in double-quotes, which will supply the IOD in XMT format 
                  (e.g. small ones may be encoded using "data:", otherwise "http:" or 
                  other suitable file-access URL). The InitialObjectDescriptor is 
                  defined in sub-clause 8.6.3.1 of ISO/IEC 14496-1, and its XMT format 
                  is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-1 2001 PDAM 2.   
                   
                  Any receivers using IOD shall understand binary IOD and may 
                  understand textual IOD. 
                   
                  3.2] New encoding names for the a = rtpmap attribute It is 
                  recommended that, no matter what payload format is used, each media 
                  stream be placed in a media section that is appropriate.  For example, 
                  a payload format which can carry both video and audio streams may be 
                  used in sections of SDP starting both with "m=video" and "m=audio".  
                  The MIME name for the payload format is thus registered under all 
                  applicable branches. 
                   
                  a = rtpmap:<payload> <name>/<time scale>/<parameters> 
                   
                  payload is the dynamic payload number  
                  The <name> is defined and documented in the IETF specification for 
                  the payload forma 
                  time scale is the time scale of the RTP time stamps 
                  parameters if used, is defined in the RTP payload format 
                   
                  3.3] The mapping of RTP streams to elementary streams needs to cover 
                  the Flexmux case as well as the single stream.  Within the SDP 
                  information, a stream-specific attribute SHOULD be present for each 
                  ISO/IEC 14496 stream.  It takes one of two forms, depending on 
                  whether a single elementary stream, or a flexmux, is carried. 
                   
                  3.4] In case of a single elementary stream, the following attribute 
                  is defined: 
                   
                  a=mpeg4-esid:a 
                   
                  a is the ESID. 
                   
                  3.5] Other SDP attributes should, if used, carry values consistent 
                  with those carried in ISO/IEC 14496 systems (for example, bit rate).

               4 MIME Types 
                   
                  4.1] The historical approach for MPEG data is to declare it under 
                  "video", and this approach is followed for ISO/IEC 14496.  For 
                  presentations with audio information and no visual aspect, the 
                  "audio" top-level mime type may be used;  otherwise, "video" is used. 
                   
                  4.2] Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known as version 
                  2) includes a standard file type for encapsulating ISO/IEC 14496 data.  
                  This file type can be used in a number of ways: perhaps the most 
                  important are its use as an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 data, 
                  its use as a content-download format, and as the format read by 
                  streaming media servers. 
                   
                  These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a 
                  standard MIME type for serving these files (e.g. over HTTP). 
                   
                  The ISO/IEC 14496 standard is broad, and therefore the type of data 
                  that may be in such a file can vary. In brief, simple compressed 
                  video and audio (using a number of different compression algorithms) 
                  can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data about the 
                  presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside the 
                  file and so on. 
                   
                  The MIME types to be assigned to MP4 files SHOULD be "audio/mp4", and 
                  "video/mp4" , based on the criteria in 4.1. In either case, these 
                  indicate files conforming to the "MP4" specification (ISO/IEC 14496-
                  1:2000, systems file format). 
                   
                  4.3] When an MP4 file is served (e.g. over HTTP) or otherwise must be 
                  identified by a MIME type, the type "video/mp4" SHOULD be used.  The 
                  types "audio/mp4" MAY be used when the ISO/IEC 14496 presentation 
                  contained within the MP4 file has no visual presentation and refers 
                  to a pure audio presentation. 
                   
                  4.4] When a visual ISO/IEC 14496 ES is served (e.g. over HTTP or 
                  otherwise) and must be identified by a MIME type, the type 
                  "video/MPEG4-visual" SHALL be used. This MIME type may require 
                  optional parameters to carry all necessary information to configure a 
                  receiver: therefore no further meta-information (such as that defined 
                  by the MP4 file format or by the ISO/IEC 14496 Object Descriptor 
                  framework) has to be provided in the data, and the data itself merely 
                  represents the media content..  The format of the bit-stream, 
                  including timing etc., is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2. 
                   
                  4.5] In some cases, the initial object descriptor needs to be 
                  identified with a MIME type. In this case, the type 
                  "applications/mpeg4-iod" shall be supported, and the type 
                  "application/mpeg4-iod-xmt" may be supported. In the latter case, the 
                  IOD will be described in an XMT textual format. The 
                  InitialObjectDescriptor is defined in sub-clause 8.6.3.1 of ISO/IEC 
                  14496-1, and its XMT format is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001 PDAM 2.

                  4.6] When a flexmux stream is served (e.g. over HTTP) or otherwise 
                  must be identified by a MIME type, the type "application/mpeg4-
                  flexmux" SHALL be used.  These files consist of concatenated flexmux 
                  PDUs in transmission order. 
                    
                  4.7] In some cases, the information needed by a flexmux decoder needs 
                  to be identified with a MIME type. In this case, the type 
                  "application/mpeg4-flexmuxinfo" SHOULD be used. 
                   
                  4.8] The payload names used in an RTPMAP attribute within SDP, to 
                  specify the mapping of payload number to its definition, also come 
                  from the MIME namespace.  Each of the RTP payload mappings defined 
                  above has a distinct name.  It is recommended that visual streams be 
                  identified under "video", and audio streams be identified under 
                  "audio", and otherwise "application" be used.

                               A Framework for the delivery of MPEG-4       July 2001 
                
                
                  This specification considers only ISO/IEC 14496 Systems related 
                  issues. The usage of elementary audio or visual streams in other 
                  context does not require any specific statement about RTSP. 
                   
                  RTSP may be used as a session control protocol for sessions which 
                  carry ISO/IEC 14496 information.  When RTSP is used as a session-
                  control protocol: 
                   
                  5.1]  RTP SHOULD be used as the transport protocol. 
                   
                  5.2] The initial DESCRIBE format SHOULD be SDP.  If the SDP 
                  information reveals that an IOD is needed, and the terminal does not 
                  already have it, then a second DESCRIBE accepting an IOD SHOULD be 
                  performed (see above). 
                   
                  5.3] Note that if all ISO/IEC 14496 streams are closed (TEARDOWN) 
                  then the RTSP session ID will be lost.  The next (re-)opened stream 
                  will supply a new session ID.  Care should be taken that the target 
                  of the URL has not changed in the interval;  new DESCRIBEs may be 
                  needed. 
                   
               6 Use of URLs in ES_Descriptors 
                   
                  When it is necessary to reference an RTP stream directly from an 
                  ES_Descriptor, the URL field of the descriptor can be used.  For 
                  example, the URL could contain the SDP description of the stream 
                  using the "data:application/sdp" scheme. 
                   
                  When it is necessary to embed stream data directly inside an 
                  ES_Descriptor, the URL field of the descriptor can be used.  For 
                  example, the URL could contain the data using the correct MIME type. 
                  In this case, the data consists of one SL packet that contains one 
                  access unit. 
                   
               7 Security Considerations 
                   
                  RTP packets using the payload formats referred to in this 
                  specification are subject to the security considerations discussed in 
                  the RTP specification [1]. This implies that confidentiality of the 
                  media streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression 
                  used with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may 
                  be performed on the compressed data so there is no conflict between 
                  the two operations. The packet processing complexity of this payload 
                  type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the receiver 
                  side to cause a denial-of-service threat. 
                   
                  However, it is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, 
                  Video, and Systems) to overload the receiver/decoder's buffers which 
                  might compromise the functionality of the receiver or even crash it. 
                  This is especially true for end-to-end systems like MPEG where the 
                  buffer models are precisely defined.

                               A Framework for the delivery of MPEG-4       July 2001 
                
                
                  ISO/IEC 14496 Systems supports stream types including commands that 
                  are executed on the terminal like OD commands, BIFS commands, etc. 
                  and programmatic content like MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte Code) and 
                  ECMASCRIPT. It is possible to use one or more of the above in a 
                  manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash or temporarily make the 
                  receiver unavailable.  
                   
                  Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and 
                  the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
                  ISO/IEC 14496 streams. 
                   
                  A security model is defined in ISO/IEC 14496 Systems streams carrying 
                  MPEG-J access units which comprises Java(TM) classes and objects. 
                  MPEG-J defines a set of Java APIs and a secure execution model. MPEG-
                  J content can call this set of APIs and Java(TM) methods from a set 
                  of Java packages supported in the receiver within the defined 
                  security model. According to this security model, downloaded byte 
                  code is forbidden to load libraries, define native methods, start 
                  programs, read or write files, or read system properties. 
                   
                  Receivers can implement intelligent filters to validate the buffer 
                  requirements or parametric (OD, BIFS, etc.) or programmatic (MPEG-J, 
                  ECMAScript) commands in the streams. However, this can increase the 
                  complexity significantly.  
                   
                   
                   
               8 Multicast considerations 
                   
                  When using IP Multicast, the SDP information describing the ISO/IEC 
                  14496 Session should be made available to the terminal. In addition, 
                  elementary stream descriptors may use URLs to directly address ESs.  
                  The goal of such URL would be to convey information to enable the 
                  terminal to directly connect to the RTP channel carrying the ES. The 
                  URL may contain the SDP information required to access the stream as 
                  described in section 10 above.

                  This draft has benefited greatly by contributions from many people, 
                  including Mike Coleman, Jean-Claude Duford, Viswanathan Swaminathan, 
                  Peter Westerink, Carsten Herpel, Olivier Avaro, Paul Christ, Zvi 
                  Lifshitz, and many others.  Their insight, foresight, and 
                  contribution is gratefully acknowledged.  Little has been invented 
                  here by the author;  this is mostly a collation of greatness that has 
                  gone before.
