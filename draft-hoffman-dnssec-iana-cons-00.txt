                 Revised IANA Considerations for DNSSEC
                    draft-hoffman-dnssec-iana-cons-00

Abstract

   This document changes the review requirements needed to get DNSSEC
   algorithms and resource records added to IANA registries.  It updates
   RFC 6014, which did not include hash algorithms for DS records or
   NSEC3 parameters in the change to all registries requiring RFCs, not
   standards, for inclusion in the IANA registries.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC is primarily described in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035].
   DNSSEC in common uses two resource records beyond those defined in
   RFC 4034, namely DS [RFC3658] and NSEC3 [RFC5155].

   [RFC8126] describes the requirements for listing in the myriad IANA
   registries.  [RFC6014] updated the requirements for how DNSSEC
   cryptographic algorithm identifiers in the IANA registries are
   allocated, reducing the requirements from being "Standards Action" to
   "RFC Required".

   The IANA registry requirements for hash algorithms for DS records and
   for the hash algorithms used in NSEC3 are still "Standards Action".
   This document updates RFC 6014 to bring the requirements for DS
   records and NSEC3 hash algorithms in line with the rest of the DNSSEC
   cryptographic algorithms, .

2.  IANA Considerations

   In the "Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) NextSECure3 (NSEC3)
   Parameters" registry, the registration procedure for "DNSSEC NSEC3
   Flags", "DNSSEC NSEC3 Hash Algorithms", and "DNSSEC NSEC3PARAM Flags"
   are changed from "Standards Action" to "RFC Required".

   In the "Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record (RR) Type Digest
   Algorithms" registry, the registration procedure for "Digest
   Algorithms" is changed from "Standards Action" to "RFC Required".

3.  Security Considerations

   Changing the requirements for getting security algorithms added to
   IANA registries as described in this document will make it easier to
   get good algorithms added to the registries, and will make it easier
   to get bad algorithms added to the registries.  It is impossible to
   weigh the security impact of those two changes.

Appendix A.  Other Options for Requirements Level

   During an early discussion in the DNSOP Working Group, it was
   proposed that the requirements for registry allocation for DS
   resource records be "Specification Required".  This would reduce the
   work required of specification authors, and of the RFC Editor, while
   still requiring review by an expert reviewer and a long-lived
   specification.
