Abstract

   The current Email infrastructure has the property that any host
   sending mail to the mail system can identify itself as any user name
   it wants.  Furthermore, the current Email framework neither
   authenticates the sender nor traces the source of the mail, so even
   find a spam, the method is just to reject the mail or insert the mail
   source into "blacklist", and both of these methods can!_t deracinate
   the generation of spam.  This document design a Email source address
   authentication based on true IPv6 address access to identify and
   authenticate the mail source address, to trace the mail sender
   effectively, and to deracinate the generation of spam.

Internet-Draft   TESF Based on True IPv6 Address Access    November 2010


1.  Introduction

   The current e-mail infrastructure has the property that any host
   injecting mail into the mail system can identify itself as any user
   name it wants.  While this feature is desirable in some
   circumstances, it is a major obstacle to reducing Unsolicited Bulk
   E-mail (UBE, aka "spam").  Furthermore, the current email framework
   on Internet can!_t trace the source of Email, so it can't deracinate
   the generation of spam.

   This document design a Email source address authentication based on
   true IPv6 address access.  The authentication is devided into inter-
   domain authentication and intra-domain authentication.  For the
   purposes of this document, authentication is seen from a user
   perspective, and is intended to answer the question "who sent this
   email and if the IP address he used has passed the authentication."
   where "who" is the email address the recipient sees and IP address
   pass the authentication means we can find out the sender of the spam
   using this IP address.

   This document defines a protocol by which domain owners may authorize
   its user and the user's IP addressto use their domain name in the
   "MAIL FROM" or "HELO" identity.  For other domain's mail,
   authenticate the domain included in "MAIL FROM" and "FROM" fields,
   because these two fields are mostly abused.

1.1.  Motivation

   TESF(Trusted Email System Framework) is a simple and effective mail
   source authentication mechanism which is used to trace the sender of
   the spam by sender domain and affirm the sender domain by the
   receiver domain.

   TESF has the following characteristic:

   1.  Using IP address authentication to avoid the sender denies his
       mail;

   2.  Using variational IP address to support user mobility;

   3.  It can trace the spam sender by binding user's fixed IP address;

   4.  Using two levels authentication methanism to improve authentation
       efficency;

   5.  Support both of mail forwarding and mailing list.

2.  TESF Overview

   TESF divides the authentication to inter-domain and intra-domain
   authentication.  Inter-domain authentication is used to authenticate
   the mail sender!_s domain.  It combines path authentication-based,
   cryptographic authentication-based and reputation and accreditation
   system-based methods in order to support both of mail forwarding and
   mail list.  Authentication efficiency can be further improved by
   organizing authentication order properly.  Intra-domain is used to
   affirm the sender!_s IP address which is used to trace the sender.
   It supports user!_s mobility by combining the fixed and variational
   IP address.

   For intra-domain user's sending request, mail server first request
   his username and password, and then authenticae his IP address, if
   both pass, send the mail and add a Domainkeys signature on the mail
   header.

   For inter-domain's mail, mail source authenticaion flow isGBPo

   1.  Black-white list authentication;

   2.  SPF authentication;

   3.  Domainkeys authentication.

   For these three authentication, if anyone of them success, the finial
   authenticated result is success so that it can support both of mail
   forwording and mailing list, otherwise, authentication result is
   failed.

3.  TESF detailed view

3.1.  Intra-domain authentication

   This module is used to authenticate user's identity, and it contain
   SASL and IPv6 address authentication.  It first authenticates user's
   username and password using SASL, and then authenticates user's IP
   address.  If either one of them failed, reject this user.


              +--------+ Yes  +---------+ No   +-----------+ Yes
   login----->|  SASL  |----->| IP used |----->|IP Password|----->accept
              +--------+       +---------+      +-----------+
                  |No              |Yes              |No
                  V                V                 V
                reject           accept            reject

                                 Figure 2

3.1.1.  IPv6 address

   According to RFC3513, even the same host computer, at the different
   time, its IPv6 address is different.  So, match IPv6 address can't
   match all of the 128bits while match part of them, for example, just
   match first 64 bits, and this means the authentication precision is a
   link of a network.

   Further more, IP address in this document is means IPv6 address.

3.1.2.  IPv6 address authentication

   For every user, his corresponding information include a fixed IP
   address and a variational IP address list.

   IPv6 address authentication algorithm is as follows:

   1.  If user's current IP address equal to his fixed IP address,
       authenticaion success, goto 4, otherwise goto 2.

   2.  If user's current IP address exsit in his variational IP address
       list, authenticaion success, goto 4, otherwise goto 3.

   3.  Request user to input his IP auth password, if match, update the
       variational IP address list, authenticaion success, goto 4,
       otherwise authentication failed, goto 4.

   4.  Algorithm Ends.

3.1.3.  Update of variational IP address list

   Variational IP address list storage user's variational IP addresses
   (mobility user's temporary address).  It's organised as a list, and
   every element in the list contain a IP address and a counter.  If
   user's current IP address is neither his fixed IP address nor in his
   variational IP address list, update the variational IP address list
   according to the LRU algorithm.

   a.  If variational IP address list doesn't reach its max length, add
       the current IP address into the variational IP address list and
       then set all the couter to 0.

   b.  If current IP address exist in the variational IP address list,
       add its counter by 1.

   c.  If don't match these two rules, find out the minimaze counter in
       the list (if there are more than one of these IP address, find
       out the last one), delete it and add the current IP address into
       the variational IP address list and then set all the couter to 0.

   We expatiate these three rules bellow, suppose max list size is 5,
   current user jack@mail.neu6.edu.cn's list size is 4.

   a.  If jack@mail.neu6.edu.cn use a new IP address 2001:200:0:8002:*
       to send mail, IP address list change as follows, suppose there
       just match first 64 bits of IPv6 address, so the last 64 ones is
       ignored.

                                   Figure 3

   b.  If jack@mail.neu6.edu.cn use 5f1b:df0:ce3e:e200:* to send mail,
       because this address is already exsit in the address list, so
       just add the counter by 1.

3.2.  Inter-domain authentication

   Inter-domain authentication is used to affirm the mail's domain.  It
   conbines multi-methanisms to offset the weakness of just use one
   methanism.  It combines path authentication-based, cryptographic
   authentication-based and reputation and accreditation system-based
   methods in order to support both of mail forwarding and mail list.
   Authentication efficiency can be further improved by organizing
   authentication order properly.  The path authentication-based method
   is SPF, cryptographic authentication-based is Domainkeys and
   reputation and accreditation system-based method is blacklist.

   Because reputation can't affirm if the mail sender domain is true, it
   can just affirm which domain always sends spam, so first do the

   reputation authentication, reject the domain exsiting in the
   blacklist.  For SPF and Domainkeys, SFP is authenticted before the
   mail body is send while Domainkeys is authenticated after all the
   mail is send, meanwhile SPF's effiency is better then Domainkeys, so
   do SPF first and then do Domainkeys authentication.  So, if SPF is
   success, there is no need to do the Domainkeys, which can further
   improve the authenticaiton effiency.  Inter-domain authenticaion flow
   is as follows:

   1.  Do the DNS blacklist authenticaion, if the sender domain is in
       the blacklist, reject it, otherwise do the SPF authentication.

   2.  Do SPF authenticaion, if success, add "X-Mail-Source-Auth: Pass"
       into mail's header, inter-domain authenticaion success, otherwise
       do Domainkeys authentication.

   3.  If Domainkeys authentication successGBP[not]add "X-Mail-Source-
       Auth: Pass" into mail's header, inter-domain authenticaion
       success, otherwise inter-domain authenticaion failed, reject the
       sending request.

   The Inter-domain authenticaion flow is:

4.  Examples

4.1.  Intra-domain authentication

   This module is a extension of SASL.  If IPv6 address authentication
   success, it same as the normal SASL, otherwise need user to input his
   IP auth password.

4.1.1.  IP address authentication faild

   If user's current IP address isn't his fixed IP and doesn't exsit in
   his variational IP address, mail server request user to input his IP
   auth password.

4.1.2.  IP address authentication sucess

   If user's current IP address is his fixed IP or exsit in his
   variational IP address, it's the same as the traditional SASL.

4.2.  Inter-domain authentication

4.2.1.  Original mail

   The example mail is:


   From: "liupc" <liupc@testmail2.neu6.edu.cn>
   To: liupc@testmail.neu.edu.cn
   Subject: test

4.2.2.  Mail dealed by sender domain

   User's mail is dealed at his domain MTA, which add some header fields
   and Domainkeys signature.  For the example mail above, the mail is
   changed to:

4.2.3.  Mail passed inter-domain authentication

   Receiver's domain MTA add the "X-Mail-Source-Auth-Domain: PASS" and
   some other headers.  Suppose the mail above passes Domainkeys while
   fail SPF, and the mail is changed to:

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  DNS

   The objective of the SAAF is to authenticate the sender domain by a
   reliable ways, but SAAF mostly depends on DNS, which is vulnerable.

   The SAAF increases the load of the DNS servers, for it has to provide
   SPF records and Domainkey records for receiver MTA.  Frequent using
   The SAAF makes the DNS query increase sharply, and then lots of cheat
   IP addresses appear, which makes the situation more and more worse.

5.2.  Key management

   Because Domainkeys is one of the main part of the SASF, one of
   problems is to guarantee the security of the private key.  Once the
   private key is lost, the whole mechanism will be disable.

5.3.  DNS spoofing

   If there is a spam sender applies an independent domain, configures
   SPF and Domainkeys in it, then the SAAF will be disable.  And with
   the growth of the spam senders under this domain, the domain will be
   added into blacklist, then the successive spams will rejected
   directedly.  But the spams before that will be delivered.

6.  Notes to Implementers

   Besides the modifications of the e-mail system, one of the most
   important works is to make DNS to support TESF, that is, configures
   TXT records of the SPF and Domainkeys in the DNS servers.
