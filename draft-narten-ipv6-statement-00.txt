Internet-Draft       IETF Statement on IPv4 and IPv6       November 2007


Abstract

   Over the last year, the Internet community has slowly come to realize
   that the IANA and RIR IPv4 free address pool will be exhausted within
   no more than 3-4 years, and possibly sooner.  At that point, it will
   become increasingly difficult for ISPs and end sites to obtain the
   public IPv4 address space they need to expand operations.

   IPv6 was developed to address the IPv4 address exhaustion problem,
   but widespread deployment has barely begun.  This document reiterates
   the IETF's support and continued commitment to IPv6.  IPv6 deployment
   is still necessary to ensure the continued growth and expansion of
   the Internet.  Deployment of IPv6 is needed to preserve important
   Internet properties that have made it a success and enable new
   generations of applications and services.

1.  Introduction

   Over the last year, the Internet community has come to realize that
   the IANA and RIR free pool of IPv4 addresses will be exhausted within
   3-4 years, and possibly sooner.  For example, Geoff Huston's "IPv4
   Address Report" [1] strongly suggests that IANA free pool will be
   exhausted by summer 2010, with the remaining RIR pool exhausted by
   summer 2011.  However, even these projections are conservative, and
   the actual dates may well occur sooner.  The model assumes that the
   rate of address space consumption will follow "recent history" and
   not change as the free pool dwindles, and that there will be no
   "rush" by ISPs and end sites to obtain additional address space
   before the free pool is exhausted.  Other reports also suggest that
   the free pool will be exhausted soon [2].

   In the last few months, ICANN [3] and each of the five Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) have issued statements warning the
   community of the impending free pool exhaustion and encouraging the
   community to deploy IPv6 (AFRINIC [4], APNIC [5], ARIN [6],
   LACNIC [7], RIPE [8]).

   IPv6 was developed to address the IPv4 address exhaustion problem
   [RFC1752][RFC1726].  And although IPv6 has been widely implemented in
   commercial and other products, widespread deployment has barely
   begun.  This document reiterates the IETF's support and commitment to
   IPv6.  IPv6 deployment is necessary to ensure the continued growth
   and expansion of the Internet.  Deployment of IPv6 is needed to
   preserve the important properties of the Internet that have made it a
   success and enable new generations of applications and services.

2.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 Free Pool

   Today's Internet already suffers from address shortages.  The need to
   conserve public address space has led the RIRs to adopt address
   assignment policies that demand a high utilization of address space;
   ISPs and end sites are required to show use of 80% of their existing
   address space in order to qualify for more.

   In practice, many users already feel that obtaining IPv4 address
   space is "too hard".  In practice, it is often easier and more
   convenient to use Network Address Translation (NAT) than to obtain
   public address space.

   The exact point at which the IPv4 free pool will become exhausted is
   more a matter of academic than practical interest.  Exhaustion of the
   free pool doesn't mean that the IPv4 internet will suddenly stop
   working; indeed, it will continue working as it already does --
   devices that already have assigned addresses will continue to work as
   they did before.  However, sites needing additional addresses to
   support growth will find the cost and overhead of managing and
   finding available IPv4 address space to increase.  Holders of
   existing address space may be able to squeeze out additional usable
   addresses by more aggressively managing their existing resources.  It
   may also be possible to purchase address space on an open market,
   should a market develop as some expect.  Increased reliance upon and
   use of NAT, including within single organizations, is also likely to
   occur.

   While some steps could be taken to alleviate some aspects of the
   looming IPv4 address shortage (e.g., attempt to return underutilized
   address space to the free pool, attempt to make use of "reserved"
   space [draft-fuller-240space-00.txt], etc.), such steps are tactical
   at best and do not address the Internet's fundamental need to have
   sufficient address space.  The IPv4 free pool is currently being
   consumed at a rate of more than 10 /8s per year, a demand that cannot
   realistically be satiated by tactical steps that only satisfy a few
   months of demand.

   In summary, the exhaustion of the IPv4 free pool means that the cost
   of managing and finding usable IPv4 address space will increase,
   perhaps sharply.  That cost is already increasing today, and will
   likely increase more rapidly once the free pool is fully depleted.
   In addition, increased usage of NAT will increase operational costs,
   due to the inherent limitations of NAT [RFC2993].  The amount of pain
   this causes will vary from one organization to another, depending
   heavily on how fast the organization is growing, the rate of network
   expansion, and the types of services that need to be supported.

3.  The Need for IPv6

   IPv6 was developed to address the inherent address size limitations
   of IPv4 [RFC1752][RFC1726].  Because addressing this limitation
   required changing the basic IP packet format (i.e., making
   incompatible changes to IPv4), additional features and benefits were
   added as well.  While some of those changes have benefits for
   specific environments, it is IPv6's expanded addressing capability
   that provides its key value.  Indeed, a number of the "improvements"
   that were originally developed for IPv6 have since been retrofitted
   back into IPv4 (e.g., IPsec (security) and Differentiated Services
   (QOS)).  Other improvements (e.g., stateless address
   autoconfiguration, multiple address support, etc.), while important,
   do not appear to be sufficiently compelling on their own to justify
   the significant effort involved in IPv6 deployment.  Hence, the key
   IPv6 value derives from its vastly increased address space, which
   simply cannot be retrofitted into IPv4.

   IPv6's address space is needed to ensure the continued growth of the
   Internet, namely, the ability for all devices to connect to the
   network as first-class citizens.

   o  One of the most important architectural principles underpinning
      the Internet design is its support for the end-to-end principle
      [RFC1958].  To support that principle, every device must be able
      to have its own public address, so that communication with any
      other Internet node is possible.  While support for the end-to-end
      model has already eroded somewhat, depletion of the free pool
      threatens to accelerate the trend.

   o  Network Address Translation does not solve IPv4's address
      limitations; it is at best a tactical approach:

      *  NATs generally work only in simple deployment scenarios
         characterized by simple clients (e.g., browsers) communicating
         with servers on the public Internet.

      *  A basic assumption of NAT is that a small number of public IPv4
         addresses can be shared by a large number of simple clients.
         This assumption breaks down when large numbers of devices want
         to be "servers" and accept connections initiated by others.
         Session establishment between a client and a server becomes
         more complex in a NAT scenario with the traditional IETF
         protocols, and might not even be possible.

      *  Inherent limitations of NATs cause subtle and hard-to-diagnose
         operational problems.  Increased use of NAT will lead to an
         increasingly brittle Internet -- the exact opposite of what is

         required in an Internet infrastructure that is increasingly
         viewed as basic critical infrastructure, like electricity or
         water.

      *  Some protocols do not work correctly when NATs are present, and
         cannot always be made to work correctly.  This is especially
         true for peer-to-peer type protocols that do not follow the
         simple client-server model, or security protocols that view the
         translations made by NAT devices as security violations.  There
         is a real danger that entire classes of applications (i.e.,
         new, innovative services) simply cannot be deployed and built
         on an Internet in which NATs are widespread.

4.  The State of IPv6

   IPv6 (as a standard) is finished and has been widely implemented in
   products.  It is ready for deployment today and the community is
   urged to begin deployment in earnest.  But like with any significant
   service roll out, advance planning is necessary and some road bumps
   can be expected in local circumstances and with individual products.
   IT departments are urged to work closely with vendors to ensure that
   the necessary IPv6-enabled products will be available within an
   appropriate time frame.

   Like with IPv4 (which was "completed" in the early 1980s), the IETF
   continues (and will continue to) to work on individual technologies,
   but believes that "core" IPv6 work has been completed and done.  But
   like with IPv4 before it, there will always be individual
   technologies and individual protocols that require extension or
   improvement as more experience is gained.  As more experience with
   IPv6 is gained, the IETF stands ready to do additional IPv6-related
   work as justified.

   Originally, it was expected that IPv6 would be rolled out before IPv4
   address exhaustion occurred.  But that does not appear to be
   happening, given the current state of IPv6 deployment and the size of
   IPv4 free pool.  The key issue is the lack of a short-term return on
   investment (ROI) for early deployers.  The benefits of IPv6 are all
   long-term, with the cost/benefit assessment difficult to make in
   concrete dollar terms.
