Abstract

   This document defines dynamic paging area configuration extensions 
   to IP paging. The motivation is three fold: First, paging areas 
   are auto-configured, hence human effort is minimized. Second, 
   paging area shapes adapt to host mobility characteristics, hence 
   more efficient. Third, paging area sizes are variable, allowing 
   future optimization. 
   
   Dynamic paging area configuration can be regarded as the major 
   advantage of having L3 paging areas.

1.0 Introduction

   The DMHA (Dormant Mode Host Alerting) protocol offers IP paging
   services to dormant mode capable Internet hosts in order to reduce
   power and bandwidth consumption [PROB][REQ].
   
   The flexibility of IP paging allows dynamic paging area configuration. 
   Manual paging area configuration is difficult, prone to human error 
   and not necessarily well adapted to user movement. This document 
   defines extensions for Dynamic Paging Area Configuration (DPAC) for 
   flexibility of administration and better paging performance.
   
   DPAC aims to be scalable, low-cost and adaptive: Paging areas 
   should be available to millions of hosts regardless of their points 
   of attachment in a cellular system comprising millions of cells 
   (scalable). Furthermore, the cost of paging area configuration on 
   mobile host operation and bandwith consumption should be negligible 
   (low-cost). Finally, paging area shapes should adapt to hosts' 
   mobility characteristics in order to efficiently reduce the rate of 
   registrations. In addition, paging area shapes should adapt to the 
   changes in the cellular topology, e.g., the addition of a new
   cell (adaptive).
   
2.0 Paging area model

   A dynamically configured paging area is a list of network prefixes 
   (i.e. cells). The size of a paging area is the size of that list, 
   hence the number of cells. These paging areas have the following 
   properties:
   
     + Per-cell: There is a paging area corresponding (relative) 
       to each cell. Naturally, paging areas overlap.
       
     + Loadable: A host requests the network a pre-configured
       paging area relative to its current cell.

     + Host-centered: A mobile host which obtains a new paging area 
       is initially at the center of that paging area.

3.0 Dynamic paging area configuration

3.1 Sampling 
   
   A Cellular Sampling Agent (CSA) is a new function responsable for
   collecting samples sent by mobile hosts moving in its domain.

   A sample is an ordered pair of adjacent cells. Samples are generated 
   randomly by mobile hosts. Upon location registration, a mobile host 
   sends a sample to its current CSA with a very small probability 
   (e.g. 1%, 2%) so that sampling has no impact on power consumption 
   on mobile hosts nor bandwith consumption. 
   
   The identity of the host which sends a given sample has no
   importance. This way DPAC captures the aggregated movement
   characteristics which are more or less common to each individual
   host. This sampling policy is at the heart of DPAC scalability.
      
   Then, the collected samples give the "aggregated host direction 
   probabilities" in each cell of a CSA domain. In a given cell A, the 
   probability of a given direction is the probability of moving to a 
   corresponding cell in the neighborhood. For example, the samples 
   [A|B], [A|C], [A|D], [A|B], ... will help extract the direction 
   probabilities in cell A. This is illustrated  in Figure 1.

   For example, on a two-way highway the direction probabilities 
   will be approximately 0.5 and 0.5 in each cell along that highway.

3.2 Paging area composition
   
   A paging area PA relative to a given cell A and of a given size S, 
   can be composed as follows:
   
   	PA={A};			\\initially the paging area contains
   				\\only one cell.
   	i=1;
   	
   	while (i<S){
   		add to PA, the cell which  	\\this cell is computed
   		would be most probably visited  \\using the movement 
   		upon leaving PA;		\\direction 
   						\\probabilities.
   		i++; 
   	}	
 
   This way, the shape of PA adapts to the aggregated host mobility 
   pattern around the cell A. 
   
   Using the algorithm described above, the CSA can configure a paging 
   area relative to each cell in its domain. The paging area size can 
   be fixed by the operator. However, by configuring large paging areas, 
   it is possible to choose smaller paging areas later.

   For example, let 
      
   	PA={A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K}      (S=11)
   	
   a paging area relative to cell A, configured as above. Then, by 
   preserving the same order, one can pick smaller paging areas such
   as:
   
   	PA' ={A,B,C,D,E,F}		(S=6)	
   	PA" ={A,B,C}			(S=3)
   
   where PA, PA' and PA" are concentric paging areas relative to a
   same cell A and they have all an optimal shape.
   
   See Section 7 for the motivations behind paging area size 
   flexibility.

4.0 Convergence of paging areas

   How much time will take the convergence of paging areas? Assume 
   the following parameters:
   
   	#users/cell = 25 (uniformly distributed)
   	#registrations / host / hour = 1 (on the average)
        Sampling rate = 2% (i.e. 1 sample / 50 registrations)

   Then assuming that one needs on the average 50 samples/cell,
   then the CSA will have enough information for composing the

INTERNET DRAFT                   DPAC                     September 2001

   paging areas relative to each cell in its domain, in:
   
   	                 50
   	        -------------------- = 100 hours (~5 days)
   	        25 x 1 x 0.02 / hour
   
   In the same manner, if the sampling rate is 1%, the convergence of
   paging areas will take ~9 days (which is still in the acceptable
   region). This is a promising prediction although we make weak 
   assumptions. In practice both number of users and registration 
   rates are higher. On the other hand, the number of samples that is
   needed for convergence, depends on hosts' mobility characteristics. 
   For example, along a one-way highway where all mobiles move in the same 
   direction, 1 sample/cell will be enough. However, when host mobility 
   pattern is less predictable (in urban areas for example), more samples 
   will be needed.   
   
   The convergence speed is self-tuning. As mentioned above, samples 
   are sent upon location registrations. Therefore, initially (when 
   there is no configured paging areas), hosts will send location 
   registrations frequently (hence, sampling frequency will be high). 
   Then, as the paging areas converge, the rate of registrations 
   hence, sampling frequency will gradually decrease.

5.0 Model of operation with relevance to the DMHA protocol
   
   Dynamically configured paging areas have to be communicated to 
   mobile hosts. Then, the DMHA protocol should operate as follows:
   
     1. Whenever a host crosses the boundaries of a paging area,
        it requests its current paging agent a paging area relative 
	to its current cell along with its registration message, 
     
     2. The paging agent sends this information to the requesting
        host along with an acknowledgement message,
     
     3. The host remains dormant while moving in the paging area,
     
     4. When a packet destined for the dormant host arrives,
        the paging agent pages the host in its most recent paging area. 
   
   Secondly, paging has to be carried out in a SMG (Small Group 
   Multicast) style [SGM]. In this scheme, all destination cell 
   addresses forming a paging area are initially carried in a page 
   packet header. Then, the addresses are split by intervening 
   routers forwarding the packet to two or more interfaces. This is 
   illustrated in Figure 2.

6.0 How to support DPAC in current DMHA protocol proposals? 
  
   In MIPv6HP [HP] dormant mode state is hold by a MAP [HMIP]. MAPs 
   can be augmented with CSA functionality for sampling and paging 
   area composition. The MAP will be responsable for sampling and 
   composing the paging areas relative to the cells in its domain.
   Samples can be sent along with dormant mode registrations (in a 
   Binding Update sub-option). Paging area request and reply messages
   can be also defined as Binding Update sub-options.

   In LH-DMHA [LH], the last contacted access router holds the dormant 
   mode state. The CSA function can be implemented on a MAP or a 
   dedicated machine. Then, LH-DMHA can be augmented with a message 
   exchange between the CSA and each access router in its domain. In 
   this case, the CSA will configure paging areas as described above 
   and send each access router in its domain the paging area relative 
   to the cell served by that access router. The access router will 
   cache this information, and periodically (once per week for example) 
   update it by requesting the CSA a new one in order to adapt to some 
   changes in paging area shape. Paging area request and reply 
   messages can be defined in TLV formatted LH-DMHA messages.
   
7.0 Picking the paging area size   
   
   Manual configuration of paging area sizes is considered 
   difficult. A cellular operator faces an impossible decision:
   
      1. If I choose large paging areas, then I'll increase the
         cost of paging,
	 
      2. If I choose small paging areas, then I'll increase the rate
         of registrations and battery consumption.

   What do to? In current systems, cellular operators choose fixed 
   paging area sizes. This is by no means optimal.
   
   DPAC will support adaptive schemes with per-host and time-varying 
   paging area sizes (picked by each individual host) [ADAPT]. This 
   scheme minimizes the costs of location tracking and provides better

   power savings. The idea is quite simple: If a host moves slowly, 
   then the paging area for that host can be small since the cost of 
   registrations will be small. On the other hand, if a host rarely 
   receives incoming sessions, the paging area for that host can be 
   large since the cost of paging will be small. 
   
   If the DMHA protocol is DPAC compatible (as described in Section 5), 
   a host can request its paging agent a paging area of a personally
   defined size which adapts well to its mobility and incoming 
   session rate characteristics. This way paging area sizes can be
   also auto-configured.
   
8.0 Security considerations
   
   Security issues with relevance to paging area auto-configuration,
   are not discussed in this document.

9.0 Conclusion   
   
   The flexibility of IP paging allows dynamic paging area configuration. 
   With auto-configured, adaptive paging area shapes and flexible paging
   area sizes, this can be regarded as the major advantage of having 
   L3 paging areas. In this document we proposed dynamic paging area 
   configuration extensions to IP paging.
