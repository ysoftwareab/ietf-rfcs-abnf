Abstract

   The Conference Policy is defined as the complete set of rules for a
   particular conference manipulated by the conference policy server.
   The Conferece Policy Control Protocol (CPCP) is the protocol used by
   client to manipulate the conference policy.  This document defines an
   XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) application usage that may
   be used to store and manipulate a conference policy.

   There also exists an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that
   enumerates the conference policy meta data that enable a user to
   assign privileges to users that enables them to read and/or
   manipulate parts of or the entirety of a conference policy.  This
   document defines an XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP)
   application usage that may be used to store and manipulate a
   conference policy priveleges XML document.

Internet-Draft             Conferencing-XCAP                October 2004


1.  Introduction

   The SIP conferencing framework [8] defines the mechanisms for
   multi-party centralized conferencing in a SIP environment.

   Existing SIP mechanisms allow users, for example, to join and leave a
   conference, as described in [5].  A centralised server, called focus,
   can expel and invite users, and may have proprietary access control
   lists and user privilege definitions.  The Conference Policy Control
   Protocol [1] defines an XML Schema that enumerates the conference
   policy data elements that enable a user to define a conference
   policy.  This policy document may be given to a focus using a number
   of transports.  Mechanisms such as a web page or a voice response
   system can also be used to manipulate conference policy data.

   Similarily, Privileges for Manipulating a Conference Policy [2]
   defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that enumerates
   the conference policy meta data that enable a user to assign
   privileges to users that enables them to read and/or manipulate a
   conference policy.  Mechanims are also needed to manipulate such
   data.

   In many cases it is useful to have standardised means to manipulate
   conference policy elements and conference policy privileges elements.
   Two XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [6] application usages
   are defined that allow for the real-time manipulation of conference
   policy and conference policy privileges and meets the requirements in
   [4] to store and manipulate a conference policy object and a
   conference policy privileges object.

   XCAP has many advantages in its use for conference policy control
   protocol.  It is a HTTP 1.1 based protocol that allows clients to
   read, write, modify and delete application data stored in XML format
   at a server.  XCAP maps XML document elements and attributes to HTTP
   URIs that can be directly accessed by HTTP.  One application area
   which has already adopted XCAP is the manipulation of event lists
   [7].

   For manipulation of the Conference Policy XML object, the system MAY
   support the XCAP usage defined in Section 4.  For manipulation of the
   Conference Policy Privileges XML object, the system MAY support the
   XCAP usage defined in Section 5.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from [8].  Some additional definitions
   are introduced in [1].

4.  An XCAP Usage for Conference Policy Manipulation

4.1  Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree.  This
   specification defines the "conference-policies" AUID within the IETF
   tree, via the IANA registration in Section 8.

4.2  Resource Interdependencies

   The conference policy server MAY fill the conference URI(s), but the
   client MUST propose a conference URI.  If the CPS does not allow
   assignments of URIs by the client, it rejects the request with a
   "409" response and SHOULD include a body in the response detailing
   the error.  XCAP Base document [6] section 7.2.1 explains how such a
   response body is constructed.  The CPS MAY assign multiple conference
   URIs to a conference, one for each call signaling protocol that it
   supports.  Section xx of [1] (Conference Settings) discusses this is
   more detail.

   Sidebar URIs are subject to the same behaviour.

4.3  Additional Constraints

   These are defined within the XML structure definition in [1].

4.4  Naming Conventions

   There are no naming conventions that need to be defined for this
   application usage.

4.5  Authorization Policies

   A server can allow privileged users to modify documents that they
   don't own.  The establishment and indication of such policies is done
   by setting the authorization rules as described in [2].

4.6  MIME Type for CPCP XML Document

   The MIME type for the CPCP XML document is defined in [1].

5.  An XCAP Usage for Conference Policy Privileges Manipulation

5.1  Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree.  This
   specification defines the "conference-policy-privileges" AUID within
   the IETF tree, via the IANA registration in Section 8.

5.2  Resource Interdependencies

   There are no resource interdependencies that need to be defined fo
   this application usage.

5.3  Additional Constraints

   These are defined within the XML structure definition in [2].

5.4  Naming Conventions

   The "filename" as defined in XCAP Base document [6] is used to
   describe the final path segment in the document selector.  This XCAP
   usage requires that the filename of the conference policy privileges
   be exactly the same as the filename given to the conference policy
   that it relates to.  This will save processing time in that the focus
   does not need to search all conference privileges documents looking
   for the right one.  This also eliminates any conflicts that may occur
   by disallowing more than one conference policy privileges document to
   exist for a single conference policy.

5.5  Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
   documents.

5.6  MIME Type for CPCP XML Document

   The MIME type for the Conference Policy Privileges XML document is
   defined in [2]

6.  Examples

6.1  Conference Policy Manipulation

6.1.1  Creating a Conference

   Continuing with the example in Section xx of [1], Alice's client uses

Internet-Draft             Conferencing-XCAP                October 2004


   XCAP to transport the conference policy to the conference policy
   server


      PUT
      http://xcap.example.com/services/conference-policies/users/Alice/c
      onference.xml HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/conference-policy+xml

      [conference policy from [1] example goes here].


   At exactly 2004-12-17T09:30:00-05:00, the focus sends SIP INVITE
   request to Alice and a SIP REFER request to Sarah.  At
   2004-12-17T09:25:00-05:00, SIP INVITE requests can be accepted from
   anyone at domain example.com.  Any attempts to join the conference by
   users in other domains are rejected.

6.1.2  Expelling a User

   After the conference has started, Alice decides to expel Bob who has
   joined the conference.  So she modifies the authorization rule that
   allows everyone at example.com to join:


      PUT
      http://xcap.example.com/services/conference-policies/users/Alice/c
      onference.xml/~~/conference/authorization-rules/rule[@id=""]/condi
      tions/identity/ HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type:text/plain



   	<identity>
   		<domain>example.com</domain>
   		<except>bob@example.com</except>
   	</identity>


   At this point, the focus sends a SIP BYE request to Bob ending Bob's
   participation in the conference.  This also guarantees that Bob
   cannot rejoin the conference since he is explicitly blocked.  Any
   attempt Bob makes in rejoining the conference will fail.

6.1.3  Allowing An Expelled Participant To Join Again

   Continuing with the example above, Alice now decides to allow Bob to
   join again after a period of time.  She does so by rewriting parts of

Internet-Draft             Conferencing-XCAP                October 2004


   the rule that blocks him from joining.


      PUT
      http://xcap.example.com/services/conference-policies/users/Alice/c
      onference.xml/~~/conference/authorization-rules/rule[@id=""]/condi
      tions/identity/ HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type:text/plain



   	<identity>
   		<domain>example.com</domain>
   	</identity>


   Bob can now rejoin the conference by sending a SIP INVITE request.

6.1.4  Allowing Sarah to Refer Users

   Alice now decides that Sarah can ask the focus to refer users to the
   conference:


      PUT
      http://xcap.example.com/services/conference-policies/users/Alice/c
      onference.xml/~~/conference/authorization-rules/rule[@id="3"]
      HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type:text/plain



   	<rule id="3">
   		<conditions>
   			<identity>
   				<uri>sarah@example.com</uri>
   			</identity>
   		</conditions>
   		<actions>
   			<allow-refer-users-dynamically>true</allow-refer-users-dynamically>
   		</actions>
   		<transformations/>
   	</rule>


6.1.5  Removing A Conference

   Alice now decides she no longer wants this conference to exist and

Internet-Draft             Conferencing-XCAP                October 2004


   therefore deletes the conference:


      DELETE
      http://xcap.example.com/services/conference-policies/users/Alice/c
      onference.xml


   As a result of this action, the focus sends SIP BYE requests to all
   current participants in the conference.  The conference server
   terminates the focus thereafter.

6.2  Conference Policy Privileges Manipulation

6.2.1  Creating Conference Policy Privilegtes

   Continuing with the example in Section xx of [2], Alice's client uses
   XCAP to transport the conference policy privileges to the conference
   policy server


      PUT
      http://xcap.example.com/services/conference-policy-privileges/user
      s/Alice/cp-privileges.xml HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/privileges+xml

      [conference policy privileges from [2] example goes here].


7.  Security Considerations

   The information contained in conference-policies and
   conference-policy-privileges documents are particularly sensitive.
   The former represents critical conference information like allowed
   user and conference time while the latter represents the list of
   privileged people with assigned privileges.  As a result, clients
   SHOULD use TLS when contacting servers in order to fetch this
   information.  Note that this does not represent a change in
   requirement strength from XCAP.  The XCAP base specification mandates
   that all XCAP servers MUST implement HTTP Authentication: Basic and
   Digest Access Authentication [9].  Furthermore, XCAP servers MUST
   implement HTTP over TLS [10].  It is recommended that administrators
   of XCAP servers use an HTTPS URI as the XCAP root services URI, so
   that the digest client authentication occurs over TLS.  By using
   these means, XCAP client and server can ensure the confidentiality
   and integrity of the XCAP created conference policy and conference
   policy privileges documents  and their manipulation operations, and
   that only authorized clients are allowed to perform them.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1  XCAP Application Usage IDs

8.1.1  conference-policies

   Name of the AUID: conference-policies
   Description: Conference policy application manipulates conference
   policy at a server.

8.1.2  conference-policy-privielges

   Name of the AUID: conference-policy-privileges
   Description: Conference policy privileges application manipulates
   conference policy privielges at a server.
