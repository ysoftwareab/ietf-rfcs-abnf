INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-kornijenko-ivis-urn-00.txt     February 2006


Abstract

This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace that is 
engineered by a consortium (general contractor - Olimps Ltd and 
subcontractors - ABC software LTD, Microsoft Latvia LTD, 
RIX Technologies LTD and Microlink LTD) for naming information resources
published and produced by the Latvian National Government Integration 
Project (latvian abbreviation - IVIS). 






1. Introduction

The IVIS uses and produces many kinds of information resources such as: 
E-services, E-service instances, specifications, standards, working 
documents, XML schemas, etc., which ID in IVIS has to be unique for 
global use every time.

2. Specification Template

2.1 Namespace ID:

      "IVIS" requested.

2.2 Registration information:

      Registration Version Number: 1
      Registration Date: 2006-MM-DD

2.3 Declared registrant of the namespace:

Name: Jurijs Kornijenko
Title: software architect	
Affiliation: Mag.sc.ing.
Address: Tallinas - 51, Riga, LV-1012
Phone: +371 7082635
Email: j.kornienko@abcsoftware.lv

2.4 Declaration of structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs assigned by the
      IVIS will have the following hierarchical structure:

<NID> ::= "IVIS"


<NSS>            ::= <IVIS Org ID>:<ResID - suffix>

<IVIS Org ID>    ::= <number>    { subsystem ID from IVIS database}

<ResID - suffix> ::= <upper> | <lower> | <number> | <other>  
{an ID generated by IVIS subsystem and that is unique within 
this subsystem}

   <other>          ::= "(" | ")" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." |
                        "=" | "@" | ";" | "$" |
                        "_" | "!" | "*" 

   <upper>          ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" |
                        "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" |
                        "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" |
                        "Y" | "Z"

   <lower>          ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" |
                        "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" |
                        "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" |
                        "y" | "z"

   <number>         ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
                        "8" | "9"

2.5 Relevant ancillary documentation: 

IVIS ancillary documentation is under development. 

2.6 Identifier uniqueness considerations:

Uniqueness is guaranteed by the IVIS that issues the numbers. 
The numbers are not re-assigned. 

2.7 Identifier persistence considerations:

Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon the persistence of 
the system name assignment by system name holders.

2.8 Process of identifier assignment:

All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled and managed 
by the IVIS and its subsystems.
2.9 Process of identifier resolution:

The holders of system names are responsible for operating or delegating 
resolution servers for the system in which they have assigned URNs. 

2.10  Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

The entire URN is case-insensitive.  
 
2.11 Conformance with URN syntax: 
 
IVIS schema URN fully conforms to RFC2141 syntax except that symbols "'" 
un ":" were 
excluded from <other>.
 
2.12 Validation mechanism:
 
<IVIS Org ID> could be validated by using special IVIS database service. 
<ResID - suffix> could be validated by appropriate subsystem.
  
2.13 Scope:

Global.

3. Example

The following examples are not guaranteed to be real.  They are provided 
for pedagogical reasons only:

    URN:IVIS:100001:DOC-METADATA
    URN:IVIS:100002:NDR1021365

4. Community Considerations

Every Latvian ministry, local authority produces many kinds of different 
documents, offers public services. Each of the information resources is 
unique identified within authority-producer already. IVIS URN namespace 
helps to unify information resource identifiers by using existent 
Latvian government authority identification procedures to produce
E-services and different documents where many parties are involved.
Any citizen or organization with Internet web browser capability 
will be entitled to access the namespace and its associated 
application, registration and resolution services. The primary IVIS 
namespace usage is to identify information resources, such as XML
messages, their schemas and other recourses, which can be public 
or have a special destination, when a few different parties are 
involved in the interchange.  


5. Namespace Considerations

To select necessary identifier schema we spend many time and made 
decision to URN side, because IVIS URN namespace have to resolve 
the following problems:

1.Information resource uniqueness 

Uniqueness gives possibility to find necessary resource and call it 
anytime. Uniqueness gives stability in message sending and storing 
operations.

2.Namespace understandability 

IVIS URN consists of parts, which can guarantee namespace legibility. 

3.Information resource resolution 

One of the IVIS namespace parts identifies the place, where resource can 
be found (resolved). 

So, a new URN assignment is required and individual URNs shall be 
assigned through the process of development of each XML schema.  


6. Security Considerations

There are no additional security considerations other than those 
normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
