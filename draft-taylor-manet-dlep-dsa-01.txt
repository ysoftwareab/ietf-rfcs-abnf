                 DLEP Destination Service Announcement
                     draft-taylor-manet-dlep-dsa-01

Abstract

   When using the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] to
   bootstrap neighbour discovery for routing protocols there is no
   indication in the core DLEP protocol of the services of the router
   announced at a destination.  This forces an implementation to either
   rely on a priori configuration or use heuristic probing of well-known
   ports to discover potential routing peers.

   This document defines an extension to DLEP to enable a router to
   advertise its active services to its peer modem, allowing a connected
   remote modem to announce the services of a router in a DLEP
   destination message to its peer, removing the need for service
   discovery between routing peers.  The mechanism is designed to be
   sufficiently generic to allow the advertisement of network services
   beyond routing protocols, enabling the fast bootstrapping of other
   protocols such as messaging protocols or header compression.

1.  Introduction

   One of the popular uses of the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)
   [RFC8175] is to improve the association time of routing protocol
   peers.  When a DLEP Destination Up Message is received by a router,
   routing protocol instances can be informed of potential peers,
   enhancing or avoiding the use of timed Hello messages, speeding up
   the convergence of nodes.  In practice this behaviour has many
   benefits, but does also have a downside: When a new potential peer is
   announced via DLEP, every routing protocol active on the receiver
   attempts to communicate with the potential peer trying to form a

Internet-Draft    DLEP Destination Service Announcement        July 2017


   neighbour association, with no prior indication if the destination
   router supports the routing protocol.  Particularly in a
   heterogeneous network when the capabilities of different routers is
   not known in advance, as links form between routers each new router
   may be bombarded by requests to form a routing adjacency from every
   protocol implementation active on every other reachable router in the
   network.

   This document defines an extension to DLEP that introduces a new Data
   Item to allow a router to announce to its DLEP session peer, during
   Session Initialization, the set of services that it supports, such as
   the running routing protocols.  A modem supporting this extension can
   transmit this information over the air using whatever internal
   protocol it uses for signalling to all connected modems.  Every other
   modem can then attach the received set of services to the DLEP
   Destination Up Message that it then sends to its DLEP session peer
   router.  Any changes to the set of services can also be sent via the
   Session Update Message, resulting in a corresponding DLEP Destination
   Update Message.

   This service announcement can be used to advertise the availability
   of more than just routing protocols.  Other protocols that need peers
   for their operation, such as peer-to-peer messaging applications, or
   discovering the presence of matching protocol compression proxies,
   can also use the same mechanism.

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Assumptions

   As an extension to DLEP, this document assumes any implementation of
   this extension correctly implements the core DLEP specification
   defined in [RFC8175].  No other DLEP extensions are required.

   This extension also assumes that supporting modems have the facility
   to transmit the set of services described by an attached router to
   other modems in the network.

3.  Service Descriptors

   Services active on a router are described using Service Descriptors,
   that are modelled on DNS SRV records [RFC2782], but with some
   important differences.  A Service Descriptor is a string that



Taylor                  Expires January 21, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    DLEP Destination Service Announcement        July 2017


   describes the name of the service, the IP protocol used by the
   service, optionally the name of the service instance, and optionally
   the port number used by the service if not the registered default
   port.

   The format of a Service Descriptor string is defined as:

    Service.Protocol.Name:Port

   Service:  The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in
      Assigned Numbers [RFC1700] or locally.  The maximum length of a
      Service is 15 characters.  The Service is case insensitive.

   Protocol:  The symbolic name of the desired protocol. 'tcp' and 'udp'
      are at present the most useful values for this field, though any
      name defined by Assigned Numbers or locally may be used (as for
      Service).  The Protocol is case insensitive.

   Name:  OPTIONAL.  The Name of the instance of the service active at
      the destination.  Unlike DNS SRV records, this name MAY not be a
      DNS name, but it MUST use the DNS name syntax.  The Name is case
      insensitive.

   Port:  OPTIONAL.  The port on router of this service.  The range is
      1-65535.  This field SHOULD only be specified if the port differs
      from the value specified in Assigned Numbers.

   As mentioned above, the Name field in a service descriptor MUST
   follow the DNS name syntax, but MAY not be a DNS name, as DLEP is
   often deployed in environments where DNS is not available.  However,
   the Name field still serves a purpose as a descriminiator for
   different instances of a service and could be used by a receiving
   router to make peering decisions.

   When a service operates as an IP protocol, rather than TCP, UDP, SCTP
   or DCCP, such as OSPF [RFC2328], the Protocol field MUST be specified
   as 'ip'.

   service-descriptor = service-part "." protocol-part
                         [ "." name-part [ ":" alt-port ] ]

   service-part       = *( 1*DIGIT [ "-" ] ) ALPHA
                         *( [ "-" ] ALNUM )   ; Maximum 15 characters

   protocol-part      = "tcp" / "udp" / "sctp" / "dccp" / "ip"

   name-part          = label *( "." label )
   label              = ALNUM *( [ "-" ] ALNUM )

   alt-port           = %x31-39 *DIGIT         ; Values of 1-65535

   ALNUM              = ALPHA / DIGIT
   ALPHA              = %x41-5A / %x61-7A    ; A-Z / a-z [RFC5234]
   DIGIT              = %x30-39              ; 0-9       [RFC5234]

4.  Operation

   To use this extension, as with all DLEP extensions, the extension
   MUST be announced during DLEP session initialization.  A router
   advertises support by including the value 'Destination Service
   Announcement' (TBD1) in the Extension Data Item within the Session
   Intitialization Message.  A modem advertises support by including the
   value 'Destination Service Announcement' (TBD1) in the Extension Data
   Item within the Session Intitialization Response Message.  If both
   DLEP peers advertise support for this extension then the Data Items
   described in this document MAY be used.  If a modem does not announce
   support for this extension, the router MUST NOT include any Data
   Items described in this document in any DLEP Message.

   If a router announces support for the 'Destination Service
   Announcement' extension in the Session Initialization Message, it MAY
   incude one or more IPv4 Destination Service Data Items (Section 5.1)
   and/or [IPv6 Destination Service Data Items] (#v6_dca_di) in the
   Session Initialization Message, as a DLEP compliant modem
   implementation that does not support this extension will correctly
   ignore the unknown.

4.1.  Service Description Information Base

   In order to describe the correct operation of this extension, a
   conceptual service descriptor information base is described that
   contains the set of service descriptors current announced by a router
   during a DLEP session.  A modem that supports this extension is
   described as maintaining a service descriptor information base
   recording the set of service descriptors advertised by its local
   router, ready to relay this information to any over-the-air peers



Taylor                  Expires January 21, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    DLEP Destination Service Announcement        July 2017


   that support this extension with which it forms a link.  An
   implementation is, of course, free to choose alternative ways of
   providing compliant functionality.

   When a modem receives a Session Initialization Message from its local
   router containing an Extension Supported Data Item announcing its
   support for this extension, and one or more Destination Service Data
   Items, it records this service information in the service descriptor
   information base.

   In order to retract a previously advertised service or announce the
   availability of a new service, the router sends a new Session Update
   Message to the modem containing a relevant Destination Service Data
   Item using the Add/Remove flag to indicate the change.

   When a modem receives a Session Update Message from its local router
   containing one or more Destination Service Data Items, it updates the
   set of service descriptors in its service descriptor information
   base.

4.2.  Over-the-air signalling

   When a modem forms a new link with a remote modem, it sends the
   contents of the service descriptor information base to the remote
   modem.  How this information is sent is an implementation detail that
   is out of scope of this document.

   When a modem supporting this extension receives a set of service
   descriptors from a remote modem, it SHOULD propogate this information
   to its DLEP peer router by including one or more Destination Service
   Data Items in the associated Destination Up Message.

   When the service descriptor information base of a modem is updated,
   as a result of a Session Update Message containing one or more
   Service Description Data Items, it informs all currently connected
   remote modems of the change.  Each remote modem that receives such a
   notification SHOULD announce the change in remote router services by
   sending a Destination Update Message to their attached router
   containing one or more Destination Service Data Items describing the
   update in services.

5.  DLEP Data Items for Destination Service Announcement

   This extension introduces two new DLEP Data Items, described below.
   Both Data Items carry information about destination services, one for
   IPv4, the other for IPv6.

Internet-Draft    DLEP Destination Service Announcement        July 2017


   One or more instances of either or both Destination Service Data
   Items MAY appear in the DLEP Session Initialization, Session Update,
   Destination Up, and Destination Update Messages.

   A router MAY use one or more instances of either or both Data Items
   in the DLEP Session Initialization Message to advertise all services
   that are currently available at the router, and a router MAY use one
   or more instances of either or both Data Items in the DLEP Session
   Update Message to advertise a change in the services that are
   currently available at the router.

   A modem MAY include one or more instances of either or both Data
   Items in the DLEP Destination Up and Destination Update Messages to
   inform its DLEP session peer of the services available at a remote
   DLEP destination.

   A router announcing services MUST NOT report the same combination of
   address and service in more than one Data Item per Message.  A modem
   that receives multiple Data Items with the same address and service
   descriptor in a single Message SHOULD treat this as an invalid Data
   Item in the Message, and react as defined in the core DLEP
   specification.

   A modem receiving a Destination Service Data Item with the Add/Remove
   flag cleared (zero) retracts any previously announced service from
   its service descriptor information base, and MUST inform all
   connected remote modems of the change.  If a retraction of a
   destination service does not match a previous announcement, the
   implementation SHOULD treat this as an invalid Data Item and react as
   defined in the core DLEP specification.

   Destination Service Data Items MUST NOT be included in any DLEP
   Destination Message referring to a multicast destination.

5.1.  IPv4 Destination Service Data Item

   The IPv4 Destination Service Data Item contains the following fields:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   An implementation MUST NOT assume the Service Descriptor field is

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension introduces a mechanism for routers to announce their
   services to other potential peers.  In cases where an adversary can
   manipulate the list of services, by either accessing the network
   segment between router or modem, or by intercepting any signalling
   between modems, this list of services may be altered if the link is
   not secured.

   Therefore:

   o  Any implementation MUST follow the security considerations defined
      in the core DLEP protocol.

   o  Any implementation, when used in an environment where the
      signalling between modems may be open to interception, MUST apply
      any relevant security considerations for the modem to modem
      signalling.

   It should be also noted that a malicious router could attempt to deny
   service to a network by rapidly and repeatedly announcing a varying

Internet-Draft    DLEP Destination Service Announcement        July 2017


   set of services, forcing the modems to flood the over the air
   signalling with updates.  A modem implementation MUST be aware of
   this risk and implement mitigations, such as aggregating the changes
   and trottling the updates propogated between devices.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests to IANA.

7.1.  Registrations

   This specification defines two new Data Items for DLEP.  Assignments
   from the DLEP Data Item registry are requested for:

   o  IPv6 Destination Service

   o  IPv4 Destination Service

   The specification also defined an extension to the DLEP protocol.  An
   assignment from the DLEP extension registry is requested for
   'Destination Service Announcement'.
