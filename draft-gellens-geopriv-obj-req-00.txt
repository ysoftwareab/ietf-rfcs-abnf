3.  Introduction
    
    The GeoPriv working group needs to define requirements on its object
    and any use of this object by protocols.  This memo is an attempt to
    list the minimum set of requirements for the most common uses.  By
    starting with the simplest cases, we can more easily verify that the
    requirements are correct and that security and privacy are properly
    considered.  We can then go on to consider more complex scenarios
    and see if the requirements need to be changed for them.
    
    
4.  Requirements on the GeoPriv Object
    
    *   The object MUST be suitable for requesting and receiving a
        location.
    *   The object MUST contain enough information to allow the
        user/owner's policy to be applied, including decisions such as:
        -   to disclose the location or not
        -   the precision, accuracy, and age of the location
        -   the number of decoy locations
        -   encryption requirements
    *   The object MUST permit (but not require) the policy to be
        enforced by a third party.
    *   The object MUST be usable in a variety of protocols, such as
        HTTP [HTTP] and SIP [SIP], as well as local APIs.
    *   The object MUST be usable in a secure manner even by
        applications on constrained devices.
    *   Encryption and authentication MUST use IETF security protocols.
    *   The object MUST carry location information in a well-known and
        standard format.
    *   The object MUST be extensible.
    *   All attributes of the object MUST have default values.  This
        allows the object to be used in a more compact form, and allows
        interoperability with implementations supporting future extensions.
    *   The default value of each attribute MUST reveal the least
        information.
    
    *   The object SHOULD have attributes which allow the policy
        enforcer to comply with legal or contractual obligations.
    *   The object SHOULD have a catchy acronym; for example Location
        and Security Description (LSD).
    
    
5.  Requirements on Protocols Using the GeoPriv Object
    
    *   Location information MUST be exchanged only in accordance with
        the user/owner's policy, including:
        -   to disclose the location or not
        -   the precision, accuracy, and age of the location
        -   the number of decoy locations
        -   encryption requirements

6.  Usage Models
    
    The model situation is where a device which knows its location wants
    to disclose it on request (for example, during an HTTP session).
    Other situations, such as a requester asking a proxy for the
    location of a target, or where the device doesn't know its location
    but a server does, can be constructed using the model situation as a
    base.
    
    The model situation requires a policy enforcer.  This may reside
    within the device, or externally.
    
    Consider as an example that a web browser on the device is asked its
    location in order to receive a document.
    
    The original HTTP request might or might not use the GeoPriv object.
    
    The web browser on the device might construct a GeoPriv object and
    fill in what it knows (e.g., the host name asking for the
    information, details of the TLS [TLS] layer in effect, etc.), or it
    might verify and extend an object received in the HTTP request.  In
    either case the object does not yet contain the location.
    
    The web browser passes the GeoPriv object to a local or remote
    policy enforcer, which applies the policy, fills in the location as
    appropriate under the policy, and returns a GeoPriv object.
    
    The web browser returns the GeoPriv object to the HTTP server.
    
    Alternatively, the web browser may return an encrypted GeoPriv
    object containing the location to the web server, which must send it
    to the policy enforcer (as specified in the object) in order to use
    the information.
    
    The policy enforcer applies the policy and returns a usable GeoPriv
    object to the web server.
    
    
7.  Security Considerations
    
    Security is a primary concern of the object and any use of it by
    protocols.  Security and privacy are considered throughout this
    document.
