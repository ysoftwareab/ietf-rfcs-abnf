   Abstract 
    
      This document addresses a network side solution of fast handover in 
      Mobile IPv6. Existing FMIPv6 basically assumes the involvement of 
      mobile nodes in handover procedure. However, in some cases, it may not 
      be easy to realize fast handover function into all mobile nodes. In 
      the case, a network operator may want to provide fast handover service         
      to users by using only networks entities. To achieve network side fast 
      handover, this document basically uses bi-directional tunnel between a 
      previous access router and new access router. The proposed fast 
      handover scheme has simpler procedure than the existing FMIPv6 and             
      mostly uses the existing messages.

   1. Motivation 
       
      Mobile IPv6 [3] was developed to support mobility in IPv6 network. 
      Mobile IPv6 can provide service continuity across subnets to mobile 
      nodes (MN) through binding update (BU) to HA/CN. However it was being 
      reported that Mobile IPv6 may have difficulty with supporting real-
      time services because of its latency during handover. Considering the 
      requirements of next generation IP network, the support for the real-
      time services like VoIP would be a crucial requirement. Accordingly 
      some protocols are being suggested to address this problem. 
       
      FMIPv6 [4] is a typical solution to solve the handover latency problem 
      of Mobile IPv6. FMIPv6 realizes the fast handover by using link layer 
      triggers, new CoA pre-configuration, and tunneling. However it is 
      noted that FMIPv6 essentially assumes the involvement of mobile nodes 
      in handover procedure. That is, in FMIPv6, a mobile node should 
      performs several works related to handover such as the awareness of 
      link layer triggers, solicitation of proxy RA, new CoA pre-
      configuration, sending of F-BU to PAR and FNA to NAR as specified in 
      [4]. 
       
      However, in some cases, it may not be easy for network operators to 
      implement the handover function into all mobile nodes in economical or 
      practical way. In this case, it will be very hopeful if we can realize 
      the fast handover by using only network side entities, e.g. PAR and 
      NAR, etc. 
       
      This document provides a solution to support the fast handover by 
      using only network entities as the name of NS-FMIPv6. To achieve it, 
      this document basically uses a bi-directional tunnel between PAR and 
      NAR. This approach is very similar to the post-registration method 
      described in [5] and additionally some schemes considering IPv6 
      characteristics are added. Note that NS-FMIPv6 does not require 
      handover functionalities except those in Mobile IPv6 and optionally 
      op-DAD [6] for mobile nodes. Moreover the procedure of NS-FMIPV6 is 
      much simpler than it of the existing FMIPv6 because it does not 
      require the involvement of MNs. It is expected that the simpler 
      procedure may result in lower handover latency. 
       
    
   2. Terminology 
    
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
       
      This document uses the same terminologies described in the MIPv6 [3] 
      and FMIPv6 [4] documents.

   3. Protocol overview 
    
   3.1 Assumptions 
    
      This document basically assumes followings.  
      - Pre-handover trigger (PRE-HO), which indicates imminent layer 2 
         handover, and link up trigger (LU) are available  
      - Network entities such as PAR and NAR can aware these triggers but 
         MNs may not  
      - Mobile nodes have only the handover functions specified in Mobile 
         IPv6 and optionally optimistic DAD  
      - Collision probability is low enough to use optimistic DAD 
       
      This document also assumes following the same reference architecture 
      as in FMIPV6.

   3.2 Design considerations 
    
      In NS-FMIPv6, the first consideration is to make the handover support 
      to MNs possible even if only Mobile IPv6 and optionally op-DAD are 
      implemented in them. This consideration may be one of important 
      requirements in the deployment aspect for fast handover schemes in 
      Mobile IPv6.  
       
      In FMIPv6, the handover latency of Mobile IPv6 was classified into 
      three main delay factors such as movement detection, CoA configuration 
      and binding update. Basically NS-FMIPv6 follows the approach specified 
      in FMIPv6. However the process regarding CoA configuration is a little 
      different because the process highly requires the involvement of MNs. 
      The considerations on each delay factor in NS-FMIPv6 are described in 
      the followings.  
       
      o Movement detection delay  
      NS-FMIPv6 uses the same approach as FMIPv6. That is, it needs pre-
      handover trigger (PRE-HO), which indicates imminent link layer 
      handover, and link up trigger (LU), which informs the establishment of 
      new link at NAR for quick movement detection. However networks 
      entities aware these trigger but MNs may not.  
       
      o CoA configuration delay  
      NS-FMIPv6 does not support new CoA pre-configuration in order to keep 
      the independency with MNs. Therefore additional schemes may be needed 
      to support fast CoA configuration in NAR.  
       
      o Binding update delay  
      Bi-directional tunnel will be used to prevent service interruption 
      during link change and binding update like specified in FMIPv6. 
      However the HI/HACK messages are a little different from them of the 
      existing FMIPv6 because these messages are used just for the exchange 
      of information of MN and possibly for tunnel establishment.

                            Figure 2: Handover Procedure 
       
       
       
      The descriptions for each step are given as follows.  
       
      (1) PAR receives pre-ho trigger. The trigger indicates that link layer 
          handover of an MN is imminent and includes the link layer address 
          (e.g. MAC address) of the MN and NAR. It is assumed that PAR 
          already has the mapping between link layer address and IP address 
          of the MN and NAR. 
       
      (2) PAR sends HI message to NAR to negotiate bi-directional tunnel 
          with NAR for the MN. The HI message includes link layer address of 
          the MN and previous CoA (PCoA) as specified in FMIPv6.  
       
      (3) NAR replies with HACK which includes the result for bi-directional 
          tunnel negotiation. Also NAR creates host routing entry for the 
          PCoA of the MN. 
       
      (4) If PAR received HACK and its result is successful, it starts 
          forwarding the packet destined to the MN toward NAR.

   Internet Draft        Network Side Fast Handover             June 2005 

      (5) When NAR is informed that new link to the MN is established after 
          the completion of link layer handover through LU trigger, NAR 
          immediately unicasts (or muticasts) RA to the MN. Note that the RA 
          is different from existing fast RA [7] in the point that it is 
          unsolicited router advertisement. The unicast of RA is chosen for 
          air resource efficiency. If an air interface naturally supports 
          broadcast, Multicast RA also can be used. Simultaneously, the NAR 
          deliveries the buffered packet to the MNs using the host entry for 
          the MN. 
       
      (6) If the network is being well managed and the probability of 
          address collision is very low, then the MN can configure new 
          address using the fast RA without DAD procedure. Optionally, Op-
          DAD could be used to enhance the stability of operation.  
       
      (7) After configuring new CoA, the MN performs binding update to HA/CN 
          according to normal Mobile IPv6 procedure. 
       
       
   5. Changes from FMIPv6 
       
      NS-FMIPv6 basically follows the procedures and message formats of 
      FMIPv6. However, several changes are needed to achieve network only 
      solution.  
       
      o Triggering of HI message  
      In FMIPv6, HI message is normally triggered by FBU message. On the 
      other hand, the HI message in NS-FMIPv6 is sent from PAR to NAR if 
      PRE-HO trigger is informed to PAR because it does not assume the 
      triggering message from MNs.  
       
      o Tunneling point in NAR  
      In FMIPv6, the tunnel end point in NAR is NCoA. However, it is noted 
      that NCoA is not pre-configured in NS-FMIPv6. Therefore the end point 
      in NS-FMIPv6 should be changed to NAR. To deliver the packets destine 
      to PCoA, NAR also has to prepare host routing entry for the PCoA in 
      advance.  
       
      o NAR's awareness of attaching of MN  
      In FMIPv6, NAR is aware of attaching of MN by FNA message from the MN. 
      On the other hand, since it is assumed in NS-FMIPv6 that the NAR can  
      quickly recognize the attachment through LU trigger, the NAR sends 
      unsolicited fast RA to the MN.  
       
      o Changed in HI/HACK messages  
      NS-FMIPv6 uses HI/HACK messages only for the information exchange for 
      the moving MN and the tunnel establishment for packet forwarding, not 
      for the verification of pre-configured NCoA. Therefore some minor 
      changes are required in the existing HI/HACK messages.

      - Handover Initiate (HI) message  
      The HI message for NS-FMIPv6 is identical to FMIPv6 HI excepting Code 
      value. The HI for NS-FMIPv6 newly defines a code value of 2 in order 
      for PAR to inform NAR that NS-FMIPv6 is now working.   
       
      Code   
      0: when PAR processes an FBU with PCoA as source IP address.  
      1: when PAR processes an FBU whose source IP address is not PCoA.  
      2: When PAR processes NS-FMIPv6, not pure FMIPv6.  
       
      Also, two flags should be set as follows.  
       
      S: This flag MUST be 0 because HI of NS-FMIPv6 does not include NCoA.   
      U: This flag MUST be 1 in order NAR starts to buffer packets addressed 
          to MN.   
       
      Valid Option:  
      Link-layer address of MN  
      Previous Care of Address  
      New Care of Address (it is not necessary in NS-FMIPv6)   
       
      It might be required that the lifetime of bi-directional tunnel is 
      conveyed by HI, since there is not FBU message in NS-FMIPv6.  
       
      - Handover Acknowledge (HAck)  
      The HAck for NS-FMIPv6 is the same as that of FMIPv6. However the 
      consideration on the following option should be given.  
                              
      Valid Options:  
      New Care of Address (Hack of S-FMIPv6 does not include this option 
      because 'S' bit in HI is not set.) 
       
       
   6. Security Considerations 
       
      The security issues of NS-FMIPv6 are basically in line with it of 
      FMIPv6. Note that the security of NS-FMIPv6 could be simpler than 
      FMIPv6 because it does not need the security consideration over air 
      interface like in FMIPv6. 
       
       
   7. Acknowledgement 
    
      The Authors would like to give special thanks to JungHoon Jee for his 
      valuable comments and discussion for enhancing the NS-FMIPv6.
