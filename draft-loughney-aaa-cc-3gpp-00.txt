Abstract 
    
   This document authorizes IANA to allocate a block of Diameter command 
   codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project Release 5.  This 
   document does not pass judgment on the usage of these command codes.  
   Further more, these command codes are for use for Release 5.  For 
   future releases, these codes cannot be reused, but must be allocated 
   according to the Diameter Base specification.

1. Introduction 
    
   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the 
   Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as part of their Release 5 
   architecture.  As part of this architecture, they have defined a 
   Diameter application [29.229] and [29.329] which requires the use of 
   new Diameter command codes [DIAM]. 
    
1.1 Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2119].

2. Command Code Allocation 
    
   This document authorizes IANA to allocate Diameter Command Codes 300 
   through 313, for use in 3GPP Release 5. The protocols defined by 
   these command codes have not been carefully reviewed by the IETF 
   community and are not considered to be general mechanisms appropriate 
   for broad usage. More work is needed to develop general mechanisms 
   and may become a work item of an IETF Working Group. These command 
   codes are intended to be used for 3GPP Release 5 only [29.228], 
   [29.229].  Future 3GPP releases are expected to make use of alternate 
   mechanisms. 
    
   Command codes for 3GPP Release 6 to be allocated from the standard 
   command space, with IETF documentation. The current intent as agreed 
   with 3GPP is to develop a standards track application addressing the 
   needs of AAA for SIP/SDP and encompassing the requirements of the 
   cellular community. 
    
3. Security Consideration 
    
   This document does not impact the security of the Internet.
