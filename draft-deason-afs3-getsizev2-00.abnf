VOLGETSIZEV2_OMITDIRS = XXX

      This is the GetSizeV2 analogue of the DumpV2 flag
      VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS.  If this flag is set, the volume dump size
      will be calculated for a dump generated by a DumpV2 call where the
      flag VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS was set.  Such a dump does not include
      directory information for the parent directories of any modified
      directory entries, if the modification time for the parent
      directories are earlier than the specified fromDate.
