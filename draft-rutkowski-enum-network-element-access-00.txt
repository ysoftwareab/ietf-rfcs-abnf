 Abstract

   ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefit
   of private users of the Internet.  It makes use of
   authoritative E.164 telephone number data maintained
   among public telecommunication service providers to
   enable some useful value added messaging services on
   the Internet.  Anyone can (and several companies do)
   provide these ENUM services competitively today without
   government involvement or regulation.  Other providers
   can enter the marketplace.
   
   Although one ENUM provisioning option is to denominate
   a particular Internet offering worldwide as "public"
   and "authoritative," there are significant technical,
   operational, and regulatory burdens and costs created
   that make the prospect rather daunting at best.  It is
   also unnecessary.  A more effective alternative is to
   facilitate ENUM service providers' access to authoritative 
   E.164 number and customer information through fair and 
   non-discriminatory contractual arrangements with public 
   telecommunication service providers, and leave the rest 
   to a competitive ENUM provider marketplace and the 
   commercial relationships between Internet Service 
   Providers and public telecommunication carriers.


1. ENUM as an exclusive authoritative PUBLIC service on the Internet

  ITU-T Recommendation E.164 exists for the purpose of coordinating
  the use of Public Telecommunication Services worldwide according
  to typically heavily regulated national provisioning arrangements
  for these services.  The Internet by contrast is a means for
  private users of computers to share resources and effect
  applications among themselves.  Internet uses do not constitute
  Public Telecommunication Services.  Typically in most countries,
  as well as public international law, Internet users and their
  service providers are not subject to substantial regulation.
  
  ENUM is a means for private Internet users to potentially obtain
  some additional enhanced services via the Internet using E.164
  public telecommunication plan numbers.  Some existing Internet
  service providers have begun to offer these ENUM services to
  Internet users.  The ENUM technology, standards, and marketplace
  are constantly changing, and will continue to do so in uncertain
  ways.  It is typically not an arena where government intrusion is
  advisable.
  
  Some parties propose that ITU's Study Group 2 and all of its
  Member States give recognition to and implement an exclusive,
  global, authoritative, public ENUM service.  It is asserted that
  this is necessary to provide individual Internet users with an
  uncomplicated, accurate single service option.  In this
  conjunction, the same parties desire the Telecommunication
  Standardization Bureau be used as a clearinghouse among Member
  States for a private party implementation of the public ENUM
  service.
  
  What such a proposal ignores, however, is the specific, special
  purpose of E.164 numbers for the Public Telecommunication
  Services that are tailored to significantly different national
  provisioning and regulatory requirements in every Member State. 
  Those differences among Member States today are harmonized
  through complex commercial relationships among public
  telecommunication providers worldwide that provide for sharing
  information to effect specific services among the providers. 
  Operationally, there is no hierarchical tree; and today's Public
  Switched Telecommunications Network using the Intelligent Network
  is a testament to how distributed protected databases and
  commercial relationships can provide robust and effective
  capabilities analogous to ENUM.
  
  It also seems dubious that the ITU and all its Member States must
  adopt a single, globally recognized and regulated public ENUM
  schema - based on the premise that individual private Internet
  users will be configuring and maintaining all their complex ENUM
  service and identifier mapping information.  More likely, it will
  be public telecommunication carriers and Internet Service
  Providers providing maintaining the technical configuration
  information based on customer preferences and provider
  contractual relationships - just as it is done today.


2. A Better Approach: Facilitating accurate private ENUM provisioning

                                     |
                                     |_| ENUM Service Providers
                                       | obtain access to Intelligent
                                       | Network E.164 Network Element
                                       | databases on fair and non-
                                       | discriminatory terms

                           Figure 1


  Under current law, policy, and business practices in most
  countries, the Intelligent Network based E.164 Network Element
  databases for Public Telecommunication Services remain
  authoritative.  This is the information resident on the left side
  of the above diagram.  Administrations and Public
  Telecommunication Service providers have an interest in assuring
  to the extent possible, that ENUM service databases on the
  Internet reflect accurately, authoritative E.164 Public
  Telecommunication Service information.
  
   An effective course of action is to facilitate Internet ENUM
  services via a standard interface service whereby all ENUM
  service providers could obtain access to those Network Element
  databases.  The Intelligent Network access interface could be
  provided on fair and non-discriminatory terms that provide for
  proper security, accounting, and consumer protection. This would
  serve as an effective, far less administratively and
  operationally burdensome alternative to a single, exclusive
  Internet "public" DNS ENUM.
  
  This alternative would also allow existing telecommunication
  carriers to provide, if they choose, the ability for customers to
  create ENUM DNS resource records within the Intelligent Network,
  for porting to Internet ENUM services providers using
  Internet-friendly protocols such as SIP. 
  
  Such a result would allow each national administration or region
  to maintain its autonomy and regulatory approaches.  It would
  facilitate the rapid emergence of flexible and dynamic markets in
  Internet-based value-added mapping services beyond just ENUM. 
  Appropriate liaison with Study Group 11 should occur to enable
  this work, to the extent that these interfaces do not already
  exist in Q-series recommendations.


3. ANNEX - E.164 Operational and Policy Frameworks

3.1 Public Telecommunication Networks

  The global framework for numbering for international public
  telecommunication services is currently manifested in ITU-T
  Recommendation E.164.  It came into existence and evolved over
  the past 50 years in conjunction with Q-series signalling
  standards that have grown and evolved to constitute the
  Signalling System 7 based backplane and myriad associated
  Intelligent Network database systems. [1,2]
  
  This E.164 framework allows national administrations to maintain
  independent, autonomous numbering plans that are integrated with
  associated national provisioning and regulatory schema.  For
  example, in some countries such as the USA, E.164 numbers are
  defined by statutory law to constitute Network Elements with
  attendant regulatory and extensive provisioning infrastructures
  that have come into existence and evolved over the past fifteen
  years to encourage open provisioning of E.164 related
  information. [3]
  
  Typically in many countries, the access and use of the databases
  is subject to extensive national and local requirements related
  to competition laws, emergency services, national security,
  lawful interception, and consumer protection.  These requirements
  typically have been put into place over many years through
  extensive public rulemaking proceedings.
  
  This complexity of the E.164 database infrastructure arises in
  large part because these databases are "public" and support
  public telecommunication services.  The use of the term "public"
  and the associated services also has significant implications
  under ITU public international law treaty instruments.
  
  These E-Series and Q-Series Recommendations and their regional
  and national counterparts that have become incorporated into
  telecommunication industry products and services through vast
  deployments of Intelligent Network infrastructure.  This
  infrastructure provides authoritative E.164 based information
  that has high security, reliability, availability, and privacy
  protections, while at the same time providing stable
  business-oriented contractual arrangements among all providers
  concerning use of the shared data.  It has brought a degree of
  innovation and innovation to the public telecommunications
  infrastructure that in some ways rivals that of the Internet. [3]
  
  The providers in the marketplace have relied on customary
  contractual and business arrangements to synchronize and
  authenticate their databases with the authoritative ones resident
  on the SS7 Intelligent Network. 

3.2 The "Private" Internet

  The Internet is substantially different from the public
  telecommunications infrastructure.  It is an open, private shared
  user network based on the TCP/IP protocol where users can
  autonomously share their computer-based resources. [4]  It was
  created and has grown and evolved as an ensemble of largely
  privately provided resources that are autonomously shared among
  what are now hundreds of millions of users.  Unlike the public
  telecommunications networks, the Internet has no universal
  "public" services.
  
  The growth of Internet messaging services, especially IP
  telephony, has produced a demand for gateway services to the
  public telecommunications infrastructure.  Part of that demand
  has included the creation of E.164 based value-added information
  services that borrow data from the existing authoritative
  Intelligent Network E.164 based databases and seek to provide
  additional functionality.
  
  Many different E.164 based Internet value-added services have
  evolved over the past ten years, employing diverse protocols and
  feature sets.  Some make use of the Internet Domain Name System
  (DNS) protocol, and those implementations exist in the
  marketplace worldwide.[5] Typically these Internet telephony
  number mapping services are denominated "ENUM."
  
  Recently, one particular DNS protocol variant has been developed
  as a draft protocol specification by an Internet standards forum
  - the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - as RFC 2916 -
  although it is currently being extensively revised and renamed.
  
  The protocol used in RFC 2916 began to be used by various
  Internet Service Providers globally to provide mapping services
  in various Internet DNS domains.  In addition, the Internet
  Society's Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is seeking to
  denominate a specific ENUM brand as an exclusive "public"
  database offering under the brand name space e164.arpa, and
  obtain the sanction of the ITU and regulatory authorities
  worldwide.


4. Security Considerations

   The existing framework for E.164 numbers as Network Elements
   within the Intelligent Network is highly robust and secure.
