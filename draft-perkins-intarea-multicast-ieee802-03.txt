         Multicast Considerations over IEEE 802 Wireless Media
               draft-perkins-intarea-multicast-ieee802-03

Abstract

   Performance issues have been observed when multicast packet
   transmissions of IETF protocols are used over IEEE 802 wireless
   media.  Even though enhamcements for multicast transmissions have
   been designed at both IETF and IEEE 802, there seems to exist a
   disconnect between specifications, implementations and configuration
   choices.  This draft describes the different issues that have been
   observed, the multicast enhancement features that have been specified
   at IETF and IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as the operational
   chioces that can be taken to improve the performace of the network.
   Finally, it provides some recommendations about the usage and
   combination of these features and operational choices.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2017


1.  Introduction

   Many IETF protocols depend on multicast/broadcast for delivery of
   control messages to multiple receivers.  Multicast is used for
   various purposes such as neighborhood discovery, network flooding,
   address resolution, as well minimizing media occupancy for the
   transmission of data that is intended for multiple receivers.

   IETF protocols typically rely on network protocol layering in order
   to reduce or eliminate any dependence of higher level protocols on
   the specific nature of the MAC layer protocols or the physical media.
   In the case of multicast transmissions, higher level protocols have
   traditionally been designed as if transmitting a packet to an IP
   address had the same cost in interference and network media access,
   regardless of whether the destination IP address is a unicast address
   or a multicast or broadcast address.  This model was reasonable for
   networks where the physical medium was wired, like Ethernet.
   Unfortunately, for many wireless media, the costs to access the
   medium can be quite different.  Some enhancements have been designed
   in IETF protocols that are assumed to work primarily over wireless
   media.  However, these enhancements are usually implemented in
   limited deployments and not widely spread on most wireless networks.

   IEEE 802 wireless protocols have been designed with certain features
   to support multicast traffic.  For instance, lower modulations are
   used to transmit multicast frames, so that these can be received by
   all stations in the cell, regardless of the distance or path
   attenuation from the base station or access point.  However, these
   lower modulation transmissions occupy the medium longer; they hamper
   efficient transmission of traffic using higher order modulations to
   nearby stations.  For these and other reasons, IEEE 802 working
   groups such as 802.11 have designed features to improve the
   performance of multicast transmissions at Layer 2 [REF
   11-15-1261-03].  In addition to protocol design features, certain
   operational and configuration enhancements can ameliorate the network
   performance issues created by multicast traffic.

   This Internet Draft details various problems caused by multicast
   transmission over wireless networks.  It also explains some
   enhancements that have been designed at IETF and IEEE 802, as well as
   the operational choices that can be taken, to ameliorate the effects
   of multicast traffic.  Recommendations about how to use and combine
   these enhancements are also provided.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following definitions:

   AP
      IEEE 802.11 Access Point.

   STA
      802.11 station (e.g. handheld device).

   basic rate
      The "lowest common denominator" data rate at which multicast and
      broadcast traffic is generally transmitted.

   MCS
      Modulation and Coding Scheme.


3.  Identified mulitcast issues

3.1.  Issues at Layer 2 and Below

   In this section we list some of the issues related to the use of
   multicast transmissions over IEEE 802 wireless technologies.

3.1.1.  Multicast reliability

   Multicast traffic is typically much less reliable than unicast
   traffic.  Since multicast makes point-to-multipoint communications,
   multiple acknowledgements would be needed to guarantee the reception
   on all recipients.

3.1.2.  Lower Data Rate

   Because more robust MCSs have longer range but also lower data rate,
   multicast / broadcast traffic is generally transmitted at the lowest
   common denominator rate, also known as the basic rate.  On IEEE
   802.11 networks (aka WiFi), this rate might be as low as 6 Mbps, when
   some unicast links in the same cell can be operating at rates up to
   600 Mbps.  Transmissions at a lower rate require longer occupancy of
   the wireless medium and thus take away from the airtime of other
   communications and degrade the overall capacity.

   Wired multicast also affects wireless LANs when the AP extends the
   wired segment; in that case, multicast / broadcast frames on the
   wired LAN side are copied to WLAN.  Since broadcast messages are
   transmitted at the most robust MCS, many large frames are sent at a
   slow rate over the air.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2017


3.1.3.  Power-save Effects on Multicast

   Multicast can work poorly with the power-save mechanisms defined in
   IEEE 802.11.

   o  Both unicast and multicast traffic can be delayed by power-saving
      mechanisms.
   o  A unicast packet is delayed until a STA wakes up and requests it.
      Unicast traffic may also be delayed to improve power save,
      efficiency and increase probability of aggregation.
   o  Multicast traffic is delayed in a wireless network if any of the
      STAs in that network are power savers.  All STAs associated to the
      AP have to be awake at a known time to receive multicast traffic.
   o  Packets can also be discarded due to buffer limitations in the AP
      and non-AP STA.

3.2.  Issues at Layer 3 and Above

   This section identifies some representative IETF protocols, and
   describes possible negative effects due to performance degradation
   when using multicast transmissions for control messages.  Common uses
   of multicast include:

   o  Control plane for IPv4 and IPv6
   o  ARP and Neighbor Discovery
   o  Service discovery
   o  Applications (video delivery, stock data etc)
   o  Other L3 protocols (non-IP)

3.2.1.  IPv4 issues

   The following list contains a few representative IPv4 protocols using
   multicast.

   o  ARP
   o  DHCP
   o  mDNS

   After initial configuration, ARP and DHCP occur much less commonly.

3.2.2.  IPv6 issues

   IPv6 makes much more extensive use of multicast, including the
   following:

   o  DHCPv6
   o  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is not very tolerant of
      packet losses.  In particular, the Duplicate Address Detection



Perkins, et al.         Expires January 20, 2018                [Page 5]

      (DAD) process fails when the owner of an address does not receive
      the multicast DAD message from another node that wishes to own
      that same address.  This can result in an address being duplicated
      in the subnet, breaking a basic assumption of IPv6 connectivity.
   o  IPv6 NDP Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages used in DAD and
      Address Lookup make use of Link-Scope multicast.  In contrast to
      IPv4, an IPv6 Node will typically use multiple addresses, and may
      change them often for privacy reasons.  This multiplies the impact
      of multicast messages that are associated to the mobility of a
      Node.  Router advertisement (RA) messages are also periodically
      multicasted over the Link.
   o  Neighbors may be considered lost if several consecutive packets
      fail.

   Address Resolution

   Service Discovery

   Route Discovery

   Decentralized Address Assignment

   Geographic routing

3.2.3.  MLD issues

   Multicast Listener Discovery(MLD) [RFC4541] is often used to identify
   members of a multicast group that are connected to the ports of a
   switch.  Forwarding multicast frames into a WiFi-enabled area can use
   such switch support for hardware forwarding state information.
   However, since IPv6 makes heavy use of multicast, each STA with an
   IPv6 address will require state on the switch for several and
   possibly many multicast solicited-node addresses.  Multicast
   addresses that do not have forwarding state installed (perhaps due to
   hardware memory limitations on the switch) cause frames to be flooded
   on all ports of the switch.

3.2.4.  Spurious Neighbor Discovery

   On the Internet there is a "background radiation" of scanning traffic
   (people scanning for vulnerable machines) and backscatter (responses
   from spoofed traffic, etc).  This means that routers very often
   receive packets destined for machines whose IP addresses may or may
   not be in use.  In the cases where the IP is assigned to a host, the
   router broadcasts an ARP request, gets back an ARP reply, and caches
   it; then traffic can be delivered to the host.  When the IP address
   is not in use, the router broadcasts one (or more) ARP requests, and
   never gets a reply.  This means that it does not populate the ARP

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2017


   cache, and the next time there is traffic for that IP address the
   router will rebroadcast the ARP requests.

   The rate of these ARP requests is proportional to the size of the
   subnets, the rate of scanning and backscatter, and how long the
   router keeps state on non-responding ARPs.  As it turns out, this
   rate is inversely proportional to how occupied the subnet is (valid
   ARPs end up in a cache, stopping the broadcasting; unused IPs never
   respond, and so cause more broadcasts).  Depending on the address
   space in use, the time of day, how occupied the subnet is, and other
   unknown factors, on the order of 2000 broadcasts per second have been
   observed at the IETF NOCs.

   On a wired network, there is not a huge difference amongst unicast,
   multicast and broadcast traffic; but this is not true in the wireless
   realm.  Wireless equipment often is unable to send this amount of
   broadcast and multicast traffic.  Consequently, on the wireless
   networks, we observe a significant amount of dropped broadcast and
   multicast packets.  This, in turn, means that when a host connects it
   is often not able to complete DHCP, and IPv6 RAs get dropped, leading
   to users being unable to use the network.

4.  Multicast protocol optimizations

   This section lists some optimizations that have been specified in
   IEEE 802 and IETF that are aimed at reducing or eliminating the
   issues discussed in Section 3.

4.1.  Proxy ARP in 802.11-2012

   The AP knows the MAC address and IP address for all associated STAs.
   In this way, the AP acts as the central "manager" for all the 802.11
   STAs in its BSS.  Proxy ARP is easy to implement at the AP, and
   offers the following advantages:

   o  Reduced broadcast traffic (transmitted at low MCS) on the wireless
      medium
   o  STA benefits from extended power save in sleep mode, as ARP
      requests for STA's IP address are handled instead by the AP.
   o  ARP frames are kept off the wireless medium.
   o  No changes are needed to STA implementation.

   Here is the specification language as described in clause 10.23.13 of
   [dot11-proxyarp]:

      When the AP supports Proxy ARP "[...] the AP shall maintain a
      Hardware Address to Internet Address mapping for each associated
      station, and shall update the mapping when the Internet Address of



Perkins, et al.         Expires January 20, 2018                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2017


      the associated station changes.  When the IPv4 address being
      resolved in the ARP request packet is used by a non-AP STA
      currently associated to the BSS, the proxy ARP service shall
      respond on behalf of the non-AP STA"

4.2.  IPv6 Address Registration and Proxy Neighbor Discovery

   As used in this section, a Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network
   (6LoWPAN) denotes a low power lossy network (LLN) that supports
   6LoWPAN Header Compression (HC) [RFC6282].  A 6TiSCH network
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] is an example of a 6LowPAN.  In order
   to control the use of IPv6 multicast over 6LoWPANs, the 6LoWPAN
   Neighbor Discovery (6LoWPAN ND) [RFC6775] standard defines an address
   registration mechanism that relies on a central registry to assess
   address uniqueness, as a substitute to the inefficient Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) mechanism found in the mainstream IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861][RFC4862].

   The 6lo Working Group is now completing an update
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update] to RFC6775.  The update enables the
   registration to a Backbone Router [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router],
   which proxies for the registered addresses with the mainstream IPv6
   NDP running on a high speed aggragating backbone.  The update also
   enables a proxy registration on behalf of the registered node, e.g.
   by a 6LoWPAN router to which the mobile node is attached.

   The general idea behind the backbone router concept is that in a
   variety of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless Personal
   Area Networks (WPANs), the broadcast/multicast domain should be
   controlled, and connectivity to a particular link that provides the
   subnet should be left to Layer-3.  The model for the Backbone Router
   operation is represented in Figure 1.

               Figure 1: Backbone Link and Backbone Routers

   LLN nodes can move freely from an LLN anchored at one IPv6 Backbone
   Router to an LLN anchored at another Backbone Router on the same
   backbone, keeping any of the IPv6 addresses they have configured.
   The Backbone Routers maintain a Binding Table of their Registered
   Nodes, which serves as a distributed database of all the LLN Nodes.
   An extension to the Neighbor Discovery Protocol is introduced to
   exchange that information across the Backbone Link in the reactive
   fashion of mainstream IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.

   RFC6775 and follow-on work are designed to address the needs of LLNs,
   but the techniques are likely to be valuable on any type of link
   where sleeping devices are attached, or where the use of broadcast
   and multicast operations should be limited.

4.3.  Buffering to improve Power-Save

   The AP acts on behalf of STAs in various ways.  In order to improve
   the power-saving feature for STAs in its BSS, the AP buffers frames
   for delivery to the STA at the time when the STA is scheduled for
   reception.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2017


4.4.  IPv6 support in 802.11-2012

   IPv6 uses Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) instead of ARP.  Every
   IPv6 node subscribes to a special multicast address for this purpose.

   Here is the specification language from clause 10.23.13 of
   [dot11-proxyarp]:

      "When an IPv6 address is being resolved, the Proxy Neighbor
      Discovery service shall respond with a Neighbor Advertisement
      message [...] on behalf of an associated STA to an [ICMPv6]
      Neighbor Solicitation message [...].  When MAC address mappings
      change, the AP may send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement
      Messages on behalf of a STA."

   NDP may be used to request additional information

   o  Maximum Transmission Unit
   o  Router Solicitation
   o  Router Advertisement, etc.

   NDP messages are sent as group addressed (broadcast) frames in
   802.11.  Using the proxy operation helps to keep NDP messages off the
   wireless medium.

4.5.  Conversion of multicast to unicast

   It is often possible to transmit multicast control and data messages
   by using unicast transmissions to each station individually.

4.6.  Directed Multicast Service (DMS)

   There are situations where more is needed than simply converting
   multicast to unicast.  For these purposes, DMS enables a client to
   request that the AP transmit multicast group addressed frames
   destined to the requesting clients as individually addressed frames
   [i.e., convert multicast to unicast].  Here are some characteristics
   of DMS:

   o  Requires 802.11n A-MSDUs
   o  Individually addressed frames are acknowledged and are buffered
      for power save clients
   o  The requesting STA may specify traffic characteristics for DMS
      traffic
   o  DMS was defined in IEEE Std 802.11v-2011
   o  DMS requires changes to both AP and STA implementation.

   DMS is not currently implemented in products.

4.7.  GroupCast with Retries (GCR)

   GCR (defined in [dot11aa]) provides greater reliability by using
   either unsolicited retries or a block acknowledgement mechanism.  GCR
   increases probability of broadcast frame reception success, but still
   does not guarantee success.

   For the block acknowledgement mechanism, the AP transmits each group
   addressed frame as conventional group addressed transmission.
   Retransmissions are group addressed, but hidden from non-11aa
   clients.  A directed block acknowledgement scheme is used to harvest
   reception status from receivers; retransmissions are based upon these
   responses.

   GCR is suitable for all group sizes including medium to large groups.
   As the number of devices in the group increases, GCR can send block
   acknowledgement requests to only a small subset of the group.  GCR
   does require changes to both AP and STA implementation.

   GCR may introduce unacceptable latency.  After sending a group of
   data frames to the group, the AP has do the following:

   o  unicast a Block Ack Request (BAR) to a subset of members.
   o  wait for the corresponding Block Ack (BA).
   o  retransmit any missed frames.
   o  resume other operations which may have been delayed.

   This latency may not be acceptable for some traffic.

   There are ongoing extensions in 802.11 to improve GCR performance.

   o  BAR is sent using downlink MU-MIMO (note that downlink MU-MIMO is
      already specified in 802.11-REVmc 4.3).
   o  BA is sent using uplink MU-MIMO (which is a .11ax feature).
   o  Additional 802.11ax extensions are under consideration; see
      [mc-ack-mux]
   o  Latency may also be reduced by simultaneously receiving BA
      information from multiple clients.

5.1.  Mitigating Problems from Spurious Neighbor Discovery

   ARP Sponges

         An ARP Sponge sits on a network and learn which IPs addresses
         are actually in use.  It also listen for ARP requests, and, if
         it sees an ARP for an IP address which it believes is not used,
         it will reply with its own MAC address.  This means that the
         router now has an IP to MAC mapping, which it caches.  If that
         IP is later assigned to an machine (e.g using DHCP), the ARP
         sponge will see this, and will stop replying for that address.
         Gratuitous ARPs (or the machine ARPing for its gateway) will
         replace the sponged address in the router ARP table.  This
         technique is quite effective; but, unfortunately, the ARP
         sponge daemons were not really designed for this use (the
         standard one [arpsponge], was designed to deal with the
         disappearance of participants from an IXP) and so are not
         optimized for this purpose.  We have to run one daemon per
         subnet, the tuning is tricky (the scanning rate versus the
         population rate versus retires, etc.) and sometimes the daemons
         just seem to stop, requiring a restart of the daemon and
         causing disruption.

   Router mitigations

         Some routers (often those based on Linux) implement a "negative
         ARP cache" daemon.  Simply put, if the router does not see a
         reply to an ARP it can be configured to cache this information
         for some interval.  Unfortunately, the core routers which we
         are using do not support this.  When a host connects to network
         and gets an IP address, it will ARP for its default gateway
         (the router).  The router will update its cache with the IP to
         host MAC mapping learnt from the request (passive ARP
         learning).

   Firewall unused space

         The distribution of users on wireless networks / subnets
         changes from meeting to meeting (e.g the "IETF-secure" SSID was
         renamed to "IETF", fewer users use "IETF-legacy", etc).  This
         utilization is difficult to predict ahead of time, but we can
         monitor the usage as attendees use the different networks.  By
         configuring multiple DHCP pools per subnet, and enabling them
         sequentially, we can have a large subnet, but only assign
         addresses from the lower portions of it.  This means that we
         can apply input IP access lists, which deny traffic to the
         upper, unused portions.  This means that the router does not
         attempt to forward packets to the unused portions of the

         subnets, and so does not ARP for it.  This method has proven to
         be very effective, but is somewhat of a blunt axe, is fairly
         labor intensive, and requires coordination.

   Disabling/filtering ARP requests

         In general, the router does not need to ARP for hosts; when a
         host connects, the router can learn the IP to MAC mapping from
         the ARP request sent by that host.  This means that we should
         be able to disable and / or filter ARP requests from the
         router.  Unfortunately, ARP is a very low level / fundamental
         part of the IP stack, and is often offloaded from the normal
         control plane.  While many routers can filter layer-2 traffic,
         this is usually implemented as an input filter and / or has
         limited ability to filter output broadcast traffic.  This means
         that the simple "just disable ARP or filter it outbound" seems
         like a really simple (and obvious) solution, but
         implementations / architectural issues make this difficult or
         awkward in practice.

   NAT

         The broadcasts are overwhelmingly being caused by outside
         scanning / backscatter traffic.  This means that, if we were to
         NAT the entire (or a large portion) of the attendee networks,
         there would be no NAT translation entries for unused addresses,
         and so the router would never ARP for them.  The IETF NOC has
         discussed NATing the entire (or large portions) attendee
         address space, but a: elegance and b: flaming torches and
         pitchfork concerns means we have not attempted this yet.

   Stateful firewalls

         Another obvious solution would be to put a stateful firewall
         between the wireless network and the Internet.  This firewall
         would block incoming traffic not associated with an outbound
         request.  The IETF philosophy has been to have the network as
         open as possible / honor the end-to-end principle.  An attendee
         on the meeting network should be an Internet host, and should
         be able to receive unsolicited requests.  Unfortunately,
         keeping the network working and stable is the first priority
         and a stateful firewall may be required in order to achieve
         this.

6.  Multicast Considerations for Other Wireless Media

   Many of the causes of performance degradation described in earlier
   sections are also observable for wireless media other than 802.11.

   For instance, problems with power save, excess media occupancy, and
   poor reliability will also affect 802.15.3 and 802.15.4.  However,
   802.15 media specifications do not include mechanisms similar to
   those developed for 802.11.  In fact, the design philosophy for
   802.15 is oriented towards minimality, with the result that many such
   functions would more likely be relegated to operation within higher
   layer protocols.  This leads to a patchwork of non-interoperable and
   vendor-specific solutions.  See [uli] for some additional discussion,
   and a proposal for a task group to resolve similar issues, in which
   the multicast problems might be considered for mitigation.

7.  Recommendations

   This section provides some recommendations about the usage and
   combinations of the multicast enhancements described in Section 4 and
   Section 5.
