               Segment Routing for Redundancy Protection
             draft-geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection-01

Abstract

   Redundancy protection is one of the mechanisms to achieve service
   protection, following the principle of PREOF (Packet
   Replication/Elimination/Ordering Function).  To empower the Segment
   Routing with the capability of redundancy protection, two types of
   Segment including Redundancy Segment and Merging Segment are
   introduced.  The instantiation of Redundancy and Merging Segments can
   be applied to both segment routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) and segment
   routing over IPv6 (SRv6).

1.  Introduction

   Service protection defined in [RFC8655] is initially required from
   the use cases in a variety of industries described in [RFC8578].
   Together with other two techniques Resource allocation and Explicit
   routes, it targets to provide the deterministic flow transmission.
   Meanwhile, with the emerge of Cloud VR, Cloud Game, High-Definition
   Video applications running in the Internet, SLA (Service Level
   Agreement) guarantee becomes an important issue which requires new
   technologies and solutions for network.

Internet-Draft draft-geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection  February 2021


   Redundancy Protection is one of the mechanisms to achieve service
   protection, following the principle of PREOF (Packet Replication/
   Elimination/Ordering Function) defined in [RFC8655].  Specifically,
   replicates the packets of flows into two or more copies, transports
   different copies through different paths in parallel, eliminates and
   orders the packets at end to provide redundancy protection.

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
   called "segments".  A segment can be associated to an arbitrary
   processing of the packet in the node identified by the segment.

   This document extends the capabilities in SR paradigm to support the
   redundancy protection, including the definitions of new Segments and
   a variation of Segment Routing Policy.  The new mechanism applies
   equally to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and
   segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] and[RFC2119].

   Redundancy Node: the start point of redundancy protection, which is a
   network device that could implement packet replication.

   Merging Node: the end point of redundancy protection, which is a
   network node that could implement packet elimination and ordering
   (optionally).

   Redundancy Policy: an extended SR policy which includes more than one
   active segment lists to support redundancy protection.

   Flow Identification: information in SR data service to indicate one
   flow.

   Sequence Number: information in SR data service to indicate the
   packet sequence of one flow.

   Editor's Note: Similar mechanism is defined as "Service Protection"
   in the [RFC8655].  In this document, we define a new term "Redundancy
   Protection" to distinguish with other service protection method.
   Some of the terms are similar as [RFC8655].

   Figure 1: Example Scenario of Redundancy Protection in SR Domain

   This figure shows an example of redundancy protection used in SR
   domain.  When a flow is sent into SR domain, the process is:

   1) R1 receives the traffic flow and encapsulates packets with a list
   of segments, which is instantiated as a stack of MPLS labels or an
   ordered list of SRv6 SIDs.  The final destination of packets is R2.
   R1, R2, R3, R4, Red and Mer are SR-capable nodes.

   2) When the packet flow arrives in Red node, known as Redundancy
   Node, one flow is replicated into two copies.  Each copy of flow is
   encapsulated with different newly-defined list of SIDs, and the last
   SID is always pointed to the SID of Mer node, known as Merging Node.

   3) Packet is encapsulated with the information of flow identification
   and sequence number.  Flow identification identifies the specific
   flow, and sequence number distinguishes the packet sequence of a
   flow.

   4) When the original flow and replicated flow go through different
   paths till Mer node, the first received packet of the flow is
   transmitted from Merging Node to R2, and the redundant packets are
   eliminated.

   5) When there is any failures happened in one path, the service
   continues to deliver through the other path without break.

   6) Sometimes, the packet will arrive out of order because of
   redundancy protection, the function of reordering may be necessary in
   the Merging Node.

   In this example, service protection is supported by utilizing two
   packet flows transmitted over two forwarding paths.  For a
   unidirectional flow, Red node supports replication function, and Mer
   node supports elimination and ordering functions.

4.  Segment to Support Redundancy Protection

   To achieve the Packet Replication/Elimination/Ordering Function,
   Redundancy Segment and Merging Segment are introduced.

4.1.  Redundancy Segment

   Redundancy Segment is associated with a Redundancy Policy on
   redundancy node.  Redundancy segment is instantiated with service
   instructions, indicating the following operations:

   o  Steering the packet into the corresponding redundancy policy

   o  Packet replication and encapsulation based on the redundancy
      policy, e.g., the number of replication copies

   o  Encapsulate the packet with necessary meta data (e.g., flow
      identification, sequence number) if it is not included in the
      original packet

4.1.1.  SR over MPLS

   In the case of SR over MPLS, when the Active Segment is a redundancy
   segment, a redundancy policy is associated.  According to the
   information of candidate paths in redundancy policy, packets are
   replicated and a CONTINUE operation is applied.  Incoming redundancy
   segment is swapped with different Adj-SIDs to forward the packet in
   different paths.

4.1.2.  SRv6

   In the case of SRv6, a new behavior End.R for redundancy segment is
   defined.

   When an SRv6-capable node (N) receives an IPv6 packet whose
   destination address matches a local IPv6 address instantiated as an
   SRv6 SID (S), and S is a Redundancy SID, N does:

Internet-Draft draft-geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection  February 2021


S01.  When an SRH is processed {
S02.     If (Segments Left>0)   {
S03.          Create two headers IPv6+SRH-1 and IPv6+SRH-2
S04.          Insert different policy-instructed segment lists into SRH-1 and SRH-2
S05.          Add flow identification and sequence number to SRH-1 and SRH-2
S06.          Remove the incoming outer IPv6+SRH header
S07.          Create a duplication of the incoming packet payload
S08.          Encapsulate the original packet with IPv6+SRH-1 header
S09.          Encapsulate the duplicate packet with IPv6+SRH-2 header
S10.          Set IPv6 SA as the local address of this node
S11.          Set IPv6 DA of IPv6+SRH-1 to the first segment of SRv6 Policy in SRH-1 segment list
S12.          Set IPv6 DA of IPv6+SRH-2 to the first segment of SRv6 Policy in SRH-2 segment list
S13.     }
S14.     ELSE {
S15.          Drop the packet
S16.     }

   Note that, redundancy node decapsulates the original IPv6 and SRH
   header, and encapsulates another newly created IPv6 and SRH header to
   the packet payload.  In this case, it would not bring extra header
   insertion risk to IPv6.

4.2.  Alternative Option of Redundancy Segment

   Redundancy segment can also be a variation of Binding SID (BSID).
   Different paths between redundancy node and merging node can be
   encapsulated or inserted by using the End.B6.Encaps and End.B6.Insert
   behavior of BSID.  In this way, headend can have a complete segment
   list in SRH to indicate the path from R1 to R2 in Figure 1.  Take
   End.B6.Encaps as an example.  The behavior of redundancy segment
   includes replicating packets into different copies, pushing new IPv6
   and SRH header to packets, and newly adding or copying the
   information like flow identification and sequence number from
   original packet.  By using the BSID and End.B6.Encaps behavior, the
   IPv6 header insertion issue can be avoided too.

4.3.  Merging Segment

   Merging Segment is associated with service instructions, indicates
   the following operations:

   o  Packet merging and elimination: forward the first received packets
      and eliminate the redundant packets

   o  Packet ordering(optional): reorder the packets if the packet
      arrives out of order

Internet-Draft draft-geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection  February 2021


4.3.1.  SR over MPLS

   In the case of SR over MPLS, when the Active Segment is a Merging
   Segment and this packet is not a redundant packet, a CONTINUE
   operation is applied.  Incoming merging segment is swapped with
   Prefix-SID of destination address.  The redundancy of packets is
   determined by other techniques, and is not within the scope of this
   document.

4.3.2.  SRv6

   In the case of SRv6, a new behavior End.M for Merging Segment is
   defined.

   When an SRv6-capable node (N) receives an IPv6 packet whose
   destination address matches a local IPv6 address instantiated as an
   SRv6 SID (S), and S is a Merging SID, N does:

S01.  When an SRH is processed {
S02.     If (Segments Left>0)   {
S03.          Acquire the sequence number of received packet and lookup it in a local table
S04.             If (the sequence number is not existed in table ) {
S05.                   Store the packet and record the sequence number in table
S06.                   Decrement IPv6 Hop Limit by 1
S07.                   Decrement Segments Left by 1
S08.                   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Segments Left]
S09.                   Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and transmit
S10.             }
S11.             ELSE {
S12.                   Drop the packet
S13.             }
S14.      }
S15.  }

5.  Meta Data to Support Redundancy Protection

   To support the redundancy protection function, Flow Identification
   and Sequence Number are required.  Flow identification identifies the
   specific flow with target of redundancy protection.  Sequence number
   distinguishes the packets within a flow by specifying the order of
   packets.  The information is carried in the service packets along the
   different paths to merging node.  Merging node removes flow
   identifier and sequence number once the elimination and ordering is
   accomplished.  Flow identification and sequence number can be defined
   as MPLS label in SR over MPLS data plane, or is extended in SRH in
   SRv6 data plane.  In case of SRv6,
   [I-D.geng-6man-redundancy-protection-srh] specifies the options of
   supporting flow identification and sequence number on SRH extensions.

Internet-Draft draft-geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection  February 2021


   Note that, the flow identification and sequence number can be added
   either at the headend of the path, or at the redundancy node.  In the
   former case, the information is managed and assigned from the SDN
   controller, and carried in the packet along the entire forwarding
   path in SR domain.  In the latter case, redundancy node assigns the
   values of flow identification and sequence number itself, and this
   information is only used between redundancy node and merging node.

6.  Segment Routing Policy to Support Redundancy Protection

   Redundancy Policy is a variation of SR Policy, and is identified
   through the tuple <redundancy node, redundancy ID, merging node>.
   Redundancy node is specified as IPv4/IPv6 address of the headend,
   which is able to do packet replication.  Merging node is specified as
   IPv4/IPv6 address of the endpoint, which is able to do packet
   elimination and ordering (optional).  Redundancy ID could be a
   specified value of "color" define in section 2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], which indicates the SR
   policy as a redundancy policy.  Redundancy ID could also be used to
   distinguish different redundancy policies sharing the same redundancy
   node and merging node.

   Redundancy Policy extends SR policy to include more than one ordered
   lists of segments between redundancy node and merging node to steer
   the same flow through different paths in SR domain.  In Redundancy
   Policy, Redundancy Segment MUST be specified, and the last segment of
   each ordered list of segments SHOULD be Merging Segment.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires registration of End.R behavior and End.M
   behavior in "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors" sub-registry of "Segment
   Routing Parameters" registry.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD
