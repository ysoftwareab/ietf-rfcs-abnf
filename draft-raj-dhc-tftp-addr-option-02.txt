Internet-Draft       TFTP Server Address DHCP Option          April 2007


Abstract

   This memo defines a new DHCP option for passing the TFTP Server IP
   address information between the DHCP client and the DHCP server.  The
   option number currently in use is 150.  This memo documents the
   current usage of the option in agreement with [6] , which declares
   that any pre-existing usages of option numbers in the range 128 - 223
   should be documented and the working group will try to officially
   assign those numbers to those options.

Internet-Draft       TFTP Server Address DHCP Option          April 2007


1.  Introduction

   Small devices, such as IP phones, have a need for downloading their
   configuration from a TFTP server on the network.  There are commonly
   accepted methods to discover this server via DHCP; the "sname" field
   in the DHCP header [2] , the "TFTP Server name" option (#66) [3] .
   Both of these sources of information, however, contain the TFTP
   server's hostname.  That hostname must then be translated to an IP
   address.  The usual method to accomplish this would be DNS. [4] This
   means the firmware in a small "network appliance" device would need
   to implement the DNS protocol in order to perform this translation.
   This unacceptably increases the firmware code size.

   In order to keep the firmware in a small "network appliance" to a
   minimum, it was decided that it would be best to introduce the "TFTP
   Server Address" option (150).  This option allows the DHCP server to
   pass the IP address of the TFTP server instead of the hostname, thus
   making the information directly usable by the "network appliance".

   In cases where both "sname" or "TFTP Server name" appear in a DHCP
   response packet along with the "TFTP Server address" option in the
   same packet, it is left to the device to decide which piece of
   information to use.

Internet-Draft       TFTP Server Address DHCP Option          April 2007


3.  TFTP Server Address Option Definition

   The TFTP Server Address option is a DHCP option [3].  The option
   contains the IPv4 address of the TFTP server which the client should
   use (if needed).

   The format of the option is:

    Code   Len   IPv4 TFTP Server Address(es)
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   | 150 |  n  |     IPv4 address      | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


                                 Figure 1

   The option minimum length (n) is 4.

   The "Len" field must specify a length which is an integral multiple
   of 4 octets (4, 8, 12, etc.).  If an option is received where this is
   not the case, the option information SHOULD be ignored.  Dividing
   this "Len" value by 4 will give number of IPv4 TFTP server addresses
   which are specified in the option.

   The option SHOULD NOT be specified by the DHCP Client.

   Server addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference.

4.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCP Server could use this option in order to coerce a Client
   into downloading configuration from an alternate TFTP and thus gain
   control of the device's configuration.  This is easier done with the
   TFTP Server Address option than it was with the TFTP Server Name
   option, because in the later case the attack would need to control
   DNS responses as well as inserting the rogue DHCP option information.
   If this may be a concern, then either DHCP Authentication may be
   used, or simply make use of the TFTP Server Name option instead.

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in [5].
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification in [2].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign option number 150 for this option, in
   accordance with [6].  Option 150 has been used for this option.
