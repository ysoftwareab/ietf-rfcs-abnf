    OSPF-TE Link Availability Extension for Links with Variable Discrete

            draft-ietf-ccamp-ospf-availability-extension-05.txt 


Abstract 

   A network may contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g., 
   copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such links may change 
   discretely in reaction to changing external environment. 
   Availability is typically used for describing such links during 
   network planning. This document introduces an optional ISCD 
   Availability sub-TLV to extend the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) as defined in 
   [RFC4203]. This extension can be used for route computation in a 
   network that contains links with variable discrete bandwidth.

1. Introduction 

   Some data communication technologies, e.g., microwave, and copper,   
   allow seamless change of maximum physical bandwidth through a set of 
   known discrete values. The parameter availability [G.827], [F.1703], 
   [P.530] is often used to describe the link capacity during network 
   planning. The availability is a time scale, which is a proportion of 
   the operating time that the requested bandwidth is ensured. 
   Assigning different availability classes to different types of 
   service over such kind of links provides more efficient planning of 
   link capacity. To set up an LSP across these links, availability 
   information is required for the nodes to verify bandwidth 
   satisfaction and make bandwidth reservation. The availability 
   information should be inherited from the availability requirements 
   of the services expected to be carried on the LSP. For example, 
   voice service usually needs "five nines" availability, while non-
   real time services may adequately perform at four or three nines 
   availability. Since different service types may need different 
   availabilities guarantees, multiple <availability, bandwidth> pairs 
   may be required when signaling. The signaling extension for links 
   with discrete bandwidth is defined in [ETPAI]. 

   For the route computation, the availability information should be 
   provided along with bandwidth resource information. In this document, 
   an extension on Interface Switching Capacity Descriptor (ISCD) 
   [RFC4202] for availability information is defined. The extension 
   reuses the reserved field in the ISCD and also introduces an 
   optional Availability sub-TLV.

2. Overview 

   A node which has link(s) with variable bandwidth attached should 
   include a <bandwidth, availability> information list in its OSPF TE 
   LSA messages. The list provides the mapping between the link nominal 
   bandwidth and its availability level. This information is used for 
   path calculation by the node(s).The setup of a Label Switched Path 
   requires this piece of information to be flooded in the network and 
   used by the nodes or the PCE for the path computation. The computed 
   path can then be provisioned via the signaling protocol. 

   For links with variable discrete bandwidth, Availability information 
   is needed to be carried by the signaling for a better link bandwidth 
   utilization. Extensions to RSVP-TE can be found in [ETPAI]. 

3. Extension to OSPF-TE 

3.1. ISCD Availability sub-TLV 

   The ISCD sub-TLV is defined in Section 1.4 of [RFC4203]. The ISCD 
   Availability sub-TLV is defined in this document as a sub-TLV of 
   ISCD. The Switching Capability specific information field of ISCD 
   MAY include one or more ISCD Availability sub-TLV(s). The ISCD 
   Availability sub-TLV has the following format: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |               Type            |               Length          | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                   Availability level                          | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                   LSP Bandwidth at Availability level n       | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
      Type: TBA by IANA, suggested value is 0x01, 16 bits; 

      Length: A 16 bits field that expresses the length of the TLV in 
    bytes; 

       Availability level: 32 bits 

           This field is a 32-bit IEEE floating point number which 
           describes the decimal value of availability guarantee of the 
           switching capacity in the ISCD object which has the AI value 
           equal to Index of this sub-TLV. The value MUST be less than

           1. The Availability level is usually expressed in the value 
           of 0.99/0.999/0.9999/0.99999. 

       LSP Bandwidth at Availability level n: 32 bits 

           This field is a 32-bit IEEE floating point number which 
           describes the LSP Bandwidth at a certain Availability level 
           which was described in the Availability field. The units are 
           bytes per second.  

3.2. Processing Procedures  

   A node which has link(s) with variable bandwidth attached SHOULD 
   contain one or more ISCD Availability sub-TLVs in its OSPF TE LSA 
   messages. Each ISCD Availability sub-TLV provides the information 
   about how much bandwidth a link can support for a specified 
   availability. This information SHOULD be used for path calculation 
   by the node(s).  

   A node that doesn't support ISCD Availability sub-TLV SHOULD ignore 
   ISCD Availability sub-TLV. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document extends [RFC4203].  As with [RFC4203], it specifies 
   the contents of Opaque LSAs in OSPFv2.  As Opaque LSAs are not used 
   for Shortest Path First (SPF) computation or normal routing, the 
   extensions specified here have no direct effect on IP routing. 
   Tampering with GMPLS TE LSAs may have an effect on the underlying 
   transport (optical and/or Synchronous Optical Network - Synchronous 
   Digital Hierarchy (SONET-SDH)) network.  [RFC3630] notes that the 
   security mechanisms described in [RFC2328] apply to Opaque LSAs 
   carried in OSPFv2.  An analysis of the security of OSPF is provided 
   in [RFC6863] and applies to the extensions to OSPF as described in 
   this document.  Any new mechanisms developed to protect the 
   transmission of information carried in Opaque LSAs will also 
   automatically protect the extensions defined in this document. 

   Please refer to [RFC5920] for details on security threats; defensive 
   techniques; monitoring, detection, and reporting of security attacks; 
   and requirements.

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document introduces an Availability sub-TLV of the ISCD sub-TLV 
   of the TE Link TLV in the TE Opaque LSA for OSPF v2. IANA will 
   created and maintain a new sub-registry, the "Types for sub-TLV of 
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor" registry under the "Open 
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) Traffic Engineering TLVs" registry, see 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ospf-traffic-eng-tlvs. 

   This document proposes a suggested value for the Availability sub-
   TLV; it is recommended that the suggested value be granted by IANA.
