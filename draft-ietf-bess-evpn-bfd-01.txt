Abstract

   This document specifies proactive, in-band network OAM mechanisms to
   detect loss of continuity and miss-connection faults that affect
   unicast and multi-destination paths (used by Broadcast, Unknown
   Unicast, and Multicast traffic) in an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) network.
   The mechanisms specified in the draft are based on the widely adopted
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.

Internet-Draft                                 Fault Management for EVPN


1. Introduction

   [ietf-bess-evpn-oam-req-frmwk] outlines the OAM requirements of
   Ethernet VPN networks (EVPN [RFC7432]).  This document specifies
   mechanisms for proactive fault detection at the network (overlay)
   layer of EVPN. The mechanisms proposed in the draft use the widely
   adopted Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD [RFC5880]) protocol.

   EVPN fault detection mechanisms need to consider unicast traffic
   separately from Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM)
   traffic since they map to different Forwarding Equivalency Classes
   (FECs) in EVPN. Hence this document proposes different fault
   detection mechanisms to suit each type. For unicast traffic and BUM
   traffic via MP2P tunnels, using BFD [RFC5880], and for BUM traffic
   via a P2MP tunnel, using BFD Multipoint Active Tails [RFC8563]
   [mirsky-mpls-p2mp-bfd].

   Packet loss and packet delay measurement are out of scope for this
   document.

2. Scope of this Document

   This document specifies BFD based mechanisms for proactive fault
   detection for EVPN both as specified in [RFC7432] and also for EVPN
   using VXLAN encapsulation [ietf-vxlan-bfd]. It covers the following:

      o  Unicast traffic.

      o  BUM traffic using Multi-point-to-Point (MP2P) tunnels (ingress
         replication).

      o  BUM traffic using Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) tunnels (Label
         Switched Multicast (LSM)).

      o  MPLS and VXLAN encapsulation.

   This document does not discuss BFD mechanisms for:

      o  EVPN variants like PBB-EVPN [RFC7623].  It is intended to
         address this in future versions.

      o  Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution based on EVPN
         [ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding].  It is intended to
         address this in future versions.

      o  EVPN using other encapsulations such as NVGRE or MPLS over GRE
         [RFC8365].

      o  BUM traffic using MP2MP tunnels.

   This document specifies procedures for BFD asynchronous mode. BFD
   demand mode is outside the scope of this specification except as it
   is used in [RFC8563]. The use of the Echo function is outside the
   scope of this specification.

3. Motivation for Running BFD at the EVPN Network Layer

   The choice of running BFD at the network layer of the OAM model for
   EVPN [ietf-bess-evpn-oam-req-frmwk] was made after considering the
   following:

   o  In addition to detecting link failures in the EVPN network, BFD
      sessions at the network layer can be used to monitor the
      successful setup of MP2P and P2MP EVPN tunnels transporting
      Unicast and BUM traffic such as label programming.  The scope of
      reachability detection covers the ingress and the egress EVPN PE
      nodes and the network connecting them.

   o  Monitoring a representative set of path(s) or a particular path
      among multiple paths available between two EVPN PE nodes could be
      done by exercising entropy mechanisms such as entropy labels, when
      they are used, or VXLAN source ports.  However, paths that cannot
      be realized by entropy variations cannot be monitored.  The fault
      monitoring requirements outlined by [ietf-bess-evpn-oam-req-frmwk]
      are addressed by the mechanisms proposed by this draft.

   BFD testing between EVPN PE nodes does not guarantee that the EVPN
   service is functioning. (This can be monitored at the service level,
   that is CE to CE.) For example, an egress EVPN-PE could understand
   EVPN labeling received but could switch data to an incorrect
   interface.  However, BFD testing in the EVPN Network Layer does
   provide additional confidence that data transported using those
   tunnels will reach the expected egress node.  When BFD testing in the
   EVPN overlay fails, that can be used as an indication of a Loss-of-
   Connectivity defect in the EVPN underlay that would cause EVPN
   service failure.

4. Fault Detection for Unicast Traffic

   The mechanisms specified in BFD for MPLS LSPs [RFC5884] [RFC7726] are
   applied to test the handling of unicast EVPN traffic.  The
   discriminators required for de-multiplexing the BFD sessions are
   advertised through BGP as specified in Section 7. This is needed for
   MPLS since the label stack does not contain enough information to
   disambiguate the sender of the packet.

   The usage of MPLS entropy labels or various VXLAN source ports takes
   care of the requirement to monitor various paths of the multi-path
   server layer network [RFC6790].  Each unique realizable path between
   the participating PE routers MAY be monitored separately when such
   entropy is used.  At least one path of multi-path connectivity
   between two PE routers MUST be tracked with BFD, but in that case the
   granularity of fault-detection will be coarser.  To support unicast
   OAM, each PE node MUST allocate a BFD discriminator to be used for
   BFD messages to that PE and MUST advertise this discriminator with
   BGP as specified in Section 7. Once the BFD session for the EVPN
   label is UP, the ends of the BFD session MUST NOT change the local
   discriminator values of the BFD Control packets they generate, unless
   they first bring down the session as specified in [RFC5884].

5. Fault Detection for BUM Traffic

   Section 5.1 below discusses fault detection for MP2P tunnels using
   ingress replication and Section 5.2 discusses fault detection for
   P2MP tunnels.



5.1 Ingress Replication

   Ingress replication uses separate MP2P tunnels for transporting BUM
   traffic from the ingress PE (head) to a set of one or more egress PEs
   (tails).  The fault detection mechanism specified by this document
   takes advantage of the fact that the head makes a unique copy for
   each tail.

   Another key aspect to be considered in EVPN is the advertisement of
   the inclusive multicast route.  The BUM traffic flows from a head
   node to a particular tail only after the head receives the inclusive
   multicast route. This contains the BUM EVPN label (downstream
   allocated) corresponding to the MP2P tunnel for MPLS encapsulation
   and contains the IP address of the PE originating the inclusive
   multicast route for use in VXLAN encapsulation.

   There MAY exist multiple BFD sessions between a head PE and an
   individual tail due to (1) the usage of MPLS entropy labels [RFC6790]
   or VXLAN source ports for an inclusive multicast FEC and (2) due to
   multiple MP2P tunnels indicated by different tail labels or IP
   addresses for MPLS or VXLAN. The BFD discriminator to be used is
   distributed by BGP as specified in Section 7. Once the BFD session
   for the EVPN label is UP, the BFD systems terminating the BFD session
   MUST NOT change the local discriminator values of the BFD Control
   packets they generate, unless they first bring down the session as
   specified in [RFC5884].



5.2 P2MP Tunnels (Label Switched Multicast)

   Fault detection for BUM traffic distributed using a P2MP tunnel uses
   BFD Multipoint Active Tails in one of the three scenarios providing
   head notification. Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of [RFC8563] describe two
   of these scenarios (Head Notification and Tail Solicitation with
   Multipoint Polling, Head Notification with Composite Polling).
   [mirsky-mpls-p2mp-bfd] describes the third (Head Notification without
   Polling).

   For MPLS encapsulation of the head to tails BFD, Label Switched
   Multicast is used. For VXLAN encapsulation, BFD is delivered to the
   tails through underlay multicast using an outer multicast IP address.

6. BFD Packet Encapsulation

   The sections below describe the MPLS and VXLAN encapsulations of BFD
   for EVPN OAM use.



6.1 MPLS Encapsulation

   This section describes use of the Generic Associated Channel Label
   (GAL) for BFD encapsulation in MPLS based EVPN OAM.



6.1.1 MPLS Unicast

   As shown in Figure 1, the packet initially contains the following
   labels: LSP label (transport), the optional entropy label, the EVPN
   Unicast label, and then the Generic Associated Channel label with the
   G-ACh type set to TBD1.  The G-ACh payload of the packet MUST contain
   the destination L2 header (in overlay space) followed by the IP
   header that encapsulates the BFD packet.  The MAC address of the
   inner packet is used to validate the <EVI, MAC> in the receiving
   node.

      - The destination MAC MUST be the dedicated MAC TBD-A (see Section
        9) or the MAC address of the destination PE.
      - The destination IP address MUST be 127.0.0.1/32 for IPv4
        [RFC1812] or ::1/128 for IPv6 [RFC4291].
      - The destination IP port MUST be 3784 [RFC5881].
      - The source IP port MUST be in the range 49152 through 65535.
      - The discriminator values for BFD are obtained through BGP as
        specified in Section 7 or are exchanged out-of-band or through
        some other means outside the scope of this document.

6.1.2 MPLS Ingress Replication

   The packet initially contains the following labels: LSP label
   (transport), the optional entropy label, the BUM label, and the split
   horizon label [RFC7432] (where applicable).  The G-ACh type is set to
   TBD1.  The G-ACh payload of the packet is as described in Section
   6.1.1.

6.1.3 MPLS LSM (Label Switched Multicast, P2MP)

   The encapsulation is the same as in Section 6.1.2 for ingress
   replication except that the transport label identifies the P2MP
   tunnel, in effect the set of tail PEs, rather than identifying a
   single destination PE at the end of an MP2P tunnel.



6.2 VXLAN Encapsulation

   This section describes the use of the VXLAN [RFC7348] for BFD
   encapsulation in VXLAN based EVPN OAM. This specification conforms to
   [ietf-bfd-vxlan].



6.2.1 VXLAN Unicast

   Figure 2 below shows the unicast VXLAN encapsulation.  The outer and
   inner IP headers have a unicast source IP address of the BFD message
   source and a destination IP address of the BFD message destination

   The destination UDP port MUST be 3784 [RFC5881]. The source port MUST
   be in the range 49152 through 65535. If the BFD source has multiple
   IP addresses, entropy MAY be further obtained by using any of those
   addresses assuming the source is prepared for responses directed to
   the IP address used.

   The Your BFD discriminator is the value distributed for this unicast
   OAM purpose by the destination using BGP as specified in Section 7 or
   is exchanged out-of-band or through some other means outside the
   scope of this document.

6.2.2 VXLAN Ingress Replication

   The BFD packet construction is as given in Section 6.2.1 except as
   follows:
   (1) The destination IP address used by the BFD message source is that
       advertised by the destination PE in its Inclusive Multicast EVPN
       route for the MP2P tunnel in question; and
   (2) The Your BFD discriminator used is the one advertised by the BFD
       destination using BGP as specified in Section 7 for the MP2P
       tunnel in question or is exchanged out-of-band or through some
       other means outside the scope of this document.



6.2.3 VXLAN LSM (Label Switched Multicast, P2MP)

   The VXLAN encapsulation for the head-to-tails BFD packets uses the
   multicast destination IP corresponding to the VXLAN VNI.

   The destination port MUST be 3784. For entropy purposes, the source
   port can vary but MUST be in the range 49152 through 65535 [RFC5881].
   If the head PE has multiple IP addresses, entropy MAY be further
   obtained by using any of those addresses.

   The Your BFD discriminator is the value distributed for this
   multicast OAM purpose by the BFD message using BGP as specified in
   Section 7 or is exchanged out-of-band or through some other means
   outside the scope of this document.

7. BGP Distribution of BFD Discriminators

   BGP is used to distribute BFD discriminators for use in EVPN OAM as
   follows using the BGP-BFD Attribute as specified in
   [ietf-bess-mvpn-fast-failover].  This attribute is included with
   appropriate EVPN routes as follows:

      Unicast:     MAC/IP Advertisement Route [RFC7432].

      MP2P Tunnel: Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route [RFC7432].

      P2MP:        TBD

    [Need more text on BFD sessions reacting to the new advertisement
   and withdrawal of the BGP-BFD Attribute.]

8. Scalability Considerations

   The mechanisms proposed by this draft could affect the packet load on
   the network and its elements especially when supporting
   configurations involving a large number of EVIs.  The option of
   slowing down or speeding up BFD timer values can be used by an
   administrator or a network management entity to maintain the overhead
   incurred due to fault monitoring at an acceptable level.

9. IANA Considerations

   The following IANA Actions are requested.



9.1 Pseudowire Associated Channel Type

   IANA is requested to assign a channel type from the "Pseudowire
   Associated Channel Types" registry in [RFC4385] as follows.

         Value   Description    Reference
         -----   ------------   ------------
         TBD1    BFD-EVPN OAM   [this document]



9.2 MAC Address

   IANA is requested to assign a multicast MAC address under the IANA
   OUI [0x01005E900004 suggested] as follows:

         Address   Usage       Reference
         -------  --------   ---------------
         TBD-A    EVPN OAM   [this document]

10. Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC5880], [RFC5883], and
   [RFC8029] apply.

   MPLS security considerations [RFC5920] apply to BFD Control packets
   encapsulated in a MPLS label stack. When BPD Control packets are
   routed, the authentication considerations discussed in [RFC5883]
   should be followed.

   VXLAN BFD security considerations in [ietf-vxlan-bfd] apply to BFD
   packets encapsulate in VXLAN.
