1.  Introduction

   Globally unique domain names are available to individuals and
   organizations for a modest annual fee.  However, there are situations
   where a globally unique domain name is not available, or has not yet
   been configured, and in these situations it is still desirable to be
   able to use DNS host names [RFC1034] [RFC1035], DNS-Based Service
   Discovery [RFC6763], and other facilites built on top of DNS.

   In the absence of available globally unique domain names, Multicast
   DNS [RFC6762] makes it possible to use DNS-like facilities with names
   that are unique within the local link, using the "local" top-level
   domain.

   This document specifies usage of a similar top-level domain, "home",
   for names that have scope larger than a single link, but smaller than
   the entire global Internet.

   Evidence [ICANN1][ICANN2] indicates that ".home" queries frequently
   leak out and reach the root name servers.  We speculate that this is
   because of widespread usage of ".home" names in home networks, for
   example to name a printer "printer.home."  When a user takes their
   laptop to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, attempts by that laptop to contact
   that printer result in fruitless ".home" queries to the root name
   servers.  It would be beneficial for operators of public Wi-Fi
   hotspots to recognize and answer such queries locally, thereby
   reducing unnecessary load on the root name servers, and this document
   would give those operators the authority to do that.  Readers who are
   aware of other usages of ".home" names, that are not compatible with
   the rules proposed here, are encouraged to contact the authors with
   information to help revise and improve this draft.

   It is expected that the rules for ".home" names outlined here will
   also be suitable to meet the needs of the IETF HOMENET Working Group,
   though that is not the primary goal of this document.  The primary
   goal of this draft is to understand and document the current usage.
   If the needs of the IETF HOMENET Working Group are not met by this
   document codifying the current de facto usage, then the Working Group
   may choose to reserve a different Special Use Domain Name [RFC6761]
   which does meet their needs.  With luck that may not be necessary,
   and a single document may turn out to be sufficient to serve both
   purposes.  In any case, the HOMENET Working Group is likely to be a
   good community in which to find knowledge about how ".home" names are
   currently used.

   [Author's Note, to be removed when document is published: The purpose
   of this draft is not to propose some novel new usage for ".home"
   names.  The purpose is to document and describe the observed current
   widespread behavior, and to solicit feedback about whether that
   description is accurate.]

3.  Mechanism

   Typical residential home gateways configure their local clients via
   DHCP [RFC2131].  In addition to the client's IP address, this DHCP
   configuration information typically also includes other configuration
   parameters, like the IP address of the recursive (caching) DNS server
   the client is to use, which is usually the home gateway's own address
   (the home gateway is also a DNS cache/relay).

   For a home network consisting of just a single link (or several
   physical links bridged together to appear as a single logical link to
   IP) Multicast DNS [RFC6762], which requires no configuration, is
   sufficient for client devices to look up the dot-local host names of
   peers on the same home network, and perform DNS-Based Service
   Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] of services offered on that home
   network.

   For a home network consisting of multiple links that are
   interconnected using IP-layer routing instead of link-layer bridging,
   link-local Multicast DNS alone is insufficient because link-local
   Multicast DNS packets, by design, do not cross between links.  (This
   was a deliberate design choice for Multicast DNS, since even on a
   single link multicast traffic is expensive -- especially on Wi-Fi
   links -- and multiplying the amount of multicast traffic by flooding
   it across multiple links would make that problem even worse.)  In
   this environment, Unicast DNS packets (as may be facilitated by use
   of ".home" names instead of ".local" names) should be used for cross-
   link name resolution and service discovery.

   For residential home networks, Zero Configuration [ZC] operation is
   desirable, without requiring any manual configuration from the user.
   A client device learns about its network environment in a variety of
   ways.  It builds a list of network-recommended DNS search domains
   using DHCP options 15 (Domain Name option [RFC2132]) and 119 (Domain
   Search option [RFC3397]).  It builds a list of network-recommended
   DNS-SD browsing domains by sending domain enumeration queries
   [RFC6763].

   For organizations and individuals with a registered globally unique
   domain name under their control, hosts and services can be given
   names within that domain.  Client devices can be configured to use
   that globally unique domain name as their DNS search domain and/or
   DNS-SD browsing domain [RFC6763].  For example, at IETF meetings the
   network configures client devices to use "meeting.ietf.org." as their
   DNS search domain and DNS-SD browsing domain.  This domain name is
   globally unique and under the control of the IETF.  It is entered
   into the DHCP and DNS servers manually by the IETF meeting network
   administrators, and then communicated automatically via the network

   to client devices.

   When a suitable globally unique domain name is available, as at IETF
   meetings, manual configuration of that name in a residential home
   gateway (or equivalent enterprise equipment) is appropriate.  The
   network infrastructure then communicates that information to clients,
   without any additional manual configuration required on those
   clients.

   However, many residential customers do not have any registered
   globally unique domain name available.  This may be because they
   don't want to pay the annual fee, or because they are unaware of the
   process for obtaining one, or because they are simply uninterested in
   having their own globally unique domain.  This category also includes
   customers who intend to obtain a globally unique domain, but have not
   yet done so.  For these users, it would be valuable to be able to
   perform cross-link name resolution and service discovery using
   Unicast DNS without requiring a globally unique domain name.

   To facilitate zero configuration operation, residential home gateways
   should be sold preconfigured with the default unicast domain name
   "home".  This default unicast domain name is not globally unique,
   since many different residential home gateways will be using the name
   "home" at the same time, but is sufficient for useful operation
   within a small collection of links.  Such residential home gateways
   SHOULD offer a configuration option to allow the default (non-unique)
   unicast domain name to be replaced with a globally unique domain name
   for cases where the customer has a globally unique domain available
   and wishes to use it.

   This use of the the top-level domain "home" for private local use is
   not new.  Many home gateways have been using the name this way for
   many years, and it remains in widespread use, as evidenced by the
   large volume of invalid queries for "home" reaching the root name
   servers [ICANN1][ICANN2].  The current root server traffic load is
   due to things like home gateways configuring clients with "home" as a
   search domain, and then leaking the resulting dot-home queries
   upstream.  In large part what the document proposes is, "stop leaking
   dot-home queries upstream."  This document codifies the existing
   practice, and provides formal grounds basis for ISPs to legitimately
   block such queries in order to reduce unnecessary load on the root
   name servers.

4.  Security Considerations

   Users should be aware that, like private IP addresses [RFC1918],
   names in the "home" domain have only local significance.  The name
   "My-Printer.home" in one location may not reference the same device
   as "My-Printer.home" in a different location.


5.  IANA Considerations

   [Once published, this should say] IANA has recorded the top-level
   domain "home" in the Special-Use Domain Names registry [SUDN].

5.1.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

   The top-level domain "home", and any names falling within that domain
   (e.g., "My-Computer.home.", "My-Printer.home.", "_ipp._tcp.home."),
   are special [RFC6761] in the following ways:

   1.  Users may use these names as they would other DNS names, entering
       them anywhere that they would otherwise enter a conventional DNS
       name, or a dotted decimal IPv4 address, or a literal IPv6
       address.

       Since there is no global authority responsible for assigning dot-
       home names, devices on different parts of the Internet could be
       using the same name.  Users SHOULD be aware that using a name
       like "www.home" may not actually connect them to the web site
       they expected, and could easily connect them to a different web
       page, or even a fake or spoof of their intended web site,
       designed to trick them into revealing confidential information.
       As always with networking, end-to-end cryptographic security can
       be a useful tool.  For example, when connecting with ssh, the ssh
       host key verification process will inform the user if it detects
       that the identity of the entity they are communicating with has
       changed since the last time they connected to that name.

   2.  Application software may use these names the same way it uses
       traditional globally unique Unicast DNS names, and does not need
       to recognize these names and treat them specially in order to
       work correctly.  This document specifies the use of the top-level
       domain "home" in on-the-wire messages.  Ideally this would be
       purely a protocol-level identifier, not seen by end users.
       However, in some applications domain names are seen by end users,
       and in those cases, the protocol-level identifier "home" becomes
       visible, even for users for whom English is not their preferred
       language.  For this reason, applications MAY choose to use
       additional UI cues (icon, text color, font, highlighting, etc.)

       to communicate to the user that this is a special name with
       special properties.  Due to the relative ease of spoofing dot-
       home names, end-to-end cryptographic security remains important
       when communicating across a local network, just as it is when
       communicating across the global Internet.

   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD NOT recognize these
       names as special and SHOULD NOT treat them differently.  Name
       resolution APIs SHOULD send queries for these names to their
       configured recursive/caching DNS server(s).

   4.  Recursive/caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize these names as
       special and SHOULD NOT, by default, attempt to look up NS records
       for them, or otherwise query authoritative DNS servers in an
       attempt to resolve these names.  Instead, recursive/caching DNS
       servers SHOULD, by default, act as authoritative and generate
       immediate responses for all such queries.  This is to avoid
       unnecessary load on the root name servers and other name servers.

       The type of response generated depends on the role of the
       recursive/caching DNS server: (i) Traditional recursive DNS
       servers (such as those run by ISPs providing service to their
       customers) SHOULD, by default, generate immediate negative
       responses for all such queries. (ii) Recursive/caching DNS
       servers incorporated into residential home gateways of the kind
       described by this document should act as authoritative for these
       names and return positive or negative responses as appropriate.

       Recursive/caching DNS servers MAY offer a configuration option to
       enable upstream resolving of these names, for use in networks
       where these names are known to be handled by an authoritative DNS
       server in said private network.  This option SHOULD be disabled
       by default, and SHOULD be enabled only when appropriate, to avoid
       queries leaking out of the private network and placing
       unnecessary load on the root name servers.

   5.  Traditional authoritative DNS servers SHOULD recognize these
       names as special and SHOULD, by default, generate immediate
       negative responses for all such queries, unless explicitly
       configured otherwise by the administrator.  As described above,
       DNS servers incorporated into residential home gateways of the
       kind described by this document should act as authoritative for
       these names and return positive or negative responses as
       appropriate, unless explicitly configured otherwise by the
       administrator.

   6.  DNS server operators SHOULD, if they are using these names,
       configure their authoritative DNS servers to act as authoritative

       for these names.  In the case of zero-configuration residential
       home gateways of the kind described by this document, this
       configuration is implicit in the design of the product, rather
       than a result of conscious administration by the customer.

   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register
       these names in the normal way to any person or entity.  These
       names are reserved for use in private networks and fall outside
       the set of names available for allocation by registries/
       registrars.  Attempting to allocate a these name as if it were a
       normal DNS domain name will probably not work as desired, for
       reasons 4, 5, and 6 above.
