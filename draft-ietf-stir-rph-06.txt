1.  Introduction

   PASSporT [RFC8225] is a token format based on JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [RFC7519] for conveying cryptographically signed information about
   the identities involved in personal communications.  PASSporT with
   STIR [RFC8224] provides a mechanism by which an authority on the
   originating side of a call via a protocol like SIP [RFC3261] can
   provide a cryptographic assurance of the validity of the calling
   party telephone number in order to prevent impersonation attacks.

   [RFC4412] defines the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field for
   communications 'Resource-Priority'.  As specified in [RFC4412], the
   'SIP Resource-Priority' header field may be used by SIP user agents
   [RFC3261] (including Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
   gateways and SIP proxy servers) to influence prioritization afforded
   to communication sessions including PSTN calls (e.g., to manage
   scarce network resources during network congestion scenarios).
   However, the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field could be spoofed
   and abused by unauthorized entities, the threat models and use cases
   of which are described in [RFC7375] and [RFC7340], respectively.

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                      May 2018


   Compromise of the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field [RFC4412]
   could lead to misuse of network resource (i.e., during congestion
   scenarios) resulting in impacts to the application services supported
   using the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field.

   [RFC8225]  allows extensions by which an authority on the originating
   side verifying the authorization of a particular communication for
   'SIP Resource-Priority' can use a PASSPorT claim to cryptographically
   sign the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field and convey assertion of
   the authorization for 'Resource-Priority'.  Signed 'SIP Resource-
   Priority' header field will allow a receiving entity (including
   entities located in different network domains/boundaries) to verify
   the validity of assertions authorizing 'Resource-Priority' and to act
   on the information with confidence that the information has not been
   spoofed or compromised.

   This specification documents an extension to PASSporT and the
   associated STIR mechanisms to provide a function to cryptographically
   sign the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field.  This PASSporT object
   is used to provide attestation of a calling user authorization for
   priority communications.  This is necessary in addition to the
   PASSporT object that is used for calling user telephone number
   attestation.  How this extension to PASSporT is used for real-time
   communications supported using 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field
   is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, the PASSPorT
   extension defined in this document is intended for use in
   environments where there are means to verify that the signer of the
   'SIP Resource-Priority' header field is authoritative.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   in RFC 8174 [RFC8174].

3.  PASSporT 'rph' Claim

   This specification defines a new JSON Web Token claim for "rph",
   which provides an assertion for information in 'SIP Resource-
   Priority' header field.

   The creator of a PASSporT object adds a "ppt" value of "rph" to the
   header of a PASSporT object, in which case the PASSporT claims MUST
   contain a "rph" claim, and any entities verifying the PASSporT object
   will be required to understand the "ppt" extension in order to
   process the PASSporT in question.  A PASSPorT header with the "ppt"
   included will look as follows:



Singh, et al.           Expires November 25, 2018               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                      May 2018


   {
   "typ":"passport",
     "ppt":"rph",
     "alg":"ES256",
     "x5u":"https://www.example.org/cert.cer"
   }

   The "rph" claim will provide an assertion of authorization, "auth",
   for information in the 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field based on
   [RFC4412] and the syntax is:

   {
   Resource-Priority = "Resource-Priority" : r-value,
   r-value= namespace  "."  r-priority
   }

   Specifically, the "rph" claim includes an assertion of the priority-
   level of the user to be used for a given communication session.  The
   value of the "rph" claim is an Object with one or more keys.  Each
   key is associated with a JSON Array.  These arrays contain Strings
   that correspond to the r-values indicated in the 'SIP Resource-
   Priority' header field.

   The following is an example "rph" claim for a 'SIP Resource-Priority'
   header field with one r-value of "ets.0" and with another r-value of
   "wps.0":

    {
     "orig":{"tn":"12155550112"},
     "dest":{["tn":"12125550113"]},
     "iat":1443208345,
     "rph":{"auth":["ets.0", "wps.0"]}
    }

   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,
   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in [RFC8225]
   using the full form of PASSPorT.  The credentials (i.e., Certificate)
   used to create the signature must have authority over the namespace
   of the "rph" claim and there is only one authority per claim.  The
   authority MUST use its credentials associated with the specific
   service supported by the resource priority namespace in the claim.
   If r-values are added or dropped by the intermediaries along the
   path, intermediaries must generate a new "rph" header and sign the
   claim with its own authority.

   The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this
   document.

4.  'rph' in SIP

   This section specifies SIP-specific usage for the "rph" claim in
   PASSporT.

4.1.  Authentication Service Behavior

   The Authentication Service will create the "rph" claim using the
   values discussed in section 3 of this document that are based on
   [RFC4412].  The construction of "rph" claim follows the steps
   described in Section 4.1 of [RFC8224].

   The resulting Identity header for "rph" might look as
   follows(backslashes shown for line folding only):

      Identity:eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInBwdCI6InJwaCIsInR5cCI6InBhc3Nwb3J0\
      IiwieDV1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vY2VydC5jZXIifQo.eyJkZ\
      XN0Ijp7WyJ0biI6IjEyMTI1NTUwMTEzIl19LCJpYXQiOiIxNDQzMjA4MzQ1Iiwib3\
      JpZyI6eyJ0biI6IjEyMTU1NTUwMTEyIn0sInJwaCI6eyJhdXRoIjpbImV0cy4wIiw\
      id3BzLjAiXX19Cg.s37S6VC8HM6Dl6YzJeQDsrZcwJ0lizxhUrA7f_98oWBHvo-cl\
      -n8MIhoCr18vYYFy3blXvs3fslM_oos2P2Dyw;info=<https://www.example.\
      org/cert.cer>;alg=ES256;ppt="rph"

   A SIP authentication service will derive the value of "rph" from the
   'SIP Resource-Priority' header field based on policy associated with
   service specific use of the "namespace "." r-priority" for r-values
   based on [RFC4412].  The authentication service derives the value of
   the PASSPorT claim by verifying the authorization for 'SIP Resource-
   Priority' (i.e., verifying a calling user privilege for 'Resource-
   Priority' based on its identity) which might be derived from customer
   profile data or from access to external services.

   [RFC4412] allows multiple "namespace "." priority value" pairs,
   either in a single 'SIP Resource-Priority' header field or across
   multiple 'SIP Resource-Priority' headers.  An authority is
   responsible for signing all the content of a 'SIP Resource-Priority'
   header field for which it has the authority.

4.2.  Verification Service Behavior

   [RFC8224] Section 6.2 Step 5 requires that specifications defining
   "ppt" values describe any additional verifier behavior.  The behavior
   specified for the "ppt" values of "rph" is as follows:

   The verification service MUST extract the value associated with the
   "auth" key in a full form PASSPorT with a "ppt" value of "rph".  If
   the signature validates, then the verification service can use the
   value of the "rph" claim as validation that the calling party is

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                      May 2018


   authorized for 'SIP Resource-Priority' as indicated in the claim.
   This value would in turn be used for priority treatment in accordance
   with local policy for the associated communication service.  If the
   signature validation fails, the verification service should infer
   that the calling party is not authorized for 'SIP Resource-Priority'
   as indicated in the claim.  In such cases, the priority treatment for
   the associated communication service is handled as per the local
   policy of the verifier.  In such scenarios, 'SIP Resource-Priority'
   header field SHOULD be stripped from SIP request and the network
   entities should treat the call as an ordinary call.

   In addition, [RFC8224] Section 6.2 Step 4 requires the "iat" value in
   "rph" claim to be verified.

   The behavior of a SIP UA upon receiving an INVITE containing a
   PASSporT object with a "rph" claim will largely remain a matter of
   implementation policy for the specific communication service.  In
   most cases, implementations would act based on confidence in the
   veracity of this information.

5.  Further Information Associated with 'Resource-Priority'

   There may be additional information about the calling party or the
   call that could be relevant to authorization for 'SIP Resource-
   Priority'.  This may include information related to the device
   subscription of the caller, or to any institutions that the caller or
   device is associated with, or even categories of institutions.  All
   of these data elements would benefit from the secure attestations
   provided by the STIR and PASSporT frameworks.  The specification of
   the "rph" claim could entail the optional presence of one or more
   such additional information fields applicable to 'SIP Resource-
   Priority'.

   A new IANA registry has been defined to hold potential values of the
   "rph" array; see Section 6.2.  The definition of the "rph" claim may
   have one or more such additional information field(s).  Details of
   such "rph" claim to encompass other data elements are left for future
   version of this specification.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  JSON Web Token Claims

   This specification requests that the IANA add a new claim to the JSON
   Web Token Claims registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   o  Claim Name: "rph"




Singh, et al.           Expires November 25, 2018               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                      May 2018


   o  Claim Description: Resource Priority Header Authorization

   o  Change Controller: IESG

   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of [RFCThis]

6.2.  PASSporT Types

   This specification also requests that the IANA creates a new entry to
   the PASSporT Types registry for the type "rph" which is specified in
   [RFCThis].  In addition, another registry needs to be created in
   which each entry must contain two fields: the name of the "rph" type
   and the specification in which the type is described.  This registry
   is to be initially populated with a single value for "auth" which is
   specified in [RFCThis].  Registration of new "rph" types shall be
   under the specification required policy.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC8224] in Section 12 are
   applicable here.

7.1.  Avoidance of replay and cut and paste attacks

   The PASSporT extension with a "ppt" value of "rph" MUST only be sent
   with SIP INVITE when 'Resource-Priority' header field is used to
   convey the priority of the communication as defined in [RFC4412].  To
   avoid replay, and cut and paste attacks, the recommendations provided
   in Section 12.1 of [RFC8224] MUST be followed.

7.2.  Solution Considerations

   Using extensions to PASSporT tokens with a "ppt" value of "rph"
   requires knowledge of the authentication, authorization, and
   reputation of the signer to attest to the identity being asserted,
   including validating the digital signature and the associated
   certificate chain to a trust anchor.  The following considerations
   should be recognized when using PASSporT extensions with a "ppt"
   value of "rph":

   o  A signer is only allowed to sign the content of a 'SIP Resource-
      Priority' header field for which it has the proper authorization.
      Before signing tokens, the signer MUST have a secure method for
      authentication of the end user or the device being granted a
      token.

   o  The verification of the signature MUST include means of verifying
      that the signer is authoritative for the signed content of the
      resource priority namespace in the PASSporT.
