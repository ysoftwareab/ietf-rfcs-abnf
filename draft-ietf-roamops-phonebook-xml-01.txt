2.  Abstract

   This document describes the information to be included in the
   standard phone book for roaming applications.  All data is described
   in XML [5] (Extensible Markup Language) syntax leading to a concise
   XML DTD (Document Type Declaration) for the phone book.  Goals of
   this document include:

      - Creating a flexible, extensible and robust framework
        upon which to build a standard phone book

Internet-Draft             Phone Book XML DTD                  June 1999


      - Promoting a standard phone book format, to enhance
        interoperability between ISPs and roaming consortia
      - Defining a compact structure containing the essential
        information for the roaming user, to allow for storage
        and easy update even on small devices.

   It is not intended by this document to create a "Swiss army knife",
   with phone book elements to please everyone on Earth, neither to
   define any kind of phone book update or transfer protocol.


3.  Rationale for XML Usage

   XML is rapidly becoming a standard format for data exchange between
   different applications also taking into account the transfer and
   access of data over the web. XML is used as syntax for expressing the
   structure and content of a roaming phone book to enable widespread
   usage and access to many different kind of media (e.g. paper, CDROM,
   www) using a widespread selection of access devices. Furthermore XML
   enables:

      - Extensibility
      - Flexibility
      - Integration with directories

   Extensibility is important because phone books are living documents;
   as such, it is unlikely that all the semantic requirements of
   arbitrary Internet service providers (ISPs) would be met by a fixed
   scheme, no matter how well thought out.  Phone book designers must be
   free to create new attributes in a well-understood fashion to meet
   changing business needs.

   Flexibility is required of the attribute definition syntax for many
   of the same reasons that semantic extensibility is necessary. If we
   assume that phone book designers may need to define elements of
   arbitrary type, the syntax chosen must be able to represent these
   data objects cleanly.  Using XML for describing the data content of
   the phone book fits this bill nicely, since it can be used to
   unambiguously describe virtually any data type.

   Integration with directories: although it is unlikely that phone
   books will be stored in the directory due to performance
   considerations, the creation of a XML DTD describing phone book
   content leaves that option open, with relatively little incremental
   effort required to implement it.

4.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [1].


5.  Value type notations for 'stronger' typing

   XML currently does not have capabilities for 'strong typing' of the
   content of elements. The only type definition foreseen in the base
   specification is "#PCDATA", 'parsable character data'. This might be
   sufficient and is used throughout this document to define elements
   containing information mainly aimed for interpretation by human
   beings.
   To enable a more concise description of the content of particular
   elements several value type notations are introduced. This allows for
   a more detailed type description of the content of elements in cases
   where it seems to be desirable.

6.  Phone Book Element Definitions

   The phoneBook element is the basic container for phone book entries.
   It always contains a phone book name, a phone book version number
   (applying to the phone book as a whole) and one or more pop elements.
   A phoneBook element may also contain multiple Setup, Support and
   Provider elements, if they are referenced to by more than one pop
   element.

6.1.  Phone Book Name

   The phoneBookName element is an arbitrary string assigned as an
   identifier for a phone book.

   Syntax:
      <!-- The name of the phone book -->
      <!ELEMENT phoneBookName (#PCDATA)>

6.2.  Phone Book Version

   The phoneBookVersion attribute is an integer representing the version
   of the phone book; it is a monotonically increasing counter which
   should be incremented each time the phone book is modified.
   This element can be used by a server to help decide what (if any)
   actions are required to bring a client's phone book up to date. For
   example, the client can, at connect time, send an update request to
   the server including in the request the version number of its current
   phone book. If the client's phone book version is not the same as the
   server's current phone book version, the server can easily take
   appropriate action, e.g., reply with a URL pointing to a file
   containing the differences between the client and server phone books.

   Syntax:
      <!-- Version number of the phone book -->
      <!ELEMENT phoneBookVersion (#PCDATA)>


6.3.  POP

   The pop element contains information elements relevant to individual
   network points of presence (POPs). The required information elements
   are addrFamily, address, media and entryVersion. The media element
   represents the media types supported by the POP, while the
   entryVersion element is a monotonically-increasing integer which
   should be incremented whenever the object is modified.

   Syntax:
      <!ELEMENT pop (
           entryVersion,

           popProvider? )>


6.4.  Setup

   The Setup element includes information elements which describe
   services which may change from provider to provider or even from POP
   to POP.  Some of the values contained in these information elements
   may be available by other means (e.g., DHCP), but others may not.

   Syntax:
      <!ELEMENT setup (

      <!ATTLIST setup
            id      ID      #REQUIRED>


6.5.  Support

   The Support element includes those information elements that are
   pertinent to the provision of customer support for a POP or provider.

   Syntax:
      <!ELEMENT support (
            supportTelephoneNumber?,
            supportLanguages?,
            supportMailtoURL? )>

6.6.  Provider

   The Provider element contains information elements pertaining to the
   general business operations of a given network service provider.  The
   information elements include such things as telephone number, mailing
   address, etc., as well as URLs for e-mail and a World Wide Web site.
   A Provider element may also contain a reference to support
   information.

   Syntax:

   attribute will generally contain an IA5 string representing a
   telephone number, formatted in standard fashion [4] (e.g. "+ 1 234
   5678").

   Syntax:

7.1.5.  Encoding Type

   The encodingType element is an integer representing the type of
   encoding used within a specific address family The value '0' is
   reserved and represents the native encoding.

   reached at address.
   The initially defined modem protocol flags are listed in the table
   below. All 'Position' values are in hexadecimal, all 'Speed' values
   are in bits per second. If the bit in 'Position' is 1, 'Protocol' is
   supported; otherwise, 'Protocol' is unsupported. For example, the
   string 00110001 (0x31) means that V.21, V.32bis and V.34 are
   supported while V.22, V.29 and V.32 are not.

   the ISDN protocols supported by the access devices that can be
   reached at address.
   The initially defined ISDN protocols are listed in the table below.
   All 'Value. values are in hexadecimal, all 'Speed' values are in bits
   per second. If the bit in 'Position' is 1, 'Protocol' is supported;
   otherwise, 'Protocol' is unsupported. For example, the string 0x0d
   (00001101) means that V.120 is supported at both 56K and 64K bps
   while V.110 is supported only at 19.2K bps.

9.  Security Considerations

   In the current revision there are no security specific elements
   provided within the phone book XML DTD. Security has to be provided
   outside of the scope of the phone book.

   Security specific items, like a signature for authentication the
   content of the phone book, may be added in a later revision, if
   standards are available for generating digital signatures in XML.
