        IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Extensions for Prefix Delegation
                 draft-templin-6man-dhcpv6-ndopt-03.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) specifies a control message set for
   nodes to discover neighbors, routers, prefixes and other services on
   the link.  It also supports a manner of StateLess Address
   AutoConfiguration (SLAAC).  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specifies a service for the stateful delegation of
   addresses and prefixes.  This document presents IPv6ND extensions for
   providing a unified prefix delegation service.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) [RFC4861] specifies a control
   message set for nodes to discover neighbors, routers, prefixes and
   other services on the link.  It also supports a manner of StateLess
   Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC).  The Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specifies a service for the stateful
   delegation of addresses and prefixes [RFC3315][RFC3633].  This
   document presents possible methods for providing a unified prefix
   delegation service.

   When a node first comes onto the link, it sends a Router Solicitation
   (RS) message to elicit a Router Advertisement (RA) message from one
   or more routers for the link.  If the node also needs to acquire
   prefix delegations (and, if the 'M' bit is set in the RA message) it
   then sends a DHCPv6 Solicit message to elicit a Reply message from a
   DHCPv6 server that is authoritative for the link.  This two round-
   trip message exchange can add delay as well as waste critical link
   bandwidth on low-end links (e.g., aeronautical wireless links).

   While it is possible to conceive of starting both round trip
   exchanges at the same time (i.e., under the leap-of-faith assumption
   that the link supports DHCPv6 before examining the 'M' bit) this
   would result in twice as many channel access transactions as
   necessary.

   This document proposes methods for combining these separate
   operations into a single, unified exchange based on IPv6ND messaging
   for the purpose of prefix delegation.  It notes that a prefix
   delegation exchange must include at a minimum:

   o  an explicit request for a prefix

   o  the identity of the requesting node

   o  a transaction ID that the requesting node can use to match replies
      with their corresponding requests

   o  any security parameters necessary for the requesting node to
      establish its authorization to receive a prefix

   The first method is through definition of a new IPv6ND option called
   the "DHCPv6 Option" that combines the IPv6ND router discovery and
   DHCPv6 managed prefix acquisition processes into a single message
   exchange.  Nodes include the DHCPv6 option in RS messages to solicit
   an RA message with a DHCPv6 option in return.  This allows the IPv6ND
   and DHCPv6 functions to work together to supply the client with all
   needed configuration information in a minimum number of messages.

   The second method leverages the PIO-X proposal
   [I-D.pioxfolks-6man-pio-exclusive-bit] where the router sets the "X
   (eXclusive)" bit in an RA Prefix Information Option (PIO) to inform
   the node that the prefix is provided for the node's own exclusive
   use.  This document permits nodes to include PIO-Xs in their RS
   messages for the purpose of requesting prefix delegations from
   routers.

   The third method uses out-of-band messaging for the node to request a
   prefix delegation outside of the scope of IPv6ND messaging.  The out-
   of-band messaging could entail some sort of network login process
   (e.g., through Layer-2 (L2) messaging, etc).  The end result of the
   out-of-band messaging is that the router returns an RA message with
   either a PIO-X or DHCPv6 Option to the requesting node (the node
   having first explicitly requested the prefix delegation in the out-
   of-band exchange).

   The following sections present considerations for nodes that employ
   these approaches.

2.  DHCPv6 Options in IPv6 ND Messages

   The first method discussed in this document is the inclusion of
   DHCPv6 message options in IPv6ND RS and RA messages, as discussed in
   the following sections.

2.1.  The DHCPv6 Option

   The DHCPv6 option is a new IPv6ND option that simply embeds a
   standard DHCPv6 message per section 6 of [RFC3315], beginning with
   the 'msg-type' followed by the 'transaction-id' and all DHCPv6
   'options'.  The format of the option is as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Type = TBD   |    Length     | Pad |        Reserved         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    msg-type   |               transaction-id                  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                                                               |
       .                            options                            .
       .                           (variable)                          .
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                  Figure 1: IPv6 ND DHCPv6 Option Format

   In this format, 'Type' and 'Length' are exactly as defined in
   Section 4.6 of [RFC4861], 'Pad' encodes the number of trailing zero
   octets (between 0 - 7) that appear at the end of the option to pad to
   an integral number of 8-octets, 'Reserved' is included for alignment
   and potential future use, and the rest of the option is exactly as
   defined in Section 6 of [RFC3315].  The length of the full DHCPv6
   message is determined by ((('Length' * 8) - 4) - 'Pad'), for a
   maximum message length of 2044 octets.

   The 'Reserved' field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored on
   reception.  Future specifications MAY define new uses for these bits.

2.2.  DHCPv6 Option Usage

   When a node first comes onto the link, it creates a Router
   Solicitation (RS) message containing a DHCPv6 option that embeds a
   DHCPv6 Solicit message.  The Solicit may include a Rapid Commit
   option if a two-message exchange (i.e., instead of four) is required.
   The node then sends the RS message either to the unicast address of a
   specific router on the link, or to the All-Routers multicast address.

   When a router receives an RS message with a DHCPv6 option, if it does
   not recognize the option and/or does not employ a DHCPv6 relay agent
   or server, it returns a Router Advertisement (RA) message as normal
   and without including a DHCPv6 option.  By receiving the RA message
   with no DHCPv6 option, the node can determine that the router does
   not recognize the option and/or does not support a DHCPv6 relay/
   server function.  In this way, no harm will have come from the node
   including the DHCPv6 option in the RS, and the function is fully
   backwards compatible.

   When a router receives an RS message with a DHCPv6 option, if it
   recognizes the option and employs a DHCPv6 relay agent or server, it
   extracts the DHCPv6 message from the RS message and forwards the
   message to the DHCPv6 relay agent or server.  When the DHCPv6 message
   reaches a DHCPv6 server, the server processes the DHCPv6 Solicit
   message and prepares either an Advertise (four message) or Reply (two
   message) DHCPv6 message containing any delegated addresses, prefixes
   and/or any other information the server is configured to send.  The
   server then returns the Advertise/Reply message to the router.

   When the router receives the DHCPv6 Advertise/Reply message, it
   creates a Router Advertisement (RA) message that includes any
   autoconfiguration information necessary for the link and also embeds
   the DHCPv6 message in a DHCPv6 option within the body of the RA.  The
   router then returns the RA as a unicast message response to the node
   that sent the RS.

   In a two message exchange, the prefix delegation is completed when
   the node receives the RA.  In a four message exchange, the reqeusting
   node can Decline any prefix delegations it does not wish to accept
   and/or send unicast Request messages in subsequent RSes to get a
   delegated prefix Reply message back from the router or routers of its
   choosing.

   At any time after the initial RS/RA exchange, the node may need to
   issue a DHCPv6 Renew, Release or Rebind message, e.g., to extend
   address/prefix lifetimes.  In that case, the node prepares a DHCPv6
   message option and inserts it in an RS message which it then sends
   via unicast to the router.  The router in turn processes the message
   the same as for DHCPv6 Solicit/Reply.

   At any time after the initial RS/RA exchange, the DHCPv6 server may
   need to issue a DHCPv6 Reconfigure message.  In that case, when the
   router receives the DHCPv6 Reconfigure message it prepares a unicast
   RA message with a DHCPv6 option that encodes the Reconfigure and
   sends the RA as an unsolicited unicast message to the node.

2.3.  Prefix Delegation Requirements

   Using the DHCPv6 Option, the message itself includes an Identity
   Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) option to request a prefix
   delegation.  The DHCPv6 Device Unique IDentifier (DUID) provides the
   the identity of the requesting node, and the DHCPv6 transacation-id
   provides a unique identifier for matching RS and RA messages.
   Finally, the message can be protected using SEcure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) [RFC3971].

2.4.  Implementation Considerations

   The IPv6ND function and DHCPv6 function are typically implemented in
   separate router modules.  In that case, the IPv6ND function extracts
   the DHCPv6 message from the option included in the RS message and
   wraps it in IP/UDP headers.  The source address in the IP header is
   set to the node's link-local address, and the source port in the UDP
   header is set to the port number associated with the IPv6ND function.
   The IPv6ND function then acts as a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   (LDRA) [RFC6221] to forward the message to the DHCPv6 relay or server
   function on-board the router.

   The forwarded DHCPv6 message then traverses any additional relays on
   the reverse path until it reaches the DHCPv6 server.  When the DHCPv6
   server processes the message, it delegates any necessary resources
   and sends a Reply via the same relay agent path as had occurred on
   the reverse path so that the Reply will eventually arrive back at the
   IPv6ND function.  The IPv6ND function then prepares an RA message
   with any autoconfiguration information associated with the link,
   embeds the DHCPv6 message body in an IPv6ND DHCPv6 option, and
   returns the message via unicast to the node that sent the RS.

   In a preferred implementation, however, the IPv6ND and DHCPv6
   functions could be co-located in the same module on the router.  In
   that way the two functions would be coupled as though they were in
   fact a single unified function without the need for any LDRA
   processing.

3.  PIO Options in RS Messages

   The second method discussed in this document is the inclusion of
   PIO-X options in IPv6ND RS messages, as discussed in the following
   sections.

3.1.  The PIO-X Option

   The PIO option for solicited prefix delegation is formatted exactly
   as specified in [RFC4861] except including the "X" bit as defined in
   [I-D.pioxfolks-6man-pio-exclusive-bit].  We refer to PIO options with
   the "X" bit set as "PIO-X" options.  The format of the option is as
   follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       |                                                               |
       +                                                               +

       +                                                               +
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 2: PIO-X Option Format

   In this format, all feilds are exactly as defined in Section 4.6 of
   [RFC4861].  The "X" bit is set to 1 if the prefix is to be provided
   for the node's own exclusive use.  If "X" is set to 0, no statement
   is made about the prefix's exclusivity.

3.2.  PIO-X Option Usage

   When a node that wishes to request an eXclusive prefix first comes
   onto the link, it creates a Router Solicitation (RS) message
   containing a PIO-X.  It sets the Prefix Length to either the length
   of the prefix it wishes to receive or '0' (unspecified) if it will
   defer to the router's preference.  The node then sets the Valid and
   Preferred Lifetimes to either its preferred values or '0'
   (unspecified) if it will defer to the router's preference.  The node
   then sets the Prefix to either the prefix it wishes to receive, or
   '0' (unspecified) if it will defer to the router's preference.  The
   node then sends the RS message either to the unicast address of a
   specific router on the link, or to the All-Routers multicast address.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 ND Extensions for PD           January 2018


   When a router receives an RS message with a PIO-X option, if it is
   not configured to accept PIO-Xs in RS messages it returns a Router
   Advertisement (RA) message as normal and without including a PIO-X.
   By receiving the RA message with no PIO-X, the node can determine
   that the router does not recognize the option and/or does not support
   a PIO-X prefix delegation service.  In this way, no harm will have
   come from the node including the PIO-X in the RS, and the function is
   fully backwards compatible.

   When a router receives an RS message with a PIO-X, if it recognizes
   the option and can provide prefix delegation services it examines the
   fields in the message and selects a prefix to delegate to the node.
   If the PIO-X included a non-zero Prefix, the router delegates the
   node's preferred prefix if possible.  Otherwise, the router selects a
   prefix to delegate to the node with length based on the node's Prefix
   Length.  The router sets lifetimes matching the lifetimes requested
   by the node if possible, or shorter lifetimes if the node's requested
   lifetimes are too long.  The router finally prepares a PIO-X
   containing this information and inserts it into an RA message to send
   back to the source of the RS.

3.3.  Prefix Delegation Requirements

   Using the PIO-X, the option itself requests a prefix delegation.  The
   RS message link-layer addresss can be used as the identity of the
   requesting node.  The RS message SHOULD include a Nonce option
   [RFC3971] to provide a unique identifier for matching RS and RA
   messages.  Finally, the message can be protected using SEND the same
   as for the DHCPv6 option [RFC3971].

3.4.  Implementation Considerations

   Each router can implement a prefix delegation database management
   service of their own choosing, but an attractive alternative would be
   to use the already-existing DHCPv6 service as the back-end prefix
   management service.  In this way, all communications between the
   router's link to the requesting node are via PIO-X RS/RA messaging.
   But, when the router receives an RS message with a PIO-X it can
   create a syntehsized DHCPv6 Solicit message to send to the DHCPv6
   server.  This can be done exactly the same as for the approach
   discussed in Section 2.4.  In this way, the node on the link over
   which the PIO-X is advertised only ever sees RS/RA messages on the
   front end, and the router gets to use the mature and widely deployed
   DHCPv6 service for prefix management on the back end.

4.  Out-of-Band Network Login Messaging

   The third method entails and out-of-band messaging exchange sometimes
   known as a "network login" procedure.  During the network login, the
   requesting node could have a multi-message exchange with the network
   to set the stage for the router eventually sending an RA message as
   discusssed in the following sections

4.1.  Out-of-Band Network Login

   In the out-of-band network login, the node signs into the network
   using, e.g., a login/password, a security certificate, etc.  The node
   authenticates itself to the network, and can optionally have an
   iterative exchange to request certain aspects of the node's desired
   prefix delegation.  The network then signals the node's first-hop
   router to prepare an RA message with a PIO-X option.

4.2.  Out-of-Band Network Login Usage

   When a node that wishes to request a prefix delegation first comes
   onto the link, it engages in a network login session using some form
   of out-of-band messaging such as Layer 2 (L2) messaging.  The session
   entails a security exchange where the node authenticates itself to
   the network and proves its authorization to receive its desired
   prefix.  The network then signals the router to send an RA message
   with a PIO-X to the node, either unsolicited or in response to the
   node's RS message.

4.3.  Prefix Delegation Requirements

   Using out-of-band messaging, the node engages in a (possibly) multi-
   message exchange where a request for a prefix delegation is conveyed.
   The node's link-layer addresss can be used as the identity of the
   requesting node.  The out-of-band exchange provides a unique per-
   message identifier so that the node can correlate its message
   requests with the responses it gets back from the network.  Finally,
   the message exchange itself contains security parameters for
   authenticating the requesting node.

4.4.  Implementation Considerations

   The network login system and routers must be tightly coupled so that
   the network login can securely convey the reqesting node's identity
   to the router.

   As for the PIO-X-based prefix delegation discussed in Section 3.4,
   DHCPv6 can be used as the back-end service for managing the prefix
   delegation database.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to assign an IPv6ND option Type value TBD for
   the DHCPv6 option.

   The IANA is instructed to create a registry for the DHCPv6 option
   "Reserved" field so that future uses of bits in the field can be
   coordinated.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] and
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315][RFC3633] apply to this document.

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] can provide authentication
   for the combined DHCPv6/IPv6ND messages with no need for additional
   securing mechanisms.
