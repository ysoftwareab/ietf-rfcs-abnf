   Experimental Codepoint Allocation for the Path Computation Element
                     communication Protocol (PCEP)
                 draft-ietf-pce-pcep-exp-codepoints-02

Abstract

   IANA assigns values to the Path Computation Element (PCE)
   communication Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages, objects, TLVs).
   IANA established a new top-level registry to contain all PCEP
   codepoints and sub-registries.  The allocation policy for each new
   registry is by IETF Review.

   This document updates RFC 5440 by changing the allocation policies
   for these three registries to mark some of the code points as
   assigned for Experimental Use.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

Internet-Draft                EXP-CODEPOINT                  August 2017


   Further, in order to support use cases described in [RFC8051],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSPs via PCEP.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup, maintenance and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

   In section 9 of [RFC5440], IANA assigns values to the PCEP protocol
   parameters (messages, objects, TLVs).  IANA established a new top-
   level registry to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries.
   The allocation policy for each new registry is by IETF Review as
   described in [RFC8126].  Also, early allocation [RFC7120] provides
   some latitude for allocation of these code points, but is reserved
   for features that are considered appropriately stable.

   With some recent advancement, there is an enhanced need to experiment
   with PCEP.  It is often necessary to use some sort of number or
   constant in order to actually test or experiment with the new
   function, even when testing in a closed environment.  In order to run
   experiments, it is important that the value won't collide not only
   with existing codepoints but any future allocation.

   This document updates [RFC5440] by changing the allocation policies
   for these three registries to mark some of the code points as
   assigned for Experimental Use.  See [RFC3692] for further discussion
   of the use of experimental codepoints.

2.  PCEP Messages

   PCEP message types are in the range 0 to 255.  This document sets
   aside message types 252-255 for experimentation as described in
   Section 6.1.

3.  PCEP Objects

   PCEP objects are identified by values in the range 0 to 255.  This
   document sets aside object identifiers 248-255 for experimentation as
   described in Section 6.2.

4.  PCEP TLVs

   PCEP TLV type codes are in the range 0 to 65535.  This document sets
   aside object identifiers 65504-65535 for experimentation as described
   in Section 6.2.

5.  Handling of Unknown Experimentation

   A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental PCEP message,
   that it does not recognize, would react as per section 6.9 of
   [RFC5440] by sending a PCErr message with Error-value=2 (capability
   not supported).

   A PCE that does not recognize an experimental PCEP object, will
   reject the entire PCEP message and send a PCE error message with
   Error- Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported object" as described
   in [RFC5440].

   As per section 7.1 of [RFC5440], unknown experimental PCEP TLV would
   be ignored.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep>.

6.1.  New PCEP Messages

   Within this registry IANA maintains a sub-registry for PCEP Messages
   (see PCEP Messages at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep>).

   IANA is requested to change the registration procedure for this
   registry to read as follows:

      0-251   IETF Review
      252-255 Experimental Use

   IANA is also requested to mark the values 252-255 in the registry
   accordingly.

6.2.  New PCEP Objects

   Within this registry IANA maintains a sub-registry for PCEP Objects
   (see PCEP Objects at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep>).

   IANA is requested to change the registration procedure for this
   registry to read as follows:

      0-247   IETF Review
      248-255 Experimental Use

   IANA is also requested to mark the values 248-255 in the registry
   accordingly.

6.3.  New PCEP TLVs

   Within this registry IANA maintains a sub-registry for PCEP TLVs (see
   PCEP TLV Type Indicators at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/pcep>).

   IANA is requested to change the registration procedure for this
   registry to read as follows:

      0-65503     IETF Review
      65504-65535 Experimental Use

   IANA is also requested to mark the values 65504-65535 in the registry
   accordingly.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations to
   the existing protocol.  Refer to [RFC5440] for further details of the
   specific security measures.

   [RFC3692] asserts that the existence of experimental code points
   introduce no new security considerations.  However, implementations
   accepting experimental codepoints need to take care in how they parse
   and process the messages, objects, and TLVs in case they come,
   accidentally from another experiment.

Appendix A.  Other PCEP Registries

   Based on the feedback from the WG, it was decided to focus only on
   the essentials in the scope of this documents.  For others,
   Experiments can use a new experimental TLV/Object instead.
