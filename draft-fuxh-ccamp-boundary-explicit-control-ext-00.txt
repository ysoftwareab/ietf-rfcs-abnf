  RSVP-TE Signaling Extension for Explicit Control of Region Boundary
           draft-fuxh-ccamp-boundary-explicit-control-ext-00

Abstract

   [draft-fuxh-pce-boundary-explicit-control-framework-00] defines the
   framework for explicit control of region boundary in PCE-based inter-
   layer architecture.  This document defines the RSVP-TE extension for
   region boundaries explicit control.

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE for Region Boundary Control        March 2010


1.  Introduction

   [draft-fuxh-pce-boundary-explicit-control-framework-00] defines the
   framework for explicit control of region boundary in PCE-based inter-
   layer architecture.  There is a requirements for RSVP-TE extensions
   to support explicit control of region boundary.  A new object could
   be introduced in RSVP-TE signaling message.


2.  ERBO (Explicit Region Boundary Object)

   The format of ERBO object is the same as an ERO.  The ERBO including
   the region boundaries information can be carried in Path message.


3.  RSVP-TE Extension

   The Pathe message is extended as followings:


          <Path Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                        [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ... ]
                        [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                        <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                        <TIME_VALUES>
                        [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                        [ < ERBO > ]
                        <LABEL_REQUEST>
                        [ <PROTECTION> ]
                        [ <LABEL_SET> ... ]
                        [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                        [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                        [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                        [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                        <sender descriptor>
           <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                              [ <ADSPEC> ]
                              [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]
                              [ <SUGGESTED_LABEL> ]
                              [ <RECOVERY_LABEL> ]
                              <UPSTREAM_LABEL>
