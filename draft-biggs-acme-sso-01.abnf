provider-domain-name = issuer-domain-name ; see RFC 8659
ssoproviders = [\*(provider-domain-name ",") provider-domain-name]

validationmethods=smime-01,sso-01 \
ssoproviders=idp1.example.net,idp2.example.net"

   The presence of this parameter MUST be regarded by compliant CAs as a
   restriction on the set of providers they are allowed to rely upon for
   "sso-01" type challenges.  However, an implementation MAY choose to
   not rely upon any one or all providers named in this property.
   If this parameter is present but has a zero-length value,
   implementations MUST NOT rely on any SSO provider.  Since the "sso-
   01" challenge requires an SSO provider, the effect is thus the same
   as if the "validationmethods" parameter were present and did not
   include "sso-01".
