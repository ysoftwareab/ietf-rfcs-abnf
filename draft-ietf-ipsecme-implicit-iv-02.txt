Implicit IV for Counter-based Ciphers in Encapsulating Security Payload
                                 (ESP)
                   draft-ietf-ipsecme-implicit-iv-02

Abstract

   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector
   (IV) or nonce in each packet.  The size of IV depends on the applied
   transform, being usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined by
   the time this document is written.  Some algorithms such as AES-GCM,
   AES-CCM, AES-CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305 require a unique nonce but do
   not require an unpredictable nonce.  When using such algorithms the
   packet counter value can be used to generate a nonce.  This avoids
   sending the nonce itself, and savec in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM,
   AES-CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305 8 octets per packet.  This document
   describes how to do this.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Counter-based AES modes of operation such as AES-CTR ([RFC3686]),
   AES-CCM ([RFC4309]), and AES-GCM ([RFC4106]) require the
   specification of an nonce for each ESP packet.  The same applies for
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 ([RFC7634].  Currently this nonce is sent in each
   ESP packet ([RFC4303]).  This practice is designated in this document
   as "explicit nonce".

   In some context, such as IoT, it may be preferable to avoid carrying
   the extra bytes associated to the IV and instead generate it locally
   on each peer.  The local generation of the nonce is designated in
   this document as "implicit IV".

   The size of this nonce depends on the specific algorithm, but all of
   the algorithms mentioned above take an 8-octet nonce.

Internet-Draft             Implicit IV in ESP                 March 2018


   This document defines how to compute the nonce locally when it is
   implicit.  It also specifies how peers agree with the Internet Key
   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2 - [RFC7296]) on using an implicit IV versus
   an explicit IV.

   This document limits its scope to the algorithms mentioned above.
   Other algorithms with similar properties may later be defined to use
   this extension.

   This document does not consider AES-CBC ([RFC3602]) as AES-CBC
   requires the IV to be unpredictable.  Deriving it directly from the
   packet counter as described below is insecure as mentioned in
   Security Consideration of [RFC3602] and has led to real world chosen
   plain-text attack such as BEAST [BEAST].

3.  Terminology

   o  IoT: Internet of Things.

   o  IV: Initialization Vector.

   o  IIV: Implicit Initialization Vector.

   o  Nonce: a fixed-size octet string used only once.  This is similar
      to IV, except that in common usage there is no implication of non-
      predictability.

4.  Implicit IV

   With the algorithms listed in Section 2, the 8 byte nonce MUST NOT
   repeat.  The binding between a ESP packet and its nonce is provided
   using the Sequence Number or the Extended Sequence Number.  Figure 1
   and Figure 2 represent the IV with a regular 4-byte Sequence Number
   and with an 8-byte Extended Sequence Number respectively.

   o  Extended Sequence Number: the 8 byte Extended Sequence Number of
      the Security Association.  The 4 byte low order bytes are carried
      in the ESP packet.

   As the IV MUST NOT repeat for one SPI when Counter-Mode ciphers are
   used, Implicit IV as described in this document MUST NOT be used in
   setups with the chance that the Sequence Number overlaps for one SPI.
   Multicast as described in [RFC5374], [RFC6407] and
   [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] is a prominent example, where many senders share
   one secret and thus one SPI.  Section 3.5 of [RFC6407] provides a
   mechanism that MAY be used to prevent IV collisions when the same key
   is used by multiple users.  The mechanism consists in partitioning
   the IV space between users by assigning the most significant byte to
   a user.  When implicit IV transforms are used, such mechanism cannot
   be applied as the IV is not sent, but instead it is derived from the
   Sequence Number.  A similar mechanism could be used by associating
   the most significant byte of the Sequence Number to a sender, while
   the 3 remaining bytes will be used to carry the counter value.  Such
   mechanism prevents the use of Extended Sequence Number and limits the
   number of packet to be sent to 2** 24 = 16777216, that is 16 M.

   Unless some mechanism are provided to avoid collision between
   Sequence Number, ( and so IV ), Implicit IV MUST NOT be used.

5.  Initiator Behavior

   An initiator supporting this feature SHOULD propose implicit IV for
   all relevant algorithms.  To facilitate backward compatibility with
   non-supporting peers the initiator SHOULD also include those same
   algorithms without Implicit IV (IIV).  This may require extra
   transforms.

6.  Responder Behavior

   The rules of SA payload processing ensure that the responder will
   never send an SA payload containing the IIV transform to an initiator
   that does not support IIV.

7.  Security Consideration

   Nonce generation for these algorithms has not been explicitly
   defined.  It has been left to the implementation as long as certain
   security requirements are met.  Typically, for AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-
   CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the IV is not allowed being repeated for
   one particular key.  This document provides an explicit and normative
   way to generate IVs.  The mechanism described in this document meets
   the IV security requirements of all relevant algorithms.

8.  IANA Considerations

   AES-CCM, AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 are likely to implement the
   implicit IV described in this document.  This section limits
   assignment of new code points to the recommended suites provided in
   [RFC8221], thus the new Transform Type 1 - Encryption Algorithm
   Transform IDs [IANA] are as defined below:

   -  ENCR_AES_CCM_8_IIV

   -  ENCR_AES_GCM_16_IIV

   -  ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305_IIV

   These algorithms should be added with this document as ESP Reference
   and "Not Allowed" for IKEv2 Reference.

9.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thanks people Valery Smyslov for their valuable
   comments, David Schinazi for its implementation, as well as the
   ipseceme chairs Tero Kivinen and David Waltermire for moving this
   work forward.
