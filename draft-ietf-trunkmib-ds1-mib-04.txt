Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for
   managing DS1, E1, DS2 and E2 interfaces.  This document is a
   companion document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS0,
   DS3/E3 and SONET/SDH Interface Types, rfcTBD [19], rfcTBD [17] and
   rfcTBD [18].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

   This document entirely replaces RFC 1406.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework


   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol
        for accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

2.1.  Changes from RFC1406

   The changes from RFC1406 are the following:

        (1)  The Fractional Table has been deprecated

        (2)  This document uses SNMPv2 SMI

        (3)  Usage is given for ifTable and ifXTable

        (4)  Example usage of ifStackTable is included

        (5)  dsx1IfIndex has been deprecated

        (6)  Support for DS2 and E2 have been added

        (7)  An additional lineType for unframed E1 was added

        (8)  The definition of valid intervals has been clarified
             for the case where the agent proxied for other
             devices.  In particular, the treatment of missing
             intervals has been clarified.

        (9)  An inward loopback has been added.

        (10) Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End
             in Unavailable Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of
             Service, DS2 Payload AIS, and DS2 Performance Threshold

        (11) A read-write line Length object has been added.

        (12) Signal mode of other has been added.

INTERNET-DRAFT             DS1/E1/DS2/E2 MIB              September 1996


        (13) Added a lineStatus last change, trap and enabler.

        (14) dsx1CircuitIdentifier has been deprecated since the
             object ifPhysAddress is available for all levels
             through interface stacking.

        (15) The e1(19) ifType has been obsoleted so this MIB
             does not list it as a supported ifType.

        (16) Textual Conventions for statistics objects have
             been used.

        (17) A new object, dsx1LoopbackStatus has been introduced
             to reflect the loopbacks established on a DS1 interface
             and the source to the requests.  dsx1LoopbackConfig
             continues to be the desired loopback state while
             dsx1LoopbackStatus reflects the actual state.

INTERNET-DRAFT             DS1/E1/DS2/E2 MIB              September 1996


3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS1/E1/DS2/E2 interface.  At present, this
   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-
   standard MIB:

        ds1 (18)

   The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T T-1 Superframe
   (a.k.a., D4) and Extended Superframe (ESF) formats [6, 7], the latter
   of which conforms to ANSI specifications [8], and the CCITT
   Recommendations [9, 10], referred to as E1 for the rest of this memo.

   The various DS1 and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that
   separate MIBs are unwarranted, although there are some differences.
   For example, Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF
   specification than in the D4 specification, but it is defined in
   both.  Therefore,  interface types e1(19) and g703at2mb(67) have been
   obsoleted.


   Where it is necessary to distinguish between the flavors of E1 with
   and without CRC, E1-CRC denotes the "with CRC" form (G.704 Table 4b)
   and E1-noCRC denotes the "without CRC" form (G.704 Table 4a).

3.1.  Use of ifTable for DS1 Layer

   Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.

                             this object should have an octet string

                              false(2) is appropriate


3.2.  Usage Guidelines

3.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable

   The object dsx1IfIndex has been deprecated.  This object previously
   allowed a very special proxy situation to exist for Routers and CSUs.
   This section now describes how to use ifStackTable to represent this
   relationship.

   The paragraphs discussing dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex have been
   preserved in Appendix A for informational purposes.

   The ifStackTable is used in the proxy case to represent the
   association between pairs of interfaces, e.g. this T1 is attached to
   that T1.  This use is consistent with the use of the ifStackTable to
   show the association between various sub-layers of an interface.  In
   both cases entire PDUs are exchanged between the interface pairs - in
   the case of a T1, entire T1 frames are exchanged; in the case of PPP
   and HDLC, entire HDLC frames are exchanged.  This usage is not meant
   to suggest the use of the ifStackTable to represent Time Division
   Multiplexing (TDM) connections in general.

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agent resides on a
   host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various DS1 interfaces.

3.2.2.  Usage of Loopbacks   This section discusses the behaviour of
objects related to loopbacks.

The object dsx1LoopbackConfig represents the desired state of loopbacks
on this interface.  Using this object a Manager can request:
    LineLoopback
    PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)

INTERNET-DRAFT             DS1/E1/DS2/E2 MIB              September 1996


    InwardLoopback
    NoLoopback

The remote end can also request lookbacks either through the FDL channel
if ESF or inband if D4.  The loopbacks that can be request this way are:
    LineLoopback
    PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)
    NoLoopback

To model the current state of loopbacks on a DS1 interface, the object
dsx1LoopbackStatus defines which loopback is currently applies to an
interface.  This objects, which is a bitmap, will have bits turned on
which reflect the currently active loopbacks on the interface as well as
the source of those loopbacks.

The following restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:

The far end cannot undo loopbacks set by a manager.

A manager can undo loopbacks set by the far end.

Both a line loopback and an inward loopback can be set at the same time.
Only these two loopbacks can co-exist and either one may be set by the
manager or the far end.


3.3.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS1
   signals:  the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   all devices with DS1 interfaces.  As such, a design decision was made
   up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects that
   can generally be read from DS1 devices that are currently deployed.

3.4.  DS1 Terminology

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a DS1 interface as monitored by a DS1 device are based on the late
   but not final draft of what became the ANSI T1.231 standard [11].  If
   the definition in this document does not match the definition in the
   ANSI T1.231 document, the implementer should follow the definition
   described in this document.

3.4.1.  Error Events

     Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
          A BPV error event for an AMI-coded signal is the occurrence of
          a pulse of the same polarity as the previous pulse.  (See
          T1.231 Section 6.1.1.1.1) A BPV error event for a B8ZS- or
          HDB3- coded signal is the occurrence of a pulse of the same
          polarity as the previous pulse without being a part of the
          zero substitution code.

     Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error Event
          An Excessive Zeroes error event for an AMI-coded signal is the
          occurrence of more than fifteen contiguous zeroes.  (See
          T1.231 Section 6.1.1.1.2) For a B8ZS coded signal, the defect
          occurs when more than seven contiguous zeroes are detected.

      Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event
          A Line Coding Violation (LCV) is the occurrence of either a
          Bipolar Violation (BPV) or Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error Event.
          (Also known as CV-L; See T1.231 Section 6.5.1.1)

     Path Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event
          A Path Coding Violation error event is a frame synchronization
          bit error in the D4 and E1-noCRC formats, or a CRC or frame
          synch. bit error in the ESF and E1-CRC formats. (Also known as
          CV-P; See T1.231 Section 6.5.2.1)

     Controlled Slip (CS) Error Event
          A Controlled Slip is the replication or deletion of the
          payload bits of a DS1 frame.  (See T1.231 Section 6.1.1.2.3) A
          Controlled Slip may be performed when there is a difference
          between the timing of a synchronous receiving terminal and the
          received signal.  A Controlled Slip does not cause an Out of
          Frame defect.

3.4.2.  Performance Defects

     Out Of Frame (OOF) Defect
          An OOF defect is the occurrence of a particular density of
          Framing Error events. (See T1.231 Section 6.1.2.2.1)

          For DS1 links, an Out of Frame defect is declared when the
          receiver detects two or more framing errors within a 3 msec
          period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4 signals, or two or
          more errors out of five or fewer consecutive framing-bits.

INTERNET-DRAFT             DS1/E1/DS2/E2 MIB              September 1996


          For E1 links, an Out Of Frame defect is declared when three
          consecutive frame alignment signals have been received with an
          error (see G.706 Section 4.1 [15]).

          For DS2 links, an Out of Frame defect is declared when 7 or
          more consecutive errored framing patterns (4 multiframe) are
          received.  The LOF is cleared when 3 or more consecutive
          correct framing patterns are received.

          Once an Out Of Frame Defect is declared, the framer starts
          searching for a correct framing pattern.  The Out of Frame
          defect ends when the signal is in frame.

          In-frame occurs when there are fewer than two frame bit errors
          within 3 msec period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4
          signals.

          For E1 links, in-frame occurs when a) in frame N the frame
          alignment signal is correct and b) in frame N+1 the frame
          alignment signal is absent (i.e., bit 2 in TS0 is a one) and
          c) in frame N+2 the frame alignment signal is present and
          correct. (See G.704 Section 4.1)

     Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) Defect
          For D4 and ESF links, the 'all ones' condition is detected at
          a DS1 line interface upon observing an unframed signal with a
          one's density of at least 99.9% present for a time equal to or
          greater than T, where 3 ms <= T <= 75 ms.  The AIS is
          terminated upon observing a signal not meeting the one's
          density or the unframed signal criteria for a period equal to
          or greater than than T. (See G.775, Section 5.4)

          For E1 links, the 'all-ones' condition is detected at the line
          interface as a string of 512 bits containing fewer than three
          zero bits (see O.162 [12] Section 3.3.2).

          For DS2 links, the DS2 AIS shall be sent from the NT1 to the
          user to indicate a loss of the 6,312 kbps frame capability on
          the network side.  The DS2 AIS is defined as a bit array of
          6,312 kbps in which all binary bits are set to '1'.

          The DS2 AIS detection and removal shall be implemented
          according to ITU-T Draft Recommendation G.775[20] Section 5.5:
          - a DS2 AIS defect is detected when the incoming signal has
          two (2) or less ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits (0.5 ms).

          - a DS2 AIS defect is cleared when the incoming signal has
          three (3) or more ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits (0.5 ms).


3.4.3.  Performance Parameters

   All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute
   intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an
   agent.  Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the
   agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition,
   there is a rolling 24-hour total of each performance parameter.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of types PerfCurrentCount,
   PerfIntervalCount and PerfTotalCount.  These textual conventions are
   all Gauge32, and they are used because it is possible for these
   objects to decrease.  Objects may decrease when Unavailable Seconds
   occurs across a fifteen minutes interval boundary. See Unavailable
   Seconds discussion later in this section.

     Line Errored Seconds (LES)
          A Line Errored Second is a second in which one or more Line
          Code Violation error events were detected. (Also known as ES-
          L; See T1.231 Section 6.5.1.2)


     Controlled Slip Seconds (CSS)
          A Controlled Slip Second is a one-second interval containing
          one or more controlled slips.  (See T1.231 Section 6.5.2.8)
          This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.

     Errored Seconds (ES)
          For ESF and E1-CRC links an Errored Second is a second with
          one or more Path Code Violation OR one or more Out of Frame
          defects OR one or more Controlled Slip events OR a detected
          AIS defect. (See T1.231 Section 6.5.2.2 and G.826[22] Section
          B.1)

          For D4 and E1-noCRC links, the presence of Bipolar Violations
          also triggers an Errored Second.

          This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.

     Bursty Errored Seconds (BES)
          A Bursty Errored Second (also known as Errored Second type B
          in T1.231 Section 6.5.2.4) is a second with fewer than 320 and
          more than 1 Path Coding Violation error events, no Severely
          Errored Frame defects and no detected incoming AIS defects.
          Controlled slips are not included in this parameter.

          This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.  It
          applies to ESF signals only.

     Severely Errored Seconds (SES)
          A Severely Errored Second for ESF signals is a second with 320
          or more Path Code Violation Error Events OR one or more Out of
          Frame defects OR a detected AIS defect. (See T1.231 Section
          6.5.2.5)

          For E1-CRC signals, a Severely Errored Second is a second with
          832 or more Path Code Violation error events OR one or more
          Out of Frame defects.

          For E1-noCRC signals, a Severely Errored Second is a 2048 LCVs
          or more.

          For D4 signals, a Severely Errored Second is a count of one-
          second intervals with Framing Error events, or an OOF defect,
          or 1544 LCVs or more.

          Controlled slips are not included in this parameter.

          This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.

     Severely Errored Framing Second (SEFS)
          An Severely Errored Framing Second is a second with one or
          more Out of Frame defects OR a detected AIS defect.  (Also
          known as SAS-P (SEF/AIS second); See T1.231 Section 6.5.2.6)

     Degraded Minutes
          A Degraded Minute is one in which the estimated error rate
          exceeds 1E-6 but does not exceed 1E-3 (see G.821[13]).

          Degraded Minutes are determined by collecting all of the
          Available Seconds, removing any Severely Errored Seconds
          grouping the result in 60-second long groups and counting a

          60-second long group (a.k.a., minute) as degraded if the
          cumulative errors during the seconds present in the group
          exceed 1E-6.  Available seconds are merely those seconds which
          are not Unavailable as described below.

     Unavailable Seconds (UAS)
          Unavailable Seconds (UAS) are calculated by counting the
          number of seconds that the interface is unavailable.  The DS1
          interface is said to be unavailable from the onset of 10
          contiguous SESs, or the onset of the condition leading to a
          failure (see Failure States).  If the condition leading to the
          failure was immediately preceded by one or more contiguous
          SESs, then the DS1 interface unavailability starts from the
          onset of these SESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is
          present, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset of
          10 contiguous seconds with no SESs.  Once unavailable, and if
          a failure is present, the DS1 interface becomes available at
          the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, if the
          failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10 seconds.  If
          the failure clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the DS1
          interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous
          seconds with no SESs, or the onset period leading to the
          successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later.  With
          respect to the DS1 error counts, all counters are incremented
          while the DS1 interface is deemed available.  While the
          interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is
          incremented is UASs.

          Note that this definition implies that the agent cannot
          determine until after a ten second interval has passed whether
          a given one-second interval belongs to available or
          unavailable time.  If the agent chooses to update the various
          performance statistics in real time then it must be prepared
          to retroactively reduce the ES, BES, SES, and SEFS counts by
          10 and increase the UAS count by 10 when it determines that
          available time has been entered.  It must also be prepared to
          adjust the PCV count and the DM count as necessary since these
          parameters are not accumulated during unavailable time.  It
          must be similarly prepared to retroactively decrease the UAS
          count by 10 and increase the ES, BES, and DM counts as
          necessary upon entering available time.  A special case exists
          when the 10 second period leading to available or unavailable
          time crosses a 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
          foregoing description implies that the ES, BES, SES, SEFS, DM,
          and UAS counts the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted.  In

          this case successive GETs of the affected dsx1IntervalSESs and
          dsx1IntervalUASs objects will return differing values if the
          first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the window.

          The agent may instead choose to delay updates to the various
          statistics by 10 seconds in order to avoid retroactive
          adjustments to the counters.  A way to do this is sketched in
          Appendix B.

          In any case, a linkDown trap shall be sent only after the
          agent has determined for certain that the unavailable state
          has been entered, but the time on the trap will be that of the
          first UAS (i.e., 10 seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall be
          handled similarly.

          According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the
          _onset_ of 10 contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is,
          unavailable time starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous
          SESs.  Also, while an interface is deemed unavailable all
          counters for that interface are frozen except for the UAS
          count.  It follows that an implementation which strictly
          complies with this standard must _not_ increment any counters
          other than the UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result of
          anything that happens during those 10 seconds.  Since changes
          in the signal state lag the data to which they apply by 10
          seconds, an ANSI-compliant implementation must pass the the
          one-second statistics through a 10-second delay line prior to
          updating any counters.  That can be done by performing the
          following steps at the end of each one second interval.

   i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status flags from the
        hardware.

   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the preceding second and
        compare them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer
        in question.  Update the signal state and shift the
        one-second CV counts and ES/SES flags into the 10-element
        delay line.  Note that far-end one-second statistics are
        to be flagged as "absent" during any second in which there
        is an incoming defect at the layer in question or at any
        lower layer.

   iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal
        state from the _previous_ update cycle and the one-second
        CV counts and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element

        delay line.

   This approach is further described in Appendix B.

3.4.4.  Failure States

The following failure states are received, or detected failures, that
are reported in the dsx1LineStatus object.  When a DS1 interface would,
if ever, produce the conditions leading to the failure state is
described in the appropriate specification.

     Far End Alarm Failure
          The Far End Alarm failure is also known as "Yellow Alarm" in
          the DS1 case, "Distant Alarm" in the E1 case, and "Remote
          Alarm" in the DS2 case.

          For D4 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared when bit 6
          of all channels has been zero for at least 335 ms and is
          cleared when bit 6 of at least one channel is non-zero for a
          period T, where T is usually less than one second and always
          less than 5 seconds.  The Far End Alarm failure is not
          declared for D4 links when a Loss of Signal is detected.

          For ESF links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared if the
          Yellow Alarm signal pattern occurs in at least seven out of
          ten contiguous 16-bit pattern intervals and is cleared if the
          Yellow Alarm signal pattern does not occur in ten contiguous
          16-bit signal pattern intervals.

          For E1 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared when bit 3
          of time-slot zero is received set to one on two consecutive
          occasions.  The Far End Alarm failure is cleared when bit 3 of
          time-slot zero is received set to zero.

          For DS2 links, if a loss of frame alignment (LOF or LOS)
          and/or DS2 AIS condition, is detected, the RAI signal shall be
          generated and transmitted to the remote side.

          The Remote Alarm Indication(RAI) signal is defined on m-bits
          as a repetition of the 16bit sequence consisting of eight
          binary '1s' and eight binary '0s' in m-bits(1111111100000000).
          When the RAI signal is not sent (in normal operation),the HDLC
          flag pattern (01111110) in the m-bit is sent.

          The RAI failure is detected when 16 or more consecutive RAI-

          patterns (1111111100000000) are received.  The RAI failure is
          cleared when 4 or more consecutive incorrect-RAI-patterns are
          received.

     Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) Failure
          The Alarm Indication Signal failure is declared when an AIS
          defect is detected at the input and the  AIS defect still
          exists after the Loss Of Frame failure (which is caused by the
          unframed nature of the 'all-ones' signal) is declared. The AIS
          failure is cleared when the Loss Of Frame failure is cleared.
          (See T1.231 Section 6.2.1.2.1)

          An AIS defect at a 6312 kbit/s (G.704) interface is detected
          when the incoming signal has two {2} or less ZEROs in a
          sequence of 3156 bits (0.5ms).

          The AIS signal defect is cleared when the incoming signal has
          three {3} or more ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits (0.5ms).

     Loss Of Frame Failure
          For DS1 links, the Loss Of Frame failure is declared when an
          OOF or LOS  defect has persisted for T seconds, where 2 <= T
          <= 10.  The Loss Of Frame failure is cleared when there have
          been no OOF or LOS defects during a period T where 0 <= T <=
          20.  Many systems will perform "hit integration" within the
          period T before declaring or clearing the failure e.g., see TR
          62411 [14].

          For E1 links, the Loss Of Frame Failure is declared when an
          OOF defect is detected.

     Loss Of Signal Failure
          For DS1, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared upon observing
          175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
          positive or negative polarity.  The LOS failure is cleared
          upon observing an average pulse density of at least 12.5% over
          a period of 175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions starting
          with the receipt of a pulse.

          For E1 links, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared when
          greater than 10 consecutive zeroes are detected (see O.162
          Section 3.4`<.4).

          A LOS defect at 6312kbit/s interfaces is detected when the
          incoming signal has "no transitions", i.e. when the signal

          level is less than or equal to a signal level of 35dB below
          nominal, for N consecutive pulse intervals, where 10 <=N<=255.

          The LOS defect is cleared when the incoming signal has
          "transitions", i.e. when the signal level is greater than or
          equal to a signal level of 9dB below nominal, for N
          consecutive pulse intervals, where 10<=N<=255.

          A signal with "transitions" corresponds to a G.703 compliant
          signal.

     Loopback Pseudo-Failure
          The Loopback Pseudo-Failure is declared when the near end
          equipment has placed a loopback (of any kind) on the DS1.
          This allows a management entity to determine from one object
          whether the DS1 can be considered to be in service or not
          (from the point of view of the near end equipment).

     TS16 Alarm Indication Signal Failure
          For E1 links, the TS16 Alarm Indication Signal failure is
          declared when time-slot 16 is received as all ones for all
          frames of two consecutive multiframes (see G.732 Section
          4.2.6).  This condition is never declared for DS1.

     Loss Of MultiFrame Failure
          The Loss Of MultiFrame failure is declared when two
          consecutive multiframe alignment signals (bits 4 through 7 of
          TS16 of frame 0) have been received with an error.  The Loss
          Of Multiframe failure is cleared when the first correct
          multiframe alignment signal is received.  The Loss Of
          Multiframe failure can only be declared for E1 links operating
          with G.732 [16] framing (sometimes called "Channel Associated
          Signalling" mode).

     Far End Loss Of Multiframe Failure
          The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure is declared when bit 2
          of TS16 of frame 0 is received set to one on two consecutive
          occasions.  The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure is cleared
          when bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is received set to zero.  The
          Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure can only be declared for E1
          links operating in "Channel Associated Signalling" mode. (See
          G.732)

     DS2 Payload AIS Failure
          The DS2 Payload AIS is detected when the incoming signal of

          the 6,312 kbps frame payload [TS1-TS96] has 2 or less 0's in a
          sequence of 3072 bits (0.5ms).  The DS2 Payload AIS is cleared
          when the incoming signal of the 6,312 kbps frame payload
          [TS1-TS96] has 3 or more 0's in a sequence of 3072 bits (0.5
          ms).

     DS2 Performance Threshold
          DS2 Performance Threshold Failure monitors equipment
          performance and is based on the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
          Procedure defined in G.704.

          The DS2 Performance Threshold Failure is detected when the bit
          error ratio exceeds 10^-4 (Performance Threshold), and the DS2
          Performance Threshold Failure shall be cleared when the bit
          error ratio decreased to less than 10^-6."

                      supporting read/write access should return
                      badValue in response to a requested loopback state
                      that the interface does not support.  The values

                      dsx1NoLoop
                       Not in the loopback state.  A device that is not
                      capable of performing a loopback on the interface
                      shall always return this as its value.

                      dsx1PayloadLoop
                       The received signal at this interface is looped
                      through the device.  Typically the received signal
                      is looped back for retransmission after it has
                      passed through the device's framing function.

                      dsx1LineLoop
                       The received signal at this interface does not go
                      through the device (minimum penetration) but is
                      looped back out.

                      dsx1OtherLoop
                       Loopbacks that are not defined here.

                      dsx1InwardLoop
                       The transmitted signal at this interface is
                      looped back and received by the same interface.
                      What is transmitted onto the line is product

               SYNTAX  SEQUENCE OF Dsx1FracEntry
               MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
               STATUS  deprecated
               DESCRIPTION
                      "This table is deprecated in favour of using
                      ifStackTable.

                      The table was mandatory for systems dividing a DS1
                      into channels containing different data streams
                      that are of local interest.  Systems which are
                      indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need
                      not implement it.

                      The DS1 fractional table identifies which DS1
                      channels associated with a CSU are being used to
                      support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the
                      interfaces table from the Internet-standard MIB.

                      For example, consider an application managing a
                      North American ISDN Primary Rate link whose
                      division is a 384 kbit/s H1 _B_ Channel for Video,
                      a second H1 for data to a primary routing peer,
                      and 12 64 kbit/s H0 _B_ Channels. Consider that
                      some subset of the H0 channels are used for voice
                      and the remainder are available for dynamic data
                      calls.

                      We count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed onto
                      the DS1 interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake
                      of the example, channels 1..6) are used for Video,
                      six more (7..11 and 13) are used for data, and the
                      remaining 12 are are in channels 12 and 14..24.

                      Let us further imagine that ifIndex 2 is of type
                      DS1 and refers to the DS1 interface, and that the
                      interfaces layered onto it are numbered 3..16.

                      We might describe the allocation of channels, in
                      the dsx1FracTable, as follows:
                    dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.13 = 4
                    dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.14 = 6
                    dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.15 = 7
                    dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.16 = 8

                      legal channels, numbered 1 through 24.

                      For G.704 interfaces, there are 31 legal channels,
                      numbered 1 through 31.  The channels (1..31)
                      correspond directly to the equivalently numbered

5.  Appendix A - Use of dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex

   This Appendix exists to document the previous use if dsx1IfIndex and
   dsx1LineIndex and to clarify the relationship of dsx1LineIndex as
   defined in rfc1406 with the dsx1LineIndex as defined in this
   document.

   The following shows the old and new definitions and the relationship:

   [New Definition]: "This object should be made equal to ifIndex.  The
   next paragraph describes its previous usage.  Making the object equal
   to ifIndex allows proper use of ifStackTable and ds0/ds0bundle mibs.

   [Old Definition]: "This object is the identifier of a DS1 Interface
   on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is directly
   associated with this and only this DS1 interface, it should have the
   same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the dsx1LineIndices with an
   unique identifier following the rules of choosing a number that is
   greater than ifNumber and numbering the inside interfaces (e.g.,
   equipment side) with even numbers and outside interfaces (e.g,
   network side) with odd numbers."

   When the "Old Definition" was created, it was described this way to
   allow a manager to treat the value _as if_ it were and ifIndex, i.e.

   the value would either be:  1) an ifIndex value or 2) a value that
   was guaranteed to be different from all valid ifIndex values.

   The new definition is a subset of that definition, i.e. the value is
   always an ifIndex value.

   The following is Section 3.1 from rfc1406:

   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS1
   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different
   indices for DS1 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These indices
   are dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex.

   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed
   DS1 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing on
   the device supporting DS1 interfaces directly):

   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal
   to ifIndex, and the following applies:

      ifIndex=dsx1IfIndex=dsx1LineIndex for all interfaces.

   The dsx1IfIndex column of the DS1 Configuration table relates each
   DS1 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the
   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC1213).

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.  The
   index dsx1LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS1 interfaces
   external from the host/DS1-device combination, but also the DS1
   interfaces connecting the host and the DS1 device.  The index
   dsx1IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

           ifIndex (= dsx1IfIndex)                     dsx1LineIndex
                   1                   NA                  NA (Ethernet)
                   2      Line#A   Router Side             6
                   2      Line#A   Network Side            7
                   3      Line#B   Router Side             8
                   3      Line#B   Network Side            9
                   4      Line#C   Router Side            10
                   4      Line#C   Network Side           11
                   5      Line#D   Router Side            12
                   5      Line#D   Network Side           13

   For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.  Note the following
   description of dsx1LineIndex:  the dsx1LineIndex identifies a DS1
   Interface on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is
   directly associated with this and only this DS1 interface, it should
   have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the
   dsx1LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of
   choosing a number greater than ifNumber and numbering inside
   interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside
   interfaces (e.g., network side) with odd numbers.

   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the
   situation would be:

           ifIndex (= dsx1IfIndex)                      dsx1LineIndex
                   1      Line#A     Network Side            1
                   2      Line#A     RouterSide              2
                   3      Line#B     Network Side            3
                   4      Line#B     RouterSide              4

6.  Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.

   This procedure is illustrated below for a DS1 ESF interface.  Similar
   rules would apply for other DS1, DS2, and E1 interface variants.  The
   procedure guarantees that the statistical counters are correctly
   updated at all times, although they lag real time by 10 seconds.  At
   the end of each 15 minutes interval the current interval counts are
   transferred to the  most recent interval entry and each interval is
   shifted up by one position, with the oldest being discarded if
   necessary in order to make room.  The current interval counts then
   start over from zero.  Note, however, that the signal state
   calculation does not start afresh at each interval boundary;  rather,
   signal state information is retained across interval boundaries.

   Note that if such a procedure is adopted there is no current interval
   data for the first ten seconds after a system comes up.
   noSuchInstance must be returned if a management station attempts to
   access the current interval counters during this time.

   It is an implementation-specific matter whether an agent assumes that
   the initial state of the interface is available or unavailable.
