Introduction</h3>

<p>This document outlines how Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> can be used for RTP <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> flows running over UDP/IP which use RTCP as
      feedback mechanism. The solution consists of feedback of ECN congestion
      experienced markings to sender using RTCP, verification of ECN
      functionality end-to-end, and how to initiate ECN usage. The initiation
      process will have some dependencies on the signalling mechanism used to
      establish the RTP session, a specification for mechanisms using SDP is
      included.
</p>
<p>ECN is getting attention as a method to minimise the impact of
      congestion on real-time multimedia traffic. When ECN is used, the
      network can signal to applications that congestion is occurring, whether
      that congestion is due to queuing at a congested link, limited resources
      and coverage on a radio link, or other reasons. This congestion signal
      allows applications to reduce their transmission rate in a controlled
      manner, rather than responding to uncontrolled packet loss, and so
      improves the user experience while benefiting the network.
</p>
<p>The introduction of ECN into the Internet requires changes to both
      the network and transport layers. At the network layer, IP forwarding
      has to be updated to allow routers to mark packets, rather than
      discarding them in times of congestion <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      In addition, transport protocols have to be modified to inform that
      sender that ECN marked packets are being received, so it can respond to
      the congestion. <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>TCP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3168], <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>SCTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4960] and <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>DCCP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4340] have
      been updated to support ECN, but to date there is no specification how
      UDP-based transports, such as <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>RTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3550], can
      use ECN. This is due to the lack of feedback mechanism directly in UDP.
      Instead the protocol on top of UDP needs to provide that feedback, which
      for RTP is RTCP.

      describing the conventions, definitions and acronyms used in this memo

Discussion, Requirements, and Design Rationale</h3>

<p>ECN has been specified for use with <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>TCP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3168], <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>SCTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4960], and
      <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>DCCP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4340] transports. These are all unicast
      protocols which negotiate the use of ECN during the initial connection
      establishment handshake (supporting incremental deployment, and checking
      if ECN marked packets pass all middleboxes on the path). ECN Congestion
      Experienced (ECN-CE) marks are immediately echoed back to the sender by
      the receiving end-point using an additional bit in feedback messages,
      and the sender then interprets the mark as equivalent to a packet loss
      for congestion control purposes.
</p>
<p>If RTP is run over TCP, SCTP, or DCCP, it can use the native ECN
      support provided by those protocols. This memo does not concern itself
      further with these use cases. However, RTP is more commonly run over
      UDP. This combination does not currently support ECN, and we observe
      that it has significant differences from the other transport protocols
      for which ECN has been specified. These include: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Signalling:</dt>
<dd>RTP relies on separate signalling
          protocols to negotiate parameters before a session can be created,
          and doesn't include an in-band handshake or negotiation at session
          set-up time (i.e. there is no equivalent to the TCP three-way
          handshake in RTP).
</dd>
<dt>Feedback:</dt>
<dd>RTP does not explicitly acknowledge receipt
          of datagrams. Instead, the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) provides
          reception quality feedback, and other back channel communication,
          for RTP sessions. The feedback interval is generally on the order of
          seconds, rather than once per network RTT (although the RTP/AVPF
          profile <a class='info' href='#RFC4585'>[RFC4585]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ott, J., Wenger, S., Sato, N., Burmeister, C., and J. Rey, &ldquo;Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> allows more rapid feedback in
          some cases).
</dd>
<dt>Congestion Response:</dt>
<dd>While it is possible to adapt the
          transmission of many audio/visual streams in response to network
          congestion, and such adaptation is required by <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, the dynamics of the congestion response
          may be quite different to those of TCP or other transport
          protocols.
</dd>
<dt>Middleboxes:</dt>
<dd>The RTP framework explicitly supports the
          concept of mixers and translators, which are middleboxes that are
          involved in media transport functions.
</dd>
<dt>Multicast:</dt>
<dd>RTP is explicitly a group communication
          protocol, and was designed from the start to support IP multicast
          (primarily ASM, although a recent extension supports SSM with
          unicast feedback).
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p> These differences will significantly alter the shape of ECN
      support in RTP-over-UDP compared to ECN support in TCP, SCTP, and DCCP,
      but do not invalidate the need for ECN support. Indeed, in many ways,
      ECN support is more important for RTP sessions, since the impact of
      packet loss in real-time audio-visual media flows is highly visible to
      users. Effective ECN support for RTP flows running over UDP will allow
      real-time audio-visual applications to respond to the onset of
      congestion before routers are forced to drop packets, allowing those
      applications to control how they reduce their transmission rate, and
      hence media quality, rather than responding to, and trying to conceal
      the effects of, unpredictable packet loss. Furthermore, widespread
      deployment for ECN and active queue management in routers, should it
      occur, can potentially reduce unnecessary queueing delays in routers,
      lowering the round-trip time and benefiting interactive applications of
      RTP, such a voice telephony.

Requirements</h3>

<p>Considering ECN and these protocols one can create a set of

<ul class="text">
<li>REQ 1: A mechanism to negotiate and initiate the usage of ECN
            for RTP/UDP/IP sessions is required

<li>REQ 2: A mechanism to feedback the reception of any packets

<li>REQ 4: Some detection and fallback mechanism is needed to avoid

<li>REQ 5: Negotiation of ECN should not significantly increase the

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Applicability</h3>

<p>The use of ECN with RTP over UDP is dependent on negotiation of ECN
        capability between the sender and receiver(s), and validation of ECN
        support in all elements of the network path(s) traversed. RTP is used
        in a heterogeneous range of network environments and topologies, with
        various different signalling protocols, all of which need to be
        verified to support ECN before it can be used.
</p>
<p>The usage of ECN is further dependent on a capability of the RTP
        media flow to react to congestion signalled by ECN marked packets.
        Depending on the application, media codec, and network topology, this
        adaptation can occur at the sender by changing the media encoding, at
        the receiver by changing the subscription to a layered encoding, or in
        a transcoding middlebox. RFC 5117 identifies seven topologies in which
        RTP sessions may be configured, and which may affect the ability to
        use ECN: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Topo-Point-to-Point:</dt>
<dd>This is a standard unicast
            flow. ECN may be used with RTP in this topology in an analogous
            manner to its use with other unicast transport protocols, with
            RTCP conveying ECN feedback messages.
</dd>
<dt>Topo-Multicast:</dt>
<dd>This is either an any source
            multicast (ASM) group with potentially several active senders and
            multicast RTCP feedback, or a source specific multicast (SSM)
            group with a single sender and unicast RTCP feedback from
            receivers. RTCP is designed to scale to large group sizes while
            avoiding feedback implosion (see Section 6.2 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V.

Chesterfield, &ldquo;RTCP Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>), and can be used by a
            sender to determine if all its receivers, and the network paths to
            those receivers, support ECN (see <a class='info' href='#sec-initiation'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Initiation of ECN Use in an RTP Session</span><span>)</span></a>). It is somewhat more difficult to
            determine if all network paths from all senders to all receivers
            support ECN. Accordingly, we allow ECN to be used by an RTP sender
            using multicast UDP provided the sender has verified that the
            paths to all its known receivers support ECN, and irrespective of
            whether the paths from other senders to their receivers support
            ECN. Note that group membership may change during the lifetime of
            a multicast RTP session, potentially introducing new receivers
            that are not ECN capable. Senders must use the mechanisms
            described in <a class='info' href='#sec-ecn-failure'>Section&nbsp;4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Detecting Failures and Receiver Misbehaviour</span><span>)</span></a> to monitor
            that all receivers continue to support ECN, and needs to fallback
            to non-ECN use if they do not.
</dd>
<dt>Topo-Translator:</dt>
<dd>An RTP translator is an RTP-level
            middlebox that is invisible to the other participants in the RTP
            session (although it is usually visible in the associated
            signalling session). There are two types of RTP translator: those
            do not modify the media stream, and are concerned with transport
            parameters, for example a multicast to unicast gateway; and those
            that do modify the media stream, for example transcoding between
            different media codecs. A single RTP session traverses the
            translator, and the translator must rewrite RTCP messages passing
            through it to match the changes it makes to the RTP data packets.
            A legacy, ECN-unaware, RTP translator is expected to ignore the
            ECN bits on received packets, and zero out the ECN bits when
            sending packets, so causing ECN negotiation on the path containing
            the translator to fail (any new RTP translator that does not wish
            to support ECN may do similarly). An ECN aware RTP translator may
            act in one of three ways: 
<ul class="text">
<li>If the translator does not modify the media stream, it
                should copy the ECN bits unchanged from the incoming to the
                outgoing datagrams, unless it is overloaded and experiencing
                congestion, in which case it may mark the outgoing datagrams
                with an ECN-CE mark. Such a translator passes RTCP feedback
                unchanged.
</li>
<li>If the translator modifies the media stream to combine or
                split RTP packets, but does not otherwise transcode the media,
                it must manage the ECN bits in a way analogous to that
                described in Section 5.3 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>: if
                an ECN marked packet is split into two, then both the outgoing
                packets must be ECN marked identically to the original; if
                several ECN marked packets are combined into one, the outgoing
                packet must be either ECN-CE marked or dropped if any of the
                incoming packets are ECN-CE marked, and should be ECT marked
                if any of the incoming packets are ECT marked. When RTCP ECN
                feedback packets (<a class='info' href='#sec-rtcp-ecn'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP Extensions for ECN feedback</span><span>)</span></a>) are
                received, they must be rewritten to match the modifications
                made to the media stream (see <a class='info' href='#sec-rtcp-ecn-translator'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fragmentation and Reassembly in Translators</span><span>)</span></a>).
</li>
<li>If the translator is a media transcoder, the output RTP
                media stream may have radically different characteristics than
                the input RTP media stream. Each side of the translator must
                then be considered as a separate transport connection, with
                its own ECN processing. This requires the translator interpose
                itself into the ECN negotiation process, effectively splitting
                the connection into two parts with their own negotiation. Once
                negotiation has been completed, the translator must generate
                RTCP ECN feedback back to the source based on its own
                reception, and must respond to RTCP ECN feedback received from
                the receiver(s) (see <a class='info' href='#sec-rtcp-ecn-synthetic'>Section&nbsp;6.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Generating RTCP ECN Feedback in Translators</span><span>)</span></a>).
</li>
</ul> It is recognised that ECN and RTCP processing in an RTP
            translator that modifies the media stream is non-trivial.
</dd>
<dt>Topo-Mixer:</dt>
<dd>This is an RTP-level middlebox that
            aggregates multiple RTP streams, mixing them together to generate
            a new RTP stream. The mixer is visible to the other participants
            in the RTP session. The RTP flows on each side of the mixer are
            treated independently for ECN purposes, with the mixer generating
            its own RTCP ECN feedback, and responding to ECN feedback for data
            it sends. Since connections are treated independently, it would
            seem reasonable to allow the transport on one side of the mixer to
            use ECN, while the transport on the other side of the mixer is not
            ECN capable, if this is desired.
</dd>
<dt>Topo-Video-switch-MCU:</dt>
<dd>A video switching MCU
            receives several RTP flows, but forwards only one of those flows
            onwards to the other participants at a time. The flow that is
            forwarded changes during the session, often based on voice
            activity. Since only a subset of the RTP packets generated by a
            sender are forwarded to the receivers, a video switching MCU can
            break ECN negotiation (the success of the ECN negotiation may
            depend on the voice activity of the participant at the instant the
            negotiation takes place - shout if you want ECN). It also breaks
            congestion feedback and response, since RTP packets are dropped by
            the MCU depending on voice activity rather than network
            congestion. This topology is widely used in legacy products, but
            is NOT RECOMMENDED for new implementations and cannot be used with
            ECN.
</dd>
<dt>Topo-RTCP-terminating-MCU:</dt>
<dd>In this scenario, each
            participant runs an RTP point-to-point session between itself and
            the MCU. Each of these sessions is treated independently for the
            purposes of ECN and RTCP feedback, potentially with some using ECN
            and some not.
</dd>
<dt>Topo-Asymmetric:</dt>
<dd>It is theoretically possible to
            build a middlebox that is a combination of an RTP mixer in one
            direction and an RTP translator in the other. To quote RFC 5117
            "This topology is so problematic and it is so easy to get the RTCP
            processing wrong, that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to implement this
            topology."
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p> These topologies may be combined within a single RTP
        session.
</p>
<p>The ECN mechanism defined in this memo is applicable to both sender
        and receiver controlled congestion algorithms. The mechanism ensures
        that both senders and receivers will know about ECN-CE markings and
        any packet losses. Thus the actual decision point for the congestion
        control is not relevant. This is a great benefit as RTP session can be
        adapted in a number of ways, such as media sender using TFRC <a class='info' href='#RFC5348'>[RFC5348]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Handley, M., Padhye, J., and J. Widmer, &ldquo;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> or other algorithms, or for multicast
        sessions either a sender based scheme with lowest common rate, or
        receiver driven mechanism based on layers to support more
        heterogeneous paths.
</p>
<p>To ensure timely feedback of CE marked packets, this mechanism
        requires support for the RTP/AVPF profile <a class='info' href='#RFC4585'>[RFC4585]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ott, J., Wenger, S., Sato, N., Burmeister, C., and J. Rey, &ldquo;Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> or any of its derivatives, such as RTP/SAVPF
        <a class='info' href='#RFC5124'>[RFC5124]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ott, J. and E. Carrara, &ldquo;Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. The standard RTP/AVP profile <a class='info' href='#RFC3551'>[RFC3551]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and S. Casner, &ldquo;RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> does not allow any early or immediate
        transmission of RTCP feedback, and has a minimal RTCP interval whose
        default value (5 seconds) is many times the normal RTT between sender
        and receiver.
</p>
<p>The control of which RTP data packets are marked as ECT, and
        whether ECT(0) or ECT(1) is used, is due to the sender. RTCP packets
        must not be ECT marked, whether generated by sender or receivers.

Use of ECN with RTP/UDP/IP</h3>

<p>The solution for using ECN with RTP over UDP/IP consists of four
      different pieces that together makes the solution work:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Negotiation of the capability to use ECN with RTP/UDP
</li>
<li>Initiation and initial verification of ECN capable transport
</li>
<li>Ongoing use of ECN within an RTP session
</li>
<li>Failure detection, verification and fallback
</li>
</ol><p> Before an RTP session can be created, a signalling protocol is
      used to discover the other participants and negotiate session parameters
      (see <a class='info' href='#sec-signalling'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Negotiation of ECN Capability</span><span>)</span></a>). One of the parameters that
      can be negotiated is the capability of a participant to support ECN
      functionality, or otherwise. Note that all participants having the
      capability of supporting ECN does not necessarily imply that ECN is
      usable in an RTP session, since there may be middleboxes on the path
      between the participants which don't support ECN (for example, a
      firewall that blocks traffic with the ECN bits set). This document
      defines the information that needs to be negotiated, and provides a
      mapping to SDP for use in both declarative and offer/answer
      contexts.
</p>
<p>When a sender joins a session for which all participants claim ECN
      capability, it must verify if that capability is usable. There are three
      ways in which this verification phase may be done (<a class='info' href='#sec-initiation'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Initiation of ECN Use in an RTP Session</span><span>)</span></a>): </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The sender may generate a (small) subset of its RTP data packets
          with the ECN field set to ECT(0) or ECT(1). Each receiver will then
          send an RTCP feedback packet indicating the reception of the ECT
          marked RTP packets. Upon reception of this feedback from each
          receiver it knows of, the sender can consider ECN functional for its
          traffic. Each sender does this verification independently of each
          other. If a new receiver joins an existing session it also needs to
          verify ECN support. If verification fails the sender needs to stop
          using ECN. As the sender will not know of the receiver prior to it
          sending RTP or RTCP packets, the sender will wait for the first RTCP
          packet from the new receiver to determine if that contains ECN
          feedback or not.
</li>
<li>Alternatively, ECN support can be verified during an initial
          end-to-end STUN exchange (for example, as part of ICE connection
          establishment). After having verified connectivity without ECN
          capability an extra STUN exchange, this time with the ECN field set
          to ECT(0) or ECT(1), is performed. If successful the path's
          capability to convey ECN marked packets is verified. A new STUN
          attribute is defined to convey feedback that the ECT marked request
          was received.
</li>
<li>Thirdly, make a leap of faith that it will work. This is only
          recommended in applications that know they run in controlled
          environments where ECN functionality through other means have been
          verified. In this mode one assumes ECN to work and then reacts to
          failure indicators if the assumption proved wrong. The usage of this
          method relies on a high confidence in successful ECN function or an
          application where failure are not serious. However, also the impact
          on the network and other users must be considered. Thus there are
          limitation to when this method is allowed.
</li>
</ul><p> The first mechanism, using RTP with RTCP feedback, has the
      advantage of working for all RTP sessions, but the disadvantages of
      potential clipping if ECN marked RTP packets are discarded by
      middleboxes, and slow verification of ECN support. The STUN-based
      mechanism is faster to verify ECN support, but only works in those
      scenarios supported by end-to-end STUN, such as within an ICE exchange.
      The third one, leap-of-faith, has the advantage of avoiding additional
      tests or complexities and enabling ECN usage from the first media
      packet. The downside is that if the end-to-end path contains middleboxes
      that do not pass ECN, the impact on the application can be severe: in
      the worst case, all media could be lost if a middlebox that discards ECN
      marked packets is present. A less severe effect, but still requiring
      reaction, is the presence of a middlebox that remarks ECT marked packets
      to non-ECT, possibly marking packets with a CE mark as non-ECT. This can
      force the network into heavy congestion due to non-responsiveness, and
      seriously impact media quality.
</p>
<p>Once ECN support has been verified (or assumed) to work for all
      receivers, a sender marks all its RTP packets as ECT packets, while
      receivers rapidly feedback any CE marks to the sender using RTCP in
      RTP/AVPF immediate or early feedback mode (see <a class='info' href='#sec-ongoing'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ongoing Use of ECN Within an RTP Session</span><span>)</span></a>). An RTCP feedback report is sent as soon
      as possible by the transmission rules for feedback that are in place.
      This feedback report indicates new CE marks since last ECN feedback
      packet and also the number of new CE marks through a accumulative sum.
      This is the mechanism to provide the fastest possible feedback to
      senders about CE marks. On receipt of a CE marked packet, the system
      must react to congestion as-if packet loss has been reported.
</p>
<p>This rapid feedback is not optimised for reliability, therefore an
      additional procedure is used to ensure more reliable, but less timely,
      reporting of the ECN information. An ECN summary report should also be
      sent in regular RTCP reports. The ECN summary report contains the same
      information as the ECN feedback format, only packed differently for
      better efficiency with large reports. By using accumulative counters for
      seen CE, ECT, not-ECT or packet loss the sender can determine what
      events has happened since the last report, independently of any RTCP
      packets having been lost.
</p>
<p>RTCP traffic must not be ECT marked for the following reason. ECT
      marked traffic may be dropped if the path is not ECN compliant. As RTCP
      is used to provide feedback about what has been transmitted and what ECN
      markings that are received it is important that these are received in
      cases when ECT marked traffic is not getting through.
</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons why the path the RTP packets take from the
      sender to the receiver may change, e.g. mobility, link failure followed
      by re-routing around it. Such an event may result in the packet being
      sent through a node that is ECN non-compliant, thus remarking or
      dropping packets with ECT set. To prevent this from impacting the
      application for longer than necessary, the operation of ECN is
      constantly monitored by all senders. Both the RTCP ECN summary reports
      and the ECN feedback packets allow the sender to compare the number of
      ECT(0), ECT(1), and non-ECT marked packet with those that were sent,
      while also reporting CE marked and lost packets. If these numbers do not
      agree with what was sent, it can be inferred that the path does not
      reliably pass ECN-marked packets. More detailed discussions are
      presented in <a class='info' href='#sec-ecn-failure'>Section&nbsp;4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Detecting Failures and Receiver Misbehaviour</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#sec-interpret'>Section&nbsp;4.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Interpretation of ECN Summary information</span><span>)</span></a> on how to interpret different cases. A
      sender detecting a possible ECN non-compliance issue should then stop
      sending ECT marked packets to determine if that allows the packet to be
      correctly delivered. If the issues can be connected to ECN, then ECN
      usage is suspended and possibly also re-negotiated.
</p>
<p>This specification offers an option of computing and reporting an ECN
      nonce over all received packets that where not ECN-CE marked or reported
      explicitly lost. Thus, the sender will have an additional tool to detect
      if any remarking happens. It can also based on statistics detect
      receivers that suppress reporting of CE marked packets, i.e. detect
      cheating. The incentive for a real-time application to cheat in its ECN
      reporting is less than for TCP, as increased congestion levels are
      likely to cause packet losses that decrease the media quality. While for
      TCP lying allows for keeping a larger congestion window than compliant
      receivers and any packet losses will be corrected by TCP's
      retransmission. The ECN nonce mechanism also requires more data to
      function correctly. To enable the sender to verify the ECN nonce, the
      sender must learn the sequence number of all packets that was either CE
      marked or lost. Otherwise it can't correctly exclude these packet from
      the ECN nonce sum. This is done using a RTCP XR Nonce report, containing
      the nonce sums and indicating the lost or ECN-CE marked packets using a
      run length encoded bit-vector. Thus ECN nonce has a higher demand for
      RTCP bandwidth. Combined with the reduced incentive to cheat, this
      mechanism is optional and is only recommended for applications where the
      incentive might be higher, such as streaming with retransmissions.
</p>
<p>In the detailed specification of the behaviour below, the different
      functions the general case will first be discussed. In cases special
      considerations are needed for middleboxes, multicast usage etc, those
      will be specially discussed in related subsections.

Negotiation of ECN Capability</h3>

<p>The first stage of ECN negotiation for RTP-over-UDP is to signal
        the capability to use ECN. This includes negotiating if ECN is to be
        used symmetrically, the method for initial ECT verification, and
        whether the ECN nonce is to be used. This memo defines the mappings of
        this information onto SDP both for declarative and offer/answer usage.
        There are one SDP extension to indicate if ECN support should be used
        and the method for initiation. In addition there are an ICE parameter
        to indicate that ECN initiation using STUN as part of an ICE exchange
        is supported.
</p>
<p>An RTP system that supports ECN and uses SDP in the signalling MUST
        implement the SDP extension to signal ECN capability as described in
        <a class='info' href='#sec-sdp-ecn'>Section&nbsp;4.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Signalling ECN Capability using SDP</span><span>)</span></a>. It MAY also implement alternative

Signalling ECN Capability using SDP</h3>

<p>One new SDP attribute, "a=ecn-capable-rtp", is defined. This is a
          media level attribute, which MUST NOT be used at the session level.
          It is not subject to the character set chosen. The aim of this
          signalling is to indicate the capability of the sender and receivers
          to support ECN, and to negotiate the method for ECN initiation to be
          used in the session. Thus the attribute take a list of methods for
          initiation, which are ordered in decreasing preference. The defined
          values for the initiation method are:

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>In addition, a number of OPTIONAL parameters may be included in
          the "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The "mode" parameter signals the endpoint's capability to set
              and read ECN marks in UDP packets. An examination of various
              operating systems has shown that end-system support for ECN
              marking of UDP packets may be symmetric or asymmetric. By this
              we mean that some systems may allow end points to set the ECN
              bits in an outgoing UDP packet but not read them, while others
              may allow applications to read the ECN bits but not set them.
              This either/or case may produce an asymmetric support for ECN
              and thus should be conveyed in the SDP signalling. The
              "mode=setread" state is the ideal condition where an endpoint
              can both set and read ECN bits in UDP packets. The
              "mode=setonly" state indicates that an endpoint can set the ECT
              bit, but cannot read the ECN bits from received UDP packets to
              determine if upstream congestion occurred. The "mode=readonly"
              state indicates that the endpoint can read the ECN bits to
              determine if downstream congestion has occurred, but it cannot
              set the ECT bits in outgoing UDP packets. When the "mode="
              parameter is omitted it is assumed that the node has "setread"
              capabilities. This option can provide for an early indication
              that ECN cannot be used in a session. This would be case when
              both the offerer and answerer set the "mode=" parameter to
              "setonly" or "readonly", or when an RTP sender entity considers
              offering "readonly".
</li>
<li>The "nonce" parameter may be used to signal whether the ECN
              nonce is to be used in the session. This parameter takes two
              values; "nonce=1" for nonce proposed or shall be used, and
              "nonce=0" for no nonce.
</li>
<li>The "ect" parameter makes it possible to express the
              preferred ECT marking. This is either random (default), ECT(0)
              or ECT(1). If the ECN nonce is used then this parameter MUST be
              ignored, and random ECT is implied. The "ect" parameter
              describes a receiver preference, and is useful in the case where
              the receiver knows it is behind a link using IP header
              compression, the efficiency of which would be seriously
              disrupted if it were to receive packets with randomly chosen ECT
              marks.

<p>When SDP is used with the offer/answer model <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the party generating the SDP offer MUST
          insert an "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute into the media section of
          the SDP offer of each RTP flow for which it wishes to use ECN. The
          attribute includes one or more ECN initiation methods in a comma
          separated list in decreasing order of preference, with some number
          of optional parameters following. The answering party compares the
          list of initiation methods in the offer with those it supports in
          order of preference. If there is a match, and if the receiver wishes
          to attempt to use ECN in the session, it includes an
          "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute containing its single preferred choice
          of initiation method in the media sections of the answer. If there
          is no matching initiation method capability, or if the receiver does
          not wish to attempt to use ECN in the session, it does not include
          an "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute in its answer. If the attribute is
          removed then ECN MUST NOT be used in any direction for that media
          flow. The answer may also include optional parameters, as discussed
          below.
</p>
<p>If the "mode=setonly" parameter is present in the
          "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute of the offer and the answering party
          is also "mode=setonly", then there is no common ECN capability, and
          the answer MUST NOT include the "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute.
          Otherwise, if the offer is "mode=setonly" then ECN may only be
          initiated in the direction from the offering party to the answering
          party.
</p>
<p>If the "mode=readonly" parameter is present in the
          "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute of the offer and the answering party
          is "mode=readonly", then there is no common ECN capability, and the
          answer MUST NOT include the "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute.
          Otherwise, if the offer is "mode=readonly" then ECN may only be
          initiated in the direction from the answering party to the offering
          party.
</p>
<p>If the "mode=setread" parameter is present in the
          "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute of the offer and the answering party
          is "setonly", then ECN may only be initiated in the direction from
          the answering party to the offering party. If the offering party is
          "mode=setread" but the answering party is "mode=readonly", then ECN
          may only be initiated in the direction from the offering party to
          the answering party. If both offer and answer are "mode=setread",
          then ECN may be initiated in both directions. Note that
          "mode=setread" is implied by the absence of a "mode=" parameter in
          the offer.
</p>
<p>If the "nonce=1" parameter is present in the "a=ecn-capable-rtp"
          attribute of the offer, the answer MUST explicitly include the
          "nonce=" parameter in the "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute of the
          answer to indicate if it supports the ECN nonce. If the answer
          indicates support ("nonce=1") then ECN nonce SHALL be used in the
          session; if the answer does not include the "nonce=" parameter, or
          includes "nonce=0", then the ECN nonce SHALL NOT be used. The answer
          MAY include a "nonce=0" parameter in an answer even if not included
          in the offer. This indicates that the answerer supports and is
          interested in using ECN-nonce in this session, but it is not
          currently enabled. If the offerer supports use of the nonce then it
          SHOULD run a second round of offer/answer to enable use of the ECN
          nonce.
</p>
<p>The "ect=" parameter in the "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute is set
          independently in the offer and the answer. Its value in the offer
          indicates a preference for the behaviour of the answering party, and
          its value in the answer indicates a preference for the behaviour of
          the offering party. It will be the senders choice if to honor the
          receivers preference or not.
</p>
<p>When SDP is used in a declarative manner, for example in a
          multicast session using SAP, negotiation of session description
          parameters is not possible. The "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute MAY be
          added to the session description to indicate that the sender will
          use ECN in the RTP session. The attribute MUST include a single
          method of initiation. Participants MUST NOT join such a session
          unless they have the capability to understand ECN-marked UDP
          packets, implement the method of initiation, and can generate RTCP
          ECN feedback (note that having the capability to use ECN doesn't
          necessarily imply that the underlying network path between sender
          and receiver supports ECN). If the nonce parameter is included the
          ECN nonce shall be used in the session. The mode parameter MAY be
          included also in declarative usage, to indicate which capability is
          required by the consumer of the SDP. So for example in a SSM session
          the participants configured with a particular SDP will all be in a
          media receive only mode, thus mode=readonly will work as the
          capability of reporting on the ECN markings in the received is what
          is required.
</p>
<p>The "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute MAY be used with RTP media
          sessions using UDP/IP transport. It MUST NOT be used for RTP
          sessions using TCP, SCTP, or DCCP transport, or for non-RTP
          sessions.
</p>
<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#sec-congestion'>Section&nbsp;4.3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Response to Congestion Notifications</span><span>)</span></a>, RTP
          sessions using ECN require rapid RTCP ECN feedback, in order that
          the sender can react to ECN-CE marked packets. Thus, the use of the
          Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF) <a class='info' href='#RFC4585'>[RFC4585]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ott, J., Wenger, S., Sato, N., Burmeister, C., and J. Rey, &ldquo;Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> MUST be signalled.
</p>
<p>When using ECN nonce, the RTCP XR signalling indicating the ECN
          Nonce report MUST also be included in the SDP following <a class='info' href='#RFC3611'>[RFC3611]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Friedman, T., Caceres, R., and A. Clark, &ldquo;RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Initiation of ECN Use in an RTP Session</h3>

<p>Once the sender and the receiver(s) have agreed that they have the
        capability to use ECN within a session, they may attempt to initiate
        ECN use.
</p>
<p>At the start of the RTP session when the first packets with ECT are
        sent it is important to verify that IP packets with ECN field values
        of ECT or ECN-CE will reach its destination(s). There is some risk
        that the usage of ECN will result in either reset of the ECN field or
        loss of all packets with ECT or ECN-CE markings. If the path between
        the sender and the receiver exhibits either of these behaviours one
        needs to stop using ECN immediately to protect both the network and
        the application.
</p>
<p>The RTP senders and receivers SHALL NOT ECT mark their RTCP traffic
        during both the initiation and full usage of ECN with RTP. This is to
        ensure that packet loss due to ECN marking will not effect the RTCP
        traffic and the necessary feedback information.
</p>
<p>An RTP system that supports ECN MUST implement the initiation of
        ECN using RTP and RTCP described in <a class='info' href='#sec-rtp-init-ecn'>Section&nbsp;4.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Detection of ECT using RTP and RTCP</span><span>)</span></a>. It MAY also implement other
        mechanisms to initiate ECN support, for example the STUN-based
        mechanism described in <a class='info' href='#sec-stun-init-ecn'>Section&nbsp;4.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Detection of ECT using STUN with ICE</span><span>)</span></a> or use
        the leap of faith option if the session supports the limitations
        provided in <a class='info' href='#sec-leap-init-ecn'>Section&nbsp;4.2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Leap of Faith ECT initiation method</span><span>)</span></a>. If support for
        both mechanisms is signalled, the sender should try ECN negotiation
        using STUN with ICE first, and if it fails, fallback to negotiation
        using RTP and RTCP ECN feedback.
</p>
<p>No matter how ECN usage is initiated, the sender MUST continually
        monitor the ability of the network, and all receivers, to support ECN,
        following the mechanisms described in <a class='info' href='#sec-ecn-failure'>Section&nbsp;4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Detecting Failures and Receiver Misbehaviour</span><span>)</span></a>. This is necessary because path
        changes or changes in the receiver population may invalidate the

Detection of ECT using RTP and RTCP</h3>

<p>The ECN initiation phase using RTP and RTCP to detect if the
          network path supports ECN comprises three stages. Firstly, the RTP
          sender generates some fraction of its traffic with ECT marks to act
          a probe for ECN support. Then, on receipt of these ECT-marked
          packets, the receivers send RTCP ECN feedback packets and RTCP ECN
          summary reports to inform the sender that their path supports ECN.
          Finally, the RTP sender makes the decision to use ECN or not, based
          on whether the paths to all RTP receivers have been verified to
          support ECN.

              its RTP traffic as ECT, while leaving the reminder of the
              packets unmarked. The main reason for only marking some packets
              is to maintain usable media delivery during the ECN initiation
              phase in those cases where ECN is not supported by the network
              path. A secondary reason to send some not-ECT packets are to
              ensure that the receivers will send RTCP reports on this sender,
              even if all ECT marked packets are lost in transit. The not-ECT
              packets also provide a base-line to compare performance
              parameters against. An RTP sender is RECOMMENDED to send a
              minimum of two packets with ECT markings per RTCP reporting
              interval, one with ECT(0) and one with ECT(1), and will continue
              to send some ECT marked traffic as long as the ECN initiation
              phase continues. The sender SHOULD NOT mark all RTP packets as
              ECT during the ECN initiation phase.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>This memo does not mandate which RTP packets are marked with
              ECT during the ECN initiation phase. An implementation should
              insert ECT marks in RTP packets in a way that minimises the
              impact on media quality if those packets are lost. The choice of
              packets to mark is clearly very media dependent, but the usage
              of RTP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-no-op'>NO-OP
              payloads<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andreasen, F., &ldquo;A No-Op Payload Format for RTP,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;avt&#8209;rtp&#8209;no&#8209;op], if supported, would be an appropriate choice.
              For audio formats, if would make sense for the sender to mark
              comfort noise packets or similar. For video formats, packets
              containing P- or B-frames, rather than I-frames, would be an
              appropriate choice. No matter which RTP packets are marked,
              those packets MUST NOT be duplicated in transmission, since
              their RTP sequence number is used to identify packets that are
              received with ECN markings.

<dt>Generating RTCP ECN Feedback:</dt>
<dd>If ECN capability
              has been negotiated in an RTP session, the participants in the
              session MUST listen for ECT or ECN-CE marked RTP packets, and
              generate RTCP ECN feedback packets (<a class='info' href='#sec-rtcp-ecn'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP Extensions for ECN feedback</span><span>)</span></a>) to mark their receipt. An
              immediate or early (depending on the RTP/AVPF mode) ECN feedback
              packet SHOULD be generated on receipt of the first ECT or ECN-CE
              marked packet from a sender that has not previously sent any ECT
              traffic. Each regular RTCP report MUST contain an ECN summary
              report (<a class='info' href='#sec-ecn-summary-report'>Section&nbsp;5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP XR Report block for ECN summary information</span><span>)</span></a>).
              Reception of any ECN-CE marked packets SHOULD also result in
              additional early or immediate feedback packet with the ECN
              feedback packet.
</dd>
<dt>Determination of ECN Support:</dt>
<dd>RTP is a group
              communication protocol, where members can join and leave the
              group at any time. This complicates the ECN initiation phase,
              since the sender must wait until it believes the group
              membership has stabilised before it can determine if the paths
              to all receivers support ECN (group membership changes after the
              ECN initiation phase has completed are discussed in <a class='info' href='#sec-ongoing'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ongoing Use of ECN Within an RTP Session</span><span>)</span></a>).
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>An RTP sender shall consider the group membership to be
              stable after it has been in the session and sending ECT-marked
              probe packets for at least three RTCP reporting intervals (i.e.
              after sending its third regularly scheduled RTCP packet), and
              when a complete RTCP reporting interval has passed without
              changes to the group membership. ECN initiation is considered
              successful when the group membership becomes stable, provided
              all known participants have sent one or more RTCP ECN feedback
              packets indicating correct receipt of the ECT-marked RTP packets
              generated by the sender.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>As an optimisation, if an RTP sender is initiating ECN usage
              towards a unicast address, then it MAY treat the ECN initiation
              as provisionally successful if it receives a single RTCP ECN
              feedback report indicating successful receipt of the ECT-marked
              packets, with no negative indications, from a single RTP
              receiver. After declaring provisional success, the sender MAY
              generate ECT-marked packets as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-ongoing'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ongoing Use of ECN Within an RTP Session</span><span>)</span></a>, provided it continues to monitor
              the RTCP reports for a period of three RTCP reporting intervals
              from the time the ECN initiation started, to check if there is
              any other participants in the session. If other participants are
              detected, the sender MUST fallback to only ECT-marking a small
              fraction of its RTP packets, while it determines if ECN can be
              supported following the full procedure described above. 
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Note: One use case that requires further consideration is
                  a unicast connection with several SSRCs multiplexed onto the

                  layers). It is desirable to be able to rapidly negotiate ECN
                  support for such a session, but the optimisation above fails
                  since the multiple SSRCs make it appear that this is a group
                  communication scenario. It's not sufficient to check that
                  all SSRCs map to a common RTCP CNAME to check if they're
                  actually located on the same device, because there are

Detection of ECT using STUN with ICE</h3>

<p>This section describes an OPTIONAL method that can be used to
          avoid media impact and also ensure ECN capable path prior to media
          transmission. This method is considered in the context where the
          session participants are using <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>ICE<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice] to find working
          connectivity. We need to use ICE rather than STUN only, as the
          verification needs to happen from the media sender to the address
          and port on which the receiver is listening.
</p>
<p>To minimise the impact of set-up delay, and to prioritise the
          fact that one has a working connectivity rather than necessarily
          finding the best ECN capable network path, this procedure is applied
          after having performed a successful connectivity check for a
          candidate, which is nominated for usage. At that point, and provided
          the chosen candidate is not a relayed address, one performs an
          additional connectivity check including the here defined STUN
          attribute "ECT Check" and in an IP/UDP packet that are ECT marked.
          The STUN server will upon reception of the packet note the received
          ECN field value and in its response send an IP/UDP/STUN Packet with
          ECN field set to not-ECT and also include the ECN check STUN
          attribute.
</p>
<p>The STUN ECN check STUN attribute contains one field and a flag.
          The flag indicate if the echo field contains a valid value or not.
          The field is the ECN echo field, and when valid contains the two ECN
          bits from the packet it echoes back. The ECN check STUN attribute is
          an comprehension optional attribute.

Leap of Faith ECT initiation method</h3>

<p>This method for initiating ECN usage is a leap of faith that
          assumes that ECN will work on the used path(s). It is not generally
          recommended as the impact on both the application and the network
          may be substantial. Applications may experience high packet loss
          rates, this is both from dropped ECT marked packets, and the result
          of driving the network into higher degrees of congestion by not
          being responsive to ECN marks. The network may experience higher
          degrees of congestion due to the unresponsiveness of the sender due
          to lost ECN-CE marks from non-compliant remarking.
</p>
<p>The method is to go directly to "ongoing use of ECN" as defined
          in <a class='info' href='#sec-ongoing'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ongoing Use of ECN Within an RTP Session</span><span>)</span></a>. Thus all RTP packets MAY be
          marked as ECT and the failure detection MUST be used to detect any
          case when the assumption that the path was ECT capable is wrong.
</p>
<p>Not sending any RTP packets as not-ECT in the case of
          non-compliant node dropping ECT marked traffic the RTP receiver will
          not get any baseline packets to ensure that it treat this SSRC as an
          active sender. Thus the failure to include the sender in its RTCP
          sender or receiver packets report block becomes the indicator for
          this case. This is blunter than a receiver report block that
          indicates explicitly how many packets actually has been lost. The
          sender should be aware that in unicast or under AVPF transmission
          rules the first RTCP packet may come immediately upon joining or
          already after 500 ms. Thus, triggering on reports without any report
          blocks, cannot be done reliably on the first RTCP report received
          from a new SSRC. Thus delaying detection of lack of functionality
          substantially until a second report comes in.
</p>
<p>This method is only recommended for controlled environments where
          the whole path(s) between sender and receiver(s) has been built and
          verified to be ECT.

Transmission of ECT-marked RTP Packets</h3>

<p>After a sender has successfully initiated ECN usage, it SHOULD
          mark all the RTP data packets it sends as ECT. The choice between
          ECT(0) and ECT(1) is determined by the sender having considered the

          "a=ecn-capable-rtp" attribute. If the sender selects a random choice
          of ECT marking, the sender MUST record the statistics for the
          different ECN values sent. If ECN nonce is activated the sender must
          record the value and calculate the ECN-nonce sum for outgoing

Reporting ECN Feedback via RTCP</h3>

<p>An RTP receiver that receives a packet with an ECN-CE mark, or
          that detects a packet loss, MUST schedule the transmission of an
          RTCP ECN feedback packet as soon as possible to report this back to
          the sender. The feedback RTCP packet sent SHALL consist at least one
          ECN feedback packet (<a class='info' href='#sec-rtcp-ecn'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP Extensions for ECN feedback</span><span>)</span></a>) reporting
          on the packets received since the last ECN feedback packet, and
          SHOULD contain an RTCP SR or RR packet. The RTP/AVPF profile in
          early or immediate feedback mode SHOULD be used where possible, to
          reduce the interval before feedback can be sent. To reduce the size
          of the feedback message, reduced size RTCP <a class='info' href='#RFC5506'>[RFC5506]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johansson, I. and M. Westerlund, &ldquo;Support for Reduced-Size Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP): Opportunities and Consequences,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> MAY be used if supported by the end-points.
          Both RTP/AVPF and reduced size RTCP MUST be negotiated in the
          session set-up signalling before they can be used. ECN Nonce
          information SHOULD NOT be included in early or immediate reports,
          only when regular reports are sent.
</p>
<p>Every time a regular compound RTCP packet is to be transmitted,
          the RTP receiver MUST include an RTCP XR ECN summary report <a class='info' href='#sec-ecn-summary-report'>Section&nbsp;5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP XR Report block for ECN summary information</span><span>)</span></a> as part of the compound
          packet. If ECN-nonce is enabled the receiver MUST also include an
          RTCP XR Nonce report packet <a class='info' href='#sec-rtcp-xr-ce'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP XR Report Block for ECN Nonce</span><span>)</span></a>.
          It is important to configure the RTCP bandwidth (e.g. using an SDP
          "b=" line) such that the bit-rate is sufficient for a usage that
          includes ECN-CE events.
</p>
<p>The multicast feedback implosion problem, that occurs when many
          receivers simultaneously send feedback to a single sender, must also
          be considered. The RTP/AVPF transmission rules will limit the amount
          of feedback that can be sent, avoiding the implosion problem but
          also delaying feedback by varying degrees from nothing up to a full
          RTCP reporting interval. As a result, the full extent of a
          congestion situation may take some time to reach the sender,
          although some feedback should arrive reasonably timely, allowing the
          sender to react on a single or a few reports. </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>An open issue is whether we should employ some form of
              feedback suppression on ECN-CE feedback for groups? If one can
              make an assumption that a sender will react on a few ECN-CE
              marks then suppression could be employed successfully and reduce
              the RTCP bandwidth usage.

<p>In case a receiver driven congestion control algorithm is to be
          used and has through signalling been agreed upon, the algorithm MAY
          specify that the immediate scheduling (and later transmission) of
          ECN-CE feedback of any received ECN-CE mark is not required and
          shall not be done. In that case ECN feedback is only sent using
          regular RTCP reports for verification purpose and in response to the
          initiation process ("rtp") of any new media senders as specified in

ECN Nonce Reporting</h3>

<p>ECN Nonce reporting requires both the ECN nonce sum and the
            sequence numbers for packets where the ECN marking has been lost.
            This information is variable size as it depends on both the total
            number of packet sent per reporting interval and the CE and Packet
            loss pattern how many bits are required for reporting.
</p>
<p>The RTCP packets may be lost, and to avoid the possibility for
            cheating by "losing" the Nonce information for where one is
            cheating the nonce coverage needs to be basically complete. Thus
            the Nonce reporting SHOULD cover at least the 3 regular reporting
            intervals. The only exception allowed is if the reporting
            information becomes to heavy and makes the RTCP report packet
            become larger than the MTU. In that case a receiver MAY reduced to
            coverage for the ECN nonce to only the last or two last reporting
            intervals. A sender should consider the received size report for
            cases where the coverage is not at least three reporting intervals
            and determine if this may be done to cheat or not. Failure to have
            reported on all intervals MAY be punished by reducing the
            congestion safe rate.
</p>
<p>The ECN nonce information in the ECN feedback packet consists
            of both a start value for the nonce prior to the first packet in
            the reporting interval and the final 2-bit XOR sum over all the
            received ECN values, both not-ECT and ECT for the report interval.
            The report interval is explicitly signalled in the RTCP XR Nonce
            report packet. The initial value for the Nonce is 00b.

Response to Congestion Notifications</h3>

<p>When RTP packets are received with ECN-CE marks, the sender
          and/or receivers MUST react with congestion control as-if those
          packets had been lost. Depending on the media format, type of
          session, and RTP topology used, there are several different types of
          congestion control that can be used.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Sender-Driven Congestion Control:</dt>
<dd>The sender may
              be responsible for adapting the transmitted bit-rate in response
              to RTCP ECN feedback. When the sender receives the ECN feedback
              data it feeds this information into its congestion control or
              bit-rate adaptation mechanism so that it can react on it as if
              it was packet losses that was reported. The congestion control
              algorithm to be used is not specified here, although TFRC <a class='info' href='#RFC5348'>[RFC5348]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Handley, M., Padhye, J., and J. Widmer, &ldquo;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> is one example that might be used.
</dd>
<dt>Receiver-Driven Congestion Control:</dt>
<dd>If receiver
              driven congestion control mechanism is used, the receiver can
              react to the ECN-CE marks without contacting the sender. This
              may allow faster response than sender-driven congestion control
              in some circumstances. Receiver-driven congestion control is
              usually implemented by providing the content in a layered way,
              with each layer providing improved media quality but also
              increased bandwidth usage. The receiver locally monitors the
              ECN-CE marks on received packet to check if it experiences
              congestion at the current number of layers. If congestion is
              experienced, the receiver drops one layer, so reducing the
              resource consumption on the path towards itself. For example, if
              a layered media encoding scheme such as H.264 SVC is used, the
              receiver may change its layer subscription, and so reduce the
              bit rate it receives. The receiver MUST still send RTCP ECN
              feedback to the sender, even if it can adapt without contact
              with the sender, so that the sender can determine if ECN is
              supported on the network path. The timeliness of RTCP feedback
              is less of a concern with receiver driven congestion control,
              and regular RTCP reporting of ECN feedback is sufficient
              (without using RTP/AVPF immediate or early feedback).
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Responding to congestion indication in the case of multicast
          traffic is a more complex problem than for unicast traffic. The
          fundamental problem is diverse paths, i.e. when different receivers
          don't see the same path, and thus have different bottlenecks, so the
          receivers may get ECN-CE marked packets due to congestion in
          different points in the network. This is problematic for sender
          driven congestion control, since when receivers are heterogeneous in
          regards to capacity the sender is limited to transmitting at the
          rate the slowest receiver can support. This often becomes a
          significant limitation as group size grows. Also, as group size
          increases the frequency of reports from each receiver decreases,
          which further reduces the responsiveness of the mechanism.
          Receiver-driven congestion control has the advantage that each
          receiver can choose the appropriate rate for its network path,
          rather than all having to settle for the lowest common rate.

<p>We note that ECN support is not a silver bullet to improving
          performance. The use of ECN gives the change to respond to
          congestion before packets are dropped in the network, improving the
          user experience by allowing the RTP application to control how the
          quality is reduced. An application which ignores ECN congestion
          experienced feedback is not immune to congestion: the network will
          eventually begin to discard packets if traffic doesn't respond. It
          is in the best interest of an application to respond to ECN
          congestion feedback promptly, to avoid packet loss.

Detecting Failures and Receiver Misbehaviour</h3>

<p>ECN-nonce is defined in RFC3540 as a means to ensure that a TCP
        clients does not mask ECN-CE marks, this assumes that the sending
        endpoint (server) acts on behalf of the network.
</p>
<p>The assumption about the senders acting on the behalf of the
        network may be reduced due to the nature of peer-to-peer usage. Still
        a large part of RTP senders are infrastructure devices that do have an
        interest in protecting both service quality and the network. In
        addition as real-time media commonly is more sensitive to increased
        delay and packet loss it will be in both media sender and receivers
        interest to minimise the number and duration of any congestion events
        as it will affect media quality.
</p>
<p>In addition ECN with RTP can suffer from path changes resulting in
        that a non ECN compliant node becomes part of the path. That node may
        perform either of two actions that has effect on the ECN and
        application functionality. The gravest is if the node drops packets
        with any ECN field values other than 00b. This can be detected by the
        receiver when it receives a RTCP SR packet indicating that a number of
        packets has not been received. The sender may also detect it based on
        the receivers RTCP RR packet where the extended sequence number is not
        advanced due to the failure to receive packets. If the packet loss is
        less than 100% then packet loss reporting in either the ECN feedback
        information or RTCP RR will indicate the situation. The other action
        is to remark a packet from ECT to not-ECT. That has less dire results,
        however, it should be detected so that ECN usage can be suspended to
        prevent misusing the network.
</p>
<p>The ECN feedback packet allows the sender to compare the number of
        ECT marked packets of different type with the number it actually sent.
        The number of ECT packets received plus the number of CE marked and
        lost packets should correspond to the number of sent ECT marked
        packets. If this number doesn't agree there are two likely reasons, a
        translator changing the stream or not carrying the ECN markings
        forward or that some node remarks the packets. In both cases the usage
        of ECN is broken on the path. By tracking all the different possible
        ECN field values a sender can quickly detect if some non-compliant
        behavior is happing on the path.
</p>
<p>Thus packet losses and non-matching ECN field value statistics are
        possible indication of issues with using ECN over the path. The next
        section defines both sender and receiver reactions to these cases.

Fallback mechanisms</h3>

<p>Upon the detection of a potential failure both the sender and the
          receiver can react to mitigate the situation.
</p>
<p>A Receiver that detects a packet loss burst MAY schedule an early
          feedback packet to report this to the sender that includes at least
          the RTCP RR and the ECN feedback message. Thus speeding up the
          detection at the sender of the losses and thus triggering sender
          side mitigation.
</p>
<p>A Sender that detects high packet loss rates for its RTP packet
          flow while sending them marked as ECT, SHOULD immediately remark
          them as not-ECT to determine if the losses potentially are due to
          the ECT markings. If the losses disappear with the remarking, the
          RTP sender should go back to initiation procedures to attempt to
          verify the apparent loss of ECN capability of the used path. If a
          re-initiation fails then the two possible actions exist:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Periodically retry the ECN initiation to detect if a path
              change occurs to a path that are ECN capable.
</li>
<li>Renegotiating the session to disable ECN support. A choice
              that is suitable if the impact of ECT probing on the media
              quality are noticeable. If multiple initiations has been
              successful but the following full usage of ECN has resulted in
              the fallback procedures then disabling of the ECN support is
              RECOMMENDED.
</li>
</ol><p>We foresee the possibility of flapping ECN capability due
          to several reasons:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Video switching MCU or similar middleboxes that selects to
              deliver media from the sender only intermittently.
</li>
<li>Load balancing devices may in worst case result in that some
              packets take a different network path then the others.
</li>
<li>Mobility solutions that switches underlying network path in a

Interpretation of ECN Summary information</h3>

<p>This section contains discussion on how you can use the ECN
          summary report information in detecting various types of ECN path
          issues. Lets start to review the information the reports provide on
          a per source (SSRC) basis:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>CE Counter:</dt>
<dd>The number of RTP packets received so
              far in the session with an ECN field set to CE (11b).
</dd>
<dt>ECT (0/1) Counters:</dt>
<dd>The number of RTP packets
              received so far in the session with an ECN field set to ECT (0)
              and ECT (1) respectively (10b / 01b).
</dd>
<dt>not-ECT Counter:</dt>
<dd>The number of RTP packets
              received so far in the session with an ECN field set to not-ECT
              (00b)
</dd>
<dt>Packet loss counter:</dt>
<dd>The number of RTP packets
              that are expected minus the number received.
</dd>
<dt>Extended Highest Sequence number:</dt>
<dd>The highest
              sequence number seen when sending this report, but with
              additional bits, to handle disambiguation when wrapping the RTP
              sequence number field.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>The counters will be initiated to zero they provide value
          for the RTP stream sender from the very first report. After the
          first report the changes between the latest received and the
          previous one is determined by simply taking the values of the latest
          minus the previous one, taking field wrapping into account. This
          definition is also robust to packet losses, as if one report is
          missing, the period for which the information is covering becomes
          longer, but otherwise equally valid.
</p>
<p>In a perfect world the number of not-ECT received should be equal
          to the number sent minus some fraction of the lost packets, and the
          sum of the ECT, CE should be equal to the number ECT marked sent
          minus a fraction of the lost packets. There are however two sources
          of uncertainty in this, number of packet losses, and packet
          duplication. Packet loss and packet duplication can change the
          distribution between ECT(0), ECT(1) and not-ECT. This by having for
          example a ECT (0) packet being lost, and then a ECT(1) packet being
          duplicated and counted as two, thus making the ECT(1) counter become
          one bigger and the ECT(0) one less than expected. To avoid these
          issues it is recommended that suppression of duplicate packets are
          performed before gathering this statistics.
</p>
<p>The level of packet duplication included in the report can be
          estimated from the sum over all of fields counting received packets.
          A high level of packet duplication increases the insecurity in the
          statistics and firm conclusions becomes more difficult and requires
          clearer statics.

<dd>If the ratio
              between ECT and not-ECT transmitted in the reports has become

              transmitted) between ECT and not-ECT is significantly different.

Using ECN-nonce</h3>

<p>This document offers ECN Nonce as a method of strengthening both
          the detection of failures and enable senders to verify the receiver
          behavior. We note that it appears quite counter productive for a
          receiver to attempt to cheat as it most likely will have negative
          impact on its media quality. However, certain usages of RTP may
          result in a situation that is more similar to TCP, i.e. where packet
          losses are repaired and a higher bit-rate is desirable. Thus RTP
          sessions that use repair mechanisms as FEC or retransmission may
          consider the usage of the ECN nonce to prevent cheating.

<p>This AVPF NACK feedback format is intended for usage in AVPF early
        or immediate feedback modes when information needs to urgently reach
        the sender. Thus its main usage is upon reception of a ECN-CE marked

In reduced size RTCP feedback packets may be

</dl></blockquote><p>Each FCI reports on a single source. Multiple sources can be
        reported by including multiple RTCP feedback messages in an compound
        RTCP packet. The AVPF common header indicates both the sender of the
        feedback message and on which stream it relates to.
</p>
<p>The Counters SHALL be initiated to 0 for a new receiver. This to
        enable detection of CE or Packet loss already on the initial report
        from a specific participant.
</p>
<p>The Extended Highest sequence number and packet loss fields are
        both truncated in comparison to the RTCP SR or RR versions. This is to
        save bits as the representation is redundant unless reduced size RTCP
        is used in such a way that only feedback packets are transmitted, with
        no SR or RR in the compound RTCP packet. Due to that regular RTCP
        reporting will include the longer versions of the fields the wrapping
        issue will be less unless the packet rate of the application is so
        high that the fields will wrap within a regular RTCP reporting
        interval. In those case the feedback packet need to be sent in a
        compound packet together with the SR or RR packet.
</p>
<p>There is an issue with packet duplication in relation to the packet
        loss counter. If one avoids holding state for which sequence number
        has been received then the way one can count loss is to count the
        number of received packets and compare that to the number of packets
        expected. As a result a packet duplication can hide a packet loss. If
        a receiver is tracking the sequence numbers actually received and
        suppresses duplicates it provides for a more reliable packet loss
        indication. Reordering may also result in that packet loss is reported
        in one report and then removed in the next.
</p>
<p>The CE counter is actually more robust for packet duplication.
        Adding each received CE marked packet to the counter is not an issue.
        If one of the clones was CE marked that is still a indication of
        congestion. Packet duplication has potential impact on the ECN
        verification. Thus the sum of packets reported may be higher than the
        number sent. However, most detections are still applicable.

<p>The Extended Highest Sequence number and the packet loss counter
        for each SSRC is not present in RTCP XR report, in contrast to the
        feedback version. The reason is that this summary report will always
        be sent in a RTCP compound packet where the Extended Highest Sequence
        number and the accumulated number of packet losses are present in the
        RTCP Sender Report or Receiver Report packet's report block.

RTCP XR Report Block for ECN Nonce</h3>

<p>This RTCP XR block is for ECN Nonce reporting. It consists of an
        initial part that contains the ECN nonce XOR sum followed by an Run
        length encoded (RLE) bitvector that indicate which RTP sequence
        numbers that wasn't included in the ECN nonce sum due to having been
        lost or ECN CE marked. The bit-vector uses 1 to indicate that the
        packet wasn't included in the ECN nonce sum and 0 for packets that
        where.
</p>
<p>The bit-vector is expressed using either Run-Length Encoding or
        15-bit explicit bit-vectors. The whole vector is encoded using the
        16-bit chunks as defined by Section 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 in <a class='info' href='#RFC3611'>[RFC3611]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Friedman, T., Caceres, R., and A.

<p>The Nonce sum initial value for a new media sender (new SSRC) SHALL
        be 00b. Otherwise the Initial value is the Nonce value calculated for
        the RTP packet with sequence number begin_seq -1. The initial value
        for the expressed reporting interval is included in the INV field. The
        receiver calculate the 2-bit Nonce XOR sum over all received RTP
        packets in the reporting interval including the one with end_seq
        sequence number. We note that the RTCP participant doing the Nonce sum
        MUST perform suppression of packet duplicates. The nonce sum will
        become incorrect if any duplicates are included in the sum. All
        packets not received or received as ECN-CE marked when constructing
        the ECN Nonce report MUST be explicitly marked in the bitvector.
</p>
<p>The Nonce reporting interval is RECOMMENDED to cover all the RTP
        packets received during the three last regular reporting intervals.
        This is to ensure that the sender will receive a report over all RTP
        packets. Failure to deliver reports that cover all the packets may be
        interpreted as an attempt to cheat. Two additional considerations must
        be made when selecting the reporting interval. First, are the MTU
        considerations. The packet vector and its encoding into chunks results
        in a variable sized report. The size depends on two main factors, the
        number of packets to report on and the frequency of bit-value changes
        in the vector. The reporting interval may need to be shortened to two
        or even one reporting interval if the resulting ECN nonce report
        becomes too big to fit into the RTCP packet.
</p>
<p>Secondly, the RTP sequence number can easily wrap and that needs to
        be considered when they are handed. The report SHALL NOT report on
        more than 32768 consecutive packets. The last sequence number is the
        extended sequence number that is equal too or smaller (less than 65535
        packets) than the value present in the Receiver Reports "extended
        highest sequence number received" field. The "first sequence number"
        value is thus an extended sequence number which is smaller than the
        "last sequence number". If there is a wrap between the first sequence
        number and the last, i.e. First sequence number &gt; Last sequence
        number (seen as 16-bit unsigned integers), then the wrap needs to
        included in the calculation. If an application is having these issues,
        the frequency of regular RTCP reporting should be modified by ensuring
        that the application chooses appropriate settings for the minimum RTCP
        reporting interval parameters.
</p>
<p>Both the ECN-CE and packet loss information is structured as bit
        vectors where the first bit represents the RTP packet with the
        sequence number equal to the First Sequence number. The bit-vector
        will contain values representing all packets up to and including the
        one in the "end_seq" field. The chunk mechanism used to represent the
        bit-vector in an efficient way may appear longer upon reception if an
        explicit bit-vector is used as the last chunk. Bit-values representing
        packets with higher sequence number (modulo 16) than "end_seq" are not
        valid and SHALL be ignored.
</p>
<p>The produced bit-vector is encoded using chunks. The chunks are any
        of the three types defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3611'>[RFC3611]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Friedman, T., Caceres, R., and A. Clark, &ldquo;RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, Run

Processing RTCP ECN Feedback in RTP Translators and Mixers</h3>

Fragmentation and Reassembly in Translators</h3>

<p>An RTP translator may fragment or reassemble RTP data packets
        without changing the media encoding. An example of this might be to
        combine packets of a voice-over-IP stream coded with one 20ms frame
        per RTP packet into new RTP packets with two 20ms frames per packet,
        thereby reducing the header overheads and so stream bandwidth, at the
        expense of an increase in latency. If multiple data packets are
        re-encoded into one, or vice versa, the RTP translator MUST assign new
        sequence numbers to the outgoing packets. Losses in the incoming RTP
        packet stream may induce corresponding gaps in the outgoing RTP
        sequence numbers. An RTP translator MUST also rewrite RTCP packets to

Generating RTCP ECN Feedback in Translators</h3>

<p>An RTP translator that acts as a media transcoder cannot directly
        forward RTCP packets corresponding to the transcoded stream, since
        those packets will relate to the non-transcoded stream, and will not
        be useful in relation to the transcoded RTP flow. Such a transcoder
        will need to interpose itself into the RTCP flow, acting as a proxy
        for the receiver to generate RTCP feedback in the direction of the
        sender relating to the pre-transcoded stream, and acting in place of
        the sender to generate RTCP relating to the transcoded stream, to be
        sent towards the receiver. This section describes how this proxying is
        to be done for RTCP ECN feedback packets. Section 7.2 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V.

Generating RTCP ECN Feedback in Mixers</h3>

<p>An RTP mixer terminates one-or-more RTP flows, combines them into a
        single outgoing media stream, and transmits that new stream as a
        separate RTP flow. An ECN-aware RTP mixer must send RTCP reports and
        provide ECN feedback for the RTP flows it terminates, and must
        generate RTCP reports for the RTP flow it originates, and add ECT
        marks to the outgoing packets. This section describes how RTCP is
        processed in RTP mixers, and how that interacts with ECN feedback.

Implementation considerations</h3>

<p>To allow the use of ECN with RTP over UDP, the RTP implementation
      must be able to set the ECT bits in outgoing UDP datagrams, and must be
      able to read the value of the ECT bits on received UDP datagrams. The
      standard Berkeley sockets API pre-dates the specification of ECN, and
      does not provide the functionality which is required for this mechanism
      to be used with UDP flows, making this specification difficult to
      implement portably.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The usage of ECN with RTP over UDP as specified in this document has
      the following known security issues that needs to be considered.
</p>
<p>External threats to the RTP and RTCP traffic:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Denial of Service affecting RTCP:</dt>
<dd>For an attacker that
          can modify the traffic between the media sender and a receiver can
          achieve either of two things. 1. Report a lot of packets as being
          Congestion Experience marked, thus forcing the sender into a
          congestion response. 2. Ensure that the sender disable the usage of
          ECN by reporting failures to receive ECN by changing the counter
          fields. The Issue, can also be accomplished by injecting false RTCP
          packets to the media sender. Reporting a lot of CE marked traffic is
          likely the more efficient denial of service tool as that may likely
          force the application to use lowest possible bit-rates. The
          prevention against an external threat is to integrity protect the
          RTCP feedback information and authenticate the sender of it.
</dd>
<dt>Information leakage:</dt>
<dd>The ECN feedback mechanism
          exposes the receivers perceived packet loss, what packets it
          considers to be ECN-CE marked and its calculation of the ECN-none.
          This is mostly not considered sensitive information. If considered
          sensitive the RTCP feedback shall be encrypted.
</dd>
<dt>Changing the ECN bits</dt>
<dd>An on-path attacker that see the
          RTP packet flow from sender to receiver and who has the capability
          to change the packets can rewrite ECT into ECN-CE thus forcing the
          sender or receiver to take congestion control response. This denial
          of service against the media quality in the RTP session is
          impossible for en end-point to protect itself against. Only network
          infrastructure nodes can detect this illicit remarking. It will be
          mitigated by turning off ECN, however, if the attacker can modify
          its response to drop packets the same vulnerability exist.
</dd>
<dt>Denial of Service affecting the session set-up signalling:</dt>
<dd>If
          an attacker can modify the session signalling it can prevent the
          usage of ECN by removing the signalling attributes used to indicate
          that the initiator is capable and willing to use ECN with RTP/UDP.
          This attack can be prevented by authentication and integrity
          protection of the signalling. We do note that any attacker that can
          modify the signalling has more interesting attacks they can perform
          than prevent the usage of ECN, like inserting itself as a middleman
          in the media flows enabling wire-tapping also for an off-path
          attacker.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The following are threats that exist from misbehaving senders or
      receivers:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Receivers cheating</dt>
<dd>A receiver may attempt to cheat and
          fail to report reception of ECN-CE marked packets. The benefit for a
          receiver cheating in its reporting would be to get an unfair
          bit-rate share across the resource bottleneck. It is far from
          certain that a receiver would be able to get a significant larger
          share of the resources. That assumes a high enough level of
          aggregation that there are flows to acquire shares from. The risk of
          cheating is that failure to react to congestion results in packet
          loss and increased path delay. To mitigate the risk of cheating
          receivers the solution include ECN-Nonce that makes it
          probabilistically unlikely that a receiver can cheat for more than a
          few packets before being found out. See <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC3540'>[RFC3540]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Spring, N., Wetherall, D., and D. Ely, &ldquo;Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> for more
          discussion.
</dd>
<dt>Receivers misbehaving:</dt>
<dd>A receiver may prevent the
          usage of ECN in an RTP session by reporting itself as non ECN
          capable or simple provide invalid ECN-nonce values. Thus forcing the
          sender to turn off usage of ECN. In a point-to-point scenario there
          is little incentive to do this as it will only affect the receiver.
          Thus failing to utilise an optimisation. For multi-party session
          there exist some motivation why a receiver would misbehave as it can
          prevent also the other receivers from using ECN. As an insider into
          the session it is difficult to determine if a receiver is
          misbehaving or simply incapable, making it basically impossible in
          the incremental deployment phase of ECN for RTP usage to determine
          this. If additional information about the receivers and the network
          is known it might be possible to deduce that a receiver is
          misbehaving. If it can be determined that a receiver is misbehaving,
          the only response is to exclude it from the RTP session and ensure
          that is doesn't any longer have any valid security context to affect
          the session.
</dd>
<dt>Misbehaving Senders:</dt>
<dd>The enabling of ECN gives the
          media packets a higher degree of probability to reach the receiver
          compared to not-ECT marked ones. However, this is no magic bullet
          and failure to react to congestion will most likely only slightly
          delay a buffer under-run, in which its session also will experience
          packet loss and increased delay. There are some chance that the
          media senders traffic will push other traffic out of the way without
          being effected to negatively. However, we do note that a media
          sender still needs to implement congestion control functions to
          prevent the media from being badly affected by congestion events.
          Thus the misbehaving sender is getting a unfair share. This can only
          be detected and potentially prevented by network monitoring and
          administrative entities. See Section 7 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> for more discussion of this issue.
</dd>
<dt>ECN as covert channel:</dt>
<dd>As the ECN fields two bits can
          be set to two different values for ECT, it is possible to use ECN as
          a covert channel with a possible bit-rate of one or two bits per
          packet. For more discussion of this issue please see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tsvwg&#8209;ecn&#8209;tunnel]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>We note that the end-point security functions needs to prevent an
      external attacker from affecting the solution easily are source
      authentication and integrity protection. To prevent what information
      leakage there can be from the feedback encryption of the RTCP is also
      needed. For RTP there exist multiple solutions possible depending on the
      application context. <a class='info' href='#RFC3711'>Secure RTP (SRTP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baugher, M., McGrew, D., Naslund, M., Carrara, E., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3711]
      does satisfy the requirement to protect this mechanism despite only
      providing authentication if a entity is within the security context or
      not. <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>IPsec<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4301] and <a class='info' href='#RFC4347'>DTLS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E. and N. Modadugu, &ldquo;Datagram Transport Layer Security,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4347] can also provide the necessary security
      functions.
</p>
<p>The signalling protocols used to initiate an RTP session also needs
      to be source authenticated and integrity protected to prevent an
      external attacker from modifying any signalling. Here an appropriate
      mechanism to protect the used signalling needs to be used. For SIP/SDP
      ideally <a class='info' href='#RFC3851'>S/MIME<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramsdell, B., &ldquo;Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.1 Message Specification,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3851] would be used. However,
      with the limited deployment a minimal mitigation strategy is to require
      use of <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>SIPS (SIP over TLS)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261] <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-sips'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;sips]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F., &ldquo;The use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> to at least accomplish hop-by-hop
      protection.
</p>
<p>We do note that certain mitigation methods will require network
      functions.

<ol class="text">
<li>Packet duplication. Packet duplication results in uncertainties

          and ignoring their ECN marks may also be problematic. Consider the

<li>The negotiation and directionality attribute is going to need
          some consideration for multi-party sessions when readonly capability
