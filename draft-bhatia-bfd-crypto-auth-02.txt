Abstract 
    
   This document proposes an extension for Bidirectional Forwarding 
   Detection (BFD) to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication 
   algorithm in addition to the already documented authentication 
   schemes, described in the base specification.   
        
   Although this document has been written specifically to introduce two 
   new Authentication types it describes how BFD can use National 
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Secure Hash Standard 
   family of algorithms (SHS) to authenticate the control packets, the 
   method described in this document is generic and can be used to 
   extend BFD to support any cryptographic hash function in the future.

Internet Draft    BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication   June 2010 
 
 
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] specification 
   includes five different types of authentication schemes: Simple 
   Password, Keyed MD5 [RFC1321], Meticulous Keyed MD5, Keyed SHA-1 and 
   Meticulous SHA-1. In the simple password scheme of authentication, 
   the passwords are exchanged in the clear text on the network and 
   anyone with physical access to the network can learn the password and 
   compromise the security of the BFD domain.  
    
   In Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Keyed MD5, the BFD routers share a secret 
   key which is used to generate a keyed MD5 digest for each packet and 
   a monotonically increasing sequence number scheme is used to prevent 
   replay attacks.  
    
   This isnt good enough as there have been recent reports about attacks    
   on MD5 which raises concerns about the remaining useful lifetime of    
   this scheme. Specifically, the researchers have been able to develop   
   algorithms that can compute hash collisions for some applications of   
   MD5 [MD5-attack] [Dobb96a, Dobb96b].      
    
   It should however be noted that these attacks may not necessarily 
   result in direct vulnerabilities in Keyed-MD5 as used in BFD 
   authentication purposes, because the colliding message may not 
   necessarily be a syntactically correct protocol packet. However, 
   there is a need felt to move away from MD5 towards more complex and 
   difficult to break hash algorithms.  
    
   In Keyed SHA-1 and Meticulous SHA-1, the BFD routers share a secret 
   key which is used to generate a keyed SHA-1 digest for each packet 
   and a monotonically increasing sequence number scheme is used to 
   prevent replay attacks. 
    
   Like MD5 there have been reports of attacks on SHA-1 [SHA-1-attack1] 
   [SHA-1-attack2]. Such attacks do not mean that all the protocols 
   using SHA-1 for authentication are at risk. However, it does mean 
   that SHA-1 should be replaced as soon as possible and should not be 
   used for new applications. 
    
   It should be noted that if SHA-1 is used in the Hashed Message 
   Authentication Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] construction then collision 
   attacks currently known against SHA-1 do not apply. The new attacks 
   on SHA-1 have no impact on the security of HMAC-SHA-1.  
    
   HMAC can be used, without modifying any hash function, for 
   calculating and verifying the message authentication values. It 
   verifies both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message.  
    
   This document proposes two new authentication types - the 
   cryptographic authentication (CRYPTO_AUTH) and the meticulous 
   cryptographic authentication (MET_ CRYPTO_AUTH). These can be used to

Internet Draft    BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication   June 2010 
 
 
   specify any authentication algorithm for authenticating and verifying 
   the BFD packets.  
    
   By definition, HMAC requires a cryptographic hash function. We 
   propose to use any one of Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) defined in US 
   NIST Secure Hash Standard (SHS) [FIPS-180-3]. [FIPS-180-3] includes 
   SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The HMAC 
   authentication mode defined in NIST FIPS 198 is used [FIPS-198]. 
    
   It is believed that [RFC2104] is mathematically identical to 
   [FIPS-198] and it is also believed that algorithms in [RFC4634] are 
   mathematically identical to [FIPS-180-3]. 
    
   Of the above, implementations of this specification MUST include   
   support for at least HMAC-SHA-256 and SHOULD include support for 
   HMAC-SHA-1 and MAY include support for either of HMAC-SHA-384 or 
   HMAC-SHA-512. 
    
   An implementation of this specification MUST allow network operators   
   to configure ANY authentication algorithm supported by that   
   implementation for use with ANY given KeyID value that is configured   
   into that BFD router. 
    
2. BFD Security Association 
    
   The BFD protocol does not include an in-band mechanism to create or 
   manage BFD Security Associations (BFD SA). A BFD SA contains a set of 
   shared parameters between any two legitimate BFD routers.  
    
   Parameters associated with a BFD SA: 
    
   O Authentication Key Identifier (Key ID) : This is a two octet 
   unsigned integer used to uniquely identify the BFD SA, as manually 
   configured by the network operator (or, in the future, possibly by 
   some key management protocol specified by the IETF). The receiver 
   determines the active SA by looking at this field in the incoming 
   packet. The sender puts this Key ID in the BFD packet based on the 
   active configuration.  
    
   Using Key IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol 
   operation convenient. Each key ID specifies two independent parts, 
   the authentication protocol and the authentication key, as explained 
   below. Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator 
   to configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the chain 
   having fixed lifetime. The actual operation of these mechanisms is 
   outside the scope of this document. 
    
   Note that each Key ID can indicate a key with a different 
   authentication protocol. This allows multiple authentication

   mechanisms to be used at various times without disrupting BFD 
   sessions, including the introduction of new authentication 
   mechanisms. 
    
   o Authentication Algorithm : This indicates the authentication 
   algorithm to be used with the BFD SA. This information SHOULD never 
   be sent in cleartext over the wire. At present, the following values 
   are possible: Keyed MD5, Keyed SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-
   SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512. 
    
   o Authentication Key : This indicates the cryptographic key 
   associated with this BFD SA. The length of this key is variable and 
   depends upon the authentication algorithm specified by the BFD SA. 
   Operators MUST ensure that this is never sent over the network in 
   clear-text via any protocol. Care should also be taken to ensure that 
   the selected key is unpredictable, avoiding any keys known to be weak 
   for the algorithm in use. [RFC4086] contains helpful information on 
   both key generation techniques and cryptographic randomness. This is 
   noted as "K" in section 3.3 below. 
    
3. Authentication Procedures 
 
3.1 Cryptographic Authentication and Meticulous Cryptographic 
    Authentication 
    
   The Authentication section is only present in the BFD packet if the 
   Authentication Present (A) bit is set in the header. The Auth Type in 
   the Authentication section is set to 6 to indicate the Cryptographic 
   Authentication is in use, and is set to 7, to indicate that the 
   meticulous cryptographic authentication is in use. 
    
   Both the authentication types use a monotonically increasing sequence 
   number to protect the BFD session against reply attacks. The only 
   difference between the two types is that the sequence number is 
   occasionally incremented in the Cryptographic Authentication mode, as 
   against the Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication mode, where it is 
   incremented on every packet. 
    
   As a result of this a replay attack is possible till the next 
   sequence number is sent in the Cryptographic Authentication scheme. 
    
3.2 Packet Encoding 
    
   A new authentication type, 6 or 7, indicating the cryptographic 
   authentication mechanism in use, is inserted in the first octet of 
   Authentication Section of the BFD control packet. 
    
   If the Authentication Present (A) bit is set in the header, and the

   Authentication Type field contains 6 (Cryptographic Authentication) 
   or 7 (Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication), the Authentication 
   Section has the following format: 
    
        0                   1                   2                   3

       |                                                               |

   Auth Type 
    
   The Authentication Type, which in this case is 6 (Cryptographic 
   Authentication) or 7 (Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication). 
    
   Auth Len 
    
   Length of the Authentication Section. 
    
   Auth Key ID 
    
   The Authentication Key ID in use for this packet. This allows 
   multiple keys to be active simultaneously. 
    
   Sequence Number 
    
   The Sequence Number for this packet. For Cryptographic Authentication 
   this value is incremented occasionally.  For Meticulous Cryptographic 
   Authentication, this value is incremented for each successive packet 
   transmitted for a session.   
    
   Authentication Data 
    
   This field carries the digest computed by whatever Cryptographic 
   Authentication algorithm is being used to authenticate the BFD 
   control packet. 
    
3.3 Cryptographic Aspects 
    
   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which 
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:

Internet Draft    BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication   June 2010 
 
 
   H    is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256). 
   K    is the password for the BFD packet. 
   Ko   is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm. 
    
   B    is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits. 
    
   Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size. 
        For SHA-1 and SHA-256:   B == 64 
        For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128 
   L    is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits. 
    
   XOR  is the exclusive-or operation. 
   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times. 
   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times. 
   Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times. 
    
   (1)Preparation of the Key 
 
      In this application, Ko is always L octets long. 
    
      If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal 
      to K.  If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long, 
      then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less 
      than L octets long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K) 
      with zeros appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such 
      that Ko is L octets long. 
    
   (2)First Hash 
    
      First, the Authentication Data field in the BFD Auth Section is  
      filled with the value Apad and the Authentication Type field is  
      set to 6 or 7 depending upon which Authentication Type is being  
      used. The Sequence Number field MUST be set to bfd.XmitAuthSeq. 
    
    
      Then, a first hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed 
      as follows: 
    
              First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (BFD Packet)) 
    
   (3)Second Hash 
    
      Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed 
      as follows: 
    
              Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash) 
    
   (4)Result 
    
  
 
Bhatia and Manral         Expires November 2010                [Page 7] 
Internet Draft    BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication   June 2010 
 
 
      The resultant Second-Hash becomes the Authentication Data that is 
      sent in the Authentication Data field of the BFD Authentication  
      Section. The length of the Authentication Data field is always  
      identical to the message digest size of the specific hash function  
      H that is being used. 
    
      This also means that the use of hash functions with larger output  
      sizes will also increase the size of BFD Packet as transmitted  
      on the wire. 
    
3.4 Procedures at the Sending Side 
    
   An appropriate BFD SA is selected for use with an outgoing BFD 
   packet. This is done based on the active key at that instant. If BFD   
   is unable to find an active key, the BFD packet is discarded.  
        
   If BFD is able to find the active key, then the key gives the 
   authentication algorithm (HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384 or 
   HMAC-SHA-512) that needs to be applied on the packet. 
    
   An implementation MUST fill the Auth Type and the Auth length before 
   the authentication data is computed. The Sequence Number field MUST 
   be set to bfd.XmitAuthSeq. 
    
   The Auth length in the Authentication section is set as per the 
   authentication algorithm that is being used. It is set to 28 for 
   HMAC-SHA-1, 40 for HMAC-SHA-256, 56 for HMAC-SHA-384 and 72 for HMAC-
   SHA-512. 
    
   The Key ID is filled. 
    
   The authentication data is computed as explained in the previous 
   section. 
    
   The result of the authentication algorithm is placed in the 
   Authentication data, following the Key ID. 
    
    
3.5 Procedure at the Receiving Side 
    
   The appropriate BFD SA is identified by looking at the Key ID from 
   the Authentication Section from the incoming BFD packet. 
    
   If the Auth Key ID field does not match the ID of a configured      
   authentication key, the received packet MUST be discarded. 
    
   If bfd.AuthSeqKnown is 1, examine the Sequence Number field.  For      
   Cryptographic Authentication, if the Sequence Number lies outside of 
   the range of bfd.RcvAuthSeq to bfd.RcvAuthSeq+(3*Detect Mult)

Internet Draft    BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication   June 2010 
 
 
   inclusive (when treated as an unsigned 32 bit circular number space), 
   the received packet MUST be discarded.  For Meticulous Cryptographic 
   Authentication, if the Sequence Number lies outside of the range of 
   bfd.RcvAuthSeq+1 to bfd.RcvAuthSeq+(3*Detect Mult) inclusive (when 
   treated as an unsigned 32 bit circular number space, the received 
   packet MUST be discarded. 
    
   Authentication Algorithm dependent processing, needs to be performed, 
   using the algorithm specified by the appropriate BFD SA for the 
   received packet. 
    
   Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to save the 
   values of the Authentication Value field. 
    
   It should then set the Authentication Value field with Apad before 
   the authentication data is computed. The calculated data is compared 
   with the received authentication data in the packet and the packet is 
   discarded if the two do not match. In such a case, an error event 
   SHOULD be logged. 
    
   An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes 
   CRYPTO_AUTH or the MET_CRYPTO_AUTH information in the packets but 
   does not verify this information. This is provided as a transition 
   aid for networks in the process of migrating to the new CRYPTO_AUTH 
   and MET_CRYPTO_AUTH based authentication schemes.     
    
4. Security Considerations  
    
   This document enhances the security of the BFD protocol by adding, to 
   the existing BFD cryptographic authentication methods, support for 
   the algorithms defined in the NIST Secure Hash Standard (SHS) using 
   the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mode, and by adding 
   support for the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mode. It 
   does not provide confidentiality as BFD contains information that 
   does not need to be kept secret.  
    
   Because all of the currently specified algorithms use symmetric 
   cryptography, one cannot authenticate precisely which BFD router   
   sent a given packet. However, one can authenticate that the sender   
   knew the BFD Security Association (including the BFD SA's parameters) 
   currently in use. 
    
   The technology in this document provides an authentication mechanism  
   for BFD.  The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not  
   need to be perfect. Instead, this mechanism represents a significant  
   increase in the work function of an adversary attacking the BFD 
   protocol, while not causing undue implementation, deployment, or  
   operational complexity.

   There is a transition mode suggested where routers can ignore the  
   CRYPTO_AUTH or the MET_CRYPTO_AUTH information carried in the  
   packets. The operator must ensure that this mode is only used when  
   migrating to the new CRYPTO_AUTH/MET_CRYPTO_AUTH based authentication  
   scheme as this leaves the router vulnerable to an attack. 
    
   To ensure greater security, the keys used should be changed  
   periodically and implementations MUST be able to store and use more  
   than one key at the same time. The quality of the security provided 
   by the Cryptographic Authentication option depends completely on the 
   strength of the cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic mode in 
   use, the strength of the key being used, and the correct 
   implementation of the security mechanism in all communicating BFD 
   implementations.  Accordingly, the use of high assurance development 
   methods is recommended.  It also requires that all parties maintain 
   the secrecy of the shared secret key.  [RFC4086] provides guidance on 
   methods for generating cryptographically random bits. 
    
   The value Apad is used here primarily for consistency with IETF   
   specifications for HMAC-SHA authentication of RIPv2 SHA [RFC4822],
