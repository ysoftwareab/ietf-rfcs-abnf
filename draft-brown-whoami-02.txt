1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a protocol which provides a way for the
   operator of a domain name to publish their contact information in a
   discoverable and machine-readable format.

   It serves as a complementary service to WHOIS ([RFC3912]) and RDAP
   ([RFC7480]), and differs in that it relies on self-publication by the
   domain operator, rather than a centralised third party service.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  WHOAMI Protocol

   Domain Operators MAY publish a WHOAMI Record in conformance with this
   specification.  It may be published (a) at a URL indicated by a URI
   record [RFC7553] published in the DNS (as described in Section 2.1),
   or (b) at a well-known URL (as described in Section 2.2).

   Software which consumes WHOAMI records SHOULD first perform a DNS
   query for the URI record for a domain, falling back to the well-known
   URL if the query does not return a positive result.

Internet-Draft                   WHOAMI                        June 2018


2.1.  URI Record

   Domain Operators MAY publish the URL of their WHOAMI record as a URI
   record in the DNS.  An example of such a record is below:

   $ORIGIN example.com.
   _nicname._tcp IN URI 10 1 https://example.com/whoami/whoami.vcf

   Note: the Owner Name, Priority, Weight, Target and URI in the above
   record are illustrative only.

   The Service Tag of the URI record is constructed as per Section 4.1
   of [RFC7553], with the "_nicname" tag being derived from the "Who Is
   Protocol" entry in the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port
   Number Registry (see [RFC6335]).

2.1.1.  URI Record with a data: scheme

   Domain Operators MAY publish a record with a "data:" scheme
   ([RFC2397]).  This allows the WHOAMI record to be embedded in the URI
   record itself.  An example of such a URI is below:

   data:text/vcard;charset=utf-8;base64,QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNClZFUlNJT046NC4w
   DQpVSUQ6dXJuOnV1aWQ6NGZiZTg5NzEtMGJjMy00MjRjLTljMjYtMzZjM2UxZWZmNmIxD
   QpGTjtQSUQ9MS4xOkouIERvZQ0KTjpEb2U7Si47OzsNCkVNQUlMO1BJRD0xLjE6amRvZU
   BleGFtcGxlLmNvbQ0KQ0xJRU5UUElETUFQOjE7dXJuOnV1aWQ6NTNlMzc0ZDktMzM3ZS0
   0NzI3LTg4MDMtYTFlOWMxNGUwNTU2DQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=

   If a "data:" scheme is used, the MIME type of the data MUST be "text/
   vcard".

2.2.  Well-Known URL

   Domain Operators MAY publish their WHOAMI record at the following
   URL:

   http://example.com/.well-known/whoami/whoami.vcf

   The "whoami" path segment has been registered in the "Well-Known URI
   Registry" (see [RFC5785]).

   It is RECOMMENDED that web servers which support HTTP over Transport
   Layer Security (TLS, [RFC2818]) provide a 3xx redirect to the HTTPS
   version of this URL.

   Software which consumes WHOAMI records MUST follow 3xx redirections
   return in server responses.

   The Content-Type header of the server response MUST be "text/vcard".

3.  Security Considerations

   WHOAMI provides no security capabilities above and beyond those
   provided by the underlying protocols it uses, namely DNS and HTTP.

   WHOAMI records in general will not be confidential: while HTTPS
   provides transport-layer security, unless some form of authentication
   is used, WHOAMI records will be freely available to anyone who
   requests them.  Authentication of client requests is not covered by
   this document.

   The integrity of WHOAMI records served over DNS may be verified using
   DNSSEC validation.  The use of TLS ensures that records served over
   HTTPS have not been modified in-transit.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   Since WHOAMI records are not private, the information included in a
   WHOAMI record is exposed to the public.  Domain owners should
   therefore exercise caution when entering information into their
   WHOAMI record.  For example, rather than publishing the contact
   informations of people, role-based contact information SHOULD be used
   instead.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the "whoami" well-known URI in the
   "Well-Known URIs" registry as defined by [RFC5785].

   URI suffix: whoami
