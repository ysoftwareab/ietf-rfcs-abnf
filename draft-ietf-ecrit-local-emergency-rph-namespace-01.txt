   This document creates and IANA registers the new Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority header (RPH) namespace "esnet" for 
   local emergency usage to a public safety answering point (PSAP), 
   between PSAPs, and between a PSAP and first responders and their

1.  Introduction

   This document creates and IANA registers the new Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority header (RPH) namespace "esnet" for 
   local emergency usage.  The SIP Resource-Priority header is defined 
   in RFC 4412 [RFC4412]. This new namespace within the public safety 
   answering point (PSAP) network ("ESInet").  This new namespace can 
   be used for inbound calls to PSAPs, between PSAPs, and between a 
   PSAP and first responders and their organizations.  

   Within controlled environments, such as an IMS infrastructure or 
   Emergency Services network (ESInet), where misuse can be reduced to 
   a minimum where possible, this namespace is to be to provide an 
   explicit priority indication facilitates treatment of emergency SIP 
   messages according to local policy.  This indication is used to 
   differentiate SIP requests, or dialogs, from other requests or 
   dialogs that do not have the need for priority treatment.

   It can also be imagined that Voice Service Providers (VSP) directly 
   attached to an ESInet can have a trust relationship with the ESInet 
   such that within these networks, SIP requests (thereby the session 
   they establish) make use of this "esnet" namespace for appropriate 
   treatment.

   Usage of the "esnet" namespace is to be defined in a future 
   document(s). This document merely creates the namespace, per the 
   rules within [RFC4412] necessitating a Standards Track RFC for

Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Feb 2009

   IANA registering new RPH namespaces and their relative 
   priority-value order.   [RFC4412] further states that modifying the 
   order or the number of priority-values to a registered namespace 
   SHOULD NOT occur, due to interoperability issues with dissimilar 
   implementations. 

   From this fact about RFC 4412, and the possibility that within 
   emergency services networks, a Multilevel Precedence and Preemption 
   (MLPP)-like behavior can be achieved - ensuring more important calls
   are established or retained, the "esnet" namespace is given 5 
   priority-levels.  MLPP-like SIP signaling is not defined in this 
   document for 911/112/999 style emergency calling, but it is not 
   prevented either.

   Within the ESINet, there will be emergency calls requiring different
   treatments, according to the type of call.  Does a citizen's call to
   a PSAP require the same, a higher or a lower relative priority than 
   a PSAP's call to a police department, or the police chief?  What 
   about either relative to a call from within the ESINet to a 
   federal government's department of national security, such as the US
   Department of Homeland Security?  For this reason, the "esnet" 
   namespace is given multiple priority levels.

   This document does not define any of these behaviors, outside of 
   reminding readers that the rules of RFC 4412 apply - though examples
   of usage are included for completeness.  This document IANA 
   registers the "esnet" RPH namespace for use within emergency 
   services networks, not just of those from citizens to PSAPs.


2.  Rules of Usage of the Resource Priority Header

   This document updates the behaviors of the SIP Resource Priority 
   header, defined in [RFC4412], during the treatment options 
   surrounding this new "esnet" namespace only. The usage of the 
   "esnet" namespace does not have a normal, or routine call level.  
   Every use of this namespace will be in times of an emergency, where 
   at least one end of the signaling is with a local emergency 
   organization.

   The "esnet" namespace has 5 priority-values, in a specified relative 
   priority order, and is a queue-based treatment namespace [RFC4412]. 
   Individual jurisdictions MAY configure their SIP entities for 
   preemption treatment, but this is optional, and a local policy 
   decision.

   Conceivably, this could be an example of a generic network diagram 
   where the "esnet" namespace is used:

       Figure 1: Where 'esnet' Namespace Can or Will be used

   In Figure 1., the "esnet" namespace is intended for usage within the
   ESInet on the right side of the diagram.  How it is utilized is out 
   of scope for this document.  Adjacent VSPs to the ESInet MAY have a 
   trust relationship that includes allowing this neighboring VSP to 
   use the "esnet" namespace to differentiate SIP requests and dialogs 
   within the VSP network.  How this namespace is utilized is out of 
   scope for this document.  Because the more important usage of the 
   "esnet" namespace occurs within the ESInet, the edge proxy, called 
   an Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) can modify or delete this
   namespace. This is a normative change to the allowed behavior within
   [RFC4412], but MUST only be considered valid in this usage at the 
   ESInet boundary for this one RP namespace (and associated 
   priority-value).  The exact mapping between the sides of the ESRP at
   the ESInet boundary are out of scope of this document.

3.  "esnet" Namespace Definition

   One thing to keep in mind for now is the fact that this namespace 
   is not to be considered just "EMERGENCY" because there are a lot of 
   different kinds of emergencies, some on a military scale ([RFC4412] 
   defines 3 of these), some on a national scale ([RFC4412] defines 2 
   of these), some on an international scale.  These types of 
   emergencies can also have their own namespaces, and although there 
   are 5 defined for other uses, more are possible - so the 911/112/999
   style of public user emergency calling for police or fire or 
   ambulance (etc) does not have a monopoly on the word "emergency".

   Therefore, the namespace "esnet" has been chosen, as it is most 
   recognizable as that of citizen's call for help from a public 
   authority type of organization.  This namespace will also be used 
   for communications between emergency authorities, and MAY be used 
   for emergency authorities calling public citizens.  An example of 
   the later is a PSAP operator calling back someone who previously 
   called 9111/112/999 and the communication was terminated before it 
   should have been (in the operator's judgment).

   Here is an example of a Resource-Priority header using the esnet 
   namespace:

      Resource-Priority: esnet.0

3.1.  Namespace Definition Rules and Guidelines

   This specification defines one unique namespace for emergency 
   calling scenarios, "esnet", constituting its registration with IANA. 
   This IANA registration contains the facets defined in Section 9 of 
   [RFC4412].  

3.2.  The "esnet" Namespace

   Per the rules of [RFC4412], each namespace has a finite set of 
   relative priority-value(s), listed (below) from lowest priority to 
   highest priority.  In an attempt to not limit this namespace's use 
   in the future, more than one priority-value is assigned to the 
   "esnet" namespace.  This document does not RECOMMEND which 
   priority-value is used where.  That is for another document to 
   specify.  This document does RECOMMEND the choice within a national 
   jurisdiction be coordinated by all sub-jurisdictions to maintain 
   uniform SIP behavior throughout an emergency calling system.

   The relative priority order for the "esnet" namespace is as follows:

      (lowest)  esnet.0
                esnet.1
                esnet.2
                esnet.3
      (highest) esnet.4

Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Feb 2009


   The "esnet" namespace will be assigned into the priority queuing 
   algorithm (Section 4.5.2 of [RFC4412]) from the public user to the 
   PSAP.  This does not limit its usage to only the priority queue 
   algorithm; meaning the preemption algorithm can be used where the 
   local jurisdiction preferred to preempt normal calls in lieu of 
   completing emergency calls.  This document is not RECOMMENDING this 
   usage, merely pointing out those behaviors are a matter of local 
   policy.

   NOTE: at this time, there has not been sufficient discussion about 
   whether or not preemption will be used for communications between 
   PSAPs or between PSAPs and First responders (and their 
   organizations).


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" of the sip-parameters 
   section of IANA (created by [RFC4412]), the following entries will 
   be added to this table:

                        Intended      New warn-   New resp.
   Namespace  Levels    Algorithm     code        code      Reference
   ---------  ------  --------------  ---------   --------- ---------
     esnet      5        queue           no          no     [This doc]


4.2  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the Resource-Priority Priority-values registry of the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following (below) is to be added 
   to the table:

   Namespace: esnet
   Reference: (this document)
   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1","2", "3", "4"


5.  Security Considerations

   The Security considerations that apply to RFC 4412 [RFC4412] apply 
   here.  

   The implications of using this header-value incorrectly can cause a 
   large impact on a network - given that this indication is to give 
   preferential treatment of marked traffic great preference within the
   network than other traffic.  This document does not indicate this 
   marking is intended for use by endpoints, yet protections need to be
   taken to prevent granting preferential treatment to unauthorized

   users not calling for emergency help.  

   A simple means of preventing this usage is to not allow marked 
   traffic preferential treatment unless the destination is towards the
   local/regional ESInet.  911/112/999 type of calling is fairly local 
   in nature, with a finite number of URIs that are considered valid.
