1.  Introduction

   Handover services are a class of network services, which aim to
   assist the quality of handovers available to wireless devices.  In
   order to support more intelligent handover services it is often
   necessary to be able to exchange information between mobile and fixed
   nodes within the network.  A comprehensive description of the problem
   related to this aspect can be found in [2].

   Information Services (IS) are one part of handover services used to
   provide network related information about the current or neighboring
   networks with same or different access link technology.  This allows
   the network or host to make informed decisions of which network to
   handover to or handover operations to undertake either in response to
   certain events, or when planning controlled or commanded handovers.
   The Information Services work complementary to the mobility
   management protocols in the capacity that they are utilized before
   making decisions for handovers.

   While the IETF is primarily interested in how handover services can
   be used to assist mobility signaling protocols, and interactions
   between handover services and network/transport layers, other groups
   have been taking a more generally applicable view (see Section 2).

1.1.  Information Services

   Information Services are considered to be an important component of
   handover services, for providing local network information to
   wireless devices in a non-real-time fashion [1].

   Information services provide additional information about the
   environment a mobile device is operating in.  These services
   typically require one or more servers within a set of access
   networks, which distribute knowledge that can assist hosts performing
   handovers between cells.

   Information provided varies dependent on the purpose and operation of
   the information service, but may consist of: wireless channel state,
   adjacent base-station channel occupation, neighboring network
   information or upper-layer mobility service information.  While each
   of these is possible, it is important to note that information
   services described in this document have a restricted scope described
   below in Section 1.2.  This scope is limited in order to achieve
   timely outcomes for document development and standardization.

1.2.  Scope of work on information services

   The development of information services covered in this document



Sreemanthula (Ed.), et al.  Expires September 7, 2006           [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Requirements for an IS               March 2006


   assume a set of models compatible with IEEE 802.21's descriptions of
   a Handover Information Service,as described in Section 2.  In this
   context, a system would need to provide discovery, security
   association bootstrap and transport of information services over IP,
   in a variety of deployment scenarios.  These scenarios are described
   in Section 4.  The extent of protocol development work to be
   undertaken is elaborated on in Section 5.

   Initial specification of use cases will focus on delivery services
   required by the existing client (802.21), in the hope that the scheme
   is general enough to be of use in the other cases [1].


2.  802.21 Media Independent Information Services

   IEEE is currently working on Information Services as part of 802.21
   Media Independent Handover Services (MIHS).

   Amongst media independent handover services, information services are
   most readily deployed over IP [1].  In the 802.21 case, link-layer
   oriented information would then be distributed over IP and upper-
   layer protocols.

   For these information services, it is possible that network
   information may be either centrally stored on a server or distributed
   in each individual access network.  Presumably, an L2 or L3 based
   mechanism to identify or discover a valid information server would be
   required.  Such scenarios are described in more detail in Section 4.

   In order to accomplish this, it will be necessary to describe IS
   discovery and specify transport services over IP.  Interactions with
   IP in delivering handover services over IP therefore need
   consideration in the IETF, both for use with 802.21 and for other
   instances of handover services [22].


3.  Information Service Reference Model

   Entities involved with handover information services perform the
   roles of an Information Services client (IS client), Information
   Services Proxy and an Information Services server (IS-Server).
   Relative positions of client and server, and the interfaces between
   them may produce different requirements, depending on the type of
   communication.  Essentially, they fall under the category of i) user
   to network communications (UNC) or ii) network to network
   communications (NNC).

   Figure 1 presents a reference model for both for single and mutihop

   communication of Information Services.  The reference model shows
   both client-server, client-proxy-server and client-server-server
   models.  The IS-Proxy role is to forward or route the IS
   communications to the intended destination IS-Server.  IS-Server
   terminated IS communications, however it may initiate a new IS
   communications with another IS-Server.  It is possible that IS-Proxy
   may present server-server communication path.  The IS-Proxy and the
   IS-Server may reside either within its administrative domain, or in
   another domain.

         |  IS-client|<-------|------>|IS-Server|
         ------------        UNC      -----------



         ------------                 -----------                 -----------
         |  IS-Client|<-------|------>|IS-Proxy | <-----|------> | IS-Server|

         ------------        UNC      -----------      NNC        -----------



   Figure 1: Information Services Reference Model and Interfaces

   In order to support the above models, an Information Service system
   would need to provide more services than just a transport functions
   such as, discovery of proxy and Information servers, security
   association between client-server, client-proxy-server, proxy-server
   and server-server in a variety of deployment scenarios.


4.  Scenarios for IS Transported over IP

   In the general case, Information Services delivery over IP may be
   applicable to more than just media independent handovers.  What is
   likely to be held in common are deployment scenarios, which detail
   particular challenges dealt with by the information service, and the
   consequent requirements from these services.

   The models described above for information services allow deployment
   of IS Information Servers anywhere within the visited network domain.
   In this section example scenarios are described indicating where

Internet-Draft           Requirements for an IS               March 2006


   information services are likely to be deployed.  Descriptions of
   particular characteristics of these deployments are made, especially
   where the deployments place requirements on any information service
   transportation deployed over IP.

   In each of the diagrams (Figure 2 and Figure 3) below, a mobile
   device is currently connected to a particular wireless cell, serviced
   by an Access Point.  In order to gain information about other
   wireless cells in the vicinity, it contacts an information server
   within the fixed network.

   If IP is used for information services transport, for example, in
   (Figure 2), the server is co-located in the router.  There the router
   has access to the upper layer information required to assist
   handovers [1][22].

   While information services delivery in this scenario is partly
   addressed by experimental information services in CARD and FMIPv6,
   the authors consider a fresh look at these issues are warranted,
   particularly to establish the applicability of security association
   establishment mechanisms in these and other environments [21][22].

   Figure 2: IS-Server on Subnet Router

   Information service servers deployed outside the mobile node's subnet
   present both advantages and challenges.  As illustrated in Figure 3,
   an IS-Server outside a subnet doesn't require explicit support from
   devices the mobile's link.  Therefore the server is able to be
   deployed in networks which are not able to be modified easily.
   Additionally, the server is in a position to serve many access
   subnets simultaneously, which reduces administrative overheads.

   Conversely, network support for discovering the IS-Server becomes
   critically important.  Since a mobile device may roam within a domain
   though, it may not be necessary to discover the server each time it
   changes subnet, so long as the mobile remains in the set of networks
   covered by the server.  Discovery mechanisms are covered in more
   detail in Section 5.3.

   Additionally, the location of information services addressable
   outside the subnet has security implications which are described in
   Section 7.

   Figure 3: Standalone IS-Server

   As described in [1], information services may potentially retrieve
   different types of data from different sources.  Where this data is
   also used for different purposes within the recipient host, it may be
   useful to segregate the discovery and operation of information
   services for different classes of data onto separate servers.

   At discovery time, the discovery operation could then respond with
   service advertisements describing which services are provided on
   which servers, potentially indicating that one information class is
   available on one server and one on another.

   While this scenario is not explicitly supported in 802.21, where
   service discovery is provided over IP networks, it is feasible to
   request/identify if an information server has a particular service.
   The scenario is illustrated below:

   Figure 4: Separation of Information Content Option

   In Figure 4, separate information classes are shown on the different
   servers.  Discovery of services may indicate that a current SA and
   communication channel to the IS may be reused (for example to the
   central server), while link or access-specific information services
   would be accessed for local information services.

   This is to be contrasted with the previous unified information
   services deployment model from deploying the information server at
   one of the particular locations in or Figure 3.  If information
   services are deployed in multiple servers, it may require additional
   operations to discover all required services.  Also, it could lead to
   additional signalling and computation expenses in bootstrapping
   security associations for each communication.

   As development of information services over IP proceeds, it may be
   valuable to deploy the same discovery and security association
   bootstrap mechanisms for subsequent non-link-layer oriented services.
   In this case, the discovery mechanism would need to be flexible
   enough to accommodate additional information services, or
   combinations of services.


5.  Protocol Development Scope

   This section describes the areas requiring investigation or
   standardization to provide transport of information services over IP.

5.1.  Information Service Interfaces

   Entities involved with handover information services perform the
   roles of an Information Services client (IS client) or an Information
   Services server (IS-Server).  Relative positions of client and
   server, and the interfaces between them produce different
   requirements, depending on the type of communication.

   Illustrated in Figure 5, are a number of devices participating in
   information services exchanges.  On the left-hand side of the figure,
   a mobile IS client contacts an IS-Server in a network device.  If
   this server requires additional information, it may contact another
   IS-Server by becoming a client itself.  This new IS-Server may reside
   either within its administrative domain, or in another domain.

   Figure 5: Relationships between Information Service entities

   The mobile to IS-Proxy/IS-Server (UNI) interface is the primary
   interface requiring standardization by IETF.  Initially, an
   information server must be discovered, as the mobile device will not
   be preconfigured with the server identity.  Subsequently, secured
   communications are established.  This security association may allow
   the mobile to be anonymous, but in some environments, mobile device
   authentication may be used to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
   In any case, message authentication needs to be provided.

   To ensure the validity of data, the IS-Server itself needs to
   authenticate itself to the mobile.  This proves that it is the origin
   of the messages, and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

   After security association establishment, information requests and
   responses are exchanged.

   The IS-Proxy to IS-Server or the IS-Server to IS-Server (NNI)
   interface is required if information servers need to retrieve
   additional information from each other.  For this interface, message
   formats are the same as the UNI interface.  The lifetime of the
   security association may change though, especially in environments
   where servers each act as a requester and a responder.  If this is
   the case, mutual authentication is required between the servers.
   Discovery is considered to be out-of-scope, as in many networks, this
   will be under the control of other network management systems.

5.2.  Message Exchanges

   On the mobile/IS-Server interface a series of steps are required
   before information is able to be delivered back to the mobile node.
   In Figure 6, the steps are illustrated.  The mobile device is
   involved in all exchanges, although dependent on the discovery scheme
   developed for Information Services, it may contact a separate
   directory service in order to locate the IS-Server's address.  The
   figure is shown only as an illustration and not all steps may be
   required for handover information queries.

   Figure 6: Message exchanges required for Information Service
   Operation

   1.  IS-Server Discovery - A message from the mobile to either a
       multicast/anycast group, or a directory service which can be used
       to find an IS-Server.





Sreemanthula (Ed.), et al.  Expires September 7, 2006          [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           Requirements for an IS               March 2006


   2.  IS-Server Address - The response from either a member of a
       multicast/anycast group or the directory server, indicating the
       address of the IS-Server.

   3.  IS-Server Contact - The initial contact operation where the
       mobile tests if the IS-Server is reachable.  This may occur
       within the first message used for Security Association (SA)
       bootstrap.

   4.  Optionally, build Security Associations - Messages exchanged to
       bootstrap SAs with which to protect the data exchange.

   5.  Information Request - The data query packets typically sent from
       the mobile to the IS-Server, protected by the SAs.

   6.  Information Response - A responding set of response packets sent
       from the IS-Server to the requester.  This message is protected
       by the SAs already negotiated.  Where the direct requester was an
       IS-Server, the response goes back to the requester rather than a
       mobile.

   Discovery exchanges (1 and 2) rely upon the underlying discovery
   protocol, as described in Section 5.3.

   Subsequently, secure communications are established (steps 3/4).
   This should make use of an existing applicable, dependent on the
   transport required for information request and responses (steps 5 and
   6).

   Transport layer requirements for information exchanges are described
   in Section 5.4, and additional considerations for security
   association negotiation are provided in Section 5.5.

5.3.  Information Service Discovery

   Discovery by the mobile device of the IS-Server either requires
   Information Server participation in a discovery protocol, network
   entity discovery support or use of a directory service.  The
   directory service can then refer mobiles to an appropriate server for
   their location.

   Discovery mechanisms need to provide IP layer contact information for
   the IS-Server.  Such a discovery system should provide protection
   against spoofing, to prevent attackers substituting bogus information
   servers.

   In IP networks, numerous directory and configuration services already
   exist.  Use of these services either requires support from locally



Sreemanthula (Ed.), et al.  Expires September 7, 2006          [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           Requirements for an IS               March 2006


   discoverable resources within the same IP hop [5][16][19], or rely on
   prior configuration of the unicast address of the directory service
   [13][14][18].  Prior configuration itself may be performed
   dynamically, along with other host services [5][16].

   Network entity discovery, such as Router Discovery [10] could allow
   discovery of an IS server during routing configuration operations.
   If server discovery can be achieved through existing configuration
   discovery procedures, no additional packet exchanges would be
   required to perform discovery.  Strict procedures for modifying
   packet formats with these primitive discovery mechanisms may limit
   the applicability of these techniques though.

   Other non-directory discovery methods require participation by the
   IS-Server in multicast or anycast communication [13].  In this case,
   the access network needs to support this form of routing, although it
   is not aware of the content.  Multicast routing itself requires
   additional routing protocols.  These protocols, while simple to
   operate in constrained domains such as this, are not yet deployed on
   all access routers.  Where the IS server is not on the first IP, this
   prevents discovery protocol operation.

5.4.  Transport-Layer Issues

   The existing ready use of IETF developed transport layer protocols is
   a compelling reason to develop information services transported over
   IP.  Particularly, it is valuable to determine if IS requirements
   match existing transport models and protocols.

   While information services are non-real time, in some scenarios (IS-
   Server within a subnet), the lifetimes of communications with a
   particular server are short.  As such, the sequenced delivery of
   packets using TCP may be too complicated for this application heavy
   handed [3].  TCP fast recovery relies upon delivery of additional
   packets to stimulate additional transmissions of acknowledgements
   from a receiver back to a transmitter.  Where packet exchanges are
   short and sporadic, loss of a packet may not be detected except using
   long retransmission timeouts [4][11][12][15].

   Where existing transport protocols do not incorporate their own
   congestion control and rate limitation, basic mechanisms for network
   protection and congestion recovery may need to be added to IS
   application protocols.

   Additionally, the rich development of security mechanisms which work
   with TCP and other stream oriented communications, encourage its use
   [6].  Recent developments allowing similar session oriented security
   services for datagrams may allow either stream oriented services or



Sreemanthula (Ed.), et al.  Expires September 7, 2006          [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           Requirements for an IS               March 2006


   datagram oriented services to be used or the mobile node's preference
   [26].

5.5.  Security Association Negotiation

   Security is important in IP networks, since there is a danger that
   attacking devices can attempt to adopt roles as information service
   devices.  Such bogus devices could cause service degradation through
   spurious message exchanges, or by providing false information to
   mobile devices.

   IS-Servers need both to protect themselves from attack, and to
   provide mobile clients provable trust, in order that they can make
   handover decisions without fear of malicious inaccuracies or
   mischief.

   Therefore, before exchanging information requests with a new
   information server, a set of Security Associations (SAs) are
   established.  Each SA must to provide message authentication, and
   should provide encryption, for the purposes of mobile device
   anonymity from eavesdroppers.

   The exact SA negotiation mechanism described depends on the transport
   layer used, and security services required.  For example, TLS may be
   applicable if upper layer protocols use TCP, while ESP using IPSec/
   IKE will work in most situations, regardless of the upper layer
   protocol, so long as the IS protocol identifiers are handled by IKE
   [6][7][8].  Other considerations related to flexibility and ease of
   use at the application layer may also play a role in the choice.

   While a mobile device moves within an area serviced by the same IS-
   Server, it can continue to use the same security association, so long
   as the clients IP address doesn't change.  Where the IS-Server is not
   on the same LAN as the mobile, the mobile may move between IP
   networks covered by the same server.  In this case, the IP address of
   the mobile changes.

   If the mobile's address changes, it may be possible to reuse an
   existing SA by updating the addresses to use for communication
   endpoint addresses using Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization, or IKEv2
   session mobility [20][24].  If address update services are not
   available, then it will be necessary to reestablish the security
   association each time the mobile device's address changes.

   o  Enable fast SA setup to handle address mobility.


7.  Security Considerations

   Exchange of Link-layer and handover related information over upper-
   layer protocols such as IP has the potential effect of widening the
   scope of attacks against both the information service's interfaces
   within the network, and the information itself.

7.1.  Attacks against service entities

   Attacks upon information services may prevent one or more devices



Sreemanthula (Ed.), et al.  Expires September 7, 2006          [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           Requirements for an IS               March 2006


   being able to receive handover related information.  As such this may
   cause degradation in handover performance.

   New attacks against information services become possible where link-
   layer information which would otherwise be limited to only one medium
   or bridge span, is subsequently available through an arbitrarily
   large IP subnet.

   Additionally, where information service packets may be requested or
   supplied from beyond the boundaries of a single routed hop, the
   potential scope for attack upon either of the (client or server) IS
   entities is Internet-wide.

   Discovery of the information server is implied as a requirement in
   providing information services transported over IP.  Where the server
   is indicated through link-layer signaling, the robustness of the
   discovery mechanism is largely based on the security of the existing
   link-layer signaling mechanisms.  Where the server discovery is
   performed over IP, special care needs to be taken to ensure that
   discovery may not be hijacked, especially since the underlying
   wireless medium may in some cases be considered vulnerable to such
   attack.

   Link-local scope signaling for either discovery, or both discovery
   and client-server communications reduce the origin of attacks to
   those who are on-link [9].  This may provide a mechanism which
   mitigates the effect of external attacks, but will require service
   entities to exist on every subnet.

7.2.  Attacks against information

   Attacks against the information exchanged between the information
   server and the information client may potentially modify the behavior
   and trust of the client protocol stack.

   Where the integrity and origin of the information delivered to the
   client is not verifiable, the value of the information is degraded,
   as hosts are less able to rely upon the data received.

   Where the client's request is spoofed or modified, additional
   information may be sent to the IS client.  As the mobile node is
   typically upon a lower bandwidth medium than the server, there exists
   potential to deny service to devices on that medium.  Additionally,
   spoofed responses may be acted upon instead of legitimate
   information.  This may lead to handover toward undesirable networks,
   or erratic connectivity.

   Systems which ensure data origin authentication and message integrity



Sreemanthula (Ed.), et al.  Expires September 7, 2006          [Page 16]

   may be able to remove or mitigate some of these effects, by ensuring
   that data arrives as intended back to the client.  It may be
   difficult, though, to bootstrap some types of security association
   considering a potential lack of keying material, computation and
   network bandwidth resources from mobile devices.  Any specified
   integrity protection mechanism therefore needs to be deployable on
   low-powered battery-operated devices which are commonly deployed in
   wireless environments.
