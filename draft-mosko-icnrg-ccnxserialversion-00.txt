Abstract

   This document specifies using a serial number to indicate versions in
   name name segments.  A serial number is an increasing unsigned
   integer with an increment of 1.  Therefore, given one name with a
   serial version number, one may compute the next version number.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies using a serial number in a CCNx name as a
   version identifier.  It specifies a new name segment label and a TLV
   encoding.  The use of a serial number in a name to denote a version
   is limited to coordination among publishers if an attempt is made to
   use a serial number as a distributed ordering.

   Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.
   Because of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no
   concise way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention
   that ASCII art fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact
   bit widths.  Fields with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths,
   which we typically pad out to word alignment for picture readability.

   TODO -- we have not adopted the Requirements Language yet.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

   A serial number in a CCNx name name segment indicates an ordering on
   names based on the unsigned integer.  The serial number is encoded in
   network byte order using the minimum number of bytes.  The value of
   "0" is represented as the single byte %x00.

   The serial number must be incremented by 1 for consecutive versions
   of the prior name name segments.  There is no maximum serial number,
   it is limited only by the number of bytes put in to the name
   component.

   A "GONE" PayloadType means that this version is a terminal version.
   All prior versions should be interpreted as deleted.  A user,
   however, may publish more "DATA" after the terminal version, if he
   decides to un-delete it.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
