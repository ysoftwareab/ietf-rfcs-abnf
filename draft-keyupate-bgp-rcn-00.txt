           Root cause notification to solve BGP path hunting
                     draft-keyupate-bgp-rcn-00.txt

Abstract

   Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism, it
   triggers a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefix
   is completly withdrawn from the entire BGP network.  This phenomenon
   is popularly known as _path exploration_ or _path hunting_ and occurs
   because of path vector property of BGP.  It results in a series of
   unwanted or redundant transitions that overloads the BGP network.

   This document describes a mechanism to help limit the amount of such
   path exploration by defining two optional transitive path attributes
   for BGP: SPEAKERID_PATH and ROOT_CAUSE.

1.  Introduction

   Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism, it
   triggers a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefix
   is completly withdrawn from the entire BGP network.  This phenomenon
   is popularly known as _path exploration_ or _path hunting_ and occurs
   because of path vector property of BGP.  It results in a series of
   unwanted or redundant transitions that overloads the BGP network
   ([I-D.li-bgp-stability]).

   It is interesting to note that these redundant transitions can end up
   triggering route dampening ([RFC2439], if deployed in the network.
   Additionally, route dampening itself is known to cause path
   exploration in the network due to the delay it introduces
   ([I-D.li-bgp-stability]).  This effectively creates a spiral effect
   on BGP instability.  Both the generation of unwanted update messages
   and the triggering of route dampening can adversly affect the BGP
   convergence time.

   The problem lies in the way BGP path vector is defined.  With a link
   state protocol, each router stores a complete view of the entire
   network and derives reachability information from that view.  In the
   event of a flap, each router can correctly determine all paths that
   suffer from the same root cause.  This is not scalable in large
   networks in which BGP operates.  By design, BGP advertises only the
   path it is using in terms of ASes to its neighbors with each prefix.
   Unfortunately, this information is coarse even in a simple topology
   as the number of possible paths through the routers is quite large.
   When a route is not reachable, because the detail route information
   is not included, BGP selection process may end up choosing an
   alternative path that is actually not available.  After sets of such
   transitions, BGP speaker will resolve this abnormality and decide on
   correct available path based on receiver side loop detection.

   This document proposes a mechanism to identify unreachable paths for
   which BGP withdrawals are not received and prevent them from being
   selected as prefered paths.  This helps avoid unnecessary route
   flapping within the network.  A new optional transitive path
   attribute, SPEAKERID_PATH is tagged in BGP announcements as the
   prefix travels through the network, essentially creating more
   granular information about routers in the path.  When a prefix is
   withdrawn, another optional transitive attribute, ROOT_CAUSE is
   attached to the implicit or explicit withdraws that are generated at
   different points in the network.  This attribute is created once at
   the point of occurrence of the fault and gets attached to the
   resulting UPDATE message throughout the network unchanged.  At a
   receiving speaker, the ROOT_CAUSE attribute is matched against the
   SPEAKERID_PATH attributes of available paths to help identify and

   avoid those that are unreachable since they are affected by the same
   root cause.

   Path exploration caused by new prefix advertisements is not discussed
   in this document.

   This trivial example creates unnecessary churn in the network till
   the end state is reached.


3.  SPEAKERID_PATH attribute

   SPEAKERID_PATH is an optional transitive attribute that is very
   similar in encoding and operation to the AS_PATH attribute.  It is
   composed of a sequence of SPEAKERID path segments.  Each segment is
   represented by a triple (type, length, value).  Following is the
   format:



       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |        Type   |   Length      |
      |   (1 octet)   |  (1 octet)    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                               ~
      ~             Value             ~
      ~                               ~

Internet-Draft           Root Cause Notification             August 2010


      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The type is a 1-octet field with the following value defined:


   Value         Type definition

     1           AS_ID_SEQUENCE: ordered set of AS and Speaker ID pair
                 a route in the UPDATE message has traversed.


   The length is a 1-octet field, containing the number of such pairs.
   Thus when the type is 1, the value contains one or more entries of
   the following:


         +---------------------------------+
         |   AS     (4 bytes)              |
         +---------------------------------+
         |   SPEAKER-ID (4 bytes)          |
         +---------------------------------+


   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:

      AS: The AS is a four-octet field that indicates the AS number of
      the BGP speaker.  If this ASN is from the public ASN space, it
      must have been assigned by the appropriate authority (use of ASN
      values from the private ASN space is strongly discouraged).  Note
      that when a four-octet AS supporting speaker (NEW) announces an
      UPDATE to a two-octet AS supporting speaker (OLD), it encodes
      AS_TRANS as a two-octet AS in the AS_PATH attribute instead of its
      own AS ([I-D.ietf-idr-rfc4893bis]).  But while encoding the
      SPEAKERID_PATH attribute, it MUST put its own four-octet AS in
      this field regardless of whether the neighbor to whom the UPDATE
      message is being sent is an OLD or NEW speaker.

      SPEAKER-ID: The SPEAKER-ID is a four-octet field that indicates
      the router-id of the BGP speaker.  If the router-id is from the
      public address space, it must have been assigned by the
      appropriate authority. (use of the private ip address as a
      router-id is strongly discourged).

4.  ROOT_CAUSE attribute

   ROOT_CAUSE is an optional transitive attribute that is composed of
   one or more triple (type, length, value).  Following is the format:



       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |        Type   |   Length      |
      |   (1 octet)   |  (1 octet)    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                               ~
      ~             Value             ~
      ~                               ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The type is a 1-octet field with the following value defined:


 Value         Type definition

   1           AS_ID_CONN: AS and router-ID pairs from both sides of the
               connection that is the point of occurrence for the
               withdraw.


   The length is a 1-octet field, containing the length in octets of the
   value field.  When the type is 1, the value contains the following:



         +--------------+
         |Flags(1 octet)|
         +---------------------------------+
         |   left AS     (4 bytes)         |

         |   left SPEAKER-ID (4 bytes)     |
         +---------------------------------+
         |   right AS    (4 bytes)         |

5.  Operation

5.1.  Sending SPEAKERID_PATH attribute

   When a BGP speaker supporting the mechanism described in this
   document propagates a route it learned from another BGP speaker's
   UPDATE message, it modifies the route's SPEAKERID_PATH attribute by
   prepending its own router-ID and AS number as the last pair of the
   sequence.  If there is no such attribute, the local system creates
   the attribute, creates a new segment in the attribute of type
   AS_ID_SEQUENCE and places its own pair into that segment.  If the act
   of prepending will cause an overflow in the existing segment (i.e.
   more than 255 pairs), it MUST prepend a new segment of type
   AS_ID_SEQUENCE and prepend its own pair to this new segment.  This
   operation should be performed regardless of whether the peer is IBGP
   or EBGP.

5.2.  Sending ROOT_CAUSE attribute

5.2.1.  At the point of occurrence

   A BGP speaker originates the ROOT_CAUSE attribute into an UPDATE
   message in one of the following scenarios:

   o  A session with a peer AS goes down or the associated link goes
      down and the received prefixes need to be withdrawn or their
      bestpath changes.

   o  it receives withdraws for some prefixes without the ROOT_CAUSE
      attribute and they in turn need to be either withdrawn from the
      ASes upstream or re-advertised with new paths.

   While originating the attribute, the speaker encodes the router-ID
   and AS of each side of the session.

5.2.2.  At an intermediate point

   Any speaker receiving a withdrawal UPDATE message with ROOT_CAUSE
   attribute should preserve and announce the resulting UPDATE message
   with the same attribute value.  This can be an explicit withdraw for
   a prefix or an implicit withdraw.

   Any speaker receiving a reachable UPDATE message with ROOT_CAUSE
   attribute should preserve the attribute and not announce the
   attribute in resulting UPDATE message unless the resulting UPDATE
   message is an explicit withdrawal message.

Internet-Draft           Root Cause Notification             August 2010


5.3.  Receiving ROOT_CAUSE Attribute

   Whenever a BGP speaker receives an update message to process
   withdrawn prefixes, it does the following:

   o  Remove the BGP path of the prefix withdrawn.

   o  Find all the other paths that have matching ROOT_CAUSE information
      to the one present in path that is removed.  Place these paths on
      an Inactive timer for an Inactive time interval.  Do not select
      these paths for the BGP bespath selection.

5.4.  Usage of BGP Aggregates

   Whenever a BGP speaker creates an aggregate route from more specific
   routes, it will not inherit any BGP SPEAKERID_PATH information from
   its more specific routes used for aggregation.  Instead, it will
   create its own SPEAKERID_PATH attribute when it announces the
   aggregate route to its BGP peers, i.e. the attribute will contain one
   segment with only its own (AS, router-id) pair when it announces the
   aggregate.

5.5.  BGP Confederation

   BGP Confederation Speaker peering with EBGP peers and receiving
   routes from them will exchange BGP Route Originator attributes as
   well.  Whenever a Special Withdrawal message is received, following
   is done:

   o  Remove the path announced by peer (sending a Special Withdrawal
      message).

   o  Not select any other BGP Paths with matching Route Originator
      Attribute (as one received in the Special Withdrawal).

   o  If there arent any alternate paths available, forward the Special
      Withdrawal message (with originate Route Originator Attribute).

5.6.  BGP Inactive Timer

   BGP inactive timer is used for suppressing path information from
   being used in BGP bestpath selection.  This prevents BGP from
   selecting such alternate paths for which withdrawals are not received
   yet.  A BGP speaker should remove suppress paths whenever withdrawn.
   A BGP speaker must subject all the suppress paths for BGP bestpath
   selection if they are not withdrawn even after inactive timer
   expires.  The timeout for an Inactive Timer should be kept big enough
   to allow the withdrawal information to propagate across the AS.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Authors would like to thank Robert Raszuk and Pedro Marques for their
   input.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA shall assign codepoints for the SPEAKERID_PATH and ROOT_CAUSE
   attributes.  These codepoints will come from the "BGP Path
   Attributes" registry.


8.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
