          Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers
                    draft-ietf-6man-default-iids-02

Abstract

   The IPv6 addressing architecture defines Modified EUI-64 format
   Interface Identifiers, and the existing IPv6 over various link-layers
   specify how such identifiers are derived from the underlying link-
   layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address) when employing IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  The security and
   privacy implications of embedding link-layer addresses in the
   Interface Identifier have been known and understood for some time
   now, and some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from
   such schemes to mitigate these issues.  This document changes the
   recommended default Interface Identifier generation scheme to that
   specified in RFC7217, and recommends against embedding link-layer
   addresses in IPv6 Interface Identifiers.  It formally updates
   RFC2464, RFC2467, RFC2470, RFC2491, RFC2492, RFC2497, RFC2590,
   RFC3146, RFC3572, RFC4291, RFC4338, RFC4391, RFC4944, RFC5072, and
   RFC5121, which require IPv6 Interface Identifiers to be derived from
   the underlying link-layer address.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a link-layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC
   address).

   In some network technologies and adaptation layers, the use of an
   Interface-ID based on a link-layer address may offer some advantages.
   For example, the IP-over-IEEE802.15.4 standard in [RFC6775] allows
   for compression of IPv6 addresses when the Interface-ID is based on
   the underlying link-layer address.

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a link-layer
   address in an IPv6 Interface ID have been known for some time now,

Internet-Draft            Default Interface-IDs             January 2015


   and are discussed in great detail in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy]; they include:

   o  Network activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

   Some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from the
   traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the
   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the aforementioned issues, this document recommends
   the implementation of an alternative scheme ([RFC7217]) as the
   default stable Interface-ID generation scheme, such that the
   aforementioned issues are mitigated.

   NOTE: [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" for Interface
   identifiers.  Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform
   an IEEE EUI-64 identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from
   which an EUI-64 identifier is derived, into an interface identifier
   in the Modified EUI-64 format.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers

   Nodes SHOULD implement and employ [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.  Link layers MUST define
   a mechanism that provides that mitigates the security and privacy
   implications discussed in Section 1.  A link layer MAY also define a
   mechanism that is more efficient and does not address the security
   and privacy considerations discussed in Section 1.  The choice of
   whether to enable privacy or not SHOULD be configurable in such a
   case.

Internet-Draft            Default Interface-IDs             January 2015


   Nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes that embed
   the underlying link-layer address in the Interface Identifier.  In
   particular, this document RECOMMENDS that nodes do not generate
   Interface Identifiers with the schemes specified in [RFC2464],
   [RFC2467], [RFC2470], [RFC2491], [RFC2492], [RFC2497], [RFC2590],
   [RFC3146], [RFC3572], [RFC4338], [RFC4391], [RFC4944], [RFC5121], and
   [RFC5072], and updates these documents with this recommendation.

   It is RECOMMENDED by this document that future specifications do not
   specify IPv6 address generation schemes that embed the underlying
   link-layer address in the Interface Identifier.  Future
   specifications MAY use a an IID based on a node's link-layer address
   if design and engineering considerations warrant.

4.  Future Work

   At the time of this writing, the mechanisms specified in the
   following documents are not compatible with the recommendations in
   this document:

   o  RFC 6282 [RFC6282]

   o  RFC 4944 [RFC4944]

   o  RFC 6755 [RFC6775]

   Future revisions or updates of these documents should take the issues
   of privacy and security mentioned in Section 1 1 and explain any
   design and engineering considerations that lead to the use of IIDs
   based on a node's link-layer address.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating IPv6 stable addresses with SLAAC, such that the security
   and privacy issues of Interface IDs that embed link-layer addresses
   are mitigated.
