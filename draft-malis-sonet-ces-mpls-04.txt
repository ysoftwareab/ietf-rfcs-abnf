3. Introduction 
    
   This document describes a method for encapsulating time division 
   multiplexed (TDM) digital signals for transmission over a packet-
   oriented MPLS network.  The transmission system for circuit-oriented 
   TDM signals is the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) [3], [6] / 
   Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) [4]. To support TDM traffic, 
   which includes voice, data, and private leased line service, the 
   MPLS network must emulate the circuit characteristics of SONET/SDH 
   payloads.  MPLS labels and a new circuit emulation header are used 
   to encapsulate TDM signals and provide the Circuit Emulation Service 
   over MPLS (CEM). 
    
   This document also describes an optional extension to CEM called 
   Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA).  This is a method for 
   dynamically reducing the bandwidth utilized by emulated SONET/SDH 
   circuits in the packet network.  This bandwidth reduction is 
   accomplished by not sending the SONET/SDH payload through the packet 
   network under certain conditions such as AIS-P or STS SPE 
   Unequipped. 
    
   This document is closely related to references [5], which describes 
   the control protocol methods used to signal the usage of CEM, and 
   [7], which describes a related method of encapsulating Layer 2 
   frames over MPLS and which shares the same signaling. 
    
    
4. Scope 
    
   This document describes how to provide CEM for the following digital 
   signals: 
    
   1. SONET STS-1 synchronous payload envelope (SPE)/SDH VC-3 
    
   2. STS-Nc SPE (N = 3, 12, or 48)/SDH VC-4, VC-4-4c, VC-4-16c 
    
   For the remainder of this document, these constructs will be 
   referred to as SONET/SDH channels.   
    
   Other SONET/SDH signals, such as virtual tributary (VT) structured 
   sub-rate mapping, are not explicitly discussed in this document; 
   however, it can be extended in the future to support VT and lower 
   speed non-SONET/SDH services. OC-192c SPE/VC-4-64c are also not 
   included at this point, since most MPLS networks use OC-192c or

   slower trunks, and thus would not have sufficient capacity.  As 
   trunk capacities increase in the future, the scope of this document 
   can be accordingly extended. 
    
5. CEM Encapsulation Format 
    
   In order to transport SONET/SDH SPEs through a packet-oriented 
   network, the SPE is broken into fragments.  A 32-bit CEM Header is 
   pre-pended to each fragment.  The Basic CEM packet appears in Figure 
   1.

   The above fields are defined as follows: 
    
   D bit: Signals DBA Mode.  MUST be set to zero for Normal Operation.  
   MUST be set to one if CEM is currently in DBA mode.  DBA is an 
   optional mode during which trivial SPEs are not transmitted into the 
   packet network.  See Table 1 and sections 7 and 8 for further 
   details. 
    
   Reserved: These bits are reserved for future use, and MUST be set to 
   zero. 
    
   Sequence Number:  This is a packet sequence number, which MUST 
   continuously cycle from 0 to 1023.  It SHOULD begin at zero when a 
   CEM LSP is created. 
    
   Structure Pointer: The Structure Pointer MUST contain the offset of 
   the J1 byte within the CEM payload. The value is from 0 to 1,022, 
   where 0 means the first byte after the CEM header. The Structure

   Pointer MUST be set to 0x3FF (1,023) if a packet does not carry the 
   J1 byte.  See [3], [4] and [6] for more information on the J1 byte 
   and the SONET/SDH payload pointer. 
    
   The N and P bits: Indicate negative and positive pointer adjustment 
   events.  They are also used to relay SONET/SDH maintenance signals 
   such as AIS-P.  See Table 1 and sections 7 and 8 for more details.

   ECC-6: An Error Correction Code to protect the CEM header.  This 
   offers the ability to correct single bit errors and detect up to two 
   bit errors.  The ECC algorithm is described in Appendix B. 
    
   Note: CEM packets are fixed in length for all of the packets of a 
   particular emulated TDM stream.  This length is signaled using the 
   CEM Payload Bytes parameter defined in [5], or is statically 
   provisioned for each TDM stream.  Therefore, the length of each CEM 
   packet does not need to be carried in the CEM header. 
    
5.1 Transport Encapsulation 
    
   In principle, CEM packets can be transported over any packet-
   oriented network.  The following sections describe specifically how 
   CEM packets MUST be encapsulated for transport over MPLS or IP 
   networks. 
    
5.1.1 MPLS Transport 
    
   To transport a CEM packet over an MPLS network, an MPLS label-stack 
   MUST be pushed on top of the CEM packet. 
    
   The last two labels prior to the CEM header are referred to as the 
   Tunnel and VC labels.   
    
   The VC label is required, and is the last label prior to the CEM 
   Header.  The VC label MUST be used to identify the CEM connection 
   within the MPLS tunnel.

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS      April 2001 
 
 
   The optional tunnel label is immediately above the VC label on the 
   label stack.  If present, the tunnel label MUST be used to identify 
   the MPLS LSP used to tunnel the TDM packets through the MPLS network 
   (the tunnel LSP).   
    
   This is similar to the label stack usage defined in [5] and [7].

5.1.1 IP Transport 
    
   It is highly desirable to define a single encapsulation format that 
   will work for both IP and MPLS.  Furthermore, it is desirable that 
   the encapsulation mechanism be as efficient as possible.   
    
   One way to achieve these goals is to map CEM directly onto IP by 
   mapping the previously described MPLS packets onto IP. 
    
   A mechanism for carrying MPLS over IP is described in [8].

   Using this encapsulation scheme would result in the packet format 
   illustrated in figure 4.

6. CEM Operation 
    
   The following sections describe CEM operation.   
    
6.1 Introduction and Terminology 
 
   CEM MUST support a normal mode of operation and MAY support an 
   optional extension called Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA).  
   During normal operation, SONET/SDH payloads are fragmented, pre-
   pended with the CEM Header and the MPLS label-stack, and then 
   transmitted into the packet network.  During DBA mode, only the CEM 
   header and MPLS label stack are transmitted.  This is done to 
   conserve bandwidth when meaningful user data is not present in the 
   SPE, such as during AIS-P or STS SPE Unequipped.   
    
6.1.1 CEM Packetizer and De-Packetizer 
 
   As with all adaptation functions, CEM has two distinct components: 
   adapting TDM SONET/SDH into a CEM packet stream, and converting the 
   CEM packet stream back into a TDM SONET/SDH.  The first function 
   will be referred to as CEM Packetizer and the second as CEM De-
   Packetizer.  This terminology is illustrated in figure 5. 
    
    
             +------------+              +---------------+                         
             |            |              |               | 
   SONET --> |    CEM     | --> MPLS --> |      CEM      | --> SONET  
    SDH      | Packetizer |              | De-Packetizer |      SDH 
             |            |              |               |        
             +------------+              +---------------+ 
    
   Figure 5. CEM Terminology 
    
   Note: the CEM receive function requires a buffering mechanism to 
   account for delay variation in the CEM packet stream.  This 
   buffering mechanism will be generically referred to as the CEM  
   jitter buffer. 
    
6.1.2 CEM DBA 
    
   CEM DBA is an optional mode of operation that only transmits the CEM 
   Header and MPLS Label Stack into the packet network under certain 
   circumstances such as AIS-P or STS Unequipped.   
    
   If DBA is supported by a CEM implementation, the user SHOULD be able 
   to configure if DBA will be triggered by AIS-P, STS Unequipped, 
   both, or neither on a per channel basis.   
    
   If DBA is supported, the determination of AIS-P and STS Unequipped 
   MUST be based on the state of SONET/SDH Section, Line, and Path 
   Overhead bytes.  DBA based on pattern detection within the SPE (i.e. 
   all zeros, 7Es, or ATM idle cells) is for further study. 
  
Malis, et al.            Expires October 2001                 [Page 7] 

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS      April 2001 
 
 
    
   During AIS-P, there is no valid payload pointer, so pointer 
   adjustments cannot occur.  During STS Unequipped, the SONET/SDH 
   payload pointer is valid, and therefore pointer adjustments MUST be 
   supported even during DBA.  See Table 1 for details. 
    
6.2 Description of Normal CEM Operation 
    
   During normal operation, the CEM packetizer will receive a fixed 
   rate byte stream from a SONET/SDH interface.  When a packets worth 
   of data has been received from a SONET/SDH channel, the CEM Header 
   and MPLS label stack are pre-pended to the SPE fragment and the 
   resulting CEM packet is transmitted into the MPLS network.  Because 
   all CEM packets associated with a specific SONET/SDH channel will 
   have the same length, the transmission of CEM packets for that 
   channel SHOULD occur at regular intervals.   
    
   At the far end of the packet network, the CEM de-packetizer will 
   receive packets into a jitter buffer and then play out the received 
   byte stream at a fixed rate onto the corresponding SONET/SDH 
   channel.  The jitter buffer SHOULD be adjustable in length to 
   account for varying network delay behavior.  The receive packet rate 
   from the packet network should be exactly balanced by the 
   transmission rate onto the SONET/SDH channel, on average.  The time 
   over which this average is taken corresponds to the depth of the 
   jitter buffer for a specific CEM channel. 
    
6.3 Description of CEM Operation during DBA 
    
   There are several issues that should be addressed by a workable CEM 
   DBA mechanism.  First, when DBA is invoked, there should be a 
   substantial savings in bandwidth utilization in the packet network.  
   The second issue is that the transition in and out of DBA should be 
   tightly coordinated between the local CEM packetizer and CEM de-
   packetizer at the far side of the packet network.  A third is that 
   the transition in and out of DBA should be accomplished with minimal 
   disruption to the adapted data stream. 
    
   Another goal is that the reduction of CEM traffic due to DBA should 
   not be mistaken for a fault in the packet network or vice-versa.  
   Finally, the implementation of DBA should require minimal 
   modifications beyond what is necessary for the nominal CEM case.  
   The mechanism described below is a reasonable balance of these 
   goals. 
    
   During DBA, packets MUST be emitted at exactly the same rate as they 
   would be during normal operation.  This SHOULD be accomplished by 
   transmitting each DBA packet after a complete packet of data has 
   been received from the SONET/SDH channel.  The only change from 
   normal operation is that the CEM packets during DBA MUST only carry 
   the CEM header and the MPLS label stack.  The D-bit MUST be set to 
   one, to indicate that DBA is active.

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS      April 2001 
 
 
   The CEM de-packetizer MUST assume that each packet received with the 
   D-bit set represents a normal-sized packet containing an AIS-P or 
   SPE Unequipped payload as noted by N and P.  See Table 1.   
    
   This allows the CEM packetization and de-packetization logic during 
   DBA to be virtually identical to the nominal case.  It insures that 
   the correct SONET/SDH indication is reliably transmitted between CEM 
   adaptation points.  It minimizes the risk of under or over running 
   the jitter buffer during the transition in and out of DBA.  And, it 
   guarantees that faults in the packet network are recognized as 
   distinctly different from line conditioning on the SONET/SDH 
   interfaces. 
    
7. SONET/SDH Maintenance Signals 
    
   There are several issues that must be considered in the mapping of 
   maintenance signals between SONET/SDH and MPLS.  A description of 
   how these signals and conditions are mapped between the two domains 
   is described below. 
    
   For clarity, the mappings are split into two groups: SONET/SDH to 
   MPLS, and MPLS to SONET/SDH.  
    
7.1 SONET/SDH to MPLS 
   The following sections describe how SONET/SDH Maintenance Signals 
   and Alarm conditions are mapped into MPLS.   
    
7.1.1 AIS-P Indication 
    
   In a SONET/SDH network, circuit outages are signaled using 
   maintenance alarms such as Path AIS (AIS-P).  In particular, AIS-P 
   indicates that the SONET/SDH Path is not currently transmitting 
   valid end-user data, and the SPE contains all ones.   
    
   It should be noted that nearly every type of service-effecting 
   section or line defect will result in an AIS-P condition. 
   The SONET/SDH hierarchy is illustrated below.

   Should the Section Layer detect a Loss of Section (LOS) or Loss of 
   Frame (LOF) condition, it sends AIS-L up to the Line Layer.  If the 
   Line Layer detects AIS-L or Loss of Path (LOP), it sends AIS-P to 
   the Path Layer.   
    
   In normal mode during AIS-P, CEM packets are generated as usual.  
   The N and P bits MUST be set to 11 binary to signal AIS-P explicitly 
   through the packet network.  The D-bit MUST be set to zero to 
   indicate that the SPE is being carried through the packet network.  
   Normal CEM packets with the SPE fragment, CEM Header, and MPLS label 
   stack MUST be transmitted into the packet network. 
    
   However, to conserve network bandwidth during AIS-P, DBA MAY be 
   employed.  If DBA has been enabled for AIS-P and AIS-P is currently 
   occurring, the N and P bits MUST be set to 11 binary to signal AIS, 
   and the D-bit MUST be set to one to indicate that the SPE is not 
   being carried through the packet network.  Only the CEM header and 
   the MPLS label stack MUST be transmitted into the packet network. 
    
   Also note that this differs from the outage mechanism in [5], which 
   withdraws labels as a result of an endpoint outage.  TDM circuit 
   emulation requires the ability to distinguish between the de-
   provisioning of a circuit, which would cause the labels to be 
   withdrawn, and temporary outages, which are signaled using AIS-P.

7.1.2 STS SPE Unequipped Indication 
    
   The STS SPE Unequipped Indication is a slightly different case than 
   AIS-P.  When byte C2 of the Path Overhead (STS path signal label) is 
   00h and Byte B3 (STS Path BIP-8) is valid, it indicates that the SPE 
   is unequipped.  Note: this is typically signaled by setting the 
   entire SPE to zeros. 
    
   For normal operation during SPE Unequipped, the N and P bits MUST be 
   interpreted as usual.  The SPE MUST be transmitted into the packet 
   network along with the CEM Header and MPLS label stack, and the D-
   Bit MUST be set to zero.  
    
   If DBA has been enabled for STS SPE Unequipped and the Unequipped is 
   occurring on the SONET/SDH channel, the D-bit MUST be set to one to 
   indicate DBA is active.  Only the CEM Header and MPLS Label Stack 
   must be transmitted into the packet network.  The N and P bits MUST 
   be used to signal pointer adjustments as normal.  See Table 1 and 
   section 8 for details. 
 
7.1.3 RDI-P Indication 
 
   The CEM function MUST send RDI-P towards the packet network under a 
   variety of network errors such as loss of packet synchronization.  
   This MUST be accomplished by modifying the SONET/SDH Path Overhead 
   within the CEM packets.  Specifically the G1 byte must be updated to 
   signal RDI-P and the B3 (Path BIP-8) must be re-computed.  See [3], 
   [4], and [6] for details. 
    
7.2 MPLS to SONET/SDH 
 
   The following sections discuss how the various conditions on the 
   packet network are converted into SONET/SDH indications. 
    
7.2.1 AIS-P Indication 
 
   There are several conditions in the packet network that will cause 
   the CEM de-packetization function to send an AIS-P indication onto a 
   SONET/SDH channel.   
    
   The first of these is the receipt of CEM packets with the N and P 
   bits set to one, and the D-bit set to zero.  This is an explicit 
   indication of AIS-P being received at the far-end of the packet 
   network, with DBA disabled for AIS-P.  The CEM de-packetizer MUST 
   play out the received SPE fragment (which will incidentally be 
   carrying all ones), and MUST configure the SONET/SDH Overhead to 
   signal AIS-P as defined in [3], [4], and [6]. 
    
   The second case is the receipt of CEM packets with the N and P bits 
   set to one, and the D-bit set to one.  This is an explicit 
   indication of AIS-P being received at the far-end of the packet 
   network, with DBA enabled for AIS-P.  The CEM de-packetizer MUST 
   play out one packetÆs worth of all ones for each packet received,

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS      April 2001 
 
 
   and MUST configure the SONET/SDH Overhead to signal AIS-P as defined 
   in [3], [4], and [6]. 
    
   Additional conditions that SHOULD trigger the transmission of AIS-P 
   onto a SONET/SDH channel include loss of packet synchronization and 
   jitter buffer under-run.  The definition of these conditions are 
   under investigation and will be clarified in a subsequent revision 
   of this draft.   
    
7.2.2 STS SPE Unequipped Indication 
 
   There are two conditions in the packet network that will cause the 
   CEM function to transmit STS SPE Unequipped indications onto the 
   SONET/SDH channel.  
    
   The first, which is transparent to CEM, is the receipt of regular 
   CEM packets that happen to be carrying an SPE that contains the 
   appropriate Path overhead to signal STS SPE unequipped.  This case 
   does not require any special processing on the part of the CEM de-
   packetizer. 
    
   The second case is the receipt of CEM packets that have the D-bit 
   set to one to indicate DBA active and the N and P bits set to 00 
   binary, 01 binary, or 10 binary to indicate SPE Unequipped with or 
   without pointer adjustments.  The CEM de-packetizer MUST use this 
   information to transmit a packet of all zeros onto the SONET/SDH 
   interface, and adjust the payload pointer as necessary. 
    
7.2.3 RDI-P Indication 
 
   The CEM function MUST send an RDI-P towards a SONET/SDH channel 
   under the conditions defined for SONET/SDH Line Terminating 
   equipment in [3], [4], and [6].   
 
8. Clocking Modes 
    
   It is necessary to be able to regenerate the input service clock at 
   the output interface.  Two clocking modes are supported: synchronous 
   and asynchronous. 
    
8.1 Synchronous 
    
   When synchronous SONET/SDH timing is available at both ends of the 
   circuit, the N and P bits are used to signal negative or positive 
   pointer justification events.  
    
   If there is a frequency offset between the frame rate of the 
   transport overhead and that of the SONET/SDH SPE, then the alignment 
   of the SPE shall periodically slip back or advance in time through 
   positive or negative stuffing. The N and P bits are used to replay 
   the stuff indicators and eliminate transport jitter. 
    

  
Malis, et al.            Expires October 2001                [Page 12] 

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS      April 2001 
 
 
   The pointer adjustment event MUST be transmitted in three 
   consecutive packets by the packetizer. The de-packetizer MUST play 
   out the pointer adjustment event when any one packet with N/P bit 
   set is received.   
    
   Furthermore, it is possible for pointer adjustments to occur in back 
   to back SONET/SDH frames.  In order to support this possibility, the 
   packet size for a particular circuit MUST be no larger than 
   (783*N)/3.  Where N is the STS-Nc multiplier.   
    
   Since the minimum value of N is one, all CEM implementations MUST 
   support a minimum payload length of 783/3 or 261 bytes.  Smaller 
   payload lengths MAY be supported as an option. 
    
   The CEM de-packetizer MUST utilize the CEM sequence numbers to 
   insure that SONET/SDH pointer adjustment events are not played any 
   more frequently than once per every three CEM packets transmitted by 
   the remote CEM packetizer.   
    
   If both bits are set, then an AIS-P event has occurred (this is 
   further discussed in section 7).   
    
   When DBA is invoked (i.e. the D-bit = 1), N and P have additional 
   meanings.  See Table 1 and section 7. 
    
8.2 Asynchronous 
    
   If synchronous timing is not available, the N and P bits are not 
   used for frequency justification and adaptive methods are used to 
   recover the timing. The N and P bits are only used for the 
   occurrence of a path AIS event. An example adaptive method can be 
   found in section 3.4.2 of [9]. 
 
 
9. CEM LSP Signaling 
    
   For maximum network scaling, CEM LSP signaling may be performed 
   using the LDP Extended Discovery mechanism as augmented by the VC 
   FEC Element defined in [5].  MPLS traffic tunnels may be dedicated 
   to CEM, or shared with other MPLS-based services.  The value 8008 is 
   used for the VC Type in the VC FEC Element in order to signify that 
   the LSP being signaled is to carry CEM.  Note that the generic 
   control word defined in [6] is not used, as its functionality is 
   included in the CEM encapsulation header. 
    
   Alternatively, static label assignment may be used, or a dedicated 
   traffic engineered LSP may be used for each CEM circuit. 
    
   CEM packets are fixed in length for all of the packets of a 
   particular emulated TDM stream.  This length is signaled using the 
   CEM Payload Bytes parameter defined in [5], or is statically 
   provisioned for each TDM stream.

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS      April 2001 
 
 
   The use of DBA is signaled by the use of the CEM Options parameter 
   defined in [5], or is statically provisioned for each TDM stream. 
    
10. Open Issues 
    
   Future revisions of this document may discuss the following items. 
    
   Underlying MPLS QoS requirements are not covered by this revision of 
   the draft.  Future revisions may discuss underlying QoS 
   requirements. 
    
   Support for VT and lower speed non-SONET/SDH services are not 
   covered in this revision of the draft.  Future revisions may address 
   VT and non-SONET/SDH TDM services. 
    
   The current draft only considers DBA based on SONET/SDH Overhead.  
   It would be very desirable to extending DBA to include pattern-based 
   suppression such as long runs of HDLC flags (i.e. 0x7E).  One issue 
   that complicates pattern-based DBA is that the path overhead appears 
   every Nx87 bytes within the SPE.  One solution may be to have a 
   special mode of DBA, where the Path Overhead is explicitly 
   transported within the packet along with the specific pattern (e.g. 
   7E). 
    
   This revision of the draft does not provide a definition for æloss 
   of packet synchronizationÆ or æjitter buffer under-runÆ.  Details 
   for declaring these conditions at the de-packetizer will be 
   addressed in future revisions.   
    
11. Security Considerations 
    
   As with [5], this document does not affect the underlying security 
   issues of MPLS.

   Appendix A. SONET/SDH Rates and Formats 
    
   For simplicity, the discussion in this section uses SONET 
   terminology, but it applies equally to SDH as well.  SDH-equivalent 
   terminology is shown in the tables. 
    
   The basic SONET modular signal is the synchronous transport signal-
   level 1 (STS-1). A number of STS-1s may be multiplexed into higher-
   level signals denoted as STS-N, with N synchronous payload envelopes 
   (SPEs). The optical counterpart of the STS-N is the Optical Carrier-
   level N, or OC-N. Table 2 lists standard SONET line rates discussed 
   in this document. 
    
    
     OC Level          OC-1    OC-3    OC-12      OC-48     OC-192 
     SDH Term             -   STM-1    STM-4     STM-16     STM-64 
     Line Rate(Mb/s) 51.840 155.520  622.080  2,488.320  9,953.280 
    
                    Table 2. Standard SONET Line Rates 
    
    
   Each SONET frame is 125 ´s and consists of nine rows. An STS-N frame 
   has nine rows and N*90 columns. Of the N*90 columns, the first N*3 
   columns are transport overhead and the other N*87 columns are SPEs. 
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate 
   signal with only one SPE. The optical super-rate signal is denoted 
   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N. 
    
   The first 9-byte column of each SPE is the path overhead (POH) and 
   the remaining columns form the payload capacity with fixed stuff 
   (STS-Nc only).  The fixed stuff, which is purely overhead, is N/3-1 
   columns for STS-Nc.  Thus, STS-1 and STS-3c do not have any fixed 
   stuff, STS-12c has three columns of fixed stuff, and so on. 
    
   The POH of an STS-1 or STS-Nc is always nine bytes in nine rows. The 
   payload capacity of an STS-1 is 86 columns (774 bytes) per frame. 
   The payload capacity of an STS-Nc is (N*87)-(N/3) columns per frame.  
   Thus, the payload capacity of an STS-3c is (3*87 - 1)*9 = 2,340 
   bytes per frame. As another example, the payload capacity of an STS-
   192c is 149,760 bytes, which is exactly 64 times larger than the 
   STS-3c. 
    
   There are 8,000 SONET frames per second. Therefore, the SPE size, 
   (POH plus payload capacity) of an STS-1 is 783*8*8,000 = 50.112 
   Mb/s. The SPE size of a concatenated STS-3c is 2,349 bytes per frame 
   or 150.336 Mb/s. The payload capacity of an STS-192c is 149,760 
   bytes per frame, which is equivalent to 9,584.640 Mb/s. Table 2 
   lists the SPE and payload rates supported.

Appendix B. ECC-6 Definition 
    
   ECC-6 is an Error Correction Code to protect the CEM header.  This 
   provides single bit correction and the ability to detect up to two 
   bit errors.

                      Figure 7. ECC-6 Check Matrix X 
    
    
   The ECC-6 code protects the 32 bit CEM header as follows: 
    
   The encoder generates the 6 bit ECC using the matrix shown in Figure 
   7.  In brief, the encoder builds another 26 column by 6 row matrix 
   and calculates even parity over the rows.  The matrix columns 
   represent CEM header bits 0 through 25. 
    
   Denote each column of the ECC-6 check matrix by X[], and each column 
   of the intermediate encoder matrix as Y[].  CEM[] denotes the CEM 
   header and ECC[] is the error correction code that is inserted into 
   CEM header bits 26 through 31.

   for i = 0 to 25 { 
        if CEM[i] = 0 { 
                Y[i] = 0; 
        } else {         
                Y[i] = X[i]; 
        } 
   } 
    
   In other words, for each CEM header bit (i) set to 1, set the 
   resulting matrix column Y[i] according to Figure 7. 
    
   The final ECC-6 code is calculated as even parity of each row in Y 
   (i.e. ECC[k]=CEM[25+k]=even parity of row k). 
    
   The receiver also uses matrix X to calculate an intermediate matrix 
   YÆ based on all 32 bits of the CEM header.  Therefore YÆ is 32 
   columns wide and includes the ECC-6 code. 
    
   for i = 0 to 31 { 
        if CEM[i] = 0 { 
                YÆ[i] = 0; 
        } else {         
                YÆ[i] = X[i]; 
        } 
   } 
 
   The receiver then appends the incoming ECC-6 code to Y as column 32 
   (ECC[0] should align with row 0) and calculates even parity for each 
   row.  The result is a single 6 bit column Z.  If all 6 bits are 0, 
   there are no bit errors (or at least no detectable errors).  
   Otherwise, it uses Z to perform a reverse lookup on X[] from Figure 
   7.  If Z matches column X[i], then there is a single bit error.  The 
   receiver should invert bit CEM[i] to correct the header.  If Z fails 
   to match any column of X, then the CEM header contains more than one 
   bit error and the CEM packet MUST be discarded. 
    
   Note that the ECC-6 code provides single bit correction and 2-bit 
   detection of errors within the received ECC-6 code itself
