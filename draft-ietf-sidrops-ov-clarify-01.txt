                    draft-ietf-sidrops-ov-clarify-01

Abstract

   Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered by, among
   other things, vendor mis-implementations in two critical areas, which
   routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified
   by configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible
   misunderstandings causing those mis-implementations.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC8174] only when they appear in all
   upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed case as English
   words, without normative meaning.

1.  Introduction

   Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered by, among
   other things, vendor mis-implementations in two critical areas, which
   routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified
   by configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible
   misunderstandings causing those mis-implementations.

   When a route is distributed into BGP, origin validation marks the
   announcement as NotFound, Valid, or Invalid per [RFC6811].
   Operational testing has shown that the specifications of that RFC
   were not sufficient to avoid divergent implementations.  This
   document attempts to clarify two areas seeming to cause confusion.

   The implementation issues seem not to be about how to validate, i.e.,
   how to decide if a route is NotFound, Valid, or Invalid.  The issues
   seem to be which routes to mark and whether to apply policy without
   operator configuration.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI,
   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), [RFC6482], and RPKI-
   based Prefix Validation, [RFC6811].

3.  Mark ALL Prefixes

   A router SHOULD validate and mark all routes in its BGP, no matter
   how received.  Otherwise the operator does not have the ability to
   drop Invalid routes; and is therefore liable to complaints from
   neighbors about propagation of invalid routes.  For this reason,
   [RFC6811] says

   "When a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE from a neighbor, it SHOULD
   perform a lookup as described above for each of the Routes in the
   UPDATE message.  The lookup SHOULD also be applied to routes that are
   redistributed into BGP from another source, such as another protocol
   or a locally defined static route."

   [RFC6811] goes on to say "An implementation MAY provide configuration
   options to control which routes the lookup is applied to."

   Significant Clarification: In the absence of the operator applying
   such policy, ALL routes in BGP MUST be marked.

   This means that, on a router, all routes in BGP, absent operator
   configuration otherwise, MUST have been marked because they were
   either received via BGP (whether eBGP or iBGP), redistributed from an
   IGP, static, or directly connected, or any other distribution into
   BGP.

   When redistributing into BGP from connected, static, IGP, iBGP, etc.,
   there is no AS_PATH in the input to allow RPKI validation of the
   originating AS.  In such cases, the router SHOULD use the AS of the
   router's BGP configuration.  If that is ambiguous because of
   confederation, AS migration, or other multi-AS configuration, then
   the router configuration MUST provide a means of specifying the AS to
   be used on the redistribution, either per redistribution or globally.

4.  Marking not Acting

   Significant Clarification: Once routes are marked, the operator
   should be in complete control of any policy applied based the
   markings.  Absent operator configuration, policy MUST NOT be applied.

   Automatic origin validation policy actions such as those described in
   [RFC8097], BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community,
   MUST NOT be carried out or otherwise applied unless specifically
   configured by the operator.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create security considerations beyond those of
   [RFC6811].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.

7.  Acknowledgments

   Many thanks to John Scudder who had the patience to give constructive
   review multiple times, and to Keyur Patel who noted that the AS might
   have to be specified.  George Michaelson, Jay Borkenhagen, John
   Heasley, and Matthias Waehlisch kindly helped clean up loose wording.
