Internet-Draft            Location Enumservice                  Jun 2008


1.  Introduction

   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [RFC3761] uses the Domain Name System
   (DNS) [RFC1035] to refer from E.164 numbers [refs.E164] to Uniform
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986].  Specific services to be used
   with ENUM must be registered with IANA.

   HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] specifies a Layer 7
   location configuration protocol for retrieving location information
   from a server.  The URI scheme 'helds' is specified to identify
   resources on such a location server.

   [I-D.mayrhofer-geopriv-geo-uri] specifies the 'geo' URI scheme to
   identify a physical location by its latitude, longitude and
   optionally altitude in a compact, simple, human-readable, and
   protocol independent way.

   The 'loc' Enumservice proposed in this document refers from a E.164
   number to an URI identifying the physical location of the respective
   number, identified by 'helds' or 'geo' URIs resulting from the
   processing of the respective ENUM record.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Enumservice Registration - 'loc'

   The following template contains information required for the IANA
   registrations of the 'loc' Enumservice, according to
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

4.1.  Registration for 'loc:helds'

   Enumservice Class: Application-type, Common

   Enumservice Type: "loc"

   Enumservice Subtype: "helds"

   URI Scheme(s): "helds"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a HELD
      resource, which can be dereferenced to retrieve the location of
      the respective E.164 number.  Clients should expect access to the
      HELD resource to be restricted, and should also be prepared for
      the server to return different granularity of information, based
      on for example the identity of the client.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Registration Document(s): [RFC XXXX] (replace with RFC number of this
   document once assigned)

   Author(s): Alexander Mayrhofer

   Further Information: N/A

4.2.  Registration for 'loc:geo'

   Enumservice Class: Application-type, Common

   Enumservice Type: "loc"

   Enumservice Subtype: "geo"

   URI Scheme(s): "geo"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is an
      'geo' URI, which in turn identifies the physical location of the
      respective E.164 number.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Registration Document(s): [RFC XXXX] (replace with RFC number of this
   document once assigned)

   Author(s): Alexander Mayrhofer

   Further Information: N/A


5.  Examples

   An example ENUM entry identifying the location of a number using a
   HELD resource could look like this:

   $ORIGIN 6.9.4.0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @  IN NAPTR  (
         100 10 "u"
         "E2U+loc:helds"
         "!^.*$!helds://nottinghamshire.example.com/sherwood/robin72!" .
      )

   A client who retrieves that ENUM record would then try to dereference
   the resulting HELD resource, with the location server returning the
   desired location information if the client is authorized to do so.
   The location server could, for example, return only rough location
   for anonymous clients, while trusted clients receive full location
   data.

   An example ENUM entry referring to a location of a number using a
   'geo' URI could look like this:

      $ORIGIN 6.9.4.0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
      @  IN NAPTR  (
            100 10 "u"
            "E2U+loc:geo"
            "!^.*$!geo:53.204628,-1.072359!" .
         )

   The client could use the geographical coordinates contained in the
   URI to display a map of the current user's location.  Note that the
   location information is contained in the URI (and therefore in the
   ENUM record) itself, which makes it unnecessary to contact a location
   server.  However, it is therefore not be possible to return different
   location information to different clients.


6.  Security & Privacy Considerations

   General security considerations of the protocols on which this

Internet-Draft            Location Enumservice                  Jun 2008


   Enumservice registration is based are addressed in Sections 3.1.3 and
   6 of RFC 3761 (ENUM).

   Since ENUM uses DNS - a publicly available database - any information
   contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains must be considered
   public as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and removing the
   refered resource, copies of the information could still be available.

   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
   between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if IRIs/URIs
   contain personal identifiers or domain names for which ownership
   information can be obtained easily.

   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not
   need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a
   location where access to personal information could be granted.

   ENUM records pointing to third party resources can easily be
   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
   about the association between a number and an entity could therefore
   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification is in
   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests IANA to add a new "loc" Enumservice to the
   'Enumservice Registrations' registry, according to the definitions in
   this document and RFC 3761 [RFC3761].

   The required templates are contained in Section 4.


8.  DNS Considerations

   The proposed Enumservice does not require any special DNS
   considerations.  While 'geo' URIs can be dereferenced even without
   subsequent DNS lookups, a 'helds' URI may require additional DNS
   queries to resolve the server location.  However, such queries can
   never end up in another ENUM query, hence the probability of endless
   loops is zero.
