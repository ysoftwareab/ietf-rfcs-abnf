   The Accept-Measurement, Send-Measurement headers are optional.  If a
   negotiation is successful, the Timing-Measures header is required.
   The Timing-Measures-Collector header is optional.  All measurement
   values, as well as TI, are 32-bit integers expressed as milliseconds.
   The collector-url is a string representing the URI data should be
   sent back to.

   Measurements are submitted via an HTTP POST request and must contain
   the Timing-Measures header, and should not contain any data in the
   body of the request.  Measurements are sent as key-value pairs in the
   form of measurement:value delimited by semicolons.  If the Timing-
   Measures-Collector header is sent or the relevant HTML meta tag
   exists, the client must send its data to the specified collector-url
   in the body of a POST request, using the data format specified above.

   The user agent must discard the measurements after the Timing
   Interval for the requested metrics expires.
