1. Introduction 

   In traditional transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are 
   provisioned on multiple switches, and service providers should be 
   able to monitor the performance of such circuits for management 
   purpose. For example, when performance of a primary circuit degrades 
   backup circuit may be activated. An MPLS-TP bidirectional LSPs 
   emulate the traditional transport circuits and hence should provide 
   the same performance measurement capability. In this document, an 
   MPLS-TP LSP means either an MPLS transport LSP or an MPLS Pseudowire 
   (PW). 
    
   This document specifies an MPLS-TP LSP performance monitoring scheme 
   that is based on two new types of MPLS-OAM packets called "MPLS-OAM 
   Performance Control(PC)" and "MPLS-OAM Performance Flow(PF)". These 
   packets are sent at a rate that is acceptable to both sender and 
   receiver. The MPLS-OAM PC packets are used to setup an MPLS-TP LSP 
   for performance monitoring, and the MPLS-OAM PF packets are used as 
   the probes for collecting performance data.  

   Performance can be monitored using one of the two following modes:

     On-Demand: An MPLS-TP LSP's performance is monitored only based on 
     operator request, i.e., performance is not monitored automatically 
     as soon as the LSP becomes operational. 

     Continuous: In this mode, it is assumed that an MPLS-TP LSP is 
     configured for continuous performance monitoring. Also, the 
     relevant configuration can be applied to and removed from an MPLS-
     TP LSP at any time during the life of the LSP. When configured for 
     continuous performance monitoring, an MPLS-TP LSP's performance is 
     continuously monitored as soon as it becomes operational. 

   The following features are common to both the on-demand and the 
   continuous modes:  

   1. The LSP can be optionally locked for data traffic. 

   2. MPLS-OAM PC and PF packets can be consumed by either a Maintenance 
     Intermediate Point (MIP) or a Maintenance End Point (MEP). 

   3. MPLS-OAM PC and PF packets are intercepted at any MIP based on 
     MPLS TTL expiry, and are intercepted at MEP simply because it is 
     the egress LSR of the LSP (i.e., regardless of the TTL value). 

   4. More than one MPLS-OAM performance flows can be maintained 
     simultaneously from a MEP to any MIP or the other MEP. 

   5. The transmission rate of MPLS-OAM PF packets MUST be acceptable to 
     both the sender and the receiver, otherwise transmission of such 
     packets MUST NOT begin. The rate is negotiated via MPLS-OAM PC 
     packets.  

   6. An MPLS OAM PF packets contains sequence number and time-stamp to 
     measure packet loss and unidirectional delay/jitter. 

   In the continuous mode, the MEP at which performance is monitored is 
   configured to send MPLS-OAM PF packets continuously to different MIPs 
   and/or the other MEP. The configuration specifies: 

   . Rate at which the MPLS-OAM PF packets are sent. 

   . Addresses of MIPs/MEP to which the MPLS-OAM PF packets are 
     destined. 

   . Whether or not performance is monitored in both directions of the 
     MPLS-TP LSP.

Internet-Draft draft-boutros-mpls-tp-performance-01.txt      March 2009 
    

   . Rate at which the number of lost MPLS-OAM PF packets should be 
     reported to the sender MEP. 

   The proposed mechanism is based on a set of new TLVs which can be 
   transported using one of the following methods: 

       1. Using in-band MPLS OAM messages which are forwarded as MPLS 
          packets (non-IP based). 

       2. Using in-band LSP-Ping extensions defined in [3] where IP/UDP 
          packets are used (IP-based). The LSP-Ping messages are sent 
          using the codepoint defined in [2]. 

   Method (1) and (2) are referred to as "Non-IP option" and "LSP-Ping 
   option" respectively in the rest of the document. 

   Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

3. MPLS-TP Performance Monitor Mechanism 

   For the Non-IP option, the proposed mechanism uses two new code 
   points in the Associated Channel Header (ACH) described in [6]. The 
   LSP-Ping option is in compliance to the specifications [2],[3], and 
   [7]. 

   The proposed mechanism requires a set of new TLVs called Performance 
   Request TLV, Performance Loss Report TLV.  

   In addition, the proposed mechanism uses the Address and LSPI TLVs 
   defined in [5]. Moreover, it can also be used in conjunction with the 
   data-locking mechanism defined in [4]. 

   The new TLVs are described below. 

4. MPLS-OAM Performance Message 

4.1. In-band Message Identification 

   In the in-band option, under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-TP LSP, the   
   ACH with "MPLS-TP Performance Control" code point indicates that the 
   message is an MPLS OAM Performance Control (PC) message. The ACH with 
   code point "MPLS-TP Performance Flow" indicates that the message is 
   an MPLS OAM Performance Flow (PF) message.

   The first nibble (0001b) indicates the ACH.  The version and the   
   reserved values are both set to 0 as specified in [1].  MPLS-TP   
   Performance control and performance flow code points = 0xHH and 0xhh. 
   [HH and hh to be assigned by IANA from the PW Associated Channel Type 
   registry.]

   Two operations are defined as shown below. In the unidirectional 
   mode, the receiver MIP or MEP does not have to maintain a PM flow 
   towards the sender MEP. But, in the bidirectional mode, the receiver 
   MIP or MEP MUST maintain a PM flow towards the sender MEP. 

   Operation        Description 
   ---------        ------------- 
   0x0              Unidirectional 
   0x1              Bidirectional 

   Sender's Handle 
   The Sender's Handle is filled in by the sender. There are no 
   semantics associated with this handle. 

   Message Length 
   The total length of any included TLVs. 

   Message ID 
   The Message ID is set by the sender and is incremented everytime the 
   sender sends a new message. The receiver MUST include the Message ID 
   in the response. This way, the sender can correlate a reply with the 
   corresponding request.

   Note that the MPLS-TP LSP whose performance is to be monitored is 
   identified by the LSP ID TLV as defined in [5] in the MPLS-OAM 
   performance message.  

   MPLS-TP performance control message may include authentication TLV 
   defined in [4].

                    Figure 2: Performance Request TLV 
    
   When a MEP wants to monitor performance on an MPLS-TP, it sends an 
   MPLS-OAM PC packet with Performance Request TLV. The Performance 
   Request message can be intercepted by either a MIP (due to TTL 
   expiry) or a MEP (simply because it is the egress LSR). 

   Performance Flow Packet Rate (in packets per second) specifies the 
   maximum rate at which MPLS-OAM PF packets can be sent. 

   Packet loss Report Rate specifies the maximum rate at which the loss 
   of MPLS-OAM PF packets can be reported to the sender MEP. 

   The receiver MIP or MEP MUST send either an ACK or NAK response to 
   the sender MEP using an MPLS OAM performance response message. An ACK 
   response is sent if the receiver can support the specified rates. 
   Otherwise, a NAK response is sent. Until an ACK response is received, 
   the sender MEP MUST NOT assume that the MPLS-TP LSP is ready for 
   performance monitoring. 

   If multiple Performance Request TLVs are present, only the first TLV 
   is taken into consideration.

   Performance monitor report MPLS-OAM Messages will be sent at the rate 
   that does not exceed the maximum packet loss reporting rate specified 
   in the MPLS-OAM Performance Request TLV. 

   This TLV includes the number of lost MPLS-OAM PF packets as well as 
   the total number of MPLS-OAM PF flow packets that it must have 
   received from the sender. The receiver figures out the latter using 
   the sequence number in the MPLS-OAM PF packets (described below). 

4.6. Performance Removal 

   When performance monitor mode operation of an MPLS-TP LSP is no 
   longer required, the MEP that previously sent the MPLS OAM 
   Performance request message sends another MPLS OAM performance 
   removal message. 

   The receiver MEP or MIP MUST send either an ACK or NAK response to 
   the sender MEP using an MPLS OAM performance response message. An ACK 
   response is sent if the MPLS-TP LSP is already monitoring 
   performance. Otherwise, a NAK response is sent.  

 
4.7. MPLS-OAM PF Packet 

   When the performance of MPLS-TP LSP is monitored, MPLS-OAM PF packets 
   are sent from the sender MEP to the MEP/MIP end of the flow. A PF 
   packet contains a sequence number and a time-stamp using which the 
   receiver can calculate packet loss and one-way delay/jitter.

4.8. Monitoring regular PW packets 

   When the performance of PW is monitored, in continuous mode, regular 
   PW data packets can be used to monitor performance. PW packets in the 
   presence of CW contain a sequence number that can be used to measure 
   packets loss.  

   Data traffic is sent over an MPLS-TP PW using the format shown

4.9. Network Management System 

   An operator should be able to provision any given LSR to: 

   1. Lock/Unlock any MPLS-TP LSP. 

   2. Send MPLS OAM packets from a MEP and notify NMS when MPLS OAM 
     response arrives.

Internet-Draft draft-boutros-mpls-tp-performance-01.txt      March 2009 
    

   When NMS is used to provision any of the above the functionality, the 
   corresponding MPLS OAM message is not used. 

5. Operation 

   Consider an MPLS-TP LSP LSR-1 <--> LSR-2 <--> LSR-3 <--> LSR-4 <--> 
   LSR-5. LSR-1 and LSR-5 are ingress and egress LSR for the respective 
   direction, and LSR-1 and LSR-5 act as MEPs and LSR-2, LSR-3 and LSR-5 
   acts as a MIPs. 

   Assume that the objective is to evaluate the performance of the 
   segment between LSR-1 and LSR-2 at LSR-1. Thus, LSR-2 is the 
   destination for the MPLS-OAM PM packets. 

   1- LSR-1 sends an optional Lock Request MPLS-OAM message to LSR-5 
      (egress LSR) to take the MPLS-TP LSP out of service 

   2- LSR-5 takes the MPLS-TP LSP out of service from data-plane and 
      sends an ACK MPLS-OAM message back to LSR-1 

   3- LSR-1 sends a PM Request MPLS-OAM message to LSR-2 containing its 
      source address the MPLS-TP LSP ID, and destination address of 
      LSR-2, maximum rate at which PF packets are to be sent, maximum 
      packet loss report rate (back to LSR-1), and an indication as to 
      whether or not LSR-2 also needs to send MPLS-OAM PM packets. 

   4- LSR-2 verifies the LSP ID, and the destination address and sends 
      a performance response MPLS-OAM message with return code 
      1(success) back to LSR-1 if it can handle the specified PM packet 
      transmission and loss reporting rate, otherwise LSR-2 sends the 
      performance response MPLS-OAM message with return code 2(failure) 
      back to LSR-1 with the following cause codes: 

         1. if destination address or LSP-ID cannot be matched, it sends 
            a response with cause code 1. 

         2. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with the 
            cause code 2. 

         3. if any of the TLV is not known, it sends a response with 
            cause code 3. It may also include the unknown TLVs. 

         4. if message authentication fails, it sends a response with 
            the cause code 4. 

         5. if the specified PF packet rate cannot be handled, it sends 
            a response with cause code 5. 
 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 11] 
    
Internet-Draft draft-boutros-mpls-tp-performance-01.txt      March 2009 
    

         6. if the specified packet loss report rate cannot be 
            supported, it sends a response with cause code 6. 

      Note that MPLS TTL value is set to 255 in the response message. 

      After receiving the ACK from LSR-2 for the MPLS-OAM PM request, 
      MPLS-OAM PF packets are transmitted on the MPLS-TP LSP.  

      Both LSR-1 and LSR-2 keep a count of the lost MPLS-OAM PF packets. 

      The receiver LSR computes the number of lost MPLS-OAM PF flow 
      packets using the sequence number. Note that the sequence number 
      equals the total number of packets that must have received in the 
      absence of any packet loss. 

      The receiver periodically send the number of lost MPLS-OAM PF 
      packets as well as the total number of MPLS-OAM PF packets that it 
      must have received to the sender. 

   Removal of PM mode (only for on-demand mode) 

   1- LSR-1 sends an MPLS-OAM message to LSR-2 in order to stop 
      operating the MPLS-TP LSP in Performance Management mode. 

   2- LSR-2 sends its latest Packet Loss Report to LSR-1 via an MPLS-OAM 
      message. 

   3- LSR-1 sends an Unlock Request MPLS-OAM message to LSR-5 

   4- LSR-5 puts the MPLS-TP LSP back in service and sends an ACK MPLS-
      OAM message back to LSR-1. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further 
   study. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   To be added.
