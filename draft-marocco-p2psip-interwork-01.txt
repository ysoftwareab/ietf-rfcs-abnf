Abstract

   This document describes how user agents registered in P2PSIP overlay
   networks can interwork with those in conventional SIP networks.
   Communications between any two user agents will happen through the
   SIP protocol and the location of SIP servers will follow the usual
   procedures.  However, interworking in some environments may require
   the support of additional elements; this document also describes such
   elements and how to locate them in P2PSIP overlays.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes how user agents registered in P2PSIP overlay
   networks [I-D.willis-p2psip-concepts] can interwork with those in
   conventional SIP networks [RFC3261].  In particular, no assumption is
   made about the overlay but that it allows clients and peers to insert
   and retrieve routing information, possibly bound to URIs [RFC3986].

   The main goal of peer-to-peer networks is to build distributed
   systems using resources such as bandwidth, storage and computation
   power, shared by participating peers.  P2PSIP overlay peer protocols,
   in particular, aim to enable lookup services for clients initiating
   and managing SIP protocol sessions without relying on central
   servers.

   To enable P2PSIP overlays to fully interwork with conventional SIP
   networks (i.e. handling sessions either originated or terminated in
   public domains), some peers must provide more resources than those
   required for maintaining the overlay through the P2PSIP peer
   protocol.  Indeed, connectivity with public domains requires some
   peers willing to share their ability to exchange messages with public
   hosts on the Internet and, even more important, to be registered in
   the public naming service (DNS) for a fully qualified domain name
   (FQDN) which uniquely identifies the overlay they participate in.

   The purpose of this document is to define the elements which can
   supply the additional resources required for full interworking, to
   specify how such elements can register and be located within the
   overlay, and to describe how user agents (UAs) can establish sessions
   across overlay boundaries.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Terminology defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] and in P2PSIP concepts
   draft [I-D.willis-p2psip-concepts] is used without definition.

   Conventional SIP Network: A SIP network where location and routing
   functionalities are provided by centralized elements, as described in
   RFC 3261 [RFC3261].

   Public SIP Network: A SIP network, either conventional or P2PSIP
   based, whose user agents can be located using procedures specified in
   RFC 3263 [RFC3263].

   P2PSIP Proxy Peer: An element registered with the P2PSIP overlay
   which is able to route SIP messages directed to public URLs.  If a
   P2PSIP proxy peer is bound to a FQDN, it can be used also for routing
   SIP messages directed to UAs in the P2PSIP overlay.

   Relay Agent Peer: An element registered with the P2PSIP overlay which
   provides relayed transport addresses through protocols like TURN
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] and TEREDO [RFC4380] for allowing media
   streaming between UAs without direct connectivity.

2.  Overview

   User agents registered in a P2PSIP overlay are able to reach each
   other through the SIP protocol, with resource location handled by the
   overlay itself.  Figure 1 shows a typical example of the very basic
   deployment, where the overlay supplies the functionalities which, in
   canonical networks, are usually provided by registrars and proxies.

   Session between P2PSIP user agents.  Media streams flow directly
   between UAs.

                                 Figure 1

   The example in Figure 1 requires that all UAs have direct
   connectivity with each other.  However, since such connectivity is
   often impeded by environmental constraints introduced by NATs,
   firewalls or simply by lack of physical links, resources other than
   those used for maintaining the overlay are generally needed for users
   to effectively establish multimedia sessions.

   Figure 2 shows an example where UAs use the overlay to store and
   locate locations of relay agent peers (Section 3.2) used to
   effectiverly exchange data such as media even when NATs are present.

   Session between P2PSIP user agents.  Media streams are relayed.

                                 Figure 2

   Overlays such as those depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2 can be used
   only for local communications.  Even in network environments where
   connectivity is not a problem, interworking with non-P2PSIP nodes
   must be considered.  While P2PSIP UAs can initiate sessions with
   conventional SIP UAs using common resolution procedures defined in
   RFC 3263 [RFC3263], they cannot be addressed in any way from outside
   the overlay.

   Overlays intended to provide global connectivity must provide
   interworking with canonical SIP, in addition to providing relaying
   services amongst the P2PSIP overlay peers.  These overlays must
   provide mechanisms for routing SIP messages to conventional SIP
   entities in the public Internet and to be located and contacted using
   standard SIP procedures.  Figure 3 shows an example where
   communication is enabled both within the overlay and across its
   boundaries, thanks to resources shared by P2PSIP Proxy Peers
   (Section 3.1).

   Example of a system connecting a UA in a P2PSIP overlay and one in a
   conventional SIP network.  The user in the P2PSIP overlay is
   addressed by her local URI and data streams are relayed.

                                 Figure 3

   It is worth noting that, in the example in Figure 3, users who
   register in the overlay MUST have URLs whose host parts match with
   the FQDN for which overlay's P2PSIP proxy peers are bound to.  That
   is, the P2P overlay identifier for the overlay must be an FQDN.
   Section 4 defines the detailed procedure for user registration.

   Overlays such as the one in Figure 3, which have resources for both
   relaying data and routing SIP messages to and from public servers can
   be considered equivalent to conventional SIP networks when viewed
   from the outside.  Such a property is extremely important for P2PSIP
   UAs which have also an account with conventional SIP providers, but
   do not have direct connectivity with their servers.  Indeed, such
   UAs, following the usual procedures defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261],
   can register their overlay URL as a contact for their conventional
   SIP address of record (AOR).

   Figure 4 shows an example where a user (alice) registers both in an
   overlay (p2psip.org) and, through P2PSIP proxy peers, with a
   conventional SIP network (sip:example.org).  SIP messages sent by
   another user (carol) who only knows her conventional SIP URL
   (sip:alice@example.org) are routed to her conventional SIP proxy
   (sip:example.org) and, from here, to overlay's P2PSIP proxy
   peers(sip:p2psip.org) which eventually reach her through the overlay.

2.1.  P2PSIP Overlay Identifier

   For overlays which wish to interconnect with existing SIP networks,
   the P2PSIP overlay identifier MUST be a FQDN.  Moreover, some entity
   (humans or automata) responsible for the overlay MUST be able to
   manipulate DNS records referring to such identifier for registering
   and unregistering P2PSIP proxy peers as defined in Section 3.1.

   Procedures for selecting overlay identifiers and for manipulating DNS
   records are outside of the scope of this document.

3.  Additional Logical Elements for Interworking

   This section describes the network elements which provide the
   additional resources that P2PSIP overlays need for interworking with
   conventional SIP networks.  Note that these are logical roles, and
   may (and in fact likely would) be combined into one entity such as a
   P2PSIP UA.  As with the functions in RFC 3261 [RFC3261], we treat
   them as separate entities in this document for clarity.

3.1.  P2PSIP Proxy Peer

   A P2PSIP proxy peer, as mentioned in [I-D.willis-p2psip-concepts]
   (Section 3.1, "What Kinds of P2PSIP Peers and Clients Might Exist?"),
   is an element which can exchange SIP messages with public domains and
   provides this function as a service to the overlay it is registered
   in.  In particular, the most important characteristics are the
   following:

   o  A P2PSIP proxy peer MUST be able to send SIP requests and receive
      SIP responses directed to hosts with a public Internet address.

   o  A P2PSIP proxy peer MUST be able to perform location procedures
      defined in RFC 3263 [RFC3263].  This implies that it MUST also be
      able to query the DNS.

   o  A P2PSIP proxy peer SHOULD have a binding in the DNS so that any
      resolution for the overlay identifier performed according to
      location procedures defined in RFC 3263 [RFC3263] returns a list
      of P2PSIP proxy peers including this node.  If such binding
      doesn't exist for any of the P2PSIP proxy peers, the overlay
      cannot be reached by public SIP networks.

   P2PSIP proxy peer MUST record route on SIP request crossing overlay's
   boundaries, using the overlay identifier instead of their local
   address, due to the ephemeral nature of P2PSIP nodes.

3.1.1.  Insertion into DNS

   The mechanism for registering P2PSIP proxy peers with the DNS is a
   critical point of the overlay.  In fact, if the authorization
   policies are too permissive, it could be exploited by malicious nodes
   for denial of service attacks, while, if they are too strict, it
   could introduce a bottleneck in negation with the peer-to-peer model.
   Future specifications need to provide mechanisms for managing
   controlled registration with the DNS, allowing the adoption of
   different policies in different deployments.

   P2PSIP proxy peers will generally be located on devices with direct

   Internet access.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED to insert records in the DNS
   for P2PSIP proxy peers behind NATs.  While NAT traversal mechanisms
   such as STUN [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] and TEREDO [RFC4380] can be
   used to determine a public address and port which can be registered
   in the DNS, NAT binding changes are not deterministic and can cause
   inconsistencies.

3.2.  Relay Agent Peer

   A relay agent peer is an element which can directly exchange media
   with hosts on the public Internet.  STUN relay servers (previously
   called TURN servers), specified in the STUN draft
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] and TEREDO [RFC4380] relays are typical
   examples of relay agents.

   Relay agent peers can be located behind some types of NATs if, using
   traversal mechanisms not based on relay (e.g.  STUN
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis]), they can obtain several public
   address-port pairs.

3.2.1.  Relay Agent Peer Selection

   It is extremely difficult to determine apriori which type of relay
   agent peer fits best for a media session with a particular UA.  To
   avoid this choice, UAs SHOULD find as many relay agent peers as
   possible and MUST establish media sessions using the ICE
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] mechanism so that the most appropriate relay
   can be chosen at run time.

3.3.  Locating the new Elements

   P2PSIP UAs often need to locate resources or obtain services provided
   by P2PSIP proxy peers and relay agent peers.  Such lookup is
   performed directly in the overlay through the P2PSIP client protocol.

   One possible way to allow the location of resources within the
   overlay is to define URI for identifying the elements which provide
   them.  While many mechanisms are possible, we outline a simple
   possible approach below.

3.3.1.  P2PSIP Proxy Peer URI

   P2PSIP proxy peers act as SIP servers and are identified by SIP URLs.
   Such URLs MUST have only the host field set, and its value MUST match
   the overlay identifier.

   For example, the URL which identifies P2PSIP proxy peers registered
   within the overlay "p2psip.org" could be "sip:p2psip.org".

Internet-Draft     Interworking between P2PSIP and SIP        March 2007


      It is worth noting that the lookups of P2PSIP proxy peers, made in
      the overlay or in the DNS, are conceptually identical.

3.3.2.  Relay Agent Peers URIs

   Since relay agent peers can implement different protocols, there will
   be different URI schemas for identifying each kind.  As a general
   rule, URLs identifying relay agent peers which implement a given
   protocol, will be formed according to the specific scheme and will
   have the host field (or the equivalent field) matching the overlay
   identifier.

   While such URI schema do not currently exist, one could use something
   like "turn:p2psip.org" and "teredo:p2psip.org" identify relay agent
   peers registered in the overlay "p2psip.org" and implementing TURN
   and TEREDO protocols respectively.

3.3.3.  Impacts on the Overlay

   In overlays where the load balancing among all peers utilizes a key-
   partitioning approach, the lookup of services based on well known
   URIs would cause dangerous displacements of the overlay traffic.  In
   fact, since many clients and peers need to know the location of a
   relay agent peer, the peer responsible for a URI which identifies any
   of those would have to handle much more lookup requests than other
   peers which store only user records.

4.  User Registration

   In order to be reachable from a conventional SIP UA, a UA
   participating in a P2PSIP overlay that supports interworking MUST
   create a binding in the overlay between its local contact and an URL
   (i.e.  P2PSIP overlay user identifier) as defined in Section 4.1.  If
   the user associated with the UA has another public SIP URI, they MAY
   register such a URL with the authoritative registrar using a P2PSIP
   proxy peer as described in Section 4.2.

4.1.  Registering with the Overlay

   UAs perform registration in the overlay through the P2PSIP client
   protocol.  Such registration consists of an insertion of a P2PSIP
   overlay user routing record bound to the user identifier.

   To support interworking with canonical SIP, the user identifier MUST
   be a well formed SIP URL, with the host field matching the overlay
   identifier.  The user field MUST be set, and its value will usually
   be the P2PSIP overlay user identifier.

   According to local policies, the user MAY need to enroll and obtain
   appropriate credentials for their URL before being able to register
   records for it.

4.2.  Registering with a Public SIP Network

   Users registered in fully interworking P2PSIP overlays can use P2PSIP
   proxy peers for sending messages to public SIP networks.  This is
   especially useful for registering bindings for AORs for which the
   overlay is not authoritative.  This mechanism can be used to register
   the contact for a node participating in a P2PSIP overlay with a well
   known SIP URI associated with the user that is well known to their
   usual buddies but outside the overlay.

   For registering with a public SIP network, an UA follows these steps:

   1.  The UA MUST perform user registration as defined in Section 4.1.

   2.  The UA MUST get the address of a P2PSIP proxy peer performing a
       lookup as defined in Section 3.3.

   3.  The UA MUST send a REGISTER message for binding the URL it has
       registered in the overlay to its public AOR.  The message MUST be
       sent using the P2PSIP proxy peer as an outbound proxy.

   First Alice queries the overlay for discovering the location of some
   relay agent peers (1-2) and initializes one (3-4) for preparing an
   ICE candidate.  Then she sends an INVITE request with an ICE offer to
   Bob through the overlay (5-6).

   When Bob receives the INVITE, he queries the overlay to obtain the
   location of some relay agent peers (7-8) and initializes one (9-10)
   for preparing an ICE candidate.  Then the session establishment
   completes carrying ICE offers and answers and following the signaling
   path of the first INVITE (11).

   Eventually, the media is relayed across both Alice's and Bob's relay
   agent peers (12).

   procedure (RFC3263) and finds the address of one or more P2PSIP proxy
   peers for the overlay.  Carol then sends an INVITE message addressed
   to Alice to any one of the set of such addresses (1).  The P2PSIP

   Finally, media is relayed across Alice's relay agent peer (9).

   Right after registering in the overlay, Alices queries the location
   of some P2PSIP proxy peers (1-2) and sends a REGISTER request to her
   public SIP server through one of them, binding the URL registered in

   the overlay to her public AOR (4-3).

   When Carol wants to contact Alice, she sends an INVITE request
   addressed to her public SIP proxy (5).  The proxy finds in its local
   database the binding with the URL registered in the overlay, so it
   performs a conventional SIP location procedure (RFC3263) for the
   overlay identifier (i.e. the domain of the URL) and finds the address
   of one or more P2PSIP proxy peers.  Then it routes the INVITE message
   to any of those (6), which in turn routes the INVITE to Alice through
   the overlay (7-8) using the overlay's resource location and routing
   mechanisms.

   When Alice receives the INVITE, she queries the overlay to discover
   the location of one or more relay agent peers (9-10) and initializes
   one for preparing an ICE candidate (or an answer, if the INVITE
   didn't declare to support ICE) (11-12).

   Then the session establishment completes carrying ICE offers and
   answers (if the INVITE declared to support it) (13).

   Finally, media is relayed across Alice's relay agent peer (14).

6.  Security Considerations

   Besides the security issues already raised in SIP [2] and other
   P2PSIP work, the interconnection model based on "well known" URIs is
   vulnerable to spoofing attacks.  More work, or the application of
   existing SIP work on identity should applied to this to mitigate this
   risk.

   Another security issue is the registration of P2PSIP proxy peers with
   a public DNS; it could be either a point of failure, if registration
   policies are too permissive, or a threat to the peer-to-peer model,
   if they are too restrictive.  Mechanisms must allow for nodes to be
   entered and removed, in a secure fashion.  This work is related to
   and likely to use dynamic DNS.

   In a full interworking scenario identity assertion is critically
   important; this document shows how it could be achieved proxying
   regular authentication to traditional SIP domains.  Mechanisms such
   as issuing certificates to assert and validate user identities should
   be used.

7.  Open Issues

   1.  We need to define a mechanism for authenticating, inserting and
       removing DNS records for the overlay.  Need to work with dynamic
       DNS group to address this.

   2.  Service location based on well-known URIs impacts the overlay
       load-balance, especially if it is based on key partitioning among
       peers.

   3.  Clients route SIP messages addressed to external hosts directly
       to P2PSIP proxy peers, without involving the overlay.  We should
       define in details how and why this works, but there are some
       implications on the P2PSIP client protocol to be defined.  If the
       overlay is supposed to let also conventional SIP user agents
       work, such routing must be done directly by peers.

   4.  URI schemes for relay agent peers are not defined and are also
       needed for things besides interworking.  Is it feasible to define
       URNs for those protocols for which a URI schema does not exist?

   5.  As security/identity mechanisms for P2PSIP (certificate based or
       otherwise) emerge, they should be worked into this document.
