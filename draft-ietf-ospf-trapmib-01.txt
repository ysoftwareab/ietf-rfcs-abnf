     2.0     Abstract

          OSPF [1] is an event driven routing protocol, where an event  can
          be a change in an OSPF interface's link-level status, the expira-
          tion of an OSPF timer  or  the  reception  of  an  OSPF  protocol
          packet.  Many of the actions that OSPF takes as a result of these
          events will result in a change of the routing topology.  As rout-
          ing  topologies become large and complex it is often difficult to
          locate the source of a topology  change  or  unpredicted  routing
          path  by  polling a large number or routers.  Another approach is
          to notify a network manager of potentially critical  OSPF  events
          with SNMP traps.

          This draft document defines a set of traps, objects  and  mechan-
          isms  to enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks which use
          OSPF as its IGP.  It is meant as an extension  to  the  OSPF  MIB
          [2].


     3.0     The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management  Framework  consists  of
          three components. They are:

               RFC 1155 [5] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used  for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
               RFC 1212 [8] defines a more concise  description  mechanism,
               which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

               RFC 1156 [6] which defines MIB-I, the core  set  of  managed
               objects  for  the  Internet suite of protocols. RFC 1213 [9]
               defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based  on  implementa-
               tion experience and new operational requirements.

     Internet Draft            OSPF Trap MIB                  November 1992


               RFC 1157 [7] which defines the SNMP, the protocol  used  for
               network access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for  the  purpose
          of experimentation and evaluation.


     4.0     Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via  a  virtual  information  store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB
          are defined using the subset  of  Abstract  Syntax  Notation  One
          (ASN.1)  [3] defined in the SMI. In particular, each object has a
          name, a syntax, and an encoding. The name is an  object  identif-
          ier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object
          type. The object type together with an object instance serves  to
          uniquely  identify  a  specific  instantiation of the object. For
          human convenience, we often use  a  textual  string,  termed  the
          OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data  structure
          corresponding  to  that  object type.  The ASN.1 language is used
          for this purpose. However, the SMI purposely restricts the  ASN.1
          constructs  which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly
          made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type  is
          represented  using  the  object type's syntax. Implicitly tied to
          the notion of an object type's syntax and  encoding  is  how  the
          object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.

          The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding  rules  of  ASN.1
          [4], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

          The SMI does not provide a means for defining traps.   The  SNMP,
          however,  does  define  a few standard traps and provides a means
          for defining  enterprise-specific  traps.   The  TRAP-TYPE  macro
          defined  in  RFC  1215  [10] suggests a straight-forward approach
          towards defining traps used with the SNMP.


     4.1     Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains the specification of  all  object  types  con-
          tained in this MIB module. The object types are defined using the
          conventions defined in the SMI,  as  amended  by  the  extensions
          specified in RFC 1212.

          Section 6.3 contains contains  the  trap  definitions  using  the
          TRAP-TYPE macro described in RFC 1215.

     Internet Draft            OSPF Trap MIB                  November 1992


     5.0     Approach

          The mechanism for sending traps  is  straight-forward.   When  an
          exception  event occurs, the application notifies the local agent
          who sends a trap to the  appropriate  SNMP  management  stations.
          The message includes the trap type and may include a list of trap
          specific variables.  A new object is defined in section 6.2  that
          will allow a network manager to enable or disable particular OSPF
          traps.  Section 6.3 gives the trap definitions which includes the
          variable  lists.   The router ID of the originator of the trap is
          included in the variable list so that  the  network  manager  may
          easily determine the source of the trap.

          To limit the frequency of OSPF traps,  the  following  additional
          mechanisms are suggested.


     5.1     Ignoring Initial Activity

          The majority of critical events occur when OSPF is enabled  on  a
          router, at which time the designated router is elected and neigh-
          bor adjacencies are formed.  During this initial period a  poten-
          tial flood of traps is unnecessary since the events are expected.
          To  avoid  unnecessary  traps,  a  router  should  not  originate
          expected   OSPF   interface  related  traps  until  two  of  that
          interface's dead timer intervals have elapsed.  The expected OSPF
          interface  traps  are  ospfIfStateChange,  ospfVirtIfStateChange,
          ospfNbrStateChange, ospfVirtNbrStateChange,  ospfTxRetranmit  and
          ospfVirtIfTxRetransmit.  Additionally, ospfMaxAgeLsa and ospfOri-
          ginateLsa traps should not be originated  until  two  dead  timer
          intervals  have elapsed where the dead timer interval used should
          be the dead timer with the smallest value.


     5.2     Throttling Traps

          The mechanism for throttling the traps is similar to the  mechan-
          ism explained in RFC 1224 [11] section 5.  The basic idea is that
          there is a sliding window in seconds and an upper  bound  on  the
          number of traps that may be generated within this window.  Unlike
          RFC 1224, traps are not sent to inform the network  manager  that
          the throttling mechanism has kicked in.

          A single window should be used to throttle all OSPF  traps  types
          except  for the ospfLsdbOverflow and the ospfLsdbApproachingOver-
          flow trap which should not be throttled.   For  example,  if  the
          window  time is 3, the upper bound is 3 and the events that would
          cause trap types 1,3,5 and 7 occur within a 3 second period,  the
          type 7 trap should not be generated.

          Appropriate values are 7 traps with a window time of 10 seconds.


     5.3     One Trap Per OSPF Event



     Coltun and Baker       Expires May 31 1993                    [Page 4]





     Internet Draft            OSPF Trap MIB                  November 1992


          Several of the traps defined in section 6.3 are generated as  the
          result  of  finding  an  unusual  condition while parsing an OSPF
          packet or a processing a timer event.  There may be more than one
          unusual  condition  detected while handling the event.  For exam-
          ple, a link-state update packet may contain several retransmitted
          link-state  advertisements  (LSAs),  or  a retransmitted database
          description  packet  may  contain  several  database  description
          entries.  To limit the number of traps and variables, OSPF should
          generate at most one trap per OSPF  event.   Only  the  variables
          associated  with  the  first unusual condition should be included
          with the trap.  Similarly, if more than one type of unusual  con-
          dition  is  encountered  while parsing the packet, only the first
          event will generate a trap.


     5.4     Polling Event Counters

          Many of the tables in the  OSPF  MIB  contain  generalized  event
          counters.   By enabling the traps defined in this document a net-
          work manager can obtain more  specific  information  about  these
          events.   A network manager may want to poll these event counters
          and enable specific OSPF traps when a particular  counter  starts
          increasing abnormally.

          The following table shows  the  relationship  between  the  event
          counters  defined  in  the OSPF MIB and the trap types defined in
          section 6.3.
