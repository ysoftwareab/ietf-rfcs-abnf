1. Introduction 

   SIP has become a widely-used standard among many service providers, 
   vendors, and end users.  Although there are many different standards 
   for measuring the performance of signaling protocols, none of them 
   specifically address SIP.

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics    December 2007 
 
 
   The scope of this document is limited to the definitions of a 
   standard set of metrics for measuring and reporting SIP performance 
   from an end-to-end perspective.  The metrics introduce a common 
   foundation for understanding and quantifying performance expectations 
   between service providers, vendors, and the users of services based 
   on SIP. 

   Measurements of the metrics described in this document are affected 
   by variables external to SIP.  The following is a non-exhaustive list 
   of examples:  

     . Network connectivity 

     . Switch and router performance 

     . Server processes and hardware performance 

   Note that some metrics in this document may not apply to all 
   applications of SIP.  This document provides an overview of pertinent 
   metrics, which may be used individually or as a set based on the 
   usage of SIP within the context of a given service. 

   The metrics defined in this document DO NOT take into consideration 
   the impairment or failure of actual application processing of a 
   request or response.  The metrics do not distinguish application 
   processing time from other sources of delay, such as packet transfer 
   delay. 

   Metrics designed to quantify single device application processing 
   performance are beyond the scope of this document. 

   This document does not provide any numerical objectives or acceptance 
   threshold values for the SIP performance metrics defined below, as 
   these items are beyond the scope of IETF activities, in general. 

2.  Terminology 

   The following terms and conventions will be used throughout this 
   document: 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

   End-to-End - This is described as two or more elements utilized for 
   initiating a request, receiving the request, and responding to the 
   request.  It encompasses elements as necessary to be involved in a 
   session dialog between the originating user agent client (UAC), 
   destination user agent server (UAS), and any interim proxies (may 
 
 
Malas                    Expires June 6, 2008                  [Page 3] 
Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics    December 2007 
 
 
   also include back-to-back user agent's (B2BUA's)). This may be 
   relative to a single operator's set of elements or extend to 
   encompass all elements (if beyond a single operator's network) 
   associated with a session. 

   Session - As described in RFC 3261, SIP is used primarily to request, 
   create, and conclude sessions.  "These sessions include Internet 
   telephone calls, multimedia distribution, and multimedia conferences 
   [2]."  The metrics within this document measure the performance 
   associated with the processes necessary to establish these sessions; 
   therefore, they are titled as: Session Request Delay, Session 
   Disconnect Delay, etc.  Although the titles of many of the metrics 
   include this term, they are specifically measuring the signaling 
   aspects only. 

   Session Establishment - Session establishment occurs when a 200 OK 
   response from the UAS has been received, in response to a 
   corresponding UAC's INVITE setup request, indicating the session 
   setup request was successful. 

   Session Setup - As referenced within the sub-sections of 3.2 in this 
   document, session setup is the set of messages and included 
   parameters directly related to the process of a UAC requesting to 
   establish a session with a corresponding UAS.  This is also described 
   as a set of steps in order to establish "ringing" [2]. 

   Time Begin (TB) - This is the time instant that starts a continuous 
   time interval running when a request is sent.  TB occurs when the 
   designated request has been processed by the SIP application and the 
   first bit of the request packet has been sent from the proxy or UA 
   (and is externally observable at some logical or physical interface). 

   Time Stop (TS) - This is the time instant that ends a continuous time 
   interval running from when the related request is sent.  TS occurs 
   when the last bit of the designated response is received by the SIP 
   application at the requesting device (and is externally observable at 
   some logical or physical interface). 

3. SIP Performance Metrics 

   In regards to all of the following metrics, TB begins with the first 
   associated SIP message sent by the UAC or UAS, and is not reset if 
   the UAC or UAS must retransmit the same request multiple times.  The 
   first associated SIP message indicates the TB associated with the 
   user or application expectation relative to the request. 

   Some metrics are calculated based on the final response message.  
   These metrics do not take into consideration route advances to 
   additional signaling functions based on "final" failure responses.

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics    December 2007 
 
 
   In these unique cases, the final response related to the initial 
   setup attempt should be utilized for input to the metric. 

   In regards to all of the metrics, the output values are directly 
   related to the accuracy and the equivalent level of granularity of 
   the input values. 

   The following metrics may be utilized for many different SIP 
   applications. 

3.1. Registration Request Delay (RRD) 

   Registration Request Delay is utilized to detect failures or 
   impairments causing delays in responding to a UAC REGISTER request.  
   RRD is measured for both successful and failed REGISTER requests.  
   This metric is measured at the UAC only.  The output value of this 
   metric is numerical and should be adjusted to indicate milliseconds.  
   The following represents the calculation for this metric: 

   RRD = Time of Final Response - Time of REGISTER Request 

   An average is one of the uses of this metric.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 

          SUM (Time of Final Response - Time of REGISTER Request) 
   ARRD = ------------------------------------------------------- 
                        SUM # of REGISTER Requests 
    
3.1.1. Successful REGISTER Completion RRD 

   In a successful registration attempt, RRD is defined as the time 
   interval from the moment the initial REGISTER message containing the 
   necessary information is passed by the originating UAC to the 
   intended registrar until the 200OK is received indicating the 
   registration attempt has completed successfully.  This dialog 
   includes an expected authentication challenge prior to receiving the 
   200OK as describe in the following registration flow examples. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating RRD during a successful 
   registration completion:

                |REGISTER              | 
         TB---->|--------------------->| 
            /\  |                   401| 
            ||  |<---------------------| 
           RRD  |REGISTER              | 
            ||  |--------------------->| 
            \/  |                   200| 
         TS---->|<---------------------| 
                |                      | 

3.1.2. Failed REGISTER Attempt RRD 

   In a failed registration attempt, the interval is defined from the 
   initial REGISTER request and the final response indicating a failure 
   received from the destination registrar or interim proxies (Note: 
   Many times registration attempts are repeated; therefore, a failed 
   scenario must identify a failure response associated with the final 
   attempt).  A failure response is described as a 4XX, 5XX, or possible 
   6XX message.  RRD may be used to detect problems in downstream 
   signaling functions, which may be impairing the REGISTER message from 
   reaching the intended registrar. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating RRD during a failed registration 
   attempt:  
      
               UA1                Registrar 
                |                      | 
                |REGISTER              | 
         TB---->|--------------------->| 
            /\  |                   401| 
            ||  |<---------------------| 
           RRD  |REGISTER              | 
            ||  |--------------------->| 
            \/  |                   401| 
         TS---->|<---------------------| 
                |                      | 

   Note: A second 401 was used due to a common failure related to 
   incorrect authentication credentials related to the second REGISTER 
   request after the initial request failed. In this case, the UAC gives 
   up on attempting to REGISTER with the registrar.

3.2. Session Request Delay (SRD) 

   Session Request Delay is utilized to detect failures or impairments 
   causing delays in responding to a UA session request.  SRD is 
   measured for both successful and failed session setup requests.    
   This metric is similar to Post-Selection Delay [9] or Post-Dial Delay 
   (PDD) in telephony applications of SIP, and it is measured at the UAC 
   only.  The output value of this metric is numerical and should be 
   adjusted to indicate milliseconds.  The following represents the 
   calculation for this metric: 

   SRD = Time of Status Indicative Response - Time of INVITE 

   An average is one of the uses of this metric.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 
           
          SUM (Time of Status Indicative Response - Time of INVITE) 
   ASRD = --------------------------------------------------------- 
                          SUM # of INVITE Requests 

3.2.1. Successful Session Setup SRD 

   In a successful request attempt, SRD is defined as the time interval 
   from the moment the INVITE message containing the necessary 
   information is passed by the originating agent or user to the 
   intended mediation or destination agent until the first provisional 
   response is received indicating an audible or visual status of the 
   initial session setup request.  In SIP, the message indicating status 
   would be a non-100 Trying provisional message received in response to 
   an INVITE request.  In some cases, a non-100 Trying provisional 
   message is not received, but rather a 200 message is received as the 
   first status message instead.  In these situations, the 200 message 
   would be used to calculate the interval. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SRD during a successful session 
   setup request without a redirect (i.e. 3XX message):  
      
               UA1                    UA2 
                |                      |

3.2.2. Failed Session Setup SRD 

   In a failed request attempt, the interval is defined from the initial 
   session request and a non-100 Trying provisional message or a failure 
   indication response.  A failure response is described as a 4XX, 5XX, 
   or possible 6XX message.  SRD may be used to detect problems in 
   downstream signaling functions, which may be impairing the INVITE 
   message from reaching the intended UA. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SRD during a failed session setup 
   attempt without a redirect (i.e. 3XX message): 
      
               UA1                    UA2

   above metric, INVITE can be replaced with MESSAGE to provide SRD for 
   instant messaging (IM).  The dialog will vary slightly as described 
   in [10].  The inputs for this metric should be utilized regardless of 
   whether a prior SIP dialog was utilized to setup the session.  In 
   that case both the SIP dialog and the MESSAGE requests are measured 
   independently. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SRD during a successful session 
   MESSAGE request:  
      
               UA1                    UA2 
                |                      | 
                |MESSAGE               | 
         TB---->|--------------------->| 
            /\  |                      | 
            ||  |                      | 
           SRD  |                      |

                |                      | 

   Failure requests occur similarly as to those described in section 
   3.2.2 with MESSAGE in replacement of INVITE as the IM session request 
   method. 

    
3.3. Session Disconnect Delay (SDD) 

   This metric is utilized to detect failures or impairments delaying 
   the time necessary to end a session.  It can be measured from both a 
   UAC and UAS perspective.  SDD is measured for both successful and

   failed session completions.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate milliseconds.  The 
   following represents the calculation for this metric: 

   SDD = Time of 2XX or Timeout - Time of Completion Message (BYE) 

   An average is one of the uses of this metric.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 
    
          SUM (Time of 2XX or Timeout - Time of Completion Message) 
   ASDD = --------------------------------------------------------- 
                        SUM # of Completed Sessions  

3.3.1. Successful session completion SDD 

   In a successful session completion, SDD is defined as the interval 
   between sending a session completion message, such as a BYE, and 
   receiving the subsequent 2XX acknowledgement.  The following flows 
   provide an example of identifiable events necessary for inputs in 
   calculating SDD during a successful session completion:

3.3.2. Failed session completion SDD 

   In some cases, no response is received after a session completion 
   message is sent and potentially retried.  In this case, SDD is 
   defined as the interval between sending a session completion message, 
   such as a BYE, and the resulting Timer F expiration.  The following

   in calculating SDD during a failed session completion attempt:

3.4. Session Duration Time (SDT) 

   This metric is used to detect problems (e.g. poor audio quality) 
   causing short session durations.  SDT is measured for both successful 
   and failed session completions.  It can be measured from both a UAC 
   and UAS perspective.  This metric is similar to Call Hold Time, and 
   is traditionally calculated as Average Call Hold Time (ACHT) in

   telephony applications of SIP.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate minutes and seconds.  
   The following represents the calculation for this metric: 

   SDT = Time of BYE or Timeout - Time of 200 OK response to INVITE 

   An average is one of the uses of this metric.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 
            
        SUM (Time of BYE or Timeout - Time of 200 OK response to INVITE) 
   ASDT = -------------------------------------------------------------- 
                  SUM # of INVITE w/ 200OK & BYE or Timeout 

3.4.1. Successful session completion SDT 

   In a successful session completion, SDT is calculated as an average 
   and is defined as the duration of a dialog from receipt of a 200 OK 
   response to an INVITE and an associated BYE message indicating dialog 
   completion. 

   The following flows provide an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SDT during a successful session 
   completion (The message flows are changed between the UAC and UAS to 
   provide varying examples.):

3.5. Average Hops per Request (AHR) 

   This metric is used to indicate potential inefficient routing and to 
   detect failure occurrences related to the number of elements 
   traversed by a single SIP INVITE or MESSAGE request.  AHR is defined 
   as the number of hops traversed by an INVITE or MESSAGE request.  It 
   is calculated as an average.  This metric requires the Max-Forwards 
   value to be captured at both the originating UAC or proxy and the 
   terminating UAS or proxy perspective as relative to the end-to-end

   network under measurement.  The output value of this metric is 
   measured in a numerical value indicating a number of hops. 

   Variables = 

      a = Initial INVITE/MESSAGE "Max-Forwards" value 

      b = Initial INVITE/MESSAGE received by terminating UAS "Max-        
      Forwards" value 

      c = # of Hops for INVITE/MESSAGE requests 

      d = SUM # of INVITE/MESSAGE requests 

      c = a - b  

   This metric is calculated as an average.  The following represents 
   the calculation for this metric: 
        
      AHR = (SUM of aggregate c's / d) 
    
   The following dialog provides an example describing the inputs 
   necessary for this calculation.  Although this example is of an 
   INVITE SIP dialog request, a MESSAGE request is similar in its use of 
   the Max-Forwards header. (The dialog continuation was omitted for 
   clarity):

3.6. Session Establishment Rate (SER) 

   This metric is used to detect the ability of a terminating UA or 
   downstream proxy to successfully establish sessions per INVITE 
   request.  SER is defined as the number of INVITE requests resulting 
   in a 200 OK response, to the total number of attempted INVITE 
   requests less INVITE requests resulting in a 3XX response.  This 
   metric is similar to Answer Seizure Rate (ASR) [8] in telephony 
   applications of SIP.  It is measured at the UAC only.  The output 
   value of this metric is numerical and should be adjusted to indicate

   a percentage of successfully established sessions.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric: 
    
                   # of INVITE Requests w/ associated 200OK 
   SER = --------------------------------------------------------------- 
     (Total # of INVITE Requests)-(# of INVITE Requests w/ 3XX Response) 
    
   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in determining session establishment as 
   described above: 
    
                        UA1                 UA2

            +----------->|<------------------| 
                         |                   | 
3.6.1. Instant Messaging 

   This metric is also applicable to MESSAGE [10] requests.  In the 
   above metric, INVITE can be replaced with MESSAGE to provide SER for 
   IM.  The dialog will vary slightly as described in [10]. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SER for MESSAGE requests: 

                        UA1                 UA2 
                         |                   | 
                         |MESSAGE            | 
            +----------->|------------------>| 
            |            |                   | 
   Session Established   |                   | 
            |            |                200| 
            +----------->|<------------------| 
                         |                   | 

    
3.7. Session Establishment Efficiency Rate (SEER) 

   This metric is complimentary to SER, but is intended to exclude the 
   potential effects of the terminating UAS from the metric.  SEER is 
   defined as the number of INVITE requests resulting in a 200 OK 
   response and INVITE requests resulting in a 480, 486, or 600; to the 
   total number of attempted INVITE requests less INVITE requests 
 
 
Malas                    Expires June 6, 2008                 [Page 18] 
Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics    December 2007 
 
 
   resulting in a 3XX response.  This metric is similar to Network 
   Efficiency Rate (NER) [8] in telephony applications of SIP.  It is 
   measured at the UAC only.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage of 
   successfully established sessions less common UAS failures.  The 
   following represents the calculation for this metric: 

         # of INVITE Requests w/ associated 200OK, 480, 486, or 600 
   SER = --------------------------------------------------------------- 
     (Total # of INVITE Requests)-(# of INVITE Requests w/ 3XX Response) 

   Reference the example flow is Section 3.6. 

3.8. Session Defects (SD) 

   Session defects provide a subset of SIP failure responses, which 
   consistently indicate a failure in dialog processing.  Defects are 
   necessary to provide input to calculations such as Defects per 
   Million (DPM) or other similar metrics.  These failure responses are 
   in response to initial session setup requests, such as a new INVITE.  
   The output value of this metric is numerical and should be adjusted 
   to indicate a percentage of defective sessions.  The following 
   failure responses provide a guideline for defective criterion: 

     . 500 Server Internal Error 

     . 503 Service Unavailable 

     . 504 Server Timeout 

   This set of failure responses was derived through correlating more 
   granular ISUP failure responses as described in RFC 3398. 

3.9. Ineffective Session Attempts (ISA) 

   Ineffective session attempts occur when a proxy or agent internally 
   releases a setup request with a failed or congested condition. This 
   metric is similar to Ineffective Machine Attempts (IMA) in telephony 
   applications of SIP, and was adopted from Telcordia GR-512-CORE [7].  
   The output value of this metric is numerical and should be adjusted 
   to indicate a percentage of ineffective session attempts.  The 
   following failure responses provide a guideline for this criterion: 

     . 408 Request Timeout 

     . 500 Server Internal Error 

     . 503 Service Unavailable 

 
 
Malas                    Expires June 6, 2008                 [Page 19] 
Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics    December 2007 
 
 
     . 504 Server Timeout 

   This set was derived in a similar manner as described in Section 3.6, 
   in addition 408 failure responses is indicative a congested state 
   with a downstream element. 

   This metric is calculated as a percentage of total session setup 
   requests.  The following represents the calculation for this metric: 

                   # of ISA  
   ISA % = -----------------------------  
            Total # of Session Requests 

3.10. Session Disconnect Failures (SDF) 

   Session disconnect failures occur when an active session is 
   terminated due to a failure condition that can be identified by a 
   REASON header [5] in a BYE message.  This occurs, for example, when a 
   user agent (UA) is controlling an IP or TDM (Time Division 
   Multiplexing) media gateway, and the media gateway notifies the UA of 
   a failure condition causing the loss of media related to an 
   established session.  The UA will release the session with a BYE, but 
   should include a REASON header indicating the session was 
   disconnected abnormally.  The REASON value is utilized to determine 
   the disconnect was a failure.  This metric is similar to Cutoff Calls 
   (CC) in telephony applications of SIP, and was adopted from Telcordia 
   GR-512-CORE [7].  The input variables for this metric are captured 
   from the originating UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-
   to-end network under measurement.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage of session 
   disconnect failures. 

   This metric is calculated as a percentage of total session completed 
   successfully as defined in Section 3.5.  The following represents the 
   calculation for this metric:     

                     # of SDF's 
   SDF % = -------------------------------  
             Total # of Session Requests 

3.11. Session Completion Rate (SCR) 

   A session completion is defined as a SIP dialog, which completes 
   without failing due to a lack of response from an intended proxy or 
   UA.  This metric is only used when at least one proxy is involved in 
   the dialog.  This metric is similar to Call Completion Rate (CCR) in 
   telephony applications of SIP.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage of 
   successfully completed sessions.

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics    December 2007 
 
 
   This metric is calculated as a percentage of total sessions completed 
   successfully.  The following represents the calculation for this 
   metric: 

            # of Successfully Completed Sessions  
   SCR % = ---------------------------------------  
                  Total # of Session Requests      
    

3.11.1. Successful Session Completion 

   A session completes successfully when it begins with a setup request 
   and ends with a session completion message. 

   The following dialog [4] provides an example describing the necessary 
   events of a successful session completion:

3.11.2. Failed Session Completion 

   Session completion fails when an INVITE is sent from a UAC, but there 
   is no indication the INVITE reached the intended UAS.  This can also 
   occur if the intended UAS does not respond to the UAC or the response 
   never reaches the UAC associated with the session. 

   The following dialog provides an example describing the necessary 
   events of an unsuccessful session completion:

3.12. Session Success Rate (SSR) 

   Session success rate is defined as the percentage of successfully 
   completed sessions compared to sessions, which fail due to ISA or 
   SDF.  This metric is also known as Call Success Rate (CSR) in

   telephony applications of SIP.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage of 
   successful sessions.  The following represents the calculation for 
   this metric: 

   SSR = 100% - (ISA% + SDF%) 

4. Metric Correlations 

   These metrics may be used to determine the performance of a domain 
   and/or user.  This would be to provide a metric relative to one or 
   more dimensions.  The following is a subset of dimensions for 
   providing further granularity per metric: 

        . To "user" 

        . From "user" 

        . Bi-direction "user" 

        . To "domain" 

        . From "domain" 

        . Bi-direction "domain" 

5. Additional Considerations 

5.1. Back-to-back User Agent (B2BUA) 

   A B2BUA may impact the ability to collect these metrics with an end-
   to-end perspective.  It is necessary to realize a B2BUA may act as an 
   originating UAC and terminating UAS or it may act as a proxy.  In 
   some cases, it may be necessary to consider information collected 
   from both sides of the B2BUA in order to determine the end-to-end 
   perspective.  In other cases, the B2BUA may act simply as a proxy 
   allowing data to be derived as necessary for the input into any of 
   the listed calculations. 

5.2. Authorization and Authentication 

   During the process of setting up a SIP dialog, various authentication 
   methods may be utilized.  These authentication methods will add to 
   the duration as measured by the metrics, and the length of time will 
   vary based on those methods.  The failures of these authentication 
   methods will also be captured by these metrics, since SIP is 
   ultimately used to indicate the success or failure of the 
   authorization and/or authentication attempt.  The metrics in section 
   3 are inclusive of the duration associated with this process, even if

   the method is external to the SIP protocol.  This was included 
   purposefully, due to its inherent impact on the protocol and the 
   subsequent SIP dialogs. 

5.3. Forking 

   Forking should be considered when determining the messages associated 
   with the input values for the described metrics.  If all of the 
   forked dialogs were used in the metric calculations, the numbers 
   would skew dramatically.  There are two different points of forking, 
   which must be considered.  First, forking may occur at a proxy 
   downstream from the UAC that is being used for metric input values. 
   Since, the downstream proxy is responsible for forking a message and 
   then only sending the accepted response to the UAC, the UAC will only 
   see messages as indicated in the described metrics.  Second, in the 
   cases where the observed UAC or proxy is forking the messages, then 
   it must utilize the first INVITE or set of INVITE messages sent and 
   the first accepted 200 OK.  A tag will identify this dialog as 
   distinct from the other 200 OK responses, which are acknowledged and 
   an immediate BYE is sent.  The application responsible for capturing 
   and/or understanding the input values must utilize this tag to 
   distinguish between dialogs. 

5.4. Data Collection 

   The input necessary for these calculations may be collected in a 
   number of different manners.  It may be collected or retrieved from 
   call detail records (CDR) or raw signaling information generated by a 
   proxy or UA.  When using records, time synchronization must be 
   considered between applicable elements. 

   The information may also be transmitted through the use of network 
   management protocols like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
   [RFC 1157] and via future extensions to the SIP Management 
   Information Base (MIB) modules [6], or through a potential undefined 
   new performance metric event package [3] retrieved via SUBSCRIBE 
   requests. 

   Data may be collected for a sample of calls or all calls, and may 
   also be derived from test call scenarios.  These metrics are flexible 
   based on the needs of the application. 

5.5. Testing Documentation 

   In some cases, these metrics will be used to provide output values to 
   signify the performance level of a specific SIP-based element.  When 
   using these metrics in a test environment, the environment must be 
   accurately documented for the purposes of replicating any output 
   values in future testing and/or validation.

5.6. Metric Template 

   Although, this document provides details for a foundational set of 
   pertinent metrics, other metrics may be necessary as the SIP protocol 
   evolves or as deemed necessary by an individual or set of companies 
   and/or vendors.  This section details a template, which should be 
   used when creating new performance metrics.  This template will allow 
   for a common structure of information, which will enable a more 
   adaptable method of understanding and incorporating metrics defined 
   beyond the scope of this document. 

   All metrics should include the following characteristics: 

        . A metric should have a common 2-4 word summary description, 
          which can be identified as a 2-4 letter acronym. 

        . The metric must describe the problem or motivation for which 
          it is attempting to detect or identify. 

        . The metric must describe what is measured as indicated 
          specifically by defined SIP messages. 

        . The metric must identify the unit(s) of measure described in 
          the associated output. 

        . The metric must define the time at which the inputs are 
          captured, including both beginning and end. 

        . The metric must describe if the outputs can be utilized in a 
          manner other than the raw output (e.g. average, high/low, 
          etc.), and if so, how. 

6. Security Considerations 

   Security should be considered in the aspect of securing the relative 
   data utilized in providing input to the above calculations.  All 
   other aspects of security should be considered as described in [2].   

7. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations at this time. 

8. Conclusions 

   The proposed guideline provides a description of common performance 
   metrics, and their defined use with SIP.  The use of these metrics 
   will provide a common viewpoint across all vendors, service 
   providers, and customers.  These metrics will likely be utilized in 
   production SIP environments for providing input regarding Key

   Performance Indicators (KPI) and Service Level Agreement (SLA)
