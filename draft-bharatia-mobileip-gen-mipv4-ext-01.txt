Abstract 

   IP Mobility support for IPv4 [RFC3344] defines a short and skippable 
   extension header format intended to extend the Mobile IP extension 
   address space. Based on the format presented in [RFC3344], this 
   draft defines a Mobile IP extension for configuration options, which 
   SHOULD be used by any Mobile IP entity to exchange information of 
   the network entities like DNS server address, previous Foreign Agent 
   (FA) address, address of a session manager etc. 

1  Introduction 

   This draft uses short and skippable extension header format defined 
   by [RFC3344] and offers a generalized solution to exchange 
   information like address of DNS server, address of previous FA 
   and/or address of a session manager etc.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3  Mobile IP Extension for Configuration Options Exchange 

   The Mobile IP extension SHALL have the format shown in this section 
   to carry information like IPv4 address. Note that this extension MAY 
   be included as a part of Mobile IP Registration Request. If this 
   extension is requested in the Registration Request, the network 
   entity (mentioned in the Entity-Type field) SHOULD provide requested 
   information in the Registration Reply. If multiple Sub-Types are 
   needed in the same message, the configuration options header SHOULD 
   be repeated for each Sub-Type.

   Type 
       IPV4-CONF-OPTIONS-EXT-TYPE=TBD. This extension value will be 
       assigned by IANA from the numbering space defined in [RFC3344] 
       for skippable extensions. 
   Length 
       Represents 8-bit unsigned integer (in octets). Length of the 
       extension includes the extension type and the extension Length 
       fields. This field MUST be set to 1 plus the total length of the 
       Data and Entity-Type fields. 
    
   Sub-Type 
       This field describes the type of entity, whose information is 
       requested from the network entities (mentioned in Entity-Type 
       field) when used in a configuration options extension for 
       Registration Request. But it describes the type of entity, whose 
       information is included in Data field when used in a 
       configuration options extension for Registration Reply. 
       Currently the following types are defined: 

       PRIMARY-DNS = TBD 
       SECONDARY-DNS = TBD 
       PREVIOUS-FOREIGN-AGENT = TBD

       SESSION-MANAGER = TBD 
       DHCP            = TBD 
    
   Entity-Type 
       This field in a configuration options extension for Registration 
       Request includes the type of the network entity from whom the 
       information is requested. When this field is included in the 
       configuration options extension for Registration Reply, it 
       refers to the network entity that inserts the Data field. 
       Currently the following types are defined:

       HOME-AGENT = TBD 
       FOREIGN-AGENT = TBD 
       HAAA = TBD 
       VAAA = TBD 
    
   Data 
       This field is inserted in a Registration Reply by the network 
	   entity mentioned in the Entity-Type of the Registration 
	   Request. This field represents the data of the network entity 
	   mentioned in the Sub-Type.  

4  Processing of Configuration Options Extension 

   When a network entity (mentioned in the extension format of 
   the Entity-Type) adds a configuration options extension to a 
   Registration Request or Registration Reply message, this extension 
   MUST appear prior to any authentication extensions added by that 
   entity. 

5  IANA Considerations 

   This draft defines new Mobile IPv4 extension of types IPV4-CONF-
   OPTIONS-EXT-TYPE as defined in section 3 of this document. This 
   value MUST be assigned by IANA from the Mobile IP numbering space 
   for skippable extensions. Additionally, unique values MUST be 
   assigned to each member of the Sub-Type and Entity-Type fields. 

6  Security Considerations 

   There are no additional security aspects imposed by this document in 
   addition to the one defined in [RFC3344].
