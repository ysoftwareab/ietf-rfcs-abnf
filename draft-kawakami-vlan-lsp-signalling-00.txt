Abstract 
   This document describes a method to set up a Layer 2 tunnel over 
   Ethernet-based networks. For this purpose, the ports of an Ethernet 
   switch are configured to forward VLAN tag-labeled frames incoming 
   from a certain port to another unambiguous port by using only the 
   VLAN tag information. The Ethernet switches form the transport plane 
   and are a part of Label Switching Routers (LSRs). In the control 
   plane the VLAN tags are distribute using Label Distribution Protocol 
   (LDP) and Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-
   TE). To enable LDP and RSVP-TE to fulfil that function, this document 
   proposes extensions in these protocols. The introduced method 
   simplifies the control and management of wide area Ethernet networks 
   and limits the distribution of broadcast/multicast frames.

1.  Introduction 
    
   In this document, a method is presented that automatically sets up 
   Layer 2 (L2) tunnel through Ethernet switches. At the tunnel ingress 
   point the packets are labeled with VLAN tag(s), as defined in [5], 
   and the forwarding through the Ethernet switches is done according to 
   the VLAN tag value. The Ethernet switches on the other hand are 
   merely one part of the Label Switching Routers (LSRs). To set up a L2 
   tunnel, also called VLAN Label Switch Path (VLAN-LSP) in this 
   document, the VLAN tags are distributed throughout Label Switched 
   Routers (LSRs). The main purpose of this document is to propose 
   extensions of the signalling protocols in order to enable 
   establishing and maintaining of L2 tunnels by distributing VLAN tags. 
   In particular extensions of (1) LDP to set up hop-by-hop tunnels and 
   (2) RSVP-TE to use the advantages of explicit routing are proposed.

   Further, Section 1 describes the motivation of developing a new 
   transport method over VLAN-aware Ethernet switches and presents the 
   architecture of the network. Section 2 specifies some terms of the 
   used terminology. Sections 3, 4 and 5 describe the characteristics of 
   the LSRs as well as of the LSP management. Sections 6 and 7 provide 
   the main contribution of this document - definition of new label TLV 
   in the LDP protocol and new objects in the RSVP-TE protocol. 
    
1.1 Motivation 
    
   The Ethernet technology is widely deployed for Local Area Networks 
   (LAN) since couple of years. Recently, due to appearance of high-
   speed, long distance and broadband Ethernet technology, Ethernet is 
   applied to Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) and Wide Area Networks 
   (WAN) as well. In this document, the use of Ethernet in MAN/WAN 
   networks is described as wide area Ethernet. 
    
   One application gaining more importance in the last time is the 
   employment of Ethernet by service provider in the access network, 
   e.g. connecting (1) a subscriber and an Internet Service Provider 
   (ISP) or (2) several private LANs. The extension of L1/L2 Ethernet 
   services to be provided in the access network is a subject of [11]. 
   However, some problems occur when LAN-Ethernet is extended to wide 
   area Ethernet. First, the provider equipment should manage a great 
   number of users, which would result in hardly scalable network. 
   Second, it is necessary to limit the distribution of the broadcast 
   packets generated by the users in order to avoid the undesirable 
   flooding. To avoid these disadvantages we propose a simple solution 
   for point-to-point tunnelling of Ethernet packets over wide area 
   Ethernet networks, assuring that all packets between the two entities 
   follow the same predetermined path. Our method is based on the use of 
   VLAN tags as labels, which determine unambiguous the outgoing port of 
   all Ethernet switches along the path. 
    
   There are ongoing standardisation activities in [10] aiming to extend 
   existing Ethernet protocols for better performance in wide area 
   Ethernet, which include distributed control and management. Unlike to 
   this approaches, the method proposed in this document employs GMPLS 
   control protocols (LDP and RSVP-TE) for signalling the information 
   needed to configure the switching equipment.  
    
   Basically VLAN networks, as introduced in [5], use the concept of 
   building groups of users, which are placed in different network 
   domains, in such order that the broadcast traffic is exchanged only 
   between the members of the group. If this concept is applied for the 
   method proposed in this document, a group between two entities (e.g.

   subscriber and ISP or LAN-LAN connection) is formed, and thus, all 
   the traffic generated by these entities is distributed only between 
   them. This method can be generically called a "set up of LSP over 
   Ethernet using VLAN tag switching", where the LSP is understood as a 
   point-to-point path between two entities. Introducing this method the 
   high-speed and broadband network services between a user and an ISP 
   can be achieved economically. 
    
1.2 Network Architecture 
    
   The proposed method of setting up LSP over Ethernet using VLAN tag 
   switching can be realised as one network, in which the information is 
   transported in two independent planes. In this document they are 
   referred as forwarding plane and control plane. The forwarding plane 
   assures the reliable L2 switching of data packets over network and 
   uses the forwarding component of VLAN-LSR (a definition of VLAN-LSR 
   is given in Section 2). The control plane deals with the LSP setting 
   and management, as either LDP or RSVP-TE are used for label 
   distribution. Further a network management entity, called Network 
   Manager, calculates the paths (VLAN-LSP) and it can control the 
   network load. Note that the Network Manager is needed only if RSVP-TE 
   is used for label distribution.

   Forwarding plane: 
   A standard VLAN-aware Ethernet switch is used as a forwarding 
   component of the VLAN-LSR, and thus, the MAC address and the VLAN tag 
   are used for the data packet switching. However, applying the method 
   proposed in this document, the switching is determined by the VLAN 
   tag applied at the ingress node of the L2 tunnel. Therefore the VLAN 
   tag is referred as a label and the data path can be called LSP or 
   more precisely VLAN-LSP as defined in Section 2.

   The control plane does the configuration of the forwarding plane 
   automatically. More detailed description of the functions and 
   characteristics in the forwarding plane is given in Section 3. 
    
   Control plane: 
   The VLAN-LSP setting and management is done in the control plane by 
   the control component of VLAN-LSR. The VLAN-LSP setting can be 
   achieved in two ways: explicit path for traffic engineering, (using 
   RSVP-TE) and hop-by-hop setting (using standard LDP). The control 
   (i.e. LDP or RSVP-TE) packets are processed by Layer 3 in the control 
   component of the VLAN-LSR. Each control component of VLAN-LSR has at 
   least 1 IP address, which is used for routing the control packets. 
    
   More detailed description of the procedures in the control plane is 
   given in Section 5. The label distribution technique described here 
   is referred according to [3] as downstream on demand with ordered 
   control. 
    
   Using a standard Ethernet switch as a forwarding component leads to 
   two main differences to the MPLS concept: 
   -  the label-switching is not performed using only one label but 
      using MAC address and VLAN tag; 
   -  label swapping at the LSR cannot be performed. 
    
   With respect to other characteristics of the generic MPLS idea, the 
   proposed method could be observed as implementing MPLS concept over 
   Ethernet. For instance, the transmission is executed in L2, so it 
   depends on neither the network layer protocol nor the address system. 
   Further, by managing VLAN-LSP configuration aggregately, the path can 
   be configured and managed freely in order to perform traffic 
   engineering. 
    
   VLAN-LSP could find a broad application from Carriers and ISPs, the 
   networks of which are based on wide area Ethernet technology, as for 
   instance, a connection between user and ISP or a L2VPN over an 
   Ethernet access network. 
    
    
2.  Definitions 
    
   A LSR is a device which implements the label switching control and 
   forwarding component described in [3]. 
    
   A VLAN-LSR is an LSR with a number of Ethernet interfaces, which 
   forwards frames between these interfaces, using labels carried in the 
   VLAN tag. The structure of the VLAN-LSR is depicted in Figure 2.

   Control packets (e.g. LDP or RSVP-TE messages) are distributed using 
   L3 routing, which is performed by the VLAN-LSRs. 
    
   A VLAN-LSR domain is a set of VLAN-LSRs which are mutually 
   interconnected by Ethernet interfaces. 
    
   An Edge VLAN-LSR is a VLAN-LSR that connects the VLAN-LSR domain with 
   a node, which is outside of the domain.

   Ethernet interface is a standard Ethernet interface used to transport 
   data and control packets. 
    
   The control interface connects control component and forwarding 
   component. Transport of control (LDP or RSVP-TE) packets and 
   configuration of the forwarding plane are performed over this 
   interface. The control interface can consist of several logical 
   and/or physical interfaces. 
    
   Forwarding component is a VLAN-aware Ethernet switch. Its ports can 
   be configured automatically through the control interface. Forwarding 
   component performs label switching, which is accomplished by using 
   the label value to forward packets.  
    
   Control component is a device implementing the LDP, resp. RSVP-TE, 
   protocol and performing IP routing. After receiving and analysing a 
   label distribution (LDP/RSVP-TE) packet, the control component 
   generates a new label distribution packet and configures the ports of 
   the forwarding component through the control interface. 
    
   VLAN-LSP is a path through one or more forwarding components of VLAN-
   LSRs that is followed by VLAN tag labeled packets. Since the label-
   switched path (LSP) is completely defined by the VLAN tag applied at 
   the ingress edge VLAN-LSR and no label swapping function is

   performed, the VLAN-LSP can be treated as tunnel. When a VLAN-LSP is 
   used in this way, we refer to it as bi-directional. 
    
   Employing VLAN tag switching, the label is carried in the VID field 
   of the VLAN tag (see Section 4). Since the forwarding component 
   should distinguish between control and data packets, it is necessary 
   to introduce two types of VLAN tags: control and forwarding tag. They 
   are classified according the VID value. 
    
   Control tag is a VLAN tag, the VID value of which is in a certain 
   range configured by the network operator. The range of VID values of 
   the control tag can be configured freely, as long as there is no 
   overlap with the forwarding tag values. The control tag is used for 
   switching of control packets, i.e. routing packets or LDP/RSVP-TE 
   packets. 
    
   Forwarding tag is a VLAN tag, the VID value of which is not in the 
   range of the control tag values. The forwarding tag is used for 
   switching the data packets over the Ethernet interface.  
    
   In addition, this document uses the terminology defined in [3]. 
    
    
3.  VLAN Tag Switching (Forwarding Plane) 
    
   The task of the forwarding plane is to transport the data packets 
   along a VLAN-LSP between two Edge VLAN-LSRs. This transport is 
   achieved through VLAN tag switching in the forwarding component of 
   the VLAN-LSR. According to the functionality of the forwarding 
   component, it can be classified in 2 groups: forwarding component of 
   edge VLAN-LSR and forwarding component of internal VLAN-LSR.  
    
   Comparing the method proposed in this document and the MPLS concept, 
   some differences can be highlighted. This document does not specify 
   the following cases: 
   -  point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point LSPs; 
   -  the LSRs use LSP merge. 
   However, some opportunities to specify the above cases exist and 
   could be a subject of future works. 
    
   Using a standard VLAN tag as label, no Time-to-Live (TTL) counter is 
   supported in the Layer 2 header. Such TTL counter is present merely 
   in the IP header, which is not manipulated by the forwarding 
   component, and therefore, "TTL-decrement" function cannot be 
   supported in the forwarding plane. An option to support "TTL-
   decrement" function could be found in Section 4.

3.1 Forwarding Component of Edge VLAN-LSR 
    
   By receiving a data packet, the forwarding component of ingress edge 
   VLAN-LSR assigns this packet to a VLAN-LSP and inserts a VLAN tag 
   with VID corresponding to VLAN-LSP Identifier (LSPID) in the Ethernet 
   header as it is shown in Section 4. Then, the labeled packet is 
   switched based on the VID to a port corresponding to this VID. When 
   the labeled packet arrives at the egress edge VLAN-LSR, it is 
   switched to the corresponding port and the VLAN tag is removed before 
   the packet leaves the VLAN-LSR domain.  
    
3.2 Forwarding Component of internal VLAN-LSR 
    
   The forwarding component analyses the VID of the incoming labeled 
   data packets. Depending on the value of the VID, the packet is 
   switched to a port belonging to the LSP ID of the packet.  
    
   While the MPLS architecture permits considerable flexibility in LSR 
   implementation, a VLAN-LSR is constrained by the capabilities of the 
   pre-existing hardware and the restrictions of the VLAN tag format as 
   defined in [5]. Since the forwarding component is a VLAN-aware 
   Ethernet switch, the VID field of the labeled packet remains 
   unchanged on the whole VLAN-LSP, and therefore, the label swapping 
   function cannot be performed. 
    
    
4.  Encapsulation 
    
   The procedures described in this section affect only the Edge VLAN-
   LSRs. The internal VLAN-LSRs themselves do not modify the 
   encapsulation in any way. The description of the encapsulation in 
   this section is fully conformant with the encapsulation proposed in 
   [5].

   The VLAN tag consists of TPID field (0x8100), which identifies the 
   VLAN tag, and TCI field, which contains the control information.  
    
   The label value is encoded into the VID field. Having a 12 bit VID 
   field, 4096 different labels are available, but since some of the 
   labels are reserved, about 4000 VLAN-LSPs could be set over the VLAN-
   LSR domain. To increase the number of connections over the VLAN-LSR 
   domain, VLAN tag stacking could be proposed, as the upper VLAN tag is 
   used for the packet switching (performing VLAN-LSP) and the lower 
   VLAN tag is used for mapping several connections over one VLAN-LPS. 
   However, the standardisation of VLAN tag stacking is not in the 
   responsibility of IETF. 
    
   Using a standard VLAN tag as label, no TTL filed is present in the 
   Layer 2 header, and therefore, "TTL-decrement" function cannot be 
   supported in the forwarding plane, i.e. along the VLAN-LSP. However, 
   such TTL counter is available in the IP header, which is not 
   manipulated by the forwarding component, but using the hop count 
   option as defined in [6] and [9], the "TTL decrement" function could 
   be performed in the egress edge VLAN-LSR.

   The Pri field in VLAN tag identifies the user priority of the packet 
   and could be used similarly as Exp field described in [4]. 
    
    
5.  Label Distribution and Maintenance (Control Plane) 
    
   In this section, primarily label allocation, distribution, and 
   maintenance procedures are described. These procedures are performed 
   by the control component of the VLAN-LSR.  
    
   In general, label distribution is done by a number of different 
   mechanisms, notably the LDP [6], Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and 
   RSVP-TE [10]. In this document, it is assumed that the label bindings 
   are distributed only by LDP and/or RSVP-TE. Below, certain 
   requirements on these two protocols are described. A support of VLAN 
   tag switching does NOT require from the VLAN-LSR to support the VLAN 
   control component defined by the IEEE (e.g., STP, GARPI). 
    
   This document discusses the use of "downstream-on-demand with ordered 
   control" label distribution (see [6]) by VLAN-LSRs. These label 
   distribution procedures MUST be used in the control component of 
   VLAN-LSR. First we describe the behaviour of the control component of 
   the edge VLAN-LSR and afterwards of the internal VLAN-LSR. 
    
5.1 Control Component of Edge VLAN-LSR 
    
   A VLAN-LSP MUST be configured by the control components of all VLAN-
   LSRs along the path before starting to forward data packets. For this 
   purpose, the Network Manager (see Figure 1) calculates the VLAN-LSP 
   and the further steps for setting up the VLAN-LSP depend on the used 
   signalling protocol. If LDP is used, the Network Manager (NM) sends 
   to the ingress LSR the IP address of the egress VLAN-LSR. Afterwards 
   the VLAN-LSP can be set up employing the routing tables of the VLAN-
   LSRs and knowing the IP address of the egress VLAN-LSR. On the other 
   hand, if RSVP-TE with EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) is used, the NM 
   sends a list of IP addresses to the ingress edge VLAN-LSR. This list 
   contains the IP addresses of the control components of all VLAN-LSRs, 
   which construct the path. The ingress edge VLAN-LSR uses RSVP-TE 
   signalling protocol to send Path message with LABEL_REQUEST and 
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE objects to the VLAN-LSR having the next IP address in 
   the ERO. 
    
   Once the control component of the edge VLAN-LSR receives the Label 
   Mapping Message (LDP)/Resv Message (RSVP-TE), it configures the 
   forwarding component. To forward data packets along a VLAN-LSP, the 
   forwarding component of ingress VLAN-LSR SHOULD insert a VLAN tag in 
   the Ethernet header. Respectively, the egress VLAN-LSR SHOULD forward

   the packet according to the VID and remove the VLAN tag before the 
   packet leave the VLAN-LSR domain.  
    
   There are two possibilities to decide how to determine the VLAN tag: 
    
   (1) Using RSVP-TE 
       The use of RSVP-TE offers another two possibilities to determine 
       the VLAN tag to be inserted in the incoming data packets. It 
       depends which message type is used for signalling the VID: 
       - If the Path message is used, then the VID for the VLAN tag is 
         derived from SENDER_TEMPLATE object using its "LSP ID" field. 
         More precisely, the "LSP ID" field has length of 16 bit, while 
         the VID field is only 12-bit long, and therefore, the VID is 
         encoded right justified in bits 20-31 (see section 7.3). 
         Having this in mind, the network management system (i.e. 
         Network Manager) sets the "LSP ID" field in such manner that 
         the last 12 bits of this field are a unique identifier of the 
         VLAN-LSP connection for the whole VLAN-LSR domain. 
       - If the Resv message is employed, then the control component may 
         use the LABEL object to determine the VID for the VLAN tag. In 
         this case the VID is encoded right justified in bits 20-31 as 
         defined in section 7.1. 
       
   (2) Using LDP 
       Since no unambiguous VLAN-LSP identificator (like "LSP-ID") is 
       available, only the egress VLAN-LSR MUST determine the VID value 
       in the VLAN tag.. Thus, in order to avoid overlapping of the VID 
       values because a number of egress VLAN-LSRs can be present in 
       the network, each egress VLAN-LSRs should require that value 
       from the Network Manager. The Network Manager distributes the 
       VID value to the egress VLAN-LSR using a newly specified "VLAN 
       Label TLV" (see section 6) in the Label Mapping Message. 
    
   To achieve the data forwarding along a certain VALN-LSP, the control 
   component configures the forwarding component (i.e. Ethernet switch) 
   as sending to it information for data packet classification, which 
   includes input port number, VID value of the VLAN tag and output port 
   number. Since the VLAN-LSP is bi-directional, the edge VLAN-LSRs of a 
   given VLAN-LSP perform the functions of both ingress and egress LSR. 
    
5.2 Control Component of Internal VLAN-LSR 
    
   The functionalities of the control component of an internal VLAN-LSR 
   depend on the used signalling protocol. Below the procedures for 
   RSVP-TE and LDP are described.

5.2.1 Using RSVP-TE 
 
   It is assumed that the RSVP-TE signalling is used together with 
   explicit routing, which means with ERO object. When an internal VLAN-
   LSR receives a Path Message for a certain VLAN-LSP from a connected 
   peer, it takes the following actions: 
    
   1. it allocates a label (VID) from the "LSP ID" field of 
     SENDER_TEMPLATE object. This means if the bits 20-31 of the "LSP 
     ID" field are set, then the control component configures the input 
     port of the forwarding component binding that port with the VID 
     value. 
    
   2. it sends a request to the next VLAN-LSR. That means a Path Message 
     with LABEL_REQUEST object and SENDER_TEMPLATE object is send to 
     the VLAN-LSR with next IP address from the ERO. 
 
   3. after a Resv message is received from the downstream VLAN-LSR and 
     the LABEL object is present, the control component configures the 
     correspondent port of the forwarding component with the VID value.  
    
   Whenever a VLAN-LSR originates a Path Message to its downstream LSR 
   as a result of receiving a Path Message from another (upstream) LSR, 
   and the request is not satisfied, the VLAN-LSR SHOULD destroy the 
   binding created in response to the received request, and notify its 
   requester. 
    
5.2.2 Using LDP 
 
   If LDP is used as signalling protocol, it MUST be configured in 
   ingress-initiated downstream-on-demand with ordered control label 
   distribution mode (as defined in [3] and [6]). The label for the 
   VLAN-LSP (i.e. the VID) is distributed from the egress VLAN-LSR to 
   the ingress VLAN-LSR. Therefore, a Label Request Message is send 
   consequently from the ingress VLAN-LSR to the egress VLAN-LSR through 
   the internal VLAN-LSRs in hop-by-hop basis. When an internal VLAN-LSR 
   receives a Label Request Message, it takes the following actions: 
    
   1. it sends a Label Request Message to the next downstream VLAN-LSR. 
    
   2. subsequently to the request, it receives a Label Mapping Message 
     from the downstream VLAN-LSR, which contains the "VLAN Label TLV" 
     proposed in section 6. Then the control component allocates a 
     label (VID) determined from the VLAN Label TLV's VID field and 
     configures the forwarding component.

   3. it returns a Label Mapping Message back to upstream VLAN-LSR peer 
     that originated the initial request. 
    
   Note: When two VLAN-LSPs are completely separated in the domain (two 
   LSPs never passes the same VLAN-LSR), as long as managing with the 
   network management function, the same label (first 12 bits of "LSP 
   ID" field of SENDER_TEMPLATE object) MAY be used for these two VLAN-
   LSPs. 
    
    
   Whenever a VLAN-LSR originates a Label Request Message to its next 
   hop LSR as a result of receiving a Label Request Message from another 
   (upstream) LSR, and the request to the next hop LSR is not satisfied, 
   the VLAN-LSR SHOULD destroy the binding created in response to the 
   received request, and notify the requester. 
    
   When a VLAN-LSR determines that it has lost its LDP session with 
   another LSR, the following actions are taken. Any binding information 
   learned via this connection MUST be discarded. For any label bindings 
   that were created as a result of receiving Label Request Message from 
   the peer, the LSR MAY destroy these bindings (and release labels 
   associated with these binding). 
    
    
6.  LDP Extension with new VLAN Label TLV 
    
   In this section, a LDP extension is proposed in order to enable the 
   control components of VLAN-LSRs to communicate the necessary 
   information to set up VLAN-LSP. This LDP extension includes the 
   definition of a new Label TLV, called VLAN Label TLV, which is 
   distributed by the Label Mapping Message. 
    
   Applying the VID field of VLAN tag as a label for switching in the 
   forwarding plane, the forwarding component must be correspondingly 
   configured by the control component in the VLAN-LSR. Since the 
   communication between the control components is performed by LDP, it 
   is REQUIRED that the VID information is encoded in the LDP packets. 
   To achieve this requirement, the VLAN Label TLV is specified as 
   follows:

       Specifies the length of the Value field in octets.

   In the control component, the handling of the VLAN label TLV in the 
   included in the Label Mapping Message is described in Section 5. 
    
    
7.  RSVP-TE Extension 
    
   In this section, RSVP-TE extensions are proposed in order to enable 
   the control components of VLAN-LSRs to communicate the necessary 
   information to set up VLAN-LSP. These RSVP-TE extensions include the 
   extensions for VLAN tag in the LABEL and LABEL_REQUEST objects. 
   Further, a definition for the "LSP" ID field in the SENDER_TEMPLATE 
   abject is provided in Section 7.3. As it is specified in [9] Section 
   3.1, both SENDER_TEMPLATE object and LABEL_REQUEST object should be 
   presented in the Path message.

7.1 Label Object 
    
   The format of the LABEL object is as defined in [9] Section 4.1: 
    
   LABEL class = 16, C_Type = 1 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   The content of a LABEL is a single label, encoded in 4 octets. To 
   allow the transport of VLAN tag's VID, which has the length of 12 
   bits, the VID is encoded right justified in bits 20-31. The preceding 
   bits 0-19 should be set to zero on transmission and ignored on 
   receipt.  
    
   In the control component of the VLAN-LSR, the handling of the VID 
   encoded in the LABEL object on receipt of Resv message is described 
   in Section 5. 
    
    
7.2 Label Request Object 
    
   The Label Request Class is 19 as defined in [9] Section 4.2. 
   Currently there are three possible C_types. We would like to define a 
   new C_Type = 4, which is a label request with a VLAN tag label range. 
   The LABEL_REQUEST object with a VLAN tag label range format is shown 
   below: 
    
   Class = 19 , C_Type = 4 (actually, will be allocated by IANA) 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

   L3PID 
       an identifier of the layer 3 protocol using this path. Standard 
       Ethertype values are used. 
    
   Minimum VID 
       This 12-bit field specifies the lower bound of a block of VLAN 
       ID that is supported on the originating switch. 
    
   Maximum VID 
       This 12-bit field specifies the upper bound of a block of VLAN 
       ID that is supported on the originating switch. 
    
    
7.3 Sender Template Object 
    
   The SENDER_TEMPLATE object might have two different formats 
   depending of the IP version as defined in [9] Section 4.6.2. In both 
   cases the "LSP ID" field is 16 bits long. The 12 bits long VLAN tag's 
   VID is encoded right justified in bits 20-31. The preceding bits 16-
   19 should be set to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt. The 
   formats of the SENDER_TEMPLATE object are shown below: 
    
   1) Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 7 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

   IPv6 tunnel sender address 
       IPv6 address for a sender node 
    
   LSP ID 
       A 16-bit identifier used in the SENDER_TEMPLATE and the 
       FILTER_SPEC that can be changed to allow a sender to share 
       resources with itself. 
    
   The handling of the VID encoded in the SENDER_TEMPLATE object's "LSP 
   ID" field on receipt of the Path message is described in Section 5. 
    
    
8.  IANA Considerations 
    
   Two values have to be assigned by IANA for this document: 
    
   One new label type for VLAN Label TLV (suggested label type = 
   0x0203), which is defined in Section 6. 
    
   One new RSVP C_Type for the LABEL_REQUEST object (Class = 19, 
   suggested C_Type = 4), which is defined in Section 7.2. 
    
    
9.  Security Considerations 
    
   The encapsulation and procedures specified in this document do not 
   interfere in any way with the application of authentication and/or 
   encryption to network layer packets (such as the application of IPSEC 
   to IP diagrams)

   The procedures described in this document do not protect against the 
   alternation (either accidental or malicious) of the MPLS labels. Such 
   alternation could cause misforwarding. 
    
   The procedures described in this document do not enable a receiving 
   VLAN-LSR to authenticate the transmitting VLAN-LSR.  
    
   A discussion on the security considerations applicable to the label 
   distribution mechanism can be found in [6]. 
    
    
10. Intellectual Property Considerations 
    
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
   has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on the 
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11. Copies of 
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances 
   of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made 
   to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification 
   can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice 
   this standard. Please address the information to the IETF Executive 
   Director.
