  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking           April 2003
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

     1. Introduction

     This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of
     devices that implement traffic control based on IP precedence or
     diff-serv code point criteria.

     New terminology is needed because most existing measurements
     assume the absence of congestion and only a single per-hop-
     behavior. This document introduces several new terms that will
     allow measurements to be taken during periods of congestion.

     Another key difference from existing terminology is the definition
     of measurements as observed on egress as well as ingress of a
     device/system under test. Again, the existence of congestion
     requires the addition of egress measurements as well as those
     taken on ingress; without observing traffic leaving a
     device/system it is not possible to say whether traffic-control
     mechanisms effectively dealt with congestion.

     The principal measurements introduced in this document are vectors
     for rate, delay, and jitter, all of which can be observed with or
     without congestion of the DUT/SUT.

     This document describes only those terms relevant to measuring
     behavior of a device or a group of devices using one of these two
     mechanisms. End-to-end and service-level measurements are beyond
     the scope of this document.


     2.  Existing definitions

     RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect
     Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
     Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this
     document.

     RFC 2474 "Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS
     Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers" section 2, contains
     discussions of a number of terms relevant to network-layer traffic
     control mechanisms and should also be consulted.

     For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the
     template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.
     Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease
     of reference.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
     RFC 2119.

     3. Term definitions

     3.1 Configuration Terms


     3.1.1 Classification

        Definition:
          Selection of packets based on the contents of packet header
          according to defined rules.

        Discussion:
          Packets can be selected based on the DS field or IP
          Precedence in the packet header.  Classification can also be
          based on Multi-Field (MF) criteria such as IP Source and
          destination addresses, protocol and port number.

          Classification determines the per-hop behaviors and traffic
          conditioning functions such as shaping and dropping that are
          to be applied to the packet.


        Measurement units:
           n/a

        See Also:


     3.1.2 Codepoint Set

        Definition:
          The set of all DS Code-points or IP precedence values used
          during the test duration.

        Discussion:
          Describes all the code-point markings associated with packets
          that are input to the DUT/SUT.  For each entry in the
          codepoint set, there are associated vectors describing the
          rate of traffic, delay, loss, or jitter containing that
          particular DSCP or IP precedence value.

          The treatment that a packet belonging to a particular code-
          point gets is subject to the DUT classifying packets to map
          to the correct PHB. Moreover, the forwarding treatment in
          general is also dependent on the complete set of offered
          vectors.

     3.1.3 Forwarding Congestion

        Definition:
          A condition in which one or more egress interfaces are
          offered more packets than are forwarded.

        Discussion:

          This condition is a superset of the overload definition
          [Ma98]. The overload discussion deals with how many input
          interfaces are required to overload the output interfaces.
          Forwarding congestion does not assume ingress interface
          overload as the only source of overload on output interfaces.

          Another difference between Forwarding Congestion and overload
          occurs when the SUT comprises multiple elements, in that
          Forwarding Congestion may occur at multiple points. Consider
          an SUT comprising multiple edge devices exchanging traffic
          with a single core device. Depending on traffic patterns, the
          edge devices may induce Forwarding Congestion on multiple
          egress interfaces on the core device.

          Packet Loss, not increased Delay, is the metric to indicate
          the condition of Forwarding Congestion.  Packet Loss is a
          deterministic indicator of Forwarding Congestion.  While
          increased delay may be an indicator of Forwarding Congestion,
          it is a non-deterministic indicator of Forwarding Congestion.
          External observation of increased delay to indicate
          congestion is in effect external observation of Incipient
          Congestion. [Ra99] states that it is impractical to build a
          black-box test to externally observe Incipient Congestion in
          a router.  For the purpose of "black-box" testing a DUT/SUT,
          Packet Loss as the indicator of Forwarding Congestion is
          used.

          Throughput [Br91] defines the lower boundary of Forwarding
          Congestion.  Throughput is the maximum offered rate with no
          Forwarding Congestion. At offered rates above throughput, the
          DUT/SUT is considered to be in a state of Forwarding
          Congestion.

          Ingress observations alone are not sufficient to cover all
          cases in which Forwarding Congestion may occur. A device with
          an infinite amount of memory could buffer an infinite amount
          of packets, and eventually forward all of them. However,
          these packets may or may not be forwarded during the test
          duration. Even though ingress interfaces accept all packets
          without loss, Forwarding Congestion is present in this
          hypothetical device.

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          Forwarding Congestion, indicated by occurrence of packet
          loss, is one type of congestion for a DUT/SUT.  Congestion
          Collapse [Na84] is defined as the state in which buffers are
          full and all arriving packets must be dropped across the
          network.  Incipient Congestion [Ra99] is defined as
          congestion that produces increased delay without packet loss.

          The definition presented here explicitly defines Forwarding
          Congestion as an event observable on egress interfaces.
          Regardless of internal architecture, any device that cannot
          forward packets on one or more egress interfaces is under
          Forwarding Congestion.

          none

     3.1.4 Congestion Management

        Definition:
          An implementation of one or more per-hop-behaviors to avoid
          or minimize the condition of congestion.

        Discussion:
          Congestion management may seek either to control congestion
          or avoid it altogether. Such mechanisms classify packets
          based upon IP Precedence or DSCP settings in a packet's IP
          header.

          Congestion avoidance mechanisms seek to prevent congestion
          before it actually occurs.

          Congestion control mechanisms gives one or flows (with a
          discrete IP Precedence or DSCP value) preferential treatment
          over other classes during periods of congestion.

        Measurement units:
           n/a

        See Also:


     3.1.5 Flow

        Definition:
          A flow is a one or more of packets sharing a common intended
          pair of source and destination interfaces.

        Discussion:

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                  [Page 6]

  INTERNET-DRAFT       Terminology for Benchmarking           April 2003
                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          Packets are grouped by the ingress and egress interfaces they
          use on a given DUT/SUT.

          A flow can contain multiple source IP addresses and/or
          destination IP addresses.  All packets in a flow must enter
          on the same ingress interface and exit on the same egress
          interface, and have some common network layer content.

          Microflows [Ni98] are a subset of flows.  As defined in
          [Ni98], microflows require application-to-application
          measurement. In contrast, flows use lower-layer
          classification criteria. Since this document focuses on
          network-layer classification criteria, we concentrate here on
          the use of network-layer identifiers in describing a flow.
          Flow identifiers also may reside at the data-link, transport,
          or application layers of the ISO model. However, identifiers
          other than those at the network layer are out of scope for
          this document.

          A flow may contain a single code point/IP precedence value or
          may contain multiple values destined for a single egress
          interface.  This is determined by the test methodology.

     3.2 Measurement Terms


     3.2.1 Channel Capacity

        Definition:
          The maximum forwarding rate [Ma98] at which none of the
          offered packets are dropped by the DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          Channel capacity measures the packet rate at the egress
          interface(s) of the DUT/SUT. In contrast, throughput as
          defined in RFC 1242 measures the packet rate at the ingress
          interface(s) of the DUT/SUT.

          Ingress-based measurements do not account for congestion of
          the DUT/SUT. Channel capacity, as an egress measurement, does
          take congestion into account.

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          Understanding channel capacity is a necessary precursor to
          any measurement involving congestion.  Throughput numbers can
          be higher than channel capacity because of queueing.

          This measurement differs from forwarding rate at maximum
          offered load (FRMOL) [Ma98] in that it is intolerant of loss.

           N-octet packets per second

     3.2.2 Conforming

        Definition:
          Packets which lie within specific rate, delay, or jitter
          bounds.

        Discussion:
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within
          predefined delay or jitter boundaries. All packets that lie
          within specified bounds are then said to be conforming,
          whereas those outside the bounds are nonconforming.

     3.2.3 Nonconforming

        Definition:
          Packets that do not lie within specific rate, delay, or
          jitter bounds.

        Discussion:
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within
          predefined delay or jitter boundaries. All packets that do
          not lie within these bounds are then said to be
          nonconforming.

     3.2.4 Forwarding Delay

        Definition:
          The time interval starting when the last bit of the input IP
          packet is offered to the input port of the DUT/SUT and ending
          when the last bit of the output IP packet is received from
          the output port of the DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          The delay time interval MUST be externally observed. The
          delay measurement MUST NOT include delays added by test bed
          components other than the DUT/SUT, such as propagation time
          introduced by cabling or non-zero delay added by the test
          instrument.

          Forwarding Delay differs from latency [Br91] and one-way
          delay [Al99] in several key regards:

          1. Latency [Br91] assumes knowledge of whether the DUT/SUT
          uses "store and forward" or "bit forwarding" technology.
          Forwarding Delay is the same metric, measured the same way,
          regardless of the architecture of the DUT/SUT.

          2. Forwarding Delay is a last-in, last-out (LILO)
          measurement, unlike the last-in, first-out method [Br91] or
          the first-in, last-out method [Al99].

          The LILO method most closely simulates the way a network-
          layer device actually processes an IP datagram.  IP datagrams
          are not passed up and down the stack unless they are
          complete, and processing begins only once the last bit of the
          IP datagram has been received.

          Further, the LILO method has an additive property, where the
          sum of the parts MUST equal the whole. This is a key
          difference from [Br91] and [Al99]. For example, the delay
          added by two DUTs MUST equal the sum of the delay of the
          DUTs. This may or may not be the case with [Br91] and [Al99].

          3. Forwarding Delay measures the IP datagram only, unlike

          A metric focused exclusively on the Internet protocol
          relieves the tester from specifying the start/end for every
          link layer protocol that IP runs on.  This avoids the need to
          determine whether the start/stop delimiters are included. It
          also allows the use of heterogeneous link layer protocols in
          a test.

          4. Forwarding Delay can be measured at any offered load,
          whereas the latency methodology [Br99] recommends measurement
          at, and only at, the throughput level.  Comparing the
          Forwarding Delay below the throughput to Forwarding Delay
          above the channel capacity will give insight to the traffic
          control mechanisms.

          For example, non-congested delay may be measured with an
          offered load that does not exceed the channel capacity, while
          congested delay may involve an offered load that exceeds
          channel capacity.

          Note: Forwarding Delay SHOULD NOT be used as an absolute
          indicator of DUT/SUT Forwarding Congestion. While Forwarding
          Delay may rise when offered load nears or exceeds channel
          capacity, there is no universal point at which Forwarding
          Delay can be said to indicate the presence or absence of
          Forwarding Congestion.

     3.2.5 Jitter

        Definition:
          The absolute value of the difference between the arrival
          delay of two consecutive received packets belonging to the
          same stream.

        Discussion:
          The delay fluctuation between two consecutive received
          packets in a stream is reported as the jitter.  Jitter can be
          expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)| where D equals the delay and i
          is the order the packets were received.

          Under loss, jitter can be measured between non-consecutive
          test sequence numbers.  When Traffic Control Mechanisms are
          losing packets, the Forwarding Delay may fluctuate as a

          response.  Jitter MUST be able to benchmark the delay
          variation with or with out loss.

          Jitter is related to the ipdv [De02] (IP Delay Variation) by
          taking the absolute value of the ipdv.  The two metrics will
          produce different mean values.  _Mean Jitter_ will produce a
          positive value, where the _mean ipdv_ is typically zero.

     3.2.6 Undifferentiated Response

        Definition:
          The vector(s) obtained when mechanisms used to support diff-
          serv or IP precedence are disabled.

        Discussion:
          Enabling diff-serv or IP precedence mechanisms may impose
          additional processing overhead for packets. This overhead may
          degrade performance even when traffic belonging to only one
          class, the best-effort class, is offered to the device.

          Measurements with "undifferentiated response" should be made
          to establish a baseline.

          The vector(s) obtained with DSCPs or IP precedence enabled
          can be compared to the undifferentiated response to determine
          the effect of differentiating traffic.

     3.3 Sequence Tracking


     3.3.1 In-sequence Packet

        Definition:
          A received packet with the expected Test Sequence number.

        Discussion:
          In-sequence is done on a stream level. As packets are
          received on a stream, each packet's Test Sequence number is

  Perser, Newman, Khurana, Erramilli, Poretsky                 [Page 11]

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms

          compared with the previous packet.  Only packets that match
          the expected Test Sequence number are considered in-sequence.

          Packets that do not match the expected Test Sequence number
          are counted as _not in-sequence_ or out-of-sequence.  Every
          packet that is received is either in-sequence or out-of-
          sequence.  Subtracting the in-sequence from the received
          packets (for that stream) can derive the out-of-sequence
          count.

          Two types of events will prevent the in-sequence from
          incrementing: packet loss and reordered packets.

     3.3.2 Out-of-order Packet

        Definition:
          A received packet with a Test Sequence number less that
          expected.

        Discussion:
          As a stream of packets enter a DUT/SUT, they include a Stream
          Test Sequence number indicating the order the packets were
          sent to the DUT/SUT.  On exiting the DUT/SUT, these packets
          may arrive in a different order.  Each packet that was re-
          ordered is counted as an Out-of-order Packet.

          Certain streaming protocol (such as TCP) require the packets
          to be in a certain order.  Packets outside this are dropped
          by the streaming protocols even though there were properly
          received by the IP layer.  The type of reordering tolerated
          by a streaming protocol varies from protocol to protocol, and
          also by implementation.

          Out-of-order Packet count is based on the worst case
          streaming protocol.  It allows for no reordering.

          Packet loss does not affect the Out-of-order Packet count.
          Only packets that were not received in the order that they
          were transmitted.

     3.3.4 Stream

        Definition:
          A group of packets tracked as a single entity by the traffic
          receiver.  A stream may share a common content such as type
          (IP, UDP), packet size, or payload.

        Discussion:
          Streams are tracked by test sequence number or "unique
          signature field" [Ma00].  Streams define how individual
          packet's statistics are grouped together to form an
          intelligible summary.

          Common stream groupings would be by egress interface,
          destination address, source address, DSCP, or IP precedence.
          A stream using test sequence numbers can track the ordering
          of packets as they transverse the DUT/SUT.

          Streams are not restricted to a pair of source and
          destination interfaces as long as all packets are tracked as
          a single entity.  A mulitcast stream can be forward to
          multiple destination interfaces.

     3.3.6 Test Sequence number

        Definition:
          A field in the IP payload portion of the packet that is used
          to verify the order of the packets on the egress of the
          DUT/SUT.

        Discussion:
          The traffic generator sets the test sequence number value and
          the traffic receiver checks the value upon receipt of the
          packet.  The traffic generator changes the value on each
          packet transmitted based on an algorithm agreed to by the
          traffic receiver.

          The traffic receiver keeps track of the sequence numbers on a
          per stream basis.  In addition to number of received packets,
          the traffic receiver may also report number of in-sequence
          packets, number of out-sequence packets, number of duplicate
          packets, and number of reordered packets.

          The recommended algorithm to use to change the sequence
          number on sequential packets is an incrementing value.

     3.4 Vectors
          A vector is a group of packets all containing a specific DSCP
          or IP precedence value.  Vectors are expressed as a pair of
          numbers.  The first is being the particular diff-serv value.
          The second is the metric expressed as a rate, loss
          percentage, delay, or jitter.

          consecutive packets' arrival times having a specific DSCP or
          IP precedence value. The value is dependent on the set of
          offered vectors and configuration of the DUT.

        Discussion:
          Instantaneous Jitter is the absolute value of the difference
          between the delay measurement of two packets belonging to the
          same stream.

          The delay fluctuation between two consecutive packets in a
          stream is reported as the "Instantaneous Jitter".
          Instantaneous Jitter can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)|
          where D equals the delay and i is the test sequence number.
          Packets lost are not counted in the measurement.

          Forwarding Vector may contain several Jitter Vectors.  For n
          packets received in a Forwarding Vector, there is a total of
          (n-1) Instantaneous Jitter Vectors.

        Discussion:
          Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector is the maximum delay minus the
          minimum delay of the packets (in a vector) forwarded by the
          DUT/SUT.

          interface in response to an offered vector.

        Discussion:
          Forwarding Vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the

          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in
          response to an offered vector.

     4. Security Considerations

          Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
          the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
          is not performed on devices or systems connected to
          production networks.

          Packets with unintended and/or unauthorized DSCP or IP
          precedence values may present security issues. Determining
          the security consequences of such packets is out of scope for
          this document.
