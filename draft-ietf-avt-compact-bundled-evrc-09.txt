Internet-Draft        EVRC RTP Format Enhancements           August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines support for the header-free and interleaved/
   bundled packet formats for the EVRC-B codec, a new compact bundled
   format for the EVRC and EVRC-B codecs, as well as discontinuous
   transmission (DTX) support for EVRC and EVRC-B encoded speech
   transported via RTP.  VoIP applications operating over low bandwidth
   dial-up and wireless networks require such EVRC RTP payload
   capabilities for efficient use of the bandwidth.

1.1  Support of EVRC-B Codec

   EVRC-B [3] is an extension to [2] developed in 3GPP2.  EVRC-B [3]
   compresses each 20 milliseconds of 8000Hz, 16-bit sampled speech
   input into output frames of one of the four different sizes: Rate 1
   (171 bits), Rate 1/2 (80 bits), Rate 1/4 (40 bits), or Rate 1/8 (16
   bits).  In addition, there are two zero bit codec frame types: null
   frames and erasure frames, similar to EVRC [2].  One significant
   enhancement in EVRC-B is the use of 1/4 rate frames that were not
   used in EVRC.  This provides lower average data rates (ADRs) compared
   to EVRC, for a given voice quality.

   Since speech frames encoded by EVRC-B are different from those
   encoded by EVRC, EVRC-B and EVRC codecs do not interoperate with each
   other.  At the initiation of a RTP session, the RTP sender and
   receiver need to indicate (e.g., using MIME subtypes that are
   separate from those of EVRC) that EVRC-B is to be used for the
   ensuing session.

1.2  Compact (Header-free) Bundled Format

   The current interleaved/bundled packet format defined in RFC 3558
   allows bundling of multiple speech frames of different rate in a
   single RTP packet, sending mode change requests, and interleaving.
   To support these functions, a Table of Contents (ToC) is used in each
   RTP packet in addition to the standard RTP header.  The size of the
   ToC is variable, depending on the number of EVRC frames carried in
   the packet [4].

   The current header-free packet format defined in RFC 3558 is more
   compact and optimized for use over wireless links.  It eliminates the
   need for a ToC by requiring that each RTP packet contain only one
   speech frame (of any allowable rate), i.e., bundling is not allowed.
   Moreover, interleaving and mode change request are not supported in
   the header-free format [4].

   The compact bundled format described in this document presents the
   user an alternative to the header-free format defined in RFC 3558.

Internet-Draft        EVRC RTP Format Enhancements           August 2006


   This format allows bundling of multiple EVRC or EVRC-B frames without
   the addition of extra headers, as would be in case of the
   interleaved/bundled format.  However, in order to use this compact
   bundled format, only one EVRC/EVRC-B rate (full rate or 1/2 rate) can
   be used in the session.  Similar to the header-free format defined in
   RFC 3558, interleaving and mode change request are not supported in
   the compact bundled format.

1.3  Discontinuous Transmission (DTX)

   Information carried in frames of EVRC and EVRC-B codecs varies little
   during periods of silence.  The transmission of these frames across
   the radio interface in a wireless system is expensive in terms of
   capacity, and therefore, suppression of these frames is desirable.
   Such an operation is called DTX, also known as silence suppression.

   In general, when DTX/silence suppression is applied, the first few
   frames of silence may be transmitted at the beginning of the period
   of silence to establish background noise.  Then a portion of the
   stream of subsequent silence frames is not transmitted and is
   discarded at the sender.  At the receiver, background or comfort
   noise may be generated by using the previously received silence
   frames.

   The full detail of DTX/silence suppression operation can be found in
   [8] as well as RFC 3551 [9] and RFC 3558 [4].  This document only
   defines the additional optional MIME parameters (silencesup, dtxmax,
   dtxmin, and hangover) for setting up a DTX/silence suppression
   session, where "silencesupp" is for indicating the capability and
   willingness of using DTX/silence suppression, "dtxmax" and "dtxmin"
   for indicating the desired range of DTX update interval, and
   "handover" for indicating the desired number of silence frames at the
   beginning of each silence period to establish background noise at the
   receiver (see Section 6.1 for detailed definition).

   The EVRC and EVRC-B codecs in variable rate operation mode send 1/8
   rate frames during periods of silence, while in single rate operation
   mode (see Section 4), silence is encoded and sent in frames of the
   same rate as that of speech frames.  The DTX parameters defined in
   this document apply to 1/8th rate frames in the variable rate mode
   and to silence frames in the single rate operation mode.

   For simplicity, in the rest of this document the term "silence frame"
   refers either to an 1/8th rate frame in variable rate operation or a
   frame that contains only silence in the signal rate operation.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3.  EVRC-B Codec

   Three RTP packet formats are supported for the EVRC-B codec - the
   interleaved/bundled packet format, the header-free packet format and
   the compact bundled packet format.  For the interleaved/bundled and
   header-free packet formats, the operational details and capabilities,
   such as ToC, interleaving, and bundling, of EVRC-B are exactly the
   same as those of EVRC, as defined in RFC3558 [4], except that the
   mode change request field in the ToC MUST be interpreted according to
   the definition of the RATE_REDUC parameter in EVRC-B [3].  The
   compact bundled packet format for EVRC-B is defined in Section 4 of
   this document.

3.1  Other Frame-Based Vocoders

   Other frame-based vocoders can be carried in the packet formats
   defined in this document, as long as they possess the following
   properties:

   o  the codec is frame-based;

   o  blank and erasure frames are supported;

   o  the total number of rates is less than 17;

   o  the maximum full rate frame can be transported in a single RTP
      packet using this specific format.

   Vocoders with the characteristics listed above can be transported
   using the packet format specified in this document with some
   additional specification work; the pieces that must be defined are
   listed in Section 15 of RFC 3558.

4.  Compact Bundled Format

   A packet in the compact bundled format consists of an RTP header
   followed by a sequence of one or more consecutive EVRC/EVRC-B codec
   data frames of the same rate, as shown below:

   |       One or more EVRC/EVRC-B data frames of same rate        |

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The codec data frames MUST be generated from the output of the codec
   following the procedure described in 5.2 in RFC 3558 [4] and all MUST
   be of the same rate and size.

4.1  Single Rate Operation

   As mentioned earlier, in order to use the compact bundled format, all
   the EVRC/EVRC-B data frames in the session MUST be of the same rate.
   This packet format may carry only full or half-rate frames.

   For a session that uses the compact bundled format, the rate for the
   session can be determined during the session setup signaling, for
   example, via SDP exchanges.  See Section 6 below for more details.

5.  Storage Format For EVRC-B Codec

   The storage format is used for storing EVRC-B encoded speech frames,
   e.g., as a file or e-mail attachment.

   The file begins with a magic number to identify the vocoder that is
   used.  The magic number for EVRC-B corresponds to the ASCII character
   string "#!EVRC-B\n", i.e., "0x23 0x21 0x45 0x56 0x52 0x43 0x2D 0x42
   0x0A".

   Note, the "\n" is an important part of the magic number and MUST be
   included in the comparison, since, otherwise, the EVRC-B magic number
   will become indistinguishable from magic number used for EVRC.

   The codec data frames are stored in consecutive order, with a single
   TOC entry field, extended to one octet, prefixing each codec data
   frame.  The ToC field is extended to one octet by setting the four
   most significant bits of the octet to zero.  For example, a ToC value
   of 4 (a full-rate frame) is stored as 0x04.

   Speech frames lost in transmission and non-received frames MUST be
   stored as erasure frames to maintain synchronization with the
   original media.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Four (4) new MIME subtype registrations - "EVRC1", "EVRCB", "EVRCB0",
   and "EVRCB1" - are defined in this document for EVRC-B and compact
   bundled payload format support.

   For all the EVRC and EVRC-B RTP payload formats defined in RFC 3558
   [4] and RFC XXXX, four additional optional parameters -
   "silencesupp", "dtxmax", "dtxmin", and "hangover" - are defined and
   used in DTX.

   The MIME subtype registrations, "EVRC" and "EVRC0" originally defined
   in RFC 3558 [4], are updated with the optional DTX parameters.

6.1  Registration of Media Type EVRC1

   Type name: audio

   Subtype names: EVRC1

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      ptime: see RFC 4566 [7].

      maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated in
         each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The time MUST
         be calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the
         packet represents.  The time SHOULD be a multiple of the
         duration of a single codec data frame (20 msec).  If not
         signaled, the default maxptime value MUST be 200 milliseconds.

      fixedrate: Indicates the EVRC rate of the session while in single
         rate operation.  Valid values include: 0.5 and 1, where a value
         of 0.5 indicates the 1/2 rate while a value of 1 indicates the
         full rate.  If this parameter is not present, 1/2 rate is
         assumed.

      silencesupp: Permissible values are 0 and 1.  A value of 1
         indicates that the sender of this parameter: a) is capable of
         receiving silence suppressed speech using DTX, AND b) is
         capable of and will send out silence suppressed speech using
         DTX, unless the other end indicates that it does not want to
         receive silence suppressed speech using DTX.

         A value of 0 indicates that the sender of this parameter: a)
         does NOT want to receive silence suppressed speech using DTX,



Xie & Kapoor            Expires February 21, 2007               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        EVRC RTP Format Enhancements           August 2006


         AND b) will NOT send out silence suppressed speech using DTX.

         If this parameter is not present, the default value specified
         in [8] MUST be assumed.  If the RTP receiver indicates through
         the use of SIP signaling or other means that it is incapable of
         or unwilling to use silence suppression using DTX, silence
         suppression using DTX as specified in this document MUST NOT be
         used for the session.

      dtxmax: Permissible values are from 0 to 255.  Indicates the
         maximum DTX update interval in number of frames.  During DTX,
         the RTP sender occasionally updates the RTP receiver about the
         change in background noise characteristics, etc., by sending a
         new silence frame to the RTP receiver.  The RTP receiver may
         use 'dtxmax' to indicate to the RTP sender the maximum interval
         (in number of frames) between any two DTX updates it expects to
         receive from the RTP sender.

         If this parameter is not present in a session that uses DTX,
         the default value, 32, as specified in [8] MUST be assumed
         (note, if a later version of [8] specifies a new, different
         value, the new value will take precedence).  This parameter
         MUST be ignored if silence suppression using DTX is not used
         for the session.

         Note also that if the RTP receiver elects to detect DTX using
         dtxmax, the dtxmax parameter will affect the amount of delay
         the RTP receiver sees before detecting DTX in the stream.

      dtxmin: Permissible values are from 0 to 255.  Indicates the
         minimum DTX update interval in number of frames.  The RTP
         receiver may use 'dtxmin' to indicate to the RTP sender the
         minimal interval (in number of frames) between any two DTX
         updates it expects to receive from the RTP sender.

         If this parameter is not present, the default value, 12, as
         specified in [8] MUST be assumed (note, if a later version of
         [8] specifies a new, different value, the new value will take
         precedence).  This parameter MUST be ignored if silence
         suppression using DTX is not used for the session.

      hangover: Permissible values are from 0 to 255.  Indicates the
         number of consecutive silence frames transmitted at the end of
         an active speech interval but before the DTX interval begins.
         When setting up an RTP session that uses DTX, an RTP receiver
         can use this parameter to signal the number of silence frames
         it expects to receive before the beginning of DTX.  While
         hangover=0 is allowed, it is RECOMMENDED that hangover be set

         to 1 or greater since the presence of silence frames at the end
         of active speech can help the RTP receiver to identify the
         beginning of the DTX period.

         If this parameter is not present for a session that uses DTX,
         the default value, 1, as specified in [8] MUST be assumed
         (note, if a later version of [8] specifies a new, different
         value, the new value will take precedence).  This parameter
         MUST be ignored if silence suppression using DTX is not used
         for the session.

   Encoding considerations:
      This media type is framed binary data (see RFC 4288, Section 4.8)
      and is defined for transfer of EVRC encoded data via RTP using the
      compact bundled format as described in RFC XXXX.

   Security considerations: See Section 8 of RFC XXXX.

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification:
      The EVRC vocoder is specified in 3GPP2 C.S0014 [2].  Transfer
      method with compact bundled RTP format is specified in RFC XXXX.

   Applications that use this media type:
      It is expected that many VoIP applications (as well as mobile
      applications) will use this type.

   Additional information: none

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
      Qiaobing Xie <Qiaobing.Xie@motorola.com>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:
      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
      for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550 [5]).  Transfer within other
      framing protocols is not defined at this time.

6.2  Registration of Media Type EVRCB

   Type name: audio

   Subtype names: EVRCB

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      ptime: see RFC 4566 [7].

      maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated in
         each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The time MUST
         be calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the
         packet represents.  The time SHOULD be a multiple of the
         duration of a single codec data frame (20 msec).  If not
         signaled, the default maxptime value MUST be 200 milliseconds.

      maxinterleave: Maximum number for interleaving length (field LLL
         in the Interleaving Octet).  The interleaving lengths used in
         the entire session MUST NOT exceed this maximum value.  If not
         signaled, the maxinterleave length MUST be 5.

      silencesupp: see Section 6.1

      dtxmax: see Section 6.1

      dtxmin: see Section 6.1

      hangover: see Section 6.1

   Encoding considerations:
      This media type is framed binary data (see RFC 4288, Section 4.8)
      and is defined for transfer of EVRC-B encoded data via RTP using
      the Interleaved/Bundled packet format specified in RFC 3558 [4].

   Security considerations: See Section 8 of RFC XXXX.

   Interoperability considerations: none

6.7  Mapping MIME Parameters into SDP

   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [7], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the compact bundled format for
   EVRC/EVRC-B encoded speech, the mapping is as follows:

   o  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The MIME subtype ("EVRC", "EVRC0", "EVRC1", "EVRCB", EVRCB0", or
      "EVRCB1") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding name.

   o  The optional parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" (for subtypes EVRC,
      EVRC1, EVRCB, and EVRCB1) go in the SDP "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime"
      attributes, respectively.

   o  The optional parameter "maxinterleave" (for subtypes EVRC and
      EVRCB) goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying it directly
      from the MIME media type string as "maxinterleave=value".

   o  The optional parameter "fixedrate" (for subtypes EVRC1 and EVRCB1)
      goes in "a=fmtp" attribute by copying it directly from the MIME
      media type string as "fixedrate=value".

Internet-Draft        EVRC RTP Format Enhancements           August 2006


   o  The optional parameters "silencesupp", "dtxmax", "dtxmin", and
      "hangover" go in "a=fmtp" attribute by copying it directly from
      the MIME media type string as "silencesupp=value", "dtxmax=value",
      "dtxmin=value", and "hangover=value", respectively.

   Example of usage of EVRC1:

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 EVRC1/8000
     a=fmtp:97 fixedrate=0.5
     a=maxptime:120

   Example of usage of EVRCB:

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 EVRCB/8000
     a=maxptime:120

   Example of usage of EVRCB0:

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 EVRCB0/8000

   Example of usage of EVRCB1:

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 EVRCB1/8000
     a=fmtp:97 fixedrate=0.5
     a=maxptime:100

   Example of usage of EVRC with DTX with silencesupp=1:

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 EVRC/8000
     a=fmtp:97 silencesupp=1 dtxmax=32 dtxmin=12 hangover=1

   Examples of usage of EVRC with DTX with silencesupp=0:

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
     a=rtpmap:97 EVRC/8000
     a=fmtp:97 silencesupp=0


6.8  Usage in Offer/Answer

   All SDP parameters in this payload format are declarative, and all
   reasonable values are expected to be supported.  In particular, when
   DTX is supported, the RTP sender implementation SHOULD support



Xie & Kapoor            Expires February 21, 2007              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft        EVRC RTP Format Enhancements           August 2006


   hangover, dtxmin, and dtxmax values from 0 to 255.  Thus, the
   standard usage of Offer/Answer as described in RFC 3264 [6] SHOULD be
   followed.

   In addition, the following rules MUST be followed while negotiating
   DTX parameters:

   1.  If any DTX parameter is not present in either offer and/or
       answer, the default value of the DTX parameter MUST be assumed.

   2.  If silencesupp is present and set to 0 in either offer or answer,
       the values of all received DTX parameters other than silencesupp
       SHOULD be ignored.

   3.  In an offer or answer, the value of dtxmax SHOULD always be
       larger than or equal to the value of dtxmin, regardless of
       whether the values are indicated explicitly or implicitly by
       default.  Moreover, if the indicated value of dtxmin is larger
       than that of dtxmax, an RTP sender MUST ignore the indicated
       values and MUST fall back on using the default dtxmin and dtxmax
       values.


7.  Backward Compatibility with RFC 3558

   This document adds new optional DTX parameters to the original EVRC
   payload subtypes "EVRC" and "EVRC0" defined in RFC 3558.  Since the
   new DTX parameters are receiver options, we expect the existing RFC
   3558 implementations will not send any of the DTX parameters in their
   SDP and will ignore any DTX parameters they receive.  The adaptive
   DTX behavior of DTX-capable EVRC codecs (as detailed in [8], Section
   4.3.5) ensures the backward interoperability between the DTX-capable
   EVRC codec and non-DTX EVRC codecs.

8.  Security Considerations

   Implementations using the payload defined in this specification are
   subject to the security considerations discussed in RFC 3558 [4], RFC
   3550 [5], and any appropriate profile (for example RFC3551 [9]).
   This payload does not specify any different security services.
