       CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE): Hash Algorithms
                      draft-ietf-cose-hash-algs-00

Abstract

   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax
   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct] does not define any direct methods
   for using hash algorithms.  There are however circumstances where
   hash algorithms are used: Indirect signatures where the hash of one
   or more contents are signed.  X.509 certificate or other object
   identification by the use of a thumbprint.  This document defines a
   set of hash algorithms that are identified by COSE Algorithm
   Identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax does not define
   any direct methods for the use of hash algorithms.  It also does not
   define a structure syntax that is used to encode a digested object
   structure along the lines of the DigestedData ASN.1 structure in
   [CMS].  This omission was intentional as a structure consisting of
   jut a digest identifier, the content, and a digest value does not by
   itself provide any strong security service.  Additional, an
   application is going to be better off defining this type of structure
   so that it can add any additional data that needs to be hashed as
   well as methods of obtaining the data.

   While the above is true, there are some cases where having some
   standard hash algorithms defined for COSE with a common identifier
   makes a great deal of sense.  Two of the cases where these are going
   to be used are:

   *  Indirect signing of content, and

   *  Object identification.

   Indirect signing of content is a paradigm where the content is not
   directly signed, but instead a hash of the content is computed and
   that hash value, along with the hash algorithm, is included in the
   content that will be signed.  Doing indirect signing allows for the a
   signature to be validated without first downloading all of the
   content associated with the signature.  This capability can be of
   even grater importance in a constrained environment as not all of the
   content signed may be needed by the device.

   The use of hashes to identify objects is something that has been very
   common.  One of the primary things that has been identified by a hash
   function for secure message is a certificate.  Two examples of this
   can be found in [ESS] and the newly defined COSE equivalents in
   [I-D.ietf-cose-x509].

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Open Issues

   *  Are there additional SHA-2 formulations that need to be added or
      should some of the ones in this document be removed?

   *  Should additional hash algorithms be added to the document?

   *  Review the Recommended column in all of the tables to make sure
      that the values are correct.

   *  Are there recommendations that should be provided on what range of
      identifiers should be used for these algorithms?  Inputs would
      include the expected frequency of use for each algorithm.

2.  Hash Algorithm Identifiers

2.1.  SHA-1 Hash Algorithm

   The SHA-1 hash algorithm [RFC3174] wsa designed by the United States
   National Security Agenciy and published in 1995.  Since that time a
   large amount of cryptographic analysis has been applied to this
   algorithm and a successful collision attack has been created
   ([SHA-1-collision]).  The IETF formally started discouraging the use
   of SHA-1 with the publishing of [RFC6194].

   Dispite the above, there are still times where SHA-1 needs to be used
   and therefore it makes sense to assign a point for the use of this
   hash algorithm.  Some of these situations are with historic HSMs
   where only SHA-1 is implemented or where the SHA-1 value is used for
   the purpose of filtering and thus the collision resistance property
   is not needed.

   Because of the known issues for SHA-1 and the fact that is should no
   longer be used, the algorithm will be registered with the
   recommendation of "Depreciated".

      +-------+-------+-------------+-----------------+-------------+

                       Table 1: SHA-1 Hash Algorithm

2.2.  SHA-2 Hash Algorithms

   The family of SHA-2 hash algorithms [FIPS-180-4] was designed by the
   United States National Security Agency and published in 2001.  Since
   that time some additional algorithms have been added to the original
   set to deal with length extension attacks and some performance
   issues.  While the SHA-3 hash algorithms has been published since
   that time, the SHA-2 algorithms are still broadly used.

   There are a number of different parameters for the SHA-2 hash
   functions.  The set of hash functions which have been chosen for
   inclusion in this document are based on those different parameters
   and some of the trade-offs involved.

   *  *SHA-256/64* provides a truncated hash.  The length of the
      truncation is designed to allow for smaller transmission size.
      The trade-off is that the odds that a collision will occur
      increase proportionally.  Locations that use this hash function
      need either to analysis the potential problems with having a
      collision occur, or where the only function of the hash is to
      narrow the possible choices.

      The latter is the case for [I-D.ietf-cose-x509], the hash value is
      used to select possible certificates and, if there are multiple
      choices then, each choice can be tested by using the public key.

   *  *SHA-256* is probably the most common hash function used
      currently.  SHA-256 is the most efficient hash algorithm for
      32-bit hardware.

   *  *SHA-384* and *SHA-512* hash functions are more efficient when run
      on 64-bit hardware.

   *  *SHA-512/256* provides a hash function that runs more efficiently
      on 64-bit hardware, but offers the same security levels as SHA-
      256.

2.3.  SHAKE Algorithms

   The family SHA-3 hash algorithms [FIPS-180-4] was the result of a
   competition run by NIST.  The pair of algorithms known as SHAKE-128
   and SHAKE-256 are the instances of SHA-3 that are currently being
   standardized in the IETF.

   The SHA-3 hash algorithms have a significantly different structure
   than the SHA-3 hash algorithms.  One of the benefits of this
   differences is that when computing a truncated SHAKE hash value, the
   value is not a prefix of a longer version of the same value.

   MAYBE TEXT: Might not need to define truncated versions of this hash
   algorithm because the length of the resulting value is always going
   to generate a unique value since you cannot just truncate it like you
   can with SHA-1 and SHA-2.

   +==========+=======+===============+=================+=============+
   | SHAKE128 | TBD10 | 128-bit SHAKE | [This Document] | Yes         |
   +----------+-------+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
   | SHAKE256 | TBD11 | 256-bit SHAKE | [This Document] | Yes         |

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  COSE Algorithm Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following algorithms in the "COSE
   Algorithms" registry.

   *  The SHA-1 hash function found in Table 1.

   *  The set of SHA-2 hash functions found in Table 2.

   *  The set of SHAKE hash functions found in Table 3.

   Many of the hash values produced are relatively long and as such the
   use of a two byte algorithm identifier seems reasonable.  SHA-1 is
   tagged as deprecated and thus a longer algorithm identifier is
   appropriate even though it is a shorter hash value.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are security considerations:
