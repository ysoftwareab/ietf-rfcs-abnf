Abstract

   When implementing signaling protocols such as GIMPS, implementors
   need a way to test the functionality and measure the performance of
   their own implementations.  In this document, we try to provide a
   sketch for such a testing tool, a simple, stateless Ping Protocol,
   which works similar to ICMP Ping.  This tool is able to traverse a
   path from a source to a destination along signaling aware network

Internet-Draft             Ping Tool for GIMPS                  May 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a design for the implementation of a simple
   and basic stateless Ping tool for traversal of General Internet
   Messaging Protocol for Signaling (GIMPS) [1] aware network nodes.

   In the NSIS two-layer architecture, GIMPS is being developed as the
   fundamental building block to provide generic signaling services for
   various signaling applications.  Without implementing any full-
   fledged signaling application, GIMPS implementors may want to test
   the functionality and run-time properties of the protocol.  A tool
   for such purposes, so-called "Ping Tool" in the document, which is
   inspired by the ping client done in the implementation of the Cross
   Application Signaling Protocol (CASP)  [2] at Univ Goettingen,
   suffices this need.

   An implementation of the ping tool is able to traverse each GIMPS
   aware node from initiator to responder and back to the initator.
   Useful information about the signaling behaviour e.g., information
   about the signaling-aware hops and GIMPS layer processing delays is
   collected while traversing the network.

   The initial functionality of such a Ping tool would be rather simple;
   details will be described later in this document.  With this
   simplicity in mind, we reused the concept of the 'Null Service Type'
   as described in RFC2997 [3].

2.  Design Overview

   The design of the Ping tool should follow these basic rules:
      simplicity (with a minimal overhead)
      testing as many properties of GIMPS as possible

   The ping tool proposed in this draft uses the layered structure of
   NSIS, and is defined as a simple NSIS signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP)
   application.  The ping tool uses the common API to communicate with
   the NSIS transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) and so it is able to test
   the functionality of GIMPS from the NSLPs' point of view.

   The ping tool consists of two parts.  The 'Ping Daemon' is the NSLP
   application that does the real work of sending and receiving ping
   messages.  The 'Ping Client' as a user side program is used to
   trigger the 'Ping Daemon' in a GIMPS node to send ping messages.
   Additionally the 'Ping Client' can perform the anlysis of the
   collected data.

   Figure 1 shows the layering of the ping tool and the common packet
   flow provided by GIMPS, where the Initiator sends data packets along

   the path through GIMPS-aware nodes until they reach the Responder.
   This Responser will send its response message upstream back to the
   Initiator.

   Figure 1: Ping tool layering and packet flow overview

   The proposed ping tool uses the transport mechanisms provided by
   GIMPS.  Unlike the end-to-end delivery provided by the IP, ping
   messages are sent hop-to-hop in GIMPS nodes.  At each node running
   the "Ping Daemon", received ping messages are passed to the NSLP
   level, which decides which action should be taken next.  Thus, Ping
   tool offers traceroute-like path discovery without adding any feature
   in GIMPS.

   So the operation of the ping tool is as follows: The initiator sends
   a NSLP data message (using the ping message format described later)
   downstream towards the destination.  The ping message is passed to
   each hop's 'Ping Daemon', which will add the following information to
   the data message:
      Its own IP-address
      A timestamp with the current time since the Epoch (00:00:00
      UTC,January 1, 1970) in microseconds.
   When the ping message arrives at the receiver, the receiver adds its
   own information same as any other node and changes the direction from
   downstream to upstream.  The nodes are passed in reverse order and
   again every hop adds its own information.  The intermediate nodes do
   not change the sending direction of a ping message, so it finally
   arrives at the initiator.  The collected data is passed to the 'Ping
   Client' which is able to calculate round trip times (RTTs) from the
   data collected along the path.  Figure 2 shows a calculation example.

     t1(x) is the timestamp inserted by hop x in downstream direction
     t2(x) is the timestamp inserted by hop x in upstream direction
     where t1(N) = t2(N)

     overall RTT for node x is: RTT(x) = t2(x) - t1(x)
     hop-to-hop RTT for nodes x and y (x < y) can be computet by:
     h2hRTT(x, y) = RTT(x) - RTT(y)

             Figure 2. An example of timestamp use


   Note that the 'Ping Daemon' will not install any state in the NSLP
   level on the node it is running on, except for the initiator node.
   The Ping tool is therefore stateless.  However the underlying GIMPS
   layer may, and probably will, install state according to GIMPS
   specifications, e.g., for reverse message routing.

2.1  Ping message format

   The ping message format is used in downstream and upstream direction
   and is extended by every node on the path.  As described above,
   currently two types of information are added to the Ping tool message
   by each node: IP-address and timestamp.  Also, the number of hops,
   meaning the amount of nodes the packet traversed, and the message
   length should be present in such an message.  Having both hop and
   length information adds redundancy but can help data analysis in the
   ping client.  To support future extensions of the ping message
   format, a version number is attached.  This draft represents version
   1 in this context.  Finally a sequence number is added to the ping
   message.  This can be used to identify single ping messages if
   multiple pings are send concurrently.  Figure 3 shows the ping
   message format in its final form when returning to the initiator.
   The IP-address and timestamp block for each hop are added to the
   message while traversing the GIMPS network.

   Note that for compatibility with IPv4 and IPv6 the size of each IP-
   address field will be 16 bytes.  The timestamp uses 4 bytes for
   seconds since Epoch (00:00:00 UTC,January 1, 1970) and additional 4
   bytes for microseconds.  This example shows that each hop, except the
   Nth one, adds a timestamp twice, due to the fact that each hop is
   passed twice, one time in downstream and another time in upstream
   direction.  Using this information, one can calculate round trip
   times (RTT) for every node very easily.

2.2  Behaviour of nodes running the Ping tool

   There are four entities involved in a ping session.  Detailed actions
   for each of those will be described here:

   Behahviour of 'Ping Client':
      Contact 'Ping Daemon' on local node
      Request sending ping message with specified receiver and sequence
      number
      Wait for response from 'Ping Daemon'
      Process collected data and generate result output

   Behahviour of 'Ping Daemon' on the Initiator node:
      Create Ping message
      Add own IP-address and timestamp
      Send message downstream towards receiver
      Wait for message to return
      Pass message to the 'Ping Client' who requested the ping

   Behahviour of 'Ping Daemon' on intermediate nodes
      Receive Ping message
      Increase number of hops field by 1
      Add own IP-address and timestamp at the end of the message
      Adjust length field
      Forward message in the same direction it arrived

   Behahviour of 'Ping Daemon' on receiver node
      Receive Ping message
      Increase number of hops field by 1
      Add own IP-address and timestamp at the end of the message
      Adjust length field
      Send the message in upstream direction

3.  Possible extension to the current ping functionality

   Ping messages are currently only used for collecting hop and
   processing delay information.  Further extensions for this ping tool
   are possible but require properly addressing security concerns:

Internet-Draft             Ping Tool for GIMPS                  May 2005


      Collect GIMPS layer state information (although this has some
      implication of voliation)
      Collect all or selected NSLPs' state information

   On the other hand, the Ping tool could be turned into a stateful
   tool.  A possible function of the Ping tool could then be that it is
   installing a state on every GIMPS-aware hop it is passing on the way
   to the Ping message receiver and delete each of the state on the way
   backwards to the initiator.

4.  Summary and Open Issues

   We have shown in this document how a testing tool for GIMPS
   implementations could be designed.  Our intentions were to keep it as
   simple and therefore as portable and extensible as possible.  The
   Ping tool will be able to help GIMPS implementors test their own
   implementation as well as compare it to others in terms of
   functionality and basic performance.

   Further additions to the Ping tool could be support for tunnelling
   devices along the GIMPS path and an updated design for a stateful
   protocol.

5.  Security Considerations

   A future versions of this document will add security relevant
   considerations.
