1.  Abstract 
    
    The identity policy element (PE) is part of the Policy Data Object 
    [RFC 2750] which may be included in RSVP [RFC 2205] signaling messages. 
    Policy elements with a P-type of AUTH_APP are used to identify applications 
    and their attributes as defined in [RFC 2752].

    The usage and format of the PE for application identification is defined in 
    [RFC 2753].  RSVP-aware network elements may use this application 
    identification information to apply appropriate policy decisions for a given 
    traffic flow.   
     
    This document proposes a standardized set of sub-application (SAPP) 
    descriptors to facilitate network element and host interoperability. Since 
    applications, in general, are implementation-specific, a standardized set 
    of APPs will not be covered in the document.  However, hypothetical APP 
    names will be used in the different examples for completeness. 
     
    This document will provide SAPP descriptors only for real-time application, 
    namely, audio, video and telephony (voice and fax) applications.  APP and 
    SAPP descriptors may be standardized for other non-real-time applications.  
    However, this is beyond the scope of this memo. 
 
2.  Introduction 
    
    Many types of real-time applications, such as IP telephony, video and 
    streaming audio, are difficult to classify.  This is because they do not use 
    well known, standardized port numbers or do not have standardized protocol 
    IDs.  Furthermore, devices can send multiple types of traffic, each 
    requiring different treatment by the network so classifying only on the 
    source IP address is insufficient.  SAPP can be used to distinguish between 
    these different traffic types by providing standardized names to define the 
    sub-application type.   
     
    Finally, SAPP may be use in conjunction with other RSVP objects, e.g., 
    Flowspec and Filterspec, to allow a policy server (PDP) to make more 
    informed policy decisions on the traffic to be sent to the network. 
    
3.  Standardized Set of Sub-Application IDs 
    
    RFC 2872 provides some examples for Sub-application (SAPP) identification.  
    These attributes are provided in the Policy Locator attribute field in the 
    Policy Element.  To facilitate interoperability, a standardized set of SAPP 
    descriptors are provided in the next sections.  Many of the SAPP descriptors 
    used are defined in [RTP Profile]. 
     
    The sub-application (SAPP) identifiers described in the next sub-sections 
    consist of audio, voice, fax and video.  Each of these has additional SAPPs 
    which provide additional descriptors used to identify the application. 
    
3.1 Audio 

    Audio SAPPs must include one codec and may include one or more additional 
    SAPPs.  The focus of these audio SAPPs is for use in real-time, streaming

    audio applications such as Internet radio or music broadcasts.  However, the 
    audio SAPPs may also be used for the identification of other audio 
    applications as well. 
     
    SAPP=Audio 
     
    SAPP=MP1-32 
    SAPP=MP1-44.1 
    SAPP=MP1-48 
    SAPP=MP2-16 
    SAPP=MP2-22.05 
    SAPP=MP2-24 
    SAPP=MP2-32 
    SAPP=MP2-44.1 
    SAPP=MP2-48 
    SAPP=MP3-32 
    SAPP=MP3-44.1 
    SAPP=MP3-48 
     
    This example specifies an MP1 (MPEG-1) audio file playing on a CD Audio 
    Player device. 
     
    Example:  APP=CD Audio Player SAPP=Audio, SAPP=MP1-44.1 
     
3.2 Voice 
     
    Voice SAPPs must include at least one codec and may include one or more 
    additional SAPPs.  When a VAD (Voice Activity Detection) SAPP, which 
    includes silence suppression, is included, it indicates that VAD is 
    supported.  If the VAD SAPP is not included then it indicates that VAD is 
    not supported. 
     
    While a voice application may be considered an audio application, this 
    document  has separated them because there are unique differences between 
    the two. Voice applications are interactive and as such are more latency 
    sensitive than audio applications.  A network administrator will apply 
    different policies that will take this into account and hence this 
    difference is of interest in the policy decisions made by the PDPs (Policy 
    Decision Points) and PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) network elements 
    enforcing the traffic.   
     
    SAPP=Voice 
     
    SAPP=G.711 
    SAPP=G.729 
    SAPP=G.728 
    SAPP=G.722

                    draft-ietf-rap-policy-appids-00.txt           July 2000 
 
 
    SAPP=G.723.1 
    SAPP=G.726-40 
    SAPP=G.726-32 
    SAPP=G.726-24 
    SAPP=G.726-16 
    SAPP=GSM6.10 
    SAPP=GSM6.90 
    SAPP=GSM-HR 
    SAPP=GSM-EFR 
     
    SAPP=VAD     
     
    In this example, the IP Phone indicates that it will use the G.729 codec 
    with VAD (Voice Activity Detection) enabled (and hence, silence suppression 
    enabled) for a voice call. 
     
    Example:  APP=IP Phone, SAPP=Voice, SAPP=G.729, SAPP=VAD 

3.3 Fax 
     
    There are two predominant ITU-T IP-based Fax standards, namely, T.38 and 
    T.37.  The SAPPs for fax must include the standard it is using (T.38 or 
    T.37) and at least one modulation scheme. 
     
    SAPP=Fax 
     
    SAPP=T.38 
    SAPP=T.37 
     
    SAPP=V.90 
    SAPP=V.34 
    SAPP=V.17 
    SAPP=V.29 
    SAPP=V.27 
     
    In this example, an IP Telephony (IPT) Gateway indicates that it will 
    initiate a T.38 real-time fax call using the V.17 (14.4kbps) modulation 
    scheme. 
     
    Example:  APP=IPT Gateway, SAPP=Fax, SAPP=T.38, SAPP=V.17 

3.4 Video 
    
    Video SAPPs consist of the codec including the video window size specified 
    in the standard CIF format.  This provides the PDP with more information on 
    the type of video (window size) to be sent over the network.  A network

    administrator, for example, may only allow an application to send H.263-QCIF 
    video over expensive wide area connections but allow H.263-CIF video over 
    high bandwidth campus LAN connections. 
    
    SAPP=Video 
     
    SAPP=H.261-CIF 
    SAPP=H.261-QCIF 
    SAPP=H.263-CIF 
    SAPP=H.263-QCIF 
    SAPP=H.263-SQCIF 
    SAPP=H.263-4CIF 
    SAPP=H.263-16QCIF 
     
    This example represents a 180x144 pixel Quarter Common Intermediate Format 
    (CIF) frame of H.261-encoded video playing on a Media Player. 
     
    Example:  APP=Media Player, SAPP=Video, SAPP=H.261-QCIF 
 
4.  Security Considerations 
 
    The identity policy element does not guarantee any association with the 
    application initiating it.  However, the identity policy element can be part 
    of same RSVP message that contains the POLICY_DATA object [RFC 2750] which 
    can be used to authenticate users and applications.
