                      PCEP Extensions for BIER-TE
                         draft-chen-pce-bier-09

Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279].  BIER-TE forwards
   and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but
   every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one
   or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].BIER-TE
   Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE).

   This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) that allow a PCE to compute and initiate the path for
   the BIER-TE.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279].  BIER-TE forwards
   and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but
   every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one
   or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].BIER-TE
   Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE).

   [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP that allow a PCE to
   compute and recommend network paths in compliance with [RFC4657] and
   defines objects and TLVs for MPLS-TE LSPs.

   This document uses a PCE for computing one or more BIER-TE paths
   taking into account various constraints and objective functions.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

3.  Overview of PCEP Operation in BIER Networks

   BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on a BitString in the
   packet header, and every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE
   packet indicates one or more adjacencies as described in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].  In a PCEP session, An ERO object specified
   in [RFC5440] can be extended to carry a BIER-TE path consists of one
   or more BIER-TE-ERO subobject(s).  BIER-TE computed by a PCE can be
   represented in the following forms:

   o  An ordered set of adjacencies BitString(s) in which each bit
      represents that the adjacencies to which the BFR should replicate
      packets to in the domain.

   In this document, we define a set of PCEP protocol extensions,
   including a new PCEP capability,a new Path Setup Type (PST) ,reuse
   BIER END-POINT Object,a new Objective Functions subobjects,a new ERO
   subobjects, a new RRO subobjects, a new PCEP error codes and
   procedures.

4.1.  The OPEN Object

4.1.1.  The BIER-TE PCE Capability sub-TLV

   [RFC8408]defines the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV for use in the
   OPEN object.  The PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV contains an optional
   list of sub-TLVs which are intended to convey parameters that are
   associated with the path setup types supported by a PCEP speaker.

   This document defines a new Path Setup Type (PST) for BIER-TE as
   follows:

   o  PST = TBD2: Path is setup using BIER-TE technique.

   A PCEP speaker MUST indicate its support of the function described in
   this document by sending a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN
   object with this new PST included in the PST list.

   This document also defines the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  PCEP
   speakers use this sub-TLV to exchange BIER capability.  If a PCEP
   speaker includes PST=TBD2 in the PST List of the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV then it MUST also include the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY
   sub-TLV inside the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV.

   The format of the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is shown in the
   following figure:


         0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 1 BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV format

   The code point for the TLV type is to be defined by IANA.

   Length: 4 bytes.

   The "Reserved" (2 octet) and "Flags" (2 octet) fields are currently
   unused, and MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

4.2.  The RP/SRP Object

   In order to setup an BIER-TE, a new PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV MUST be
   contained in RP/SRP object.  This document defines a new Path Setup
   Type (PST=TBD2) for BIER-TE.

4.3.  END-POINTS object

   The END-POINTS object which is defined in [RFC8306]is used in a PCReq
   message to specify the BIER information of the path for which a path
   computation is requested.  To represent the end points for a BIER
   path efficiently, we reuse the P2MP END-POINTS object body for
   IPv4(Object-Type 3) and END-POINTS object body for IPv6 (Object-Type
   4) which is defined in [RFC8306].

4.4.  Objective Functions

   [RFC5541] defines a mechanism to specify an objective function (OF)
   that is used by a PCE when it computes a path.  For a BIER-TE path,a
   new OF is defined.


          Objective Function Code: TBD3
          Name: Minimum Bit Sets (MBS)
          Description: Find a path represented by BitPositions that has
                       the minimum number of bit sets.

4.5.  ERO Object

   BIER-TE consists of one or more adjacencies BitStrings where every
   BitPosition of the BitString indicates one or more adjacencies, as
   described in([RFC8279]).

   The ERO object specified in [RFC5440] is used to encode the path of a
   TE LSP through the network.The ERO is carried within a PCRep message
   to provide the computed TE LSP if the path computation was
   successful.In order to carry BIER-TE explicit paths, this document
   defines a new ERO subobjects referred to as "BIER-TE-ERO subobjects"
   whose formats are specified in the following section.  An BIER-TE-ERO
   subobjects carrying a adjacencies BitStrings consists of one or more
   BIER-TE-ERO subobject(s).

   a strict hop in the explicit route.

   Type: TBD4

   Length: 1 octet ([RFC3209]).  Contains the total length of the
   subobject in octets.  The Length MUST be at least 8, and MUST be a
   multiple of 4.

   BS Length: A 1 octet field encodes the length in bits of the
   BitString as per [RFC8296], the maximum length of the BitString is 5,
   it indicates the length of BitString is 1024.It is used to refer to
   the number of bits in the BitString.

   subdomain-id: Unique value identifying the BIER subdomain. 1 octet.

   SI: Set Identifier (Section 1 of [RFC8279] used in the encapsulation
   for this BIER subdomain for this BitString length, 1 octet.

   The "Reserved" (1 octets) fields are currently unused, and MUST be
   set to zero on transmission and ignored on reception.

   Adjacency BitString: a variable length field encoding the Adjacency
   BitString where every BitPosition of the BitString indicates one or
   more adjacencies.the length of this field is according the BS length.
   The minimum value of this field is 64 bits, and the maximum value of
   this field is 1024 bits.

   The maximum value of BS Length is limited to the 1024 bits, in case
   the BIER-TE-ERO Subobject is too long.

4.6.  RRO Object

   An RRO contains one or more subobjects called "BIER-TE-RRO
   subobjects", whose format is shown below:



      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     ~                                                               ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     ~            Adjacency BitString  (last 32 bits)                |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 4

   The format of the BIER-TE-RRO subobject is the same as that of the
   BIER-TE-ERO subobject, but without the L-Flag.

   For the integrity of the protocol, we define a new BIER-TE-RRO
   object, but its actual value is consistent with ERO.  The PCC reports
   an BIER-TE to a PCE by sending a PCRpt message with RRO object.

5.  Procedures

5.1.  Exchanging the BIER-TE Capability

   A PCC indicates that it is capable of supporting the head-end
   functions for BIER-TE by including the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV
   in the Open message that it sends to a PCE.  A PCE indicates that it
   is capable of computing BIER-TE by including the BIET-TE-PCE-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV in the Open message that it sends to a PCC.

   If a PCEP speaker receives a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV with a
   PST list containing PST=TBD2, and supports that path setup type, then
   it checks for the presence of the SR-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  If that
   sub-TLV is absent, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message



Chen, et al.            Expires January 10, 2022                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            PCEP Ext for BIER-TE                 July 2021


   with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-
   value = TBD6("Missing PCE-BIER-TE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV") and MUST then
   close the PCEP session.  If a PCEP speaker receives a PATH-SETUP-
   TYPE- CAPABILITY TLV with a BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV, but the
   PST list does not contain PST=TBD2, then the PCEP speaker MUST ignore
   the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.

5.2.  BIER-TE-ERO Processing

   If a PCC does not support the BIER-TE PCE Capability and thus cannot
   recognize the BIER-TE-ERO or BIER-TE-RRO subobjects,The ERO and BIER-
   TE-ERO subobject processing remains as per [RFC5440].

   If a PCC receives an BIER-TE-ERO subobject in which either
   BitStringLength or Adjacency BitString or SI is absent, it MUST
   consider the entire BIER-TE-ERO subobject invalid and send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object"),
   Error-Value = TBD7 ("BitStringLength is absent ") or Error-Value =
   TBD8 ("Adjacency BitString is absent")or Error-Value = TBD9("SI is
   absent").

   If a PCC receives an BIER-TE-ERO subobject in which BitStringLength
   values are not chosen from: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, as it described
   in ( [RFC8279]).  The PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type
   =10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-Value = TBD10
   ("Invalid BitStringLength").

   When a PCEP speaker detects that all subobjects of ERO are not of
   type TBD4, and if it does not handle such ERO, it MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and
   Error-Value = TBD11 ("Non-identical ERO subobjects")as per [RFC8664].

5.3.  BIER-TE-RRO Processing

   The syntax checking rules that apply to the BIER-TE-RRO subobject are
   identical to those of the BIER-TE-ERO subobject

   The actual value of BIER-TE-RRO subobject is consistent with ERO.
   The PCC reports an BIER-TE to a PCE by sending a PCRpt message with
   RRO object.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PCEP Objects

   IANA has made the following Object-Type allocations from the "PCEP
   Objects" sub-registry.
