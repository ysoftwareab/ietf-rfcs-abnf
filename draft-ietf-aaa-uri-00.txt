Abstract

   This memo provides an update for the "aaa" and "aaas" scheme
   definition originally specified in RFC 3588. The updated scheme is
   now compatible with the generic URI syntax specified in RFC 2396.
   This memo also updates the syntax and semantics of the "aaa" and
   "aaas" URI schemes and provides instructions to IANA to register them
   in the namespace of registered URI schemes.

Internet-Draft                  AAA URI                       March 2004


1. Introduction

   RFC 3588 [RFC3588] describes the Diameter base protocol for
   authentication, authorization and accounting purposes. The RFC
   provides for the existence of a DiameterURI AVP that contains a "aaa"
   or "aaas" URI. That definition of the "aaa" and "aaas" URI schemes
   follows the so-called hierarchical model specified in RFC 2396,
   although aaa/aaas resources do not point to hierarchical resources.
   RFC 3588 [RFC3588] does not provide semantics for the "aaas" URI nor
   it provide instructions to IANA to register either of those URI
   schemes in the Official IANA Registry of URI schemes (available at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/).

   This memo updates the syntax of the "aaa" and "aaas" URI, originally
   defined in RFC 3588 [RFC3588]. The syntax is made compatible with the
   generic URI syntax specified in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] at the cost of
   making an incompatible change with respect RFC 3588. We provide
   semantics to the "aaas" URI. Additionally, this memo serves for the
   purpose of the registration of both URI schemes in the Official IANA
   Registry of URI schemes.

   Appendix A provides a summary of the differences between the original
   definition of the aaa/aaas URI schemes in RFC 3588 and the update
   specified in this memo.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. The aaa and aaas URI schemes

   This section defines the syntax of the "aaa" and "aaas" URI schemes
   using the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC 2234
   [RFC2234]. The syntax of the "aaa" and "aaas" URI schemes follows the
   model of an "absoluteURI" that contains an "opaque_part" (see RFC
   2396 [RFC2396] for details of the syntax). We import the definition
   of "hostport" from RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and their corresponding updates
   specified in RFC 2732 [RFC2732].

   Both the "aaa" and the "aaas" URI schemes are used to identify
   resources related to authentication, authorization and accounting
   (AAA) functions that are accessed with AAA protocols such as RADIUS
   [RFC2865] or Diameter [RFC3588].

   The "aaa" URI scheme indicates that transport layer security is not

   required. The "aaas" URI scheme indicates the requirement for the AAA
   protocol to use security provided through TLS.

   These URI schemes use the UTF-8 character encoding scheme specified
   in RFC 3629 [RFC3629].

3.1 Syntax

   The "aaa" and "aaas" URI schemes have the following ABNF:

           aaaURI             = "aaa:" hostport [ transport ]
                                                [ protocol ]
           aaasURI            = "aaas:" hostport [ transport ]
                                                 [ protocol ]
           transport          = ";" "transport=" transport-protocol
           transport-protocol = ( "tcp" / "sctp" / "udp" )
           protocol           = ";" "protocol=" aaa-protocol
           aaa-protocol       = ( "diameter" / "radius" / "tacacs+" )

   The syntax of "hostport" is defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and updated
   by RFC 2732 [RFC2732].

3.2 Semantics

   According to RFC 2396"hostport" [RFC2396] and RFC 2732 [RFC2732] is
   composed of a "host" and a "port" elements. If "host" is specified as
   a "hostname" (as opposed to an "IPv4address" or an "IPv6address")
   then it SHOULD contain a Fully Qualified Domain Name. If "port" is
   empty or not given, then implementations MUST determine the AAA
   protocol associated to the URI (e.g., the "transport" parameter value
   or Diameter if the URI does not include a "transport" parameter) and
   MUST assume the default port number of such protocol (e.g., port 3868
   for Diameter, 1812 for RADIUS, etc.).

   TCP refers to the Transmission Control Protocol specified in RFC 793
   [RFC0793]. SCTP refers to the Stream Control Transport Protocol
   specified in RFC 2960 [RFC2960]. UDP refers to the User Datagram
   Protocol specified in RFC 768 [RFC0768]. If the transport parameter
   is empty or not given, then implementations MUST assume that the
   transport protocol is SCTP.

   A "aaas" URI indicates the requirement for using a TLS connection
   between any node, including possible relays, proxies, etc. An
   implementation that uses a "aaas" URI scheme to access a AAA resource
   MUST use TLS over the specified transport protocol, meaning TLS over
   TCP (specified in RFC 2246 [RFC2246]), TLS over SCTP (specified in
   RFC 3436 [RFC3436]) or any other usage of TLS over a transport
   protocol that may be specified in the future.

Internet-Draft                  AAA URI                       March 2004


   The use of the "aaas" URI is restricted by the support of TLS
   provided by the AAA protocol and the transport protocol. For
   instance, RADIUS only supports UDP as a transport protocol. Since TLS
   does not support UDP as transport protocol, implementations SHOULD
   NOT user "aaas" URIs in conjunction with RADIUS. On the other hand,
   TACACS does not offer support for TLS, therefore, implementations
   SHOULD NOT use "aaas" URIs in conjunction with TACACS.

   The token "diameter" refers to the Diameter base protocol specified
   in RFC 3588 [RFC3588]. The token "radius" refers to the RADIUS
   protocol specified in RADIUS [RFC2865]. The token "tacacs+" refers to
   the TACACS protocol defined in RFC 1492 [RFC1492]. If the protocol
   parameter is not given or empty, implementations MUST assume that the
   AAA protocol is Diameter.

   Diameter does not provide support for UDP as a transport protocol,
   therefore, implementations MUST NOT set the "transport" parameter to
   "udp" when the "protocol" is set to "diameter" or is not specified.

4. Examples

   The following are examples of valid "aaa" and "aaas" URIs:

         aaa:host.example.com;transport=tcp
         aaas:host.example.com;transport=tcp;protocol=diameter
         aaa:host.example.com;protocol=diameter
         aaa:host.example.com:6666;protocol=diameter
         aaa:host.example.com:6666;transport=tcp;protocol=diameter
         aaa:host.example.com:1813;transport=udp;protocol=radius


5. IANA Considerations

   This memo instructs IANA the following actions:
   o  To include "aaa" and "aaas" in the Official IANA Registry of URI
      Schemes, http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes
   o  To create a new "transport" sub-registry under http://
      www.iana.org/assignments/aaa-parameters, whose values are as per
      Section 3.1.
   o  To create a mew "protocol" sub-registry under http://www.iana.org/
      assignments/aaa-parameters, whose values are as defined Section
      3.1.

   Character encoding considerations: The "aaa" and "aaas" URIs support
   the UTF-8 encoding scheme.

   Intended use: common within Authentication, Authorization and
   Accounting protocols.

   Applications and/or protocols which use these URI scheme: Diameter
   [RFC3588], RADIUS [RFC2865] and TACACS [RFC1492].

   Interoperability considerations: none known.

   Security considerations: the "aaas" URI scheme indicates a
   requirement to use TLS between every two nodes to access the AAA
   resource. However, only Diameter provides support for TLS.

   Relevant publications: RFC XXXX [Note to the RFC editor: Replace XXXX
   by the RFC number allocated to this memo].

   Contact information: the IETF AAA Working group. In case the WG does
   no exist anymore, any person appointed by the IETF Operations and
   Management Area Director.

   Registered-by: Miguel Garcia, miguel.an.garcia@nokia.com

   Change control: extensions, new parameters and new values to these
   URIs have to be documented in an RFC. The IETF AAA Working Group or,
   in case the WG does no exist anymore, any person appointed by the
   IETF Operations and Management Area Director, will provide expert
   review and advise to the change control process.

6. Security Considerations

   This memo does not specify a protocol, but the syntax and semantics
   of the "aaa" and "aaas" URI schemes. A "aaas" URI scheme indicates a
   requirement to use TLS over the specified transport protocol to
   provide security functions. Each AAA protocol (e.g., Diameter),
   provides additional normative behaviour on the usage of the AAA
   protocol over TLS. Diameter provides the normative behavior of the
   TLS usage in Section 13.2 of RFC 3588 [RFC3588]. At the time of
   writing this memo neither RADIUS nor TACACS provide support for TLS,
   therefore, there are no semantics associated with a "aaas" URI scheme
   when the "protocol" parameter is set to "radius".

Appendix A. Changes in the aaa/aaas URI schemes with respect RFC 3588

   o  RFC 3588 defined a aaa/aaas URI schemes that follow the
      hierarchical model defined in RFC 2396 (e.g., including double
      slashes "//" and slashes "/"). However, aaa/aaas URI schemes are
      not hierarchical in nature. The slashes have been removed and the
      URI follows the opaque_part model defined in RFC 2396.
   o  The "FQDN" definition in RFC 3588 replaced by "host", which is
      imported from RFC 2396. "host" allows an FQDN or an IP address.
   o  The "port" parameter defined in RFC 3588 is removed, since
      "hostport" portion of the URI provides a placeholder for a port
      number.
   o  In RFC 3588 the absence of a "port" parameter indicated port 3868
      irrespective of the AAA protocol. This memo makes the default port
      number dependent on the AAA protocol. Therefore, the absence of
      port in the URI indicates the default port number for the AAA
      protocol (e.g., port 3868 for Diameter, 1812 for RADIUS).
   o  Semantics are added so that a "aaas" URI scheme indicates a
      mandatory requirement to use TLS over the specified transport
      protocol.
