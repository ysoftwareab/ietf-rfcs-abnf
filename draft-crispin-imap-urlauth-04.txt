Abstract

   This document describes the URLAUTH extension to the Internet
   Message Access Protocol (IMAP) (RFC 3501) and the IMAP URL Scheme
   (IMAPURL) (RFC 2192).  This extension provides a means by which an
   IMAP client can create "signed" URLs carrying authorization to
   access limited message data on the IMAP server.

   An IMAP server which supports this extension indicates this with a
   capability name of "URLAUTH".


Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].

   The formal syntax use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation including the core rules defined in Appendix A of [ABNF].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.


Introduction

   In [IMAPURL], a URL of the form imap://fred@example.com/INBOX;uid=20
   requires authorization as userid "fred".

   The URLAUTH extension provides a mechanism by which an authorized
   user of an IMAP server can create signed IMAP URLs.  A signed URL
   conveys authorization (not authentication) to its data, and can be
   used in another IMAP session to access specific content on the IMAP
   server without otherwise providing authorization to any other data
   owned by the signing user (including other data in the mailbox
   specified in the URL).

   A URLAUTH signed URL can be used in the argument to the BURL command
   in message composition, as described in [COMPOSE], for such purposes
   as a small client submitting a message forward or resend from an IMAP
   mailbox without requiring the client to fetch that message data.


IMAP URL Extensions

   [IMAPURL] is extended by allowing the addition of ";AUTHID=<userid>",
   ";AUTHROLE=<role>", ";EXPIRE=<datetime>", and ";URLAUTH=<authkey>" to
   the end of IMAP URLs which refer to specific message or message parts.
   ";URLAUTH=<authkey>" must be at the end of the URL, but otherwise the
   order of these extensions does not matter.

   This facility does not apply to any IMAP URL which returns to an
   entire IMAP server, list of mailboxes, an entire IMAP mailbox, or
   IMAP search results.

   When ";AUTHID=<userid>" is used, this specifies that use of this URL is
   limited to IMAP sessions which are logged in as the specified userid
   (that is, have authorization identity as that userid).  If
   ";AUTHID=<userid>" is not used, this URL can be used by any userid
   including the anonymous user.

   When ";AUTHROLE=<role>" is used, this indicates that only a userid
   authorized to act in the given role is permitted to use this URL.  The
   currently defined roles are "compose" (a message composition entity)
   and "submit" (a message submission entity).  If ";AUTHROLE=<role>" is
   not used, there are no role restrictions.

   When ";EXPIRE=<datetime>" is used, this indicates the latest date and
   time that the URL is valid.  After that date and time, the URL has
   expired and server implementations MUST reject the URL.  If
   ";EXPIRE=<datetime>" is not used, the URL has no expiration, but still
   can be revoked as discussed below.

   When ";URLAUTH=<authkey>" is used, this indicates a 128-bit
   authentication key, represented as an ASCII-encoded hexadecimal string,
   which is used to authorize the URL.  The calculation of the
   authentication key is discussed below.


Discussion on URLAUTH Authorization Issues

   In [IMAPURL], the userid before the "@" in the URL has two purposes:
      1) It provides context for user-specific mailbox paths such
         as "INBOX".
      2) It specifies that resolution of the URL requires logging in as
         that user and limits use of that URL to only that user.
   An obvious limitation of using the same field for both purposes is that
   the URL can only be resolved by the mailbox owner.

   URLAUTH overrides the second purpose of the userid in the IMAP URL and
   by default permits the URL to be resolved by any user including the
   anonymous user.  The ";AUTHID=<userid>" and ";AUTHROLE=<role>" options
   make it possible to replace the second use of the [IMAPURL] userid
   field with something more restrictive than "any user."

   The ";AUTHID=<userid>" option limits resolution of that URL to a
   particular userid, whereas the ";AUTHROLE=<role>" option is more
   general and simply requires the session be authorized by a user that
   has been granted a special role within the authentication system.


Authentication Key Calculation and Validation

   Associated with every mailbox is a mailbox access generation key, which
   is automatically generated and assigned by the IMAP server.  An IMAP
   client can request the server to generate and assign a new mailbox
   access geneation key (thus effectively revoking all current URLs using
   URLAUTH with that mailbox access generation key) but can not set it to
   a key of its own choosing.

   The mailbox access generation key SHOULD have at least 128 bits of
   entropy.  Refer to [RANDOM] for more details.

   The authentication key is calculated as follows.  An initial URL is
   built with no ";URLAUTH=<authkey>" field.  An [HMAC-MD5] key is
   calculated, with the initial URL as the data and the mailbox access
   generation key as the key.  The signed URL is created by taking the
   initial URL and appending ";URLAUTH=" followed by the ASCII-encoded
   hexadecimal representation of the calculated [HMAC-MD5] key.

      Note: the reason why ASCII-encoded hexadecimal is used instead of
      BASE64 is that the BASE64 representation may have "=" padding
      characters which would be problematic in a URL.

   A signed URL is validated as follows.  The ";URLAUTH=<authkey>"
   portion of the URL is extracted, and the <authkey> value saved as
   the signature.  The remainder of the URL minus the ";URLAUTH=<authkey>"
   (the "rump URL") is analyzed to identify the mailbox.  If the mailbox
   can not be identified, validation fails with no further checking.  If
   the mailbox can be identified, the [HMAC-MD5] checksum is calculated
   on the rump URL and the mailbox access generation key.  Validation is
   successful if, and only if, the supplied signature matches the
   calculated [HMAC-MD5] checksum.

      Note: removal of the ";URLAUTH=<authkey>" portion of the URL is
      the only operation applied to the signed URL to get the rump URL.
      In particular, URL percent escape decoding and case-folding MUST
      NOT occur.


6.3.CHANGEKEY.  CHANGEKEY Command

   Arguments:  mailbox name

   Responses:  none other than in result

   Result:     OK - changekey completed, new key in MAILBOXKEY status
                    response code
               NO - changekey error: can't change key of that mailbox
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   The CHANGEKEY command requests the server to generate a new mailbox
   access generation key for the given mailbox.  If the command is
   successful, a MAILBOXKEY status response code is returned in the
   tagged OK result.

   Any current IMAP session which has the mailbox selected will also
   received an untagged OK response with the MAILBOXKEY status response
   code.

   If the [ACL] or [ACL2] extension is present, the user must have "a"
   (administrative) rights to the mailbox in order to perform a CHANGEKEY.

   CHANGEKEY has the effect of revoking all current URLAUTH signed URLs
   on that mailbox.


6.3.URLFETCH.  URLFETCH Command

   Arguments:  one or more URLs

   Responses:  untagged responses: URLFETCH

   Result:     OK - urlfetch completed
               NO - urlfetch failed due to server internal error
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   The URLFETCH command requests that the server return the text data
   associated with one or more IMAP URLs, as described in [IMAPURL]
   and extended by this document.  The data is returned for all
   validated URLs, regardless of whether or not the session would
   otherwise be able to access the mailbox containing that data via
   SELECT or examine.

      Note: This command does not require that the URL refer to the
      selected mailbox; nor does it require that any mailbox be
      selected.  It does not in any way interfere with any selected
      mailbox either.

   The URLFETCH command MUST return an untagged URLFETCH response and
   a tagged OK response to any URLFETCH command that is syntactically
   valid.  A NO response indicates a server internal failure which may
   be resolved on later retry.

      Note: the possibility of a NO response is to accommodate
      implementations which would otherwise have to issue an
      untagged BYE with a fatal error due to an inability to
      respond to a valid request.  In an ideal world, a server
      SHOULD NOT issue a NO response.

   The server MUST return NIL for any IMAP URL which returns to an
   entire IMAP server, list of mailboxes, an entire IMAP mailbox, or
   IMAP search results.

   If any of the URLs could not be fetched (the returned data string is
   NIL for that URL in the URLFETCH response) due to a validation failure,
   then this command MUST have a time delay of a minimum of three seconds
   before returning the untagged URLFETCH response and the tagged OK
   response.


7.1.MAILBOXKEY.  MAILBOXKEY Status Response Code

   The MAILBOXKEY status response code is followed by the BASE64 encoded
   form of the mailbox access generation key.  This status response code
   is returned in an untagged OK response in response to a CHANGEKEY,
   SELECT, or EXAMINE command.


7.4.URLFETCH.  URLFETCH Response

   Contents:   one or more URL/nstring pairs

   The URLFETCH response returns the message text data associated with one or
   more IMAP URLs, as described in [IMAPURL] and extended by this document.
   This response occurs as the result of a URLFETCH command.

   The returned data string is NIL if the URL is invalid for any reason
   (including validation failure).  If the URL is valid, but the IMAP
   fetch of the body part returned NIL (this should not happen), the
   returned data string should be the empty string ("") and not NIL.


Example

   Note that lines which do not begin with "C:" or "S:" are continuations
   of the previous line for typographical clarity and are not separate
   lines in the protocol.  For clarity, this example uses the LOGIN command
   which SHOULD NOT be used over a non-encrypted communication path.

    S: * OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 URLAUTH] example.com IMAP server ready
    C: a001 LOGIN fred secret
    S: a001 OK fred logged in
    C: a002 URLFETCH "imap://joe@example.com/INBOX;uid=20;section=1.2
    ;authid=fred;urlauth=91354a473744909de610943775f92038"
    S: * URLFETCH "imap://joe@example.com/INBOX;uid=20;section=1.2
    ;authid=fred;urlauth=91354a473744909de610943775f92038" {28}
    S: Si vis pacem, para bellum.
    S:
    S: a002 OK URLFETCH completed


Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   The following modifications are made to the Formal Syntax in [IMAP]:

changekey       = "CHANGEKEY" SP mailbox

command-auth    =/ urlfetch

resp-text-code  =/ "MAILBOXKEY" SP base64

url             = astring
                   ; contains imapurl as defined below

urlfetch        = "URLFETCH" SP 1*url

urlfetch-data   = "*" SP "URLFETCH" 1*(url nstring)

   The following modifications are made to the Formal Syntax in [IMAPURL]:

enc-urlauth     = 32*HEXDIG

imessagepart    = enc_mailbox [uidvalidity] iuid [isection] [iurlauth]

iurlauth        = [*iextend] ";URLAUTH=" enc-urlauth

iextend         = [iauthid] [iauthrole] [iexpire]

iauthid         = ";AUTHID=" iuserauth

iauthrole       = ";AUTHROLE=" ("compose" / "submit")

iexpire         = ";EXPIRE=" date-time
                    ; date-time defined in [DATETIME]


Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed throughout this memo.

   URLAUTH signed URLs with anonymous authentication (that is, not using
   either ";AUTHID=<userid>" or ";AUTHROLE=<role>") can be used by anyone
   to access the authorized data.  Unless it is intended to provide public
   access to the data authorized by the URLAUTH signed URL, anonymous
   authenticated URLAUTH signed URLs SHOULD NOT be used, and MUST NOT be
   transmitted over a non-encrypted communication path.

   To simplify interoperability with a [COMPOSE] server, and to ensure
   that only the [COMPOSE] server should use a URLAUTH signed URL, a
   well-known authenticated userid for the URL SHOULD be defined and
   used instead of anonymous authentication in conjunction with either
   ";AUTHID=<userid>" or ";AUTHROLE=<role>".

   The MAILBOXKEY status response code exposes sensitive data.  A server
   implementation MUST implement a configuration that will not return
   a MAILBOXKEY status response code unless:
      (1) The STARTTLS command has been negotiated.
   OR
      (2) Some other mechanism is provided that protects the session
      from snooping.

   The three second time delay for a URLFETCH failure is necessary to
   avoid attacks in which the server is probed to see if a particular
   mailbox exists on the server by measuring the amount of time taken
   to reject a known bad name vs. some other name.  The time delay
   SHOULD be variable to further frustrate analysis.
