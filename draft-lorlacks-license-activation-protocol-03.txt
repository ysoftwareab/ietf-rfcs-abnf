1.  Introduction

   A common issue with on-premises software licensing is ensuring that
   licensing limitations are enforced.  Digital rights management (DRM)
   is an umbrella term for modeling legal licensing requirements in the
   form of executable code.  Part of DRM implementation is often
   communication with a server to ensure central knowledge of licenses
   in circulation.

   DRM implementations are in practice almost always one-off solutions
   for a particular product.  No observable efforts to standardize DRM
   have been made.  While DRM necessarily relies on either hardware or
   on security by obscurity, another use for DRM is to simplify license
   compliance for honest customers.  Consolidating the license
   information on a single server within an organization brings obvious
   benefits for keeping track of software inventory, obviating the need
   of manually triangulating licenses in use.

   It therefore seems beneficial to standardize a license management
   protocol that is both suitable for obfuscation without giving away
   too much information to active adversaries observing traffic and at
   the same time has reasonable implementation semantics for simplified
   cases where active adversaries are ignored, such as when it is too
   costly to spend great effort on software protection; modern
   obfuscation techniques are complex and accordingly expensive to
   implement, see e.g. [virtsc].  The license activation protocol
   presented herein aims to satisfy both of these needs.

   A "byte" refers to an octet of bits.  It is generally assumed that
   fixed-szie integer types for 8-, 16-, 32-bit integers are available.

   A "UUID" is a Universally Unique IDentifier in the sense of
   [RFC4122].  It is always respresented as a sequence of bytes.  The
   byte sequences use _big-endian_ encoding for all numerical components
   of the UUID.  For example, this means that the UUID
   "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff" is encoded as the following
   sequence of bytes: 0x00, 0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0x77,
   0x88, 0x99, 0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd, 0xee, 0xff.  This is mandated by
   [RFC4122]; _all other integer values in this document use little-
   endian encoding_.

      |  Blocks marked up like this are "asides".  They contain
      |  rationale or examples to clarify as well as help with
      |  interpretation of the main text, but are not normative
      |  sections.

3.  Protocol

   The protocol operates between a client and a server in a request-
   response fashion.  The client sends a request and the server sends a
   response.  Both request and response are each UDP datagrams[RFC0768].

   The protocol can both be used in a direct setup (customer client and
   vendor server communicate directly over the Internet) and an indirect
   setup (customer client and customer intermediate server communicate
   directly; customer intermediate server and vendor server communicate
   with each other using this same protocol).  Practical considerations
   may necessitate one or the other setup.  The choice between the
   setups must be made at provisioning time.

3.1.  Provisioning

   Prior to executing the protocol, every client must first be
   "provisioned".  Provisioning means equipping the client with:

   1.  a UUID that remains static for the installation time of the
       client (client base ID),

   2.  a UUID that remains static for the installation time of the
       client and SKU (client add-on ID),

   3.  unique, hard-to-predict information (client seed),

   4.  information about the expected server.

   The client IDs MUST be generated at installation time.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that a version 4 UUID using a cryptographically secure
   random number generator is used.

   The client base ID refers to a "base installation"; if there are add-
   ons to a product, the client add-on ID can be used to distinguish an
   activation request for the base installation and the add-on while
   still being able to correlate the requests due to different SKU
   fields in the request.  If this is a base installation or no add-ons
   exist at all, the client add-on ID MUST be set to the nil UUID (all
   bits are zero).

      |  For example, take an on-premise version control system hosting
      |  platform.  The base installation needs to be activated for the
      |  product to work at all.  Layered on top, a second activation is
      |  needed for an add-on, such as single-sign on support.  If there
      |  were only the SKU and client ID, it would not be possible to
      |  correlate the two installations on the server, especially when
      |  considering NAT, except through use of such information in the
      |  client seed field.  The client base ID is the same for both the
      |  base installation and the add-on SKU, whereas the SKU and
      |  client add-on ID vary between two activation requests.

   The client-side unique, hard-to-predict information (client seed) is
   typically supplied and generated at installation time.  It could, for
   example, consist of a unique license key concatenated with hardware
   information.  No format is specified; the actual value of the client
   seed is out of scope, but it MUST be a byte string consisting of one
   or more bytes; it is RECOMMENDED to include at least 16 bytes of
   cryptographically secure random data.

   Additionally, the client must be aware of its own stock-keeping unit
   (SKU) identifier.  This is a UUID[RFC4122].

   The server information is typically hard-coded at compile time.  It
   consists of an X25519 public key[RFC7748] and an Ed25519 signing
   key[RFC8032].

      |  In particular, this means that the server information could
      |  possibly be obtained dynamically during installation time, for
      |  example validated through some kind of public key signature
      |  system with only, say, a root certificate built-in at compile
      |  time.  Similarly, it is possible to provision _all_ client
      |  information at compile time; this implies that every
      |  installation package shipped is unique, but has the upside that
      |  all identifiers are known ahead of time and can be checked
      |  against a central database.

3.2.  Service Discovery

   The license activation server has a DNS SRV record[RFC2782] for the
   service name "lap", e.g. _lap._udp.licensing.example.com.  The record
   describes the UDP port to use for the protocol.  No fixed UDP port is
   assigned; the UDP port for an individual deployment may therefore be
   chosen in accordance with IANA policy and the constraints of the
   network(s) involved.

   The license activation server MAY be auto-discovered using DNS-based
   service discovery (DNS-SD)[RFC6763].  The associated TXT record is
   empty.  Individual clients MUST provide a documented mechanism to
   manually override an auto-discovered server address.

3.3.  Request

   Once the client has discovered the license activation server to use
   (hostname, UDP port), it sends the request.  The request has this
   structure:

    +============+===============+===================================+
    | Size       | Name          | Description                       |

    | 2          | Size          | Size of the request in bytes in   |

   There MUST NOT be any padding between the fields.

   The Size field is computed starting at the Version field.  Since the
   client seed (and thus the ClientSeed field) is not permitted to be
   empty (see Section 3.1, Paragraph 6), the minimum value for the Size
   field is 73.

   The term "Seconds Since the Epoch" is defined in section 4.16 of the
   Base Definitions volume of [POSIX.1-2017]; the "Epoch" itself is
   defined in section 3.150 thereof.  "Seconds Since the Epoch" is
   commonly known as "UNIX time".  This field is 5 bytes in length to
   ensure this protocol working at least until the year 10,000.  This
   integer value is transmitted in little-endian byte order and does not
   include fractions of a second.

   The client then generates an ephemeral X25519[RFC7748] key pair.
   Therefore, the client MUST have access to a cryptographically secure
   random number generator.  It performs X25519 with its ephemeral key
   and the server's public key that was obtained at provisioning time.
   The nonce is set to 0.  The key is the result of applying
   HKDF[RFC5869] as follows, where | signifies concatenation:

   1.  Hash = SHA-512[SHS] (thus HashLen = 64)

   2.  PRK = HKDF-Extract(salt=none, IKM=client's ephemeral X25519
       public key | server's X25519 public key | server's Ed25519 public
       key | the X25519 shared secret)

   3.  OKM = HKDF-Expand(PRK, info=[ASCII representation of "56065c4d-
       d2e0-4ba9-bf9f-76f9159e2987-LAP-V02"], L=64)

   4.  the symmetric key for the client-to-server packet is now the
       first 32 bytes of OKM;

   5.  the symmetric key for the server-to-client packet is now the
       second 32 bytes of OKM.

      |  Since this use of HKDF is trivial, determining PRK and OKM in
      |  practice simplifies to:
      |  
      |     1.  PRK = HMAC-SHA512(key=[64 all-zero bytes], msg=client's
      |         ephemeral X25519 public key | server's X25519 public
      |         key | server's Ed25519 public key | the X25519 shared
      |         secret)
      |  
      |     2.  OKM = HMAC-SHA512(key=PRK, msg=[ASCII representation of
      |         "56065c4d-d2e0-4ba9-bf9f-76f9159e2987-LAP-V02"] | 0x01)

   The encryption key is used with ChaCha20 and Poly1305
   (AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305)[RFC8439] to encrypt the request.  There is
   no additional authenticated data.  The client then transmits:

   1.  its 32-byte ephemeral X25519 public key;

   2.  the encrypted request;

   3.  the 16-byte Poly1305 authentication tag.

   The client MUST transmit this information in a single UDP packet, in
   that particular order and without padding inbetween to the server.
   This implies that a packet may not exceed the size of what can be
   transmitted in a single UDP packet.

3.4.  Response

   Before issuing a response, the server validates the client's request.
   If the result of the validation process is negative, the server does
   not respond to the request and drops the UDP packet.  Clients MUST
   NOT probe whether servers drop invalid requests.  In particular, the
   server MUST validate that:

   1.  the result of the X25519 function is not all-zero;

   2.  decryption succeeded (Poly1305 tag is valid);

   3.  the Version field is 1;

   4.  the Size field is equal to or greater than 73;

   5.  the ClientTime fields match the server's idea of the current time
       with at most 30 seconds of difference;

   6.  the SKU ID is known to the server;

   7.  the SKU ID may be for a base installation if the ClientAddOnId is
       the nil UUID or that the SKU ID may be used for an add-on
       installation if the ClientAddOnId is not the nil UUID;

   8.  the ClientSeed field is valid according to the rules known to the
       server;

   9.  the client is licensed according to the rules known to the
       server.

   Additionally, the server MAY check whether the UUIDs match the
   generation procedures outlined in [RFC4122] and follow the expected
   UUID generation algorithm for that particular SKU.

      |  There is no impetus to validate the UUID format of the UUIDs
      |  sent by the client closely.  For one, it is possible that new
      |  UUID formats will be released and used, otherwise causing churn
      |  on the server-side if the teams working on the clients and the
      |  server work separately.  On the other hand, if the type of UUID
      |  is known ahead of time, it may be an extra vector of
      |  verification; however, it is questionable if much beyond UUID
      |  variant and version can even be verified.  Time-based UUIDs
      |  cannot be checked for accuracy because at installation time,
      |  the system may not yet have had access to a network-
      |  synchronized clock.  The node ID does not have to be an
      |  IEEE 802 address (and, for privacy reasons, shouldn't be one in
      |  the first place), so there is not much to verify there.  Name-
      |  based UUIDs would, however, lend themselves to extra
      |  validation.  Choosing an appropriate name space and data is out
      |  of scope for this document.  It remains questionable if this
      |  has any tangible benefit.

   If the validation passes, the server sends the following response
   structure:

   There MUST NOT be any padding between the fields.

   The Size field is computed starting at the Version field, i.e. the
   very beginning of the message.  Since the server data is permitted to
   be empty, the minimum value for the Size field is 56.

   The ClientId field refers to the client-generated ClientBaseId if
   ClientAddOnId was the nil UUID and to the ClientAddOnId otherwise.

   The ServerData field may be used, for example, to transmit a date/
   time by which the client must consider itself de-activated and needs
   to re-authenticate or to transmit feature flags that are supposed to
   be enabled.

   The server encryption key that was derived in Section 3.3, Paragraph
   6 is then used to encrypt the response.  The nonce is set to 0.
   There is no additional authenticated data.  The server then
   transmits:

   1.  its 64-byte Ed25519 signature over the rest;

   2.  the encrypted response;

   3.  the 16-byte Poly1305 authentication tag.

   The server MUST transmit this information in a single UDP packet, in
   that particular order and without padding inbetween to the client.
   This implies that a packet may not exceed the size of what can be
   transmitted in a single UDP packet.

   The client finally validates the server response according to the
   criteria it deems fit, but it MUST at least verify the Ed25519
   signature.  The client considers itself activated if the response
   validated successfully.

4.  Security Considerations

   The client SHOULD NOT be considered trusted.  Tampering with DRM is a
   notorious issue.  In particular, as noted in the previous sections,
   an implementation MUST verify all inputs rigorously.  Conversely, the
   client SHOULD NOT rely on the server's response being well-formed in
   principle; practical considerations (such as with embedded
   microprocessors) may necessitate this nonetheless.

   All routines and secrets pertaining to DRM SHOULD be protected by
   hardware-based mechanisms such as trusted platform modules (TPMs),
   hardware security modules (HSMs), and trusted execution environment
   technologies.  Obfuscation can also aid longevity of DRM by deterring
   insufficiently motivated attackers.

   The server information secrets SHOULD be protected by hardware
   security modules.  Cloud-based hardware security modules MAY be
   chosen for this task.  It is RECOMMENDED that accesses to these keys
   is monitored; for example, an automated system could cross-reference
   accesses to the secrets with timing of incoming requests.

   While the contents of activation responses in the ServerData field
   are unspecified, because activation procedures are often time-
   limited, the accuracy of the client's clock is important.  Otherwise,
   the server may issue responses that are too far into the future or
   already in the past for the client, bypassing temporal licensing
   limitations.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that clients synchronize
   their time over the network, for example using NTP[RFC5905].

      |  While an accurate clock on the host system should by now have
      |  become the norm, it is still not possible to rely on the
      |  existence of one.  SNTP, which is essentially a stripped-down
      |  version of NTP for clients and also described in [RFC5905], is
      |  relatively easy to implement.  It is therefore considered no
      |  issue to obtain an accurate timestamp when one is required.

   In considering an implementation, care should be taken to avoid
   network amplification attacks.  Notably, the server response packet
   SHOULD NOT exceed the size of a client packet under any
   circumstances.

      |  Larger server response packets may be an option in highly
      |  trusted setups or on a delegated setup with an intermediate
      |  server on the local network, where the software vendor does not
      |  bear the cost of the network traffic.  However, this is rare.
      |  It is possible that the language may change from a
      |  recommendation to a hard requirement in the future.

   Using a fixed nonce for the encryption of the request and response is
   unproblematic because there is a new AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 key for
   every request.  Nonces only need to be unique per key.  Access to a
   cryptographically secure random number generator is required.  It is
   therefore no issue to fix the nonce since keys are guaranteed to be
   unique.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The discovery mechanism described in section Section 3.2 requires a
   service name.  The Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
   Registry therefore needs to be updated accordingly.  In accordance
   with [BCP165], it is hereby requested that IANA create a new entry in
   the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry reading:

   draft-lorlacks-license-activation-protocol-03

   *  A pedantic note regarding the definition of a "byte" has been
      added.

   *  Drop the requirement to validate UUIDs per se.  It seems
      exceedingly unrealistic for an attacker to be able to desync the
      UUID in a meaningful way.  Assume network interference: The
      Poly1305 tag identifies this.  Assume unauthorized code
      modification: A reverse engineer would not blindly flip bytes in
      the code; if anything, the UUID generation code would be
      identified, labeled and then mostly ignored because it's not very
      interesting.  The SKU IDs are known to the server ahead of time,
      so validation is pointless.  The request IDs are client-generated
      and thus mostly meaningless.  The only exception to this are

      UUIDv1 and v2, which contain actual time information, which an
      attacker may genuinely forget about and thus give away tampering
      easily.

   *  Remove the request ID from the Request packet.  A client-generated
      request ID may be helpful, but is untrusted.  An attacker may
      intentionally modify request IDs to impersonate another client's
      request ID, so request IDs may not be relied upon for anything in
      the first place.  In its place, the client ID was split into the
      client installation ID and client product ID.

   *  Bump the version field from 0 to 1 in light of the aforementioned
      change.

   *  Do not assume version 1 UUIDs are the only kind of UUID with time
      information.  Version 2 UUIDs also contain time informations
      (though RFC 4122 does not explicitly detail them), and looking at
      the work in draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format, it is quite
      possible that new UUID formats with time information may follow on
      the future.  Not accounting for this would just cause unnecessary
      churn in this document immediately thereafter.  Not only that, but
      the client IDs are generated at _installation_ time, so by the
      time they're sent over the wire, their timestamps have become
      completely meaningless.

   *  Clarify that the server validation of the client packet is a
      requirement.

   *  Fix one more instance of grammatical fall-out from the removal of
      the ClientDate/ClientTime split.

   *  Add various <aside>s with additional explanations and rationale.

   *  Clarify HKDF info constant to be the ASCII representation of the
      string.

   draft-lorlacks-license-activation-protocol-02

   *  Replaced a custom BLAKE2b key derivation with HKDF using SHA-512
      for key exchange.  Ed25519 has a hard requirement on SHA-512
      anyway, so having redundant hash function is wasteful spending of
      code size resources.

   *  Split the single symmetric key into two symmetric keys, one for
      each side.  Additionally, this simplifies nonce handling in that
      both nonces can be all-zero.

   *  Removed specification of the counter value for the ChaPoly
      construction.  The pertinent RFC already says how the counter
      value should be handled, so this was pointless at best and
      contradictory at worst.

   *  Replaced mention of "ChaPoly" in the text with the formal name.

   draft-lorlacks-license-activation-protocol-01

   *  Because IETF ChaCha20 doesn't use numeric nonces like djb ChaCha20
      but rather a concatendation of three 32-bit little-endian integers
      for the nonce, the statement "The nonce is set to 1." in the
      Response section was unclear.  This was clarified to mean the
      first byte (= first 32-bit little-endian integer).

   *  Removed references to a ClientDate field in the request.  This was
      an artifact from early in development and entirely superseded by
      ClientTime.

   *  Made the Poly1305 tag come after the encrypted request; the
      previous version violated section 2.8 of RFC 8439 by putting the
      tag first.

   *  Actually use the X25519 shared secret in the key derivation
      function.

   *  Specified endianness of UUID byte representation; simultaneously
      removed copious amounts of xref tags to RFC 4122.

   *  Moved reference to RFC 5905 to the informative references as usage
      of NTP is only a suggestion, not a requirement.  (The provenance
      thereof as a normative suggestion dates back to a very early draft
      that used the NTP date and timestamp formats instead of five-byte
      UNIX time.)

   *  Added a section to the Security Consideration on why fixing the
      nonces is safe.

   *  Made access to a cryptographically secure random number generator
      a requirement.

   *  Gave <name>s to all content tables.

   *  Fixed a formatting issue where a BCP14 "MAY" wasn't marked up as
      such in the Service Discovery section.

   *  Fixed a formatting issue regarding a reference within the Request
      section.

   *  Grammar fix (lower-case continuation after semicolon in the
      Provisioning section)

   *  Grammar fix ("If a client-generated UUID contain a timestamp
      [...]" -> "contains")
