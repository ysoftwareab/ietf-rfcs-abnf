1.0	Introduction

This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [1] Option 
for the geographic location of the client. 

The DHCP server is assumed to have determined the location from the 
Circuit-ID RAIO defined (as SubOpt 1) in [2]. In order to translate the 
circuit (switch port identifier) into a location, the DHCP server is 
assumed to have access to a service that maps from circuit-ID to the 
location at which the circuit connected to that port terminates in the 
building; for example, the location of the wall jack.


1.1 Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].


1.2 Motivation 

As applications such as IP Telephony are replacing conventional telephony, 
users are expecting the same (or greater) level of services with the new 
technology.  One service offered by conventional telephony that is 
missing, in any standardized fashion, within IP Telephony is for a user to 
be automatically located by emergency responders, in a timely fashion, 
when the user summons help (by dialing 911 in North America, for example). 
Unless strict administrative rules are followed, the mobility of a wired 
Ethernet device within a campus negates any opportunity for an emergency 
responder to locate the device with any degree of expediency.  Users do 
not want to give up this mobility.  Informing the host device of its geo-
location at host configuration time will allow the device to utilize this 
geo-location information to inform others of it's current geo-location, if

the user and/or application so desires.

The goal of this option is to enable a wired Ethernet host to provide its 
location to an emergency responder, as one example. 

Wireless hosts can utilize this option to gain knowledge of the location 
of the radio access point used during host configuration, but will need 
some more exotic mechanisms, maybe GPS, or maybe a future DHCP option, 
which includes a list of geo-loc objects like what we define here, that 
has the locations of the radio access points that are close to the access-
point. 


1.3 Rationale

Longitude and Latitude are represented in fixed-point 2s-complement binary 
degrees, for the economy of a smaller option size compared to the string 
encoding of digits in [4].  The integer parts of these fields are 9 bits 
long to accommodate +/- 180 degrees. The fractional part is 25 bits long, 
better than the precision of 7 decimal digits of precision. Each parameter 
is 40 bits total, in length.

Altitude is represented in measurement units (MU) indicated by the MU 
field, which is 4 bits long. Two measurement units are defined here, 
meters (code=1) and floors (code=2), both of which are 2s-complement 
integers. Additional measurement units MAY be assigned by IANA. The floor 
of a building is often the relevant location information, and not 
necessarily computable from meters of altitude. The length of this field 
of 30 bits accommodates values greater than 8 decimal digits.

Each of these variables is preceded by an accuracy sub-field of 6 bits, 
indicating how many bits of the variable is considered accurate. This 
accuracy sub-field accommodates the [GEOPRIV] requirement to easily adjust 
the accuracy of a reported location. Contents beyond the claimed accuracy 
MAY be randomized to obscure greater precision that might be available.

2.1 Elements

   Opt Code: The DHCP option code is TBD by IANA.

   LoAcc:    Longitude accuracy. 6 bits indicating the number of reliable 
             bits in the fixed-point value composed of LoInt | LoFrac.

   LoInt:    Longitude integer part of 2s-complement value. 9 bits

   LoFrac:   Longitude fraction part of 2s-complement value. 25 bits

   LaAcc:    Latitude accuracy. 6 bits indicating the number of reliable 
             bits in the fixed-point value composed of LaInt | LaFrac.

   LaInt:    Latitude integer part of 2s-complement value. 9 bits

   LaFrac:   Latitude fraction part of 2s-complement value. 25 bits

   AltAcc:   Altitude accuracy. 6 bits indicating the number of reliable 
             bits in the fixed-point value

MU: Measurement unit for altitude. Codes defined here are:

   1: meters in 2s-complement integer
   2: floors in 2s-complement integer

      Other codes TBD by IANA.

Altitude: 30-bit value with format defined by the Measurement Unit.


3.0 Security Considerations

Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this GeoLoc 
option, DHCP authentication in [5] SHOULD be used to protect the integrity 
of the DHCP options.


4.0 IANA Considerations

The DHCP option code for the GeoLoc option is TBD.

Altitude Measurement Units beyond the two defined in this document are 
TBD.
