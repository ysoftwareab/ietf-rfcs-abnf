Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the structure of the IETF Administrative
   Support Activity (IASA) as an IETF-controlled activity housed within
   the Internet Society (ISOC) legal umbrella.  It defines the roles and
   responsibilities of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
   (IAOC), the IETF Administrative Director (IAD), and ISOC in the
   fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It
   also defines the membership and selection rules for the IAOC.

   The IETF undertakes its technical activities as an ongoing, open,
   consensus-based process.  This document defines an administrative
   support structure intended to be responsive to the administrative
   needs of the IETF technical community, and describes how that support
   structure fits under ISOC's organizational umbrella.  This document
   does not affect the ISOC-IETF working relationship as it relates to
   standards development or the communication of technical advice
   relevant to the policy and educational goals of ISOC.

   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) provides the
   administrative structure required to support the IETF standards
   process and to support the IETF's technical activities.  As of the
   time at which this document was written, this included the work of
   IETF working groups, the IESG, the IAB, and the IRTF.  Should the
   IETF standards process at some future date come to include other
   technical activities, the IASA shall provide administrative support
   for those activities as well.  Such support includes, as appropriate,
   undertaking or contracting for the work described in
   [RFC3716],including IETF document and data management, IETF meetings,
   and any operational agreements or contracts with the RFC Editor and
   IANA.  The IASA is also ultimately responsible for the financial
   activities associated with IETF administrative support such as
   collecting IETF meeting fees, paying invoices, managing budgets and
   financial accounts, and so forth.

   The IASA is responsible for ensuring that the IETF's administrative
   needs are met, and met well.  The IETF does not expect the IASA to
   undertake the bulk of this work directly; rather, the IETF expects
   the IASA to contract this work from others, and manage these
   contractual relationships to achieve efficiency, transparency and
   cost effectiveness.

   The IASA is distinct from IETF-related technical functions, such as
   the RFC Editor, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and
   the IETF standards process itself.  The IASA has no influence on the
   technical decisions of the IETF or on the technical contents of IETF
   work.  Note, however, that this in no way prevents people who form
   part of the IASA from participating as individuals in IETF technical

   activities.

1.1  Editors' Notes

   This document is still a work in progress, and, due to time pressure
   and lack of a clear consensus on some issues, the editors have not
   yet been able to incorporate all of the outstanding change requests.
   Work will continue after this version has shipped.

   In some cases the best way to handle a particular suggestion (in the
   editors' opinion, at any rate) has been to incorporate new text with
   an "Editors' note" which attempts to explain the change.

   The editors request that substantive comments and requested changes
   be sent, one per message, with a clear and meaningful subject line on
   each message, as this will make it easier for the editors to keep
   track of change requests.

1.2  Open issues

   Summary of open issues for which we need to find specific IETF
   consensus so that editors can put in correct and agreed-upon text.

      Do we need "pre-nuptial" agreement text as part of the BCP?
      Currently, the doc does not have text for it.  Seems IETF
      consensus on choosing Scenario O means that we (the IETF) trust
      ISOC.

      Do we need separate bank accounts?  Consensus seems to be emerging
      not to ask for that.  So this doc does not claim so now.  Instead
      we specify "Divisional Accounting" (Section 5.1).

      Do we need to add text to protect IETF from an IAD or an IAOC
      going amok?  Seems that IAD can be suspended/fired and IAOC can be
      recalled, and so maybe that is sufficient.

      Are designated donations specified appropriately?  In particular,
      does requiring that not be "unduly restricted" address previously
      stated concerns?  That is what current text says.

      Do we need to be more specific as to how reserves are built for
      emergency situations, or can we leave that at ISOC's discretion?

      We have added a set of principles (Section 2.2).  The remainder of
      the document still contains a fair amount of detail (based on the
      principles) but potentially some of those details can be removed.
      It is not clear whether the IETF wants to keep the details or
      remove them.

      There has been a suggestion that we may need some more wording on
      startup phase.  Not clear exactly what might be needed.  Send text
      if you feel additions are needed.

      Not clear yet if we have too much about the IAD task.  Should that
      task be specified elsewhere, initially by the Transition Team,
      later by IAOC or some committee?

      Would we want the IAOC to sign off on the yearly (or more
      frequent) reports in some formal sense within a reasonable amount
      of time?  This might protect the IAD from some form of open-ended
      lingering responsibility for previous years.  It might also
      protect against having somebody, five years from now, state "this
      is wrong and by the way this was already wrong N years ago"

      How should we deal with conflict between IAD, IAOC and ISOC?  This
      is complicated by the fact that ISOC officially employs the IAD
      while a small committee hires and fires and evaluates the IAD.

      Related to above: What happens if/when there is a disagreement
      between the ISOC BoT and IAOC regarding business decisions,
      spending, hiring, etc?

      Do we need wording about the ownership of IETF tools and data?  We
      have some text (in Section 2.2) about IPR, but does that fully
      cover tools and data?

   the rest of this document.

2.1  Alphabet Soup

   document are reasonably well-known, first-time readers may find this
   alphabet soup confusing.  This section therefore attempts to provide
   a quick summary.

2.2  Principles of the IASA, IETF and ISOC relationship

   This section attempts to describe principles underlying the
   mechanisms described in this document.

   1.  The IETF intends to establish a structure (the IASA) in order to
       get IETF administrative functions managed appropriately,
       according to good administrative, fiscal, and management
       principles.  The IASA includes the IAD and the IAOC, and shall be
       housed within ISOC.

   2.  The IAD, IAOC and ISOC shall not have any authority over the IETF
       standards development activities.

   3.  The IAD and IAOC, with advice from the ISOC President/CEO and
       staff, will develop an annual budget for the IASA.  The budget
       must clearly identify all expected direct and indirect
       expenditures related to the IASA.  ISOC, through its normal
       procedures, will evaluate and adopt the IASA budget as part of
       ISOC's own budget process and commit to ensuring funds to support
       the approved budget.

   4.  Responsibility for the evaluation, review and negotiation of
       contracts and other IETF administrative and support agreements
       and other expenditures of funds under the IASA shall rest with
       the IAD, operating in accordance with policies and procedures set
       by the IAOC and consistent with ISOC operating policies.

   5.  There shall be a detailed public accounting to separately
       identify all funds available to and all expenditures relating to
       the IETF and to the IASA, including any donations, of funds or
       in-kind, received by ISOC for IETF-related activities.  In-kind
       donations shall only be accepted at the direction of the IAD and
       IAOC.

   6.  The right to use any intellectual property rights created by any
       IASA-related or IETF activity may not be withheld or limited in
       any way by ISOC from the IETF.

   7.  The IASA should establish a target for a reserve fund to cover
       normal operating expenses and meeting expenses in accordance with
       prudent planning, and ISOC should work with the IASA to build up
       and maintain the reserve.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   The remainder of this document contains details based on the above
   principles.

2.3  Community Consensus and Grant of Authority

   The IETF is a consensus-based group, and authority to act on behalf
   of the community requires a high degree of consensus and the
   continued consent of the community.  After a careful process of
   deliberation, a broad-based community consensus emerged to house the
   IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) within the Internet
   Society.  This document reflects that consensus.

   Termination and change: Any change to this agreement shall require a
   similar level of community consensus and deliberation and shall be
   reflected by a subsequent Best Current Practice (BCP) document.

3.  Structure of the IASA

   The IASA structure is designed to ensure accountability and
   transparency of the IETF administrative and fiscal activities to the
   IETF community.  The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
   directs and oversees the IASA.  The IAOC consists of volunteers, all
   chosen directly or indirectly by the IETF community, as well as
   appropriate ex officio appointments from ISOC and IETF leadership.
   The IAOC shall be accountable to the IETF community for the
   effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the IASA.

   The IASA consists initially of a single full-time ISOC employee, the
   IETF Administrative Director (IAD), an officer entitled to act on
   behalf of the IASA at the direction of the IAOC.  The IAD is likely
   to draw on financial, legal and administrative support furnished by
   ISOC support staff or consultants.  Costs for ISOC support staff and
   consultants are allocated based on actual expenses or on some other
   allocation model determined by consultation between the IAOC and
   ISOC.

   Although the IAD is an ISOC employee, he or she works under the
   direction of the IAOC.  The IAD is selected and hired by a committee
   of the IAOC.  The members of this committee are appointed by the
   IAOC, and consist at minimum of the ISOC President and the IETF
   Chair.  This same committee is responsible for setting the IAD's
   initial compensation, reviewing the performance of the IAD
   periodically, and determining any changes to the IAD's employment and
   compensation.

   In principle, IETF administrative functions should be outsourced.
   The IAD is responsible for negotiating and maintaining such
   contracts, as well as providing any coordination necessary to make



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   sure the IETF administrative support functions are covered properly.
   The IAOC is accountable for the structure of the IASA and thus
   decides which functions are to be outsourced.  All outsourcing must
   be via well-defined contracts or equivalent instruments.  If any
   functions are performed in-house, they must be clearly specified and
   documented with well-defined deliverables, service level agreements,
   and transparent accounting for the cost of such functions.

3.1  IAD Responsibilities

   The IAD is responsible for working with the IAOC and others to
   understand the administrative requirements of the IETF, and for
   managing the IASA to meet those needs.  This includes determining the
   structure of the IASA effort, establishing an operating budget,
   negotiating contracts with service providers, managing the business
   relationship with those providers, and establishing mechanisms to
   track their performance.  The IAD may also manage other contractors
   or ISOC employees (such as support staff) as necessary, when such
   contractors or employees are engaged in IASA-related work.

   The IAD is responsible for running IASA in an open and transparent
   manner, and for producing regular monthly, quarterly, and annual
   financial and operational updates for IAOC and IETF community review.

   The IAD is responsible for administering the IETF finances, managing
   a separate financial account for the IASA, and establishing and
   administering the IASA budget.  While ISOC will need to put some
   financial controls in place to protect ISOC's fiscal stability, the
   IAD (with IAOC approval, as appropriate) should have signing
   authority consistent with carrying out IASA work effectively,
   efficiently and independently.  If there are any problems regarding
   the level of financial approval granted to the IAD, the IAOC and ISOC
   shall work out a policy that is mutually agreeable, and shall do so
   within a reasonable timeframe.

   The IAD negotiates service contracts, with input, as appropriate,
   from other bodies, and with review, as appropriate, by the IAOC.  The
   IAOC should establish guidelines for what level of review is expected
   based on contract type, size, cost, or duration.  Contracts are
   executed by ISOC, on behalf of the IASA, after whatever review ISOC
   requires to ensure that the contracts meet ISOC's legal and financial
   requirements.

   The IAD and IAOC are responsible for making all business decisions
   regarding the IASA.  In particular, the ISOC Board of Trustees shall
   not have direct influence over the choice of IASA contractors or IETF
   meeting sponsors.  This restriction is meant to enforce the
   separation between fund raising and the actual operation of the



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   standards process.

   The IAD prepares an annual budget, which is subject to review and
   approval by the IAOC.  The IAD is responsible for presenting this
   budget to the ISOC Board of Trustees, as part of ISOC's annual
   financial planning process.  The IAOC is responsible for ensuring the
   budget's suitability for meeting the IETF community's administrative
   needs, but the IAOC does not bear fiduciary responsibility for ISOC.
   The ISOC Board therefore needs to review and understand the budget
   and planned activity in enough detail to carry out their fiduciary
   responsibility properly.  The IASA publishes its complete budget to
   the IETF community each year.

   The IAOC, in consultation with the IAB and the IESG, designates the
   person or people who carry out the tasks which other IETF process
   documents say are carried out by the IETF Executive Director.

      Editors' note: The preceding paragraph has generated some
      comments, given that the role of the IETF Executive director is
      mentioned in a number of documents, some of which are fairly old
      and dusty.  The editors actively solicit feedback on whether this
      paragraph is ok as it stands.


3.2  IAD Committees

   The IAD may constitute special-purpose, chartered committees to bring
   in expertise (on topics such as finance, IETF process, or tools), to
   engage volunteers in IASA activities, or to gain additional
   perspectives.  Such committees may consist of subsets of the IAOC,
   IAB or IESG, selected IETF participants, or external experts,
   depending on the need.  These committees are advisory in nature --
   the IAD is responsible for the outcome, including presenting and
   supporting any decisions or work items to the IAOC and the IETF
   community, as appropriate.

3.3  IAOC Responsibilities

   The IAOC's role is to provide appropriate direction to the IAD, to
   review the IAD's regular reports, and to oversee the IASA functions
   to ensure that the administrative needs of the IETF community are
   being properly met.  The IAOC's mission is not to be be engaged in
   the day-to-day administrative work of IASA, but rather to provide
   appropriate direction, oversight and approval.

   Therefore, the IAOC's responsibilities are:





Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   o  To select the IAD and provide high-level review and direction for
      his or her work.  This task should be handled by a sub-committee,
      as described in Section 3.

   o  To review the IAD's plans and contracts to ensure that they will
      meet the administrative needs of the IETF.

   o  To track whether the IASA functions are meeting the IETF
      community's administrative needs, and to work with the IAD to
      determine a plan for corrective action if they are not.

   o  To review the IAD's budget proposals to ensure that they will meet
      the IETF's needs, and review the IAD's regular financial reports.

   o  To ensure that the IASA is run in a transparent and accountable
      manner.  While the day-to-day work should be delegated to the IAD
      and others, the IAOC is responsible for ensuring that IASA
      finances and operational status are tracked appropriately, and
      that monthly, quarterly, and annual financial and operational
      reports are published to the IETF community.

   The IAOC's role is to direct and review, not perform, the work of the
   IAD and IASA.  The IAOC holds periodic teleconferences and
   face-to-face meetings as needed to carry out the IAOC's duties
   efficiently and effectively.

3.4  Relationship of the IAOC to Existing IETF Leadership

   The IAOC is directly accountable to the IETF community for the
   performance of the IASA.  However, the nature of the IAOC's work
   involves treating the IESG and IAB as internal customers.  The IAOC
   and the IAD should not consider their work successful unless the IESG
   and IAB are satisfied with the administrative support that they are
   receiving.

3.5  IAOC Decision Making

   The IAOC attempts to reach all decisions unanimously.  If unanimity
   cannot be achieved, the IAOC chair may conduct informal polls to
   determine the consensus of the group.  In cases where it is
   necessary, some decisions may be made by voting.  For the purpose of
   judging consensus or voting, only the "voting members" (as defined in
   Section 4) shall be counted.  If voting results in a tie, then IAOC
   chair decides how to proceed with the decision process.

      Editors' note: The above text was changed from the previous
      version.  Are the voting rules in the preceding paragraph
      sufficient?  Do we need to define rules for determining a quorum?

      The editors would prefer to specify the minimum necessary
      mechanism here, but no less.  The text above seems to be
      acceptable to most.

   Decisions of IAOC members or the entire IAOC are subject to appeal
   using the procedures described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  Appeals of
   IAOC decisions go first to the IESG, then continue up the chain as
   necessary to the IAB and the ISOC Board of Trustees.

   The IAOC plays no role in appeals of WG Chair, IESG, or IAB
   decisions.

4.  IAOC Membership, Selection and Accountability

   The IAOC will consist of eight voting members who will be selected as
   follows:

   o  2 members chosen by the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom)

   o  1 member chosen by the IESG

   o  1 member chosen by the IAB

   o  1 member chosen by the ISOC Board of Trustees

   o  The IETF Chair (ex officio)

   o  The IAB Chair (ex officio)

   o  The ISOC President/CEO (ex officio)

   The IETF Administrative Director also serves, ex officio, as a
   non-voting member of the IAOC.

   The IAOC may also choose to invite liaisons from other groups, but is
   not required to do so; the IAOC decides whether or not to have a
   liaison to any particular group.  Any such liaisons are non-voting.
   Responsibility for selecting the individual filling a particular
   liaison role with the body from which the IAOC has requested the
   liaison.

      Editors' note: There has been some question about whether the IAB
      Chair should be a voting or non-voting member of the IAOC.  There
      are multiple trade-offs here, and this should be discussed by the
      community.  Discussion up till November 15th seems to indicate to
      go for voting member, as currently described in the text above.

      Earlier versions of this document used the term "liaison" to refer



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


      to non-voting IAOC members, but this usage has since been dropped.
      However, the term begs the question of whether the IAOC might wish
      to have -other- liaisons (ex officio or not), such as liaisons to
      the RFC editor or the IANA.  The text above has been modified to
      permit this.  Feedback requested.

   Appointed members of the IAOC serve two year terms.  IAOC terms
   normally end at the first IETF meeting of a year, just as as IAB and
   IESG terms do.

   The members of the IAOC choose their own chair each year using a
   consensus mechanism of their choosing.  Any appointed voting member
   of the IAOC may serve as the IAOC Chair; the IETF Administrative
   Director, the IETF Chair, the IAB Chair, the ISOC President/CEO, and
   non-voting liaisons are not eligible to serve as IAOC Chair.  The
   IAOC Chair's role is to manage the IAOC.  The IAOC Chair has no
   formal duty to represent the IAOC, except as directed by IAOC
   consensus.

   The two NomCom-selected IAOC members are chosen using the procedures
   described in RFC 3777 [RFC3777].  For the initial IAOC selection, the
   IESG will provide the list of desired qualifications for these
   positions; in later years, the IAOC will provide this qualification
   list.  The IESG will serve as the confirming body for IAOC
   appointments by the NomCom.

   While there are no hard rules regarding how the IAB and the IESG
   should select members of the IAOC, such appointees need not be
   current IAB or IESG members (and probably should not be, if only to
   avoid overloading the existing leadership).  The IAB and IESG should
   choose people with some knowledge of contracts and financial
   procedures, who are familiar with the administrative support needs of
   the IAB, the IESG, or the IETF standards process.  The IAB and IESG
   should follow a fairly open process for these selections, perhaps
   with an open call for nominations or a period of public comment on
   the candidates.  The procedure for IAB selection of ISOC Board of
   Trustees [RFC3677] might be a good model for how this could work.
   After the IETF gains some experience with IAOC selection, these
   selection mechanisms should be more formally documented.

   Although the IAB, the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees choose some
   members of the IAOC, those members do not directly represent the
   bodies that chose them.  All members of the IAOC are accountable
   directly to the IETF community.  To receive direct feedback from the
   community, the IAOC holds an open meeting at least once per year at
   an IETF meeting.  This may take the form of an open IAOC plenary or a
   working meeting held during an IETF meeting slot.  The form and
   contents of this meeting are left to the discretion of the IAOC



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   Chair.  The IAOC should also consider open mailing lists or other
   means to establish open communication with the community.

   IAOC members are subject to recall in the event that an IAOC member
   abrogates his or her duties or acts against the best interests of the
   IETF community.  Any appointed IAOC member, including those appointed
   by the IAB, IESG or ISOC Board of Trustees, may be recalled using the
   recall procedure defined in RFC 3777 [RFC3777].  IAOC members are
   not, however, subject to recall by the bodies that appointed them.

4.1  Initial IAOC Selection

   The initial IAOC selection will start after this document is approved
   as a BCP by the IESG and accepted by the ISOC Board of Trustees.  The
   IESG, IAB, and ISOC Board of Trustees should make their selections
   within 45-days of BCP approval, and the NomCom should make their
   selections as quickly as possible while complying with the documented
   NomCom procedures.  The IAOC will become active as soon as a majority
   (three or more) of the appointed members have been selected.

   Initially, the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees will make one-year
   appointments, the IAB will make a two-year appointment, and the
   NomCom will make one one-year appointment and one two-year
   appointment.  This will establish a pattern in which approximately
   half of the IAOC is selected each year.

5.  IASA Funding

      Editors' note: Changes were made to this section to be more
      specific about funding sources and where they go.  Some text has
      also been added or changed regarding the reserve funds.

   Disclaimer: The IAOC is authorized to vary the procedures for legal,
   accounting or practical reasons as long as it reports the variance to
   the IETF community and triggers an update of this BCP.

   The IASA manages money from three sources:

   1.  IETF meeting revenues.

   2.  Designated donations to ISOC (both monetary and in-kind).

   3.  Other ISOC support.

   Note that the goal is to achieve and maintain a viable IETF support
   function based on meeting fees and designated donations.  The IETF
   community expects the IAOC and ISOC to work together to attain that
   goal, and recognizes that doing so will require striking some sort of



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   balance.  For example, dropping the meeting fees to $0 and expecting
   ISOC to pick up the slack would not be viable in the long term, and
   neither would be raising the meeting fees to prohibitive levels in
   order to fund all non-meeting-related activities.

5.1  Divisional Accounting

      Editors' note: Added following paragraph on Divisional accounting
      (thanks Glenn Ricart) and then removed the text about "deposit in
      IASA account" from subsections below.  To the best of the editors'
      ability to determine the will of the community, there does not
      appear to be enough support to prescribe separate bank accounts,
      and Divisional Accounting as described below should suffice to
      achieve transparency.  If you do not agree, please speak up ASAP.

   For bookkeeping purposes, funds managed by IASA should be kept in a
   separate set of accounts which can be rolled-up periodically to the
   equivalent of a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement for
   IASA alone after taking into account the effect of common items paid
   for or received by ISOC as a whole.

5.2  IETF meeting revenues

   Meeting revenues are an important source of funds for IETF functions.
   The IAD, in consultation with the IAOC, sets the meeting fees as part
   of the budgeting process.  All meeting revenues will be credited to
   the appropriate IASA account.

5.3  Designated donations, monetary and in-kind

   Donations are an essential component of funding.  The IASA undertakes
   no direct fund-raising activities.  This establishes a practice of
   separating IETF administrative and standards activities from
   fund-raising activities, and helps ensure that no undue influence may
   be ascribed to those from whom funds are raised.

   ISOC will create and maintain appropriate structures and programs to
   coordinate donations intended to support the work of the IETF, and
   these will include mechanisms for both in-kind and direct
   contributions to the work supported by IASA.  Since ISOC will be the
   sole entity through whom donations may be made to the work of the
   IETF, ISOC will ensure that those programs are not unduly
   restrictive.  For the benefit of individuals, smaller organizations
   and countries with developing economies, it will maintain programs
   that allow for designated donations to the IETF.

      Editors' note: Some have suggested we need explicit IETF consensus
      on the above.  So if you do not agree, please speak up ASAP.



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


      Editors' note: Removed "either using an overhead model or other
      unrestricted donation program." because it is too detailed and
      prescriptive.  Send objections ASAP if you do not agree.

   ISOC will create appropriate administrative structures to coordinate
   such donations with the IASA.  In particular, it is important that
   in-kind contributions be "useful".  In-kind resources are owned by
   the ISOC on behalf of the IETF and shall be reported and accounted
   for in a manner that identifies them as such.  Designated monetary
   donations will be credited to the appropriate IASA account.

5.4  Other ISOC support

   Other ISOC support shall be based on the budget process as specified
   in Section 6.  ISOC will credit the appropriate IASA accounts at
   least quarterly.

   If ISOC pays any other IETF expenses directly, without transferring
   funds to the IASA, this will be documented as a footnote to the IASA
   accounts.

5.5  Operating Reserve

   In normal operating circumstances, the IASA should have an operating
   reserve for its activities sufficient to cover 6-months of
   non-meeting operational expenses, plus twice the recent average for
   meeting contract guarantees.  Rather than having the IASA attempt to
   build that reserve in its separate accounts, the IASA looks to ISOC
   to build and provide that operational reserve, through whatever
   mechanisms ISOC deems appropriate: line of credit, financial
   reserves, meeting cancellation insurance, and so forth.  Such
   reserves do not appear instantaneously; the goal is to reach this
   level of reserves within 3 years after the creation of the IASA.
   Such funds shall be held in reserve for use by IASA for use in the
   event of IETF meeting cancellation or other unexpected fiscal
   emergencies.  These reserves shall only be spent on IETF support
   functions.

6.  IASA Budget Process

   While the IASA sets a budget for the IETF's administrative needs, its
   budget process clearly needs to be closely coordinated with ISOC's.
   The specific timeline will be established each year.  A general
   annual timeline for budgeting will be:

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


   July 1: The IAD presents a budget proposal for the following fiscal
      year, with 3 year projections, to the IAOC.

   August 1: The IAOC approves the budget proposal for IETF purposes,
      after any appropriate revisions.  As the ISOC President is part of
      the IAOC, the IAOC should have a preliminary indication of how the
      budget will fit with ISOC's own budgetary expectations.  The
      budget proposal is passed to the ISOC Board of Trustees for review
      in accordance with their fiduciary duty.

   September 1: The ISOC Board of Trustees approves the budget proposal
      provisionally.  During the next 2 months, the budget may be
      revised to be integrated in ISOC's overall budgeting process.

   November 1: Final budget to the ISOC Board for approval.

   The dates described above are subject to change, and will most likely
   be modified each year based on the dates of the second and third IETF
   meetings of that year.

   The IAD shall provide monthly accountings of expenses, and shall
   update expenditures forecasts every quarter.  This may require
   adjustment of the IASA budget: if so, the revised budget will need to
   be approved by the IAOC, the ISOC President/CEO and, if necessary,
   the ISOC Board of Trustees.

7.  ISOC Responsibilities for IASA

   Within ISOC, support for the IASA should meet the following goals:

   Transparency: The IETF community should have complete visibility into
      the financial and legal structure of the ISOC standards activity.
      In particular, a detailed budget for the entire standards
      activity, quarterly financial reports, and audited annual
      financials should all be available to the IETF community.  In
      addition, key contract material and MOUs should also be publicly
      available.  The IAOC is responsible for providing regular
      overviews of the state of the IASA to the IETF community.

   Unification: As part of this arrangement, ISOC's sponsorship of the
      RFC Editor, IAB and IESG shall be managed as part of the IASA
      under the IAOC.

   Independence: The IASA should be financially and legally distinct
      from other ISOC activities.  IETF meeting fees shall be deposited
      in a separate IETF-specific financial account and used to fund the
      IASA under the direction and oversight of the IAOC.  Any fees or
      payments collected from IETF meeting sponsors should also be



Austein & Wijnen          Expires May 31, 2005                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               November 2004


      deposited into this account.  The IAD administers this account and
      uses it to fund the IASA in accordance with a budget and policies
      developed as described above.

   Support: ISOC may, from time to time, choose to transfer other funds
      into the IASA account to fund IETF administrative projects or to
      cover IETF meeting revenue shortfalls.  There may also be cases
      where ISOC chooses to loan money to the IASA to help with
      temporary cash flow issues.  These cases should be documented
      carefully and tracked on both sides.  ISOC will work to provide
      the operational reserve for IASA functioning described above.

   Removability: While there is no current plan to transfer the legal
      and financial home of the IASA to another corporation, the IASA
      should be structured to enable a clean transition in the event
      that the IETF community decides, through BCP publication, that
      such a transition is required.  In such a case case, the IAOC will
      give ISOC a minimum of six months notice before the transition
      formally occurs.  During that period, the IAOC and ISOC will work
      together to create a smooth transition that does not result in any
      significant service outages or missed IETF meetings.  All
      contracts executed by ISOC on behalf of IASA should either include
      a clause allowing termination or transfer by ISOC with six months
      notice, or should be transferable to another corporation in the
      event that the IASA transitions away from ISOC.  Any accrued funds
      or IETF-specific intellectual property rights concerning
      administrative data and tools should also transition to the new
      entity.

   Within the constraints outlined above, all other details of how to
   structure this activity within ISOC (whether as a cost center, a
   department, or a formal subsidiary) shall be determined by ISOC in
   consultation with the IAOC.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the structure of the IETF's administrative
   support activity.  It introduces no security considerations for the
   Internet.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations in the traditional sense.
   However, some of the information in this document may affect how the
   IETF standards process interfaces with IANA, so IANA may be
   interested in the contents.
