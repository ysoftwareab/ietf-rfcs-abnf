               draft-pusateri-dnsop-private-subdomains-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method of providing private DNS subdomains
   such that each subdomain can be shared among multiple devices of a
   single owner or group.  A private subdomain can be used for sharing
   personal services while increasing privacy and limiting knowledge of
   scarce resources.

1.  Introduction

   Section 6.6 of [RFC7558] highlights the privacy risks of DNS service
   announcements in clear text.  While there has been a long focus on
   access control to private services including the use of encryption
   and authentication through TLS [RFC8446] for connections, the DNS-SD
   announcements [RFC6763] themselves may leak private information
   including but not limited to device types and versions, enabled
   services on the device subject to attack, personal names and
   identifiers used for tracking, etc.

   Some services are meant to be advertised and used freely by devices
   on the link but other services are restricted to an owner or group
   and these services are announced publicly as a side effect of the
   current service discovery deployment.

   This document defines a method for collaborating devices to share
   private services with one another but without revealing the existence
   of these services in a public way.  This provides an additional layer
   of privacy protection for an individual's devices or those of a
   defined group sharing a common purpose.

Internet-Draft           Private DNS Subdomains               March 2019


   The additional privacy is achieved by creating private subdomains
   that require a private key for bidirectional access to DNS queries
   and responses for the zone.

   This document defines a subdomain hierarchy for providers to enable
   this feature as well as a mechanism for interoperable transfers to
   and from the subdomain.  This includes creating and destroying the
   subdomains, adding and removing records through DNS Update, and
   techniques for private authenticated queries and responses.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

3.  Subdomain Operations

   An administrative domain provider will enable private subdomains by
   creating a base subdomain at "_pvt.<domain>."  In addition to the SOA
   and NS records, a public KEY record [RFC2535], [RFC3445] MUST be
   created at the apex which is openly available for queries.  This
   public key will be used for message encryption relating to the
   maintenance of private subdomains.

   The Zone bit for all KEY records used in this specification MUST be
   set to 0.  The protocol value for the KEY record is set to DNSSEC (3)
   and the algorithm value is taken from the available algorithms
   defined in the IANA DNS Security Algorithm Numbers.  Only algorithms
   that can be used for encryption are eligible for use in the KEY
   record for this purpose.

3.1.  Domain name encryption

   Domain names in questions, responses, and updates MUST provide the
   subdomain name in clear text to correctly route the query and cache
   the responses in resolvers along the path.  However, labels before
   the subdomain name are encrypted to provide privacy.  Therefore,
   domain names must be encoded and decoded at the sender and receiver
   of the DNS message.

   Only the owner and the administrative domain provider know the true
   contents of the records.  Intermediary resolvers or forwarders simply
   see the encrypted questions or answers as normal cacheable questions



Pusateri               Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Private DNS Subdomains               March 2019


   or response records and can effectively return cache results like any
   other records without being able to understand the true contents.

   The QTYPE of a question and the RRTYPE in a response record are also
   encoded in the name to further increase privacy and reduce record
   type optimizations that might assume particular formats of RDATA for
   known record types.  For example, if an "A" record type was used,
   some implementations MAY assume 4-byte RDATA and get confused by an
   encrypted version that contains more bytes.  Therefore, a Encrypted
   Resource Record type (ENCR) is defined in Section 6 which is returned
   in all answers.  The original QTYPE and RRTYPE are prepended to the
   original QNAME in the question or owner name in the response before
   encrypting.  The QTYPE is then always set to ENCR and the answers are
   naturally returned with this type as well.

   The subdomain suffix is first removed and the remaining portion of
   the original domain name is prepended with the QTYPE or RRTYPE and
   encrypted with the public key found in the apex of the
   "_pvt.<domain>."  Next the subdomain labels are appended in clear
   text to the encrypted portion of the name and type.

   Since there is a limit of 63 octets to a label, it is possible that
   the encrypted portion of the name could surpass this limit.  Further
   work and experimentation MAY be needed to arrive at the best solution
   to this issue and this document will be updated at that time.  The
   current solution is to include an initial byte after the length of
   the first label containing the number of labels that make up the
   encrypted portion of the name.  Those labels will be concatenated
   (excluding the length bytes) to form the encrypted portion of the
   name.  This encoding and decoding is only performed by the querier
   and the authoritative server responding to the query and is
   transparent to intermediate forwarders and resolvers.

3.2.  Zone Creation

   A subdomain is created by the owner in an administrative domain for
   which the owner has a trusted relationship.  For instance, if a user
   has services provided by an administrative domain and that user has
   been assigned a user name or account at that domain, the user could
   then uniquely claim ownership of the subdomain
   "<user>._pvt.<domain>."

   The administrative domain can use any means it finds sufficient to
   verify the trusted relationship with the user including RADIUS, AAA,
   email verification, or some other method not described here which may
   include enabling the service on a per-user basis.

Internet-Draft           Private DNS Subdomains               March 2019


   The user can then create the subdomain by sending an UPDATE [RFC2136]
   to the MNAME of the SOA record for "_pvt.<domain>." containing a new
   KEY record for the zone "<user>._pvt.<domain>."  The KEY record
   contains a public key that will later be used by the administrative
   domain to verify signed requests and send encrypted responses.  If
   this zone already exists, the UPDATE fails with RCODE YXRRSet.  If
   the zone does not exist, the user has successfully claimed the zone
   and all subsequent operations by the user will require knowledge of
   the private key associated with the registered public key in the KEY
   record.  The user can distribute this private key to any or all of
   its devices for access to the private subdomain.

   In response, appropriate NS records for "<user>" will be created in
   the "_pvtr.<domain>." and a new SOA record "<user>._pvt.<domain>."
   with appropriate record fields will also be created along side the
   new KEY record submitted by the user.  The authoritative servers for
   the new "<user>._pvt.<domain>." will be managed by the administrative
   domain provider.

   At this point, the owner has knowledge of the public key of
   "_pvt.<domain>." and the administrative domain has knowledge of the
   public key of "<user>._pvt.<domain>."  All subsequent operations for
   the subdomain "<user>._pvt.<domain>." use encrypted records based on
   the public key of the message receiver.  All operations by the owner
   MUST included a signature using the private key which can be verified
   by the receiver using the owners public key.  In this way, the
   records are only ever updated or revealed to an authorized user.

3.3.  Adding / Removing Resource Records

   Once the zone is created, the user can begin adding or removing
   records to the "<user>._pvt.<domain>" subdomain through additional
   UPDATE messages for the zone.  The subdomain in the Zone section of
   the UPDATE appears as usual in plain text.  However, individual
   records in the Update section of the message are encrypted with the
   administrative domain's public KEY found at "_pvt.<domain>."  In
   order to encrypt the records to be added, they will be encoded in a
   new resource record type defined below called an Encrypted Resource
   Record Section 6.  These records use the same CLASS as the
   encapsulated record and contain an algorithm type to indicate how
   they can be decrypted.

   To ensure zone additions and deletions are from the subdomain owner,
   the UPDATE message must be signed with the owner's private key and
   the signature included in the additional data section in the form of
   a SIG(0) record [RFC2931].  The owner MUST sign the encrypted form of
   the records in the Update section in order for the receiver to
   validate the UPDATE message before attempting to decrypt the records

Internet-Draft           Private DNS Subdomains               March 2019


   contained within.  More information about authenticating UPDATE
   messages can be found in [RFC3007].

   The administrative domain provider can then use the private key
   associated with the public key stored in the KEY record at
   "_pvt.<domain>." to individually decrypt the resource records
   contained in the Update section.  If the records can be successfully
   decrypted, they are added to, or removed from, the
   "<user>._pvt.<domain>." zone.  If the records cannot be decrypted,
   the receiver MUST return FORMERR.  See section 2.5.2 of [RFC2136] for
   the specifics of adding or removing records in the Update section.

   In order to change the KEY record at the apex of the zone, the old
   KEY record should be added to the Prerequisite section and the new
   KEY record in the Update section.  The entire UPDATE message MUST be
   signed by placing the SIG(0) signature record in the Additional data
   section.

   This is useful for changing the algorithm or key length for the
   public/private key pair.

   If instead the private key associated with the public key in the KEY
   record has been compromised, the user should contact the
   administrative domain out of band to verify authenticity and replace
   the KEY record through a process established by the provider.

3.4.  Zone Destruction

   When the owner is ready to destroy the subdomain
   "<user>._pvt.<domain>.", it can do so by deleting the KEY record at
   the apex through an UPDATE message.  As above, the UPDATE message
   additional data section MUST contain a SIG(0) signature over the
   entire message.  Once validated, the zone will be removed along with
   the NS records for "<user>" in the "_pvt.<domain>" zone.  The KEY
   record containing the public key is not encrypted.

   The owner is free to destroy and re-create the subdomain as needed
   for as long as the relationship continues with the administrative
   domain.

4.  Querying Resource Records

   The question section of a DNS query contains the QNAME, QTYPE, and
   QCLASS.  The original QNAME and QTYPE are encoded into a new
   encrypted form and used as the QNAME of the outgoing query.  The
   outgoing QTYPE is always "ENCR".  The outgoing QCLASS is not encoded
   and contains the class of the original query.

Internet-Draft           Private DNS Subdomains               March 2019


4.1.  Signed Requests

   All queries MUST be signed with the private key of the owner.  The
   signature MUST be in the Additional records section in the form of a
   SIG(0) record.  If a query is received that is not signed or cannot
   be verified with the public key in the KEY record at the apex of the
   "<user>._pvt.<domain>.", a response containing the question as
   received with an RCODE of REFUSED with no answers MUST be returned.
   The Authority section of the response MUST contain the SOA record for
   the "<user>._pvt.<domain>." in clear text.

   Authoritative servers MUST verify the signature in the query before
   decoding the QNAME and returning the results.  It is not necessary
   for intermediate caching resolvers to verify the signature in the
   query since any cached answers are already encrypted.

4.2.  Encrypted Questions

   When a query is received by the authoritative server for the zone,
   the private key corresponding to the public key stored in the KEY
   record at "_pvt.<domain>" is used to decrypt the question.  Only the
   authoritative servers have the ability to decrypt the query.  The
   original question is recreated and matching records are found.

5.  Responses

   Responses include the encrypted version of the question (with the
   subdomain in clear text), along with any matching answers represented
   as Encrypted Resource Records Section 6.  Likewise, the owner name
   for each record in the answer section includes the encrypted label(s)
   and the subdomain part in clear text.

5.1.  Signatures in Responses

   Response SIG(0) signature verification is difficult because the
   receiver is not able to determine which public key to use to verify
   the signature.  The response could come from the authoritative server
   or it could come from an intermediate caching resolver.

   Future work will attempt to provide a way to ensure response message
   integrity if that which is already provided by DNSSEC [RFC4034] is
   deemed insufficient.

5.2.  Encrypted Records

   Each resource record included in the response is encrypted by the
   authoritative server using the public key in the KEY record at the
   apex of "<user>._pvt.<domain>."  These responses can be cached by



Pusateri               Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Private DNS Subdomains               March 2019


   resolvers and returned in subsequent queries using normal DNS
   operations.

   The encrypted owner name of an "ENCR" record is decrypted to obtain
   the actual owner name and RRTYPE.  The "ENCR" RDATA is decrypted to
   obtain the actual RDATA of the original record.  The format of the
   "ENCR" RDATA provides algorithm information sufficient for
   decryption.

6.  Encrypted Resource Record (ENCR)

   The format of an ENCR record is defined here for use in the IANA
   registry of DNS Resource Record Types.  It contains the encrypted
   output of an existing resource record along with the algorithm used
   for encryption.  The combination of the contents of this resource
   record along with the public key in the KEY record is sufficient to
   decode the encrypted contents to obtain the origin resource record.

   List encryption algorithms here.

6.1.  Encrypted Resource Record RDATA format

   Show RDATA packet format here.

7.  Security Considerations

   Since responses are not signed, there is a opportunity for the
   message contents to be tampered with.  Fake records can not be
   created but records could be removed from the Answer section and
   header fields could be modified.  This can be partly alleviated
   through the use of DNSSEC.  If the "ENCR" records which make up an
   RRset have DNSSEC RRSIG signatures, the receiver can determine if
   elements of the set have been tampered with.  It cannot detect if the
   entire set has been removed.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new DNS Resource Record Type named "ENCR"
   described as an Encrypted Resource Record with value TBD.
