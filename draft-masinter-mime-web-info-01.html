<h1><br />MIME and the Web<br />draft-masinter-mime-web-info-01</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document describes some of the ways in which parts of the MIME system,
         originally designed for electronic mail, have been used in the Web,
         and some of the ways in which those uses have resulted in difficulties.

         Given this background and justification, this document then goes on to outline requirements for changes to MIME registries and practices for their use within W3C and IETF, in order to address those difficulties.

        Within IETF, a companion Best Current Practice document will be developed to specifically make  some changes to the Internet Media Types and Charset registries.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document was initially prompted by a set of discussions about
Web architecture and the difficulties surrounding evolution of the
Web, Internet Media types, multiple specifications for a single media
type, and related discussions.
</p>
<p>The document gives some of the history of MIME and its introduction
and use in the web <a class='info' href='#history'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>History</span><span>)</span></a>. It then describes some
of the current difficulties with the use of MIME in the web context
<a class='info' href='#problems'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Problems with application to the Web</span><span>)</span></a>.  This background and context is then
followed by a description of changes which would reduce some of those
difficulties; the changes involve specifications, practices, and
registries within IETF and W3C <a class='info' href='#changes'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Recommendations</span><span>)</span></a>. In
particular, changes to the registry and maintenance procedures for
MIME-related registries maintained by IANA are describes.
</p>
<p>Currently, discussion of this document is suggested on the mailing
list www-tag@w3c.org (mailing list open for subscription to all),
archives at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/.
</p>
<p>NOTE: This document is still quite rough; some of the facts
need to be checked, many sections still need expansion. Any

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Origins of MIME</h3>

<p>MIME ("Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions") was invented
originally for email, based on general principles of "messaging" (a
foundational architecture framework). The role of MIME was to extend
Internet email messaging from ASCII-only plain text, to include other
character sets, images, rich documents, etc.)  <a class='info' href='#RFC1521'>[RFC1521]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Borenstein, N. and N. Freed, &ldquo;MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC1522'>[RFC1522]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moore, K., &ldquo;MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1993.</span><span>)</span></a>.

The basic architecture of complex content messaging is:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Message sent from A to B. 
</li>
<li>Message includes some data. Sender A includes standard 'headers'
telling recipient B enough information that recipient B knows how
sender A intends the message to be interpreted. 
</li>
<li>Recipient B gets the message, interprets the headers for the data
and uses it as information on how to interpret the data. 
</li>
</ul><p>

</p>
<p>MIME is a "tagging and bagging" specification:

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>tagging:</dt>
<dd>How to label content so the intent of how the
content should be interpreted is known.
</dd>
<dt>bagging:</dt>
<dd>How to wrap the content so the label is clear,
or, if there are multiple parts to a single message, how to combine
them.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>"MIME types" (renamed "Internet Media Types" in later specs <a class='info' href='#RFC2046'>[RFC2046]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freed, N. and N. Borenstein, &ldquo;Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>) are part of the "tagging" -- a way to describe
the content of a message so that it could be used to initiate
interpretation of a message. The "Internet Media Type registry" (MIME
type registry) is where someone can tell the world what a particular
label means, as far as the sender's intent of how recipients should
process a message of that type, and the description of a recipients
capability and ability for senders.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Introducing MIME into the Web</h3>

<p>The original World Wide Web (the 0.9 version of HTTP, see <a class='info' href='#RFC1945'>[RFC1945]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Berners-Lee, T., Fielding, R., and H. Nielsen, &ldquo;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>) didn't have "tagging and bagging" -- everything
sent via HTTP was assumed to be HTML.

However, at the time (early 1990's) other distributed information
access systems, including Gopher (distributed menu system) and WAIS
(remote access to document databases) were adding capabilities for
accessing many things other text and hypertext and the WWW folks were
considering type tagging.  It was agreed that HTTP should use MIME as
the vocabulary for talking about file types and character sets.  The
result was that HTTP 1.0 added the "content-type" header, following
(more or less) MIME. Later, for content negotiation, additional uses
of this technology (in 'Accept' headers) were also added.

</p>
<p>

The differences between the use of Internet Media Types between email
and HTTP have minor:

 </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>default charset: HTTP specified ISO-8859-1 as the default character set,
  not US-ASCII
</li>
<li> requirement for CRLF in plain text: in practice, web clients didn't
   restrict content to use CRLF in text/* MIME bodies.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These minor differences have caused a lot of trouble.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Distributed Extensibility</h3>

<p style='text-align: center'>The real advantage of using Internet Media Types to label
   content meant that the Web was no longer restricted to a single
   format. This one addition meant expanding from Global Hypertext to
   Global Hypermedia (as suggested in <a class='info' href='#connolly92'>a 1992
   email<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connolly, D., &ldquo;Global Hypermedia,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a> [connolly92])
</p><table class="full" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<col align="left">
<tr>
<td align="left">The Internet currently serves as the backbone for a global
   hypertext. FTP and email provided a good start, and the gopher,
   WWW, or WAIS clients and servers make wide area information
   browsing simple. These systems even interoperate, with email
   servers talking to FTP servers, WWW clients talking to gopher
   servers, on and on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">This currently works quite well for text.  But what should WWW
  clients do as Gopher and WAIS servers begin to serve up pictures,
  sounds, movies, spreadsheet templates, postscript files, etc.? It
  would be a shame for each to adopt its own multimedia typing
  system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">If they all adopt the MIME typing system (and as many other
features from MIME as are appropriate), we can step from global
hypertext to global hypermedia that much easier.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br clear="all" />

<p>The fact that HTTP could reliably transport images of different
formats, for example, allowed NCSA to add &lt;img&gt; to HTML. MIME
allowed other document formats (Word, PDF, Postscript) and other kinds
of hypermedia, as well as other applications, to be part of the
Web. MIME was arguably the most important extensibility mechanism in
the Web.

Lack of clarity</h3>

<p> Many people are confused about the purpose of MIME in the Web, its
uses, the meaning of Internet Media Types. Many W3C specifications TAG
findings and Internet Media Type registrations make what are incorrect
assumptions about the meaning and purposes of a Internet Media Type
registration.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Differences between email and Web delivery</h3>

<p>Some of the differences between the application contexts of email
and Web delivery determine different requirements:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
In the Web, the transfer of data is initiated differently than in
email: the "messages" with labeled content are usually HTTP responses
to a specific (GET) request (although the request is itself a message,
GET has no content). In the most common case, then, the receiver knows
more about the data before it has been sent. 
</li>
<li> Clients would like to know more about the content before they
retrieve it. The "tagging" is often not sufficient to know, for
example, "can I interpret this if I retrieve it", because of
versioning, capabilities, or dependencies on things like screen size
or interaction capabilities of the recipient. 
</li>
<li> Some content isn't delivered over the HTTP (files on local file
system), or there is no opportunity for tagging (data delivered over
FTP) and in those cases, some other ways are needed for determining
file type.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating systems use (and continued to evolve) different systems
to determine the 'type' of something, different from the MIME tagging
and bagging:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>'magic numbers': in many contexts, file types could be guessed
pretty reliably by looking for headers. 
</li>
<li>Originally MAC OS had a 4 character 'file type' and another 4
character 'creator code' for file types. 
</li>
<li> Windows evolved to use the "file extension" -- 3 letters (and then
more) at the end of the file name -- as the initial determination of
the oveall type of a file. This practice has now extended to other
systems.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Information about these other ways of determining type (rather than
by the content-type label) were gathered for the Internet Media Type
registry; those registering types are encouraged to also describe
'magic numbers', Mac file type, common file extensions. However, since
there was no formal use of that information, the quality of that
information in the registry is haphazard.
</p>
<p>Finally, there was the fact that tagging and bagging might be OK
for unilaterally initiated (one-way) messaging, you might want to know
whether you could handle the data before reading it in and
interpreting it, but the Internet Media Types weren't enough to tell.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
The Rules Weren't Quite Followed</h3>

<p> The behavior of the community when the Internet Media Type
registry was designed hasn't matched expectations:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Lots of file types aren't registered (no entry in IANA for file
types).
</li>
<li>Those that are, the registration is incomplete or incorrect (people
doing registration didn't understand 'magic number' or other
fields).
</li>
<li>The actual content deployed or created by deployed software doesn't
match the registration.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, Web implementations of Internet Media Types diverged
from expected behavior:
     
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Browser implementors would be liberal in what they accepted, and
use what looked like a file extension in the URL and/or magic number
or other 'sniffing' techniques to decide file type, without assuming
content-label was authoritative. This was necessary anyway for files
that weren't delivered by HTTP. 
</li>
<li>HTTP server implementors and administrators didn't supply ways of
easily associating the 'intended' file type label with the file,
resulting in files frequently being delivered with a label other than
the one they would have chosen if they'd thought about it, and if
browsers *had* assumed content-type was authoritative.  Some popular
servers had default configuration files that treated any unknown type
as "text/plain" (plain ext in ASCII). Since it didn't matter (the
browsers worked anyway), it was hard to get this fixed. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Incorrect senders coupled with liberal readers wind up feeding a
negative feedback loop based on the robustness principle (<a class='info' href='#WikiRobust'>[WikiRobust]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Robustness principle,&rdquo; 2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC3117'>[RFC3117]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rose, M., &ldquo;On the Design of Application Protocols,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Consequences</h3>

<p>The result, alas, is that increased unreliability, in that 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>servers sending responses to browsers don't have a good guarantee that the browser won't "sniff" the content and decide to do something other than treat it as it is labeled
</li>
<li>browsers receiving content don't have a good guarantee that the content isn't mis-labeled 
</li>
<li>intermediaries (gateways, proxies, caches, and other pieces of the Web infrastructure) don't have a good way of telling what the conversation means.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>This ambiguity and 'sniffing' also applies to packaged content in webapps ('bagging' but using ZIP rather than MIME multipart). (NOTE: NEEDS EXPANSION, REFERENCE TO WEBAPPS)

<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h3>3.5.&nbsp;
The Down Side of Extensibility</h3>

<p>
Extensibility adds great power, and allows the Web to evolve without committee approval of every extension. For some (those who want to extend and their clients who want those extensions), this is power! For others (those who are building Web components or infrastructure), extensibility is a drawback -- it adds to the unreliability and difference of the Web experience. When senders use extensions recipients aren't aware of, implement incorrectly or incompletely, then communication often fails.  With messaging, this is a serious problem, although most 'rich text' documents are still delivered in multiple forms (using multipart/alternative).
</p>
<p>
If your job is to support users of a popular browser, however, where each user has installed a different configuration of file handlers and extensibility mechanisms, MIME may appear to add unnecessary complexity and variable experience for users of all but the most popular types.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
There are related problems with charsets</h3>

<p>MIME includes provisions not only for file 'types', but also, importantly the "character encoding" used by text types: for example, simple US ASCII, Western European ISO-8859-1, Unicode UTF8. A similar vicious cycle also happened with character set labels: mislabeled content happily processed correctly by liberal browsers encouraged more and more sites to proliferate text with  mis-labeled character sets, to the point where browsers feel they *have* to guess the wrong label. (NEEDS EXPANSION)
</p>
<p>There are sites that intentionally label content as
iso-2022-jp or euc-jp when it is in fact one of the Microsoft extension
charsets (e.g., for access to circled digits. This is an intentional
misuse of the definitions of the charsets themselves -- definitions which
originated at the national standards body level.

Additional Use Cases: Polyglot and Multiview</h3>

<p>
There are some interesting additional use cases which add to the design requirements:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> "Polyglot" documents:  A 'polyglot' document is one which is some data which can be treated as two different Internet Media Types, in the case where the meaning of the data is the same. This is part of a transition strategy to allow content providers (senders) to manage, produce, store, deliver the same data, but with two different labels, and have it work equivalently with two different kinds of receivers (one of which knows one Internet Media Type, and another which knows a second one.) This use case was part of the transition strategy from HTML to an XML-based XHTML, and also as a way of a single service offering both HTML-based and XML-based processing (e.g., same content useful for news articles and Web pages. 
</li>
<li>"Multiview" documents: This use case seems similar but it's quite different. In this case, the same data has very different meaning when served as two different content-types, but that difference is intentional; for example, the same data served as text/html is a document, and served as an RDFa type is some specific data.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
Evolution, Versioning, Forking</h3>

<p>The subject of format/language/type evolution is complex; this section is a litle terse.
</p>
<p>Formats and their specifications evolve over time. There are several reasons for the evolution: innovation, compatibility with other implementations, attempts to gain control.  
</p>
<p>Some times new evolutions are "compatible", although compatibility has several variations. It is part of the responsibility of the designer of a new version of a file type to try to insure both forward and backward compatibility: new documents work reasonably (with some fallback) with old viewers and that old documents work reasonably with new viewers. In some cases this is accomplished, others not; in some cases, "works reasonably" is softened to "either works reasonably or gives clear warning about nature of problem (version mismatch)." 
</p>
<p>In MIME, the 'tag', the Internet Media Type, corresponds to the versioned series. Internet Media Types do not identify a particular version of a file format. Rather, the general idea is that the Internet Media Type identifies the family, and also how you're supposed to otherwise find version information on a per-format basis. Many (most) file formats have an internal version indicator, with the idea that you only need a new Internet Media Type to designate a completely incompatible format. The notion of an "Internet Media Type" is very course-grained. The general approach to this has been that the actual Media Type includes provisions for version indicator(s)  embedded in the content itself to determine more precisely the nature of how the data is to be interpreted.  That is, the message itself contains further information. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lots has gone wrong in this scenario as well -- processors ignoring version indicators encouraging content creators to not be careful to supply correct version indicators, leading to lots of content with wrong version indicators. 
</p>
<p>Those updating an existing Internet Media Type registration to account for new versions are admonished to not make previously conforming documents non-conforming. This is harder to enforce than would seem, because the previous specifications are not always accurate to what the Internet Media Type was used for in practice.
</p>
<p>(NOTE: MULTIPLE INCOMPATIBLE AUTHORITATIVE SPECS)

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h3>4.5.&nbsp;
Content Negotiation</h3>

<p> The general idea of content negotiation is when party A communicates to party B, and the message can be delivered in more than one format (or version, or configuration), there can be some way of allowing some negotiation, some way for A to communication to B the available options, and for B to be able to accept or indicate preferences.

</p>
<p>
Content negotiation happens all over. When one fax machine twirps to another when initially connecting, they are negotiating resolution, compression methods and so forth. In Internet mail, which is a one-way communication, the "negotiation" consists of the sender preparing and sending multiple versions of the message, one in text/html, one in text/plain, for example, in sender-preference order. The recipient then chooses the first version it can understand.

</p>
<p>
HTTP added "Accept" and "Accept-language" to allow content negotiation in HTTP GET, based on Internet Media Types, and there are other methods explained in the HTTP spec.

<a name="rfc.section.4.6"></a><h3>4.6.&nbsp;
Fragment identifiers</h3>

<p> The Web added the notion of being able to address part of a
content and not the whole content by adding a 'fragment identifier' to
the URL that addressed the data. Of course, this originally made sense
for the original Web with just HTML, but how would it apply to other
content. The URL spec glibly noted that "the definition of the
fragment identifier meaning depends on the Internet Media Type", but
unfortunately, few of the Internet Media Type definitions included this
information, and practices diverged greatly.
</p>
<p>If the interpretation of fragment identifiers depends on the MIME
type, though, this really crimps the style of using fragment
identifiers differently if content negotiation is wanted.

Recommendations</h3>

<p>This section outlines the kinds of changes needed to bring the MIME
system in line with current practice and to address the problems
outlined above. The purpose of this text is not to specify the exact
details of how changes can be accomplished, but rather to find broad
aggreement.
</p>
<p>We need a clear direction on how to make the Web more reliable, not
less. We need a realistic transition plan from the unreliable Web to
the more reliable one. Part of this is to encourage senders (Web
servers) to mean what they say, and encourage recipients (browsers) to
give preference to what the senders are sending.
</p>
<p>We should try to create specifications for protocols and best
practices that will lead the Web to more reliable and secure
communication. To this end, we give an overall architectural approach
to use of MIME, and then specific specifications, for HTTP clients and
servers, Web Browsers in general, proxies and intermediaries, which
encourage behavior which, on the one hand, continues to work with the
already deployed infrastructure (of servers, browsers, and
intermediaries), but which advice, if followed, also improves the
operability, reliability and security of the Web.
</p>
<p>This section outlines requirements for standards and practices intended to address some of the difficulties. This is an early version, which mainly  contains "strawman" proposals for changes. It is intended to stimulate discussion -- however, the hope is that we can get agreement about the nature of the problems and current situation before focusing in detail about possible solutions. However, having at least strawman proposals seems to be helpful. For some problems, additional changes to IETF and W3C specifications are also be advisable; the expectations are briefly outlined here.
