Abstract

   This document provides an IANA Considerations section that will be
   included in a future revision of the RSVP (Resource Reservation
   Protocol) specification, RFC 2205 [RSVP97].  Meanwhile, this document
   should be used to perform protocol parameter assignment for the RSVP
   protocol.

Internet Draft          RSVP IANA Considerations              April 1999

1. Introduction

   The responsible Internet authority (presently called the IANA) should
   assign values to RSVP protocol parameters using rules presented in
   this document, which uses the terminology of BCP 26 [Guide98].

   The contents of this document will become the IANA Considerations
   section in a future revision of the RSVP (Resource Reservation
   Protocol) specification, RFC 2205 [RSVP97].

2. IANA Considerations

   2.1 Message Type (or Msg Type)

      Message Type is an 8-bit number that identifies the function of
      the RSVP message.  Its values fall into the following ranges:

         0          Illegal value
         1-127      Assigned by IANA with IETF Consensus.
         128-191    Assigned by IANA using First-Come-First-Served
         192-255    Private usage.

   2.2 Class Number (or Class Num)

      Class Number is an 8-bit number that identifies a class of data
      objects to be carried in an RSVP message.  Within each such class,
      an 8-bit Class Type number (below) further specifies the
      particular object type.

      The two high-order bits of the Class Number are used to encode the
      desired behavior when an RSVP implementation receives a message
      containing an object whose Class Number it does not understand
      [RFC2205].  In the following table: bits "x" are to be assigned by
      the IANA.  The bit "r" is currently required to have the value 1.

         Class
         Number      Behavior     Meaning
         Range
         ________    ________     _____________________________________
         0xxxxxxx    REJECT       RSVP rejects the RSVP message and
                                      sends an RSVP error message.

         10rxxxxx    IGNORE       RSVP silently ignores the object and
                                      does not forward it.

         11xxxxxx    FORWARD      RSVP silently ignores the object but
                                      forwards it.

Internet Draft          RSVP IANA Considerations              April 1999

      The following table shows the behavior and IANA assignment rule
      for each sub-range of the Class Number value:

         0-80        REJECT; assigned by IANA with IETF Consensus.
         81-127      REJECT; assigned by IANA using First-Come-First-Served
         128-159     (Reserved)
         160-191     IGNORE; assigned by IANA with IETF Consensus.
         192-223     FORWARD; assigned by IANA with IETF Consensus.
         224-255     FORWARD; assigned by IANA using First-Come-First-Served

   2.3 Class Type

      Class Type is an 8-bit number that is assigned distinctly for each
      Class Number.

         0           Illegal value
         1-127       Assigned by IANA with IETF Consensus.
         128-191     Assigned by IANA using First-Come-First-Served
         192-255     Private usage.

   2.4 Virtual Destination Port (vDstPort)

      Virtual Destination Port is a 16-bit value number is used in
      objects with the SESSION Class Number and the IPv4/GPI or IPv6/GPI
      Class Type.  Values of this quantity are assigned using the
      following rules:

         0            Illegal Value
         1-10         Reserved.  Contact authors of RFC 2207.
         11-8191      Assigned by IANA using First-Come-First-Served.
         8192-65535   Reserved for dynamic allocation.

      For values assigned by IANA, the rules are those for UDP port
      assignment: the requestor must provide (a) a Point of Contact, (b)
      a brief description of the intended use, and (c) a short name to
      be associated with the assignment.

   2.5 Error Code

      This 8-bit number indicates the basic type of error.  New values
      should be assigned using Expert Review.  A document must be
      submitted that defines the precise meaning of the error code and
      the accompanying Error Value field.

   2.6 Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Code

      These sub-codes form the low-order 12 bits of a 16-bit Error Value
      of the form:

Braden & Zhang          Expiration: October 1999                [Page 3]

Internet Draft          RSVP IANA Considerations              April 1999

         0000xxxxxxxxxxxx

      New sub-code values of this form should be assigned using Expert
      Review [Guide98], and a document must be submitted that defines
      their precise meaning.  Currently assigned Error Code values
      include the following for which additional globally defined error
      value sub-codes may be defined:

      o    Error Code = 01: Admission control failure.

      o    Error Code = 12: Service preemption.

      o    Error Code = 21: Traffic control error.

      In addition, new error codes may be defined in the future that
      expand this list; they must be fully and explicitly documented.
