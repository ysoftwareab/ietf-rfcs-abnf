Internet-Draft          PCP Design Considerations         September 2010


1.  Introduction

   NAT-PMP [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp] is a lightweight, UDP-based request/
   response protocol that forms a good basis to obtain mappings from a
   NAT.  This document describes how NAT-PMP can be extended to support
   a large-scale NAT (such as deployed by an ISP, [I-D.nishitani-cgn]),
   support NAT64, and provide sufficient support to interwork between
   UPnP IGD [UPnP-IGD] and PCP.

   This document is for discussion purposes.  It is not intended to be
   published as an RFC.


2.  Design Considerations

2.1.  Add IPv6 Support

   Needs to support NAT44, NAPT44, stateless and stateful NAT64, NAT46,
   and IPv6 firewall.

2.2.  Open Pinhole for Another Host

   Provide ability for another device, within same home, to open ports
   on behalf of another.  This functionality also intended to be used by
   the operator of the NAT itself (e.g., the ISP) which is accessed by
   their technical support staff or is accessed by the end user.

   Use 0 as internal IP address to indicate 'this IP SRC address'.

2.3.  Interworking with UPnP IGD

   In UPnP IGD, a 'control point' can request a specific port or can
   request a wildcard port, and there is no concept of a mapping
   lifetime.  This model does not work well with NATs, especially large
   scale NATs.

              Figure 1: UPnP IGD to PCP Interworking Function

2.3.1.  Creating a mapping

   The Madatory bit, from draft-wing-softwire-port-control-protocol is
   not necessary, and will not be used in PCP.  We had a lengthy
   discussion on this during our design meetings.  The primary benefit
   of this bit is to ease interworking between UPnP IGD and PCP.  As
   most people are aware, UPnP IGD mandates that UPnP IGD gateways
   implement the ability for a UPnP 'control point' (the computer inside
   the home) to obtain a mapping for a specific port.  UPnP IGD includes
   optional support for the control point to request 'any' port, which
   allows the UPnP IGD gateway to choose the port number.  However, this
   ability to request 'any' port seems to not be commonly used by UPnP
   IGD control points, is not available in the Windows UPnP API, and
   appears to also not be commonly implemented in UPnP IGD gateways
   (NATs).  Thus, most UPnP IGD applications request a specific port.
   On a NAT with a lot of activity, such as a large scale NAT, any
   specific port number is probably already in use by another
   subscriber, so the UPnP IGD model does not work well.

   In our experience, UPnP IGD applications or the underlying library
   will attempt to try port+1, port+2, and so on.  However, we can't
   recommend this behavior [draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization].

   Thus, to interwork from UPnP IGD to PCP, our recommendation is that
   every UPnP request be forwarded to the PCP server.  This works if the
   UPnP control point is incrementing the source port number, and also
   works if the UPnP control point is randomly choosing the source port
   number, and also works if it chooses 'any'.  The UPnP IGD/PCP
   interworking function would request very short leases (e.g., 5
   seconds) in order to avoid the chatter of a DELETE message
   (lifetime=0).  Once a port can be allocated, its lifetime is
   extended.  When interworking with UPnP IGD, the in-home CPE limits
   itself to sending one PCP message a second, which ensures there are

   only 5 outstanding PCP reserverations at a time; this avoids
   consuming all of that subscriber's NAT mappings while trying to find
   an available port via the UPnP IGD->PCP interworking function).

      Note: for this to work successfully, the PCP server (large NAT)
      make an attempt to honor the requested-external-port field in the
      PCP request.

                  Message flow would be similar to this:

2.3.2.  Lifetime Maintenance

   UPnP IGD does not provide a lifetime, so the UPnP IGD/PCP
   interworking function is responsible for extending the lifetime of
   mappings that are still interesting to the UPnP IGD device.  We
   recommend the UPnP IGD/PCP function request a port mapping lifetime
   equal to the client's remaining DHCP lifetime.  Th UPnP IGD/PCP
   interworking function is responsible for renewing the PCP lifetime as
   necessary.  As long as client renews its DHCP lease, the PCP lifetime

Internet-Draft          PCP Design Considerations         September 2010


   should also be extended.  For clients not using DHCP, ping, ARP, or
   WiFi association can be used to discern liveliness of the UPnP IGD
   control point.  It is not recommended to attempt to connect to the
   TCP or UDP port opened on the control point to determine if the host
   still wants to receive packets; the server could be temporarily down
   when tested, causing a false negative.

2.4.  Protocol support

   Only TCP and UDP will be supported.  Additional protocols can be
   defined later, using the protocol field.

2.5.  Delete all mappings for a host

   PCP will allow deleting all mappings for a host.  (This is already
   present in NAT-PMP.)

2.6.  Delete all mappings for all hosts in a home

   PCP will allow deleting all mappings for all hosts behind an in-home
   CPE, such as DS-Lite's "B4" element.  This is to allow flushing PCP
   mappings when a subscriber is assigned an IP address belonging to a
   previous subscriber.

2.7.  No Reservation of Ports in other protocol

   When a port reservation is made, NAT-PMP currently reserves the same
   port in the other transport protocol for the same host.  That is, if
   a mapping is made for TCP/12345, the port UDP/12345 will be reserved
   for a future mapping.  This functionality will be removed from PCP.

   If a protocol requires the same mapping for UDP and TCP, it will need
   to issue separate requests (with short lifetimes) until it is
   assigned the same ports.

2.8.  Consolidate IP request and port request messages

   NAT-PMP currently uses a separate message to obtain the public IP
   address and to obtain the port.  In PCP, this will be consolidated
   into one message so that every port response includes the external
   address and lifetime.  Once a host has an active PCP-created mapping
   on one port, it will get the same external address for all subsequent
   port requests.

2.9.  NAT Changing Public Mapping

   Currently, NAT-PMP has a feature where the NAT can alert hosts on the
   local LAN if the NAT's public address changed or the NAT rebooted.

Internet-Draft          PCP Design Considerations         September 2010


   This functionality will not be available in the initial functionality
   of PCP, but can be provided in a future document.

2.10.  Epoch

   As in NAT-PMP, all NATs will implement epoch.  NATs which retain
   their state will simply increase the epoch.  This reduces
   implementation burden to deal with NATs-that-retain-state and NATs-
   which-lose-state, and also allows ISPs to renumber the public side of
   the NAT (and force epoch back to zero).

2.11.  PCP Server Discovery

   Currently we are considering a new DHCP option which indicates the
   PCP server's address, with a fallback to using the default gateway's
   address as the PCP server if the DHCP option isn't available.

   This requires the default gateway to support PCP -- either by
   processing PCP packets (or tunneling them), or by handling the new
   DHCP option.

   DHCP option is vulnerable to accidental or malicious breakage if the
   incorrect PCP server is sent in the DHCP option.

2.12.  Port number

   Re-use the same port as NAT-PMP (5351).


3.  Security Considerations

   TBD.


4.  IANA Considerations

   Re-use the IANA-assigned port number for NAT-PMP, 5351, changing its
   reference to read:

   pcp 5351/tcp   Port Control Protocol (was NAT Port Mapping Protocol)
   pcp 5351/udp   Port Control Protocol (was NAT Port Mapping Protocol)
