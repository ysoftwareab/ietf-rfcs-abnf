2. Abstract

This document defines the format of a new Resource Record (RR) namely
GL for the Domain Naming System (DNS), and reserves a corresponding
DNS type mnemonic and numerical code. This definition deals with
associating geographical host location mappings to host names within a
domain.


The key words "MUST", "MUST  NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL  NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD  NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY"  and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. Introduction

   The ideal way to manage and maintain a database of information, such as
   geographical location of Internet hosts, is to delegate responsibility
   to local domain administrators.

   This document resolves the problem of relating host information within
the
   DNS to geographical locations. This definition has been designed to be
easy
   for the person who administrates DNS for a domain. The author hopes that
the
   lack of requiring longitude, latitude and elevation information and
merely
   being able to enter address information, as you would address a postal
   letter, will mean broad acceptance and use of the GL resource record.

   The availability of geographical location information will immediately be
   able to benefit applications in network management, which would enhance
   and supplement various network tools which currently exist.

   The Domain Name System is ideally suited to provide geographic location
   information.  The information we desire to make available globally needs
to
   be maintained and updated locally (perfect for DNS).

   Although several other attempts by various authors have attempted to
created
   resource records that would allow location information on host to be
stored
   and distributed, none, to the authors knowledge, have either gained
   acceptance on a wide scale or made allowance for location information
that
   is not with the confines of the planet Earth.

4. The GL format

   GL has the following format:

      <owner> <ttl> <class> GL <Rdata>


4.1 Rdata Format

  Rdata has the following format:

   <string> <string>

   The format of the RDATA field is two character varying length
   strings seperated by a space character. The first, the hierarchical
   locator, then an address string. Each is quoted (like all strings)
   only when it has spaces in it, which will never be true for the first
   string, and almost always for the second.

4.1.1 The Hierarchical Locator

The Hierarchical Locator contains the following components (each separated
by a period "."):

  Astronomical Location -                          (Required)
           A coded field defining the heavenly body within
           the known Universe, where the machine resides.  A complete list
may
           be referenceable at a later date.

           The most common entry, "S3" is the planet Earth and is the only
currently
           defined location.

  Country Code -                                   (Required)

          The country code specifies the country the host computer resides
          in. The code is a two character fixed length string.  These codes
          are defined in document ISO 3166-1 and are listed in Appendix A
          for easy reference.

   Postal Zone -                                    (Optional)

          This rdata component supplies the postal code (Zip Code) for the
          location the host computer resides. For countries that have a
          multi-segmented postal coding system, the segments should be
          separated by period(s) ".".

          This field may be omitted only if the country in which the host
          machine resides does not use a postal coding system.

   When all three Hierarchical Locator components exist for an DNS entry,
the
   position being defined is considered to be a "precise position".


 4.2 The Quoted String

  This string should be entered as you would enter an address on
  a postal letter within the country specified by the Hierarchical
  Locator. The country code information should not be included within
  the quoted string. This string is always required and must be
  present in the RDATA field.

  The quoted string may be used for both visual reference of the
  physical address as well as by a software application to help
  determine a more precise location of the host machine, if the
  Hierarchical Locator lacks sufficient precision.

  The only instance in which any application should attempt to
  interpret the quoted string is in a case where the country
  code defines a country that does not use, or has not implemented
  a postal code system.


Costanzo                                                          [Page  3]

  No software or application should attempt to override a precise
  position defined by the Hierarchical Locator with information
  defined within the quoted string data.



 5. Example(s)

     Example 1 (with a postal zone defined):

            donuts A 192.188.192.1
               GL S3.US.45420.1910 "1425 Arbor Avenue, Dayton OH"

        Example 2 (no postal zone):

           lorinda A 129.122.1.1
               GL S3.SR "Marthastrasse 64, Shawproject, Uitvlug, Parimaribo"

     Example 3

; Authoritative data for akc.net.
;
; note in this example:
;    uspring, diana and martha (even though the complete postal code was
;    not entered) are precisely defined
;
;    lorinda, resides in the country of SURINAME, which has not implemented
;    a postal coding system.
