Abstract

   A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control of
   hierarchical Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER].
   However, support of address separation as allowed by the
   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture [G.8080]
   is not covered by [HIER]. This internet draft describes additional
   requirements to consider for the use of LSP hierarchy in ASON
   networks and proposes extensions to address those requirements.

1. Introduction and Problem Statement

   This problem statement applies to the operation of multilayer
   networks according to the ASON architecture.

   [HIER] defines a set of extensions for the control of hierarchical
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This internet draft describes
   additional requirements for the use of LSP Hierarchy in ASON
   networks.

   1.1. Separate control plane instances at different layers

   In ASON architecture, the control plane instance in a client layer
   may be a separate instance than the control plane instance for the
   client layer. This requires that when a server layer link is
   created, sufficient information must be passed to allow a new
   control (signaling and optionally routing) association to be created
   between the client control instances at the ends of the new link.
   This includes identification and addressing information for both the
   signaling control instance and routing control instance at each end.

   The ASON architecture [G.8080] allows for separate control plane
   instances for each controlled layer. In a real deployment, this can
   be seen in a few scenarios. For example, in networks mixing legacy
   equipment and emerging technologies, existing legacy control plane
   for some layers and new control plane for other layers may be based
   on different protocols, requiring different instances.

   Additionally, some equipment may be entirely under management plane
   control whereas other is under control plane. There might also be
   business boundaries due to mergers and acquisitions or due to
   internal company organization. In these cases, the result is
   multiple instances of control plane.

   Another scenario is that different instances may be used to solve
   scalability problems.

   1.2. Address and identifier separation within a layer

   Separate identification of routing controller instances, signaling
   controller instances and resource identifiers is required in order
   to support ASON signaling and routing.  Separation of routing
   controller and resource identifier is already addressed as a
   requirement in [RFC4652], as referenced by the terms ''Li'' and ''Pi''
   for the logical control plane entity and physical node identifiers,
   respectively.  This allows 1:n relationships between the control
   entity and the physical resources being controlled, for example.

   Separation of routing and signaling controller identifiers and their
   respective reachable addresses allows the routing and signaling
   controller identifiers to be independent of the specific network
   address by which they are reached. This allows the operator to
   modify the signaling communications network addressing scheme
   without impacting the control plane protocols. Routing controller
   addressing is further discussed in [RFC4258].

2. Requirements

   2.1. Routing Controller Identification

   In ASON architecture, a routing controller possesses two
   identifiers. The first is the Routing Controller Protocol Controller
   Identifier (RC PC ID). The second is the IPv4 address at which the
   routing controller can be reached, the Routing Controller Protocol
   Controller Signaling Control Network address (RC PC SCN address).

   New requirement: It must be possible to exchange RC PC IDs and RC PC
   SCN addresses for the establishment of a routing adjacency in the
   client layer.

   2.2. Signaling Controller Identification

   In ASON architecture, signaling controller identifiers cannot be
   automatically derived from routing controller identifiers. In order
   to establish an RSVP-TE signaling adjacency between two client
   signaling controllers, a signaling mechanism is required in the
   server layer to identify the signaling controller. Each signaling
   controller requires two identifiers. The first is the Signaling
   Controller Protocol Controller Identifier (SC PC ID). The second is
   the IPv4 address at which the signaling controller can be reached,
   the Signaling Controller Protocol Controller Signaling Control
   Network address (SC PC SCN address).

   New Requirement: It must be possible to exchange SC PC IDs and SC PC
   SCN addresses for the establishment of a signaling adjacency in the
   client layer.

3. Mechanisms and Protocol Extensions

   This section defines protocol extensions to address the requirements
   described in the previous section.

3.1. LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID sub-TLVs

   The following sub-TLVs are optional sub-TLVs of the
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID, in addition to already defined Target IGP
   Identifier and Component Link Identifier TLV. These sub-TLVs allow
   the client layer to use separate routing and signaling controller
   identifiers and reachable addresses.
