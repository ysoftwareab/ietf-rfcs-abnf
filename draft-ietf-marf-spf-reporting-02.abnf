r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  MUST be a
      local-part or addr-spec (see Section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) specifying
      an e-mail address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail
      claiming to be from this domain (see Section 2.4 of [SPF] for a
      description of how domains are identified for SPF checks) has
      failed the evaluation algorithm described in [SPF], in particular
      because a message arrived via an unauthorized route.  The format
      of this reply MUST be in the format specified by the "rf=" tag
      defined below.  If only a local-part is provided, then to generate
      a complete address to which the report is sent, the verifier
      simply appends to this value an "@" followed by the SPF domain per
      paragraph 4.1 of [SPF]. r= modifiers in a record that was reached
      by following an include: mechanism MUST be ignored.

      ABNF:

spf-report-tag = %x72 "=" qp-section

rf=  Reporting Format (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "arf").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing
      desired reporting formats in decreasing order of preference.  Each
      element of the list MUST be a token that is taken from the
      registered list of report formats.  See
      [I-D.MARF-AUTHFAILURE-REPORT] for a description of recognized
      formats.  The verifier generating reports SHOULD generate a report
      using the first token in the list that represents a report format
      it is capable of generating.  If no supported formats are
      requested, then a report MUST not be sent.

      ABNF:

spf-rf-tag = %x72 %x66 "=" rep-format 0*( ":" rep-format )
ri=  Requested Report Interval (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "0").  The value is an unsigned 32-bit integer that specifies the
      number of incidents for which to skip reports, i.e. for a value of
      "1", every other report about a given type of incident (e.g.  SPF
      related) should be skipped.  A value of "0" requests a report for
      every incident.  Where the requested interval is not zero, the
      agent generating a report SHOULD include an "Incidents:" field in
      the generated report so the receiving agent has some indication of
      how many reports were suppressed.

      ABNF:

spf-ri-tag = %x72 %x69 "=" 1*DIGIT

ro=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 4.1 for a
      list of valid tags.

      ABNF:

spf-ro-type = ( "all" / "e" / "f" / "s" )

spf-ro-tag = %x72 %x6f "=" spf-ro-type 0* ( ":" spf-ro-type )

v=spf1 mx:example.org r=postmaster -all
