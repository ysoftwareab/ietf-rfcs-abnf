1  Introduction

   The interconnect settlement between the network operators is based on
   traffic settlement. Because of lack of Internet content resources,
   the service requests from the small operators usually are redirected
   to the large operators, which leads to the imbalanced traffic
   patterns between the small operators and the large operators and
   force the small operators to pay high cost of traffic settlement to
   the large operators.

   To cut short the expense of traffic settlement, deploying a local
   cache system on the point of interconnection and interworking between
   two operators is the most direct method taken by the small operators
   to localize the traffic by caching hot content and avoid cross-
   boundary expenses for subsequent requests for cached content
   retrievals.


2  Problem Statement 

   As stated earlier, cache systems are considered to be an effective
   way to reduce the prohibitive expense for cross-boundary traffic from
   large ISP with most ICPs to small ISPs providing local services to a
   specific group of subscribers. The cache system automatically buffers
   the hotspot resources locally and reduces the traffic from the large
   operators by feeding the requested content locally.

   However, observed from the reality of operating, the local cache
   system can't fully implement traffic localization, as there are vast
   user requests redirected to other operators by DNS, even when the
   requested content is actually cached locally. 

   The main reason is that the work pattern of cache system is fully
   passive and the cache system uses the DPI technology to acquire the
   URL to identify for buffered content and match them with subsequent
   content requests, which causes undesirable cache misses in the
   following two cases:

   On the one hand, for video websites using the anti-stealing-link
   mechanism, which updates the URL for the same content periodically
   with new ones, subsequent requests are therefore subject to change
   even from the same website. 

   On the other hand, for the requests from the local subscribers to
   different websites, the cache system cannot recognize a content hit
   even if the content they are requesting are identical, as their URLs
   are likely to be different.

3  Requirements

   In order to improve the hit ratio and actively push the hot resources
   to the local subscribers, the cache system need a succinct way to
   learn the buffered contents and can judge the hot content according
   to the actual content information. It is preferable that no influence
   to the current application and its protocols.

4  Discussion

   Content tagging is expected to be helpful to address these
   requirements. E.g. to mark the content information and encode this
   flag/tag into the content's URL, which identifies its binary content
   and other application metadata. The cache system can know the exact
   content by analyze the content flag in the URL link and need no
   changes to any protocol.
