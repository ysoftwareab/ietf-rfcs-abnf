Abstract

   RBridges use the TRILL protocol, which in turn makes use of an
   extended version of the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
   System) routing protocol to determine topology and frame forwarding.
   RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding with zero
   configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary
   loops, and multipathing for both unicast and multicast traffic.
   Rbridges also support VLANs. This document is an early specification
   of the details of TRILL use of IS-IS for purposes of discussion.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


1. Introduction

   [RBRIDGE] specifies the TRILL base protocol which provides optimal
   pair-wise forwarding with zero configuration, safe forwarding even
   during periods of temporary loops, and multipathing for both unicast
   and multicast traffic. Rbridges also support VLANs. The TRILL
   protocol, in turn, makes use of an extended version of the IS-IS
   [ISIS] protocol.  [ISIS-L2] specifies the general [ISIS] facilities
   to provide true link state routing to any protocol running directly
   over Layer 2.

   This is an early draft specification of details of TRILL use of IS-IS
   concentrating on IS-IS PDU content. It makes use of the Router
   Capabilities TLV [RFC4971] although perhaps some other TLV or a new
   TLV would be better in some cases.

   [RBRIDGE] specifies the TRILL enveloping of IS-IS PDUs and the flow
   of such PDUs along with the determination of Designated RBridges
   (DRBs, equivalent to Designated Intermediate Systems) and the like.

   {{Comments in double curly braces relate to version -02 of [ISIS-
   L2].}}



1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   The following other special words or acronyms are used in this
   document:

      AFI - IANA registered Address Family.

      PDU - Protocol Data Unit.

      RBridge - One of the devices which implement TRILL.  The second
         letter in Rbridge is case insensitive. Both Rbridge and RBridge
         are correct.

      TLV - Type, Length, Value. The general format of the data elements
         included as the content of IS-IS PDUs after their header.

      TRILL - The protocol specified partly in [RBRIDGE] and this
         document.

      ** - Indicates exponentiation. 2**12 is two to the twelfth power.

2. Separation of IS-IS Instances

   TRILL implements separate IS-IS instances from those used by layer 3,
   that is, different from the one used by IP routers.  It is important
   that these be distinguishable to avoid possible confusion that would
   occur if an IS-IS instance attempted to use IS-IS PDUs intended for a
   different instance.

   TRILL implements multiple instances of IS-IS for its own use.  One,
   mandatory instance, includes information such as basic connectivity
   between routers, location of VLANs, location of IP multicast routers.
   RBridges also optionally implement per-VLAN instances of TRILL IS-IS,
   to carry information about attached endnodes in that VLAN. Section
   2.1 explains how TRILL encodes IS-IS frames to ensure that there is
   no confusion between TRILL instances of IS-IS and layer 3 instances
   of IS-IS, and also, between the mandatory core instance of TRILL IS-
   IS and per-VLAN instances.



2.1 Protocol Separation of IS-IS Instances

   TRILL IS-IS Layer-2 frames differ from those for Layer 3 use of IS-IS
   and can not be accidentally confused with them as follows:

   1. TRILL IS-IS frames consist of an IS-IS frame enveloped within a
      frame that uses the TRILL Ethertype and has an inner multicast
      destination address of All-IS-IS-RBridges.

   2. Native frames for Layer-3 IS-IS are sent to either the AllL1ISs
      (01-80-C2-00-00-14) or AllL2ISs (01-80-C2-00-00-15) multicast
      addresses. TRILL frames which are enveloped Layer-3 IS-IS do NOT
      have All-IS-IS-RBridges as their inner destination address (it
      will be AllL1ISs or AllL2ISs) and so are treated as ordinary TRILL
      data frames

   3. TRILL uses a distinct, constant IS-IS Area Address that would
      never appear as a real Layer 3 IS-IS area address. This Area
      Address is the value zero. (See Section 4.1.)



2.2 Instance Separation of TRILL IS-IS Instances

   An RBridge campus may have up to 1 + 2**12 - 2 instances of TRILL IS-
   IS; that is, one mandatory core instance plus one optional instance
   per VLAN. VLANs are identified by a 12 bit field but the values 0x000
   and 0xFFF are not allowed so there are 2**12 - 2 possible VLANs.

   The multiple instance mechanism described in [ISIS-MI] is used to

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


   distinguish these TRILL IS-IS instances for convenience in cases
   where they are executed in one process on an Rbridge. In particular:

   1. All IS-IS PDUs for the mandatory core TRILL IS-IS instances MAY
      include the MI TLV with the instance number of zero, and

   2. All IS-IS PDUs for optional per VLAN TRILL IS-IS instances, MUST
      include the MI TLV with the instance number equal to their VLAN
      ID.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


3. IS-IS PDU Details

   [ISIS], as extended by [ISIS-L2], supports 4 types of PDUs: Hello,
   LSP, CSNP/PSNP, and MGROUP. TRILL aspects of the contents of each of
   the PDU types are listed below. Some specific TLVs are discussed in
   Section 4 below.

   All RBridges have a 6 octet System ID which is conveyed in the header
   of every TRILL IS-IS PDU they produce, just as it is Layer 3 IS-IS.
   The Maximum Area Addresses octet in the common fixed header is set to
   0x01. An RBridge campus is a single Level 1 IS-IS Area.

   Where some features of IS-IS assume a unique 32-bit Router ID for an
   RBridge this shall be the RBridge's 16-bit nickname right justified
   with 16 leading zero bits added. If the nickname is unknown, the
   entire Router ID field is zero.

   All TRILL IS-IS PDUs MAY contain an Authentication TLV (TLV #10).



3.1 Hello PDUs

   All TRILL Hello PDUs contain the TRILL Area Address TLV (see Section
   4.1). The Circuit Type two bit field of TRILL IS-IS Hello PDUs MUST
   be set to 0b01 indicating Level 1 only.

   Core TRILL IS-IS instance Hello PDUs MAY include one or more
   Capability TLVs [RFC4971] (TLV #242). The nickname of the sending
   RBridge appears in the Router ID field left filled with zeros. The D
   and S flags in the Capability TLV MUST be zero. Other information is
   included by instances of the following TRILL related subTLVs:

   1. Designated VLAN (subTLV #3.1a). This subTLV is included by the DRB
      to designate the VLAN to be used for communications between
      RBridges on the link. The length of the value is two octets. The
      lower 4 bits of the first octet give the upper VLAN ID bits and
      the second octet gives the lower VLAN ID bits. The upper 4 bits of
      the first octet are reserved and MUST be sent as zero and ignored
      on receipt.  In the absence of a Designated VLAN subTLV from the
      DRB, the Designated VLAN defaults to VLAN 1.

   2. Appointed Forwarders (subTLV #3.1b). This subTLV provides the
      mechanism by which the DRB can inform other RBridges on the link
      that they are the designated VLAN-x forwarder for that link for
      one or more ranges of VLAN IDs. The size of the value is 5*n
      octets where there are n appointments. Each 5 octet part of the
      value is formatted as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


        octet 1    octet 2    octet 3    octet 4    octet 5
      +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
      | Appointee Nickname  | Start VLAN ID  | End VLAN ID   |
      +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

      The VLAN range give is inclusive. To specify a single VLAN, that
      VLAN ID appears as both the start and end VLAN. An RBridge's
      nickname may occur as appointed forwarder for multiple VLAN ranges
      within the same or different router capability TLVs within the
      DRB's Hellos. In the absence of appointed forwarder subTLVs, the
      DRB act as the appointed forwarder.



3.2 LSP PDUs

   The TLVs to be included in TRILL LSP PDUs are very different for the
   mandatory core IS-IS instance of a campus, discussed in Section 3.2.1
   below, and in the optional per VLAN instances, discussed in section
   3.2.2 below.

   All TRILL LSP PDUs contain the TRILL Area Address TLV (see Section
   4.1). In addition, in the LSP header, the P Flag and Att flags MUST
   be zero and the IS type two bit field MUST be set to 0b01 indicating
   Level 1.



3.2.1 Core Instance LSP

   The contents of a core TRILL IS-IS instance LSP PDU includes:

   1. Information on reachable RBridge neighbors and the cost of the hop
      MUST be included via a normal IIS neighbors TLV (TLV #2).

   2. The RBridge nickname and other information via one or more
      Capability TLVs [RFC4971] (TLV #242). The nickname appears in the
      Router ID field left filled with zeros. The D and S flags in the
      Capability TLV MUST be zero. Other information is included by
      instances of the following TRILL related subTLVs:

      2.a Exactly one TRILL Flags subTLV MUST be present (subTLV
          #<tbd3.2.1a>). The length of the value of this subTLV is
          variable with a minimum size of 2 octets.  The first octet is
          the RBridge's nickname priority.  The top five bits of the
          second octet are defined as below. Additional bits may be
          specified in the future and those bits may extend into
          subsequence octets.  The value of all bits in any octets not
          present is assumed to be zero.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


             first octet      |   second  octet
                              |  0    1    2    3    4     5 - 7
          +-------------------+----+----+----+----+----+-----------+
          | nickname priority | V0 | V1 | V2 | V3 | RT | reserved  |
          +-------------------+----+----+----+----+----+-----------+

          V0 through V4 indicate support of TRILL Header Versions 0
          through 4. RT is the Request Tree flag. The remaining bits of
          the first octet (and all bits of subsequent octets if present)
          are reserved and MUST be zero when sent and ignored on
          receipt. Exactly one TRILL Flags subTLV must occur in the link
          state of every RBridge.

      2.b Tree Roots (subTLV #<tbd3.2.1b>).  The value is a variable
          length array of the nicknames of the RBridges which the
          originating RBridge might pick as the root of the distribution
          tree for multi-destination traffic for which it is the ingress
          RBridge. If the list is empty or not provided, the originating
          RBridge can only select itself (if its Request Tree flag is
          true) or the RBridge with the lowest System ID (if the
          originating RBridge's Request Tree flag is false).

      2.c VLANs (subTLV #<tbd3.2.1c>). The value of this subTLV consists
          of a VLAN range, flags, and a variable length list of spanning
          tree root bridge IDs. This subTLV may appear zero, one, or
          many times but the union of the VLAN ranges in all occurrences
          MUST be precisely the set of VLANs for which the originating
          RBridge is appointed forwarder for at least one link and the
          VLAN ranges in multiple VLANs subTLVs for an RBridge MUST NOT
          overlap.  That is, the intersection of the VLAN ranges for any
          pair of these subTLVs originated by an RBridge must be null.
          The value length is 4 + 6*n where n is the number of root
          bridge IDs.  The initial 4 octets of value are as follows:

             0    1    2    3     4 - 15      16 - 19     20 - 31
          +----+----+----+----+------------+----------+------------+
          | M4 | M6 | OM |  R | VLAN start | Reserved |  VLAN end  |
          +----+----+----+----+------------+----------+------------+

          The M4 bit indicates that there is an IPv4 multicast router on
          a link for which the originating RBridge is appointed
          forwarder for every VLAN in the indicated range. The M6 bit
          indicates the same for an IPv6 multicast router. The OM bit
          indicates that this RBridge requests that all non-IP derived
          multicast traffic in the indicated VLAN range be sent to it.
          The R and Reserved bits MUST be sent as zero and are ignored
          on receipt.

          The VLAN start and end IDs are inclusive. A range of one VLAN
          ID is indicated by setting them both to that VLAN ID value.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


          The list of zero or more spanning tree root bridge IDs is the
          set of root bridge IDs seen for all links which are in any of
          the VLANs in the range and for which the RBridge is appointed
          forwarder.  This information is learned from BPDUs heard by
          the RBridge.  If MSTP is in use on a link, the root bridge
          referred to is the CIST (common and internal spanning tree)
          root bridge. While, of course, only one spanning tree root
          should be see on any particular port, there may be multiple
          ports in the same VLAN connected to differed bridged LANs with
          different spanning tree roots. If no spanning tree roots can
          be seen on any of the links in any of the VLANs in the range
          indicated for which the RBridge is appointed forwarder (for
          example all such links are point-to-point links to other
          RBridges or to end stations so no BPDUs are received) then the
          listed set of spanning tree root IDs will be null.

          If there are any two VLANs in the range indicated for which
          the value of the M4, M6, or OM bits are different, the subTLV
          is incorrect and must be split into multiple subTLVs each
          indicating only VLANs with the same M4, M6, and OM values. If
          there are any two VLANs in the range indicated for which the
          set of root bridge IDs see on all links for which the RBridge
          is appointed forwarder for the VLAN are not the same, the
          subTLV is incorrect and must be split into multiple subTLVs
          each indicating only VLANs with the same set of DRB seen root
          bridge IDs. It is always safe to use subTLVs with a "range" of
          one VLAN ID but this may be too verbose.

      2.d VLAN Groups (subTLV #<tbd3.2.1d). The value of this optional
          subTLV consists of two or more 16-bit fields each of which has
          a VLAN ID in the low order 12 bits and the top 4 bits zero.
          The first such VLAN ID is the primary and the rest are
          secondary, as described in [RBRIDGE].  This subTLV may appear
          zero, one, or many times.



3.2.2 Per VLAN Instance LSP

   The TRILL information in per VLAN instance LSP PDUs consists of one
   or more ADDR TLVs [ISIS-L2]. Each ADDR TLV contains one or more AFI
   sub-TLVs with AFI type 6 (EUI-48).  Those AFI sub-TLVs list the
   unicast addresses of end stations on links for which the originating
   RBridge is appointed forwarder along with the one octet unsigned
   Confidence in this information with a value in the range 0-254.

   {{Either one octet of the "Reserved" 16 bits for the ADDR TLV needs
   to be used for the TRILL end station Confidence octet or an
   additional sub-TLV under the ADDR TLV needs to be defined to carry
   the Confidence.}}

INTERNET-DRAFT                                    RBridges: Use of IS-IS


   {{[ISIS-L2] currently says that ADDR TLVs can only occur in pseudo-
   node LSPs but, unless you generate a pseudo-node for every link, even
   a point-to-point link from an RBridge to an end station, it seems
   like they are associated with RBridges, not with pseudo-nodes.}}

   Each ADDR TLV MAY also contain a VLAN sub-TLV giving the VLAN of
   those end station addresses. However, this is not required because
   that VLAN information is also conveyed by the required MI TLV and
   also indicated by the Inner VLAN tag in the TRILL enveloping of the
   per-VLAN TRILL IS-IS PDU.

   {{The 32 bits provided for VLAN ID in [ISIS-L2] seems excessive. VLAN
   IDs are currently all 12 bits.}}



3.3 CSNP/PSNP PDUs

   CSNP stands for Complete Sequence Number Packet and PSNP for Partial
   Sequence Number Packet. These relate to the IS-IS link state flooding
   algorithm and link state sequence numbers.  There is no change from
   typical Layer-3 sequence number IS-IS PDUs except for the inclusion
   of instance separation TLVs as indicated in Section 2 above. Only
   Level 1 sequence number packets are used by TRILL IS-IS.



3.4 MGROUP PDUs

   MGROUP PDUs [ISIS-L2] are only sent as part of the core IS-IS
   instance. They contain one or more ADDR TLVs each of which, in turn,
   contains one or more AFI sub-TLVs with AFI number 6 (MAC-48). Those
   AFI sub-TLVs list the IP-derived multicast addresses for which there
   are listeners on links for which the originating RBridge is appointed
   forwarder.

   Each ADDR TLV MUST also contain a VLAN sub-TLV giving the VLAN of
   those multicast addresses. If there are IP-derived multicast
   listeners in more than one VLAN, then multiple ADDR TLVs must be
   originated by the RBridge.  This information must be in the core IS-
   IS instance so transit RBridges can perform optional multicast
   distribution optimization.

   {{The 32 bits provided for VLAN ID in [ISIS-L2] seems excessive. VLAN
   IDs are currently all 12 bits.}}

   All TRILL MGROUP PDUs contain the TRILL Area Address TLV (see Section
   4.1).

4. Specific TLVs

   This section describes particular TLVs included or not included in
   TRILL IS-IS PDUs.



4.1 Area Address

   The TRILL zero Area Address TLV is encoded as follows:

          +--------------------------+--------------------------+
          | 0x01 (Area Address TLV)  | 0x02 (Length of Value)   |
          +--------------------------+--------------------------+
          | 0x01 (Length of Address) | 0x00 (zero Area Address) |
          +--------------------------+--------------------------+



4.2 Protocols Supported

   Since no NLPID (Network Layer Protocol Identifier) has been allocated
   by the ISO/IEC TR 9577 Registry for the Ethernet protocol or MAC-48
   address type or TRILL, there is no way to indicate support of IS-IS
   routing for these in a Protocols Supported TLV (TLV #129).

5. Bridged LAN Link Costs

   RBridges using IS-IS to support TRILL may be interconnected by direct
   links, such as 802.3, or by bridged LANs.  If there an intervening
   bridge or bridges, the link is really multiple bridged links.
   RBridges can automatically detect this condition under some
   circumstances.

   For certain loop avoidance purposes RBridges listen for BPDUs and
   keep track of the most recent announced root bridge on a link
   [RBRIDGE], if any.  This bridge, or the fact that no BPDUs have been
   received, is reported in the link state database as described in
   Section 3.2.1 above.  It is still possible for RBridges to be
   connected by a bridged LAN where the bridge ports to which they are
   connected have been configured not to emit BPDUs. On the other hand,
   if either RBridge is seeing BPDUs it is likely that there are one or
   more intervening bridges.

   When a link is a bridged LAN, transit traffic will experience at
   least two bridged links and possibly many more. To account for this,
   RBridges SHOULD assume, for IS-IS routing purpose, that the default
   metric for traversing such a link is 2*C + 1, where C is the Layer 3
   IS-IS default metric (usually autoconfigured from port speed).

   More precise link cost can be asserted by management configuration.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to add six subTLV value under the IS-IS Capabilities TLV
   (#242). They are all specified in Section 3.1 and 3.2.1 above and are
   as follows:

       Name                 Value
       ----                 -----

      Designated VLAN      <tbd3.1a>
      Appointed Forwarders <tbd3.1b>

      TRILL Flags          <tbd3.2.1a>
      Tree Roots           <tbd3.2.1b>
      VLANs                <tbd3.2.1c>
      VLAN Groups          <tbd3.2.1d>

   NOTE: The IANA registry entry for AFI (Address Family) 6 has
   traditionally said "802 (includes all 802 media plus Ethernet
   'canonical format')". This was copied from RFC 1700 but may have been
   dated for some time as there are different size addresses used in
   IEEE 802, at least 48-bit (MAC-48) and 64-bit (MAC-64) addresses.
   While 48-bit addresses are the most common, 64-bit addresses are, for
   example, used in IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee). In this document, AFI 6 is
   assumed to mean MAC-48 address.  It is suggested that the AFI
   registry value 6 entry be changed to "IEEE 802 MAC-48 addresses".
   Should there be a need to use IEEE 802 MAC-64, or some type of IEEE
   802 addresses other than MAC-48 or MAC-64, then a new AFI should be
   allocated for each such type.



7. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.  IS-IS
   security may be used to secure the IS-IS messages discussed here.
   See [RFC3567]. See [RBRIDGE] for TRILL Security Considerations
