rd=  Reporting Domain (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a string containing a DNS domain name.  This value will be
      used by the Verifier to confirm that failed verification reports
      are desired and collect report generation parameters.  A complete
      description and illustration of how this is applied can be found
      in Section 3.3.

sig-rd-tag = %x72.64 *WSP "=" *WSP domain-name

ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; REQUIRED).  A dkim-quoted-
      printable string (see Section 2.11 of [DKIM]) containing the
      local-part of an email address to which a report SHOULD be sent
      when mail fails DKIM verification for one of the reasons
      enumerated below.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain name found in the "rd=" tag of the DKIM-Signature
      header field.  Therefore, an ADMD making use of this specification
      MUST ensure that an email address thus constructed can receive
      reports generated as described in Section 6.  ABNF:

rep-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP "=" *WSP qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is an integer value from 0 to 100 inclusive
      that indicates what percentage of incidents of signature
      authentication failures, selected at random, are to cause reports
      to be generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports
      for more than the requested percentage of incidents.  Report
      generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to
      indicate that there are more reportable incidents than there are
      reports.  ABNF:

rep-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*3DIGIT

rr=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 5.1 for a
      list of valid tags.  ABNF:

rep-rr-type = ( "all" / "s" / "v" / "x" )
rep-rr-tag = %x72 %x6f *WSP "=" *WSP rep-rr-type
                    *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP rep-rr-type )

rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The
      value is a dkim-quoted-printable string that the publishing ADMD
      requests be included in [SMTP] error strings if messages are
      rejected during the delivery SMTP session.  ABNF:

rep-rs-tag = %x72 %x73 *WSP "=" qp-section

ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing the local-part
      of an email address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail
      claiming to be from this domain failed the verification algorithm
      described in [ADSP], in particular because a message arrived
      without a signature that validates, which contradicts what the
      ADSP record claims.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain whose policy was queried in order to evaluate the
      sender's ADSP, i.e., the one taken from the RFC5322.From domain of
      the message under evaluation.  Therefore, a signer making use of
      this extension tag MUST ensure that an email address thus
      constructed can receive reports generated as described in
      Section 6.  ABNF:

adsp-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP "=" qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is a single integer value from 0 to 100
      inclusive that indicates what percentage of incidents of ADSP
      evaluation failures, selected at random, should cause reports to
      be generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for
      more than the requested percentage of incidents.  Report
      generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to
      indicate that there are more reportable incidents than there are
      reports.  ABNF:

adsp-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*3DIGIT

rr=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 5.2 for a
      list of valid tags.  ABNF:

adsp-rr-type = ( "all" / "s" / "u" )
adsp-rr-tag = %x72 %x6f *WSP "=" *WSP adsp-rr-type
                     *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP adsp-rr-type )

rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).
      The value is a string the signing domain requests be included in
      [SMTP] error strings when messages are rejected during a single
      SMTP session.  ABNF:

adsp-rs-tag = %x72 %x73 *WSP "=" qp-section
