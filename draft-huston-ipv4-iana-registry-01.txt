Abstract

   This is a report on an analysis of the IPv4 address registry as
   published by the IANA [IPv4], comparing the contents of that registry
   with IPv4 allocation data published by the Regional Internet
   Registries (RIRs), as well as examining the registry from the
   perspective of consistency of style and content.

1.  Introduction

   This is a report on an analysis of the IPv4 address registry as

   published by the IANA [IPv4], comparing the contents of that registry
   with IPv4 allocation data published by the Regional Internet
   Registries (RIRs), as well as examining the registry from the
   perspective of consistency of style and content.

2.  IANA IPv4 Address Registry Comments

   The areas of note with respect to the consistency and accuracy of the
   IANA IPv4 registry are as follows:

   1.   Registry Completeness

        The registry is incomplete.  There are a number of special
        reservations of addresses listed in RFC3330 [RFC3330] that also
        form part of the IPv4 address status.  It would be appropriate
        to include the entries as listed in RFC 3330 in the IANA IPv4
        registry.  This could take the form of notes relating to entries
        for the blocks "128.0.0.0/8", "169.0.0.0/8", "172.0.0.0/8",
        "192.0.0.0/8", and "198.0.0.0/8", where components of these
        blocks are reserved for particular purposes.

   2.   Interpretation of the annotation "IANA - Reserved"

        A number of registry entries are listed with the purpose of
        "IANA - Reserved".  Some of these address blocks are reserved by
        Internet Standards actions for particular purposes, while other
        are held by IANA to be subsequently assigned for general use.
        The registry should note that if a block is reserved by an
        Internet Standard for a particular purpose, then the registry
        entry should reflect this particular status.  This comment
        relating to "special purpose" reservations refers to the entries
        for the address blocks "0.0.0.0/8", "127.0.0.0/8" and
        "240.0.0.0/8" through "255.0.0.0/8".  In other cases it would
        appear that the appropriate status description of the address
        block is "Unallocated".

   3.   Interpretation of registry entry for the "24.0.0.0/8" address
        block

        This IANA registry entry is listed as "ARIN - Cable Block".  In
        the interests of consistency and conformance to current use of
        this address block, the registry description should be "ARIN"
        without any particular purpose qualification.

   4.   Interpretation of Notes

        The note relating to "24.0.0.0/8" indicates that this was
        "Formerly IANA - Jul 95".  It would be reasonable to assume that

Internet-Draft             IANA IPv4 Registry                August 2005


        all address blocks are formerly held by IANA, in which case no
        particular mention of this status with respect to the 24.0.0.0/8
        block is necessary.  The more generic issue here is that there
        is a valid distinction to be drawn between a current registry
        status report and the log of previous changes to the registry.
        It is assumed that the IANA registry file is a description of
        the current status of the registry, in which case a log of
        changes to the registry is better managed as a distinct report
        of the sequence of annotated changes to the registry file,
        rather than attempting to use the notes in this registry to
        achieve that purpose.

   5.   Consistency of Registry Contents

        The address blocks for "173.0.0.0/8 through "187.0.0.0/8" have
        dates of April 2003.  It is assumed from the dates that these
        address blocks were formerly allocated.  This raises the
        question of consistency of registry information, in that there
        no notes associated with these blocks whereas other formerly
        allocated blocks are explicitly identified.  Again the use of a
        distinct log of changes to the registry would allow for a more
        consistent method to capture this data.

   6.   Consistency of References

        The note entry for "0.0.0.0/8" should refer to RFC3330.

        The note entry for "014/8" should refer to RFC 1700.

        The note entries for "224.0.0.0/8" through to "239.0.0.0/8"
        should refer to RFC3171.

        The note entries for "240.0.0.0/8" through to "255.0.0.0/8"
        should refer to RFC1700.

   7.   Ambiguities

        The entries for "049.0.0.0/8" and "50.0.0.0/8" indicate a
        purpose of "Joint Technical Command", with a registry date of
        May 1994, yet the associated note indicates "Returned to IANA
        Mar 98".  It would be reasonable to interpret the current status
        of these two address blocks as part of the unallocated global
        unicast address pool.  In this case a consistent registry entry
        for these address blocks would read:

             049/8 Mar 98 Unallocated
             050/8 Mar 98 Unallocated

Internet-Draft             IANA IPv4 Registry                August 2005


   8.   A reference to a previous allocation to the Joint Technical
        Command, and the subsequent return to IANA of these address
        blocks would be more appropriately recorded in a log of changes
        to the registry.
   9.   RFC 3330 Interpretation

        The complete IPv4 number status relies on a consistent
        interpretation of RFC3330.  Entries for 39.0.0.0/8,
        128.0.0.0/16, 191.0.0.0/16, 192.0.0.0/24, and 223.255.255.0/24
        claim that the "present use" is "Reserved but subject to
        allocation".  Does this imply that these address blocks are
        reserved, or form part of the general global unicast pool of as-
        yet-unallocated address blocks?  The assumption used here is
        that these blocks are presently subject to allocation in the
        same manner as any other currently unallocated address block.

   10.  Maintenance of Assignment information

        It is noted that the Digital Equipment Corporation no longer
        exists.  This raises the broader question of the currency of the
        information associated with this registry, and whether the
        listed entities which received address blocks from IANA are
        still those entities as listed.

   11.  Accuracy of the Date Field in the registry

        The date field for "223.0.0.0/8" is April 2003.  If this block
        has not been formally allocated at any time, then what is the
        reason for this relatively recent date?

   12.  Inconsistencies in the Date field compared to RIR data

        The date fields associated with many of these entries are
        inconsistent with records held by the RIRs.  The primary source
        of the dates proposed here is the database of address
        allocations as maintained by ARIN [ARIN Stats].  Namely:

   13.  Inconsistency with other address allocation data sources

        The ARIN Registry lists the address block "7.0.0.0/8" as
        assigned to the US Department of Defence.  IANA records this
        block as "IANA - Reserved", with the implication that this block
        is part of the current unallocated pool.

        The ARIN registry maintains a copy of all IANA allocations, with
        the exception of the allocation of 46.0.0.0/8, which IANA lists
        as an allocation to Bolt, Beranek and Newman, and ARIN maintains
        no allocation information for this address block.  This raises
        the question of how these discrepancies arose, and the follow up
        question of which source is authoritative for current address
        status.

   14.  Reference Consistency

        The IANA IPv4 registry lists as references RFC1466, RFC1700,
        RFC1918 and RFC3330.  RFC1466 has been obsoleted by RFC2050.
        The references should also include RFC3171.  The Public Data
        registry associated with the entry "14.0.0.0/8" is defined in
        RFC1356.

3.  Amended IANA IPv4 Registry

   The following is an example of a registry format and content that
   attempts to resolve these inconsistencies.  Where RFC 3330 has
   described address blocks as "Reserved, but subject to allocation",
   this example registry assumes that such blocks are currently
   unallocated in the same fashion as any other unallocated address
   block.  The dates of allocation actions reflect the RIR recorded
   dates as noted above.  Unallocated address blocks have no allocation
   date.  The reference to notes has been treated consistently, as per
   the notes.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security of the Internet's routing system relies on the ability to
   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address block.
   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that the
   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and
   that there is a trustable reference from the IANA address registry to
   the references Regional Internet Registry (RIR), and a trustable
   reference from the RIR's registry to a Local Internet Registry or end
   user Internet Service Provider.

   The proposed format for the IANA registry is a small step towards the
   creation of a registry that can be used as a trust point for
   commencing a chain of address validation.  Consideration should be
   given to IANA registry publication formats that are machine
   parseable, and also the use of file signatures and associated
   certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm that the
   registry contents are current, and that they have been published by
   the IANA.
