     2.  Abstract

     This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS account-
     ing client functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Man-
     agement  Information Base (MIB) for use with network management proto-
     cols in the Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based  man-
     agement stations can manage RADIUS accounting clients.


     3.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     accounting clients.

     Today a wide range of network devices, including  routers  and  NASes,
     act  as  RADIUS accounting clients in order to provide accounting ser-
     vices. As a result, the  effective  management  of  RADIUS  accounting
     clients is of considerable importance.

     4.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The  SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major compo-
     nents.  They are:

           o  RFC 1902 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
              describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

           o  RFC 1905 which defines the protocol used for network access to
              managed objects.

           o  RFC 1907 defines the core set of managed objects for the
              Internet suite of protocols.

           o  RFC 1909 which defines the administrative aspects of the
              framework.

     The Framework permits new objects to be defined  for  the  purpose  of
     experimentation and evaluation.


     4.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base  or  MIB.   Objects  in  the  MIB  are
     defined  using  the  subset  of  Abstract  Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
     defined in the SMI. In particular, each object object type is named by
     an  OBJECT  IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
     type together with an object instance serves to  uniquely  identify  a
     specific  instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer  to  the  object
     type.


     5.  Overview

     The  RADIUS  accounting  protocol,  described  in  [2],  distinguishes
     between the  client  function  and  the  server  function.  In  RADIUS
     accounting,  clients  send Accounting-Requests, and servers reply with
     Accounting-Responses. Typically NAS devices implement the client func-
     tion,  and  thus  would be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting
     client MIB, while RADIUS accounting servers implement the server func-
     tion,  and  thus  would be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting
     server MIB.

     However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to perform both
     client  and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a
     server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while  simultaneously
     acting  as  an accounting client to one or more accounting servers. In
     such situations, it is expected that RADIUS entities combining  client
     and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.

     5.1.  Selected objects
     This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Accounting Server Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS server that the client shares a secret with.

     Each entry in the  RADIUS  Accounting  Server  Table  includes  eleven
     entries presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS client.
