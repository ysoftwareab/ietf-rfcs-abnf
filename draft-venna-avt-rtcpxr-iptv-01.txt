 Abstract 
     
    This document defines a new report block for the Extended Report 
    (XR) packet type of the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) for use by IPTV 
    applications. The report block supports monitoring of IPTV streams 
    by providing a mechanism for IPTV clients to report on the 
    performance of different aspects of the IPTV stream.

 1. Introduction 
  
  
    As the number of IPTV deployments continue to increase, it becomes 
    necessary for the operator to collect various metrics on the 
    streams that are being delivered to understand the quality of the 
    service that a user is receiving. This draft defines a new report 
    block for the Extended Report (XR) packet type of the RTP Control 
    Protocol (RTCP) that allows IPTV clients to report to a server on 
    various aspects of the stream that is being delivered to them.  
     
    [RFC3611] defines the XR packet type for RTCP as well as how XR 
    packets can be signaled by an application that uses Session 
    Description Protocol (SDP). The document further defines seven 
    report block formats to convey information beyond that already 
    contained in the reception report blocks of RTCP's Sender Report 
    (SR) or Receiver Report (RR) packets.  
     
    The new block type defined in this draft is the IPTV Metrics block. 
    The data reported by a client is intended to be useful in 
    understanding the short-term performance of the IPTV service as 
    well as long-term indicators for network configuration.

 2. Terminology 
  
  
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
     
     
 3. Background 
     
     
    [RFC2250] specifies the RTP payload format for MPEG1/MPEG2 Video. 
    The specification describes how to encapsulate MPEG System and 
    Transport streams within the RTP payload. For MPEG2 transport 
    streams, the RTP payload will contain an integral number of MPEG2 
    transport packets. Futher, a small number of these transport 
    packets (normally fixed in size at 188 bytes) are aggregated into a 
    single RTP packet. The number of transport packets contained is 
    computed by dividing the RTP payload length by the length of a 
    transport packet. 
     
    ISO/IEC 13818-1 addresses the combining of one or more elementary 
    streams of video and audio, as well as other data, into single or 
    multiple streams eligible for transmission. MPEG-2 Transport stream 
    packets are made of packets from various elementary streams (audio, 
    video, data) and Program Specific Information (PSI) tables. The 
    four PSI tables viz. Program Association Table (PAT), Program Map 
    Table (PMT), Conditional Access Table (CAT), and Network 
    Information Table (NIT) contain the necessary and sufficient 
    information to demultiplex and present programs. The audio and 
    video elementary streams can carry data encoded using various 
    codecs such as MPEG-1 Audio, MPEG-2 Video, H.264 etc. 
     
    The new reporting blocks defined in this draft report metrics from 
    various encapsulations and views of the media stream - RTP, MPEG-2 
    TS, Programs, Elementary Streams. 
     
    An IPTV client SHOULD use report blocks specified in [RFC3611] and 
    [RFC3550] to report some of the metrics that are relevant to 
    understanding the performance of the media stream. For instance, 
    the client SHOULD use RTCP Reception Report (RR) to report on the 
    cumulative number of packets lost, interarrival jitter etc. The 
    client SHOULD also use the Statistics Summary Report Block of the 
    RTCP Extended Reports to report detailed metrics about lost and 
    duplicate packets, min/max/avg/standard deviation of jitter for a 
    range of sequence numbers.
