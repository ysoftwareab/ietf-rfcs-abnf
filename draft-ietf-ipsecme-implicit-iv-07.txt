Implicit IV for Counter-based Ciphers in Encapsulating Security Payload
                                 (ESP)
                   draft-ietf-ipsecme-implicit-iv-07

Abstract

   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector
   (IV) or nonce in each packet.  The size of IV depends on the applied
   transform, being usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined by
   the time this document is written.  Some algorithms such as AES-GCM,
   AES-CCM, AES-CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305 require a unique nonce but do
   not require an unpredictable nonce.  When using such algorithms the
   packet counter value can be used to generate a nonce.  This avoids
   sending the nonce itself, and saves in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM,
   AES-CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305 8 octets per packet.  This document
   describes how to do this.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Counter-based AES modes of operation such as AES-CTR ([RFC3686]),
   AES-CCM ([RFC4309]), and AES-GCM ([RFC4106]) require the
   specification of an nonce for each ESP packet.  The same applies for
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 ([RFC7634]).  Currently this nonce is sent in each
   ESP packet ([RFC4303]).  This practice is designated in this document
   as "explicit nonce".

   In some context, such as IoT, it may be preferable to avoid carrying
   the extra bytes associated to the IV and instead generate it locally
   on each peer.  The local generation of the nonce is designated in
   this document as "implicit IV".

   The size of this nonce depends on the specific algorithm, but all of
   the algorithms mentioned above take an 8-octet nonce.

Internet-Draft             Implicit IV in ESP                 April 2019


   This document defines how to compute the nonce locally when it is
   implicit.  It also specifies how peers agree with the Internet Key
   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2 - [RFC7296]) on using an implicit IV versus
   an explicit IV.

   This document limits its scope to the algorithms mentioned above.
   Other algorithms with similar properties may later be defined to use
   this extension.

   This document does not consider AES-CBC ([RFC3602]) as AES-CBC
   requires the IV to be unpredictable.  Deriving it directly from the
   packet counter as described below is insecure as mentioned in
   Security Consideration of [RFC3602] and has led to real world chosen
   plain-text attack such as BEAST [BEAST].

3.  Terminology

   o  IoT: Internet of Things.

   o  IV: Initialization Vector.

   o  IIV: Implicit Initialization Vector.

   o  Nonce: a fixed-size octet string used only once.  This is similar
      to IV, except that in common usage there is no implication of non-
      predictability.

4.  Implicit IV

   With the algorithms listed in Section 2, the 8 byte nonce MUST NOT
   repeat.  The binding between a ESP packet and its nonce is provided
   using the Sequence Number or the Extended Sequence Number.  Figure 1
   and Figure 2 represent the IV with a regular 4-byte Sequence Number
   and with an 8-byte Extended Sequence Number respectively.

   This document solely defines the IV generation of the algorithms
   defined in [RFC4106] for AES-GCM, [RFC4309] for AES-CCM and [RFC7634]
   for ChaCha20-Poly1305.  Any other aspect (including using the Key
   Length attribute) of applying those ciphers with the new Transform
   Types defined in this document MUST be taken from the documents
   defining the use of the algorithms in ESP.

5.  Initiator Behavior

   An initiator supporting this feature SHOULD propose implicit IV
   algorithms in the Transform Type 1 (Encryption Algorithm)
   Substructure of the Proposal Substructure inside the SA Payload.  To
   facilitate backward compatibility with non-supporting peers the
   initiator SHOULD also include those same algorithms without Implicit
   IV (IIV) as separate transforms.

6.  Responder Behavior

   The rules of SA Payload processing require that responder picks its
   algorithms from the proposal sent by the initiator, thus this will
   ensure that the responder will never send an SA payload containing
   the IIV transform to an initiator that did not propose it.

7.  Security Consideration

   Nonce generation for these algorithms has not been explicitly
   defined.  It has been left to the implementation as long as certain
   security requirements are met.  Typically, for AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-
   CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the IV is not allowed being repeated for
   one particular key.  This document provides an explicit and normative
   way to generate IVs.  The mechanism described in this document meets
   the IV security requirements of all relevant algorithms.

Internet-Draft             Implicit IV in ESP                 April 2019


   As the IV must not repeat for one SA when Counter-Mode ciphers are
   used, Implicit IV as described in this document MUST NOT be used in
   setups with the chance that the Sequence Number overlaps for one SA.
   Multicast as described in [RFC5374], [RFC6407] and
   [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] is a prominent example, where many senders share
   one secret and thus one SA.  As such, Implicit IV may only be used
   with Multicast if some mechanisms are employed that prevent Sequence
   Number to overlap for one SA, otherwise Implicit IV MUST NOT be used
   with Multicast.

   This document defines three new encryption transforms that use
   implicit IV.  Unlike most encryption transforms defined to date,
   which can be used for both ESP and IKEv2, these transforms are
   defined for ESP only and cannot be used in IKEv2.  The reason is that
   IKEv2 messages don't contain unique per-message value, that can be
   used for IV generation.  The Message-ID field in IKEv2 header is
   somewhat counterpart of SN field in ESP header, but recent IKEv2
   extensions ([RFC6311], [RFC7383]) do allow it to repeat, so there is
   no an easy way to derive unique IV from IKEv2 header fields.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This section assigns new code points to the recommended AEAD suites
   provided in [RFC8221], thus the new Transform Type 1 - Encryption
   Algorithm Transform IDs [IANA] are as defined below:

   -  ENCR_AES_CCM_8_IIV: 29

   -  ENCR_AES_GCM_16_IIV: 30

   -  ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305_IIV: 31

   These algorithms should be added with this document as ESP Reference
   and "Not Allowed" for IKEv2 Reference.

9.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thanks people Valery Smyslov for their valuable
   comments, David Schinazi for its implementation, as well as the
   ipseceme chairs Tero Kivinen and David Waltermire for moving this
   work forward.
