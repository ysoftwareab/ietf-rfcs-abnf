Abstract

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type [MIME-DIR] for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card. The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol. The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.). The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The profile
   also provides the method for including a [VCARD] representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the [MIME-DIR] document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST  NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL  NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interopreted as described in [RFC-2119].

1. Overview

   The [MIME-DIR] document defines a MIME Content-Type for holding
   different kinds of directory information. The directory information
   may be based on any of a number of directory schemas. This document
   defines a [MIME-DIR] usage profile for conveying directory



Dawson & Howes                  [Page 1]                       May 1998


                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   information based on one such schema; that of the white-pages type of
   person object.

   The schema is based on the attributes for the person object defined
   in the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The schema
   has augmented the basic attributes defined in the X.500 series
   recommendation in order to provide for an electronic representation
   of the information commonly found on a paper business card. This
   schema was first defined in the [VCARD] document. Hence, this [MIME-
   DIR] profile is referred to as the vCard MIME Directory Profile.

   A directory entry based on this usage profile can include traditional
   directory, white-pages information such as the distinguished name
   used to uniquely identify the entry, a formatted representation of
   the name used for user-interface or presentation purposes, both the
   structured and presentation form of the delivery address, various
   telephone numbers and organizational information associated with the
   entry. In addition, traditional paper business card information such
   as an image of an organizational logo or identify photograph can be
   included in this person object.

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile also provides support for
   representing other important information about the person associated
   with the directory entry. For instance, the date of birth of the
   person; an audio clip describing the pronunciation of the name
   associated with the directory entry, or some other application of the
   digital sound; longitude and latitude geo-positioning information
   related to the person associated with the directory entry; date and
   time that the directory information was last updated; annotations
   often written on a business card; Uniform Resource Locators (URL) for
   a website; public key information. The profile also provides support
   for non-standard extensions to the schema. This provides the
   flexibility for implementations to augment the current capabilities
   of the profile in a standardized way. More information about this
   electronic business card format can be found in [VCARD].

2. The vCard Mime Directory Profile Registration

   This profile is identified by the following [MIME-DIR] registration
   template information. Subsequent sections define the profile
   definition.

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME profile VCARD

   Profile name: VCARD

   Profile purpose: To hold person object or white-pages type of
   directory information. The person schema captured in the directory
   entries is that commonly found in an electronic business card.

   Predefined MIME Directory types used: SOURCE, NAME, PROFILE, BEGIN,
   END, PROFILE.

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   Predefined MIME Directory parameters used: ENCODING, VALUE, CHARSET,
   LANGUAGE, CONTEXT.

   New types: FN, N, NICKNAME, PHOTO, BDAY, ADR, LABEL, TEL, EMAIL,
   MAILER, TZ, GEO, TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, AGENT, ORG, CATEGORIES, NOTE,
   PRODID, REV, SORT-STRING, SOUND, URL, UID, VERSION, CLASS, KEY

   New parameters: TYPE

   Profile special notes: The type-grouping feature of [MIME-DIR] is
   supported by this profile to group related vCard properties about a
   directory entry. For example, vCard properties describing WORK or
   HOME related characteristics MAY be grouped with a unique group
   label.

   The profile permits the use of non-standard types (i.e., those
   identified with the prefix string "X-") as a flexible method for
   implementations to extend the functionality currently defined within
   this profile.

3. MIME Directory Features

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile makes use of many of the features
   defined by [MIME-DIR]. The following sections either clarify or
   extend the content-type definition of [MIME-DIR].

3.1 Predefined Type Usage

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile uses the following predefined types
   from [MIME-DIR].

3.1.1 BEGIN and END Type

   The content entity MUST begin with the BEGIN type with a value of
   "VCARD". The content entity MUST end with the END type with a value
   of "VCARD".

3.1.2 NAME Type

   If the NAME type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value is the displayable, presentation text associated
   with the source for the vCard, as specified in the SOURCE type.

3.1.3 PROFILE Type

   If the PROFILE type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value must be "VCARD".

3.1.4 SOURCE Type

   If the SOURCE type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value provides information how to find the source for
   the vCard.

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


3.2 Predefined Type Parameter Usage

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile uses the following predefined types
   parameters as defined by [MIME-DIR].

        . LANGUAGE

        . ENCODING

        . VALUE

3.3 Predefined VALUE Type Usage

   The predefined data type values specified in [MIME-DIR] MAY NOT be
   repeated in COMMA separated value lists, unless specified by this
   specification.

3.4 Extensions To The Predefined VALUE Types

   The predefined data type values specified in [MIME-DIR] have been
   extended by the vCard profile to include a number of value types that
   are specific to this profile.

3.4.1 BINARY

   The "binary" value type specifies that the type value is inline,
   encoded binary data. This value type may be specified in the PHOTO,
   LOGO, SOUND, and KEY types.

   If inline encoded binary data is specified, the ENCODING type
   parameter must be used to specify the encoding format. The binary
   data MUST be encoded using the "B" encoding format. Long lines of
   encoded binary data may be folded using the folding method defined in
   [MIME-DIR].

   The value type is defined by the following notation:

   binary = <A "B" binary encoded string as defined by [RFC 2047].>

3.4.2 VCARD

   The "vcard" value type specifies that the type value is another
   vCard. This value type may be specified in the AGENT type. The value
   type is defined by this specification. Since each of the type
   declarations with in the vcard value type are being specified within
   a type value themselves, they MUST be terminated with the backslash
   escapement sequence "\n" or "\N", instead of the character sequence
   CRLF. For example, with the AGENT type a value would be specified as:

        AGENT:BEGIN:VCARD\nFN:Joe Friday\nTEL:+1-919-555-7878\n
         TITLE:Area Administrator\, Assistant\n
         EMAIL;INTERNET:jfriday@host.com\n
         END:VCARD

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


3.4.3 PHONE-NUMBER

   The "phone-number" value type specifies that the type value is a
   telephone number. This value type may be specified in the TEL type.
   The value type is a text value that has the special semantics of a
   telephone number as defined in [CCITT E.163] and [CCITT X.121].

3.4.4 UTC-OFFSET

   The "utc-offset" value type specifies that the type value is a signed
   offset from UTC. This value type may be specified in the TZ type.

   The value type is an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It
   is specified as a positive or negative difference in units of hours
   and minutes (e.g., +hh:mm). The time is specified as a 24-hour clock.
   Hour values are from 00 to 23, and minute values are from 00 to 59.
   Hour and minutes are 2-digits with high order zeroes required to
   maintain digit count. The extended format for ISO 8601 UTC offsets
   MUST be used. The extended format makes use of a colon character as a
   separator of the hour and minute text fields.

   The value is defined by the following notation:

        time-hour       = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
        time-minute     = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
        utc-offset      = ("+" / "-") time-hour ":" time-minute

3.5 Structured Type Values

   Compound type values are delimited by a field delimiter, specified by
   the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMI-COLON in a
   component of a compound property value must be escaped with a
   BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Lists of values are delimited by a list delimiter, specified by the
   COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). A COMMA character in a value must
   be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   This profile supports the type grouping mechanism defined in [MIME-
   DIR]. Grouping of related types is a useful technique to communicate
   common semantics concerning the properties of a vCard.

3.6 Line Delimiting and Folding

   This profile supports the same line delimiting and folding methods
   defined in [MIME-DIR].

4. vCard Profile Features

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile Type contains directory information,
   typically pertaining to a single directory entry. The information is
   described using an attribute schema that is tailored for capturing
   personal contact information. The vCard can include attributes that
   describe identification, delivery addressing, telecommunications

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   Type name: ADR

   Type purpose: To specify the structured components of the delivery
   address for the vCard object.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single structured text value, separated by the SEMI-
   COLON character (ASCII decimal 59) and optionally one or more LWSP.

   Type special notes: The structured text value consists of a sequence
   of address components. The component values MUST be specified in
   their corresponding position. The structured text value corresponds,
   in sequence, to the post office box; the extended address; the street
   address; the locality (e.g., city); the region (e.g., state or
   province); the postal code; the country name. When a component value
   is missing, the associated component separator must still be
   specified.

   The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to specify the
   delivery address type. The TYPE parameter values may include "dom" to
   indicate a domestic delivery address; "intl" to indicate an
   international delivery address; "postal" to indicate a postal
   delivery address; "parcel" to indicate a parcel delivery address;
   "home" to indicate a delivery address for a residence; "work" to
   indicate delivery address for a place of work; and "pref" to indicate
   the preferred delivery address when more than one address is
   specified. These type parameter values may be specified as a
   parameter list (i.e., "TYPE=dom;TYPE=postal") or as a value list
   (i.e., "TYPE=dom,postal"). This type is based on semantics of the
   X.520 geographical and postal addressing attributes. The default is
   "TYPE=intl,postal,parcel,work". The default can be overridden to some
   other set of values by specifying one or more alternate values. For
   example, the default can be reset to "TYPE=dom,postal,work,home" to
   specify a domestic delivery address for postal delivery to a
   residence that is also used for work.

   Type example: In this example the post office box and the extended
   address are absent.

          ADR;TYPE=dom,home,postal,parcel:;;123 Main

   Type special notes: The type value is formatted text that may be used
   to present a delivery address label for the vCard object. The type
   may include the type parameter "TYPE" to specify delivery label type.
   The TYPE parameter values may include "dom" to indicate a domestic
   delivery label; "intl" to indicate an international delivery label;
   "postal" to indicate a postal delivery label; "parcel" to indicate a
   parcel delivery label; "home" to indicate a delivery label for a
   residence; "work" to indicate delivery label for a place of work; and
   "pref" to indicate the preferred delivery label when more than one
   label is specified. These type parameter values may specified as a
   parameter list (i.e., "TYPE=dom;TYPE=postal") or as a value list
   (i.e., "TYPE=dom,postal"). This type is based on semantics of the
   X.520 geographical and postal addressing attributes. The default is
   "TYPE=intl,postal,parcel,work". The default can be overridden to some
   other set of values by specifying one or more alternate values. For
   example, the default can be reset to "TYPE=intl,post,parcel,home" to
   specify an international delivery label for both postal and parcel
   delivery to a residencial location.

4.4.2 GEO Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type GEO

   Type name: GEO

   Type purpose: To specify information related to the global
   positioning of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit.

   Type value: Two float values separated by the SEMI-COLON character
   (ASCII decimal 59).

   Type special notes: This type specifies information related to the
   global position of the object associated with the vCard. The value
   specifies latitude and longitude, in that order (i.e., "LAT LON"
   ordering). The longitude represents the location east and west of the
   prime meridian as a positive or negative real number, respectively.
   The latitude represents the location north and south of the equator
   as a positive or negative real number, respectively. The longitude
   and latitude values must be specified as decimal degrees and should
   be specified to six decimal places. This will allow for granularity
   within a meter of the geographical position. The text components are
   separated by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). The simple
   formula for converting degrees-minutes-seconds into decimal degrees
   is:

        decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

   Type example:

        GEO:37.386013;-122.082932

4.5 Organizational Types

   These types are concerned with information associated with
   characteristics of the organization or organizational units of the

   Type purpose: To specify information concerning the role, occupation,
   or business category of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single text value.

   Type special notes: This type is based on the X.520 Business Category
   explanatory attribute. This property is included as an organizational
   type to avoid confusion with the semantics of the TITLE type and
   incorrect usage of that type when the semantics of this type is
   intended.

   value is referenced by a URI value, then the default encoding of 8bit
   is used and no explicit ENCODING parameter is needed.

   Type value: A single value. The default is binary. It may also be
   reset to uri. The uri value may be used to specify a value outside of
   this MIME entity.

   Type special notes: The type MAY include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify the graphic image format type. The TYPE parameter values MUST
   be one of the IANA registered image formats or a non-standard image
   format.

   Type example:

   information outside of this MIME entity.

   Type special notes: This type typically is used to specify an area
   administrator, assistant, or secretary for the individual associated
   with the vCard. A key characteristic of the Agent type is that it
   represents somebody or something that is separately addressable.

   Type example:

        AGENT;VALUE=uri:
         CID:JQPUBLIC.part3.960129T083020.xyzMail@host3.com

4.6.5 SORT-STRING Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type SORT-STRING

   Type Name: SORT-STRING

   Type purpose: To specify the text to be used in national language
   specific sorting of the values specified by the FN or N types.

   Type encoding: The default is 8bit. May also be reset to 7bit or

   Type value: text

   Type special notes: The sort string is used to provide text  that is
   to be used in locale- or national language-specific sorting of the
   values for the formatted name or structured name types. Without this
   information, sorting algorithms may incorrectly sort this vCard
   within a sequence of sorted vCards. If this type is present in a
   vCard, then this value should be used for sorting the vCard, instead
   of the values of the FN or N types.

   Type example: The following would define the sort string "Harten" for
   the "FN:Rene J. van der Harten" or "N:van der
   Harten;Rene;J.;Sir;R.D.O.N.".

4.8 Extended Types

   The types defined by this document can be extended with private types
   using the non-standard, private values mechanism defined in [RFC-
   2045]. Non-standard, private types with a name starting with "X-" may
   be defined bilaterally between two cooperating agents without outside
   registration or standardization.

5. Differences With vCard v2.1

   This specification has been reviewed by the IETF community. The
   review process introduced a number of differences with the [VCARD]
   version 2.1. These differences are minor, but require that vCard
   objects conforming to this specification have a different version
   number than a vCard conforming to [VCARD]. The differences include
   the following:

        . The QUOTED-PRINTABLE inline encoding has been eliminated.
          Only the "B" encoding of [RFC 2047] is an allowed value for
          the ENCODING parameter.

        . The method for specifying CRLF character sequences in type
          values has been changed. The CRLF character sequence in a
          type value is specified with the backslash character sequence
          "\n" or "\N".

        . Any COMMA or SEMICOLON in a type value must be backslash
          escaped.

        . VERSION value corresponding to this specification must be
          "3.0".

        . The [MIME-DIR] predefined types of SOURCE, NAME and PROFILE
          are allowed.

        . The [MIME-DIR] VALUE type parameter for value data typing is
          allowed. In addition, there are extensions made to these type
          values for additional value types used in this specification.

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


        . The [VCARD] CHARSET type parameter has been eliminated.
          Character set may only be specified on the CHARSET parameter
          on the Content-Type MIME header field.

        . The [VCARD] support for non-signficant LWSP character, other
          than after the COMMA character list separator, SEMICOLON
          character value component separator and the COLON value
          separator has been eliminated.

        . LOGO, PHOTO and SOUND multimedia formats need to be either
          IANA registered types or non-standard types.

        . Inline binary content must be "B" encoded and folded. A blank
          line after the encoded binary content is nolonger required.

        . TEL values may be identified as personal communication
          services telephone numbers with the PCS type parameter value.

        . The CATEGORIES, CLASS, NICKNAME, PRODID and SORT-STRING types
          have been added.

6. Formal Grammar

   The following formal grammar is provided to assist developers in
   building parsers for the vCard.

   This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC 822,
   but it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:

   CR           = <ASCII CR, carriage return>  ; (15, 13.)
   LF           = <ASCII LF, linefeed>         ; (12,10.)
   CRLF         = CR LF
   SPACE        = <ASCII SP, space>            ; (40,32.)
   HTAB         =<ASCII HT, horizontal-tab>    ; (11,9.)
   WS           = (SPACE / HTAB)

   All literal property names are valid as upper, lower, or mixed case.

   char         = <any printable character from the current
                  character set >

   word         = 1*char

   group        = word "."

   vcard_entity = 1*(vcard)

   vcard        = [group] "BEGIN" ":" [WS] "VCARD" 1*CRLF
                  1*([group] item *CRLF
                  [group] "END" ":" [WS] "VCARD" 1*CRLF
        ;All lines may be "folded".
