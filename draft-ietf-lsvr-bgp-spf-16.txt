            BGP Link-State Shortest Path First (SPF) Routing
                       draft-ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf-16

Abstract

   Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on
   simplified layer 3 routing.  Furthermore, requirements for
   operational simplicity have led many of these MSDCs to converge on
   BGP as their single routing protocol for both their fabric routing
   and their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing.  This document
   describes extensions to BGP to use BGP Link-State distribution and
   the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm used by Internal Gateway
   Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF.  In doing this, it allows BGP to be
   efficiently used as both the underlay protocol and the overlay
   protocol in MSDCs.

1.  Introduction

   Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on
   simplified layer 3 routing.  Furthermore, requirements for
   operational simplicity have led many of these MSDCs to converge on
   BGP [RFC4271] as their single routing protocol for both their fabric
   routing and their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing [RFC7938].
   This document describes an alternative solution which leverages BGP-
   LS [RFC7752] and the Shortest Path First algorithm used by Internal
   Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF [RFC2328].

   This document leverages both the BGP protocol [RFC4271] and the BGP-
   LS [RFC7752] protocols.  The relationship, as well as the scope of
   changes are described respectively in Section 2 and Section 3.  The
   modifications to [RFC4271] for BGP SPF described herein only apply to
   IPv4 and IPv6 as underlay unicast Subsequent Address Families
   Identifiers (SAFIs).  Operations for any other BGP SAFIs are outside
   the scope of this document.

   This solution avails the benefits of both BGP and SPF-based IGPs.
   These include TCP based flow-control, no periodic link-state refresh,
   and completely incremental NLRI advertisement.  These advantages can
   reduce the overhead in MSDCs where there is a high degree of Equal
   Cost Multi-Path (ECMPs) and the topology is very stable.
   Additionally, using an SPF-based computation can support fast
   convergence and the computation of Loop-Free Alternatives (LFAs).
   The SPF LFA extensions defined in [RFC5286] can be similarly applied
   to BGP SPF calculations.  However, the details are a matter of

   implementation detail.  Furthermore, a BGP-based solution lends
   itself to multiple peering models including those incorporating
   route-reflectors [RFC4456] or controllers.

1.1.  Terminology

   This specification reuses terms defined in section 1.1 of [RFC4271]
   including BGP speaker, NLRI, and Route.

   Additionally, this document introduces the following terms:

   BGP SPF Routing Domain:  A set of BGP routers that are under a single
      administrative domain and exchange link-state information using
      the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI and compute routes using BGP SPF as described
      herein.

   BGP-LS-SPF NLRI:  This refers to BGP-LS Network Layer Reachability
      Information (NLRI) that is being advertised in the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI
      (Section 5.1) and is being used for BGP SPF route computation.

   Dijkstra Algorithm:  An algorithm for computing the shortest path
      from a given node in a graph to every other node in the graph.  At
      each iteration of the algorithm, there is a list of candidate
      vertices.  Paths from the root to these vertices have been found,
      but not necessarily the shortest ones.  However, the paths to the
      candidate vertex that is closest to the root are guaranteed to be
      shortest; this vertex is added to the shortest-path tree, removed
      from the candidate list, and its adjacent vertices are examined
      for possible addition to/modification of the candidate list.  The
      algorithm then iterates again.  It terminates when the candidate
      list becomes empty.  [RFC2328]

1.2.  BGP Shortest Path First (SPF) Motivation

   Given that [RFC7938] already describes how BGP could be used as the
   sole routing protocol in an MSDC, one might question the motivation
   for defining an alternate BGP deployment model when a mature solution
   exists.  For both alternatives, BGP offers the operational benefits
   of a single routing protocol as opposed to the combination of an IGP
   for the underlay and BGP as an overlay.  However, BGP SPF offers some
   unique advantages above and beyond standard BGP distance-vector
   routing.  With BGP SPF, the standard hop-by-hop peering model is
   relaxed.

   A primary advantage is that all BGP SPF speakers in the BGP SPF
   routing domain will have a complete view of the topology.  This will
   allow support for ECMP, IP fast-reroute (e.g., Loop-Free
   Alternatives), Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), and other routing

   enhancements without advertisement of additional BGP paths [RFC7911]
   or other extensions.  In short, the advantages of an IGP such as OSPF
   [RFC2328] are availed in BGP.

   With the simplified BGP decision process as defined in Section 6,
   NLRI changes can be disseminated throughout the BGP routing domain
   much more rapidly (equivalent to IGPs with the proper
   implementation).  The added advantage of BGP using TCP for reliable
   transport leverages TCP's inherent flow-control and guaranteed in-
   order delivery.

   Another primary advantage is a potential reduction in NLRI
   advertisement.  With standard BGP distance-vector routing, a single
   link failure may impact 100s or 1000s prefixes and result in the
   withdrawal or re-advertisement of the attendant NLRI.  With BGP SPF,
   only the BGP SPF speakers corresponding to the link NLRI need to
   withdraw the corresponding BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI.  Additionally, the
   changed NLRI will be advertised immediately as opposed to normal BGP
   where it is only advertised after the best route selection.  These
   advantages will afford NLRI dissemination throughout the BGP SPF
   routing domain with efficiencies similar to link-state protocols.

   With controller and route-reflector peering models, BGP SPF
   advertisement and distributed computation require a minimal number of
   sessions and copies of the NLRI since only the latest version of the
   NLRI from the originator is required.  Given that verification of the
   adjacencies is done outside of BGP (see Section 4), each BGP SPF
   speaker will only need as many sessions and copies of the NLRI as
   required for redundancy (see Section 4).  Additionally, a controller
   could inject topology that is learned outside the BGP SPF routing
   domain.

   Given that controllers are already consuming BGP-LS NLRI [RFC7752],
   this functionality can be reused for BGP-LS-SPF NLRI.

   Another advantage of BGP SPF is that both IPv6 and IPv4 can be
   supported using the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI with the same BGP-LS-SPF NLRIs.
   In many MSDC fabrics, the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies are congruent,
   refer to Section 5.2.2 and Section 5.2.3.  Although beyond the scope
   of this document, multi-topology extensions could be used to support
   separate IPv4, IPv6, unicast, and multicast topologies while sharing
   the same NLRI.

   Finally, the BGP SPF topology can be used as an underlay for other
   BGP SAFIs (using the existing model) and realize all the above
   advantages.

1.3.  Document Overview

   The document begins with sections defining the precise relationship
   that BGP SPF has with both the base BGP protocol [RFC4271]
   (Section 2) and the BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions [RFC7752]
   (Section 3).  This is required to dispel the notion that BGP SPF is
   an independent protocol.  The BGP peering models, as well as the
   their respective trade-offs are then discussed in Section 4.  The
   remaining sections, which make up the bulk of the document, define
   the protocol enhancements necessary to support BGP SPF.  The BGP-LS
   extensions to support BGP SPF are defined in Section 5.  The
   replacement of the base BGP decision process with the SPF computation
   is specified in Section 6.  Finally, BGP SPF error handling is
   defined in Section 7

1.4.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Base BGP Protocol Relationship

   With the exception of the decision process, the BGP SPF extensions
   leverage the BGP protocol [RFC4271] without change.  This includes
   the BGP protocol Finite State Machine, BGP messages and their
   encodings, processing of BGP messages, BGP attributes and path
   attributes, BGP NLRI encodings, and any error handling defined in the
   [RFC4271] and [RFC7606].

   Due to the changes to the decision process, there are mechanisms and
   encodings that are no longer applicable.  While not necessarily
   required for computation, the ORIGIN, AS_PATH, MULTI_EXIT_DISC,
   LOCAL_PREF, and NEXT_HOP path attributes are mandatory and will be
   validated.  The ATOMIC_AGGEGATE, and AGGREGATOR are not applicable
   within the context of BGP SPF and SHOULD NOT be advertised.  However,
   if they are advertised, they will be accepted, validated, and
   propagated consistent with the BGP protocol.

   Section 9 of [RFC4271] defines the decision process that is used to
   select routes for subsequent advertisement by applying the policies
   in the local Policy Information Base (PIB) to the routes stored in
   its Adj-RIBs-In.  The output of the Decision Process is the set of
   routes that are announced by a BGP speaker to its peers.  These
   selected routes are stored by a BGP speaker in the speaker's Adj-
   RIBs-Out according to policy.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   The BGP SPF extension fundamentally changes the decision process, as
   described herein, to be more like a link-state protocol (e.g., OSPF
   [RFC2328]).  Specifically:

   1.  BGP advertisements are readvertised to neighbors immediately
       without waiting or dependence on the route computation as
       specified in phase 3 of the base BGP decision process.  Multiple
       peering models are supported as specified in Section 4.

   2.  Determining the degree of preference for BGP routes for the SPF
       calculation as described in phase 1 of the base BGP decision
       process is replaced with the mechanisms in Section 6.1.

   3.  Phase 2 of the base BGP protocol decision process is replaced
       with the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, also known as the
       Dijkstra algorithm Section 1.1.

3.  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) Relationship

   [RFC7752] describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE
   information can be collected from networks and shared with external
   entities using BGP.  This is achieved by defining NLRI advertised
   using the BGP-LS AFI.  The BGP-LS extensions defined in [RFC7752]
   make use of the decision process defined in [RFC4271].  This document
   reuses NLRI and TLVs defined in [RFC7752].  Rather than reusing the
   BGP-LS SAFI, the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI Section 5.1 is introduced to insure
   backward compatibility for the BGP-LS SAFI usage.

   The BGP SPF extensions reuse the Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI defined
   in [RFC7752].  The usage of the BGP-LS NLRI, attributes, and
   attribute extensions is described in Section 5.2.  The usage of
   others BGP-LS attributes is not precluded and is, in fact, expected.
   However, the details are beyond the scope of this document and will
   be specified in future documents.

   Support for Multiple Topology Routing (MTR) similar to the OSPF MTR
   computation described in [RFC4915] is beyond the scope of this
   document.  Consequently, the usage of the Multi-Topology TLV as
   described in section 3.2.1.5 of [RFC7752] is not specified.

   The rules for setting the NLRI next-hop path attribute for the BGP-
   LS-SPF SAFI will follow the BGP-LS SAFI as specified in section 3.4
   of [RFC7752].

4.  BGP Peering Models

   Depending on the topology, scaling, capabilities of the BGP SPF
   speakers, and redundancy requirements, various peering models are
   supported.  The only requirements are that all BGP SPF speakers in
   the BGP SPF routing domain exchange BGP-LS-SPF NLRI, run an SPF
   calculation, and update their routing table appropriately.

4.1.  BGP Single-Hop Peering on Network Node Connections

   The simplest peering model is the one where EBGP single-hop sessions
   are established over direct point-to-point links interconnecting the
   nodes in the BGP SPF routing domain.  Once the single-hop BGP session
   has been established and the BGP-LS-SPF AFI/SAFI capability has been
   exchanged [RFC4760] for the corresponding session, then the link is
   considered up from a BGP SPF perspective and the corresponding BGP-
   LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised.  If the session goes down, the
   corresponding Link NLRI will be withdrawn.  Topologically, this would
   be equivalent to the peering model in [RFC7938] where there is a BGP
   session on every link in the data center switch fabric.  The content
   of the Link NLRI is described in Section 5.2.2.

4.2.  BGP Peering Between Directly-Connected Nodes

   In this model, BGP SPF speakers peer with all directly-connected
   nodes but the sessions may be between loopback addresses (i.e., two-
   hop sessions) and the direct connection discovery and liveliness
   detection for the interconnecting links are independent of the BGP
   protocol.  For example, liveliness detection could be done using the
   BFD protocol [RFC5880].  Precisely how discovery and liveliness
   detection is accomplished is outside the scope of this document.
   Consequently, there will be a single BGP session even if there are
   multiple direct connections between BGP SPF speakers.  BGP-LS-SPF
   Link NLRI is advertised as long as a BGP session has been
   established, the BGP-LS-SPF AFI/SAFI capability has been exchanged
   [RFC4760], and the link is operational as determined using liveliness
   detection mechanisms outside the scope of this document.  This is
   much like the previous peering model only peering is between loopback
   addresses and the interconnecting links can be unnumbered.  However,
   since there are BGP sessions between every directly-connected node in
   the BGP SPF routing domain, there is only a reduction in BGP sessions
   when there are parallel links between nodes.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


4.3.  BGP Peering in Route-Reflector or Controller Topology

   In this model, BGP SPF speakers peer solely with one or more Route
   Reflectors [RFC4456] or controllers.  As in the previous model,
   direct connection discovery and liveliness detection for those links
   in the BGP SPF routing domain are done outside of the BGP protocol.
   BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised as long as the corresponding link
   is considered up as per the chosen liveness detection mechanism.

   This peering model, known as sparse peering, allows for fewer BGP
   sessions and, consequently, fewer instances of the same NLRI received
   from multiple peers.  Normally, the route-reflectors or controller
   BGP sessions would be on directly-connected links to avoid dependence
   on another routing protocol for session connectivity.  However,
   multi-hop peering is not precluded.  The number of BGP sessions is
   dependent on the redundancy requirements and the stability of the BGP
   sessions.  This is discussed in greater detail in
   [I-D.ietf-lsvr-applicability].

5.  BGP Shortest Path Routing (SPF) Protocol Extensions

5.1.  BGP-LS Shortest Path Routing (SPF) SAFI

   In order to replace the existing BGP decision process with an SPF-
   based decision process in a backward compatible manner by not
   impacting the BGP-LS SAFI, this document introduces the BGP-LS-SPF
   SAFI.  The BGP-LS-SPF (AFI 16388 / SAFI 80) [RFC4760] is allocated by
   IANA as specified in the Section 8.  In order for two BGP SPF
   speakers to exchange BGP SPF NLRI, they MUST exchange the
   Multiprotocol Extensions Capability [RFC5492] [RFC4760] to ensure
   that they are both capable of properly processing such NLRI.  This is
   done with AFI 16388 / SAFI 80 for BGP-LS-SPF advertised within the
   BGP SPF Routing Domain.  The BGP-LS-SPF SAFI is used to carry IPv4
   and IPv6 prefix information in a format facilitating an SPF-based
   decision process.

5.1.1.  BGP-LS-SPF NLRI TLVs

   The NLRI format of BGP-LS-SPF SAFI uses exactly same format as the
   BGP-LS AFI [RFC7752].  In other words, all the TLVs used in BGP-LS
   AFI are applicable and used for the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.  These TLVs
   within BGP-LS-SPF NLRI advertise information that describes links,
   nodes, and prefixes comprising IGP link-state information.

   In order to compare the NLRI efficiently, it is REQUIRED that all the
   TLVs within the given NLRI must be ordered in ascending order by the
   TLV type.  For multiple TLVs of same type within a single NLRI, it is
   REQUIRED that these TLVs are ordered in ascending order by the TLV



Patel, et al.            Expires 19 August 2022                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   value field.  Comparison of the value fields is performed by treating
   the entire value field as a hexadecimal string.  NLRIs having TLVs
   which do not follow the ordering rules MUST be considered as
   malformed and discarded with appropriate error logging.

   [RFC7752] defines certain NLRI TLVs as a mandatory TLVs.  These TLVs
   are considered mandatory for the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI as well.  All the
   other TLVs are considered as an optional TLVs.

   Given that there is a single BGP-LS Attribute for all the BGP-LS-SPF
   NLRI in a BGP Update, Section 3.3, [RFC7752], a BGP Update will
   normally contain a single BGP-LS-SPF NLRI since advertising multiple
   NLRI would imply identical attributes.

5.1.2.  BGP-LS Attribute

   The BGP-LS attribute of the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI uses exactly same format
   of the BGP-LS AFI [RFC7752].  In other words, all the TLVs used in
   BGP-LS attribute of the BGP-LS AFI are applicable and used for the
   BGP-LS attribute of the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.  This attribute is an
   optional, non-transitive BGP attribute that is used to carry link,
   node, and prefix properties and attributes.  The BGP-LS attribute is
   a set of TLVs.

   The BGP-LS attribute may potentially grow large in size depending on
   the amount of link-state information associated with a single Link-
   State NLRI.  The BGP specification [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP
   message size of 4096 octets.  It is RECOMMENDED that an
   implementation support [RFC8654] in order to accommodate larger size
   of information within the BGP-LS Attribute.  BGP SPF speakers MUST
   ensure that they limit the TLVs included in the BGP-LS Attribute to
   ensure that a BGP update message for a single Link-State NLRI does
   not cross the maximum limit for a BGP message.  The determination of
   the types of TLVs to be included by the BGP SPF speaker originating
   the attribute is outside the scope of this document.  When a BGP SPF
   speaker finds that it is exceeding the maximum BGP message size due
   to addition or update of some other BGP Attribute (e.g., AS_PATH), it
   MUST consider the BGP-LS Attribute to be malformed and the attribute
   discard handling of [RFC7606] applies.

   In order to compare the BGP-LS attribute efficiently, it is REQUIRED
   that all the TLVs within the given attribute must be ordered in
   ascending order by the TLV type.  For multiple TLVs of same type
   within a single attribute, it is REQUIRED that these TLVs are ordered
   in ascending order by the TLV value field.  Comparison of the value
   fields is performed by treating the entire value field as a
   hexadecimal string.  Attributes having TLVs which do not follow the
   ordering rules MUST NOT be considered as malformed.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   All TLVs within the BGP-LS Attribute are considered optional unless
   specified otherwise.

5.2.  Extensions to BGP-LS

   [RFC7752] describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE
   information can be collected from IGPs and shared with external
   components using the BGP protocol.  It describes both the definition
   of the BGP-LS NLRI that advertise links, nodes, and prefixes
   comprising IGP link-state information and the definition of a BGP
   path attribute (BGP-LS attribute) that carries link, node, and prefix
   properties and attributes, such as the link and prefix metric or
   auxiliary Router-IDs of nodes, etc.  This document extends the usage
   of BGP-LS NLRI for the purpose of BGP SPF calculation via
   advertisement in the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.

   The protocol identifier specified in the Protocol-ID field [RFC7752]
   will represent the origin of the advertised NLRI.  For Node NLRI and
   Link NLRI, this MUST be the direct protocol (4).  Node or Link NLRI
   with a Protocol-ID other than direct will be considered malformed.
   For Prefix NLRI, the specified Protocol-ID MUST be the origin of the
   prefix.  The local and remote node descriptors for all NLRI MUST
   include the BGP Identifier (TLV 516) and the AS Number (TLV 512)
   [RFC7752].  The BGP Confederation Member (TLV 517) [RFC7752] is not
   appliable and SHOULD not be included.  If TLV 517 is included, it
   will be ignored.

5.2.1.  Node NLRI Usage

   The Node NLRI MUST be advertised unconditionally by all routers in
   the BGP SPF routing domain.

5.2.1.1.  BGP-LS-SPF Node NLRI Attribute SPF Capability TLV

   The SPF capability is an additional Node Attribute TLV.  This
   attribute TLV MUST be included with the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI and SHOULD
   NOT be used for other SAFIs.  The TLV type 1180 will be assigned by
   IANA.  The Node Attribute TLV will contain a single-octet SPF
   algorithm as defined in [RFC8665].

   The SPF algorithm inherits the values from the IGP Algorithm Types
   registry [RFC8665].  Algorithm 0, (Shortest Path Algorithm (SPF)
   based on link metric, is supported and described in Section 6.3.
   Support for other algorithm types is beyond the scope of this
   specification.

   When computing the SPF for a given BGP routing domain, only BGP nodes
   advertising the SPF capability TLV with same SPF algorithm will be
   included in the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) Section 6.3.  An
   implementation MAY optionally log detection of a BGP node that has
   either not advertised the SPF capability TLV or is advertising the
   SPF capability TLV with an algorithm type other than 0.

5.2.1.2.  BGP-LS-SPF Node NLRI Attribute SPF Status TLV

   A BGP-LS Attribute TLV of the BGP-LS-SPF Node NLRI is defined to
   indicate the status of the node with respect to the BGP SPF
   calculation.  This will be used to rapidly take a node out of service
   Section 6.5.2 or to indicate the node is not to be used for transit
   (i.e., non-local) traffic Section 6.3.  If the SPF Status TLV is not
   included with the Node NLRI, the node is considered to be up and is
   available for transit traffic.  The SPF status is acted upon with the
   execution of the next SPF calculation Section 6.3.  A single TLV type
   will be shared by the BGP-LS-SPF Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI.  The
   TLV type 1184 will be assigned by IANA.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   The BGP-LS-SPF Node Attribute SPF Status TLV, Link Attribute SPF
   Status TLV, and Prefix Attribute SPF Status TLV use the same TLV Type
   (1184).  This implies that a BGP Update cannot contain multiple NLRI
   with differing status.  If the BGP-LS-SPF Status TLV is advertised
   and the advertised value is not defined for all NLRI included in the
   BGP update, then the SPF Status TLV is ignored and not used in SPF
   computation but is still announced to other BGP SPF speakers.  An
   implementation MAY log an error for further analysis.

   If a BGP SPF speaker received the Node NLRI but the SPF Status TLV is
   not received, then any previously received information is considered
   as implicitly withdrawn and the update is propagated to other BGP SPF
   speakers.  A BGP SPF speaker receiving a BGP Update containing a SPF
   Status TLV in the BGP-LS attribute [RFC7752] with a value that is
   outside the range of defined values SHOULD be processed and announced
   to other BGP SPF speakers.  However, a BGP SPF speaker MUST NOT use
   the Status TLV in its SPF computation.  An implementation MAY log
   this condition for further analysis.

5.2.2.  Link NLRI Usage

   The criteria for advertisement of Link NLRI are discussed in
   Section 4.

   Link NLRI is advertised with unique local and remote node descriptors
   dependent on the IP addressing.  For IPv4 links, the link's local
   IPv4 (TLV 259) and remote IPv4 (TLV 260) addresses will be used.  For
   IPv6 links, the local IPv6 (TLV 261) and remote IPv6 (TLV 262)
   addresses will be used.  For unnumbered links, the link local/remote
   identifiers (TLV 258) will be used.  For links supporting having both
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both sets of descriptors MAY be included in
   the same Link NLRI.  The link identifiers are described in table 5 of
   [RFC7752].

   For a link to be used in Shortest Path Tree (SPT) for a given address
   family, i.e., IPv4 or IPv6, both routers connecting the link MUST
   have an address in the same subnet for that address family.  However,
   an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix associated with the link MAY be installed
   without the corresponding address on the other side of link.

   The link IGP metric attribute TLV (TLV 1095) MUST be advertised.  If
   a BGP SPF speaker receives a Link NLRI without an IGP metric
   attribute TLV, then it SHOULD consider the received NLRI as a
   malformed and the receiving BGP SPF speaker MUST handle such
   malformed NLRI as 'Treat-as-withdraw' [RFC7606].  The BGP SPF metric
   length is 4 octets.  Like OSPF [RFC2328], a cost is associated with
   the output side of each router interface.  This cost is configurable
   by the system administrator.  The lower the cost, the more likely the

   interface is to be used to forward data traffic.  One possible
   default for metric would be to give each interface a cost of 1 making
   it effectively a hop count.  Algorithms such as setting the metric
   inversely to the link speed as supported in the OSPF MIB [RFC4750]
   MAY be supported.  However, this is beyond the scope of this
   document.  Refer to Section 10.1.1 for operational guidance.

   The usage of other link attribute TLVs is beyond the scope of this
   document.

5.2.2.1.  BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI Attribute Prefix-Length TLVs

   Two BGP-LS Attribute TLVs of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI are defined to
   advertise the prefix length associated with the IPv4 and IPv6 link
   prefixes derived from the link descriptor addresses.  The prefix
   length is used for the optional installation of prefixes
   corresponding to Link NLRI as defined in Section 6.3.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      | Prefix-Length |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Prefix-length - A one-octet length restricted to 1-32 for IPv4
                        Link NLRI endpoint prefixes and 1-128 for IPv6
                        Link NLRI endpoint prefixes.

   The Prefix-Length TLV is only relevant to Link NLRIs.  The Prefix-
   Length TLVs MUST be discarded as an error and not passed to other BGP
   peers as specified in [RFC7606] when received with any NLRIs other
   than Link NRLIs.  An implementation MAY log an error for further
   analysis.

   The maximum prefix-length for IPv4 Prefix-Length TLV is 32 bits.  A
   prefix-length field indicating a larger value than 32 bits MUST be
   discarded as an error and the received TLV is not passed to other BGP
   peers as specified in [RFC7606].  The corresponding Link NLRI is
   considered as malformed and MUST be handled as 'Treat-as-withdraw'.
   An implementation MAY log an error for further analysis.

   The maximum prefix-length for IPv6 Prefix-Length Type is 128 bits.  A
   prefix-length field indicating a larger value than 128 bits MUST be
   discarded as an error and the received TLV is not passed to other BGP
   peers as specified in [RFC7606].  The corresponding Link NLRI is
   considered as malformed and MUST be handled as 'Treat-as-withdraw'.
   An implementation MAY log an error for further analysis.

5.2.2.2.  BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI Attribute SPF Status TLV

   A BGP-LS Attribute TLV of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is defined to
   indicate the status of the link with respect to the BGP SPF
   calculation.  This will be used to expedite convergence for link
   failures as discussed in Section 6.5.1.  If the SPF Status TLV is not
   included with the Link NLRI, the link is considered up and available.
   The SPF status is acted upon with the execution of the next SPF
   calculation Section 6.3.  A single TLV type will be shared by the
   Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI.  The TLV type 1184 will be assigned by
   IANA.

                        255 - Reserved

   The BGP-LS-SPF Node Attribute SPF Status TLV, Link Attribute SPF
   Status TLV, and Prefix Attribute SPF Status TLV use the same TLV Type
   (1184).  This implies that a BGP Update cannot contain multiple NLRI
   with differing status.  If the BGP-LS-SPF Status TLV is advertised
   and the advertised value is not defined for all NLRI included in the
   BGP update, then the SPF Status TLV is ignored and not used in SPF
   computation but is still announced to other BGP SPF speakers.  An
   implementation MAY log an error for further analysis.

   If a BGP SPF speaker received the Link NLRI but the SPF Status TLV is
   not received, then any previously received information is considered
   as implicitly withdrawn and the update is propagated to other BGP SPF
   speakers.  A BGP SPF speaker receiving a BGP Update containing an SPF
   Status TLV in the BGP-LS attribute [RFC7752] with a value that is
   outside the range of defined values SHOULD be processed and announced
   to other BGP SPF speakers.  However, a BGP SPF speaker MUST NOT use
   the Status TLV in its SPF computation.  An implementation MAY log
   this information for further analysis.

5.2.3.  IPv4/IPv6 Prefix NLRI Usage

   IPv4/IPv6 Prefix NLRI is advertised with a Local Node Descriptor and
   the prefix and length.  The Prefix Descriptors field includes the IP
   Reachability Information TLV (TLV 265) as described in [RFC7752].
   The Prefix Metric attribute TLV (TLV 1155) MUST be advertised.  The
   IGP Route Tag TLV (TLV 1153) MAY be advertised.  The usage of other
   attribute TLVs is beyond the scope of this document.  For loopback
   prefixes, the metric should be 0.  For non-loopback prefixes, the
   setting of the metric is a local matter and beyond the scope of this
   document.

5.2.3.1.  BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI Attribute SPF Status TLV

   A BGP-LS Attribute TLV to BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI is defined to
   indicate the status of the prefix with respect to the BGP SPF
   calculation.  This will be used to expedite convergence for prefix
   unreachability as discussed in Section 6.5.1.  If the SPF Status TLV
   is not included with the Prefix NLRI, the prefix is considered
   reachable.  A single TLV type will be shared by the Node, Link, and
   Prefix NLRI.  The TLV type 1184 will be assigned by IANA.

   with differing status.  If the BGP-LS-SPF Status TLV is advertised
   and the advertised value is not defined for all NLRI included in the
   BGP update, then the SPF Status TLV is ignored and not used in SPF
   computation but is still announced to other BGP SPF speakers.  An
   implementation MAY log an error for further analysis.

   If a BGP SPF speaker received the Prefix NLRI but the SPF Status TLV
   is not received, then any previously received information is
   considered as implicitly withdrawn and the update is propagated to
   other BGP SPF speakers.  A BGP SPF speaker receiving a BGP Update
   containing an SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS attribute [RFC7752] with a
   value that is outside the range of defined values SHOULD be processed
   and announced to other BGP SPF speakers.  However, a BGP SPF speaker
   MUST NOT use the Status TLV in its SPF computation.  An
   implementation MAY log this information for further analysis.

5.2.4.  BGP-LS Attribute Sequence-Number TLV

   A BGP-LS Attribute TLV of the BGP-LS-SPF NLRI types is defined to
   assure the most recent version of a given NLRI is used in the SPF
   computation.  The Sequence-Number TLV is mandatory for BGP-LS-SPF
   NLRI.  The TLV type 1181 has been assigned by IANA.  The BGP-LS
   Attribute TLV will contain an 8-octet sequence number.  The usage of
   the Sequence Number TLV is described in Section 6.1.

   be incremented for every self-originated version of BGP-LS-SPF NLRI.
   BGP SPF speakers implementing this specification MUST use available
   mechanisms to preserve the sequence number's strictly increasing
   property for the deployed life of the BGP SPF speaker (including cold
   restarts).  One mechanism for accomplishing this would be to use the
   high-order 32 bits of the sequence number as a wrap/boot count that
   is incremented any time the BGP router loses its sequence number
   state or the low-order 32 bits wrap.

   When incrementing the sequence number for each self-originated NLRI,
   the sequence number should be treated as an unsigned 64-bit value.
   If the lower-order 32-bit value wraps, the higher-order 32-bit value

   should be incremented and saved in non-volatile storage.  If a BGP
   SPF speaker completely loses its sequence number state (e.g., the BGP
   SPF speaker hardware is replaced or experiences a cold-start), the
   BGP NLRI selection rules (see Section 6.1) will insure convergence,
   albeit not immediately.

   The Sequence-Number TLV is mandatory for BGP-LS-SPF NLRI.  If the
   Sequence-Number TLV is not received then the corresponding Link NLRI
   is considered as malformed and MUST be handled as 'Treat-as-
   withdraw'.  An implementation MAY log an error for further analysis.

5.3.  NEXT_HOP Manipulation

   All BGP peers that support SPF extensions would locally compute the
   LOC-RIB Next-Hop as a result of the SPF process.  Consequently, the
   Next-Hop is always ignored on receipt.  The Next-Hop address MUST be
   encoded as described in [RFC4760].  BGP SPF speakers MUST interpret
   the Next-Hop address of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute as an IPv4 address
   whenever the length of the Next-Hop address is 4 octets, and as a
   IPv6 address whenever the length of the Next-Hop address is 16
   octets.

   [RFC4760] modifies the rules of NEXT_HOP attribute whenever the
   multiprotocol extensions for BGP-4 are enabled.  BGP SPF speakers
   MUST set the NEXT_HOP attribute according to the rules specified in
   [RFC4760] as the BGP-LS-SPF routing information is carried within the
   multiprotocol extensions for BGP-4.

6.  Decision Process with SPF Algorithm

   The Decision Process described in [RFC4271] takes place in three
   distinct phases.  The Phase 1 decision function of the Decision
   Process is responsible for calculating the degree of preference for
   each route received from a BGP SPF speaker's peer.  The Phase 2
   decision function is invoked on completion of the Phase 1 decision
   function and is responsible for choosing the best route out of all
   those available for each distinct destination, and for installing
   each chosen route into the LOC-RIB.  The combination of the Phase 1
   and 2 decision functions is characterized as a Path Vector algorithm.

   The SPF based Decision process replaces the BGP Decision process
   described in [RFC4271].  This process starts with selecting only
   those Node NLRI whose SPF capability TLV matches with the local BGP
   SPF speaker's SPF capability TLV value.  Since Link-State NLRI always
   contains the local node descriptor Section 5.2, each NLRI is uniquely
   originated by a single BGP SPF speaker in the BGP SPF routing domain
   (the BGP node matching the NLRI's Node Descriptors).  Instances of
   the same NLRI originated by multiple BGP SPF speakers would be

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   indicative of a configuration error or a masquerading attack
   (Section 9).  These selected Node NLRI and their Link/Prefix NLRI are
   used to build a directed graph during the SPF computation as
   described below.  The best routes for BGP prefixes are installed in
   the RIB as a result of the SPF process.

   When BGP-LS-SPF NLRI is received, all that is required is to
   determine whether it is the most recent by examining the Node-ID and
   sequence number as described in Section 6.1.  If the received NLRI
   has changed, it will be advertised to other BGP-LS-SPF peers.  If the
   attributes have changed (other than the sequence number), a BGP SPF
   calculation will be triggered.  However, a changed NLRI MAY be
   advertised immediately to other peers and prior to any SPF
   calculation.  Note that the BGP MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer
   and MinASOriginationIntervalTimer [RFC4271] timers are not applicable
   to the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.  The scheduling of the SPF calculation, as
   described in Section 6.3, is an implementation issue.  Scheduling MAY
   be dampened consistent with the SPF back-off algorithm specified in
   [RFC8405].

   The Phase 3 decision function of the Decision Process [RFC4271] is
   also simplified since under normal SPF operation, a BGP SPF speaker
   MUST advertise the changed NLRIs to all BGP peers with the BGP-LS-SPF
   AFI/SAFI and install the changed routes in the Global RIB.  The only
   exception are unchanged NLRIs or stale NLRIs, i.e., NLRI received
   with a less recent (numerically smaller) sequence number.

6.1.  BGP NLRI Selection

   The rules for all BGP-LS-SPF NLRIs selection for phase 1 of the BGP
   decision process, section 9.1.1 [RFC4271], no longer apply.

   1.  Routes originated by directly connected BGP SPF peers are
       preferred.  This condition can be determined by comparing the BGP
       Identifiers in the received Local Node Descriptor and OPEN
       message.  This rule will assure that stale NLRI is updated even
       if a BGP-LS router loses its sequence number state due to a cold-
       start.

   2.  The NLRI with the most recent Sequence Number TLV, i.e., highest
       sequence number is selected.

   3.  The route received from the BGP SPF speaker with the numerically
       larger BGP Identifier is preferred.

   When a BGP SPF speaker completely loses its sequence number state,
   i.e., due to a cold start, or in the unlikely possibility that 64-bit
   sequence number wraps, the BGP routing domain will still converge.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   This is due to the fact that BGP SPF speakers adjacent to the router
   will always accept self-originated NLRI from the associated speaker
   as more recent (rule # 1).  When a BGP SPF speaker reestablishes a
   connection with its peers, any existing session will be taken down
   and stale NLRI will be replaced.  The adjacent BGP SPF speaker will
   update their NLRI advertisements, hop by hop, until the BGP routing
   domain has converged.

   The modified SPF Decision Process performs an SPF calculation rooted
   at the BGP SPF speaker using the metrics from the Link Attribute IGP
   Metric TLV (1095) and the Prefix Attribute Prefix Metric TLV (1155)
   [RFC7752].  As a result, any other BGP attributes that would
   influence the BGP decision process defined in [RFC4271] including
   ORIGIN, MULTI_EXIT_DISC, and LOCAL_PREF attributes are ignored by the
   SPF algorithm.  The NEXT_HOP attribute is discussed in Section 5.3.
   The AS_PATH and AS4_PATH [RFC6793] attributes are preserved and used
   for loop detection [RFC4271].  They are ignored during the SPF
   computation for BGP-LS-SPF NRLIs.

6.1.1.  BGP Self-Originated NLRI

   Node, Link, or Prefix NLRI with Node Descriptors matching the local
   BGP SPF speaker are considered self-originated.  When self-originated
   NLRI is received and it doesn't match the local node's NLRI content
   (including sequence number), special processing is required.

   *  If a self-originated NLRI is received and the sequence number is
      more recent (i.e., greater than the local node's sequence number
      for the NLRI), the NLRI sequence number will be advanced to one
      greater than the received sequence number and the NLRI will be
      readvertised to all peers.

   *  If self-originated NLRI is received and the sequence number is the
      same as the local node's sequence number but the attributes
      differ, the NLRI sequence number will be advanced to one greater
      than the received sequence number and the NLRI will be
      readvertised to all peers.

   *  If self-originated Link or Prefix NLRI is received and the Link or
      Prefix NLRI is no longer being advertised by the local node, the
      NLRI will be withdrawn.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   The above actions are performed immediately when the first instance
   of a newer self-originated NLRI is received.  In this case, the newer
   instance is considered to be a stale instance that was advertised by
   the local node prior to a restart where the NLRI state is lost.
   However, if subsequent newer self-originated NLRI is received for the
   same Node, Link, or Prefix NLRI, the readvertisement or withdrawal is
   delayed by 5 seconds since it is likely being advertised by a
   misconfigured or rogue BGP SPF speaker Section 9.

6.2.  Dual Stack Support

   The SPF-based decision process operates on Node, Link, and Prefix
   NLRIs that support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Whether to run a
   single SPF computation or multiple SPF computations for separate AFs
   is an implementation matter.  Normally, IPv4 next-hops are calculated
   for IPv4 prefixes and IPv6 next-hops are calculated for IPv6
   prefixes.

6.3.  SPF Calculation based on BGP-LS-SPF NLRI

   This section details the BGP-LS-SPF local routing information base
   (RIB) calculation.  The router will use BGP-LS-SPF Node, Link, and
   Prefix NLRI to compute routes using the following algorithm.  This
   calculation yields the set of routes associated with the BGP SPF
   Routing Domain.  A router calculates the shortest-path tree using
   itself as the root.  Optimizations to the BGP-LS-SPF algorithm are
   possible but MUST yield the same set of routes.  The algorithm below
   supports Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routes.  Weighted Unequal Cost
   Multi-Path routes are out of scope.  The organization of this section
   owes heavily to section 16 of [RFC2328].

   The following abstract data structures are defined in order to
   specify the algorithm.

   *  Local Route Information Base (LOC-RIB) - This routing table
      contains reachability information (i.e., next hops) for all
      prefixes (both IPv4 and IPv6) as well as BGP-LS-SPF node
      reachability.  Implementations may choose to implement this with
      separate RIBs for each address family and/or Prefix versus Node
      reachability.  It is synonymous with the Loc-RIB specified in
      [RFC4271].

   *  Global Routing Information Base (GLOBAL-RIB) - This is Routing
      Information Base (RIB) containing the current routes that are
      installed in the router's forwarding plane.  This is commonly
      referred to in networking parlance as "the RIB".

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   *  Link State NLRI Database (LSNDB) - Database of BGP-LS-SPF NLRI
      that facilitates access to all Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI.

   *  Candidate List (CAN-LIST) - This is a list of candidate Node NLRIs
      used during the BGP SPF calculation Section 6.3.  The list is
      sorted by the cost to reach the Node NLRI with the Node NLRI with
      the lowest reachability cost at the head of the list.  This
      facilitates execution of the Dijkstra algorithm Section 1.1 where
      the shortest paths between the local node and other nodes in graph
      area computed.  The CAN-LIST is typically implemented as a heap
      but other data structures have been used.

   The algorithm is comprised of the steps below:

   1.  The current LOC-RIB is invalidated, and the CAN-LIST is
       initialized to empty.  The LOC-RIB is rebuilt during the course
       of the SPF computation.  The existing routing entries are
       preserved for comparison to determine changes that need to be
       made to the GLOBAL-RIB in step 6.

   2.  The computing router's Node NLRI is updated in the LOC-RIB with a
       cost of 0 and the Node NLRI is also added to the CAN-LIST.  The
       next-hop list is set to the internal loopback next-hop.

   3.  The Node NLRI with the lowest cost is removed from the candidate
       list for processing.  If the BGP-LS Node attribute doesn't
       include an SPF Capability TLV (Section 5.2.1.1, the Node NLRI is
       ignored and the next lowest cost Node NLRI is selected from
       candidate list.  The If the BGP-LS Node attribute includes an SPF
       Status TLV (Section 5.2.1.1) indicating the node is unreachable,
       the Node NLRI is ignored and the next lowest cost Node NLRI is
       selected from candidate list.  The Node corresponding to this
       NLRI will be referred to as the Current-Node.  If the candidate
       list is empty, the SPF calculation has completed and the
       algorithm proceeds to step 6.

   4.  All the Prefix NLRI with the same Node Identifiers as the
       Current-Node will be considered for installation.  The next-
       hop(s) for these Prefix NLRI are inherited from the Current-Node.
       The cost for each prefix is the metric advertised in the Prefix
       Attribute Prefix Metric TLV (1155) added to the cost to reach the
       Current-Node.  The following will be done for each Prefix NLRI
       (referred to as the Current-Prefix):

       *  If the BGP-LS Prefix attribute includes an SPF Status TLV
          indicating the prefix is unreachable, the Current-Prefix is
          considered unreachable and the next Prefix NLRI is examined in
          Step 4.

       *  If the Current-Prefix's corresponding prefix is in the LOC-RIB
          and the LOC-RIB cost is less than the Current-Prefix's metric,
          the Current-Prefix does not contribute to the route and the
          next Prefix NLRI is examined in Step 4.

       *  If the Current-Prefix's corresponding prefix is not in the
          LOC-RIB, the prefix is installed with the Current-Node's next-
          hops installed as the LOC-RIB route's next-hops and the metric
          being updated.  If the IGP Route Tag TLV (1153) is included in
          the Current-Prefix's NLRI Attribute, the tag(s) are installed
          in the current LOC-RIB route's tag(s).

       *  If the Current-Prefix's corresponding prefix is in the LOC-RIB
          and the cost is less than the LOC-RIB route's metric, the
          prefix is installed with the Current-Node's next-hops
          replacing the LOC-RIB route's next-hops and the metric being
          updated and any route tags removed.  If the IGP Route Tag TLV
          (1153) is included in the Current-Prefix's NLRI Attribute, the
          tag(s) are installed in the current LOC-RIB route's tag(s).

       *  If the Current-Prefix's corresponding prefix is in the LOC-RIB
          and the cost is the same as the LOC-RIB route's metric, the
          Current-Node's next-hops will be merged with LOC-RIB route's
          next-hops.  If the number of merged next-hops exceeds the
          Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) limit, the number of next-hops is
          reduced with next-hops on numbered links preferred over next-
          hops on unnumbered links.  Among next-hops on numbered links,
          the next-hops with the highest IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are
          preferred.  Among next-hops on unnumbered links, the next-hops
          with the highest Remote Identifiers are preferred [RFC5307].
          If the IGP Route Tag TLV (1153) is included in the Current-
          Prefix's NLRI Attribute, the tag(s) are merged into the LOC-
          RIB route's current tags.

   5.  All the Link NLRI with the same Node Identifiers as the Current-
       Node will be considered for installation.  Each link will be
       examined and will be referred to in the following text as the
       Current-Link.  The cost of the Current-Link is the advertised IGP
       Metric TLV (1095) from the Link NLRI BGP-LS attribute added to
       the cost to reach the Current-Node.  If the Current-Node is for
       the local BGP Router, the next-hop for the link will be a direct
       next-hop pointing to the corresponding local interface.  For any
       other Current-Node, the next-hop(s) for the Current-Link will be
       inherited from the Current-Node.  The following will be done for
       each link:

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


       a.  The prefix(es) associated with the Current-Link are installed
           into the LOC-RIB using the same rules as were used for Prefix
           NLRI in the previous steps.  Optionally, in deployments where
           BGP-SPF routers have limited routing table capacity,
           installation of these subnets can be suppressed.  Suppression
           will have an operational impact as the IPv4/IPv6 link
           endpoint addresses will not be reachable and tools such as
           traceroute will display addresses that are not reachable.

       b.  If the Current-Node NLRI attributes includes the SPF status
           TLV (Section 5.2.1.2) and the status indicates that the Node
           doesn't support transit, the next link for the Current-Node
           is processed in Step 5.

       c.  If the Current-Link's NLRI attribute includes an SPF Status
           TLV indicating the link is down, the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is
           considered down and the next link for the Current-Node is
           examined in Step 5.

       d.  The Current-Link's Remote Node NLRI is accessed (i.e., the
           Node NLRI with the same Node identifiers as the Current-
           Link's Remote Node Descriptors).  If it exists, it will be
           referred to as the Remote-Node and the algorithm will proceed
           as follows:

           *  If the Remote-Node's NLRI attribute includes an SPF Status
              TLV indicating the node is unreachable, the next link for
              the Current-Node is examined in Step 5.

           *  All the Link NLRI corresponding the Remote-Node will be
              searched for a Link NLRI pointing to the Current-Node.
              Each Link NLRI is examined for Remote Node Descriptors
              matching the Current-Node and Link Descriptors matching
              the Current-Link.  For numbered links to match, the Link
              Descriptors MUST share a common IPv4 or IPv6 subnet.  For
              unnumbered links to match, the Current Link's Local
              Identifier MUST match the Remote Node Link's Remote
              Identifier and the Current Link's Remote Identifier MUST
              the Remote Node Link's Local Identifier [RFC5307].  If
              these conditions are satisfied for one of the Remote-
              Node's links, the bi-directional connectivity check
              succeeds and the Remote-Node may be processed further.
              The Remote-Node's Link NLRI providing bi-directional
              connectivity will be referred to as the Remote-Link.  If
              no Remote-Link is found, the next link for the Current-
              Node is examined in Step 5.

           *  If the Remote-Link NLRI attribute includes an SPF Status
              TLV indicating the link is down, the Remote-Link NLRI is
              considered down and the next link for the Current-Node is
              examined in Step 5.

           *  If the Remote-Node is not on the CAN-LIST, it is inserted
              based on the cost.  The Remote Node's cost is the cost of
              Current-Node added the Current-Link's IGP Metric TLV
              (1095).  The next-hop(s) for the Remote-Node are inherited
              from the Current-Link.

           *  If the Remote-Node NLRI is already on the CAN-LIST with a
              higher cost, it must be removed and reinserted with the
              Remote-Node cost based on the Current-Link (as calculated
              in the previous step).  The next-hop(s) for the Remote-
              Node are inherited from the Current-Link.

           *  If the Remote-Node NLRI is already on the CAN-LIST with
              the same cost, it need not be reinserted on the CAN-LIST.
              However, the Current-Link's next-hop(s) must be merged
              into the current set of next-hops for the Remote-Node.

           *  If the Remote-Node NLRI is already on the CAN-LIST with a
              lower cost, it need not be reinserted on the CAN-LIST.

       e.  Return to step 3 to process the next lowest cost Node NLRI on
           the CAN-LIST.

   6.  The LOC-RIB is examined and changes (adds, deletes,
       modifications) are installed into the GLOBAL-RIB.  For each route
       in the LOC-RIB:

       *  If the route was added during the current BGP SPF computation,
          install the route into the GLOBAL-RIB.

       *  If the route modified during the current BGP SPF computation
          (e.g., metric, tags, or next-hops), update the route in the
          GLOBAL-RIB.

       *  If the route was not installed during the current BGP SPF
          computation, remove the route from both the GLOBAL-RIB and the
          LOC-RIB.

6.4.  IPv4/IPv6 Unicast Address Family Interaction

   While the BGP-LS-SPF address family and the IPv4/IPv6 unicast address
   families MAY install routes into the same device routing tables, they
   will operate independently much the same as OSPF and IS-IS would
   operate today (i.e., "Ships-in-the-Night" mode).  There is no
   implicit route redistribution between the BGP address families.

   It is RECOMMENDED that BGP-LS-SPF IPv4/IPv6 route computation and
   installation be given scheduling priority by default over other BGP
   address families as these address families are considered as underlay
   SAFIs.  Similarly, it is RECOMMENDED that the route preference or
   administrative distance give active route installation preference to
   BGP-LS-SPF IPv4/IPv6 routes over BGP routes from other AFI/SAFIs.
   However, this preference MAY be overridden by an operator-configured
   policy.

6.5.  NLRI Advertisement

6.5.1.  Link/Prefix Failure Convergence

   A local failure will prevent a link from being used in the SPF
   calculation due to the IGP bi-directional connectivity requirement.
   Consequently, local link failures SHOULD always be given priority
   over updates (e.g., withdrawing all routes learned on a session) in
   order to ensure the highest priority propagation and optimal
   convergence.

   An IGP such as OSPF [RFC2328] will stop using the link as soon as the
   Router-LSA for one side of the link is received.  With a BGP
   advertisement, the link would continue to be used until the last copy
   of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is withdrawn.  In order to avoid this
   delay, the originator of the Link NLRI SHOULD advertise a more recent
   version with an increased Sequence Number TLV for the BGP-LS-SPF Link
   NLRI including the SPF Status TLV (Section 5.2.2.2) indicating the
   link is down with respect to BGP SPF.  The configurable
   LinkStatusDownAdvertise timer controls the interval that the BGP-LS-
   LINK NLRI is advertised with SPF Status indicating the link is down
   prior to withdrawal.  If the link becomes available in that period,
   the originator of the BGP-LS-SPF LINK NLRI SHOULD advertise a more
   recent version of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI without the SPF Status TLV
   in the BGP-LS Link Attributes.  The suggested default value for the
   LinkStatusDownAdvertise timer is 2 seconds.

   Similarly, when a prefix becomes unreachable, a more recent version
   of the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI SHOULD be advertised with the SPF
   Status TLV (Section 5.2.3.1) indicating the prefix is unreachable in
   the BGP-LS Prefix Attributes and the prefix will be considered

   unreachable with respect to BGP SPF.  The configurable
   PrefixStatusDownAdvertise timer controls the interval that the BGP-
   LS-Prefix NLRI is advertised with SPF Status indicating the prefix is
   unreachable prior to withdrawal.  If the prefix becomes reachable in
   that period, the originator of the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI SHOULD
   advertise a more recent version of the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI without
   the SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS Prefix Attributes.  The suggested
   default value for the PrefixStatusDownAdvertise timer is 2 seconds.

6.5.2.  Node Failure Convergence

   With BGP without graceful restart [RFC4724], all the NLRI advertised
   by a node are implicitly withdrawn when a session failure is
   detected.  If fast failure detection such as BFD is utilized, and the
   node is on the fastest converging path, the most recent versions of
   BGP-LS-SPF NLRI may be withdrawn.  This will result into an older
   version of the NLRI being used until the new versions arrive and,
   potentially, unnecessary route flaps.  For the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI, NLRI
   SHOULD NOT be implicitly withdrawn immediately to prevent such
   unnecessary route flaps.  The configurable
   NLRIImplicitWithdrawalDelay timer controls the interval that NLRI is
   retained prior to implicit withdrawal after a BGP SPF speaker has
   transitioned out of Established state.  This will not delay
   convergence since the adjacent nodes will detect the link failure and
   advertise a more recent NLRI indicating the link is down with respect
   to BGP SPF (Section 6.5.1) and the BGP SPF calculation will fail the
   bi-directional connectivity check Section 6.3.  The suggested default
   value for the NLRIImplicitWithdrawalDelay timer is 2 seconds.

7.  Error Handling

   This section describes the Error Handling actions, as described in
   [RFC7606], that are specific to SAFI BGP-LS-SPF BGP Update message
   processing.

7.1.  Processing of BGP-LS-SPF TLVs

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   Node NLRI SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752], it MUST
   ignore the received TLV and MUST NOT pass it to other BGP peers as
   specified in [RFC7606].  When discarding an associated Node NLRI with
   a malformed TLV, a BGP SPF speaker SHOULD log an error for further
   analysis.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   Link NLRI SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752], it MUST
   ignore the received TLV and MUST NOT pass it to other BGP peers as
   specified in [RFC7606].  When discarding an associated Link NLRI with
   a malformed TLV, a BGP SPF speaker SHOULD log an error for further
   analysis.

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   Prefix NLRI SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752], it MUST
   ignore the received TLV and MUST NOT pass it to other BGP peers as
   specified in [RFC7606].  When discarding an associated Prefix NLRI
   with a malformed TLV, a BGP SPF speaker SHOULD log an error for
   further analysis.

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   SPF Capability TLV in the Node NLRI BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752], it
   MUST ignore the received TLV and the Node NLRI and MUST NOT pass it
   to other BGP peers as specified in [RFC7606].  When discarding a Node
   NLRI with a malformed TLV, a BGP SPF speaker SHOULD log an error for
   further analysis.

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   IPv4 Prefix-Length TLV in the Link NLRI BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752],
   it MUST ignore the received TLV and the Node NLRI and MUST NOT pass
   it to other BGP peers as specified in [RFC7606].  The corresponding
   Link NLRI is considered as malformed and MUST be handled as 'Treat-
   as-withdraw'.  An implementation MAY log an error for further
   analysis.

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   IPv6 Prefix-Length TLV in the Link NLRI BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752],
   it MUST ignore the received TLV and the Node NLRI and MUST NOT pass
   it to other BGP peers as specified in [RFC7606].  The corresponding
   Link NLRI is considered as malformed and MUST be handled as 'Treat-
   as-withdraw'.  An implementation MAY log an error for further
   analysis.

7.2.  Processing of BGP-LS-SPF NLRIs

   A Link-State NLRI MUST NOT be considered as malformed or invalid
   based on the inclusion/exclusion of TLVs or contents of the TLV
   fields (i.e., semantic errors), as described in Section 5.1 and
   Section 5.1.1.

   A BGP-LS-SPF Speaker MUST perform the following syntactic validation
   of the BGP-LS-SPF NLRI to determine if it is malformed.

   1.  Does the sum of all TLVs found in the BGP MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
       correspond to the BGP MP_REACH_NLRI length?

   2.  Does the sum of all TLVs found in the BGP MP_UNREACH_NLRI
       attribute correspond to the BGP MP_UNREACH_NLRI length?

   3.  Does the sum of all TLVs found in a BGP-LS-SPF NLRI correspond to
       the Total NLRI Length field of all its Descriptors?

   4.  When an NLRI TLV is recognized, is the length of the TLV and its
       sub-TLVs valid?

   5.  Has the syntactic correctness of the NLRI fields been verified as
       per [RFC7606]?

   6.  Has the rule regarding ordering of TLVs been followed as
       described in Section 5.1.1?

   When the error determined allows for the router to skip the malformed
   NLRI(s) and continue processing of the rest of the update message
   (e.g., when the TLV ordering rule is violated), then it MUST handle
   such malformed NLRIs as 'Treat-as-withdraw'.  In other cases, where
   the error in the NLRI encoding results in the inability to process
   the BGP update message (e.g., length related encoding errors), then
   the router SHOULD handle such malformed NLRIs as 'AFI/SAFI disable'
   when other AFI/SAFI besides BGP-LS are being advertised over the same
   session.  Alternately, the router MUST perform 'session reset' when
   the session is only being used for BGP-LS-SPF or when its 'AFI/SAFI
   disable' action is not possible.

7.3.  Processing of BGP-LS Attribute

   A BGP-LS Attribute MUST NOT be considered as malformed or invalid
   based on the inclusion/exclusion of TLVs or contents of the TLV
   fields (i.e., semantic errors), as described in Section 5.1 and
   Section 5.1.1.

   A BGP-LS-SPF Speaker MUST perform the following syntactic validation
   of the BGP-LS Attribute to determine if it is malformed.

   1.  Does the sum of all TLVs found in the BGP-LS-SPF Attribute
       correspond to the BGP-LS Attribute length?

   2.  Has the syntactic correctness of the Attributes (including BGP-LS
       Attribute) been verified as per [RFC7606]?

   3.  Is the length of each TLV and, when the TLV is recognized then,
       its sub-TLVs in the BGP-LS Attribute valid?



Patel, et al.            Expires 19 August 2022                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   When the detected error allows for the router to skip the malformed
   BGP-LS Attribute and continue processing of the rest of the update
   message (e.g., when the BGP-LS Attribute length and the total Path
   Attribute Length are correct but some TLV/sub-TLV length within the
   BGP-LS Attribute is invalid), then it MUST handle such malformed BGP-
   LS Attribute as 'Attribute Discard'.  In other cases, when the error
   in the BGP-LS Attribute encoding results in the inability to process
   the BGP update message, then the handling is the same as described
   above for malformed NLRI.

   Note that the 'Attribute Discard' action results in the loss of all
   TLVs in the BGP-LS Attribute and not the removal of a specific
   malformed TLV.  The removal of specific malformed TLVs may give a
   wrong indication to a BGP SPF speaker that the specific information
   is being deleted or is not available.

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives an update message with Link-State
   NLRI(s) in the MP_REACH_NLRI but without the BGP-LS-SPF Attribute, it
   is most likely an indication that a BGP SPF speaker preceding it has
   performed the 'Attribute Discard' fault handling.  An implementation
   SHOULD preserve and propagate the Link-State NLRIs in such an update
   message so that the BGP SPF speaker can detect the loss of link-state
   information for that object and not assume its deletion/withdrawal.
   This also makes it possible for a network operator to trace back to
   the BGP SPF speaker which actually detected a problem with the BGP-LS
   Attribute.

   An implementation SHOULD log an error for further analysis for
   problems detected during syntax validation.

   When a BGP SPF speaker receives a BGP Update containing a malformed
   IGP metric TLV in the Link NLRI BGP-LS Attribute [RFC7752], it MUST
   ignore the received TLV and the Link NLRI and MUST NOT pass it to
   other BGP peers as specified in [RFC7606].  When discarding a Link
   NLRI with a malformed TLV, a BGP SPF speaker SHOULD log an error for
   further analysis.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the use of SAFI (80) for BGP SPF operation
   Section 5.1, and requests IANA to assign the value from the First
   Come First Serve (FCFS) range in the Subsequent Address Family
   Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters registry.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   This document also defines five attribute TLVs of BGP-LS-SPF NLRI.
   We request IANA to assign types for the SPF capability TLV, Sequence
   Number TLV, IPv4 Link Prefix-Length TLV, IPv6 Link Prefix-Length TLV,
   and SPF Status TLV from the "BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor,
   Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs" Registry.

    +=========================+=================+====================+
    | Attribute TLV           | Suggested Value | NLRI Applicability |
    +=========================+=================+====================+
    | SPF Capability          | 1180            | Node               |
    +-------------------------+-----------------+--------------------+
    | SPF Status              | 1184            | Node, Link, Prefix |

9.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a BGP SAFI, i.e., the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.  This
   document does not change the underlying security issues inherent in
   the BGP protocol [RFC4271].  The Security Considerations discussed in
   [RFC4271] apply to the BGP SPF functionality as well.  The analysis
   of the security issues for BGP mentioned in [RFC4272] and [RFC6952]
   also applies to this document.  The analysis of Generic Threats to
   Routing Protocols done in [RFC4593] is also worth noting.  As the
   modifications described in this document for BGP SPF apply to IPv4
   Unicast and IPv6 Unicast as undelay SAFIs in a single BGP SPF Routing
   Domain, the BGP security solutions described in [RFC6811] and
   [RFC8205] are somewhat constricted as they are meant to apply for
   inter-domain BGP where multiple BGP Routing Domains are typically
   involved.  The BGP-LS-SPF SAFI NLRI described in this document are
   typically advertised between EBGP or IBGP speakers under a single
   administrative domain.

   In the context of the BGP peering associated with this document, a
   BGP speaker MUST NOT accept updates from a peer that is not within
   any administrative control of an operator.  That is, a participating
   BGP speaker SHOULD be aware of the nature of its peering
   relationships.  Such protection can be achieved by manual
   configuration of peers at the BGP speaker.





Patel, et al.            Expires 19 August 2022                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


   In order to mitigate the risk of peering with BGP speakers
   masquerading as legitimate authorized BGP speakers, it is recommended
   that the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] be used to
   authenticate BGP sessions.  If an authorized BGP peer is compromised,
   that BGP peer could advertise modified Node, Link, or Prefix NLRI
   will result in misrouting, repeating origination of NLRI, and/or
   excessive SPF calculations.  When a BGP speaker detects that its
   self-originated NLRI is being originated by another BGP speaker, an
   appropriate error should be logged so that the operator can take
   corrective action.

10.  Management Considerations

   This section includes unique management considerations for the BGP-
   LS-SPF address family.

10.1.  Configuration

   All routers in BGP SPF Routing Domain are under a single
   administrative domain allowing for consistent configuration.

10.1.1.  Link Metric Configuration

   Within a BGP SPF Routing Domain, the IGP metrics for all advertised
   links SHOULD be configured or defaulted consistently.  For example,
   if a default metric is used for one router's links, then a similar
   metric should be used for all router's links.  Similarly, if the link
   cost is derived from using the inverse of the link bandwidth on one
   router, then this SHOULD be done for all routers and the same
   reference bandwidth should be used to derive the inversely
   proportional metric.  Failure to do so will not result in correct
   routing based on link metric.

10.1.2.  backoff-config

   In addition to configuration of the BGP-LS-SPF address family,
   implementations SHOULD support the "Shortest Path First (SPF) Back-
   Off Delay Algorithm for Link-State IGPs" [RFC8405].  If supported,
   configuration of the INITIAL_SPF_DELAY, SHORT_SPF_DELAY,
   LONG_SPF_DELAY, TIME_TO_LEARN, and HOLDDOWN_INTERVAL MUST be
   supported [RFC8405].  Section 6 of [RFC8405] recommends consistent
   configuration of these values throughout the IGP routing domain and
   this also applies to the BGP SPF Routing Domain.

Internet-Draft         BGP Link-State SPF Routing          February 2022


10.2.  Operational Data

   In order to troubleshoot SPF issues, implementations SHOULD support
   an SPF log including entries for previous SPF computations.  Each SPF
   log entry would include the BGP-LS-SPF NLRI SPF triggering the SPF,
   SPF scheduled time, SPF start time, SPF end time, and SPF type if
   different types of SPF are supported.  Since the size of the log will
   be finite, implementations SHOULD also maintain counters for the
   total number of SPF computations and the total number of SPF
   triggering events.  Additionally, to troubleshoot SPF scheduling and
   back-off [RFC8405], the current SPF back-off state, remaining time-
   to-learn, remaining holddown, last trigger event time, last SPF time,
   and next SPF time should be available.

11.  Implementation Status

   Note RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the associated
   references prior to publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   The BGP-LS-SPF implementation status is documented in
   [I-D.psarkar-lsvr-bgp-spf-impl].
