            JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Text Sequences
                    draft-ietf-json-text-sequence-08

Abstract

   This document describes the JSON text sequence format and associated
   media type, "application/json-seq".  A JSON text sequence consists of
   any number of JSON tests, each prefix by an Record Separator
   (U+001E), and each ending with a newline character (U+000A).

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] is a very handy
   serialization format.  However, when serializing a large sequence of
   values as an array, or a possibly indeterminate-length or never-
   ending sequence of values, JSON becomes difficult to work with.

   Consider a sequence of one million values, each possibly 1 kilobyte
   when encoded -- roughly one gigabyte.  It is often desirable to
   process such a dataset in an incremental manner: without having to
   first read all of it before beginning to produce results.
   Traditionally the way to do this with JSON is to use a "streaming"
   parser, but these are neither widely available, widely used, nor easy
   to use.

   This document describes the concept and format of "JSON text
   sequences", which are specifically not JSON texts themselves but are
   composed of (possible) JSON texts.  JSON text sequences can be parsed
   (and produced) incrementally without having to have a streaming
   parser (nor streaming encoder).

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  JSON Text Sequence Format

   Two different sets of ABNF rules are provided for the definition of
   JSON text sequences: one for parsers, and one for encoders.  Having
   two different sets of rules permits recovery by parsers from
   sequences where some the elements are truncated for whatever reason.
   The syntax for parsers is specified in terms of octet strings which
   are then interpreted as JSON texts if possible.  The syntax for
   encoders, on the other hand, assumes that sequence elements are not
   truncated.

2.1.  JSON text sequence parsing

   The ABNF [RFC5234] for the JSON text sequence parser is as given in
   Figure 1.

     JSON-sequence = *(1*RS possible-JSON)
     RS = %x1E; "record separator" (RS), see RFC20
     possible-JSON = 1*(not-RS); attempt to parse as UTF-8-encoded
                               ; JSON text (see RFC7159)
     not-RS = %x00-1d / %x1f-ff; any octets other than RS

                     Figure 1: JSON text sequence ABNF

   In prose: a series of octet strings, each containing any octet other
   than a record separator (RS) (0x1E) [RFC0020], all octet strings
   separated from each other by RS octets.  Each octet string in the
   sequence is to be parsed as a JSON text.

   If parsing of such an octet string as a JSON text fails, the parser
   SHOULD nonetheless continue parsing the remainder of the sequence.
   The parser should report such failures to applications (which might
   choose to terminate parsing of a sequence).  Multiple consecutive RS
   octets do not denote empty sequence elements between them, and can be
   ignored.

   There is no end of sequence indicator.

2.2.  JSON text sequence encoding

   The ABNF for the JSON text sequence encoder is given in Figure 2.

     JSON-sequence = *(RS JSON-text LF)
     RS = %x1E; see RFC20
     LF = %x0A; "line feed" (LF), see RFC20
     JSON-text = <given by RFC7159>

                     Figure 2: JSON text sequence ABNF

Internet-Draft             JSON Text Sequences              October 2014


   In prose: any number of JSON texts, each preceded and followed by one
   ASCII RS character and each followed by a line feed (LF).  Since RS
   is an ASCII control character it may only appear in JSON strings in
   escaped form (see [RFC7159]), and since RS may not appear in JSON
   texts in any other form, RS unambiguously delimits the start of any
   element in the sequence.  RS is sufficient to unambiguously delimit
   all top-level JSON value types other than numbers.  Following each
   JSON text in the sequence with an LF allows detection of truncated
   JSON texts consisting of a number at the top-level.

   Note that on some systems it's possible to input RS by typing
   'ctrl-^'.  This is helpful when constructing a sequence manually with
   a text editor.

2.3.  Incomplete JSON texts are not fatal

   Per- Section 2.1, JSON text sequence parsers SHOULD NOT abort when an
   octet string contains a malformed JSON text.  Such a situation may
   arise in contexts where, for example, append-writes to log files are
   truncated by the filesystem (e.g., due to a crash, or administrative
   process termination).

2.4.  Top-level numeric values

   Parsers MUST check that any JSON texts that are a top-level number
   include JSON whitespace ("ws" ABNF rule from [RFC7159]) after the
   number, otherwise the JSON-text may have been truncated.  Parsers
   MUST NOT report JSON-text sequence elements consisting of top-level
   numbers that may have been truncated in the same way they would a
   complete JSON-text.  Parsers MAY report such texts as errors
   (including, optionally, the parsed text and/or the original octet
   string).

3.  Security Considerations

   All the security considerations of JSON [RFC7159] apply.  This format
   provides no cryptographic integrity protection of any kind.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The MIME media type for JSON text sequences is application/json-seq.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: json-seq

   Required parameters: n/a

   Optional parameters: n/a

   Encoding considerations: binary

   Security considerations: See <this document, once published>,
   Section 3.

   Interoperability considerations: Described herein.

   Published specification: <this document, once published>.

   Applications that use this media type: <by publication time
   <https://stedolan.github.io/jq> is likely to support this format>.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Phillip Hallam-Baker proposed the use of JSON text sequences for
   logfiles and pointed out the need for resynchronization.  Stephen
   Dolan created <https://github.com/stedolan/jq>, which uses something
   like JSON text sequences (with LF as the separator between texts on
   output, and requiring only such whitespace as needed to disambiguate
   on input).  Carsten Bormann suggested the use of ASCII RS, and Joe
   Hildebrand suggested the use of LF in addition to RS for
   disambiguating top-level number values.  Paul Hoffman shepherded the
   Internet-Draft.  Many others contributed reviews and comments on the
   JSON Working Group mailing list.
