1.  Disclaimer and Introduction

   BCP 9 [RFC2026] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for
   many years.  This is a personal review of how some aspects of the
   process work in practice, written with the perspective of an RFC
   author, former WG chair, and current IESG and IAB member.  The focus
   is mainly on how the community, and the IESG in particular,
   interprets the formal rules in actual practice.  It should be
   remembered that RFC 2026 has served the IETF well for approximately
   ten years and the majority of it works very well as written.

   Newcomers to the IETF should first read the Tao of the IETF
   [I-D.hoffman-taobis].  For a guide to all IETF process documents, see
   [I-D.carpenter-procdoc-roadmap].

   Extracts from RFC 2026 are presented verbatim in quotation marks,

 Abstract

    This memo documents the process used by the Internet community for
    the standardization of protocols and procedures.  It defines the
    stages in the standardization process, the requirements for moving a
    document between stages and the types of documents used during this
    process.  It also addresses the intellectual property rights and
    copyright issues associated with the standards process.

1.1  Internet Standards

   ...
   The Internet Standards Process described in this document is
   concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are
   used in or by the Internet, whether or not they are part of the
   TCP/IP protocol suite.  In the case of protocols developed and/or
   standardized by non-Internet organizations, however, the Internet
   Standards Process normally applies to the application of the protocol
   or procedure in the Internet context, not to the specification of the
   protocol itself.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   In view of recent experience with the temporary Sub-IP Area, and
   current experience with L2VPN, L3VPN, PWE3 and MPLS, it seems that
   this paragraph takes a rather simple view.  Emulation of transmission
   mechanisms over IP, the IETF's involvement in multiprotocol switching
   through MPLS, and the general layer confusion induced by VPNs means
   that things are not as easily delimited as the above paragaph
   suggests.  Some IETF standards are quite interwoven with standards
   from other organizations, and hence liaison relationships have become
   complex and important.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

 1.2  The Internet Standards Process
    ...
    o  These procedures are explicitly aimed at recognizing and adopting
       generally-accepted practices.  Thus, a candidate specification
       must be implemented and tested for correct operation and
       interoperability by multiple independent parties and utilized in
       increasingly demanding environments, before it can be adopted as
       an Internet Standard.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   This is an important statement of principle.  In fact, if some of the
   more radical proposals for simplifying the standards track had been
   adopted, it is unclear whether this principle could honestly be left
   in place.  (The antithesis is of course a priori standardization, in
   which a specification is declared a standard without demonstrated
   interoperability.)  It is a fact that relatively few standards
   advance beyond the Proposed Standard stage, and hence the mechanisms
   for documenting interoperability are often not used.

   o  These procedures provide a great deal of flexibility to adapt to
      the wide variety of circumstances that occur in the
      standardization process.  Experience has shown this flexibility to
      be vital in achieving the goals listed above.

   The goal of technical competence, the requirement for prior
   implementation and testing, and the need to allow all interested
   parties to comment all require significant time and effort.  On the
   other hand, today's rapid development of networking technology
   demands timely development of standards.  The Internet Standards
   Process is intended to balance these conflicting goals.  The process
   is believed to be as short and simple as possible without sacrificing
   technical excellence, thorough testing before adoption of a standard,
   or openness and fairness.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   One of the main criticisms of recent years has been that this balance
   has not been achieved and the process has been too slow.  However, it
   is unclear that this is is truly a matter of process failure rather
   than procedural failure.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

2.1  Requests for Comments (RFCs)
   ...
   The RFC series of documents on networking began in 1969 as part of
   the original ARPA wide-area networking (ARPANET) project (see
   Appendix A for glossary of acronyms).  RFCs cover a wide range of
   topics in addition to Internet Standards, from early discussion of
   new research concepts to status memos about the Internet.  RFC
   publication is the direct responsibility of the RFC Editor, under the
   general direction of the IAB.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Today, the RFC Editor's work for the IETF is also under the
   administrative management of the IASA [RFC4071].

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      The rules for formatting and submitting an RFC are defined in [5].

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Note that [I-D.rfc-editor-rfc2223bis] is applied today.

         *  A stricter requirement applies to standards-track    *
         *  specifications:  the ASCII text version is the       *
         *  definitive reference, and therefore it must be a     *
         *  complete and accurate specification of the standard, *
         *  including all necessary diagrams and illustrations.  *
         *                                                       *
         *********************************************************


   -----------End Extract---------"

   There are certainly people in the IETF who want to change this, to
   allow normative reference to figures and mathematics that are not
   readily expressed in ASCII.  However, there are also strong arguments
   that if something cannot be expressed in the linearized format of
   pure ASCII, it cannot be expressed unambiguously anyway.  Up to now,
   this requirement has remained in force.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      The status of Internet protocol and service specifications is
      summarized periodically in an RFC entitled "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" [1].  This RFC shows the level of maturity and
      other helpful information for each Internet protocol or service
      specification (see section 3).

   -----------End Extract---------"

   This was written before a hyperlinked index was available on line.
   At this writing, this RFC has not been updated for two years.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      Some RFCs document Internet Standards.  These RFCs form the 'STD'
      subseries of the RFC series [4].  When a specification has been
      adopted as an Internet Standard, it is given the additional label
      "STDxxx", but it keeps its RFC number and its place in the RFC
      series. (see section 4.1.3)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It seems that the fact that full Standards receive the STD
   designation, and that PS and DS documents do not, is a major source
   of confusion to users of the standards.  Users do not, in fact, know
   where to look for the latest standard, since a DS may obsolete an
   STD, and a PS may obsolete either.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   Some RFCs standardize the results of community deliberations about
   statements of principle or conclusions about what is the best way to
   perform some operations or IETF process function.  These RFCs form
   the specification has been adopted as a BCP, it is given the
   additional label "BCPxxx", but it keeps its RFC number and its place
   in the RFC series. (see section 5)

   Not all specifications of protocols or services for the Internet
   should or will become Internet Standards or BCPs.  Such non-standards
   track specifications are not subject to the rules for Internet
   standardization.  Non-standards track specifications may be published
   directly as "Experimental" or "Informational" RFCs at the discretion
   of the RFC Editor in consultation with the IESG (see section 4.2).

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Factually, the RFC Editor does not have such discretion for IETF
   documents - it's the IESG approval that defines the status of an IETF
   RFC.  IETF Experimental or Informational RFCs are distinct from
   independent submissions to the RFC Editor, which are now processed
   under [RFC3932].

   "---------Begin Extract---------

  2.2  Internet-Drafts

     During the development of a specification, draft versions of the
     document are made available for informal review and comment by
     placing them in the IETF's "Internet-Drafts" directory, which is
     replicated on a number of Internet hosts.  This makes an evolving
     working document readily available to a wide audience, facilitating
     the process of review and revision.

     An Internet-Draft that is published as an RFC, or that has remained
     unchanged in the Internet-Drafts directory for more than six months
     without being recommended by the IESG for publication as an RFC, is
     ...

   -----------End Extract---------"

   This is inaccurate.  Expiry is inhibited when a draft enters IESG
   consideration, not when it is approved.

      simply removed from the Internet-Drafts directory.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   However,
   1.  Drafts are also removed from the directory after publication as
       an RFC.
   2.  All drafts are retained in the IETF archive for legal reasons.
   3.  This archive could have value to national patent offices and/or
       WIPO as part of their prior art databases.
   4.  Expired drafts are unofficially visible in many places.
   5.  Authors may request expired drafts to be removed from such
       visibility (in some countries, this is a legal right).

   It's also worth noting that the published RFC will not be textually
   identical to the final version of the draft.  Not only will the
   boilerplate be finalized; the RFC Editor will also make editorial
   corrections, and any minor technical changes following IESG review
   will be applied.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

 3.1  Technical Specification (TS)

    A Technical Specification is any description of a protocol, service,
    procedure, convention, or format.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It seems clear that this does not limit a TS to defining a wire
   protocol - it doesn't exclude APIs, for example (an API is clearly a
   convention).  It includes data definitions such as MIBs (a MIB is
   clearly a format).  It doesn't exclude a standard that only defines
   an IANA registry (a registry is also a format).  Yet all of these
   things have led to debate in the IETF - even in 2006 we have seen
   debate about whether a document that only defines a registry can
   become a Proposed Standard.  It seems clear that a TS must be both
   implementable and testable - but even this is subject to
   interpretation.  Also see later comments on interoperability testing.

...
   A TS shall include a statement of its scope and the general intent
   for its use (domain of applicability).  Thus, a TS that is inherently
   specific to a particular context shall contain a statement to that
   effect.  However, a TS does not specify requirements for its use
   within the Internet;  these requirements, which depend on the
   particular context in which the TS is incorporated by different
   system configurations, are defined by an Applicability Statement.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   The last sentence is unclear.  Is it saying that a TS doesn't contain
   operational guidelines?  Quite often, the Operations Area comments on
   a draft TS are, in effect, asking for operational guidelines.  If a
   TS refers to a timeout or some other behavioural parameter,
   Operations people may insist on specifying a default value and
   guidance about when to change the default.  But the above sentence
   could suggest that this belongs in a separate AS.  In practice, few
   authors separate such things from the basic specification.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

3.2  Applicability Statement (AS)

   An Applicability Statement specifies how, and under what
   circumstances, one or more TSs may be applied to support a particular
   Internet capability.  An AS may specify uses for TSs that are not
   Internet Standards, as discussed in Section 7.

   An AS identifies the relevant TSs and the specific way in which they
   are to be combined, and may also specify particular values or ranges
   of TS parameters or subfunctions of a TS protocol that must be
   implemented.  An AS also specifies the circumstances in which the use
   of a particular TS is required, recommended, or elective (see section
   3.3).

   An AS may describe particular methods of using a TS in a restricted
   "domain of applicability", such as Internet routers, terminal
   servers, Internet systems that interface to Ethernets, or datagram-
   based database servers.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   The community really doesn't have the habit of writing this sort of
   separate AS; it's rare, and very rare in WG charters.  In fact, an AS
   of this style, covering a set of related TS documents of various
   maturities, would be very similar to the type of Internet Standards
   description document that was discussed by the newtrk WG.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      The broadest type of AS is a comprehensive conformance specification,

   -----------End Extract---------"

   The IETF community has shown reluctance to enter the business of
   writing conformance specifications.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      commonly called a "requirements document", for a particular class of
      Internet systems, such as Internet routers or Internet hosts.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Today, we use the word "requirements" much more broadly, often as a
   front-end document when a WG is starting out.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   An AS may not have a higher maturity level in the standards track
   than any standards-track TS on which the AS relies (see section 4.1).
   For example, a TS at Draft Standard level may be referenced by an AS
   at the Proposed Standard or Draft Standard level, but not by an AS at
   the Standard level.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   There is nothing specific to ASes in this rule; it is applied
   globally wherever normative references occur.  See comment below on
   4.2.4.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   3.3  Requirement Levels

   -----------End Extract---------"

   This section assumes a sophistication in ASes that is very rare, but
   is in practice applied more generally.  It provides the basis on
   which the normative keywords [RFC2119] are built.

 ...
    (e)  Not Recommended:  A TS that is considered to be inappropriate
       for general use is labeled "Not Recommended". This may be because
       of its limited functionality, specialized nature, or historic
       status.

    Although TSs and ASs are conceptually separate, in practice a
    standards-track document may combine an AS and one or more related
    TSs.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It would be much clearer to the reader if this was said at the
   beginning of this section.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

...
   The "Official Protocol Standards" RFC (STD1) lists a general
   requirement level for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in this
   section. This RFC is updated periodically.  In many cases, more
   detailed descriptions of the requirement levels of particular
   protocols and of individual features of the protocols will be found
   in appropriate ASs.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   As noted, STD1 is rarely updated today.  How this is really done in
   the RFC archive is an operational matter.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

  4.1.1  Proposed Standard
  ...
     Implementors should treat Proposed Standards as immature
     specifications.  It is desirable to implement them in order to gain
     experience and to validate, test, and clarify the specification.
     However, since the content of Proposed Standards may be changed if
     problems are found or better solutions are identified, deploying
     implementations of such standards into a disruption-sensitive
     environment is not recommended.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It is well known that to a large extent this warning has been
   ignored, and that the Internet "runs on Proposed Standards."  Also,
   as the MIB doctors have observed, some types of spec may benefit from
   being recycled at this level rather than being "promoted."  In

   reality today:
   1.  Proposed Standard (PS) is the preliminary level.
   2.  Implementors should be aware that a PS may be revised or even
       withdrawn.
   3.  It is nevertheless common to use PS implementations
       operationally.
   4.  Many documents spend their entire active life as PS.
   5.  Certain types of specification are likely to be recycled at PS as
       they evolve rather than being promoted.  (Sometimes this is
       simply a result of complexity, but other times it's due to
       intrinsic difficulties in interoperability testing and normative
       dependencies.)

   "---------Begin Extract---------

4.1.2  Draft Standard
...
   A specification from which at least two independent and interoperable
   implementations from different code bases have been developed, and
   for which sufficient successful operational experience has been
   obtained, may be elevated to the "Draft Standard" level.  For the
   purposes of this section, "interoperable" means to be functionally
   equivalent or interchangeable components of the system or process in
   which they are used.  If patented or otherwise controlled technology
   is required for implementation, the separate implementations must
   also have resulted from separate exercise of the licensing process.
   Elevation to Draft Standard is a major advance in status, indicating
   a strong belief that the specification is mature and will be useful.

   The requirement for at least two independent and interoperable
   implementations applies to all of the options and features of the
   specification.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   At least four significant questions arise repeatedly in interpreting
   this.
   1.  What is a "feature"?  This can be interpreted in many ways.  For
       a TLV field is every separate type code a feature?  Is every
       normative keyword [RFC2119] a feature?
   2.  Is it acceptable if features A and B are shown to be
       interoperable between implementations X and Y, and features C and
       D are shown to be interoperable between implentations P and Q?
       In that case we have shown interoperability of features A, B, C
       and D but have not shown that any implementation successfully
       interoperates with all of them.

       At least for the strong security requirement of BCP 61 [RFC3365],

       the Security Area, with the support of the IESG, has insisted
       that all specifications include at least one mandatory-to-
       implement strong security mechanism to guarantee universal
       interoperability.
   3.  Is it acceptable if both implementations X and Y show
       interoperability with implementation Q, but the implementor of Q
       is not party to the tests and does not make any statements about
       features supported?  In other words Q has merely served as an
       active mirror in the tests.
   4.  How should we handle the issue of "single-ended" technical
       specifications such as data formats, where there is no new
       protocol whose interoperation we can verify?  A practical
       solution for MIBs has been documented [RFC2438] and some
       generalisation of this seems to be needed.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   In cases in which one or more options or features
   have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable
   implementations, the specification may advance to the Draft Standard
   level only if those options or features are removed.

   The Working Group chair is responsible for documenting the specific
   implementations which qualify the specification for Draft or Internet
   Standard status along with documentation about testing of the
   interoperation of these implementations.  The documentation must
   include information about the support of each of the individual
   options and features.  This documentation should be submitted to the
   Area Director with the protocol action request. (see Section 6)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It seems that we need to specify the minimum acceptable contents of
   an interoperability report in considerably more detail than this.
   Examining the database of reports collected over the years at
   http://www.ietf.org/IESG/implementation.html, the quality is highly
   variable and some are very sparse and uninformative.

   source of user confusion is that these acronyms are not associatd
   with PS and DS documents.  It would be less confusing if a new or
   existing acronym was assigned as part of the initial standards action
   (thus RFC 2821 would have been associated with SMTP).  It's also a
   matter for debate whether the STD number should be assigned at PS
   stage for simpler tracking - thus RFC 2821 could also be known as
   PS10, for example.

4.2.1  Experimental

   The "Experimental" designation typically denotes a specification that
   is part of some research or development effort.  Such a specification
   is published for the general information of the Internet technical
   community and as an archival record of the work, subject only to
   editorial considerations and to verification that there has been
   adequate coordination with the standards process (see below).  An
   Experimental specification may be the output of an organized Internet
   research effort (e.g., a Research Group of the IRTF), an IETF Working
   Group, or it may be an individual contribution.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   The IESG has been concerned about the scope of "experiments" on the
   Internet and the lack of clear guidelines as to which experiments we
   should document in the IETF and to what extent we should be concerned
   about operational consequences.  In fact, the IESG asked the
   community for discussion on this point.  It's also worth looking at
   http://www.ietf.org/u/ietfchair/draft-iesg-info-exp-01.html .

   "---------Begin Extract---------

4.2.2  Informational

   An "Informational" specification is published for the general
   information of the Internet community, and does not represent an
   Internet community consensus or recommendation.  The Informational
   designation is intended to provide for the timely publication of a
   very broad range of responsible informational documents from many
   sources, subject only to editorial considerations and to verification
   that there has been adequate coordination with the standards process
   (see section 4.2.3).

   In practice, some Informationals and Experimentals that are published

      Specifications that have been prepared outside of the Internet
      community and are not incorporated into the Internet Standards
      Process by any of the provisions of section 10 may be published as
      Informational RFCs, with the permission of the owner and the
      concurrence of the RFC Editor.

   This presumably means "outside of the IETF process" not "outside of
   the Internet community."  As part of this year's RFC Editor RFP
   process, clarity is being sought about the independent submissions
   track, which should probably not be discussed at all in the basic
   definition of the standards process.  See

   4.2.3  Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs

      Unless they are the result of IETF Working Group action, documents
      intended to be published with Experimental or Informational status
      should be submitted directly to the RFC Editor.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   That's often not what happens.  Many of them come via an AD through
   the IESG because they are (for example) related to a recently closed
   WG etc.  These are processed and approved entirely within the IETF.

   Not done in practice.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   To ensure that the non-standards track Experimental and Informational
   designations are not misused to circumvent the Internet Standards
   Process, the IESG and the RFC Editor have agreed that the RFC Editor
   will refer to the IESG any document submitted for Experimental or
   Informational publication which, in the opinion of the RFC Editor,
   may be related to work being done, or expected to be done, within the
   IETF community.  The IESG shall review such a referred document
   within a reasonable period of time, and recommend either that it be
   published as originally submitted or referred to the IETF as a
   contribution to the Internet Standards Process.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   The current practice for this is defined in [RFC3932].

   "---------Begin Extract---------

4.2.4  Historic

   A specification that has been superseded by a more recent
   specification or is for any other reason considered to be obsolete is
   assigned to the "Historic" level.  (Purists have suggested that the
   word should be "Historical"; however, at this point the use of
   "Historic" is historical.)

   Note: Standards track specifications normally must not depend on
   other standards track specifications which are at a lower maturity
   level or on non standards track specifications other than referenced
   specifications from other standards bodies.  (See Section 7.)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   The first paragraph has not been implemented consistently.  In many
   cases a standards track RFC that has been obsoleted by a more recent
   version is not listed in the RFC Index as Historic.

   The second paragraph is applied generally.  Furthermore, a clear
   distinction is now required between Normative and Informative
   references.  Also, the requirement for Normative references to be
   published (i.e. not work in progress) is applied to all

   Also note the variance procedure of [RFC3967] for allowing normative
   reference to less mature documents.

5.  BEST CURRENT PRACTICE (BCP) RFCs

   The BCP subseries of the RFC series is designed to be a way to
   standardize practices and the results of community deliberations.  A
   BCP document is subject to the same basic set of procedures as
   standards track documents and thus is a vehicle by which the IETF
   community can define and ratify the community's best current thinking
   on a statement of principle or on what is believed to be the best way
   to perform some operations or IETF process function.

   Historically Internet standards have generally been concerned with
   the technical specifications for hardware and software required for
   computer communication across interconnected networks.  However,
   since the Internet itself is composed of networks operated by a great
   variety of organizations, with diverse goals and rules, good user
   service requires that the operators and administrators of the
   Internet follow some common guidelines for policies and operations.
   While these guidelines are generally different in scope and style
   from protocol standards, their establishment needs a similar process
   for consensus building.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It is sometimes unclear whether a given document should be standards
   track, BCP or informational (and in the end, it may not really
   matter).  For example, how should the IESG classify a document which
   recommends against a particular operational practice that has been
   found to be damaging?  It might amend a technical specification (by
   removing a feature); it might limit the applicability of a protocol
   (and therefore be an applicability statement); it might be a BCP
   defining a "worst current practice"; or it might fit none of the
   above.

   While it is recognized that entities such as the IAB and IESG are
   composed of individuals who may participate, as individuals, in the
   technical work of the IETF, it is also recognized that the entities
   themselves have an existence as leaders in the community.  As leaders
   in the Internet technical community, these entities should have an
   outlet to propose ideas to stimulate work in a particular area, to
   raise the community's sensitivity to a certain issue, to make a
   statement of architectural principle, or to communicate their
   thoughts on other matters.  The BCP subseries creates a smoothly
   structured way for these management entities to insert proposals into
   the consensus-building machinery of the IETF while gauging the
   community's view of that issue.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Although it's not unknown for a BCP to have its origin in the IESG or
   IAB, IETF consensus is still needed, as judged by the IESG.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

6.1.1  Initiation of Action

   A specification that is intended to enter or advance in the Internet
   standards track shall first be posted as an Internet-Draft (see
   section 2.2) unless it has not changed since publication as an RFC.
   It shall remain as an Internet-Draft for a period of time, not less
   than two weeks, that permits useful community review, after which a
   recommendation for action may be initiated.

   A standards action is initiated by a recommendation by the IETF
   Working group responsible for a specification to its Area Director,
   copied to the IETF Secretariat or, in the case of a specification not
   associated with a Working Group, a recommendation by an individual to
   the IESG.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   In practice, individual submissions are recommended to and shepherded
   by an AD, who brings them to the IESG just like a WG document.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   6.1.3  Publication

      If a standards action is approved, notification is sent to the RFC
      Editor and copied to the IETF with instructions to publish the
      specification as an RFC.  The specification shall at that point be
      removed from the Internet-Drafts directory.

   "At that point" refers to the moment of publication of the RFC.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

6.2  Advancing in the Standards Track
...
   Change of status shall result in republication of the specification
   as an RFC, except in the rare case that there have been no changes at
   all in the specification since the last publication.  Generally,
   desired changes will be "batched" for incorporation at the next level
   in the standards track.  However, deferral of changes to the next
   standards action on the specification will not always be possible or
   desirable; for example, an important typographical error, or a
   technical error that does not represent a change in overall function
   of the specification, may need to be corrected immediately.  In such
   cases, the IESG or RFC Editor may be asked to republish the RFC (with
   a new number) with corrections, and this will not reset the minimum
   time-at-level clock.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Note that the RFC Editor maintains errata for published RFCs.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   When a standards-track specification has not reached the Internet
   Standard level but has remained at the same maturity level for
   twenty-four (24) months, and every twelve (12) months thereafter
   until the status is changed, the IESG shall review the viability of
   the standardization effort responsible for that specification and the
   usefulness of the technology. Following each such review, the IESG
   shall approve termination or continuation of the development effort,
   at the same time the IESG shall decide to maintain the specification
   at the same maturity level or to move it to Historic status.  This
   decision shall be communicated to the IETF by electronic mail to the
   IETF Announce mailing list to allow the Internet community an
   opportunity to comment. This provision is not intended to threaten a
   legitimate and active Working Group effort, but rather to provide an
   administrative mechanism for terminating a moribund effort.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   No IESG has ever had the cycles to do this.  It is left to community
   initiative to propose promotion of documents.

   6.5  Conflict Resolution and Appeals

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It's possible to read this as applying only to IESG actions described
   in this section 6.  The IESG and IAB have preferred to read it as
   applying to any IESG decision whatever.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

6.5.1 Working Group Disputes
...
   If the disagreement cannot be resolved by the Area Director(s) any of
   the parties involved may then appeal to the IESG as a whole.  The
   IESG shall then review the situation and attempt to resolve it in a
   manner of its own choosing.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It is unclear how much due diligence is expected of the IESG.  Today
   there is a tendency in the IESG to believe that even if an appeal is
   of doubtful merit, they need to plunge in great detail into the
   documents and mail archives concerned, and reaching a conclusion can
   take an inordinate amount of time and stress.  Should the IESG take a
   more summary approach to appeals, or does the community want the IESG
   to spend a substantial amount of time on each appeal?  (Same comments
   apply to section 6.5.2.)
