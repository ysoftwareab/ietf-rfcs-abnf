Abstract

   This document defines an 'untypedObject' structural object class for
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500.  This is
   useful for entries with no 'natural' choice of structural object
   class, e.g. if an entry must exist even though its contents are
   uninteresting.

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP object class 'untypedObject'       January 2006


1. Introduction

   An entry in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377]
   or [X.500] directory must have a structural object class, such as
   'person' or 'country'.  However, an entry may lack a 'natural' choice
   of structural object class.  For example, the desired structure of a
   directory tree might require an entry to exist for grouping purposes
   even though it describes no real-world object.  This document defines
   an 'untypedObject' structural object class for this use.

   As 'untypedObject' structural object class doesn't have any mandatory
   attributes, it can also be used in combination with arbitrary
   auxiliary object classes.  For example, the posixGroup object class
   [LDAP-NIS] is an auxiliary object class that may be used to overlay
   POSIX group identification on an existing group of distinguished
   names.  In this case, it is suggested that the groupOfUniqueNames
   object class be used as a structural object class. However, this may
   sometimes be inappropriate: that groupOfUnique- Names requires at
   least one member may make it impossible to migrate existing group
   information. [LDAP-NIS] could define a specific struc- tural object
   class for this case (say, structuralPosixGroup), but this would
   unnecessarily add to the proliferation of redundant schema.


2. Object class definition

   untypedObject is defined as follows.  The definition uses the BNF
   form of ObjectClassDescription from [RFC2252], but with lines folded
   for readability.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID NAME 'untypedObject'
        DESC 'Entry of no particular type [RFC XXXX]'
        SUP top STRUCTURAL
        MAY ( c $ cn $ dc $ l $ o $ ou $ st $ street $ uid $
              description $ owner $ seeAlso ) )

   The attribute types are defined in [RFC2256], except for 'dc' in
   [RFC2247] and 'uid' in [RFC2798].

   The name of an entry with this object class will normally be a cn,
   but attributes c through uid are allowed as well in case the entry
   name relates to the name of something else.  Of these, only the one
   used for naming is intended to be used in the entry.  Use of the
   others may be an indication that the entry should have a more
   descriptive object class instead of or in addition to this one.

3. Example

   In a directory with entries named as follows, the entries with RDNs
   cn=people etc. can use untypedObject:

                  uid=john,cn=people,dc=example,dc=com
         uid=john,cn=users,cn=system,dc=example,dc=com
      cn=www,cn=filegroups,cn=system,dc=example,dc=com

   This document raises no known security issues.

Appendix A: Notes on choices made for the object class

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   The c through uid attributes (for naming of entries) match the table
   of naming attributes in [RFC2253] (UTF-8 String Representation of
   Distinguished Names), in case the entry's RDN needs to match the RDN
   of something else.

   The description, owner and seeAlso attributes seem good to offer for
   "nothing in particular"-kind of entries, since such entries might not
   contain anything else which indicates what they are for and who is
   responsible for them.


Appendix B: Issues for consideration

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   Is the name of this object class properly reflects its purpose?

   Is the choice of naming attributes good?
