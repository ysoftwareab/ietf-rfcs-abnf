    Signature Link Relation for Cryptographic Resource Verification
                draft-palmer-signature-link-relation-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a way to associate web resources with their
   corresponding digital signatures.  A signature can then be verified
   automatically during the process of downloading a resource.
   Infomation presented to the user about the verification results may
   enable them to make wiser security decisions about downloaded
   content.

1.  Introduction

   Links to downloadable content on the web are sometimes accompanied by
   a further link to a digital signature.  The digital signature proves
   that the content is signed, and hence endorsed, by the owner or
   owners of a secret cryptographic key.  Digital signature links are,
   however, presently embedded in documents in an ad hoc fashion making
   the automatic checking of signatures difficult.  As a result, user
   workflow is to download content and signatures individually,
   requiring them to locate both files in the local filesystem and pass
   them to verification software external to their web client.
   Verification software is often terminal based, and has attracted
   criticism for poor user interface decisions [DJB].  The existing
   signature workflow exacerbates this problem, and makes it much less
   likely that a user will verify content compared to if their client
   had performed these steps for them.

   For signature verification to be automated, content must be
   associated with signatures through metadata in a structured and
   machine-readable way.  This document provides such metadata in the
   form of a link relation called "signature" (Section 2).  An HTML
   attribute called "rels" (Section 3) is also provided, which allows
   the link relations of a resource to be known before any request is
   made.  When a web client such as a browser implements this metadata,
   the user can be automatically presented with a summary of the
   verification process, including whether it succeeded or failed, and
   what the claimed identity and web of trust characteristics are of the
   signing key.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           Signature Link Relation           December 2015


2.  Link relation

   This section defines a new link relation called "signature".  The
   value of this link relation is a cryptographic digital signature of
   the resource to which the link relation applies.  The value SHOULD
   identify an OpenPGP detached signature as defined in Section 11.4 of
   [RFC4880], with the syntax specified in Section 6.2 of [RFC4880].
   The target resource SHOULD be served with the media type
   "application/pgp-signature" as defined in [RFC3156].  Other formats
   MUST be distinguished either by a separate media type, or by
   extension of the OpenPGP syntax specified in Section 6.2 of
   [RFC4880].

   Example of the use of this relation in HTML:

       <link rel="signature" href="index.html.sig">

   In formats which use URLs as properties, the following URL may be
   used as a link relation property once registered with the IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of [RFC5988]:

       http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/signature

3.  Hypertext attribute

   This section defines a "rels" attribute, for use on all elements
   where "rel" is permitted in HTML ([RFC2854]) and in all contexts
   where HTML content is permitted such as in applications of XML
   ([XML]).  The syntax of the "rels" attribute value is a whitespace
   separated sequence of whitespace separated pairs of link relations
   and URL values.  Relative URL values are resolved against the current
   resource URL as a base, not the target of the "href" attribute.  The
   effect is that each pair of link relations and URL values applies to
   the resource identified by the "href" attribute.

   The "rels" attribute allows the discovery of the link relationships
   of a hyperlinked resource before any request is made.  It may, for
   example, be used in conjunction with "signature" link relation:

       You may download the signed <a href="software.tar.gz"
       rels="signature software.tar.gz.sig">software</a>.

4.  Security Considerations

   The extensive security considerations listed in Section 14 of
   [RFC4880] also apply here.
