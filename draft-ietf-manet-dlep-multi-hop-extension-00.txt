1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Link Event Protocol (DLEP) is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep].  It provides the exchange of link related
   control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised of
   a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as well
   as support for possible extensions.  This document defines one such
   extension.

   Some modem technologies support connectivity to destinations via
   multi-hop forwarding.  DLEP Destination messages can be used to
   report such connectivity, see [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep], but do not
   provide any information related to the number or capacity of the
   hops.  The extension defined in this document enables modems to
   inform routers when multi-hop forwarding is being used, and routers
   to request that modems change multi-hop forwarding behavior.  The
   extension defined in this document is referred to as "Multi-Hop
   Forwarding".

   This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in Section 2
   which is used to indicate the use of the extension, and three new
   DLEP Data Items in Section 3.

Internet-Draft          DLEP Multi-Hop Extension           February 2017


1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Extension Usage and Identification

   The use of the Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension SHOULD be configurable.
   To indicate that the extension is to be used, an implementation MUST
   include the Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension Type Value in the
   Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data Item
   is sent and processed according to [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep].

   The Multi-Hop Forwarding Extension Type Value is TBA1, see Section 5.

3.  Extension Data Items

   Three data items are defined by this extension.  The Hop Count Data
   Item is used by a modem to provide the number of network hops
   traversed to reach a particular destination.  The Hop Control Data
   Item is used by a router to request that a modem alter connectivity
   to a particular destination.  The Suppress Forwarding Data Item is
   used by a router to request that a modem disable multi-hop forwarding
   on either a device or destination basis.

3.1.  Hop Count

   The Hop Count Data Item is used by a modem to indicate the number of
   physical hops between the modem and a specific destination.  In other
   words, each hop represents a transmission and the number of hops is
   equal to the number of transmissions required to go from a router
   connected modem to the destination's connected modem.  The minimum
   number of hops is 1, which represents the router's locally connected
   modem.

   The data item also contains an indication of when a destination which
   currently has a hop count of greater than one (1) could be made
   direcly reachable by a modem, e.g., by re-aiming an antenna.

   The Hop Count Data Item SHOULD be carried in the Destination Up,
   Destination Update, Destination Announce Response, and Link
   Characteristics Response Messages when the Hop Count to a destination
   is greater than one (1).

   A router receiving a Hop Count Data Item MAY use this information in
   its forwarding and routing decisions, and specific use is out of

   scope of this document.  The absence of the Hop Count Data Item MUST
   be interpreted by the router as a Hop Count value of one (1).

   The format of the Hop Count Data Item is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Data Item Type:  TBA2

   Length:  4

   Hop Count:

      An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the number of network hops
      required (i.e., number of times a packet will be transmitted) to
      reach the destination indicated in the message.  The special value
      of 255 (0xFF) is used to indicate that the number of hops is an
      unknown number greater than one (1).  This field MUST contain a
      value of at least one (1) if the associated destination is
      reachable.

      A value of zero (0) is used to indicated that processing of a Hop
      Control action, see Section 3.2, has resulted in a destination no
      longer being reachable.  A zero value MUST NOT be used in any
      message other then a Destination Announce Response Message.

   P:

      The P-bit indicates that a destination is potentially directly
      reachable.  When the P-bit is set, the router MAY request a direct
      link to the associated destination using the Hop Control Data Item
      described below.

   Reserved:

      MUST be set to zero by the sender (a modem) and ignored by the
      receiver (a router).

3.2.  Hop Control

   The Hop Control Data Item is used by a router to request a change in
   connectivity to a particular destination, or in multi-hop processing
   on a device wide basis.  A router can request multi-hop reachable
   destination be changed to a single hop.  A router can also indicate
   that the modem terminate connectivity to a particular destination.

   The Hop Control Data Item MAY be carried in the Session Update
   Message or Destination Announce Message.

   A router that receives the Hop Control in a Session Update Message
   SHOULD attempt to make the change indicated by the data item for the
   whole device.  Results of any changes made are reflected in
   Destination Down and Destination Update Messages.  The modem MUST
   notify the router of each destination that is no longer reachable via
   a Destination Down Message.  The modem MUST notify the router of any
   changes in Hop Counts via Destination Update Messages.

   A router that receives the Hop Control in a Destination Announce
   Message SHOULD attempt to make the change indicated by the data item
   for the associated destination MAC address.  Once the change is made,
   or fails or is rejected, the modem MUST respond with a Destination
   Announce Response Message containing an updated Hop Count Data Item.

   The format of the Hop Control Data Item is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

                    Table 1: Hop Control Actions Values

3.2.1.  Reset

   The Reset Action requests that the default behavior be restored.
   When received in a Session Update Message message, a modem SHOULD
   clear all control actions that have previously been processed on a
   device wide basis, and revert to its configured behavior.  When
   received in a Destination Announce Message, a modem SHOULD clear all
   control actions that have previously been processed for the
   destination indicated in the message.

3.2.2.  Terminate

   The Terminate Action is only valid on a per destination basis and
   MUST NOT be sent in a Session Update Message message.  It indicates
   that the modem SHOULD attempt to terminate communication with the
   destination identified in the message.  This request has no impact
   for multi-hop destinations and may fail even in a single hop case,
   i.e. MAY result in the Hop Count to the destination not being
   impacted by the processing of the request

3.2.3.  Direct Connection

   The Direct Connection is only valid on a per destination basis and
   MUST NOT be sent in a Session Update Message message.  It indicates
   that the modem SHOULD attempt to establish a direct connection with
   the destination identified in the message.  This action SHOULD only
   be sent for destinations for which the Hop Count is greater than 1
   and has the P-Bit set in the previously received Hop Count Data Item.
   Results of the request for the destination identified in the message
   are provided as described above.  If any other destination is
   impacted in the processing of this action, the modem MUST send a
   Destination Update Message for each impacted destination.

Internet-Draft          DLEP Multi-Hop Extension           February 2017


3.2.4.  Suppress Forwarding

   The Suppress Forwarding Action is used by a router to indicate to its
   peer that multi-hop forwarding is to be suppressed.  A router may
   request that multi-hop forwarding may be suppressed on a device wide
   or destination specific basis.

   A modem which receives the Suppress Forwarding Data Item in a Session
   Update Message MUST suppress multi-hop forwarding on a device wide
   basis.  Impact to destination hop counts are provided to the router
   by the modem as described above.

   A modem which receives the Suppress Forwarding Data Item in a
   Destination Announce Message MUST suppress multi-hop forwarding for
   only the destination indicated in the message.  Results are provided
   as described above.

4.  Security Considerations

   The extension introduces a new mechanism for flow control between a
   router and modem using the DLEP protocol.  The extension does not
   inherently introduce any additional threats above those documented in
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep].  The approach taken to Security in that
   document applies equally when running the extension defined in this
   document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the assignment of 3 values by IANA.  All
   assignments are to registries defined by [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep].  It
   also requests creation of one new registry.

5.1.  Extension Type Value

   This document requests 1 new assignment to the DLEP Extensions
   Registry named "Extension Tyoe Values" in the range with the
   "Specification Required" policy.  The requested value is as follows:

                      +------+----------------------+
                      | Code | Description          |

   Registry named "Data Item Values" in the range with the
   "Specification Required" policy.  The requested values are as
   follows:

5.3.  Hop Control Actions Registry

   Upon approval of this document, IANA is requested to create a new
   DLEP registry, named "Hop Control Actions Values".  The following
   table provides initial registry values and the [RFC5226]. defined
   policies that should apply to the registry:
