    LSP Encoding Type and Signal Type together identify the unique signal 
    type of the LSP. 


3.1 LSP Encoding

    LSP Encoding Type: 8 bit 

    Indicates the encoding technology of the LSP being requested.
    
                 Value        Type
                 -----        --------
                 3            ANSI PDH
                 4            ETSI PDH
                 5            SDH
                 6            SONET
                 7            OTN
                 8            Analog


3.2 Signaling Type and Associated G-PID

    Signaling Type: 24 bits 

    Indicates the specific signal type of the LSP being requested. This 
    field is interpreted according to the technology specified by LSP 
    Encoding Type. The Signal Type provides transit switches with the 
    information required to determine which link connection can support 
    the LSP.

    
    G-PID: 16 bits
 
    Indicates the payload carried by an LSP, i.e. an identifier of the 
    client layer of the LSP.  It's the same as Payload Types in G.709, 
    Signal Label in G.707 and L3PID in RSVP-TE. Each of signal type may 
    only allow certain types of client signals. The G-PID is mainly used by 
    the adaptation layer function at the LSP terminating points. G-PID is 
    associated with each signal type.

Internet Draft      G-Label and G-Label Request Specification      March 2001


   The "MS-X" and "STM-X" Signal types represent transparent STM Multiplex 
   Section and Regenerator Section LSPs respectively. Note that the "STM-X" 
   signal type represents the complete STM-N signal, including all its SOH.

   The "VC-n-Xc" Signal Type represents a contiguous standard concatenated 
   VC-n signal (ITU-T Rec. G.707), which is transported via the AU and TU 
   timeslots according to the (E,D,C,B,A) and (K,L,M) structures.

   The "VC-n-Xv" Signal type represents a virtual concatenated VC-n signal. 

   The "VC-n-Xv LCAS" Signal type represents a VC-n-Xv signal with Link 
   Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS) capability. The "VC-n-X" Signal type 
   represents a group of VC-n signals that are to be co-routed. 

   Besides the set of signal types derived from the SDH standards, a number of 
   additional signal types are defined. These additional signal types are 
   vendor specific extensions of the SDH standards.

   The "AUG-X" Signal type represents an AUG-X bandwidth, of which the 
   specific AU structure is not predefined. This AUG-X link will autonomously 
   adapt to the incoming AU structure. Idem for TUG-2 and TUG-3.

   The "VC-4-Xa" Signal type represents a contiguous arbitrary concatenated 
   VC-4 signal.

   The "STM-Xst" Signal type represents a "semi transparent" STM-X signal. The 
   AUG-X and some of the SOH (vendor specific selection) is transported 
   through the link connection. Interworking between equipment of different 
   vendors is not to be expected.

   To support other vendor specific SDH signal types a set of 13 code points 
   (133-143) is reserved. Within its subnetwork a vendor may assign these code 
   points to its specific signals.

   The G-PIDs associated with each Signal Type are (based on G.707):
      VC-11:     (1) async 1.544 Mbps, (2) bit sync 1.544 Mbps, (3) byte sync

   The "STS-X Line" and "STS-X" Signal types represent transparent STS Line 
   and STS Section LSPs respectively. Note that the "STS-X" signal type 
   represents the complete STS-N signal, including all its TOH.

   The "STS-Xc" Signal Type represents a contiguous standard concatenated STS 
   signal (ANSI T1.105), which is transported via the STS timeslots according 
   to the (E,D,C,B,A) structures.

   The "VTn-Xv" and "STS-n-Xv" Signal types represent virtual concatenated VT    
   and STS signals. The "VTn-Xv LCAS" and "STS-n-Xv LCAS" Signal type 
   represent VTn-Xv and STS-n-Xv signal with Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme 
   (LCAS) capability. The "VTn-X" and "STS-n-X" Signal types represent a group 
   of VTn and STS-n signals that are to be co-routed. 

   Besides the set of signal types derived from the SONET standards, a number 
   of additional signal types are defined. These additional signal types are 
   vendor specific extensions of the SONET standards.

   The "STS Group-X" Signal type represents an STS Group bandwidth, of which 
   the specific STS structure is not predefined. This STS Group-X link will 
   autonomously adapt to the incoming STS structure. Idem VTG.

   The "STS-3c-Xa" Signal type represents a contiguous arbitrary concatenated 
   STS-3c signal.

   The "STS-Xst" Signal type represents a "semi transparent" STS-X signal. The 
   STS-X SPE and some of the TOH (vendor specific selection) is transported 
   through the link connection. Inter-working between equipment of different 
   vendors is not to be expected.

   To support other vendor specific SONET signal types a set of 13 code points 
   (132-143) is reserved. Within its subnetwork a vendor may assign these code 
   points to its specific signals.

Internet Draft      G-Label and G-Label Request Specification      March 2001


4.2 G-Label Channel ID for SONET/SDH

    For SDH/SONET, the label identifies both a timeslot in the SDH/SONET frame 
    as well as a Connection Termination Point (CTP) in the equipment.

    The Channel ID of the G-label represents for SDH/SONET either the AU/STS 
    timeslots or the TU/VT timeslots.

    SDH/SONET are technologies encompassing multiple independent layer 
    networks. Trails and connections in layer networks are set up and torn 
    down independent of trails and connections in their server layer networks. 
    Trails and connections in layer networks are modified independent of 
    trails and connections in their server and client layer networks.

    Typically, server layer trails must have been set up before client layer 
    connections and trails can be set up. Server layer trails provide the 
    client layer link connections (label switched hops). As such, STM-N/OC-N 
    (i.e. multiplex section/line) trails must have been established before 
    HOVC connections and trails can be set up. Similarly, VC-4/STS-1 trails 
    must have been established before LOVC/VT connections and trails can be 
    set up.

    There is a multiplicity of ports (physical and logical) in SDH/SONET 
    equipment; STM-N/OC-N physical ports, HOVC/STS logical ports, LOVC/VT 
    logical ports. In future hybrid OTN/SDH/SONET equipment STM-N/OC-N ports 
    might also be logical ports.

    HOVC/STS signals can be transported over STM-N/OC-N signals. LOVC/VT 
    signals can be transported over either VC-4/VC-3/STS-1 signals, or sub-
    STM-0/sub-STS-1 signals (e.g. sSTM-1k [k=1,2,4,8,16], sSTM-2n [n=1,2,4]), 
    or 34 376 and 139 264 kbit/s signals with G.832 framing.

    STM-N/OC-N signals aggregate HOVC/STS signals. The associated multiplex 
    structure may be adapted during the lifetime of the STM-N/OC-N trail to 
    accommodate the requested mix of HOVC/STS signal types. VC-4/VC-3/STS-1 
    signals aggregate LOVC/VT signals. The associated multiplex structure may 
    be adapted during the lifetime of the VC-4/VC-3/STS-1 trail to accommodate 
    the requested mix of LOVC/VT signal types. At any moment in time, the 
    complete aggregation bandwidth's multiplex structure must be defined to 
    prevent alarms to be raised.

    SDH/SONET equipment may have either no switch fabric, or a HOVC/STS switch 
    fabric, or a LOVC/VT switch fabric, or a HOVC/STS and a LOVC/VT switch 
    fabric. SDH/SONET interfaces on none-SDH/SONET equipment typically have no 
    switch fabric. Hybrid equipment may have SDH/SONET type switch fabrics in 
    addition to client layer (e.g. ATM VP, ATM, VC, IP, Ethernet) switch 
    fabrics and/or server layer (e.g. OTN OCh, OTN ODUk) switch fabrics. 

    Installing fibers between equipment will establish physical layer trails, 
     


Z. Lin et. al.                                                     Page [11]

Internet Draft      G-Label and G-Label Request Specification      March 2001


    but most likely no HOVC/STS or LOVC/VT trails, despite that there might be 
    some SDH/SONET interfaces without switch fabrics connected at the edge of 
    the (sub)network.

    Therefore, HOVC/STS labels are independent of LOVC/VT labels. Each one 
    will have a dedicated Channel ID.


4.2.1. HOVC/STS specific Channel ID in STM-N/OC-N

    The latest version of G.707 (10/00) has defined a naming structure for 
    the AU's, similar to that for the TU's. AUs are now named according the 
    (E,D,C,B,A) structure (TUs are named according the (K,L,M) structure). 
    This (E,D,C,B,A) structure identifies the AU type, the location in the 
    STM-N/OC-N frame and at the same time implies a restriction on the AU-4-
    Xc/STS-Xc types and the timeslots these signals can be transported over.
    Vendor specific extensions exist that have fewer restrictions. To 
    accommodate both cases in a single channel ID structure, HOVC/STS channel 
    IDs are represented by means of the "SU" structure. A conversion between 
    (E,D,C,B,A) and SU is included.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   1. S is the index of a particular AUG-X/STS-X, AU/STS, STM-Xst signal.
      S=1->N indicates the first timeslot of a specific AUG-X/STS-X,
 
      AU/STS, STM-Xst inside an STM-N/STS-N multiplex. For example, S=1 
      indicates the first AUG-1/STS-3, and S=N indicates the last AUG-1/STS-3 of 
      this multiplex.  S=0 is invalid.

  2. U indicates if the AUG-1/STS-3 is subdivided. U=1 indicates that
     the AUG-1/STS-3 is not further subdivided and contains an
     AU-4/STS-3c. U=2->4 indicates a specific AU-3/STS-1 inside the
     given AUG-1/STS-3. For the other signals, U is not-applicable
     and is fixed to 0.

   For SDH VC-4 and VC-3, this is an extension of the numbering scheme defined 


Z. Lin et. al.                                                     Page [12]

Internet Draft      G-Label and G-Label Request Specification      March 2001


   in G.707 section 7.3, i.e. the (K, L, M) and (L,M) numbering. For 
   SONET and SDH VC-3 the K field is not significant and must be set to zero.

   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the parent
   node in the multiplex structure. Branches are considered as numbered
   in increasing order, starting from the top of the multiplexing
   structure. The numbering starts at 1, zero is used to indicate a non-
   significant field.

   When a field is not significant in a particular context it MUST be
   set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when received.

   1. K is only significant for SDH VC-4 and must be ignored for SONET and SDH 
      VC-3. It indicates a specific branch of a VC-4. K=1 indicates that the
      VC-4 is not further sub-divided and contains a C-4. K=2->4 indicates a 
      specific TUG-3 inside the VC-4.

   2. L indicates a specific branch of a TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE. It
      is not significant for an unstructured VC-4, and must be 0 in this case. 
      L=1 indicates that the TUG-3/VC-3/STS-1 SPE is not further sub-divided 
      and contains a TU-3 in SDH; It is not applicable for SONET. L=2->8
      indicates a specific TUG-2/VT Group inside the corresponding
      higher order signal.
      L=9 indicates that the TUG3 structure is not predefined;
      instead it is determined by the incoming signal and autonomously
      adapts to the TU structure of the incoming signal. This signal
      is referred to as a TUG-3. 

   3. M indicates a specific branch of a TUG-2/VT Group. It is not
      significant for an unstructured VC-4, TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1
      SPE and must be 0 in this case. M=1 indicates that the TUG-2/VT Group is  
      not further sub-divided and contains a TU-2/VT-6. M=2->3 indicates a
      specific VT-3 inside the corresponding VT Group, these values
      MUST NOT be used for SDH since there is no equivalent of VT-3
      with SDH. M=4->6 indicates a specific TU-12/VT-2 inside the     
      corresponding TUG-2/VT Group. M=7->10 indicates a specific
      TU-11/VT-1.5 inside the corresponding TUG-2/VT Group. 
      M=11 indicates that the TUG2/VTG structure is not predefined;
      instead it is determined by the incoming signal and autonomously
      adapts to the TU/VT structure of the incoming signal. This signal
      is referred to as a TUG-2/VTG.

   For SDH sSTM-2n, this is an extension of the numbering scheme defined in
   G.708, i.e. the (L,M) numbering. 

   1. L=1->n indicates a specific TUG-2/VT Group inside the sSTM-2n (n=1,2,4).
      L=5 indicates that the TUG2 structure is not predefined;
      instead it is determined by the incoming signal and autonomously
      adapts to the TU structure of the incoming signal. This signal
      is referred to as a TUG-2. 

   2. M indicates a specific branch of a TUG-2/VT Group. M=1 indicates that 
      the TUG-2/VT Group is not further sub-divided and contains a TU-2/VT-6. 
      M=2->4 indicates a specific TU-12/VT-2 inside the corresponding TUG-2/VT 
      Group. M=5->8 indicates a specific TU-11/VT-1.5 inside the corresponding 
      TUG-2/VT Group. 
      M=9 indicates that the TUG2/VTG structure is not predefined;
      instead it is determined by the incoming signal and autonomously
      adapts to the TU/VT structure of the incoming signal. This signal
      is referred to as a TUG-2/VTG.

   For SDH sSTM-1k, this is an extension of the numbering scheme defined in
   G.708, i.e. the (M) numbering. 

   1. M=1->k indicates a specific TU-12 inside the sSTM-1k (k=1,2,4,8,16).

   For the 139 264 kbit/s G.832 framed signal (P4s) option II, this is an    
   extension of the numbering scheme defined in ETSI EN 300 417-5-1, i.e. the 
   (K, L, M) numbering. 

   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the parent
   node in the multiplex structure. Branches are considered as numbered
   in increasing order, starting from the top of the multiplexing
   structure. The numbering starts at 1, zero is used to indicate a non-
   significant field.

   When a field is not significant in a particular context it MUST be
   set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when received.

   1. K indicates a specific branch of a P4s. K=1->3 indicates a specific TUG-
      3 (A, B, C) inside the P4s.

   2. L indicates a specific branch of a TUG-3. L=1 indicates that
      the TUG-3 is not further sub-divided and contains a TU-3. L=2->8 (for 
      K=3, L is limited to 2->6) indicates a specific TUG-2.

   3. M indicates a specific branch of a TUG-2. It is not significant for an 
      unstructured TUG-3 and must be 0 in this case. M=1 indicates that the 
      TUG-2 is not further sub-divided and contains a TU-2. M=2->4 indicates a 
      specific TU-12 inside the corresponding TUG-2.
