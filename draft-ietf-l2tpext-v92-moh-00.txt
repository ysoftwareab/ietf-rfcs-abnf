Abstract

   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] defines a mechanism
   for tunneling PPP [STD51] sessions.

   One of the features introduced by V.92 [V92] is the ability of the
   client modem to put the call on hold.  The L2TP base protocol does
   not provide any means to signal this event.  This document describes
   a method used to indicate when a client modem has gone on-hold.

INTERNET DRAFT   V.92 Modem-On-Hold signalling on L2TP          May 2002


1. Introduction

   L2TP defines a general purpose mechanism for tunneling PPP over
   various media.  By design, the operation of L2TP is insulated from
   the details of the media from which the PPP session originated,
   including when a V.92 client modem requests to go on-hold.  It may be
   desirable for this information to be provided to the LNS.

   There are no standard AVPs that can communicate this information.
   This document provides additional AVPs and commands that may be used
   to provide modem information.  However, it does not define what, if
   anything, the LNS should do with this information. A sample of the
   possible actions that an LNS may consider are listed in section 5.

1.1 Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].


2. Protocol Operation

   L2TP can be used in many different topologies. This document looks at
   this particular topology:

   +-----+       {      }   +-----+   [ packet  ]   +-----+   [  home   ]
   |     |-[M]---{ PSTN }---| LAC |...[ network ]...| LNS |...[ network ]
   +-----+       {      }   +-----+   [         ]   +-----+   [         ]
   Remote
   System


   M is the client modem and it may be an integral part of the Remote
   System.  If this modem implements V.92, it can request the server
   modem (part of the LAC) to go on-hold for some period of time.

   If the server modem agrees, the client modem can signal the PSTN to
   go on-hold (usually, a flash hook). The user at the remote system may
   then use the same POTS line where the client modem is connected to
   make or receive another call.

   If the LAC implements the functionality described here, it can signal
   to the LNS when the client modem has gone on-hold and when it comes
   back online.

   This document does not define what, if anything, the LNS should do
   with this information. A sample of the possible actions that an LNS

INTERNET DRAFT   V.92 Modem-On-Hold signalling on L2TP          May 2002


   MAY consider are listed in section 5.  However, the LNS MUST NOT stop
   processing otherwise valid data packets arriving from the LAC,
   regardless of the current state of the modem on-hold indications.

2.1 Capability negotiation

   A LAC MUST NOT send a Modem Status (MDMST) command to an LNS that has
   not indicated the capability of processing such commands.  This
   capability is indicated by adding a "Modem On-Hold Capable" AVP on
   the SCCRQ or SCCRP sent to the LAC when the tunnel is brought up.

2.2 Modem On-Hold

   When the client modem requests the LAC to go on-hold, the LAC SHOULD
   send a MDMST command to the LNS with the H (Hold) bit set to 1 and
   the negotiated maximum on-hold time.

2.3 Modem Online

   When the client modem returns back online after having gone on-hold,
   the LAC SHOULD send a MDMST command to the LNS with the H (Hold) bit
   set to 0.


3. New Commands

   The following commands MUST be sent with the M-bit in the Message
   Type AVP set to 0 to prevent interoperability issues. Messages with
   unknown values in the Message Type AVP with the M-bit set to 0 should
   be ignored by compliant L2TP peers.

3.1 Modem-Status (MDMST)

   The Modem-Status (MDMST) command is a control message used by the LAC
   to notify the LNS when the client modem on-hold status changes.

   The MDMST message MUST NOT be sent to peers that have not included in
   their SCCRQ or SCCRP the Modem On-Hold Capable AVP.

   Furthermore, the MDMST message can only be sent after session
   establishment is successful (i.e., after the LAC has sent either an
   ICCN or an OCCN), and before the session ends from the LAC's point of
   view (i.e., before the LAC has sent or received a CDN).  Note that
   due to protocol race conditions, it is possible for a LAC to send a
   MDMST command about the same time that the LNS is sending a CDN. An
   LNS MUST ignore MDMST commands received after sending a CDN.

INTERNET DRAFT   V.92 Modem-On-Hold signalling on L2TP          May 2002


   There is currently no number assigned to this command by the IANA.  A
   number will be requested if this draft is approved by the L2TP WG.
   Currently, this command is encoded as follows:

      Vendor ID = 529
      Attribute Type = 0 (Message Type AVP)
      Attribute Value = 2 (MDMST)

   The above encoding corresponds to a vendor-specific control message.
   Vendor ID 529 indicates Lucent Technologies, the initial developer of
   this specification.

   The following AVPs MUST be present in the MDMST message:

      Message Type
      Modem On-Hold Status

   The M-bit on the Message Type AVP for this command MUST be set to 0.


4. New Attribute Value Pairs

   The following sections contain a list of the new L2TP AVPs defined in
   this document.

4.1 Modem On-Hold Capable AVP

   The Modem On-Hold Capable AVP indicates that the sender is capable of
   sending or receiving MDMST commands.  This AVP MUST be included on
   the SCCRQ or SCCRP commands to indicate that the sender implements
   this specification.

   It is encoded as Vendor ID 529 with an Attribute Type of 2. The
   Vendor ID 529 indicates Lucent Technologies, the initial developer of
   this specification. It SHOULD be changed to 0 and an official
   Attribute Type chosen if this specification advances on a standards
   track.

   This AVP has no Attribute Value field.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H-bit on the AVP header MAY be 0 or 1).
   The M-bit for this AVP MUST be set to 0.  The Length is 6.

4.2 Modem On-Hold Status AVP

   The Modem On-Hold Status AVP indicates the current on-hold status of
   the client modem. This AVP MUST be present on the MDMST command.

INTERNET DRAFT   V.92 Modem-On-Hold signalling on L2TP          May 2002


   It is encoded as Vendor ID 529 with an Attribute Type of 3. The
   Vendor ID 529 indicates Lucent Technologies, the initial developer of
   this specification. It SHOULD be changed to 0 and an official
   Attribute Type chosen if this specification advances on a standards
   track.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

          0                   1
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |H|      reserved       |Timeout|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Modem On-Hold Status AVP is a 16-bit quantity, containing two
   fields that indicate whether the client modem has gone on-hold and
   the maximum amount of time that the modem is allowed to remain on-
   hold.

   The H field is a single bit that indicates whether the client modem
   has gone on-hold. If the H bit is 1, the client modem is on-hold. If
   the H bit is 0, the client modem is back online.

   The Timeout field is a 4 bits quantity that indicates the negotiated
   maximum amount of time that the client modem can remain on-hold. It
   is only valid if the H bit is 1 and it MUST be ignored if the H bit
   is 0. The value of this field is defined in [V92] and it is
   reproduced here for easy reference:

         Bits   Decimal     Meaning
         ----   -------     -------
         0000      0        Reserved for the ITU

         0010      2        20 seconds
         0011      3        30 seconds
         0100      4        40 seconds

   Bits 1 through 11 are reserved. These bits MUST be set to 0 when
   sending this AVP and MUST be ignored on reception.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H-bit on the AVP header MAY be 0 or 1).
   The M-bit for this AVP MUST be set to 0.  The Length is 8.


5. Sample LNS actions

   The specific actions taken by an LNS upon receipt of a Modem On-Hold
   Status AVP are implementation dependent.  This document does not
   mandate what, if anything, the LNS should do with this information.

   The choice of actions taken by the LNS may have an impact on higher
   layer protocols. For example, TCP connections and other connection-
   oriented applications may timeout or disconnect during the on-hold
   time. The impact that those choices may have on these or other
   protocols is not addressed by this document.

   The following list is a sample of possible actions that an LNS
   implementation might consider. Note that some of these actions are
   not really alternatives, as some of the possibilities preclude
   others.

      * Temporarily stop polling protocols such as LCP Echo Requests,
        Link Quality Monitoring (LQM), Multilink PPP (MP), etc.
      * Drop data packets directed to the now on-hold remote client.
      * Start a new accounting session, to account for the on-hold time.
      * Stop or hold accounting until the modem returns online again.
      * Start a separate time accounting for the time that the modem is
        on hold.

   Here are a few things that an LNS should probably NOT do:

      * Buffer data packets directed to the now on-hold remote client.
        Reason: How many data packets should be buffered? What would be
                the impact on higher layer protocols such as TCP? What
                would be the impact caused by the delay introduced when
                the client returns online again?

      * Answer TCP keepalives in lieu of the client.
        Reason: It may interfere with TCP's recovery once the client
                returns online.

      * Stop processing otherwise valid data packets from the client.
        Reason: There is a race condition between the notification of
                the modem returning online and the first packet from
                the client because they are delivered on independent



Goyret, I.         draft-ietf-l2tpext-v92-moh-00.txt            [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT   V.92 Modem-On-Hold signalling on L2TP          May 2002


                channels. Dropping valid client packets may lead to
                a slower recovery after returning online due to the
                forced retries.


6. IANA Considerations

   The Modem On-Hold Status AVP includes an enumerated value, called
   "Timeout", whose value is defined by ITU in [V92].

   This AVP also contains a set of reserved bits (bits 1 through 11)
   that are assigned by IANA through IETF Consensus [BCP26].


7. Security Considerations

   The integrity and confidentiality of the method described in this
   document relies on the underlying L2TP security mechanisms.  The new
   command and AVPs are intended to indicate when a client modem has
   gone on-hold and cannot receive data.  It does not define what, if
   anything, the LNS should do with this information. A sample of
   possible actions that an LNS may consider are listed in section 5.

   It is believed that the defined extension does not provide
   information that would be useful to an attacker, and as such, it
   should not pose a threat to system security.

   If desired, the new AVPs MAY be hidden as described in section 4.3 of
   [L2TP].
