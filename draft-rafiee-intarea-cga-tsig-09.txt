CGA-TSIG/e: Algorithms for Secure DNS Authentication and DNS 
                        Confidentiality 
                 <draft-rafiee-intarea-cga-tsig-09.txt>

Abstract

   This document describes a new mechanism for secure DNS authentication 
   and DNS data confidentiality. The purpose of this document is to 
   reduce human interaction during different DNS scenarios such as the 
   communications of resolvers to stub resolvers, recursive resolvers to 
   Authoritative Name Server, Dynamic DNS updates, (especially updating 
   PTR and FQDN records (RFC4703)) and zone transfers. This document 
   supports both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled networks.

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014


1.  Introduction 

   Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) [RFC2845] is a protocol that provides 
   endpoint authentication and data integrity through the use of one-way 
   hashing and shared secret keys in order to establish a trust 
   relationship between two or more hosts, which can be either a client 
   and a server, or two servers. The TSIG keys, which are manually 
   exchanged between a group of hosts, must be maintained in a secure 
   manner. This protocol is mostly used today to secure a Dynamic DNS 
   Update, or to assure a Slave Server that the zone transfer is from 
   the original Master Server and that it has not been corrupted. It 
   does this by verifying the signature using a cryptographic key that 
   is shared with the receiver. 

   Handling this shared secret in a secure manner and exchanging it does 
   not appear to be easy. This is especially true if the IP addresses 
   are dynamic or the shared secret is exposed to the attacker. To 
   address these existing problems with TSIG, as well as considering DNS 
   data protection (privacy), and to solve existing problems with the 
   current DNS security extensions, this document proposes two 
   algorithms -- one is for secure authentication that is called 
   CGA-TSIG and one for both secure authentication and DNS data 
   encryption that is called CGA-TSIGe. These algorithms support both 
   IPv4 and IPv6 scenarios. In the IPv6 scenario, the algorithms use 
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] or Secure 
   Simple Addressing Scheme for IPv6 Autoconfiguration (SSAS) as a new 
   algorithm in the TSIG Resource Record (RR). CGA is an important 
   option available in Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971], which 
   provides nodes with the necessary proof of IP address ownership by 
   providing a cryptographic binding between a host's public key and its 
   IP address without the need for the introduction of infrastructure. 
   In IPv4 scenarios, the algorithm uses the hash of public key as an 
   authentication approach. The detail steps for these scenarios are 
   explained in next sections. 

   This document addresses the DNS data confidentiality by using both 
   asymmetric and symmetric cryptography. Asymmetric cryptography is 
   used for encrypting the 16 byte secret key. This secret key then can 
   be used as a key for the symmetric encryption algorithm in order to 
   encrypt the whole DNS message. This process will increase the DNS 
   performance by avoiding the encryption of a large DNS message using a 
   public key cryptography. 

   

   This document updates the following sections in TSIG document: 

   - Section 4.2: The server MUST not generate a signed response to an 
   unsigned request => The server MUST not generate a signed response to 
   an unsigned request, unless the Algorithm Name filed contains 
   CGA-TSIG or CGA-TSIGe.

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   - Section 4.5.2: It MUST include the client's current time in the 
   time signed field, the server's current time (a u_int48_t) in the 
   other data field, and 6 in the other data length field => It MUST 
   include the client's current time in the time signed field, the 
   server's current time (a u_int48_t) in the other data field, and if 
   the Algorithm Name is CGA-TSIG or CGA-TSIGe, then add the length of 
   this client's current time to the total length of Other DATA field. 
   The client's current time in this case will be placed after the 
   CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe Data. 


1.1.  Problem Statement 

   There are several different methods where DNS records can become 
   compromised. Some examples of methods are DNS Spoofing; DNS 
   Amplification Attacks; Resolver Source IP Spoofing; Unauthorized DNS 
   Update; User Privacy Attack; and Human Intervention. 


1.2.  Current Solutions and Requirements 


1.2.1.  Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) 

   Advantages: 

   - Provide a secure level authentication 

   - Signs DNS messages 

   Disadvantages: 

   - Not scalable and applicable for specific scenarios. Currently there 
   is little deployment of TSIG for resolver authentication with 
   clients. One reason is that resolvers respond to anonymous queries 
   and can be located in any part of the network. 

   - Offline exchange of shared secrets. For each group of hosts there 
   needs to be one shared secret and the administrator will need to 
   manually add it to the DNS configuration file for each of these 
   hosts. This manual process will need to be invoked in the case where 
   one of these hosts is compromised and the shared secret is well known 
   to the attacker. It will also have to be invoked in the case where 
   any of these hosts needs to change their IP addresses, such as 
   privacy issues explained in RFC4941 [RFC4941], or when moving 
   networks, etc. The manual TSIG process for the exchange of shared 
   secrets makes it difficult to configure each new client with the 
   shared secret of a DNS server like a resolver. Another problem with 
   TSIG would be when this shared secret is leaked and makes it 
   necessary to repeat this process. 

   - Does not easily protect DNS data confidentiality. TSIG provides the 
   node with transaction level authentication and it is not used for

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   encrypting the content of DNS messages. 


1.2.2.  DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) 

   Advantages: 

   - Signs DNS messages and provide data integrity 

   - Authorize a node to update certain zone file 

   Disadvantages: 

   - Offline generation of the signature 

   DNSSEC [RFC6840] needs manual step for the configuration. For 
   instance, when a DNSSEC needs to sign the zone offline. 

   - IP spoofing 

   The public key verification in DNSSEC creates a chicken-and-egg 
   situation. In other words, the key for verifying messages should be 
   obtained from the DNSSEC server itself. This is why a query requester 
   needs to verify the key. If this does not happen, DNSSEC is 
   vulnerable to an IP spoofing attack. 

   - Does not easily protect DNS data confidentiality for the resolver 
   scenario 

   Since a part of configuration is manual and DNS resolver needs to 
   answer to anonymous queries, it is not possible to exchange the DNS 
   keys with anonymous nodes over the internet. Even though it was 
   possible, there is still no clear solution to encrypt all the data 
   during DNS resolving scenario. 


2.  Conventions Used In This Document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation 
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be 
   interpreted as carrying RFC 2119 significance. 

   => This sign in the document should be interpreted as "change to". 

   IPv6 only: this indicates that the explained approach can be used 
   only in IPv6 scenario 

   IPv4 only: this indicates that the explained approach can be used 
   only in IPv4 scenario

   IPv4 and IPv6: This indicates that the explained approach can be used 
   in both IPv4 and IPv6 scenario and there are no differences. 

   Note: This document uses the names CGA-TSIG and CGA-TSIGe. But it 
   does not mean that the algorithm in use in this document is only CGA. 
   The "CGA" name was taken from the first versions of this draft and 
   continued to be appeared in the latest versions of this draft. This 
   draft also uses TSIG as a carrier protocol to avoid changing the 
   current DNS protocol. 


3.  Terminology 

   The terms used in this document have the following standard meaning: 

   - Bot: a malicious program that is installed on a node and allows an 
   attacker to control some functions of that node to send malicious 
   messages. 

   - Name Server: A server that supports DNS service. 

   - Recursive Name Server: A Name Server that responds to all queries. 

   - Stub Resolver: A DNS resolver that is unable to resolve queries 
   recursively, and relies on a Recursive DNS Server to resolve queries. 

   - Authoritative Name Server: Provides answers to DNS queries that it 
   contains in its system configuration. 

   There are two types of Authoritative Name Servers: 

   1.	Master Server (Primary): A Master Server stores the original 
   copies of all zone records. Each Slave Server gets updated via a 
   special automatic updating mechanism within the DNS protocol. All 
   Slave Servers maintain identical copies of the master records. 

   2.	Slave Server (Secondary): A Slave Server is an exact replica of 
   the master server. 

   - Root Name Server: An Authoritative Name Server for the root domain 
   (i.e., '.' (dot)) 

   - Client: a client can be any computer (server, laptop, etc) that 
   only supports stub DNS servers and not other DNS services. It can be 
   a mail server, web server or a laptop computer. 

   - Node: a node can be anything such as a client, a DNS server 
   (resolver, authoritative) or a router. 

   - Host: all nodes except routers

4.  Algorithm Overview 

   The following sections explain the CGA-TSIG data structure in IPv4 
   and IPv6 scenarios. A CGA-TSIG data structure is an option to the 
   TSIG Resource Record (RR). 


4.1.  CGA-TSIG 


4.1.1.  The CGA-TSIG DATA Structure  

   The CGA-TSIG data structure SHOULD be added to the Other DATA section 
   of the RDATA field in the TSIG Resource Record (RR) (see figures 1 
   and 2). The DNS RRTYPE MUST be set to TSIG [RFC2845]. The RDATA 
   Algorithm Name MUST be set to CGA-TSIG. The CGA-TSIG name is used 
   when there is no need for DNS data confidentiality. The CGA-TSIGe 
   (Please refer to section 4.2) is used when all parts of a DNS message 
   should be encrypted to provide data confidentiality. The Name MUST be 
   set to root (.). This is the smallest possible value that can be 
   used. The MAC Size MUST be set to 0 when the Algorithm Name is 
   CGA-TSIG. 

   A detailed explanation of the standard RDATA fields can be found in 
   section 2.3 [RFC2845]. This document focuses only on the new 
   structure added to the Other DATA section. These new fields are 
   CGA-TSIG Len and CGA-TSIG DATA. The TSIG RR is added to an additional 
   section of the DNS message.

   (same format as public key)
   Old Signature Len     variable    Length of old signature field
   Old Signature         variable    Old signature generated by old
   public key.
   
   The IP Tag is one of the old IP addresses of the Node. A client's 
   public key can be associated with several IP addresses on a server. 
   The DNS server SHOULD store the IP addresses and the public keys to 
   indicate their association. If a client wants to add RRs by using a 
   new IP address, then the IP tag field will be zeroed out. The server 
   will then store the new IP address that was passed to it in storage. 
   If the client wants to replace an existing IP address in a DNS Server 
   with a new one, then the IP Tag field will be populated with the IP 
   address which is to be replaced. The DNS server will then look for

   the IP address referenced by the IP tag stored and replace it with 
   the new one. This enables the client to update his own RRs using 
   multiple IP addresses while, at the same time, giving him the ability 
   to change IP addresses. If a Node changes its public key, then it 
   MUST add the old public key to the Old Pubkey field. It MUST also 
   retrieve the current time from the Time Signed field, sign it using 
   the old private key, and then add the signature to the old signature 
   field. This enables the verifier node to authenticate a host with a 
   new public key. The verification steps are explained in detail in 
   sections 5.1.1, 5.2.1 and 5.3.1. 


4.1.2.1.  IPv6 Specific Data 

   For IPv6, the Type field indicates the Interface ID generation 
   algorithm that is used in SeND (An Interface ID is the 64 rightmost 
   bits of an IPv6 address). The field allows for future development. 
   The default value for CGA is 1. IP Tag for IPv6 is 16 octets. 


4.1.2.2.  IPv4 Specific Data 

   For IPv4, the Type field indicates the hashing function used to 
   generate the hash of (public key + IPv4). By default, it is SHA256. 
   This value SHOULD be set to 1 for SHA256 and other numeric 
   incremental value for other SHA algorithms. This allows for future 
   hashing functions. 


4.1.3.  Generation of CGA-TSIG DATA  

   In order to use CGA-TSIG as an authentication approach, some of the 
   parameters need to be cached during IP address generation. If no 
   parameters are available in the cache, please see section 6. 

   1. Obtain Require Parameters From Cache. 

   For IPv6, if the Type Field above is CGA, then the parameters that 
   SHOULD be cached are the modifier, algorithm type, location of the 
   public/private keys and the IP addresses of the host. For IPv4, the 
   location to the key pairs need to be cached in order to generate the 
   signature. If this node changes its IP address, it also needs to 
   cache the old IP address. 

   Note: If the node is a DNS server (resolver or Authoritative Name 
   Server) that does not support SeND but wants to use the CGA-TSIG 
   algorithm, a script can be used to generate the CGA parameters. 
   (Please refer to the section 10.2. appendix) 

   2. Generate Signature 

   The 128-bit CGA Message Type tag value for SeND is 0x086F CA5E 10B2 
   00C9 9C8C E001 6427 7C08. This value is concatenated with the entire

   DNS message (Please refer to figure 3 and figure 4) and the private 
   key obtained from the cache. This signature MUST be added to the 
   signature field of the CGA-TSIG DATA record. The Time Signed field 
   uses the same timestamp in RDATA. This will prevent replay attacks by 
   changing the signature each time a Node sends a DNS message. The 
   format of DNS messages is explained in section 4.1.3 [RFC1035]. 

   3. Generate Old Signature 

   If the Nodes generated new key pairs, they need to add the old public 
   key, signed by the old private key, to the CGA-TSIG DATA. A Node will 
   sign the new public key with the old private key, and then will add 
   the contents of this signature to the old signature field of CGA-TSIG 
   DATA. This step MUST be skipped when the Node did not generate new 
   key pairs.

4.2.  CGA-TSIGe 

   One possible solution to provide the DNS server with data 
   confidentiality during DNS update or other DNS query processes is the 
   use of symmetric encryption with CGA-TSIG that is called CGA-TSIGe. 


4.2.1.  The CGA-TSIGe DATA Structure  

   The Node MUST set the Algorithm Type in TSIG RDATA to CGA-TSIGe. 
   Other sections of CGA-TSIGe DATA are similar to CGA-TSIG DATA. This 
   section only explains the differences between CGA-TSIG and CGA-TSIGe. 
   Figure 5 shows CGA-TSIGe DATA structure. The value of Message Hash is 
   the concatenation of the 3 bits hashing algorithm identifier with the 
   hash of the whole DNS message (see figure 3 and 4 for the whole DNS 
   message). This is used for data integrity of the packet. For SHA256, 
   the value of hashing algorithm SHOULD set to 1. For other hashing 
   algorithms, this 3 bits SHOULD set to sequential value after one. The 
   field Message Hash Len is the length of Message Hash.

   Figure 5 CGA-TSIGe DATA Field

4.2.1.1.  Public Key Request 

   In the TSIG RDATA section, the Algorithm Name MUST be set to 
   'CGA-TSIGe', and the CGA-TSIGe Len field MUST be set to zero. This 
   alerts the DNS server that the other Node needs its public key for 
   encryption purposes. This format is used if a Node does not want to 
   use DNSKEY RR [RFC3757] to retrieve the public key of the DNS server. 


4.2.1.2.  Public Key Response 

   The DATA structure is similar to CGA-TSIG. There is only a flag field 
   which indicates that it is a response to the public key request 
   message.

   Figure 6 CGA-TSIGe DATA Field (public key response)

4.2.2.  Generation of CGA-TSIGe DATA  


4.2.2.1.  IPv6 Specifics 

   Nodes can securely obtain the IP address of DNS resolvers from the 
   DHCPv6 server (use SAVI-DHCP [savi-dhcp]); or from a DNS option of 
   Router Advertisement message [RFC6106] after authenticating with the 
   router via a trusted authority. The IP addresses can be generated 
   using CGA, SSAS or other mechanisms. (tjw:Last Sentence) 

   This is the same approach that a Node can use for obtaining a DNS 
   server IP address during a Dynamic DNS update. However, for a zone 
   transfer to avoid any malicious update to DNS server, it is 
   RECOMMENDED that this IP address is set manually on the DNS server 
   for the first time. 

   1. Retrieve Public Key of DNS Server 

   To encrypt the DNS message using a symmetric algorithm for 
   performance purposes, first, a Node needs to retrieve the public key 
   of the DNS server. It is possible to use the current DNSKEY RR 
   [RFC3757] to send the public key of the DNS server. When the client 
   wants to update any records on the DNS server, it first sends a DNS 
   message asking for the public key of the DNS Server. The DNS Server 
   then answers this query and includes the public key contained in the 
   DNSKEY RR with the SEP flag set to zero (0). This indicates that it 
   is not the zone key. It is also possible to use the RR format 
   explained in sections 4.2.1.1 and 4.2.1.2 of this document. The DNS 
   server SHOULD include CGA-TSIGe DATA so that the client can verify 
   its IP address. In this case, there will be a binding between a DNS 
   Server's public key and its IP address. If the Node can verify the 
   DNS Server public key (explained below), it goes to step 2. Otherwise 
   it discards the DNS message without further action. 

   2. Obtain Required Parameters From Cache. 

   This step is the same as what is explained in section 4.1.3. 

   3. Generation of Secret Key 

   After a successful verification, the Node generates a 16 byte random 
   number called a secret key. The Node can use any algorithm explained 
   in [RFC4086] to generate a good randomized value. It encrypts the 
   secret key using the DNS Server public key. Then, the Node sets the 
   MAC in TSIG RDATA to the digest of secret key and set the MAC Size to 
   the length of this digest. The DNS Server knows what to do with MAC 
   field from the Algorithm Type in TSIG. If it is CGA-TSIGe, then it 
   looks for this encrypted secret key.

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   4. Encryption of DNS message 

   The Node uses the secret key generated in the previous step to 
   encrypt the header, zone section, prerequisite, and update section 
   for the DNS update message (see figure7) or encrypt header, question, 
   answer, authority of a DNS Query (see figure 8). It then calculates 
   the length of a digest as a number of bytes in multiples of 8. For 
   example, if the digest is 242 bytes then 242 = (30 * 8) + 2. 
   Therefore, 6 bytes are added as padding, and then 31 is placed at the 
   beginning of digest (see figure 9). If there is no padding for the 
   digest then one zero-filled byte will be added at the end of digest. 
   This allows the DNS Server to interpret this digest as a long string.

   The Node then adds a new header with the following sample data. This

   will allow the DNS Server to process this message. CGA-TSIGe actually 
   uses the whole encrypted section as one single question followed by 
   additional data.

   NSCOUNT           0x0000 No records follow
   ARCOUNT           0x0001 No additional records follow
   The digest will be interpreted like the following table.

   0x1f       String of length 248 follows
   0x777777.. String is xxxxxx
   0x00       End of this string
   5. Generation of Message Hash 

   In a case where a DNS Server responds to anonymous queries, as in a 
   DNS Resolver scenario, the Node executes SHA256 by default on the 
   whole DNS message. This includes the additional section and the TSIG 
   RR as a part of additional section of DNS message. It then computes 
   the Message Hash Len. In this case the message does not need to be 
   signed by the Node using its private key. This is because the DNS 
   Server does not expect to verify the Node and it only checks for the 
   message integrity and confidentiality. In the case a message contains 
   Message Hash, the Node MUST set the Parameters Len , Signature Len, 
   Old Pubkey Len and Old Signature Len to zero (0) and it SHOULD skips 
   steps 6 and 7. 

   6. Generation of Signature 

   This step is the same as what is explained in section 4.1.3. 

   7. Generation of Old Signature 

   This step is the same as what is explained in section 4.1.3. 


4.2.2.2.  IPv4 Scenario 

   The key pairs needs to be cached in order to generate a signature. If 
   this Node changes its IP address, it also needs to cache the old IP

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   address. Similar to the IPv6 scenario, the Node can obtain the hash 
   of (public key + IPv4) and the IPv4 address of the DNS server from a 
   DHCPv4 server. It can use [savi-dhcp]. If this Node is in unsecured 
   environment, it can manually add the hash of (public key + IPv4 
   address) of its trusted DNS server. This is especially true in the 
   Resolver scenario. The implementers SHOULD define a possibility for 
   users to change the default value for CGA-TSIGe. 

   1. Retrieves Public Key of DNS server 

   This is similar to IPv6 scenario. 

   2. Obtain Required Parameters From Cache. 

   This step is the same as what is explained in section 4.1.3. 

   3. Generation of Secret Key 

   4. Encryption of DNS Message 

   5. Generation of Message Hash 

   All Three are similar to IPv6 scenario. 

   6. Generation of Signature 

   This step is the same as what is explained in section 4.1.3. 

   7. Generation of Old Signature 

   This step is the same as what is explained in section 4.1.3. 


4.2.3.  Process of Public Key Response Message 

   This section explains the verification needed for the process of 
   public key response (The format of this message was explained in 
   section 4.2.1.2) 


4.2.3.1.  IPv6 only Scenarios 

   Depends on the algorithm used by the DNS server, CGA or SSAS 
   verification process MUST be executed. 


4.2.3.2.  IPv4 only Scenarios 

   The verifier node MUST execute hashing function on (public key + IPv4 
   address) and compare this value with the value exists on its cache or 
   the value retrieved from a DNS server in a secure manner.

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

4.2.4.  Process of Encrypted DNS Message 

   When the DNS server receives the message from any node with TSIG 
   RDATA Algorithm type set to CGA-TSIGe, it executes the following 
   steps: 

   1- Retrieves The Secret Key 

   The DNS server retrieves the secret key from MAC field. It then 
   decrypts this secret key using its own private key. 

   2- Decrypts the DNS Message 

   The DNS server decrypts the DNS server message using this secret key 
   and the symmetric algorithm, which by default is AES. The DNS server 
   can then start the verification process explained in the next 
   section. 


5.  CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe Use Case Scenarios 


5.1.  DNS Zone Transfer 

   This section discusses the use of CGA-TSIGe for the secure 
   authentication and encryption of DNS messages exchanged between a 
   Master Server and a Slave Server. In the case of processing a DNS 
   zone update ([AI]XFR) for multiple DNS servers (authenticating two 
   DNS servers), there are three possible scenarios with regard to the 
   authentication process which differs from that of the authentication 
   of a Node (client) with one DNS server. This is needed for human 
   intervention. Since the zone contains important information, both DNS 
   servers MUST use CGA-TSIGe and encrypt the values. The only exception 
   is when CGA-TSIG is required for secure authentication and the data 
   encryption is handled by other protocols. 

   a. Add The DNS servers' IP address To A Slave Server Configuration 
   (IPv6 only) 

   A DNS server administrator should only manually add the IP address of 
   the Master Server to the configuration file of the Slave Server. When 
   the DNS update message is processed, the Slave Server can 
   authenticate the Master Server based on the source IP address and 
   then, prove the ownership of this address by use of the CGA-TSIGe 
   option from the TSIG RR. This scenario will be valid until the IP 
   address in any of these DNS servers, changes. 

   To automate this process, the sender's public key of the DNS Update 
   message must be saved on the other DNS server, after the source IP 
   address has been successfully verified for the first time. In this 
   case, when the sender generates a new IP address by executing the CGA 
   algorithm using the same public key, the other DNS server can still 
   verify it and add its new IP address to the DNS configuration file

   automatically. 

   b. Retrieve Public/Private Keys From A Third Party Trusted Authority 
   (TA) (IPv6 only) 

   The message exchange option of SeND [RFC3971] may be used for the 
   retrieval of third party certificates. This may be done automatically 
   from the TA by using the Certificate Path Solicitation and 
   Certificate Path Advertisement messages. Like in section 5.2, the 
   certificate should be saved on the DNS server for later use. Whenever 
   any of those servers want to generate a new IP address, the DNS 
   update process can be accomplished without human intervention. 

   c. Store The Hash of (public key + IPv4 address) to DNS configuration 
   file (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   An administrator needs to manually generate the hash of the 
   concatenation of public key with the IPv4 address of the authorized 
   node the DNS configuration file. Whenever a node wants to change its 
   IP address or public key, the DNS server can generates this value 
   automatically and compare with the old value it has and then after a 
   successful verification steps (it will be explain in next section), 
   it will replace the old hash value with the new one. 


5.1.1.  Verification Process 

   Sender authentication is necessary in order to prevent attackers from 
   making unauthorized modifications to DNS servers through the use of 
   spoofed DNS messages. The verification process uses the following 
   steps: 

   1. Verify The Signature (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   The Signature contained in CGA-TSIGe DATA should be verified. This 
   can be done by retrieving the public key and signature from CGA-TSIGe 
   DATA and using this public key to verify the signature. If the 
   verification process is successful, then execute step 2. Otherwise, 
   the message should be discarded. 

   2. Check The Time Signed (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   The Time Signed value is obtained from TSIG RDATA and is called t(1). 
   The current system time is then obtained and converted to UTC time 
   and is called t(2). Fudge time is obtained from TSIG RDATA and is 
   called t(fudge). If t(1) is in the range of t(2) and t(2) minus/plus 
   t(Fudge) (see formula 1), then step 3 will be executed. Otherwise, 
   the message will be considered spoofed and discarded. The range is 
   used in consideration of the delays that can occur during its 
   transmission over TCP or UDP. Both times must use UTC time in order 
   to avoid differences in time based on different geographical 
   locations.

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   (t(1) - t(fudge)) <= t(2) <=(t(1) + t(fudge)) 

   Formula: (1) 

   3. Execute The CGA Verification (IPv6 only) 

   These steps are in section 5 of [RFC3972]. If the sender of the DNS 
   message uses another algorithm, instead of CGA, then this step 
   becomes the verification step for that algorithm. If the verification 
   process is successful, then step 6 will be executed. Otherwise the 
   message will be discarded without further action. 

   4. Generate The Hash of (public key + IP address) (IPv4 only) 

   The DNS server retrieves the hashing Algorithm Type from the 
   CGA-TSIGe DATA structure. It then concatenates the Public Key with 
   the IP address of the update requester and executes the SHA256 
   algorithm (by default) or another algorithm identified in Type 
   section of CGA-TSIG DATA RRTYPE. It then compares it with the hash 
   value available in the DNS configuration. If they are the same, the 
   Update Message should be processed, otherwise, go to step 5. 

   5. Generate The Hash of (Old Public Key + IPv4 Address) (IPv4 only) 

   If the Old Public Key Length is zero, then skip this step and discard 
   the DNS update message. If the Old Public Key Length is not zero, 
   then the DNS server retrieves the hashing algorithm Type from the 
   CGA-TSIGe DATA structure. It then concatenates Old Public Key with 
   the IP address of the update requester and execute the SHA256 
   algorithm (by default) or another algorithm identified in Type 
   section of CGA-TSIGe DATA. It then compares it with the hash value 
   available in the DNS configuration. If they are the same, the Update 
   Message should be processed, otherwise, go to step 8. 

   6. Verify The Source IP Address (IPv6 only) 

   The source IP Address of the Update requester MUST be checked against 
   the one contained in the DNS configuration. If they are the same, the 
   Update Message should be processed, otherwise, proceed to step 7. 

   7. Verify The Public Key (IPv6 only) 

   The DNS server checks whether or not the public key retrieved from 
   CGA-TSIGe DATA is the same as what is available in the cache where 
   the public keys and IP addresses are saved. If this Public Key is not 
   found in the cache, then the update will be rejected. Otherwise, when 
   the Old Public Key Length is not zero go to step 8. 

   8. Verify The Old Public Key (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   If the Old Public Key Length is zero, skip this step and discard the 
   DNS update message. If the Old Public Key Length is not zero, then 
   the DNS server will retrieve the Old Public Key from CGA-TSIGe DATA

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   and check to see if it is the same as what was saved in the DNS 
   server's cache. If they are the same, execute step 6, otherwise 
   discard the message. 

   7. Verify The Old Signature (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   The Old Signature contained in CGA-TSIGe DATA should be verified. 
   This can be done by retrieving the Old Public Key and the Old 
   Signature from CGA-TSIGe DATA and then using this Old Public Key to 
   verify the Old Signature. If the verification is successful, the 
   Update Message should be processed and the New Public Key should be 
   replaced with the Old Public Key in the DNS server. If the 
   verification process fails, discard the message. 


5.2.  The FQDN Or PTR Update (IPv6 only) 

   Normally the DHCPv6 server will update the client's RRs on their 
   behalf in the scenario where SeND is used as a secure NDP, the Nodes 
   will need to do this process unless a stateless DHCPv6 server is 
   available. CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe can be used to give Nodes the ability 
   of doing this process themselves. In this case the clients need to 
   include the CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe option to allow the DNS server to 
   verify them. The verification process is the same as that explained 
   in the next section except for step 4. 


5.2.1.  Verification Process 

   The verification steps are the same as those is explained in section 
   5.1.1, but removing step 4 and modifying step 5. 

   1. Verify The Signature 

   2. Check The Time Signed 

   3. Execute The CGA Verification 

   4. Verify The Public Key 

   The DNS server checks if the public key retrieved from 
   CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe DATA is the same as what was available in cache. 
   If no entry is found for this public key, and the FQDN or PTR is also 
   not available in the DNS server, then the DNS server will store the 
   public key of this Node and add this Node's PTR and FQDN. Otherwise 
   if any PTR is available, and the Node IP tag is empty, or there is 
   currently another public key associated with the Node's FQDN, then 
   the update will be skipped. Otherwise, if the Old Public Key Length 
   is not zero, go to step 5. 

   5. Verify The Public Key 

   6. Verify The Old Public Key

   7. Verify The Old Signature 


5.3.  DNS Resolving Scenario (stub to recursive) 

   A DNS query request sent by a host, such as a client or a mail 
   server, does not need to generate CGA-TSIG DATA because the resolver 
   responds to anonymous queries. The Resolver's response SHOULD contain 
   the CGA-TSIG DATA field in order to verify him. However, the client 
   needs to include the TSIG RDATA and set the Algorithm Type to 
   CGA-TSIG, and it MUST set the CGA-TSIG Len to zero (0). This allows 
   the resolver to include CGA-TSIG in the client. 

   If the Node needs to deploy DNS data confidentiality, then it needs 
   to set the Algorithm Type to CGA-TSIGe and follows the step explained 
   in section 4.2.2. In this particular scenario, the Node MUST set 
   Message Hash in CGA-TSIGe. This allows the DNS server to ensure data 
   integrity without going to the process of message decryption. 

   In the generation of the CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe for a Resolver, there is 
   no need to include the IP Tag. This is because the Resolvers do not 
   usually have several IP addresses so the client does not need to keep 
   several IP addresses for the same resolver.

   Figure 10. DNS resolving scenario using CGA-TSIGe

5.3.1.  Client Verification Process (CGA-TSIGe only) 

   1. Retrieves Hashing Algorithm From CGA-TSIGe 

   The resolver retrieves the hashing algorithm from CGA-TSIGe Type 
   field. 

   2. Executes Hashing Algorithm on DNS Message 

   The Resolver computes the SHA algorithm on the whole DNS message. It 
   compares this with the value obtained from Message Hash of CGA-TSIGe. 
   If they are the same, it decrypts the message using the shared secret 
   obtained from the MAC section of the Other DATA section of TSIG 
   RRType. 


5.3.2.  Resolver Verification Process 

   When a Resolver responds to the client's query request for the first 
   time, the client saves its Public Key in a file. This allows the 
   client to verify this Resolver when it changes its IP Address due to 
   privacy or security concerns. The steps 2 and 3 of the verification 
   process are the same as those steps explained in section 5.1.1. These 
   steps are as follows: 

   1. Verify The Hash of Public Key (IPv4 only) 

   The client retrieves the SHA Algorithm Type from the Type section of 
   CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe, concatenates the Resolver's Public Key with the 
   Resolver's IP address, and computes the SHA algorithm on the result. 
   The client compares this value with the value in its cache (received 
   securely from a DHCP server or manually set by client). If they are 
   the same, it stores its Public Key in its cache, and continues onto 
   the next step. Otherwise the message will be discarded. 

   2. Verify The Signature (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   The Signature contained in CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe DATA can be verified by 
   retrieving the Public Key and Signature from the CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe 
   DATA. If the verification process is successful, continue onto step 
   3, otherwise the message will be discarded. 

   3. Check The Time Signed (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   4. Execute The CGA Verification (IPv6 only)

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014


   5. Verify The Source IP Address (IPv6 only) 

   If the Resolver's source IP address is the same as that which is 
   known for the host or the length of Old Public Key is not zero (0), 
   then step 6 will be executed. Otherwise the message SHOULD be 
   discarded without further action. 

   6. Verify The Public Key (IPv6 only) 

   The client checks whether or not the Public Key retrieved from 
   CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe DATA matches any Public Key that was previously 
   saved in the storage where the Public Key and IP addresses of 
   Resolvers are saved. If there is a match, then the message is 
   processed. If not, then step 7 will be executed. 

   7. Verify The Old Public Key (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   If the Old Public Key Length is zero (0), discard this message 
   without further action. If the Old Public Key Length is not zero(0), 
   then the host will retrieve the Old Public Key from 
   CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe DATA and will check whether or not it is the same 
   as what was saved in the host's storage where the Public Keys and IP 
   addresses are stored. If it is the same, then step 8 will be 
   executed. 

   8. Verify The Old Signature (IPv4 and IPv6) 

   The Old Signature contained in CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe DATA can be 
   verified by retrieving the Old Public Key and Old Signature from 
   CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe DATA and then using this Old Public Key to verify 
   the Old Signature. If the verification is successful, the DNS Message 
   should be processed and the New Public Key should be replaced with 
   the Old Public Key of the Resolver in the host. If the verification 
   process fails, then the message will be discarded. 


5.4.  DNS Resolving Scenario (Authoritative NS to Recursive NS) 

   This verification step of Authoritative Name Server to Recursive Name 
   Server is the same as that explained in section 5.3.1. In this case 
   the Recursive Name Server does not need to generate CGA-TSIG DATA, 
   but the Root Name Server does need to include it in order to enable 
   the Recursive Name Server to verify it. The Recursive Name Server 
   needs to include the TSIG RDATA and set the Algorithm Type to 
   CGA-TSIG. It MUST set the CGA-TSIG Len to zero (0). This allows the 
   Root Name Server to know when to include CGA-TSIG for verification 
   process in client. 

   In case the node needs to use DNS data confidentiality, then it needs 
   to set the Algorithm Type to CGA-TSIGe and follows the step explained 
   in section 4.2.2. In this particular scenario, the Node MUST set the 
   Message Hash in CGA-TSIGe. This allows the DNS server to ensure the 


Rafiee, et al.      Expires January 4, 2015                    [Page 24]

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   data integrity of this message without going to the process of 
   message decryption. 


6.  SeND Is Not Supported (IPv6 only) 

   In the case where there are no cache parameters available during the 
   IP Address generation, there are then two scenarios that come into 
   play here. In the first scenario there is the case where the sender 
   of a DNS message needs to generate a key pair and generate the 
   CGA-TSIG or CGA-TSIGe data structure as explained in section 4.1 or 
   section 4.2. The Node SHOULD skip the first section of the 
   verification processes explained in section 5.1.1, section 5.2.1, and 
   section 5.3.1. 

   In the second scenario, as explained in section 4.1.3 (step 1), it is 
   not necessary for the server to support the SeND or CGA algorithm. 
   The DNS administrator can make a one-time use of a CGA script to 
   generate the CGA parameters and then manually configure the IP 
   address of the DNS server. Later, the DNS server can use those values 
   as a means for authenticating other Nodes. The verifier Nodes also do 
   not necessarily need to support SeND. They only need to support 
   CGA-TSIG. 

   In the third scenario, as explained in section 4.1.4, the Node can 
   use the same approach used for IPv4 and retrieve the hash of (Public 
   Key + IPv6 Address) from the DHCPv6 server. 


7.  CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe Sample Applications 

   The purpose of CGA-TSIG and CGA-TSIGe is to minimize the human 
   intervention required to accomplish a shared secret or key exchange, 
   with the end result of providing data confidentiality to prevent DNS 
   spoofing. Minimizing the amount of human intervention reduces the 
   vulnerability to attacks introduced by human errors. 

   As explained above, CGA-TSIG and CGA-TSIGe can be used in different 
   scenarios. For the FQDN update scenario, CGA-TSIG is useful in 
   dynamic networks where the nodes want to change their IP addresses 
   frequently in order to maintain privacy. If the Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is in use, then the DHCP server can do 
   this update on behalf of the nodes in this network on a DNS server. 
   But with the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), there is no feature 
   available that allows the host security update process for its own 
   FQDN. In this case, CGA-TSIG can be a solution. 

   In the Resolver scenario, the Resolver can add the TSIG Resource 
   Record (RR) to the DNS query response and use the CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe 
   algorithm to authenticate the result or DNS data protection. CGA-TSIG 
   assures the client that the query response comes from the true 
   originator and not from an attacker. CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe also ensures 
   the integrity/and confidentiality of the data by signing and 


Rafiee, et al.      Expires January 4, 2015                    [Page 25]

INTERNET DRAFT             New algorithms in TSIG           July 4, 2014

   encrypting the data. 

   There are several types of attacks that CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe can 
   prevent. The use of CGA-TSIG will reduce the number of messages 
   needed between a client and a server in order to establish a secure 
   channel. To exchange the shared secret between a DNS Resolver and a 
   client, when TSIG is used, a minimum of four (4) messages are 
   required. By modifying [RFC2845] to use CGA-TSIG, this will decrease 
   the number of messages needed . The messages used in [RFC2930] (TKEY 
   RR) are not needed when CGA-TSIG is used. 


7.1.  IP Spoofing  

   This prevents the attack by finding a binding between the IP address 
   and the Public Key for both IPv4 and IPv6 , with different 
   approaches. 


7.2.  Resolver Configuration Attack 

   When using CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe, the DNS server (or client), would not 
   need further configuration. This reduces the possibility of human 
   errors being introduced into the DNS configurations. Since this type 
   of attack is predicated on human error, the chances of it occurring 
   are minimized. 


7.3.  Exposing A Shared Secret 

   Using CGA-TSIG/CGA-TSIGe will decrease the number of manual steps 
   required in generating the new shared secret and in exchanging it 
   among the hosts to update the old shared secret. This manual step is 
   required after a shared secret is leaked. 


7.4.  Replay Attack  

   Using the Time Signed value in the Signature modifies the content of 
   the Signature each time the Node generates and sends it to the DNS 
   server. If the attacker attempts to spoof the timestamp, the DNS 
   server will check this message by verifying the signature. In this 
   case, the verification process will fail preventing the replay 
   attack. 


7.5.  Data Confidentiality 

   Encrypting the whole DNS message will deny the attacker from knowing 
   the content of DNS messages. This will avoid zone walking and many 
   other attacks on DNS RRs. 

8.  Security Considerations

   The approach explained in this draft, CGA-TSIG, is a solution for 
   securing DNS messages from spoofing type attacks like those explained 
   in section 3. 

   A problem that may arise here concerns attacks against the CGA 
   algorithm. In this section we will explain the possibility of such 
   attacks against CGA [5] and explain the available solutions that we 
   considered in this draft. 

   a) Discover an Alternative Key Pair Hashing of the Victim's Node 
   Address 

   In this case an attacker would have to find an alternate key pair 
   hashing of the victim's address. The probability for success of this 
   type of attack will rely on the security properties of the underlying 
   hash function, i.e., an attacker will need to break the second 
   pre-image resistance of that hash function. The attacker will perform 
   a second pre-image attack on a specific address in order to match 
   other CGA parameters using Hash1 and Hash2. The cost of doing this is 
   (2^59+1) * 2^(16*1). If the user uses a sufficient security level, it 
   will be not feasible for an attacker to carry out this type of attack 
   due to the cost involved. Changing the IP address frequently will 
   also decrease the chance for this type of attack succeeding. 

   b) DoS to Kill a CGA Node 

   Sending a valid or invalid CGA signed message with high frequency 
   across the network can keep the destination node(s) busy with the 
   verification process. This type of DoS attack is not specific to CGA, 
   but it can be applied to any request-response protocol. One possible 
   solution ,to mitigate this attack, is to add a controller to the 
   verifier side of the process to determine how many messages a node 
   has received over a certain period of time from a specific node. If a 
   determined threshold rate is exceeded, then the node will stop 
   further receipt of incoming messages from that node. 

   c) CGA Privacy Implication 

   Due to the high computational complexity necessary for the creation 
   of a CGA, it is likely that once a node generates an acceptable CGA 
   it will continue its use at that subnet. The result is that nodes 
   using CGAs are still susceptible to privacy related attacks. One 
   solution to these types of attacks is setting a lifetime for the 
   address as explained in RFC 4941. 



9.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allowed for choosing new algorithm(s) for use in the 
   TSIG Algorithm name. Algorithm name refers to the algorithm described 
   in this document. The requirement to have this name registered with

   IANA is specified. 

   In section 4.1, Type should allow for the use of future optional 
   algorithms with regard to SeND. The default value for CGA might be 1. 
   Other algorithms would be assigned a new number sequentially. For 
   example, a new algorithm called SSAS [4,5] could be assigned a value 
   of 2. 

   IANA also needs to define a numeric algorithm number for ECC. The 
   similar way that is defined for RSA.

10.1.  A Sample Key Storage For CGA-TSIG 

   create table cgatsigkeys (
   id		INT auto_increment,
   pubkey	VARCHAR(300),
   primary key(id)
   );
   create table cgatsigips (
   id		INT auto_increment,
   idkey	INT,
   IP		VARCHAR(20),
   FOREIGN KEY (idkey) REFERENCES cgatsigkeys(id)
   primary key(id)
   );

10.2.  Stored parameters in the node 

   Here is a sample format of stored parameters in the node. For 
   example, the modifier is stored as bytes and each byte might be 
   separated by a comma (for example : 284,25,14,...). Algorithmtype is 
   the algorithm used in signing the message. Zero is the default 
   algorithm for RSA. Secval is the CGA Sec value that is, by default, 
   one. GIP is the global IP address of this node (for example: 
   2001:abc:def:1234:567:89a). oGIP is the old IP address of this node, 
   before the generation of the new IP address. Keys contains the path 
   where the CGA-TSIG algorithm can find the PEM format used for the 
   public/private keys (for example: /home/myuser/keys.pem ).
