Internet-Draft     Mail Enhanced Status Code Registry         March 2007


1.  Introduction

   Enhanced Status Codes for SMTP were first defined in [1], which was
   replaced by [2].  Since that time, various RFCs have been published
   and internet drafts proposed that define further status codes.
   However, no IANA registry was defined for the status codes and
   conflicts in definitions have begun to appear.  This RFC defines such
   an IANA registry and was written to help prevent further conflicts
   from appearing in the future.

   This document is being discussed on the SMTP mailing list,
   ietf-smtp@imc.org [6].


2.  IANA Considerations

   o  IANA is directed to create the registry Mail Enhanced Status
      Codes.  In the terms of [5], values of Enhanced Status Codes must
      be registered with IANA under the IETF Consensus method.
   o  The Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry will have three tables:
      *  class sub-code,
      *  subject sub-code, and
      *  enumerated status codes, which include both a subject sub-code
         and a detail sub-code.
   o  Each entry in the tables will include: the sub-code or enumerated
      status code, a definition title for the code, and a description of
      the code's use, similar to the entries shown in [2].  An example
      of an entry in the enumerated status code table would be:
      X.0.0  Other undefined Status
         Other undefined status is the only undefined error code.  It
         should be used for all errors for which only the class of the
         error is known.
   o  The initial values for the class and subject sub-code tables is to
      be populated from section 2 of [2].
   o  The initial values for the enumerated status code table is to be
      populated from sections 3.1 through 3.8 of [2], section 3.3.4 of
      [3], and section 5 of [4].


3.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
