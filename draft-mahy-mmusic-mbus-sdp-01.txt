Abstract

   Mbus (Message Bus for Local Coordination) was designed for use on
   individual hosts, subnets, or small multicast networks.  This
   document describes how to setup an Mbus control session using SIP and
   SDP.  Using SIP to setup Mbus allows for authentication, negotiation
   of an Mbus secret key, and facilitates NAT and firewall traversal.

1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

2.  Introduction

   Mbus (Message Bus for Local Coordination) - RFC 3259 [4], is a
   lightweight message-oriented coordination protocol designed for
   inter-application communication.  Mbus was designed to run primarily
   over IP multicast, but also runs over unicast UDP datagrams.
   Although Mbus contains built-in message integrity and encryption
   capabilities, it assumes a shared secret key and has no
   authentication mechanism.  In addition, as MBus expects to use either
   multicast, local service discovery, or manual configuration to find
   other Mbus devices, it does not function well over NATs [7]
   (including v4/v6 translators).

   This document describes how to setup an end-to-end, unicast, Mbus
   control stream using SIP [1] and SDP [3].  Using SIP allows MBus to
   be used in settings which are geographically local, but not
   topologically local.  (For example, a mobile phone with IP
   connectivity could be used as a remote control for a SIP-based video
   conferencing system which happens to be in the same room, but are in
   very different networks and addressing realms).

3.  Requirements

   The Mbus profiles likely to be used in conjunction with SIP require
   strong security.  As a result Mbus control streams setup using SIP
   MUST use Mbus message integrity using SHA1, and SHOULD use Mbus
   encryption using AES.

   Because Mbus signaled via SIP is more likely to be used over the
   Internet at large it is important to include additional restrictions
   on Mbus implementations in this mode.  All Mbus messages sent over
   SIP-signaled Mbus stream MUST use Mbus message reliability for every
   message and SHOULD NOT send any messages over the Mbus if there are 4
   or more unacknowledged messages.  Sending messages larger than 4k
   over this Mbus is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Because of the dynamic nature of many SIP user agents, these
   frequently need to work behind NATs or Firewalls.  Using Mbus with
   SIP makes it easy for Mbus to be used with the same middlebox
   traversal solutions that RTP [6] uses--STUN [8], TURN [12], and ICE
   [10].

4.  SDP extensions for Mbus

   Mbus uses the control/mbus MIME type and is signaled in SDP with a
   media-line of type "control".  Mbus  in SDP uses the UDP/mbus1.0
   transport.  Mbus MAY run on any port number, including the default
   port number.  Instead of a codec list after the port number (as with
   RTP), a media line for Mbus control messages contains a single zero.

   This document also defines two SDP attributes.  The first attribute,
   called  mbus-addr is a space-separated list of Mbus addresses on
   which this Mbus implementation is expecting to receive Mbus messages.
   The second SDP attribute, called mbus-profiles, contains a space
   separated list of the top-level profiles this implementation is
   willing to accept.  Any of these listed profiles can contain addition
   hierarchy using a period as a separator.

   Since message integrity MUST be used, offers and answers for Mbus
   sessions MUST include a crypto SDP attribute [5] as shown in the
   example below.  (Note that the crypto attribute is on a single line.
   It is only split onto two lines to accommodate RFC and Internet-Draft
   formatting requirements).  [TODO: The ciphersuites in sdescriptions
   are currently specific to SRTP [9].  Either define a new
   sdescriptions ciphersuite, or define the SDP exchange to use Datagram
   TLS [11].]

   c=192.0.0.5
   m=control 47000 UDP/mbus1.0 id:123-45@192.0.0.5
   a=mbus-profiles: remote-cc phonectl.volume
   a=crypto:1 AES_CBC_128_HMAC_SHA1_80
     inline:PS1uQCVeeCFCanVmcjkpPywjNWhcYD0mXXtxaVBR|2^20||

   SIP messages which setup Mbus control sessions SHOULD be sent using
   the sips: URI scheme to protect the keying information included in
   SIP offers and answers.

5.  Security Considerations

   To Be Written.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Need to add IANA templates for registering new MIME type, new SDP
   transport and an SDP attribute.
