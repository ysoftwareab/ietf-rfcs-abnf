                    Abstract 
                        
                       General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface 
                       between a label switch and a controller, and it provides connection, 
                       configuration, event, performance management and synchronization. The 
                       managed objects of RFC 3295 are only defined to configure, monitor 
                       and maintain the protocol entity. Traditionally, network management 
                       services are classified into five categories: those are configuration, 
                       performance, fault, accounting, and security management. These 
                       services are provided by the network management functions, which can 
                       be located either in the controller or in the label switch. In the 
                       GSMP interface, there are no managed objects for the network 
                       management services and the location of network management functions 
                       is not clearly defined. We discussed the complexity of switch 
                       implementation and the efficiency of resource usage according to the 
                       location of network management functions.

                    1. Introduction 
                        
                       General switch management protocol (GSMP) provides an open interface 
                       that can be used to separate the data forwarder from the routing and 
                       other control plane protocols. GSMP protocol is asymmetric, the 
                       controller being the master and the switch being the slave. GSMP 
                       allows a controller to establish and release connections across the 
                       label switch; manage switch ports; request configuration information; 
                       request and delete reservation of switch resources; and request 
                       statistics. It also allows the label switch to inform the controller 
                       of asynchronous events such as a link going down. GSMP contains an 
                       adjacency protocol, which is used to synchronize states across the 
                       link [1]. 
                        
                       In the beginning, GSMP was intended only for use with ATM switches. 
                       GSMP has been extended to support multiple label types those are ATM, 
                       frame relay, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) generic labels. In 
                       the MPLS system, it is possible to run the routing protocols and 
                       label distribution protocols on a controller while passing data 
                       across a label switch. GSMP provides the switch resource management 
                       mechanism needed in such a scenario [2]. GSMP is well suited for 
                       network architectures that employ label swapping in the forwarding 
                       plane. This property makes GSMP a good fit for generalized labels as 
                       defined by generalized MPLS. GSMP extensions have been progressing to 
                       support optical switching [3].  
                     
                     
                     
                    2. Location of Network Management 
                        
                       The document of GSMP-MIB, RFC 3295 defines managed objects for the 
                       GSMP protocol [4]. It is just a protocol MIB to configure, monitor 
                       and maintain the protocol entity. Traditionally, network management 
                       services are classified into five categories: those are configuration, 
                       performance, fault, accounting, and security management. These 
                       services are provided by the network management functions, which can 
                       be located either in the controller or in the label switch. In the 
                       GSMP interface, the MIB for the network management service is not 
                       defined yet, and the location of network management functions is not 
                       reviewed in various factors. The companion draft document presents 
                       managed objects to support network management services in the GSMP 
                       interface [5].  
                        
                       Using the connection management service, we analyzed the complexity 
                       of switch implementation and the efficiency of resource usage 
                       according to the location of network management functions. 
                       Connections are usually classified into two types: a dynamic 
                       connection and a provisioned connection. A dynamic connection is

                       controlled by the signaling protocol in the controller, and a 
                       provisioned connection is managed by the network management system. 
                     
                     
                    2.1 Network Management Functions in the Switch 
                        
                       In the GSMP interface, the controller decides the establishment of a 
                       dynamic connection, and the switch merely responses the commands from 
                       the controller. For provisioning a connection in the GSMP interface, 
                       network management functions can be located either in the controller 
                       or in the label switch.

                       in cooperation with the network management system (NMS), the 
                       controller cannot maintain the exact status about switch resources. 
                       The potential problem is that the controller can reassign a dynamic 
                       connection switch resources allocated to the provisioned connection. 
                        
                       The one scheme for overcoming the reallocation problem is that the 
                       switch resources are divided into two groups: one group is for 
                       dynamic connections and the other group is for provisioned 
                       connections. According to the connection types, the switch resources 
                       are managed by the controller or label switch. The separation of 
                       switch resources will resolve the reallocation problem, but it will 
                       cause the usage of resources to be inefficient. That is, a connection 
                       cannot be established because of its resource shortage, even though 
                       the other group is plenty. 
                     
                       If the SNMP agent is located in the switch, the switch should 
                       implement the SNMP interface as well as the GSMP interface. The 
                       implementation of these interfaces will cause the switch to be 
                       complex.   
                     
                        
                    2.2 Network Management Functions in the Controller 
                        
                       If we consider the SNMP agent is located in the controller shown in 
                       Fig. 2, the label switch can be lightly implemented with the GSMP 
                       slave and basic system management functions. The NMS commands the 
                       controller to manage a provisioned connection, then the controller 
                       issues GSMP messages to the label switch. In this model, the 
                       controller can manage all switch resources for the dynamic and 
                       provisioned connections, so inefficient resource usage and resource 
                       reallocation problem of Fig. 1 can be eliminated.  
                        
                       Especially, this model is effective approach in the environment, 
                       where a single controller manages multiple switches shown in Fig. 3. 
                       It is not necessary for each label switch to implement SNMP agent 
                       function in the centralized server model. SNMP agent is only located in the controller. In this 
                       configuration, the manager can identify each switch using the SNMP 
                       community values, which are uniquely allocated for each switch. This 
                       mitigation of switch implementation burden coincides with the open 
                       interface concept.

                       If the SNMP agent is located in the controller, it is required that 
                       network management functions be mapped with GSMP functions. There are 
                       two approaches to enable the mapping scenarios between the SNMP agent 
                       and the GSMP master. The one approach is using the existing managed 
                       objects, which are defined in ATM-MIB [6] or MPLS-MIB [7-9]. The 
                       other approach is to define new managed objects, which will reflect 
                       the information elements of each GSMP message. The companion draft 
                       document defines GSMP service MIB, which includes managed objects 
                       supporting network management services in the GSMP interface [5]. If 
                       we use the GSMP service MIB, then mapping functions will be more 
                       simple than using the existing MIB. These simple mapping functions

                       can be accomplished because the GSMP service MIB is defined to 
                       accommodate the information elements of GSMP messages. Figure 4 shows 
                       the mapping scenarios for each GSMP message.

                                          Figure 4: Mapping Scenarios 
                        
                       GSMP connection and statistics messages can be mapped with the 
                       existing MIBs(e.g., MPLS- MIB or ATM-MIB) or new GSMP service MIB.  
                       GSMP configuration messages permit the controller to discover the 
                       capabilities of the switch. In the existing MIBs, there are no 
                       managed objects or tables, which are mapped with the GSMP 
                       configuration messages. To support the mapping procedures between 
                       GSMP configuration messages and network management functions, it is 
                       required to define new configuration tables. GSMP event messages can 
                       be mapped with the notifications defined in the GSMP MIB [4]. 
                        
                     
                     
                    3.1 Connection Management  
                        
                       A connection is modeled as a cross-connect consisting of one or more 
                       incoming segments (in-segments) and/or one or more outgoing segments 
                       (out-segments) at a switch. The association or interconnection of the 
                       in-segments and out-segments is accomplished by using a cross-connect 
                       table. To support connection management services, the existing 
                       MIBs(e.g., MPLS-MIB, ATM-MIB) and the GSMP service MIB define five 
                       main tables: interface configuration, traffic parameter, in-segment,

                       To establish a provisioned connection, the manager first sets segment 
                       entries and their associated traffic parameter entries. If the 
                       segments are successfully created, the manager requests the 
                       controller to create a cross-connect entry. If the row status of the 
                       cross-connect entry is 'CreateAndGo', then the controller commands 
                       the label switch to establish the provisioned connection using the 
                       GSMP Add Branch message. If the row status of the cross-connect entry 
                       is 'CreateAndWait', then the controller commands the label switch to 
                       reserve the provisioned connection using the GSMP Reservation message. 
                       If the switch responds with the positive acknowledgement, the 
                       controller completes establishment of the provisioned connection by 
                       returning the SNMP Get Response message to the manager.

                       The manager deletes the provisioned connection by setting the row 
                       status of the cross-connect entry as destroy. Then, the controller 
                       requests the switch to delete the provisioned connection using the 
                       GSMP Delete Tree message.

                       GSMP configuration messages permit the controller to discover the 
                       capabilities of the switch. Three configuration request messages have 
                       been defined in the GSMP: Switch, Port, and Service messages [1]. In 
                       the existing MIBs, there are no managed objects or tables, which are 
                       mapped with the GSMP configuration messages. To support the mapping 
                       procedures between GSMP configuration management and network 
                       management, it is required to define configuration tables.  
                        
                       Figure 7 shows new configuration tables, which are defined in the 
                       GSMP service MIB [5]. These tables are mapped with the GSMP 
                       configuration messages. The columnar objects of these table entries 
                       are based on the information elements of the GSMP configuration 
                       messages.

                       Figure 8 shows the relationship between interface and service

                       gsmpServiceTable represents the list of services and their associated 
                       parameters, which are supported by the switch. The entry of 
                       gsmpPortServiceMapTable represents the service lists, which are 
                       supported by the specific port.

                       The statistics messages of GSMP permit the controller to request the 
                       values of various hardware counters associated with the connections, 
                       input and output ports [1]. The MPLS segment performance tables 
                       contain the objects necessary to measure the performance of segments. 
                       The MPLS interface performance table has objects to measure MPLS 
                       performance on a per-interface basis [7]. The counter information 
                       elements of the Connection Statistics message can be mapped with the 
                       columnar objects of the existing segment performance table entry. It 
                       is possible to map each entry of the existing interface performance 
                       table with the GSMP Port Statistics message.  
                        
                       However, the columnar objects of these table entries cannot be 
                       exactly mapped with the GSMP statistics messages. In the GSMP service 
                       MIB [5], there are two performance tables, which are 
                       gsmpInterfacePerfTable and gsmpLabelPerfTable. These tables can be 
                       fully mapped with the GSMP statistics messages.   
                        
                        
                        
                    3.4  Event Management 
                        
                       GSMP allows the switch to inform the controller of asynchronous 
                       events. The events defined in GSMP are Port Up, Port Down, Invalid 
                       Label, New Port, Dead Port and Adjacency Update [1]. If GSMP event is 
                       received from the switch, the controller will inform the manager of

                       the received event using the notifications. GSMP-MIB [4] defines 
                       notifications, which can be mapped with the GSMP events. Figure 9 
                       shows GSMP events and their related notifications.
