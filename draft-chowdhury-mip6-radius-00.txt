Abstract

   A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and
   IPsec security association with its home agent before it can start
   utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of
   these parameters are statically configured.  Ongoing work aims to
   make this information dynamically available to the mobile node.  An

   important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution is to
   support interworking with existing authentication, authorization and
   accounting infrastructure.  This document defines the new attributes
   to facilitate Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping via a RADIUS infrastructure.
   This information exchange may take place as part of the initial
   network access authentication procedure or as part of a separate
   protocol exchange between the mobile node, the home agent and the AAA
   infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC3775] requires a Mobile Node (MN) to
   perform registration with a Home Agent with information about its
   current point of attachment (Care-of Address).  The Home Agent
   creates and maintains binding between the MN's Home Address and the
   MN's Care-of Address.

   In order to register with a Home Agent, the MN needs to know some
   information such as, the Home Link prefix, the Home Agent Address,
   the Home Address, the Home Link prefix Length and security related
   information in order to secure the Binding Update.

   The aforementioned set of information may be statically provisioned
   in the MN.  However, static provisioning of this information has its
   drawbacks.  It increases provisioning and network maintenance burden
   for the operator.  Moreover, static provisioning does not allow load
   balancing, failover, opportunistic home link assignment etc.  For
   example, the user may be accessing the network from a location that
   may be geographically far away from the preconfigured home link; the
   administrative burden to configure the MN's with the respective
   addresses is large and the ability to react on environmental changes
   is minimal.  In these situations static provisioning may not be
   desirable.

   Dynamic assignment of Mobile IPv6 home registration information is a
   desirable feature for ease of deployment and network maintenance.
   For this purpose, the RADIUS infrastructure, which is used for access
   authentication, can be leveraged to assign some or all of the
   necessary parameters.  The RADIUS server in the Access Service
   Provider (ASP) or in the Mobility Service Provider's (MSP) network
   may return these parameters to the AAA client.  The AAA client might
   either be the NAS, in case of the integrated scenario, or the home
   agent, in case of the split scenario.  The terms integrated and split
   are described in the terminology section and were introduced in
   [BOOT-PS].

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT",  "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   General mobility terminology can be found in [RFC3753].  The
   following additional terms, as defined in [BOOT-PS], are used in this
   document:

   Access Service Authorizer (ASA): A network operator that
   authenticates a mobile node and establishes the mobile node's
   authorization to receive Internet service.

   Access Service Provider (ASP): A network operator that provides
   direct IP packet forwarding to and from the mobile node.

   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA): A service provider that authorizes
   Mobile IPv6 service.

   Mobility Service Provider (MSP): A service provider that provides
   Mobile IPv6 service.  In order to obtain such service, the mobile
   node must be authenticated and authorized to obtain the Mobile IPv6
   service.

   Split scenario:	A scenario where the mobility service and the network
   access service are authorized by different entities.

   Integrated Scenario: 	A scenario where the mobility service and the
   network access service are authorized by the same entity.

3.  Solution Overview

   This document addresses the authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality required by for the MIPv6 bootstrapping as
   outlined in the MIPv6 bootstrapping problem statement document (see
   [BOOT-PS]).  As such, the AAA functionality for the integrated and
   the split scenario needs to be defined.  This requires the ability to
   offer support for the home agent to AAA server and the network access
   server to AAA server communication.

   To highlight the main use cases, we briefly describe the integrated
   and the split scenarios in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively.

3.1  Integrated Scenario

   In the integrated scenario MIPv6 bootstrapping is provided as part of
   the network access authentication procedure.  Figure 1 shows the
   participating entity.

   In the typical Mobile IPv6 access scenario as shown above, the MN
   attaches in a Access Service Provider's network.  During this network
   attachment procedure, the NAS/RADIUS client interacts with the mobile
   node.  As shown in Figure 1, the authentication and authorization
   happens via a RADIUS infrastructure.

   At the time of authorizing the user for IPv6 access, the RADIUS
   server in the MSA detects that the user is authorized for Mobile IPv6
   access.  Based on the MSA's policy, the RADIUS server may allocate
   several parameters to the MN for use during the subsequent Mobile
   IPv6 protocol interaction with the home agent.

   Depending on the details of the solution interaction with the DHCPv6
   server may be required, as described in [DHCP-INT].

3.2  Split Scenario

   In the split scenario, Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping is not provided as
   part of the network access authentication procedure.  The Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping procedure is executed with the Mobility Service
   Provider when desired by the mobile node.  Two variations can be
   considered:

   a) the MSA and the MSP are the same entity.

   b) the MSA and the MSP are different entities.

   Since scenario (b) is the more generic scenario we show it in Figure
   2.

   Figure 2.  Mobile IPv6 service access in the split scenario (MAS !=
   MSP)

   As shown in Fig. 2 the interaction between the RADIUS client and the
   RADIUS server is triggered by the protocol interaction between the
   mobile node and the home agent/RADIUS client using IKEv2 (see [BOOT-
   SPLIT]).  The home agent / RADIUS Client interacts with the RADIUS
   infrastructure to perform authentication, authorization, accounting
   and parameter bootstrapping.  The exchange is triggered by the home
   agent and an interaction with the RADIUS infrastructure is initiated.
   When the protocol exchange is completed then the home agent needs to
   possess the Mobile IPv6 specific parameters (see [BOOT-PS]).

   Additionally, the mobile node might instruct the RADIUS server (via
   the home agent) to perform a dynamic DNS update.

4.  RADIUS Attribute Overview

4.1  Home Agent Address Attribute

   The RADIUs server may decide to assign a Home Agent to the MN that is
   in close proximity to the point of attachment (e.g., determined by
   the NAS-ID).  There may be other reasons for dynamically assigning
   Home Agents to the MN, for example to share the traffic load.  The
   attribute also contains the prefix length so that the MN can easily
   infer the Home Link prefix from the Home Agent address.

4.2  Home Agent FQDN Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign an FQDN of the home address to the MN.
   The mobile node can perform DNS query with the FQDN to derive the
   home agent address.

4.3  Home Link Prefix Attribute

   For the same reason as the HA assignment, the RADIUS server may
   assign a Home Link that is in close proximity to the point of
   attachment (NAS-ID).  The MN can perform [RFC3775] specific
   procedures to discover other information for Mobile IPv6
   registration.

4.4  Home Address Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign a Home Address to the MN.  This allows
   the network operator to support mobile devices that are not
   configured with static addresses.  The attribute also contains the
   prefix length so that the MN can easily infer the Home Link prefix
   from the Home Agent address.

4.5  DNS Update Mobility Option Attribute

   By using this payload the RADIUS client instructs the RADIUS server
   to perform a dynamic DNS update.  When this payload is included in
   the reverse direction, i.e., from the RADIUS server to the RADIUS
   client, it informs about the status of the dynamic DNS update.  When
   the payload is sent from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server then
   the response MUST include the DNS Update Mobility Option attribute.

         Variable length.

      Reserved-1:

         Reserved for future use.  All bits set to 0.

      Status:

         This 8 bit unsigned integer field indicates the result of the
         dynamic DNS update procedure.  This field MUST be set to 0 and
         ignored by the RADIUS server when the DNS Update Mobility
         Option is sent from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server.
         When the DNS Update Mobility Option is provided in the
         response, values of the Status field less than 128 indicate
         that the dynamic DNS update was performed successfully by the
         RADIUS server.  Values greater than or equal to 128 indicate
         that the dynamic DNS update was not successfully completed.
         The following values for the Status field are currently
         defined:

         0 DNS update performed

         128 Reason unspecified

         129 Administratively prohibited

         130 DNS Update Failed

      R flag:

         If this bit for the R flag is set then the RADIUS client
         requests the RADIUS server to remove the DNS entry identified
         by the FQDN included in this attribute.  If not set, the RADIUS
         client is requesting the RADIUS server to create or update a
         DNS entry with the FQDN specified in this attribute and the
         Home Address carried in another attribute specified in this
         document.

      Reserved-2:

         Reserved for future use.  All bits set to 0.

      FQDN of the mobile node:

         The data field MUST contain a FQDN as described in [RFC1035].

8.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in RADIUS message and in what number.

9.  Security Considerations

   Assignment of these values to a user should be based on successful
   authentication of the user at the NAS and/or at the home agent.  The
   RADIUS server should only assign these values to a user who is
   authorized for Mobile IPv6 service (this check could be performed
   with the user's subscription profile in the Home Network).

   The NAS and the home agent to the RADIUS server transactions must be
   adequately secured.  Otherwise there is a possibility that the user
   may receive fraudulent values from a rogue RADIUS server potentially
   hijacking the user's Mobile IPv6 session.

   These new attributes do not introduce additional security
   considerations besides the ones identified in [RFC2865].
