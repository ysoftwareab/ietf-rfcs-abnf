      Registration Data Access Protocol Object Inventory Analysis
                 draft-ietf-weirds-object-inventory-03

Abstract

   WHOIS output objects from registries (including both Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)) were
   collected and analyzed.  This document describes the statistical
   analysis process and result of existing WHOIS information.  The
   purpose of this document is to build an object inventory to
   facilitate discussions of data objects included in Registration Data
   Access Protocol (RDAP) responses.

1.  Introduction

   RIRs and DNRs have historically maintained a lookup service to permit
   public access to some portion of the registry database.  Most
   registries offer the service via the WHOIS protocol [RFC3912], with
   additional services being offered via world wide web pages, bulk
   downloads, and other services, such as RPSL [RFC2622].

   Although the WHOIS protocol specified in [RFC3912] is widely adopted
   and supported, it has several shortcomings that limits its usefulness
   to the evolving needs of the Internet community.  For example, the
   WHOIS protocol has not been Internationalized, it does not
   consistently support Internationalized Domain Name (IDN, described in
   [RFC5890]); WHOIS has no query and response format; and WHOIS
   protocol does not support user authentication, access control for
   differentiated access.

   This document is aimed to build an object inventory to facilitate
   discussions of registration data objects.  Based on this statistics
   result, it may help to form and specify the RDAP response format.

   In number space, there are altogether 5 RIRs.  All RIRs provide
   information about IP addresses, Autonomous System Number (ASNs) and
   contacts, the data model used is different for each RIR.  In domain
   name space, there are now over 200 ccTLDs and 21 gTLDs.  Different
   domain name registries may have different WHOIS response objects and
   formats.  A common understanding of all these data formats is
   critical.

   This document describes the WHOIS data collection procedures and
   gives a data object inventory analysis based on the collected data
   from 5 RIRs and 106 ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs from DNRs.  The RIR data
   objects are classified into IP address, ASN, person or contact and
   the organization that held the resource.  The DNR data objects are
   classified into domain, contact, nameserver and registrar related
   objects.  Other objects that do not belong to above categories are
   viewed as private designed objects.  In this document, we are not

   intended to analyze all the query and response types existed in RIRs
   and DNRs.  The most common query objects will be discussed, other
   objects such as RPSL data structure used by Internet Routing
   Registries (IRRs) will be added at a later time if the community
   feels it is necessary.

   Since this is a document with statistics analysis and there are no
   protocol specifications, the [RFC2119] language does not apply.

2.  Terminology

   o  Data element -- The name of specific response object.

   o  Label -- Different registries may have different naming ways for
      the same data element.  So there may be several labels with the
      same meaning and belong to one group of data element.

   o  Most popular label -- The label which is most supported by the
      registries.

   o  Number of labels -- The number of different labels.

   o  Total count -- The number of registries that support a certain
      data element.

3.  Methodology

   WHOIS information, including port 43 response and web response data,
   is collected following the procedures described below.

   RIR objects collection process:

   (1)  The process of RIR data collection is relatively easy.  There
        are altogether 5 RIRs which are AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC and
        RIPE NCC.  All the RIRs provide information of IPs, ASNs and
        contacts.  Find the 5 RIR WHOIS servers firstly.

   (2)  Query the corresponding IPs, ASNs, contacts and organizations
        registered in 5 RIRs and make a comparative analysis of the
        responses data.

   (3)  Data elements with the same meaning, but using different labels,
        are grouped together.

   DNR objects collections process:

   (1)  A programming script is applied to collect port 43 response data
        from 294 ccTLDs. "nic.ccTLD" is used as the query string which



Zhou, et al.            Expires January 24, 2015                [Page 4]

        is usually registered in a domain registry.  Responses of 106
        ccTLDs were received. 18 gTLDs' port 43 response data is
        collected from their contracts with ICANN.  So the sample size
        of port 43 WHOIS response data is 124 registries in total.

   (2)  WHOIS data from web is collected manually from the 124
        registries that have port 43 WHOIS responses.

   (3)  Some of the responses which are collected by program may not
        seem to be correct.  So data of top 10 ccTLD registries, like
        .de, .eu and .uk etc., was re-verified by querying domain names
        other than "nic.ccTLD".

   (4)  In accordance with the specification 4 of new gTLD applicant
        guide book, [RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733], the
        response data objects are classified into public and other data
        objects.  Public data objects are those which are defined in the
        above two documents.  Other objects are those which are self
        designed data elements or objects in different registries.

   (5)  Data elements with the same meaning, but using different labels,
        are grouped together.  The numbers of registries that support
        the data elements is calculated in the total count column.

                             WHOIS Data of ASN

4.5.  Conclusion

   As it can be observed, for each object (Organization, Contact Person,
   Net-num and ASN) there are fields that are unique to only one or a
   set of RIRs and there are fields that have the same meaning but are
   referred different for each RIR.  In order to construct a single data
   model for each object a selection of the most common and useful
   fields was made.  That initial selection was the starting point of
   the previous document of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].

5.  DNR Objects Analysis

5.1.  Overview

   WHOIS data is collected from 124 registries, including 106 ccTLDs and
   18 gTLDs.  All the 124 registries support domain query.  Among 124
   registries, 8 ccTLDs and 15 gTLDs support contact query. 10 ccTLDs
   and 18 gTLDs support name server query.  4 ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs
   support registrar query.  Domain WHOIS data contains 68 data elements
   that use a total of 550 labels.  There are total 392 other objects
   for Domain WHOIS data.  The raw data can be accessed with the
   following link: WHOIS Statistics Data File [Stat-Data-File]

5.2.  Public Objects

   As mentioned above, public objects are those data elements selected
   according to new gTLD application guide book, [RFC5730], [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].  They are generally classified into four
   categories: domain, contact, nameserver and registrar related
   information.

5.2.1.  WHOIS Data of Domain

   WHOIS data of domain includes "Domain Name", "Creation Date", "Domain
   Status", "Expiration Date", "Updated Date", "Domain ID", "DNSSEC" and
   "Last Transferred Date".  The following table gives the element name,
   most popular label and corresponding numbers of TLDs and labels.

   +-------------------+-------------------+------------+--------------+
   |    Data Element   |    Most Popular   |   No. of   |    No. of    |
   |                   |       Label       |    TLDs    |    Labels    |
   +-------------------+-------------------+------------+--------------+
   |    Domain Name    |    Domain Name    |    118     |      6       |
   |   Creation Date   |      Created      |    106     |      24      |
   |   Domain Status   |       Status      |     95     |      8       |
   |  Expiration Date  |  Expiration Date  |     81     |      21      |

   |     Domain ID     |     Domain ID     |     34     |      5       |
   |       DNSSEC      |       DNSSEC      |     14     |      4       |
   |  Last Transferred |  Last Transferred |     4      |      3       |
   |        Date       |        Date       |            |              |
   +-------------------+-------------------+------------+--------------+

                           WHOIS Data of Domain

   Analyzing the above data, about 95.16% of the 124 registries support
   "Domain Name" data element; 85.48% of the 124 registries support
   "Creation Date" data element; 76.61% of the 124 registries support

   "Domain Status" data element.  On the other hand, some elements such
   as "DNSSEC" and "Last Transferred Date" are only supported by 11.29%
   and 3.23% of all the registries seperately.

5.2.2.  WHOIS Data of Contact

   In domain name space, contacts are typically divided into registrant,
   administrative contact, technical contact and billing contact.

5.2.2.1.  Registrant

   The following table shows all the contact information of registrant.
   14 data elements are listed below.

                           Top 50 Other Objects

   Some elements like "Registrant" are difficult to be classified into
   any categories.  A few registries have two levels of data elements,
   for example:

Internet-Draft     Registration Data Object Inventory          July 2014


         Registrant:
           Name:
           Email:
           ...


   We do not think the first level of elements belong to any part.  So
   they are put into the scope of other objects.

   Some other data elements, like "Remarks", "anniversary" and "Customer
   service Contact" etc., are designed particularly for their own
   purpose by different registries.

5.4.  Conclusion

5.4.1.  Preliminary Statistics

   Some preliminary statistics conclusion could be drawn from the raw
   data.

   o  All of the 124 domain registries have the object names in their
      responses although they are in various formats.

   o  Of the 118 whois services contacted, 65 registries show their
      registrant contact.  About half of the registries (60 registries)
      support admin contact information.  There are 47 registries, that
      is about one third of the total number, have technical and billing
      contact information.  And only 7 of all the 124 registries give
      their abuse email in remarks part.  No explicit abuse contact
      information is provided.

   o  There are mainly two presentation formats.  One is key:value, the
      other is data block format.  Example of key-value format:

                           Top 10 Data Elements

   Most of the domain related WHOIS information is included in the top
   10 data elements.  Other information like name server and registrar
   name are also supported by most registries.

   We did a cumulative distribution analysis of all the data elements.

   (1)  About 5% of data elements are supported by over 111 (90%)
        registries.

   (2)  About 30% of data elements are supported by over 44 (35%)
        registries.

   (3)  About 60% of data elements are supported by over 32 (26%)
        registries.

   (4)  About 90% of data elements are supported by over 14 (11%)
        registries.

   From the above result, we can conclude that only a few registries
   support all the public objects, most of the registries support just
   parts of all the objects.

5.4.3.  Labels Analysis

   The top 10 labels of different data elements include:

                   +-------------------+---------------+

                               Top 10 Labels

   As explained above, name server label is a unique example that many
   registries define the name server elements from "nameserver 1" till
   "nameserver n".  So label numbers of name server are much more than
   other elements.  Other elements about date, street name have more
   labels.

   A cumulative distribution analysis of label numbers was done.  About
   90% of data elements have more than 2 Labels.  So it is very
   necessary to specify a standard and unified format for object names
   of WHOIS response.

5.4.4.  Other Objects Analysis

   According to statistics result, there are 392 other data objects in
   total that are not easy to be classified or privately owned by
   various registries.  Top 50 other objects are listed in the table in
   section 4.3.  You can find that various different objects are
   designed for some particular purpose.  So in order to ensure
   uniqueness of JSON names used in the Restful Whois service,
   establishing an IANA registry is a necessary requirement.

5.5.  Limitation

   o  The input "nic.ccTLD" maybe is not a good choice.

   o  The classification of local script data elements may not be
      accurate. 11 registries give local script responses.

   o  The extension data elements are used randomly by different
      registries.  It is difficult to do statistical analysis.

   o  Sample sizes of contact, name server and registrar queries are
      small.

      *  We only use "Whois contactID/nameserver/registrar" as the query
         commands to check.

      *  Some registries may not support contact, name server or
         registrar queries.

      *  Some may not support query contact by ID.

      *  Contact information of some registries may be protected.

6.  Reference Extension Objects

   There are some objects that are included in the existed WHOIS system
   but not mentioned in the document of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].
   This document is intended to give a list of reference extension
   ogjects for discussion.

6.1.  RIR Reference Extension Objects

   o  company -- the company name registered by the registrant.

   o  maintainer -- authentication information that identifies who can
      modify the contents of this object.

   o  list of resources -- include a list of all the Internet resources
      assigned to this organization.

   o  referral NOC contact -- the Network Operation Center contact.

6.2.  DNR Reference Extension Objects

   The following objects are selected from the Top 50 other objects in
   section 5.3 that are supported by over 5 registries.  These objects
   are considered as possible extension objects.

   o  zone-c -- The handle of a 'role' object with authority over a
      zone.

   o  maintainer -- authentication information that identifies who can
      modify the contents of this object.

   o  Registration URL -- it is usually the website address of a
      registry.

   o  anonymous -- whether the registration information is anonymous or
      not.

   o  hold -- whethe the domain is hold or not.

   o  nsl-id -- nameserver list ID.

   o  obsoleted -- whether a domain is obsoleted or not.

   o  Customer Service Contact -- a kind of contact.
