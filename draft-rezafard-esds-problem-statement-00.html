<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document discusses the requirements of an application layer
protocol which can meet the needs of today's complex and dynamic
supply chains. Currently, supply chain communication traffic travels
over the Internet using existing Internet protocols. This is a
temporary solution for a growing niche. 
This document elaborates on issues that would arise if this trend continues. 

Also, this document
outlines a set of design concerns that an application layer
protocol needs to address in order to be deployable in a real-world
supply chain.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Supply chain Tracking System utilization is rising at an
unprecedented rate. These systems enable tracking and tracing of
physical objects as they move through a supply chain. Deployment
of these systems has grown to a point that they can no longer
operate effectively in isolation from other systems. There is a
need to share data among these disparate systems, which are owned
and operated by separate organizations.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Background</h3>

<p>Traditionally supply chain communication has been routed over private
network infrastructures. However in recent years this practice is 
abandoned in favour of communication over public networks. 
The communication and data exchange has taken the form of 
flat file data exchange, XML, and other proprietary
forms across existing mechanisms, such as SFTP and SMTP.  This method
of exchange requires bilateral agreements and networking arrangements
amongst all partners of a given supply chain.  In this model,
information sharing begins with the supply chain partner who provides
lists of the objects (shipping manifest) that the other partners can
expect to exchange within the supply chain.  While this one way
method is effective in very static supply chain relationships, its
main drawback lies in inability to support dynamic routing 
of physical objects and, therefore, exception
handling.  For example, if an object arrived at supply chain partner
C without prior notification from supply chain partner B or A, the
product remains unidentified and not routable.
</p>
<p>The advent of RFID tags has been a catalyst for the desire to 
reverse-lookup object information.  Products are being tagged
with RFID tags, traditional barcodes, and other types of proprietary
object identifiers.  The exchange of information now begins with the
object and leads back to the supply chain partner.  As the object is
scanned at various key gates in the supply chain, a referral service
must be available to match the object's identifier either to a
relevant supply chain partner or to a list of relevant supply chain
partners and the data services that these partners offer to
a requestor.  This enables supply chains to route flexibly and handle
exceptions.

Terminology</h3>

<p>There are three actors in this problem: 
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Client:</dt>
<dd>refers to an actor that seeks (sources of)
information about an individual object.
</dd>
<dt>Resource:</dt>
<dd>refers to an actor that holds information
about an individual object and may provide it to authenticated
clients who satisfy some authorization criteria (access control
policies and rules).
</dd>
<dt>ESDS:</dt>
<dd>refers to an intermediary lookup service that
enables a client to locate one or more resources.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>What emerges from combinations of these actors and their relationships are:

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Partner:</dt>
<dd>refers to a business entity 
which is comprised of Client and Resource actors belonging to an 
organization.
 
</dd>
<dt>Supply chain:</dt>
<dd>refers to a group of partners that 
have the desire to share information among themselves.
</dd>

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
Information sharing between partners is essential for all modern supply
chain networks. 
There is a strict set of business and technical requirements that must
be observed in order to enable open sharing of information in a supply
chain.

</p>
<p>
There are resources and clients in each supply chain. Each resource wants
to advertise its knowledge (data) to interested and authorized clients. 
Only deploying private networks to connect whole supply chains 
is no longer feasible,
as the more efficient and economical means of connecting resources and
clients is to use public network infrastructure. Currently, many supply
chain track-and-trace initiatives are deployed on public networks and the
information is routed through Internet. Because of this 
trend, it is highly desirable that a standardized protocol should be developed. 
An IETF standards process would ensure that the adopted protocol 
conforms to Internet's operational needs.

</p>
<p>
A key principle of information sharing in the supply chain is that 
data ownership must be respected. 
This means that each partner can collect information 
within their organization and is not required to route that information 
to any other partner. However, they can choose to share selected information
with other trusted partners. This in turn means that the complete lifecycle 
information about any individual object may be held by multiple
resources throughout the supply chain or the product lifecycle. 
Therefore a mechanism is needed in order to facilitate the gathering of 
this information.



</p>
<p>


A key requirement is that information accessibility is fully
controllable. 

The confidential information must be secure and hidden from 
unauthorized-clients and only visible to the intended-clients in a
supply chain. Unauthorized clients need to be barred from viewing,
eavesdropping, or deducing information, in order to establish trust and
reputation with the participating resources.

</p>
<p>
There must be a common set of data that all resources will offer. 
This set must be defined and agreed upon in the final protocol.
This set may include data such as object identifier, lifecycle step,
bootstrap location, links to back-end systems. An essential feature is
for the protocol to be extensible beyond the common data set to
facilitate the needs of supply chains that discover additional uses.

</p>
<p>
Defining a bootstrapping procedure is a necessity when designing a global
and autonomous network of systems. Currently there are deployed supply 
chain systems that bootstrap via Internet's DNS roots. 
One example of this is the EPCglobal Object Name Service (ONS).
While ONS
enables an economical means of bootstrapping, improper implementations 
may increase the traffic on DNS roots exponentially. 
Since data will be routed through the Internet, 
the bootstrapping procedure needs to be formulated under
the IETF standards process.

<a name="rfc.section.1.4"></a><h3>1.4.&nbsp;
Description</h3>

<p>An Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS) provides a
mechanism to locate one or more sources of information about an
individual physical object. This may include the original
manufacturer or supplier of the object, as well as other
organizations who have handled the object at some point during its
lifecycle (including repair and maintenance
organizations) and even organizations (such as customs agencies)
who might hold information records related to the object, even 
though they may have never had physical custody of the object.
</p>
<p>This document defines the Problem Statement, Objectives and
Technical Challenges related to the application layer protocol
currently proposed as 
Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Services (ESDS). 
ESDS captures and queries historical events related to specific
objects with attached object identifiers. The interface enables
disparate applications to track-and-trace shared lifecycle views
of object identifiers across a supply chain. Additionally, ESDS
provides referral services in a loosely coupled mechanism with
granular security that enables selective visibility.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Public Networks and Tree-Walking Concerns</h3>

<p>Currently, another standards body, EPCglobal, has issued a
related standard referred to as ONS (Object Naming Service, 1.0).
ONS is effectively an extended version of DNS that does not benefit
from the IETF review process and, by design, necessitates increased
tree-walking. ONS specifies a reverse mapping of the EPCglobal
"SGTIN" (one type of supply chain object identifier) 
as a domain and allows for a reference (i.e. URL) to a
manufacturer's relevant back-end system (using a NAPTR record). The
SGTIN identifier is comprised of a EPC Manager Number, an Object
Class, and a Serial Number. The ONS lookup excludes the Serial
Number portion of the SGTIN. However, the ONS specification has
already been extended in industry pilot projects to include the
Serial Number, as this enables item level lookups for tagged
objects in the supply chain. Using serial level lookups, ONS could
be used to indicate point to point referrals through the passage of
a relevant identifier throughout the supply chain. This would
require successive updates to the hierarchal ONS to indicate
incremental supply chain partner referrals, reducing the
effectiveness of caching. Alternatively the ONS could provide a
single, static point of referral to the first or initiating supply
chain partner. However, even a relatively static entry, which only
refers to the point of origin within the supply chain, would drive
the number of public zone entries to extremely large numbers if 
an individual record were created for each serial number. One
common suggestion to manage this problem is that multiple alternate
ONS roots can be managed for separate and unrelated supply chains
and/or regions. However, since there is nothing to prevent ONS from
operating in the existing Internet root hierarchy, even alternate
ONS providers can opt to drive traffic to the existing Internet
root servers, rather than operate their own ONS roots. There has
already been a pilot ONS implementation under the .aero zone
(sgtin.id.ons.autoid.aero) where this phenomenon may 
already be observed. ESDS must
aim to prevent this problem by keeping most of the network traffic
off the Internet root hierarchy.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Bootstrapping Concerns</h3>

<p>Currently there are discussions on how to best facilitate a 
bootstrapping processes for objects in the supply chain. The 
bootstrapping process involves locating an object's Discovery 
Service server by an interested and authorized client.  The 
bootstrapping process needs to be enabled with only the 
information provided by the object identifier.  Unlike DNS, where
there is a known set of root servers, ESDS will have numerous 
roots for various supply chains operating globally. 
This, in turn, complicates the bootstrapping process.

</p>
<p>A common bootstrapping scenario is exception handling. For example, 
if an object is mis-delivered, a recipient who has no pre-existing
relationship to the supply chain, needs to obtain object
ownership information and its corresponding Discovery Service server.
ESDS design must aim to accommodate this scenario while 
respecting privacy and security considerations.
</p>
<p>It has been suggested to use the ONS for the bootstrapping 
process. However, ONS's hierarchical identifiers have 
raised privacy and security concerns by multiple
participants in the supply chain. While ONS can technically support
multiple identifier schemes, with multiple issuing authorities, its
hierarchical operation does depend on structured identifiers (for
example, ManagerNumber.ObjectType.SerialNumber). These identifiers
leak information about products such as type and manufacturer and
as a result could compromise the privacy of an individual
transporting them. Additionally, ONS has no authentication or
access control. ESDS must be designed for serial level lookups and
must support unstructured opaque identifiers to use as
lookup keys within an ESDS service. It should fully support
authentication and object level access controls to address privacy
concerns. 
</p>
<p>To facilitate bootstrapping and exception handling scenarios
ESDS design could consider a peer-to-peer lookup protocol such as XMPP. 
This would keep the ESDS traffic flat and avoid walking up the
Internet root hierarchy. A major concern is that the 
bootstrapping design must not implicitly establish monopolies 
in the long run. 
The IETF process will ensure that the resulting protocol design
addresses the concerns of all participants in the global supply chain.

Resource Discovery</h3>

<p>An ESDS must provide a mechanism whereby a resource can
dynamically establish a link for an individual object (or range or
class of objects) that points from the ESDS to the resource. The
link can be expressed as a string or URI and it is helpful if
this is accompanied by an indication of the type of service which
can be accessed via the link (in order to distinguish between web
pages, web services, EPC Information Services (EPCIS) and other
communication mechanisms which might even include phone or fax
numbers)

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Client Query</h3>

<p>An ESDS should provide a mechanism whereby a client can query
the ESDS in order to retrieve a list of links to one or more
resources. Queries may be one-time queries or standing queries, 
and an ESDS may support either type of query, or both.
</p>
<p>The query interface needs to define the criteria fields as well as
acceptable criteria values, such as regular expressions or wildcards.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Security</h3>

<p>Since ESDS needs to be deployable over public network infrastructure, 
issues of security and privacy are of heightened importance. 
Clients must be authenticated to prevent theft of information and
resources must be authenticated to ensure integrity of information. 
The information routed over the Internet must be encrypted. 
It is suggested that the security model be based on open standards, trusted
by the supply chain industry.
</p>
<p>The ESDS protocol should be decoupled from the security layer and not 
have embedded components specific to certain security protocol implementations. 
This will enable ESDS implementations to respond quickly to changes in the
ever advancing security layer protocols.  
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Access Control</h3>

<p>An ESDS should provide a resource with the ability to protect
its link information in order to retain control over which clients
are allowed to read this information. Such rules may be expressed
in the form of access control policies which are evaluated against
the client's authentication credentials and its role in relation to
the provider of the resource, as well as other criteria 
such as the time elapsed since the link was created.
</p>
<p>The situation may arise where a client and the provider of a
resource have no existing trust
relationship with each other. An ESDS should allow a resource to
specify multiple levels of 'visibility' to such a client, 
so that the resource either remains completely 'silent' or 'invisible',
or so that an opaque handle is visible. The opaque handle should
not reveal the identity of the resource in any way, but may be
used to facilitate the initial negotiation between a client and a
resource, if an ESDS or associated service provides such a
mechanism, such as forwarding a number of messages from the client
to the provider of the resource, provided that the client specifies the handle
in their message. To protect the resource provider and ESDS from
additional burden, such a facility may be limited in the number of
messages which are forwarded and the time window following the
client's query during which forwarding of messages is offered.

<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h3>3.5.&nbsp;
Independence</h3>

<p>In today's morphing supply chains there will always be resources
that cannot or will not participate in track-and-trace efforts.
If a resource in a supply chain chooses not to participate, the
protocol architecture needs to be tolerant of this missing link
in the supply chain. The only acceptable consequence of a
non-participating resource would be to miss the information that
would have been supplied had it participated.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.6"></a><h3>3.6.&nbsp;
Identifier Agnostic</h3>

<p> To enable grouping of information belonging to the same object, 
each object needs to be uniquely identifiable as it
moves through the supply chain and its lifecycle steps. 
The protocol cannot safely rely on unique object identifiers
alone, because an identifier may enter the supply chain multiple times. 
One use case for this is 
returnable bins, where the same bin will go through the supply chain
many times. Another use case is airline baggage, 
where the same baggage
identifier could appear the following year, because the 
identifier is only required to include a Julian date 
(the day of the year) but is not required to include the year. 
</p>
<p>As an object moves through the supply chain, it produces events
of interest. The same event on the same object may take on a
different meaning depending on the lifecycle step of the object.
These events would be more useful to the interested partners if they
conveyed some information on the lifecycle step of the object being
tracked. The lifecycle defined by a supply chain should enable
intelligent exception handling by a partner's Business Application.
Also a lifecycle definition should facilitate re-using of the same
object identifier in a supply chain. A possible solution could
include the combination of a non-unique identifier with an 
unique lifecycle identifier.  This would require consideration 
as to how the downstream partners might know the lifecycle 
identifier in order to add additional events of interest.

<a name="rfc.section.3.7"></a><h3>3.7.&nbsp;
Extensible</h3>

<p>The event data needs to accommodate various supply chains and
their business requirements. Therefore it must be an extensible
protocol which enables the partners to communicate messages
specific to their group and supply chain.
</p>
<p>An ESDS protocol should enable sharing of information and
refrain from involving the business rules of supply chains. This
will keep the interface clean and uniform across all supply chains
and ESDS services.

<a name="rfc.section.3.8"></a><h3>3.8.&nbsp;
Retention Policy</h3>

<p>The retention time for data records in ESDS would vary based
on the supply chain's business and regulatory requirements. 
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>For tracking of shipments, the records might only need to be
  stored while the shipment is in transit and has not yet reached
  its final customer (e.g. a few days to a few weeks)
</li>
<li>For some objects (e.g. consumer goods/retail sector), the
  primary interest may be tracking from manufacturer to point of
  sale (e.g. a few days to a few months)
</li>
<li>In some sectors (e.g. pharmaceuticals), regulatory
  guidelines may require records to be retained for several years
  beyond the point of dispensing.
</li>
<li>In other sectors (e.g. aerospace parts), the lifecycle up to
  the point of delivery is only the initial phase of the
  lifecycle of the part - and there may be significant interest
  in tracking the part (and its sequence of custodians and
  information providers) throughout its active service life,
  which can be up to 30 years for some parts.
</li>
</ul><p>[bridge-discovery-services-design]
</p>
<p>So the protocol needs to facilitate defining and customizing these
retention policies in the supply chains.

<a name="rfc.section.3.9"></a><h3>3.9.&nbsp;
Stale Links</h3>

<p>There are situations where the link information (such as a URL)
that was originally specified is no longer effective (e.g. because
the provider of the resource has not taken care to maintain
redirection from the original link address to the new location of
the resource when restructuring a website or moving to a
different domain name). In such situations, it is desirable that an
ESDS can provide a client with link information that is current and
effective. For audit purposes, it may also be necessary for an ESDS
to be able to retain and reconstruct the original (or previous)
link information, even if it is no longer effective.
</p>
<p>This may also imply that an ESDS should allow a resource
provider to loosely couple the link record or event with the
current link address, to ease migration of multiple records to a
new link address, while providing a mechanism to recover a
full audit trail of such changes of link addresses.

Auditability</h3>

<p>Based on some supply chain business and regulatory requirements,
auditing capabilities should be facilitated by ESDS to 
provide accountability if and when something goes wrong. With an 
auditing mechanism, record data can be tracked and the person 
responsible identified, thus a series of data records can be 
reconstructed at a later date, allowing the supply chain to prove who was 
responsible for which data records [bridge-security-analysis].

Responsiveness</h3>

<p>ESDS implementations will need to be designed to accept updates 
in a close to real time basis from multiple providers of
information across the supply chain or lifecycle of an 
object (including organizations
that handle the object beyond the point of sale or delivery, e.g.
for repair purposes, maintenance, returns and reverse logistics, as
well as recycling, remanufacturing and other end-of-life
processes). Because they store serial-level records, they will need
to be sufficiently scalable to store large volumes of data,
possibly up to trillions of records per year.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Availability</h3>

<p>ESDS availability requirements would vary from supply chain to supply
chain. Research by BRIDGE shows that  the uptime requirements for some
supply chains are 99.99% year round.
</p>
<p>It is expected that the ESDS instances will be available over a shared
network that exposes them to the effects of network attacks. 
Furthermore, in many cases it is expected that these components should be globally 
reachable from the Internet and not hosted on a secure private network.
Such components are also built using commonly available Operating 
Systems and middleware (e.g. Application Servers). 
Thus they are also subject to any vulnerabilities of these supporting 
systems.
</p>
<p>A major security issue for shared services such as the ESDS or ONS
is service availability. In particular if you consider services that 
are vital for supply chain processes (e.g. "pharma ePedigree" or 
"product-authentication") ESDS needs to be able to guarantee minimal 
amount of service downtime due to security vulnerabilities and 
attacks [bridge-security-analysis].

Research Bodies</h3>

<p>Currently, the standards organization EPCglobal, 
and EU research projects BRIDGE, SMART, and PROMISE 
are looking into the global supply chain track-and-traceability
challenge. As part of their research, each of them has identified the need
for Discovery Services to link resources and clients in the supply
chains.
</p>
<p>EPCglobal is beginning to gather user requirements for
Discovery Services. However, EPCglobal is a paid membership
organization focused on serving their own subscriber community. 
Although the final ratified EPCglobal standards are open and 
freely available to download, the subscription fees for joining 
the EPCglobal community may deter the greater proportion of 
the global supply chain community from directly participating 
in the development of their global standards.
</p>
<p>IETF would be the ideal standards body to oversee the development of
this protocol because of its deep knowledge of Internet infrastructure
and experience with development of application layer protocols.
</p>
<p>An IETF working group would be an inviting and open community
which facilitates contribution and participation of all interested 
parties involved in the global supply chain. Unlike an EPCglobal 
work group, there would be no economic barriers to participation 
in the development of the technical standard.  The output would 
be released as a freely available RFC in the public domain.
