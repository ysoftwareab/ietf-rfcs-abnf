1. Introduction

    This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
    Namespace Identifier (NID) for Ad-ID Identifiers.

    Ad-ID is the industry standard for identifying advertising assets
    across all media platforms (over the air, on-line, over the top,
    mobile, place based). Ad-ID Identifiers are unique codes for each
    creative advertising asset. Those unique codes are applied to all
    media.

    Ad-ID also provides descriptive metadata about the advertisement.
    The metadata includes the advertiser, brand, product, commercial
    title, product categorization, and other essential data about the
    advertisement.  The metadata can be retrieved by using the unique
    code.

    [Ad-ID-INTRO] provides additional background information.
2. URN Namespace Definition Template

   The namespace definition according to the template in [RFC3406] is
   as follows:

   Namespace ID:

     adid

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

     The identifier structure is as follows:

      An Ad-ID Identifier consists of a unique eleven character string
      or a unique twelve character string (video codes only).

      This string is divided into three parts:

        1. A four-character alphanumeric Company Prefix, not starting
              with "0"
        2. A seven-character alphanumeric code
        3. An optional one-character Video Format Identifier.
          H - High Definition
          D - Three-Dimensional

      The URN representation URN-ADID of an Ad-ID Identifier
      conforms to the syntax (expressed using ABNF (as specified in
      [RFC5234]) :

                   URN-ADID = "urn:adid:" full-adid-identifier
            full-adid-identifier =
            full-adid-prefix full-adid-code [full-adid-suffix]
             full-adid-prefix = (ALPHA / %x31-39) 3*alphanum
             full-adid-code = 7*alphanum
             full-adid-suffix = "H" / "D"
             alphanum = ALPHA / DIGIT

      Examples:

                  Standard Definition: urn:adid:ABCD0001000
                 High Definition:     urn:adid:ABCD0001000H

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

     [SMPTERP2092-1] specifies Advertising Digital Identifier (Ad-ID)
     Representations.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

     The Registrar (Advertising Digital Identification, LLC) is
     responsible for managing the assignment of the Ad-ID Identifier
     and shall ensure the uniqueness by checking the identifier against
     the list of existing ids.

     Ad-ID assigns the identifier, adid, in such a way that the
     uniqueness of the 'adid' will be maintained.  Furthermore, an Ad-
     ID Identifier is associated with a single URN-ADID.

  Identifier persistence considerations:


     The assignment process guarantees that 'adids' are not reassigned
     or reused and the binding between the id and its resource is
     permanent.

     By reference this URN namespace inherits those rules

   Process of identifier assignment:


     Ad-IDs are generated by Ad-ID's proprietary registration
     procedures.

   Process for identifier resolution:

     Ad-ID URNs are resolved via URN resolvers run under Ad-ID's
     responsibility.


   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

     Lexical equivalence of URN-ADID is defined by case-insensitive
     string match.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      As specified above, the syntax of URN-ADID is a subset of the URN
      syntax specified in [RFC2141].

   Validation mechanism:

     The validity of an URN-ADID can be checked using Ad-ID's web
     services.  For more information on Ad-ID's web services, please
     refer to the following links:
      http://www.ad-id.org/user-support/faqs/faq-category/web-services
      http://www.ad-id.org/ad-id-web-services-api-guide

   Scope:

     Ad-ID Identifiers are centrally registered, globally unique
     identifiers of advertising assets, used worldwide.

3. Namespace Considerations

   Ad-ID Identifiers are intended for use in Internet applications,
   where URNs are routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.
   There is no direct mapping from Ad-ID Identifiers to existing URN
   namespaces

4. Community Considerations

   The primary registrants of Ad-ID Identifiers are advertisers and
   agencies.  Ad-ID Identifiers can be used by anyone to unambiguously
   identify advertising assets and retrieve underlying metadata. The
   primary benefits of its use are greater transparency and

   accountability in the advertising marketplace, help eliminate costly
   errors associated with the inconsistent use of advertising asset
   identifiers throughout the advertising supply chain, and enable more
   granular audience measurement across multiple platforms.

5. Security Considerations

   This document specifies the syntax of the Ad-ID-URN namespace and
   makes no security representations.  Note however that failure to
   conform to the syntactic and lexical equivalence rules specified in
   [RFC3406] when using an Ad-ID Identifier as a criterion for
   accessing restricted resources can result in granting unauthorized
   access.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration that is to be entered
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.  It specifically requests the
   Ad-ID NID.

7.2. Informative References


   [Ad-ID-INTRO]
   Ad-ID Identifiers are an eleven character UTF-8 string except for
   High Definition (HD) or Three-Dimensional (3D) codes, which have an
   H or D in the 12th character.

   Ad-ID may have Complimentary Definition Codes (CDC's), which are
   matching SD, HD and/or 3D codes where only the 12th character of the
   code varies. This only applies to Video codes.

   For example, a video with a standard format and high definition
   format would have a single code for each format.
      Standard: ABCD1234000
      High Definition: ABCD1234000H
