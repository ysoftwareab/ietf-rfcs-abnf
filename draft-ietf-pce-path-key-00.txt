   Abstract 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) 
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation 
   Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such 
   as Autonomous Systems (ASs), the path may be computed by multiple 
   PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment 
   of the path. However, in some cases (e.g. when ASs are 
   administered by separate Service Providers), it would break 
   confidentiality rules for a PCE to supply a path segment to a PCE 
   in another domain, thus disclosing internal topology information. 
   This issue may be circumvented by returning a loose hop and by 
   invoking a new path computation from the domain boundary LSR 
   during TE LSP setup as the LSP enters the second domain, but this 
   technique has several issues including the problem of maintaining 
   path diversity. 
    
   This document defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a 
   segment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS). The 
   CPS may be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE 
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource 
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP) explicit route object.

   An important element of inter-domain TE is that TE information is 
   not shared between domains for scalability and confidentiality 
   reasons ([RFC4105] and [RFC4216]). Therefore, a single PCE is 
   unlikely to be able to compute a full inter-domain path. 
    
   Two path computation scenarios can be used for inter-domain TE 
   LSPs: one using per-domain path computation (defined in [PD-PATH-
   COMP]), and the other using a PCE-based path computation technique 
   with cooperation between PCEs (as described in [PCE-ARCH]). In 
   this second case, paths for inter-domain LSPs can be computed by 
   cooperation between PCEs each of which computes a segment of the 
   path across one domain. Such a path computation procedure is 
   described in [BRPC]. 
    
   If confidentiality is required between domains (such as would very 
   likely be the case between ASs belonging to different Service 
   Providers) then cooperating PCEs cannot exchange path segments or 
   else the receiving PCE and the Path Computation Client (PCC) will 
   be able to see the individual hops through another domain thus non 
   conforming to the confidentiality requirement stated in [RFC4105] 
   and [RFC4216]. We define the part of the path which we wish to 
   keep confidential as the Confidential Path Segment (CPS). 
    
   One mechanism for preserving the confidentiality of the CPS is for 
   the PCE to return a path containing a loose hop for the segment 
   internal to a domain that must be kept confidential. The concept 
   of loose hops for the route of a TE LSP is described in [RFC3209]. 
   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defined 
   in [PCEP] supports the use of paths with loose hops, and it is a 
   local policy decision at a PCE whether it returns a full explicit 
   path or uses loose hops. Note that a Path computation Request may 
   request a loose or explicit path as detailed in [PCEP]. 
    
   One option may consist of returning loose hop without further 
   extensions: if loose hops are used, the TE LSPs are signaled as 
   normal ([RFC3209]), and when a loose hop is encountered in the 
   explicit route it is resolved by performing a secondary path 
   computation to reach the next loose hop. Given the nature of the 
   cooperation between PCEs in computing the original path, this 
   secondary computation occurs at a Label Switching Router (LSR) at 
   a domain boundary (i.e. an ABR or ASBR) and the path is expanded 
   as described in [PD-PATH-COMP]. 
    
   The PCE-based computation model is particularly useful for 
   determining mutually disjoint inter-domain paths such as might be 
   required for service protection. A single path computation request 
   is used. However, if loose hops are returned, the path of each TE

   LSP must be recomputed at the domain boundaries as the TE LSPs are 
   signaled, and since the TE LSP signaling proceeds independently 
   for each TE LSP, disjoint paths cannot be guaranteed since the 
   LSRs in charge of expanding the EROs are not synchronized. 
   Therefore, using the loose hop technique without further 
   extensions, path segment confidentiality and path diversity are 
   mutually incompatible requirements. 
 
   This document defines the notion of a Path Key that is a token 
   that replaces a path segment in an explicit route. The Path Key is 
   encoded as a Path Key Sub-object (PKS) returned in the PCEP Path 
   Computation Reply message (PCReq) ([PCEP]). Upon receiving the 
   computed path, the PKS sub-object will be carried out in an RSVP-
   TE Path message (RSVP-TE [RFC3209]) during signaling. The PKS may 
   also, optionally, be used in recorded routes in RSVP-TE. 
    
    

3.      Path-Key Solution 
    
   The Path-Key solution may be applied in the PCE-based path 
   computation context as follows. A PCE computes a path segment 
   related to a particular domain and replaces it in the path 
   reported to the requesting PCC (or another PCE) by one or more 
   sub-objects referred to as the PKS. The entry and boundary LSR of 
   each CPS SHOULD be specified as hops in the returned path 
   immediately preceding the PKS, but where two PKSs are supplied in 
   sequence the entry node to the second MAY be encoded within the 
   first. The exit node of a CPS MAY be present as a strict hop 
   immediately following the PKS, but MAY also be hidden as part of 
   the PKS. 
 

3.1.   Mode of Operation 
 
   During path computation, when local policy dictates that 
   confidentiality must be preserved for all or part of the path 
   segment being computed or if explicitly requested by the Path 
   Computation Request, the PCE associates a path-key with the 
   computed path for the CPS, places its own identifier (its PCE-ID 
   as defined in [PCE-MONITORING]) along with the path-key in a PKS, 
   and inserts the PKS object in the path returned to the requesting 
   PCC or PCE immediately after the IPv4 sub-object defined in 
   [RFC3209] sub-object that identifies the LSR that will expand the 
   PKS into a explicit path hops. This will usually be the LSR that 
   is the start point of the CPS. The PCE that generates a PKS MUST

   store the computed path segment and the path-key for later 
   retrieval. A local policy SHOULD be used to determine for how long 
   to retain such stored information, and whether to discard the 
   information after it has been queried using the procedures 
   described below. It is RECOMMENDED for a PCE to strore the PKS for 
   a period of 10 minutes. 
    
   TBD: Need to define the scope of the PKS and spell out the 
   restrictions on Path Key re-use. 
 
   A head-end LSR that is a PCC converts the path returned by a PCE 
   into an explicit route object (ERO) that it includes in the 
   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Path message. If the path 
   returned by the PCE contains PKSs these are included in the ERO. 
   Like any other sub-objects, the PKS is passed transparently from 
   hop to hop, until it becomes the first sub-object in the ERO. This 
   will occur at the start of the CPS which will usually be the 
   domain boundary. The PKS MUST be preceded by an ERO sub-object 
   that identifies the LSR that must expand the PKS, so the PKS will 
   not be encountered in ERO processing until the LSR that can 
   process it. 
 
   An LSR that encounters a PKS when trying to identify the next-hop 
   retrieves the PCE-ID from the PKS and sends a Path Computation 
   Request (PCReq) message as defined in [PCEP] to the PCE identified 
   by the PCE-ID that contains the path-key object . 
    
   Upon receiving the PCReq message, the PCE identifies the computed 
   path segment using the supplied path-key, and returns the 
   previously computed path segment in the form of explicit hops 
   using an ERO object contained in the Path Computation Reply 
   (PCReqp) as define in [PCEP] to the requesting node. The 
   requesting node inserts the explicit hops into the ERO and 
   continues to process the TE LSP setup as per [RFC3209].

   The PKS object format is identical as in [RSVP-PKS] but redefined 
   in the context of this document since a PCEP codepoint is 
   required. 
    
   The PKS is a fixed-length sub-object containing a Path-Key and a 
   PCE-ID. The Path Key is an identifier, or token used to represent 
   the CPS within the context of the PCE identified by the PCE-ID. 
   The PCE-ID identifies the PCE that can decode the Path Key using a 
   reachable IPv4 or IPv6 address of the PCE.  
    
   Because of the IPv4 and IPv6 variants, two sub-objects are defined 
   as follows.

4.2.   PKS bit

   In this document we define a new bit named the PKS bit defined as 
   follow: 
    
   PKS (PKS - 1 bit - Value=0x60): when set, the requesting PCC 
   requires the retrieval of a strict path segment that corresponds 
   to a PKS carried within the path computation request. The PKS bit 
   MUST be cleared when the path computation request is not related 
   to a CPS retrieval. 
    
     
    

5.      PCEP Mode of operation 
    
   The retrieval of the explicit path associated with a PKS by a PCC 
   is no different than any other path computation request with the 
   exception that the PCReq message MUST contain a PKS object and the 
   PKS bit of the RP object MUST the set.  
    
   If the receiving PCE cannot find any related strict path or the 
   retrieval of such strict path is not allowed by policy, the PCE 
   MUST send a PCRep message that contains a NO-PATH object. 
    
   Upon receipt of this negative reply, the requesting LSR MUST fail 
   the LSP setup and SHOULD use the procedures associated with loose 
   hop expansion failure [RFC3209]. 
    
    

6.      Security Considerations 
    
   This document proposes tunneling secure topology information 
   across an untrusted AS, so the security considerations are many 
   and apply to PCEP and RSVP-TE. 
   Issues include: 
  - Security of the CPS (can other network elements probe for 
     expansion of path-keys, possibly at random?). 
  - Authenticity of the path-key (resilience to alteration by 
     intermediaries, resilience to fake expansion of path-keys). 
  - Resilience from DNS attacks (insertion of spurious path-keys; 
     flooding of bogus path-key expansion requests). 
 
     Most of the interactions required by this extension are point to 
     point, can be authenticated and made secure. These interactions 
     include the: 
       - PCC->PCE request

       - PCE->PCE request(s) 
       - PCE->PCE response(s) 
       - PCE->PCC response 
       - LSR->LSR request and response (Note that a rogue LSR could 
          modify the ERO and insert or modify Path Keys. This would 
          result in an LSR (which is downstream in the ERO) sending 
          decode requests to a PCE. This is actually a larger problem 
          with RSVP.  The rogue LSR is an existing issue with RSVP and 
          will not be addressed here. 
       - LSR->PCE request. Note that the PCE can check that the LSR 
          requesting the decode is the LSR at the head of the Path Key. 
          This largely contains the previous problem to DoS rather than 
          a security issue. A rogue LSR can issue random decode 
          requests, but these will amount only to DoS. 
       - PCE->LSR response. 
      
     Thus, the major security issues can be dealt with using standard 
     techniques for securing and authenticating pt-pt links. In 
     addition, it is recommended that the PCE providing a decode 
     response should check that the LSR that issued the decode request 
     is the head end of the decoded ERO segment.

8.      IANA considerations 
    
   IANA assigns value to PCEP parameters.  Each PCEP object has an 
      Object-Class and an Object-Type. 
    
    
   Two new PCEP objects are defined in this document: the IPv4 PKS

9.      Intellectual Property Considerations 
    
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed 
   to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology 
   described in this document or the extent to which any license 
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it 
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any 
   such rights. Information on the procedures with respect to rights 
   in RFC documents can be found in BCP 78 and BCP 79. 
    
   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any 
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an 
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use 
   of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository 
   at http://www.ietf.org/ipr. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention 
   any copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other 
   proprietary rights that may cover technology that may be required 
   to implement this standard. Please address the information to the 
   IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
