2.  Introduction

   The concept of "channel bindings" and the abstract construction of
   channel bindings for several types of channels are described in
   [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-channel-bindings]

   To actually use channel bindings in GSS-API aplications additional
   details are required that are given below.

   First the structure given to channel bindings data in [RFC2744] is
   generalized to all of the GSS-API, not just its C-Bindings.

   Then the actual construction of channel bindings to SSHv2, TLS and
   IPsec channels is given.

3.  Generic Structure for GSS-API Channel Bindings

   The base GSS-API v2, update 1 specification [RFC2743]describes
   channel bindings as an OCTET STRING and leaves it to the GSS-API v2,
   update 1 C-Bindings specification to specify the structure of the
   contents of the channel bindings OCTET STRINGs.  The C-Bindings
   specification [RFC2744]then defines, in terms of C, what should be
   generic structure for channel bindings.  The Kerberos V GSS mechanism
   [RFC1964]then defines a method for encoding GSS channel bindings in a
   way that is independent of the C-Bindings!

   In other words, the structure of GSS channel bindings given in
   [RFC2744] is actually generic, rather than specific to the C
   programming language.

   Here, then, is a generic re-statement of this structure, in pseudo-
   ASN.1:

                   GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS := SEQUENCE {
                           initiator-address-type  INTEGER,
                           initiator-address       OCTET STRING,
                           acceptor-address-type   INTEGER,
                           acceptor-address        OCTET STRING,
                           application-data        OCTET STRING,
                   }

   The values for the address fields are described in [RFC2744].

   Language-specific bindings of the GSS-API should specify a language-
   specific formulation of this structure.

3.1.  Proper Mechanism Use of Channel Bindings

   As described in [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-channel-bindings], GSS mechanisms
   should exchange integrity protected proofs of channel bindings, where
   the proof is obtained by running a strong hash of the channel
   bindings data (encoded as per some mechanism-specific, such as in
   [RFC1964]) and a binary value to represent the initiator->acceptor,
   and opposite, direction.

   The encoding of channel bindings used in [RFC1964], with the addition
   of a binary value as described above, and the substitution of
   stronger hash functions (or even the identity function) for MD5 is a
   reasonable, generic encoding of GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS that any future
   GSS mechanisms can use.

4.  Channel Bindings for SSHv2

   The SSHv2 channel bindings are constructed as an octet string for the
   'application-data' field of the channel bindings by concatenating the
   following values and in this order:

   1.  The ASCII string "GSS SSHv2 CB:"

   2.  Four octet network byte order length of the SSHv2 session ID

   3.  The SSHv2 session ID

   4.  Any additional application-provided data, encoded as the DER
       encoding of an ASN.1 OCTET STRING

4.1.  GSS_Make_sshv2_channel_bindings()

   Inputs:


   o  session_id OCTET STRING,

   o  additional_app_data OCTET STRING

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER,

   o  channel_bindings_app_data OCTET STRING

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates failure to construct the channel bindings
      as a result, perhaps, of a memory management, or similar failure.

   This function constructs an OCTET STRING for use as the value of the
   application-data field of the GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS structure
   described above.

5.  Channel Bindings for TLS

   The TLS channel bindings are constructed as an octet string for the
   'application-data' field of the channel bindings by concatenating the
   following values and in this order:

   1.  The ASCII string "GSS TLSv1.0 CB:"

   2.  The output of the TLS PRF as applied to a constant octet string
       (TBD) (number of octets also to be determined).

   3.  Any additional application-provided data, encoded as the DER
       encoding of an ASN.1 OCTET STRING

5.1.  GSS_Make_tls_channel_bindings()

   Inputs:


   o  prf_output OCTET STRING,

   o  additional_app_data OCTET STRING

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER,

   o  channel_bindings_app_data OCTET STRING

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates failure to construct the channel bindings
      as a result, perhaps, of a memory management, or similar failure.

   This function constructs an OCTET STRING for use as the value of the
   application-data field of the GSS-CHANNEL-BINDINGS structure
   described above.

6.  Channel Bindings for IPsec

   The IPsec channel bindings are constructed as an octet string for the
   'application-data' field of the channel bindings by concatenating the
   following values and in this order:


   1.  The ASCII string "GSS IPsec CB:"

   2.  The transform ID for encryption, as a 16-bit big-endian word

   3.  The transform ID for integrity protection, as 16-bit in big-
       endian word

   4.  Length (four octet, network byte order) and value of the local
       IKE ID (may be a PUBLICKEY ID[I-D.ietf-btns-core])

   5.  Length (four octet, network byte order) and value of the peer IKE
       (may be a PUBLICKEY ID [I-D.ietf-btns-core]

   6.  Any additional application-provided data, encoded as the DER
       encoding of an ASN.1 OCTET STRING

   See also: [I-D.ietf-btns-connection-latching]

   Note that traffic selectors are not included.  Inclusion of
   confidentiality/integrity algorithms protects against MITMs that can
   compromise weaker algorithms that policy might permit, for the same
   peers, for other traffic.

6.1.  GSS_Make_ipsec_channel_bindings()

   Inputs:


   o  encr_alg INTEGER,

   o  integ_alg INTEGER,

   o  initiator_id OCTET_STRING,

   o  acceptor_id OCTET_STRING,

   o  additional_app_data OCTET STRING

   Outputs:
