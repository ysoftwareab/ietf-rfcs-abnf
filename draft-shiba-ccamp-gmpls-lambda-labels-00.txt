Abstract  
    
   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a 
   consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has 
   been developed and is currently being deployed. [RFC3471] has defined 
   that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has significance 
   between two neighbors". However, in a network composed of a new

1.   Introduction 
    
   As described in [RFC3945], Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS from 
   supporting only packet (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces 
   and switching to also include support of four new classes of 
   interfaces and switching: Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-
   Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber-
   Switch Capable (FSC). A functional description of the extensions to 
   MPLS signaling needed to support new classes of interfaces and 
   switching is provided in [RFC3471].  
    
1.1.     Problem Description 
    
   This document presents details that are specific to the use of GMPLS 
   with a new generation of Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) equipment as 
   opposed to a the prior generation of LSC equipment composed of of 
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) + Photonic Cross Connect (PXC) 
   combined system (shown below) that was originally considered at the 
   time of writing of RFC 3471.

               Generalized Labels for LSC-Capable LSRs      October 2005             
 
 
   Technologies such as Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplex 
   (ROADM) and Dynamic-OADM operate at the wavelength switching level. 
   As such, the wavelength is important information that is necessary to 
   successfully setup a wavelength LSP.

   For technologies such as the ROADM and DOADM, the WDM port mapping 
   does not provide sufficient information for selecting the required 
   wavelength for an LSP. Here are four cases that highlight where it is 
   important to have wavelength information available globally. 
    
   1. Label Set:  A Label Set object may be used to limit the label 
      choices of a downstream node (section 3.5 of RFC 3471).  This 
      Label Set object needs to carry one of the labels defined in 
      section 3.2 of that same document, i.e. either port, wavelength 
      label or waveband label.  In order to be able to generate that 
      wavelength information, it is important to have global 
      dissemination of wavelength information.  
   2. Explicit Route Object/Record Route Object: Here as well, any 
      meaningful information should be global, which implies the use of 
      wavelength since a locally-significant label will have no meaning. 
   3. In SONET/SDH, one can think of the label with the set values of 
      SUKLM bits as locally significant and set their values as a 
      matter of policy to have global meaning. This would add undue 
      burden on the operator to enforce policy. In addition, manual 
      provisioning may lead to misconfiguration.  
   4. Finally, the values for the wavelengths need to be out of the 
      same pool of values to have global meaning.  Any representation 
      of the lambdas needs to be the same on all nodes irrespective of 
      the manufacturer.

               Generalized Labels for LSC-Capable LSRs      October 2005             
 
 
   The ITU-T frequency grid specified in [G.694.1] for Dense WDM (DWDM) 
   and [G.694.2] for Coarse WDM (CWDM) are the labels that SHOULD be 
   used by these LSC LSRs. 
    
    
2.   Label Related Formats 
    
   To deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time 
   domains, several new forms of "label" have been defined in [RFC3471]. 
   This section contains clarifications for the Wavelength label and 
   Label Set definition specific for LSC LSRs. 
    
2.1.     Wavelength Labels 
    
   In section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471], a Wavelength label is defined to 
   have significance between two neighbors, and the receiver may need to 
   convert the received value into a value that has local significance. 
    
   Equipment providing "true" lambda switching (LSC) uses multiple 
   wavelengths controlled by a single control channel. In such case, the 
   label indicates the wavelength to be used for the LSP. In order to 
   allow global meaning, this document redefines the Wavelength label as 
   being an IEEE floating point encoding of the wavelength. As an 
   example of wavelength values, the reader is referred to [G.694.1] 
   which lists the frequencies from the ITU-T DWDM frequency grid. The 
   same can be done for CWDM technology by using the wavelength defined 
   in [G.694.2]. 
 
    
   The information carried in a Wavelength label is: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                             Label                             | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Label: 32 bits 
    
     The label indicates the frequency value to be used. The value is 
     IEEE Floating point encoded. This may be an ITU-T DWDM frequency. 
     For convenience, Appendix 1 provides the list of IEEE Floating 
     point values for the ITU-T DWDM frequency grid. 
 
2.2.     Label Set Wavelength Subchannel 
    
   This document aligns with the general definition of Label Set in 
   section 3.5 of [RFC3471]. However, it provides a clarification 
 
                         Expires October 2005              [Page 4] 

               Generalized Labels for LSC-Capable LSRs      October 2005             
 
 
   related to the subchannel value to be used by an LSC LSR. For this 
   type of equipment the subchannel field SHOULD represent the 
   Wavelength label (ITU-T DWDM frequency grid). 
    
2.3.     RSVP-TE Extensions 
    
   In other to distinguish Wavelength label with local significance from 
   the Wavelength label with global meaning, the latter SHOULD use the 
   same format as the generalized label with the new C-Type (TBA). 
    
    
   In the context of "true" lambda switching, the generalized label has 
   the following format: 
    
   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |            Length             | Class-Num (16)| C-Type (TBA)  | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |               ITU-T DWDM Frequency Grid Label                 | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
3.   IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA assigns values to RSVP protocol parameters. Within the current 
   document an object is defined. This object contains a C-Type. This 
   section defines the rules for the assignment of the related C-Type 
   value. This section uses the terminology of BCP 26 "Guidelines for 
   Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [BCP26]. 
    
   As per [RFC2205], C-Type is an 8-bit number that identifies the 
   function of an object. All possible values except zero are available 
   for assignment. 
    
   The assignment of the C-Type value of the object defined in this 
   document inherits C-Type from the Label object, i.e., object class 
   number 16 [RFC3209]. 
    
   The Wavelength Switching Label defined in this document has the 
   following C-Type value to be assigned by IANA: 
    
     o RSVP_LABEL (Class-Num = 16) 
          - Wavelength Switching Label (C-Type = To Be Assigned) 
    
    
4.   Security Considerations 
    
 
                         Expires October 2005              [Page 5] 

               Generalized Labels for LSC-Capable LSRs      October 2005             
 
 
   There may be an argument that by giving the label global meaning, one 
   would decrease security.  The closest example of using global meaning 
   is the label setting for SONET/SDH. By using a global meaning for its 
   labels, SONET/SDH did not introduce any new security considerations. 
   This serves as an indication that this document introduces no new 
   security considerations to either [RFC3473] or [RFC3472]. GMPLS 
   security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers to 
   [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE and to [RFC3212] for CR-LDP.
