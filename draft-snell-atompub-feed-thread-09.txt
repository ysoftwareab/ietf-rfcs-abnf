1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension for expressing threaded
   discussions within the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287].


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   The XML Namespaces URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML
   elements and attributes described in this specification is:
     http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0

   In this document, the namespace prefix "thr:" is used for the above
   Namespace URI.

   This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
   Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  The phrase "Information
   Item" is omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items.
   Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
   referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,
   when this specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to
   an Attribute Information Item.

   Some sections of this specification are illustrated with a non-
   normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAXNG].  However, the text of
   this specification provides the definition of conformance.

   This specification uses the atomCommonAttributes, atomURI, and
   atomMediaType constructs as defined in [RFC4287].


3.  The 'in-reply-to' extension element

   The "in-reply-to" extension element is used to indicate that a feed
   entry is a response to another resource.  The element MUST contain
   either or both the "ref" and "href" attributes.

     in-reply-to =
       element thr:in-reply-to {
         atomCommonAttributes,
        ( ref, source?
        | href, type?
        | ref, source?, href, type? )
       }

     ref = attribute ref { atomURI }
     href = attribute href { atomURI }
     type = attribute type { atomMediaType }
     source = attribute source { atomURI }


   The "ref" attribute specifies the universally unique identifier of
   the resource being responded to.  The value of the attribute MUST
   conform to the same construction and comparison rules as the atom:id
   element.  The "source" attribute MAY be used to specify the IRI
   [RFC3987] of an Atom Feed or Entry Document within which an atom:
   entry with an atom:id value equal to the value of the "ref" attribute
   may be found.

   The "href" attribute specifies an IRI that may be used to retrieve a
   representation of the resource being responded to.  The "type"
   attribute MAY be used to identify the media type [RFC4288] of the
   resource identified by the "href" attribute.

   Atom feed, entry and source elements MAY each contain any number of
   "in-reply-to" extension elements but SHOULD NOT contain more than one
   having the same "ref" value.

         <summary>This is a response to the original entry</summary>
       </entry>
     </feed>

   To allow Atom clients that are not familiar with the in-reply-to
   extension to know that a relationship exists between the entry and
   the resource being responded to, publishers are advised to consider
   including a "related" link referencing a representation of the
   resource identified by the in-reply-to element.

         <summary>This is a response to the original entry</summary>
       </entry>
     </feed>


4.  The 'replies' link relation

   While responses to an atom:entry may appear within the same feed
   document as the resource being responded to, it is common practice to
   separate responses into a separate feed document or other resource.
   In such cases, it is helpful for an atom:feed or atom:entry to
   indicate the location where responses may be found.  An atom:link
   element with the "rel" attribute value "replies" is used for this
   purpose.  If the type attribute of the atom:link is omitted, it's
   value is assumed to be "application/atom+xml".

   Atom feed, entry and source elements MAY each contain any number of
   "replies" atom:link elements but SHOULD NOT contain more than one
   having the same "type" and "href" attribute values.

   A "replies" link appearing as a child of the Atom feed or source
   element indicates that the referenced resource may contain responses
   to any of the feeds entries.  A "replies" link appearing as a child
   of an Atom entry element indicates that the referenced resource may
   contain responses specific to that entry.

Internet-Draft                 Feed Thread                    April 2006


   For example, replies contained in a separate Atom feed

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">
       <id>http://www.example.org/myfeed</id>
       <title>My Example Feed</title>
       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.org/myfeed" />
       <author><name>James</name></author>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:entries.com,2005:1</id>
         <title>My original entry</title>
         <updated>2006-03-01T12:12:12Z</updated>
         <link href="http://www.example.org/entries/1" />
         <link rel="replies"
               type="application/atom+xml"
               href="http://www.example.org/mycommentsfeed.xml" />
         <summary>This is my original entry</summary>
       </entry>
     </feed>

   The presence of a "replies" link is merely a hint as to where
   responses to entries may be found and does not guarantee that the
   referenced resource contains any responses to any entries within the
   containing feed.

   The behavior of "replies" link relations specifying any media type
   other than "application/atom+xml" is undefined.  Software written to
   conform to this version of the specification will not be guaranteed
   to process such links correctly.


5.  The 'thr:replies' Element

   In some cases, a feed publisher may wish to provide additional
   metadata about a linked Web resource containing replies beyond what
   the atom:link element allows.  For instance, the feed publisher may
   wish to identify the total number of known replies and the date and
   time of the most recent reply, etc.  The "thr:replies" element
   provides a container for this metadata.

     thrReplies = element thr:replies {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute ref { atomUri },
       attribute label { text }?,
       attribute count { nonNegativeInteger }?,
       attribute updated { date-time }?
       ( extensionElement* )

Internet-Draft                 Feed Thread                    April 2006


     }


   The "thr:replies" element MUST contain a "ref" attribute whose value
   is the universaly unique identifier of a Web resource that contains
   replies to the containing entry.  For instance, if a "replies" link
   relation is used to point to an Atom Feed Document, the "ref"
   attribute of the corresponding thr:replies element is the value of
   that Atom Feed Document's atom:id.  The value of the attribute MUST
   conform to the same construction and comparison rules as the atom:id
   element.

   Atom entry elements MAY contain zero or more "thr:replies" elements
   so long as each contains a different ref attribute value.

   The "thr:replies" element MAY contain a "thr:label" attribute
   specifying a Language-Sensitive human-readable label.

   The "thr:replies" element SHOULD contain a "count" attribute whose
   value is a non-negative integer indicating the total number of
   replies contained by the identified resource.  The value is strictly
   advisory and may not accurately reflect the actual number of replies.

   The "thr:replies" element MAY contain an "updated" attribute whose
   value is a [RFC3339] date-time stamp conforming to the same
   construction rules as the Atom Date Construct defined in [RFC4287],
   and is used to indicate the date and time of the most recent reply
   contained by the identified resource.  The value is strictly advisory
   and may not accurately reflect the actual date and time of the most
   recent reply.

   The "thr:replies" element MAY contain any number of namespaced
   extension elements.  For instance, an extension to the thr:replies
   element may be used to identify the URI of an Atom Publishing
   Protocol collection to which replies can be posted.  Such extensions
   MUST be handled as "Foreign Markup" as defined by [RFC4287].

   For example,

       xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">
       <id>tag:example.org,2006</id>

         <thr:in-reply-to ref="tag:example.org,2006:1" />
         ...
       </entry>

   Here, the entry identified by the atom:id value
   "tag:example.og,2006:1" has two replies in the resource identified by
   the IRI "tag:example.org,2006:comments" and one reply included
   directly within the Atom Feed Document.


6.  Security Considerations

   Format, it is subject to the same security considerations as defined
   in [RFC4287].

   Feeds using the mechanisms described here could be crafted in such a

   way as to cause a consumer to initiate excessive (or even an unending
   sequence of) network requests, causing denial of service (either to
   the consumer, the target server, and/or intervening networks).
   Consumers can mitigate this risk by requiring user intervention after
   a certain number of requests, or by limiting requests either
   according to a hard limit, or with heuristics.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relation as defined by
   [RFC4287].
