1.  Introduction

   Wireless LAN (WLAN) Access Networks (AN) are being deployed in public
   places such as airports, hotels, shopping malls, and coffee shops by
   a diverse set of incumbent operators such as cellular carriers (GSM
   and CDMA), Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISP), and fixed
   broadband operators.

   When an end host authenticates itself to such a network, information
   about the location and operational ownership of this network needs to
   be conveyed to the users's home network to which the user has a
   contractal relationship.  The main intent of this document is to
   enable location aware billing (e.g., determine the appropriate tariff
   and taxation), location aware subscriber authentication and
   authorization for roaming environments and to enable location aware
   services.

   This document describes AAA attributes that are used by a AAA client
   or a local AAA server in an access network for conveying
   location-related information to the user's home AAA server.  This
   document defines attributes for RADIUS [RFC2865].

   Although the proposed attributes in this draft are intended for
   wireless LAN deployments, they can also be used in other wireless and
   wired networks where location-aware services are required.

   Location information needs to be protected against unauthorized
   access and distribution to preserve privacy of the owner of the
   location information.  With [I-D.ietf-geopriv-reqs] requirements for
   a protocol-independent model for the access to geographic location
   information was defined.  The model includes a Location Generator
   (LG) that creates Location Information, a Location Server (LS) that
   authorizes access to Location Information, a Location Recipient (LR)
   that requests and receives information, and a Rule Maker (RM) that
   provides authorization policies to the LS which enforce access
   control policies on access to a target.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   RADIUS specific terminology is reused from [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].

   Terminology related to privacy issues, location information and
   authorization policy rules are taken from [I-D.ietf-geopriv-reqs].

3.  Delivery Methods for Location Information

   Location Infomation Objects defined in this document are transported
   over RADIUS protocol from visited access network to the AAA server.
   The information can be delivered to the RADIUS server during the
   authentication/authorization phase described in Section 3.1, or in
   the mid-session using the dynamic authorization protocol framework
   described in Section 3.2.  This section describes message flow for
   both delivery methods.

3.1  Authentication/Authorization Phase Delivery

   Figure 1 shows an example message flow for delivering Location
   Information during the network access authentication/authorization
   procedure.  Upon a network authentication request from an access
   network client, the NAS submits a RADIUS Access-Request message which
   contains location information attributes among other required
   attributes.  The authentication and/or authorization procedure is
   completed based on a number of criteria, including the newly defined
   Location-Information, Operator-Name, Location-Type,
   Policy-Information attributes.  A RADIUS Accounting Request message
   is again allowed to carry location specific attributes.

3.2  Mid-session Delivery

   Mid-session delivery method uses the Change of Authorization (COA)
   message as defined in [RFC3576].  In accordance to [RFC3576], at
   anytime during the session the AAA server may send the access network
   a COA message containing session identification attributes (see
   [RFC3576] for the possible options).  The COA message may instruct
   the access network to generate an Authorize-Only Access-Request
   (Access-Request with Service-Type set to "Authorize-Only") in which
   case it is instructing the access network to send the location
   information attributes.

   Figure 2 shows the approach graphically.

4.  Scenarios

   In the following subsections we describe two scenarios for use of
   location information.  The location infomration may refer to network
   or user location information which in some cases may be identical.
   How the network obtains the user's location information is out of
   scope of this document.  There are two consumers of the location
   information: the AAA servers and other location-based services.  The
   privacy implications of these scenarios are described in Section 13.

4.1  Use Case 1 - Use of Location Information in AAA

   An Operator requires Location Informaion for Authorization and
   Billing purposes.  The operator may deny service if Location
   Information is not available.  Or it may offer limited service.  The
   NAS delivers Location Information to the Home AAA server.

   The user's location is transferred from the NAS to the RADIUS server
   and the NAS and intermediaries (if any) are not allowed to use that
   information other then to forward it to the home network.

   The RADIUS server authenticates and authroizes the session.  If the
   user's location policies are available to the RADIUS server, the
   RADIUS server may deliver those policies in an Access Accept.  This
   information may be needed if intermediaries or other elements want to
   act as Location Servers (see Section 4.2).  In the absence of
   receiving the policies intermediaries MUST NOT divulge the location
   information.

   Location Information may also be reported in accouning messages.
   Accounting messages are generated when the session starts, stops and
   periodically.  Accounting messages may also be generated when the
   user roams during handoff.  This information may be needed by the
   billing system to calculate the users bill.  For example, there may
   be different tarrif rates applied based on the location and their
   maybe different tax rates applied based on the location.  Unless
   otherwise specified, location information in the accounting stream
   may not be transmitted to third parties.

   The location information in the accounting stream MUST only be sent
   in the proxy chain to the home network (unless specified otherwise).

4.2  Scenario 2 - Use of Location Information for other Services

   Location Servers are entities that receive the user's location
   information and transmit it to other entities.  For the purpose of
   this scenario Location servers are the NAS, and RADIUS servers.  The
   RADIUS servers are in the home network, in the visited network, or in

   broker networks.

   Unless otherwise specified, excluding the proxy chain from the NAS to
   the Home RADIUS, the Location Server may not transmit the location
   information to other parties.

   Upon authentication and authorization, the Home RADIUS may transmit
   the Rule set in an Access-Accept to the other Location Server
   allowing them to transmit location information.  Then and only then
   they are allowed to share the information.

   Note since the NAS is the source of all Location information that is
   disimenated by RADIUS, the NAS could tag the location information
   with the location rules or a reference for the location rules
   received in an Access-Accept.  All location information in the
   Accounting Stream will now be tagged.

5.  Overview

   The location information and operational ownership of the access
   network is conveyed in five AAA attributes which are: Operator-Name,
   Location-Information, Location-Type , Policy-Information and
   Billing-Description.  Furthermore, basic authorization policy rules
   are attached to the Location-Information attribute turning Location
   Information into a Location Object as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-reqs].

5.1  Operator-Name Attribute

   This attribute contains an operator name which uniquely identifies
   the ownership of an access network.  The Attribute value is a
   non-NULL terminated string whose Length MUST NOT exceed 253 bytes.
   The attribute value is comprised of the prefix and the identity,
   separated by a colon.  The prefix identifies the operator type;
   example: GSM, CDMA, and REALM.  The identity uniquely identifies the
   operator name within the scope of the operator type.

   As an example consider the string 'GSM:TADIG' where GSM is a prefix
   indicating an operator type and TADIC is a unique globally known GSM
   operator ID.

   This document defines three operator type prefixes which are: GSM,
   CDMA, and REALM.  The GSM prefix can be used to indicate operator
   names based on GSMA TADIG codes.  REALM can be used by any domain
   name acquired from IANA.  Possible forthcoming operator types MUST be
   associated with an ogranization responsible for assigning/managing
   operator names.

5.2  Location-Information Attribute

   This document describes two formats for conveying location
   information: civil and geospatial location information.  Section
   5.2.1 defines the civil location information format.  Section 5.2.2
   defines the geospatial location information format.

   Additionally, the Precision field provides further information about
   the location information provided via Radius.  For large networks
   information about the location of the user can be provided in
   different degrees of accuracy.  This field gives a hint.  Ideally the
   location of the user is returned to the home network but in some
   cases it might not be available.  It has to be noted that the user
   does not provide the location information itself.

5.2.1  Civil Location Information

   Civil location is a popular way to describe the location of an
   entity.  Using an unstructured (as a text string) or a custom format
   for civil location format is dangerous since the automatic processing
   capabilities are limited.

   For this document we reuse the civil location format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil].

   The civil location format includes a number of fields, including the
   country (expressed as a two-letter ISO 3166 code) and the
   administrative units of [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] A1 through A6.
   This designation offers street-level precision.

   For completeness we include more detailed information from
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] with regard to the defined civil
   location elements (A1 through A6):

   Additional CA types are defined in Section 3.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil].  These types are useful to express
   further information about the location, language specific settings
   via the 'language' item and encoding information via the 'script'
   item.  Section 12 shows usage examples of this attribute.

   All attributes are optional and can appear in any order.  The values
   are encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].

5.2.2  Geospatial Location Information

   This document reusing geospatial location information from
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lci-option] which defines latitude, longitude,
   and altitude, with resolution indicators for each.  The value in the
   Altitude field either indicates meters or floors (via the Altitude
   Type field).  As a coordinate reference system Section 2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lci-option] defines (via extensible mechanism
   using IANA registration) three values in the Datum field: WGS 84, NAD

   83 (with the associated vertical datum for the North American
   Vertical Datum of 1988), NAD 83 (with the associated vertical datum
   for the Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW).  WGS 84 is used by the GPS
   system.

   During a protocol run it is possible to return Location-Information
   attributes which provide both location information elements.  If only
   one location information element is provided then civil location MUST
   be included in the request.  Additionally, geospatial location MAY be
   provided.

6.  Policy-Information Attribute

   In some environments it is possible for the user to attach
   information about its privacy preferences.  These preferences allow
   the visited network, intermediate RADIUS proxies and the home network
   to authorize the distribution of the user's location information.

   Without the user providing authorization information two approaches
   are possible:

   o  The user hides its location information from the access network
      and from intermediate networks using the appropriate network
      access authentication mechanism.  Section 13 discusses these
      issues in more details.
   o  The access network attaches default authorization policies which
      prevents intermediate networks and the home network to distribute
      the location information to other entities.  Additionally, the
      home network might have authorization policies which control
      distribution of location information.  Users can dynamically
      change their policies using the authroization framework defined in
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-rules] and [I-D.ietf-geopriv-rules].

   With regard to authorization policies this document reuses work done
   in [I-D.peterson-geopriv-pidf-lo] and encodes it in an non-XML
   format.

7.  Location-Type Attribute

   This document defines a separate attribute for the type of the
   location.  Instead of the values of the 'type-of-place' attribute
   defined in Section 4.6 of [I-D.ietf-simple-rpid] which is reused by
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] we define our own list of values for
   the Location-Type attribute.  The reason for this is given by the
   size constraints of the attribute, dependence to other documents and
   to the location names required for the RADIUS context.  Consequently,
   CA type '25' which equals the placetype is not used in the
   Location-Information attribute as described in Section 5.2.

   The format of the civic address elements is described in Section 3.3
   of [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] with a TLV pair (whereby the Type
   and Length fields are one-octed long).  An example is given in
   Section 12.

   For geospatial location information the Location-Info field is
   defined as follows:

      (3) NAD 83

   The length of the Location-Information Attribute MUST NOT exceed 253
   octets.  The length of the geospatial location information format is
   fixed with 16 bytes plus a four byte header.

   The Datum field contains an identifier for the coordinate system used
   to interpret the values of Latitude, Longitude and Altitude.  The
   field with value (2) and the value (3) both represent the NAD 83
   coordinate reference system but they differ from each other with
   regard to their vertical datum representation as briefly noted in
   Section 5.2.2 and described in more detail in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lci-option].

9.3  Policy-Information Attribute

      location information.  The data type of this field is a string and
      the format is a 64 bit NTP timestamp [RFC1305].
   o  'ruleset-reference': This field contains a URI that indicates
      where a fuller ruleset of policies related to this object can be
      found.  As a deviation from [I-D.peterson-geopriv-pidf-lo] this
      field only contains a reference and does not carry an attached
      rule set.  This modification is motivated by the size limitations
      imposed by RADIUS.  Per-default this field has a null-size.  The
      content of this field is of variable length.

   We use the following encoding for the Policy-Information element.
   The 'retransmission-allowed' flag consumes 1 bit, followed by 64 bits
   for the NTP timestamp and a variable length 'ruleset-reference'.

   We do not use the 'note-well' element since it contains a block of
   text with generic privacy directives which are human-readable only.

12.  Example

   This section provides an example for a civil location information
   format within the Location-Information attribute.  The size of the
   geo-spatial location information object is fixed and well-described
   examples can be found in the Appendix of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lci-option].

   Due to the size limitations of the RADIUS attributes we give a more
   detailed example borrowed from Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil].

13.  Privacy Considerations

   This section discusses privacy implications for the distribution of
   location lnformation within RADIUS.

   In many cases the location information of the network also reveals
   the current location of the user with a certain degree of precision
   depending on the mechanism used, to determine the location, update
   frequence, where the location was generated, size of the network and
   other mechanism (such as movement traces or interpolation).

   Two entities act as location servers in the configuration shown in
   Section 4:

   Entity in the visited network (e.g., visited AAA server): In this
      scenario it is be difficult to obtain authorization policies from
      the end host (or user).  In this case we have to assume that the
      visited network does not allow unrestricted distribution of
      location information.  Hence, as a simplification we can assume
      that per default only the home network is allowed to receive
      location information.
   Entity in the home network (e.g., home AAA server): The AAA server in
      the home network might be an ideal place for storing authorization
      policies.  Once the infrastructure is deployed and useful
      applications are available there might be a strong desire to use
      location information for other purposes as well (such as location
      aware applications).  Authorization policy rules described in
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-rules] and in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-rules] are
      tailored for this environment.  The user typically has a
      contractual relationship to his home network and hence the trust
      relationship between them are higher.  These policies might be
      useful for preventing further distribution of the user's location
      to other location based services.  The home AAA server (or a
      similar entity) thereby acts as a location server for access to
      location services.  As a default policy we specify that the home
      network MUST NOT distribute the user's location information to
      other entities.

   For the envisioned usage scenarios the network access authentication
   procedure is tighly coupled to the transfer of location information.
   If the authentication mechanism allows the visited networks or
   brokers to learn the user's identity then it is possible to
   correleate location information with a particular user.  This allows
   the visited network and brokers to learn movement patterns of users.

   A scenario where the user is attached to the home network is, from a
   privacy point of view, simpler than a scenario where a user roams
   into a visited network (where possibly no direct relationship between



Tschofenig, et al.      Expires January 10, 2005               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft    Carrying Location Objects in RADIUS          July 2004


   the visited and the home network operator is available and some AAA
   brokers need to be consulted) since the NAS and the home AAA are in
   the same administrative domain.  With subscription-based network
   access as used today the user has a contractual relationship with the
   home network provider which could allow higher privacy considerations
   to be applied (including rules stored at the home network itself for
   the purpose of restricting further distribution).

   In many cases it is necessary to secure the transport of location
   information along the RADIUS infrastructure.  Mechanism to achieve
   this functionality are discussed in Section 14.

   One way to ensure that the visited network and intermediate networks
   are incapable to learn the user identity is to use EAP methods which
   hide the user identity either actively or passively.  Some EAP
   methods (such as [I-D.arkko-pppext-eap-aka]) protect the user's
   identity against passive adversaries by utilizing temporal
   identities.  In some cases the visited network is still able to
   retrieve the plaintext identity of the user and user identity
   confidentiality is only provided against eavesdroppers at the
   wireless link.  Depending on the movement patters of the user, the
   network topology and available roaming agreements it is possible that
   a AAA broker is able to see both the plaintext user identity and
   subsequent temporal identities.  Associating location information and
   the user identity is possible in these cases.

   It is assumed that the true username is not carried within the
   initial EAP-Identity Request/Response message exchange.  Support for
   username privacy is supported with [I-D.arkko-roamops-rfc2486bis].

   For stronger security and privacy protection active user identity
   confidentiality is highly suggested.  EAP methods such as
   [I-D.josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap] or [I-D.tschofenig-eap-ikev2]
   provide such a protection.

   Unfortunately, most users are not educated about the importance of
   user identity confidentiality and many EAP methods do not provide
   active user identity confidentiality.  User identity confidentiality
   is often treated as an exotic features which mainly aims to prevent
   eavesdroppers on the wireless link to learn the user identity of the
   attached users.  Awareness for this type of threat model does often
   not exist.  In many cases it is even not possible for users to freely
   select their favorite authentication and key exchange protocol (based
   on their security requirements).  Instead the choice is often
   predetermined by a given architecture.

   It was noted that different granualrity of location information can
   be provided to the home network.  From a privacy point of view lower

   granularity is preferrable.  The user, however, has no control over
   the granularity and cannot lie about its location.

14.  Security Considerations

   Requirements for the security protection of a Location Object is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-reqs]: Mutual end-point authentication,
   data object integrity, data object confidentiality and replay
   protection.  The distribution of location information can be
   restricted with the help of authorization policies.  Basic
   authorization policies are attached to the location information
   itself, in the same fashion as described in
   [I-D.peterson-geopriv-pidf-lo].  It is possible that the user was
   already able to transfer some authorization policies to the access
   network to restrict the distribution of location information.  This
   is, however, rather unlikely in case of roaming users.  Hence, it
   will be primarily the NAS creating the Location Object which also
   sets the authorization policies.  If no authorization information is
   provided by the user then the visited network MUST set the
   authorization policies to only allow the home AAA server to use the
   provided location information.  Other entities, such as the visited
   network and possibly AAA brokers MUST NOT use the location
   information for a purpose other than described in this document.
   More extensible authorization policies can be stored at the user's
   home network.  These policies are useful when location information is
   distributed to other entities in a location-based service.  This
   scenario is, however, outside the scope of this document.

   It is necessary to use authorization policies to prevent the
   unauthorized distribution of location information.  The security
   requirements which are created based on [I-D.ietf-geopriv-reqs] are
   inline with threats which appear in the relationship with disclosure
   of location information as described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-threat-analysis].  [I-D.peterson-geopriv-pidf-lo]
   proposes S/MIME to protect the Location Object against modifications
   and against eavesdropping.  To provide mutual authentication
   confidentiality protection and a digital signature is necessary.
   Furthermore, to offer replay protection a gurantee of freshness is
   necessary (for example, based on timestamps).

   The security of S/SIME is based on public key cryptography which
   raises performance, deployment and size considerations.  Encryption
   requires that the local AAA server knows the recipient's public key
   (e.g., the public key of the home AAA server).  Some sort of public
   key infrastructure is therfore required to obtain the public key and
   to verify the digital signature (at the home network).  Providing
   per-object cryptographic protection is, both at the home and at the
   visited network, computationally expensive.

   To overcome this limitation an alternative approach is suggested.
   Two security mechanisms are proposed for RADIUS:



Tschofenig, et al.      Expires January 10, 2005               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft    Carrying Location Objects in RADIUS          July 2004


   o  [RFC2865] proposes the usage of a static key which is not
      appropriate for protection of location information due to the
      missing dynamic key management and absent confidentiality
      protection.  If no authentication, integrity and replay protection
      between the participating entities are provided then an
      adversaries can spoof and modify transmitted AVPs.
   o  RADIUS over IPsec [RFC3579] allows to run standard key management
      mechanisms, such as KINK [I-D.ietf-kink-kink], IKE and IKEv2
      [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2], to establish IPsec security associations.
      Confidentiality protection MUST be used to prevent eavesdropper
      gaining access to location information.  Confidentiality
      protection is not only a property required by this document, it is
      also required for the transport of keying material in the context
      of EAP authentication and authorization.  Hence, this requirement
      is, in many environments, already fulfilled.  Mutual
      authentication must be provided between the local AAA server and
      the home AAA server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  This is
      another requirement raised in the area of key transport with
      RADIUS and does not represent a deployment obstacle.  The
      performance advantages a superior compared to the usage of S/MIME
      and object security since the expensive authentication and key
      exchange protocol run needs to be provided only once (at for a
      long time).  Symmetric channel security with IPsec is highly
      efficient.  Since IPsec protection is suggested as a mechanism to
      protect RAIDUS already no additional considerations need to be
      addressed beyond those described in [RFC3579].  Where an untrusted
      AAA intermediary is present, the Location Object MUST NOT be
      provided to the intermediary.
