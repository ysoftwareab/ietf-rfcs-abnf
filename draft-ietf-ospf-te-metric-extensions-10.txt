              OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions
                draft-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions-10.txt




   Abstract

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network
   performance information (e.g., latency) is becoming critical to data
   path selection.

   This document describes common extensions to RFC 3630 "Traffic
   Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2" and RFC 5329 "Traffic
   Engineering Extensions to OSPF Version 3" to enable network
   performance information to be distributed in a scalable fashion. The
   information distributed using OSPF TE Metric Extensions can then be
   used to make path selection decisions based on network performance.

   Note that this document only covers the mechanisms by which network
   performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring
   network performance information or using that information, once
   distributed, are outside the scope of this document.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft        OSPF TE Metric Extensions            January 2015





1. Introduction

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network
   performance information (e.g., latency) is becoming as critical to
   data path selection as other metrics.

   Because of this, using metrics such as hop count or cost as routing
   metrics is becoming only tangentially important. Rather, it would be
   beneficial to be able to make path selection decisions based on
   performance data (such as latency) in a cost-effective and scalable
   way.

   This document describes extensions to OSPF TE (hereafter called "OSPF
   TE Metric Extensions"), that can be used to distribute network
   performance information (viz link delay, delay variation, link loss,
   residual bandwidth, available bandwidth, and utilized bandwidth).

   The data distributed by OSPF TE Metric Extensions is meant to be used
   as part of the operation of the routing protocol (e.g., by replacing
   cost with latency or considering bandwidth as well as cost), by
   enhancing CSPF, or for use by a PCE [RFC4655] or an Alto server
   [RFC7285]. With respect to CSPF, the data distributed by OSPF TE
   Metric Extensions can be used to setup, fail over, and fail back data
   paths using protocols such as RSVP-TE [RFC3209].

   Note that the mechanisms described in this document only disseminate
   performance information.  The methods for initially gathering that
   performance information or acting on it once it is distributed are
   outside the scope of this document.  Example mechanisms to measure
   latency, delay variation, and loss in an MPLS network are given in
   [RFC6374].

   While this document does not specify how the performance information
   should be obtained, the measurement of delay SHOULD NOT vary
   significantly based upon the offered traffic load.  Thus, queuing
   delays and/or loss SHOULD NOT be included in any dynamic delay
   measurement.  For links, such as Forwarding Adjacencies, care must
   be taken that measurement of the associated delay avoids significant
   queuing delay; this can be accomplished in a variety of ways, e.g.,
   measuring with a traffic class that experiences minimal queuing or

   summing the measured link delays of the components of the link's
   path.


2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.



3. TE Metric Extensions to OSPF TE

   This document defines new OSPF TE sub-TLVs that can be announced in
   OSPF TE LSAs to distribute network performance information. The
   extensions in this document build on the ones provided in OSPFv2 TE
   [RFC3630] and OSPFv3 TE [RFC5329].

   OSPF TE LSAs are opaque LSAs [RFC5250] with area flooding scope.
   Each consists of a single TLV with one or more nested sub-TLVs,
   permitting the TE LSA to be readily extended. The Link TLV is common
   to both OSPFv2 TE [RFC3630] and OSPFv3 TE [RFC5329] and describes
   the characteristics of a link between OSPF neighbors.

   This document defines several additional sub-TLVs for the Link TLV:

   Type  Length   Value

   TBD1  4        Unidirectional Link Delay

   TBD2  8        Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

   TBD3  4        Unidirectional Delay Variation

   TBD4  4        Unidirectional Link Loss

   TBD5  4        Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

   TBD6  4        Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

   TBD7  4        Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth

Internet-Draft        OSPF TE Metric Extensions            January 2015




   As can be seen in the list above, the sub-TLVs described in this
   document carry different types of network performance information.
   Many (but not all) of the sub-TLVs include a bit called the Anomalous
   (or A) bit. When the A bit is clear (or when the sub-TLV does not
   include an A bit), the sub-TLV describes steady state link
   performance. This information could conceivably be used to construct
   a steady state performance topology for initial tunnel path
   computation, or to verify alternative failover paths.

   When network performance violates configurable link-local thresholds
   a sub-TLV with the A bit set is advertised. These sub-TLVs could be
   used by the receiving node to determine whether to fail traffic to a
   backup path, or whether to calculate an entirely new path. From an
   MPLS perspective, the intent of the A bit is to permit LSP ingress
   nodes to:

   A) Determine whether the link referenced in the sub-TLV affects any
      of the LSPs for which it is ingress. If there are, then:

   B) The node determines whether those LSPs still meet end-to-end
      performance objectives. If not, then:

   C) The node could then conceivably move affected traffic to a pre-
      established protection LSP or establish a new LSP and place the
      traffic in it.

   If link performance then improves beyond a configurable minimum
   value (reuse threshold), that sub-TLV can be re-advertised with the
   Anomalous bit cleared. In this case, a receiving node can
   conceivably do whatever re-optimization (or failback) it wishes to
   do (including nothing).

   The A bit was intentionally omitted from some sub-TLVs to help
   mitigate oscillations. See section 7. 1. for more information.

   Link delay, delay variation, and link loss MUST be encoded as
   integers. Consistent with existing OSPF TE specifications [RFC3630],
   residual, available, and utilized bandwidth MUST be encoded in IEEE
   floating point [IEEE754]. Link delay and delay variation MUST be in
   units of microseconds, link loss MUST be a percentage, and bandwidth
   MUST be in units of bytes per second. All values (except residual
   bandwidth) MUST be calculated as rolling averages where the averaging
   period MUST be a configurable period of time. See section 5. for more
   information.

4. Sub-TLV Details

4.1. Unidirectional Link Delay Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV advertises the average link delay between two directly
   connected OSPF neighbors. The delay advertised by this sub-TLV MUST
   be the delay from the advertising node to its neighbor (i.e., the
   forward path delay). The format of this sub-TLV is shown in the
   following diagram:

     0                   1                   2                   3

4.1.2. Length

   The length is 4.

4.1.3. A bit

   This field represents the Anomalous (A) bit. The A bit is set when
   the measured value of this parameter exceeds its configured maximum
   threshold. The A bit is cleared when the measured value falls below
   its configured reuse threshold. If the A bit is clear, the sub-TLV
   represents steady state link performance.

   and MUST be ignored when received.

4.1.5. Delay Value

   This 24-bit field carries the average link delay over a configurable
   interval in micro-seconds, encoded as an integer value. When set to
   the maximum value 16,777,215 (16.777215 sec), then the delay is at

   least that value and may be larger.  If there is no value to send
   (unmeasured and not statically specified), then the sub-TLV should
   not be sent or be withdrawn.



4.2. Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV advertises the minimum and maximum delay values between
   two directly connected OSPF neighbors. The delay advertised by this
   sub-TLV MUST be the delay from the advertising node to its neighbor
   (i.e., the forward path delay). The format of this sub-TLV is shown
   in the following diagram:

     0                   1                   2                   3

4.2.1. Type

   This sub-TLV has a type of TBD2.

4.2.2. Length

   The length is 8.

4.2.3. A bit

   This field represents the Anomalous (A) bit. The A bit is set when
   one or more measured values exceed a configured maximum threshold.
   The A bit is cleared when the measured value falls below its
   configured reuse threshold. If the A bit is clear, the sub-TLV
   represents steady state link performance.

4.2.4. Reserved

   This field is reserved for future use. It MUST be set to 0 when sent
   and MUST be ignored when received.

4.2.5. Min Delay

   This 24-bit field carries minimum measured link delay value (in
   microseconds) over a configurable interval, encoded as an integer
   value.

   Implementations MAY also permit the configuration of an offset value
   (in microseconds) to be added to the measured delay value to
   advertise operator specific delay constraints.

   When set to the maximum value 16,777,215 (16.777215 sec), then the
   delay is at least that value and may be larger.

4.2.6. Reserved

   This field is reserved for future use.  It MUST be set to 0 when sent
   and MUST be ignored when received.

4.2.7 Max Delay

   This 24-bit field carries the maximum measured link delay value (in
   microseconds) over a configurable interval, encoded as an integer
   value.

   Implementations MAY also permit the configuration of an offset value
   (in microseconds) to be added to the measured delay value to
   advertise operator specific delay constraints.

   It is possible for min delay and max delay to be the same value.

   When the delay value is set to maximum value 16,777,215 (16.777215
   sec), then the delay is at least that value and may be larger.

4.3. Unidirectional Delay Variation Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV advertises the average link delay variation between two
   directly connected OSPF neighbors. The delay variation advertised by
   this sub-TLV MUST be the delay from the advertising node to its
   neighbor (i.e., the forward path delay variation). The format of this
   sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   and MUST be ignored when received.



4.3.4. Delay Variation

   This 24-bit field carries the average link delay variation over a
   configurable interval in micro-seconds, encoded as an integer value.
   When set to 0, it has not been measured. When set to the maximum
   value 16,777,215 (16.777215 sec), then the delay is at least that
   value and may be larger.



4.4. Unidirectional Link Loss Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV advertises the loss (as a packet percentage) between two
   directly connected OSPF neighbors. The link loss advertised by this
   sub-TLV MUST be the packet loss from the advertising node to its
   neighbor (i.e., the forward path loss). The format of this sub-TLV is

   This 24-bit field carries link packet loss as a percentage of the
   total traffic sent over a configurable interval.  The basic unit is
   0.000003%, where (2^24 - 2) is 50.331642%. This value is the highest
   packet loss percentage that can be expressed (the assumption being
   that precision is more important on high speed links than the ability
   to advertise loss rates greater than this, and that high speed links
   with over 50% loss are unusable). Therefore, measured values that are
   larger than the field maximum SHOULD be encoded as the maximum value.
   When set to a value of all 1s (2^24 - 1), the link packet loss has
   not been measured.



4.5. Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV advertises the residual bandwidth between two directly
   connected OSPF neighbors. The residual bandwidth advertised by this
   sub-TLV MUST be the residual bandwidth from the advertising node to
   its neighbor.

   The format of this sub-TLV is shown in the following diagram:

4.5.1. Type

    This sub-TLV has a type of TBD5.

4.5.2. Length

   The length is 4.

4.5.3. Residual Bandwidth

   This field carries the residual bandwidth on a link, forwarding
   adjacency [RFC4206], or bundled link in IEEE floating point format
   with units of bytes per second.  For a link or forwarding adjacency,
   residual bandwidth is defined to be Maximum Bandwidth [RFC3630] minus
   the bandwidth currently allocated to RSVP-TE LSPs.  For a bundled
   link, residual bandwidth is defined to be the sum of the component
   link residual bandwidths.

   The calculation of Residual Bandwidth is different than that of
   Unreserved Bandwidth [RFC3630]. Residual Bandwidth subtracts tunnel
   reservations from Maximum Bandwidth (i.e., the link capacity)
   [RFC3630] and provides an aggregated remainder across QoS classes.
   Unreserved Bandwidth [RFC3630], on the other hand, is subtracted from
   the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (the bandwidth that can
   theoretically be reserved) [RFC3630] and provides per-QoS-class
   remainders. Residual Bandwidth and Unreserved Bandwidth [RFC3630] can
   be used concurrently, and each has a separate use case (e.g., the
   former can be used for applications like Weighted ECMP while the
   latter can be used for call admission control).



4.6. Unidirectional Available Bandwidth Sub-TLV

   This TLV advertises the available bandwidth between two directly
   connected OSPF neighbors. The available bandwidth advertised by this
   sub-TLV MUST be the available bandwidth from the advertising node to

4.6.1. Type

4.6.3. Available Bandwidth

   This field carries the available bandwidth on a link, forwarding
   adjacency, or bundled link in IEEE floating point format with units
   of bytes per second.  For a link or forwarding adjacency, available
   bandwidth is defined to be residual bandwidth (see section 4.5. )
   minus the measured bandwidth used for the actual forwarding of non-
   RSVP-TE LSP packets.  For a bundled link, available bandwidth is
   defined to be the sum of the component link available bandwidths.



4.7. Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV advertises the bandwidth utilization between two
   directly connected OSPF neighbors. The bandwidth utilization
   advertised by this sub-TLV MUST be the bandwidth from the advertising
   node to its neighbor. The format of this Sub-TLV is shown in the
   following diagram:



     0                   1                   2                   3

4.7.1. Type

   This sub-TLV has a type of TBD7.

4.7.2. Length

   The length is 4.

4.7.3. Utilized Bandwidth

   This field carries the bandwidth utilization on a link, forwarding
   adjacency, or bundled link in IEEE floating point format with units
   of bytes per second. For a link or forwarding adjacency, bandwidth
   utilization represents the actual utilization of the link (i.e., as
   measured by the advertising node). For a bundled link, bandwidth
   utilization is defined to be the sum of the component link bandwidth
   utilizations.



5. Announcement Thresholds and Filters

   The values advertised in all sub-TLVs (except min/max delay and
   residual bandwidth) MUST represent an average over a period or be
   obtained by a filter that is reasonably representative of an
   average. For example, a rolling average is one such filter.

   Min and max delay MAY be the lowest and/or highest measured value
   over a measurement interval or MAY make use of a filter, or other
   technique to obtain a reasonable representation of a min and max
   value representative of the interval with compensation for outliers.

   The measurement interval, any filter coefficients, and any
   advertisement intervals MUST be configurable per sub-TLV.

   In addition to the measurement intervals governing re-advertisement,
   implementations SHOULD provide per sub-TLV configurable accelerated
   advertisement thresholds, such that:

   1. If the measured parameter falls outside a configured upper bound
      for all but the min delay metric (or lower bound for min delay



Giacalone, et al         Expires July 5, 2015                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        OSPF TE Metric Extensions            January 2015


      metric only) and the advertised sub-TLV is not already outside
      that bound or,

   2. If the difference between the last advertised value and current
      measured value exceed a configured threshold then,

   3. The advertisement is made immediately.

   4. For sub-TLVs which include an A-bit (except min/max delay), an
      additional threshold SHOULD be included corresponding to the
      threshold for which the performance is considered anomalous (and
      sub-TLVs with the A bit are sent). The A-bit is cleared when the
      sub-TLV's performance has been below (or re-crosses) this
      threshold for an advertisement interval(s) to permit fail back.

   To prevent oscillations, only the high threshold or the low threshold
   (but not both) may be used to trigger any given sub-TLV that supports
   both.

   Additionally, once outside of the bounds of the threshold, any re-
   advertisement of a measurement within the bounds would remain
   governed solely by the measurement interval for that sub-TLV.



6. Announcement Suppression

   When link performance values change by small amounts that fall under
   thresholds that would cause the announcement of a sub-TLV,
   implementations SHOULD suppress sub-TLV re-advertisement and/or
   lengthen the period within which they are refreshed.

   Only the accelerated advertisement threshold mechanism described in
   section 5 may shorten the re-advertisement interval.

   All suppression and re-advertisement interval back-off timer features
   SHOULD be configurable.



7. Network Stability and Announcement Periodicity

   Sections 5 and 6 provide configurable mechanisms to bound the number
   of re-advertisements.  Instability might occur in very large networks
   if measurement intervals are set low enough to overwhelm the
   processing of flooded information at some of the routers in the
   topology. Therefore care SHOULD be taken in setting these values.


Giacalone, et al         Expires July 5, 2015                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        OSPF TE Metric Extensions            January 2015


   Additionally, the default measurement interval for all sub-TLVs
   SHOULD be 30 seconds.

   Announcements MUST also be able to be throttled using configurable
   inter-update throttle timers. The minimum announcement periodicity is
   1 announcement per second. The default value SHOULD be set to 120
   seconds.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT permit the inter-update timer to be lower
   than the measurement interval.

   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that any underlying performance
   measurement mechanisms not include any significant buffer delay, any
   significant buffer induced delay variation, or any significant
   loss due to buffer overflow or due to active queue management.



8. Enabling and Disabling Sub-TLVs

   Implementations MUST make it possible to individually enable or
   disable each sub-TLV based on configuration.



9. Static Metric Override

   Implementations SHOULD permit the static configuration and/or manual
   override of dynamic measurements data on a per sub-TLV, per metric
   basis in order to simplify migrations and to mitigate scenarios where
   measurements are not possible across an entire network.





10. Compatibility

   As per [RFC3630], an unrecognized TLV should be silently ignored.
   I.e., it should not be processed but it should be included in LSAs
   sent to OSPF neighbors.

11. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC3630].  OSPFv2 HMAC-SHA [RFC5709] provides
   additional protection for OSPFv2.

   OSPF KARP [RFC6863] provides an analysis of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 routing
   security and OSPFv2 Security Extensions [OSPFSEC] provides extensions
   designed to address the identified gaps in OSPFv2.



12. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the registry for the Link TLV sub-TLVs. OSPF TE Metric
   Extensions will require one new type code per sub-TLV defined in this
   document, as follows:

   Type  Description

   TBD1  Unidirectional Link Delay

   TBD2  Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

   TBD3  Unidirectional Delay Variation

   TBD4  Unidirectional Link Loss

   TBD5  Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

   TBD6  Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

   TBD7  Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth
