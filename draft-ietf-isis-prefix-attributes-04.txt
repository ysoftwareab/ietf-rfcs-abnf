1.  Introduction

   IS-IS is a link state routing protocol defined in [ISO10589] and
   [RFC1195].  Extensions in support of advertising new forms of IP/IPv6
   prefix reachability are defined in [RFC5305], [RFC5308], and
   [RFC5120].

   There are existing use cases in which knowing additional attributes
   of a prefix is useful.

   It is useful to know whether an advertised prefix is directly
   connected to the advertising router or not.  In the case of [SR]
   knowing whether a prefix is directly connected or not determines what
   action should be taken as regards processing of labels associated
   with an incoming packet.

   It is useful to know what addresses can be used as addresses of the
   node in support of services (e.g., Remote Loop Free Alternate (RLFA)
   endpoint).

   Current formats of the Extended Reachability TLVs for both IP and
   IPv6 are fixed and do not allow the introduction of additional flags
   without backwards compatibility issues.  Therefore a new sub-TLV is
   introduced which allows for the advertisement of attribute flags
   associated with prefix advertisements.

   In cases where multiple node addresses are advertised by a given
   router it is also useful to be able to associate all of these
   addresses with a single Router-ID even when prefixes are advertised
   outside of the area in which they are originated.  Therefore a new
   sub-TLV is introduced to advertise the router-id of the originator of
   a prefix advertisement.

2.  New sub-TLVs for Extended Reachability TLVs

   The following new sub-TLVs are introduced:

   o  IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attributes

   o  IPv4 Source Router ID

   o  IPv6 Source Router ID

   All sub-TLVs are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, and/or 237.

2.1.  IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attribute Flags

   This sub-TLV supports the advertisement of additional flags
   associated with a given prefix advertisement.  The behavior of each
   flag when a prefix advertisement is leaked from one level to another
   (upwards or downwards) is explicitly defined below.

   All flags are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, 237 unless otherwise
   stated.

   Prefix Attribute Flags
   Type:   4 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
   Length: Number of octets to follow
   Value

        (Length * 8) bits.

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
    |X|R|N|          ...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

   Bits are defined/sent starting with Bit #0 defined below. Additional
   bit definitions which may be defined in the future SHOULD be assigned
   in ascending bit order so as to minimize the number of bits which
   will need to be transmitted.

   Undefined bits MUST be transmitted as 0 and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

   Bits which are NOT transmitted MUST be treated as if they are
   set to 0 on receipt.

   X-Flag: External Prefix Flag (Bit 0)
       Set if the prefix has been redistributed from another protocol.
       This includes the case where multiple virtual routers are
       supported and the source of the redistributed prefix is another
       IS-IS instance.
       The flag MUST be preserved when leaked between levels.
       In TLVs 236 and 237 this flag SHOULD always be sent as 0 and
       MUST be ignored on receipt. This is because there is an existing
       X flag defined in the fixed format of these TLVs as specified in
       [RFC5308] and [RFC5120].

   R-Flag: Re-advertisement Flag (Bit 1)
       Set when the prefix has been leaked from one level to another
       (upwards or downwards).

   N-flag: Node Flag (Bit 2)
       Set when the prefix identifies the advertising router i.e., the
       prefix is a host prefix advertising a globally reachable address
       typically associated with a loopback address.
       The advertising router MAY choose to NOT set this flag even when
       the above conditions are met.
       If the flag is set and the prefix length is NOT a host prefix
       (/32 for IPV4, /128 for IPv6) then the flag MUST be ignored.
       The flag MUST be preserved when leaked between levels.

2.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Source Router ID

   When a reachability advertisement is leaked from one level to
   another, the source of the original advertisement is unknown.  In
   cases where the advertisement is an identifier for the advertising
   router (e.g., N-flag set in the Extended Reachability Attribute sub-
   TLV as described in the previous section) it may be useful for other
   routers to know the source of the advertisement.  The sub-TLVs
   defined below provide this information.

   Note that the Router ID advertised is always the Router ID of the IS-
   IS instance which originated the advertisement.  This would be true
   even if the prefix has been learned from another protocol (X-flag set
   as defined in Section 2.1).

     IPv4 Source Router ID
     Type:   11 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
     Length: 4
     Value: IPv4 Router ID of the source of the advertisement

     Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs
     135, 235, 236, or 237. When included the value MUST be
     identical to the value advertised in Traffic Engineering
     router ID (TLV 134) defined in [RFC5305].

     If present the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix
     advertisement is leaked to another level.

     IPv6 Source Router ID
     Type:   12 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
     Length: 16
     Value: IPv6 Router ID of the source of the advertisement

     Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs
     135, 235, 236, or 237. When included the value MUST be
     identical to the value advertised in IPv6 TE Router ID
     (TLV 140) defined in [RFC6119].

     If present the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix
     advertisement is leaked to another level.


2.3.  Advertising Router IDs

   [RFC5305] and [RFC6119] define the advertisement of router IDs for
   IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.  Although both drafts discuss the use of
   router ID in the context of Traffic Engineering (TE), the
   advertisement of router IDs is explicitly allowed for purposes other

Internet-Draft           isis-prefix-attributes             January 2016


   than TE.  The use of router IDs to identify the source of a prefix
   advertisement as defined in the previous section is one such use
   case.  Therefore, whenever the source router ID sub-TLVs defined in
   the previous section are used, the originating router SHOULD also
   advertise the corresponding address-family specific router ID TLV(s).

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the following new sub-TLVs to the registry of sub-
   TLVs for TLVs 135, 235, 236, 237.

   Value: 4 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: Prefix Attribute Flags

   Value: 11 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: IPv4 Source Router ID

   Value: 12 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: IPv6 Source Router ID

   This document also introduces a new registry for bit values in the
   Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV.  Registration policy is Expert Review
   as defined in [RFC5226].  This registry is to be part of the IS-IS
   TLV Codepoints registry.  The name of the registry is "Bit values for
   Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV".  Defined values are:

        Bit #   Name
        -----   ------------------------
        0       External Prefix Flag (X-flag)
        1       Re-advertisement Flag (R-flag)
        2       Node Flag (N-flag)


4.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310].

   Advertisement of the additional information defined in this document
   introduces no new security concerns.
