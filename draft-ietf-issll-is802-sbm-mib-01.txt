Abstract

This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP/SBM server
implementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC
2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control of
the base signaling protocols themselves, as well as some of the
admission control decisions.  These definitions are not intended to be
exhaustive but they have been identified as useful for practical
implementations.

Internet Draft               SBM Parameters                 October 1999


1.  Introduction

SBM server components of the ISSLL/IS802 architecture require some
configuration parameters for operational use.  These fall into 2 main
areas: configuration of RSVP protocol operation and configuration of
SBM-specific parts.  For the former, RFC 2206 and RFC 2213 cover some
configuration operations as SNMP MIBS and some additional objects are
provided here.

This memo includes a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
SNMPv2 SMI [V2SMI].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in an Architecture for
        Describing SNMP Management Frameworks [ARCH].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [V1SMI], STD 16, RFC 1212 [V1CONCISE] and RFC 1215
        [V1TRAPS].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
        STD 58, RFC 2578 [V2SMI], STD 58, RFC 2579 [V2TC] and STD 58,
        RFC 2580 [V2CONFORM].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [V2COMMUNITY] and RFC 1906 [V2TRANS].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC1906
        [V2TRANS], Message Processing and Dispatching [V3MPC] and User-
        based Scurity Model [V3USM].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [V2PROTO].

Internet Draft               SBM Parameters                 October 1999


    o   A set of fundamental applications described in SNMPv3
        Applications [V3APPS] and the view-based access control
        mechanism described in View-based Access Control Model [V3VACM].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [V3INTRO].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


3.  Structure of SBM Server MIB

Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is organized
as a set of related objects. The overall structure is described below.

3.1.  sbmSbmConfigGroup

     This group contains objects for configuration of SBM operation. The
     sbmConfigTable includes the reporting of some hard-coded parameters
     of an SBM implementation and some current state variables. The
     sbmTrafficClassConfigTable controls the admission of RSVP sessions
     into IEEE 802 traffic classes.

3.2.  sbmRsvpConfigGroup

     This group contains objects that control operation of the RSVP
     protocol for each SBM instance. The sbmRsvpConfigTable controls
     behaviour related to policy control on RSVP sessions.

3.3.  sbmSbmStatisticsGroup and sbmSbmHCStatisticsGroup

     These groups contains objects in the sbmStatsTable that represent
     protocol statistics for the RSVP/SBM protocol. The

Internet Draft               SBM Parameters                 October 1999


     sbmSbmHCStatisticsGroup includes objects that only need to be
     implemented for high speed interfaces where 32-bit counters are
     insufficient to represent the values.


3.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

3.4.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

     In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
     systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
     object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
     entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole
     functionality is the SBM protocol or whether this is only a subset
     of the entity's functionality.

3.4.2.  Relation to Interfaces MIB

     The Interface MIB Evolution [INTERFACEMIB], requires that any MIB
     which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas
     within the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left
     vague in the Interface MIB Evolution to avoid over-constraining the
     MIB, thereby precluding management of certain media-types.

3.4.3.  Relation to Integrated Services MIBs

     SBM interfaces which are capable of handling outgoing sessions
     should each be represented by an entry in the per-interface tables
     of this MIB [INTSERVMIB]. <ed: see issue (2) below>.

     SBM interfaces which are capable of handling outgoing Guaranteed
     Service sessions should be represented by an entry in
     intSrvGuaranteedIfTable [INTSERVGSMIB. This entry can be used to
     characterise the delay parameters that the SBM will use in its
     admission control algorithms.

Internet Draft               SBM Parameters                 October 1999


4.1.  Open Issues resolved in this draft


(1)  Should we include DCLASS as well as TCLASS config info here? NO.

(3)  Should we allow creation of new SBM instances? (MIB currently only
     allows configuration of existing SBMs and assumes that the agent
     will create SBM instances appropriately). NO.


4.2.  Other changes in this draft


(4)  Modified descriptive text for tables e.g. sbmConfigTable to
     indicate what entries are expected for what types of SBM. Added new
     variable sbmType to describe whether this SBM instance is for a
     whole subnet, for half-duplex interface (both directions) or full-
     duplex interface (one direction only).

(5)  Added references to IEEE 802.1D traffic classes.

(6)  Added DEFVAL "enabled" for sbmTrafficClassEnabled.

(7)  Added descriptions for stats counters.

(9)  Added sbmDsbmElectionState to report the current DSBM election
     state and sbmDsbmLastStateChange, a timestamp for when it got
     there.

(10)  sbmStatsActiveOutgoingFlows, sbmStatsAllocatedOutgoingBits,
     sbmStatsMaxAllocatedBandwidthBits: changed from Counter32 to
     Gauge32.

(11) Added 64-bit versions of sbmStatsAllocatedOutgoingBits,
     sbmStatsMaxAllocatedBandwidthBits with appropriate conformance
     clauses. These rely on HCRMON's Gauge64 TC.

(12) Merged sbmStatsInPolicyControlFailures and
     sbmStatsOutPolicyControlFailures into
     sbmStatsPolicyControlFailures.

     Miscellaneous editorial fixes.

Internet Draft               SBM Parameters                 October 1999


4.3.  Still Open Issues


(2)  How to represent more detailed e.g. per-queue/per-class
     information. We could use the per-interface tables from
     RFC2213/RFC2214 int-serv MIBs but we would then need one of these
     per queue per interface. this might need ifStackTable to group them
     together. Could also try to use the intSrvflowQueue object for
     this.

(8)  Should counters be zeroed whenever a SBM enters I_AM_DSBM state?
     (Propose: NO)

7.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for
SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can
have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model [V3USM] and the View-based Access Control Model
[V3VACM] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
