Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree            October 2010


Abstract

   A generic VPLS solution for E-Tree services is proposed which uses
   VLANs to indicate root/leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
   is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-
   Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by full mesh tagged PWs, the MAC
   address based Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW works in the same
   way as before. A signaling mechanism for E-Tree capability and VLAN
   mapping notification is further described.

1. Introduction

   E-Tree service is defined in Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) as rooted
   multi-point EVC service, where traffic from a root can reach any root
   or leaf, and traffic from a leaf can reach any root, but should never
   reach a leaf. Although VPMS or P2MP multicast is a somewhat
   simplified version of this service, in fact there is no exact
   corresponding terminology in IETF.

Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree            October 2010


   [Etree-req] gives the requirements to provide E-Tree solutions in the
   VPLS and the need to filter leaf to leaf traffic in the VPLS.

   [vpls-etree] describes a PW control word based E-Tree solution, where
   a bit in the PW control word is used to indicate the root/leaf
   attribute for a packet. The Ethernet forwarder in the VPLS is also
   extended to filter the leaf-leaf traffic based on the <ingress port,
   egress port, CW L-bit> tuple.

   [Etree-2PW] proposes another E-Tree solution where root and leaf
   traffic are classified and forwarded in the same VSI but with two
   separate PWs.

   Both solutions are only applicable to "VPLS only" networks.

   In fact, VPLS PE usually consists of a bridge module itself [RFC4664],
   moreover E-Tree services may cross both Ethernet and VPLS domains.
   Therefore, the support of interconnection between Ethernet and VPLS
   for an E-Tree service is indispensable.

   IEEE 802.1 has incorporated the generic E-Tree solution in the latest
   version of 802.1Q [802.1aq], which is just an improvement on the
   traditional asymmetric VLAN mechanism. In the solution, VLANs are
   used to indicate root/leaf attribute of a packet: one VLAN is used to
   carry traffic originated from the roots and another VLAN is used to
   carry traffic originated from the leaves. The bridge can then filter
   on each leaf port all the traffic received on the VLANs associated
   with the leaves. Thus it is better to use the same mechanism in VPLS
   rather than develop a new mechanism which may not interwork with
   Ethernet.

   This document introduces how the Ethernet VLAN solution can be used
   to support generic E-Tree services in the VPLS. This solution is
   fully compatible with the IEEE bridge architecture and the IETF PWE3
   technology, and VPLS scalability and simplicity is also well kept.
   With this mechanism it is also possible to deploy a converged E-Tree
   service across both Ethernet and MPLS networks.

   As an example, a typical VPLS PE model is firstly introduced and
   extended which consists of a Tree VSI connected to an S-VLAN bridge
   with a dual-VLAN interface. However, this model is applicable to a PE
   with C-VLAN or B-VLAN as its service demarcation's encapsulation.

   This document then discusses the PW encapsulation and PW processing
   such as VLAN mapping options for transporting E-Tree services in a
   VPLS.

   Finally, the extensions needed to support the signaling of E-Tree
   capability and VLAN mapping are also discussed.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Terminology

   Most of the terminology used here is from [IEEE802.1Q], [IEEE802.1ad],
   [RFC4664] and [RFC4762]. Terminology specific to this document is
   introduced as needed in later sections.



4. PE Model with E-Tree Support

   "VPLS only" PE architecture as outlined in Fig. 1 of [Etree-req] is a
   simplification of the PWE3 architecture, the more common VPLS PE
   architectures are discussed in more details in [RFC 4664] and [vpls-
   interop].

   Therefore, VLAN based E-Tree solution are demonstrated with the help
   of a typical VPLS PE model. Other PE models are further discussed in
   Appendix A.

4.1.  Existing PE Models

   According to [RFC4664], there are at least three models possible for
   a VPLS PE, including:

   o  A single bridge module, a single VSI;

   o  A single bridge module, multiple VSIs;

   o  Multiple bridge modules, each attaches to a VSI.

   The second PE model as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 is a typical one
   for VPLS [vpls-interop], where the S-VLAN bridge module is connected
   to multiple VSIs each with a single VLAN interface.

                      Figure 2  VPLS-capable PE Model

   In the PE model above, Ethernet service from the CEs will cross
   multiple stages of bridge modules (i.e., C-VLAN and S-VLAN bridge) in
   a PE to access the egress PWs. Therefore, the association of an AC
   port and a PW in a single forwarding engine as required in [vpls-
   etree] or [Etree-2PW] is difficult, sometimes even impossible.

   This model could be further enhanced by the introduction of a trunk
   VLAN and a branch VLAN as Ethernet frames enter the PE. To be more
   precise, they are called root and leaf VLAN respectively in this
   document. All the traffics from the root VLAN are received both on
   the roots and the leaves, while traffics from the branch VLAN are
   received on the roots and dropped on the leaves. It was demonstrated
   in [802.1aq] that E-Tree on Ethernet could be well supported with
   this mechanism.

   Assume this mechanism is implemented in the bridge module, then it is
   quite straightforward to infer a VPLS PE model with two VSIs (as
   shown in Fig. 3) to support the E-Tree. But this model will require
   two VSIs per PE and two sets of full meshed PWs per E-Tree service,
   which is poorly scalable in a large MPLS/VPLS network.

4.2.  A New PE Model with E-Tree Support

   To provide for the E-Tree support in a more scalable way, a new VPLS
   PE model is proposed and depicted in  Fig. 4, where the S-VLAN bridge
   module is connected to the Tree VSI (T-VSI, a VSI with E-Tree support)
   with a dual-VLAN virtual interface. That is, both the root S-VLAN and
   the leaf S-VLAN are connected to the Tree VSI (T-VSI). In this way,
   only one VPLS instance and one set of PWs is needed per E-Tree
   service. With this model, multiple E-Trees can also be provided by
   the same T-VSI if needed, and further increase the scalability of
   VPLS.

   Both VLANs should share the same FIB and work in shared VLAN learning.
   The traffic from the root UNIs are firstly tagged with root C-VLAN by
   the C-VLAN bridge module, and then tagged with root S-VLAN by the S-
   VLAN bridge module, thus can only be transported on the root S-VLAN.
   Similarly, the traffic from the leaves can only be transported on the
   leaf S-VLAN.

   In fact, this model can also be applied to a PE with C-VLAN (customer
   sites attached to the PEs with untagged ports), or B-VLAN (with a PBB
   bridge module embedded in the PE) as a provider's tag encapsulation.
   Therefore, the document will use the VLAN tag as a generalized form
   in the latter sections.

Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree            October 2010


5. PW for E-Tree Support

   A pair of T-VSIs in a VPLS is interconnected with a bidirectional PW.
   The VLAN indicating root/leaf attribute of the packet is carried in
   the PW, and the peer PE must drop the packet with a leaf VLAN on the
   egress AC of leaf UNI.

   There are three ways of manipulating VLANs for an E-Tree:

   o  Provisioning two global VLANs across both the Ethernet and the
      VPLS instance domain;

   o  Provisioning two local VLANs in the VLAN space for each Ethernet
      domain and two global VLANs in the VPLS network domain, the VLAN
      mapping is done completely in the Ethernet domains (e.g., in the
      bridge module of the PE).

   o  Provisioning two local VLANs independently for each Ethernet
      domain and two local VLANs on each PE for better scalability. That
      is, the assignment of VLANs in the PE may be local to improve the
      scalability.

   The first method is called global VLAN based and no VLAN mapping is
   needed, but two unique VLANs must be allocated in the VPLS for them.
   The second method is called partial global VLAN based, which needs a
   VLAN mapping in the bridge module or in the Ethernet device attached
   to the PE. The last method is called local VLAN based and more
   scalable, but needs a VLAN mechanism in the PW. VLAN mapping is
   elaborated in the following section.

5.1.  VLAN Mapping

   In order to carry both VLANs (root and leaf VLAN) in a single PW and
   map those into the remote peer's VLANs, cares must be taken on both
   the PEs associated with the PW.

   Two options of VLAN mapping are possible:

   o  Local mapping, that is, the remote PE is responsible for mapping
      VLANs into its local VLANs. For the local VLAN based method, VLAN
      mapping is done when a frame exits the PW; for the partial global
      VLAN based method, VLAN mapping is done when a frame exits the
      bridge module.

Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree            October 2010


   o  Remote mapping, that is, the local PE is responsible for mapping
      VLANs into the remote PE's VLANs. For the local VLAN based method,
      VLAN mapping is done when a frame enters the PW; for the partial
      global VLAN based method, VLAN mapping is done when a frame enters
      the bridge module.

   Normally, each PE does its own local mapping. But when a PE is not
   capable of VLAN mapping, remote mapping can be done on its peer.

   If no PE is capable of VLAN mapping, global VLAN based method can be
   used instead.

5.2.  Tagged Mode PW Encapsulation

   For a VPLS instance to support an E-Tree as described above, the
   Ethernet PW should work in the tagged mode (PW type 0x0004) as
   described in [RFC4448], and a C-VLAN, S-VLAN, or B-VLAN tag must be
   carried in each frame in the PW to indicate the E-Tree root/leaf
   attribute.

   For global VLAN based method, it is the global VLAN tag to be carried
   and no VLAN mapping needed in the VPLS.

   For the local VLAN or partial global VLAN based method, either the
   local or the remote VLAN tag could be carried depending on the
   mapping option. In the local mapping mode, the remote VLANs are
   carried with no change, while in the remote mapping mode, the local
   VLANs are carried instead.

   The mapping between the local VLAN and the remote VLAN (local root
   VLAN <-> remote root VLAN; local leaf VLAN <-> remote leaf VLAN)
   should be provisioned by management or signaled by a control protocol
   such as LDP. The signaling extensions for E-Tree support are provided
   in Section 6 and 7.

5.3.  PW Processing

5.3.1.PW Processing in the Normal Mode

   In the normal mode, two VPLS PEs with a T-VSI in each of them are
   inter-connected and both sides are miscellaneously attached with
   roots and leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 5. At the PE where
   a frame exits the PW, if a frame with the remote leaf VLAN is
   received, then it is mapped to the local leaf VLAN, otherwise, if a
   frame with the remote root VLAN is received, then it is mapped to the
   local root VLAN. Packets over both VLANs are processed in the same I-
   VSI and are further forwarded or dropped in the exit bridge module
   using the mechanism as described in 802.1Q.

5.3.2.PW Processing in the Compatibility Mode

   The new VPLS PE model can work in a traditional VPLS network
   seamlessly in the compatibility mode. As shown in Fig. 5, the VPLS PE
   with T-VSI can access both root and leaf node, while the VPLS PE with
   a traditional VSI can only access the root node.

   In this case, the PE with a T-VSI in it must work in the
   compatibility mode, that is, the egress PW of the T-VSI must
   translate frames received over both local root and leaf VLAN into a
   PW with a single VLAN (i.e., local root VLAN if the peer is capable
   of rewriting the VLAN, or the remote peer's VLAN otherwise), while
   the ingress PW only translates the frames received over the PW into
   the local root VLAN.

5.3.3.PW Processing in the Optimization Mode

   When two VPLS PE with T-VSI are inter-connected and one side is
   attached with pure leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 6, the
   egress PW of the miscellaneous attached PE then should work in the
   optimization mode, that is, the PE can drop all the frames received
   over the local leaf VLAN rather than transport them over the PW and
   be discarded on the remote PE. Thus bandwidth efficiency of the VPLS
   can be improved.

6. LDP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   To dynamically provision the E-Tree service using the signaling
   procedures specified in [RFC4447], an E-Tree specific interface
   parameter sub-TLV is proposed as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  E-Tree       |   Length=8    |           Reserved        |P|R|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Root VLAN ID         |          Leaf VLAN ID         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                         Figure 8  E-Tree Sub-TLV

   Where:

   o  E-Tree is the sub-TLV identifier to be assigned by IANA.

   o  Length is the length of the sub TLV in octets.

   o  Reserved bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored on
      receive.

   o  P is a Pure Leaf bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
      attached with all leaves, and set to 0 otherwise.

   o  R is a request bit of Remote VLAN Translation. If a PE is capable
      of translating VLANs, then set R to 0, otherwise set R to 1. If a
      PE receives R=1 from its peer, then it must do VLAN translation
      for this peer, otherwise local mapping rule applies.

   o  Root VLAN ID is the value of the local root VLAN.

   o  Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN.

   When the VPLS supporting an E-Tree service is setting up the PW, the
   PW endpoints negotiate the E-Tree support using the above E-Tree sub-
   TLV. Note PW type of 0x0004 should be used during the PW negotiation.

   A PE that wishes to support E-Tree service includes an E-Tree Sub-TLV
   in its PW label mapping message, together with its local root VLAN
   and leaf VLAN carried in the Root VLAN ID and Leaf VLAN ID field
   respectively.  A PE that has E-Tree capability and willing to support
   it MUST include an E-Tree Sub-TLV with its own local root VLAN and
   leaf VLAN. A PE that is incapable of translating VLANs MUST set the R
   bit to 1, while a PE that is capable of translating VLANs MAY set the

Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree            October 2010


   R bit to 1 to indicate remote mapping is preferred. And a PE is
   attached with pure leaves SHOULD set the P bit to 1.

   If a PE incapable of VLAN mapping has received an E-Tree Sub-TLV with
   the bit "R" set, and either the root VLAN ID or the leaf VLAN ID in
   the message does not match the local root VLAN or the local leaf VLAN,
   then the PW should not be set up and a label release message with the
   error code "E-Tree VLAN mapping not supported" must be sent.

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV and has received an E-Tree Sub-TLV,
   then it must work as described in Section 5.3.1. If the bit "L" is
   set, then it should work as described in Section 5.3.3.

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV and does not receive an E-Tree
   Sub-TLV, then it must work in the mode of compatibility as described
   in Section 5.3.2.

7. BGP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   BGP may also be used to distribute the E-Tree and VLAN mapping
   information. It is to be specified in the next version.

8. Applicability

   The solution is applicable to LDP VPLS [RFC4762] and may also be
   applicable to BGP VPLS [RFC 4761].

   The solution is applicable to both "VPLS Only" network and VPLS with
   Ethernet aggregation network.

9. Security Considerations

   To be added in the next version.

10.   IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for E-Tree in the Pseudowire
   Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type registry.

   Parameter ID   Length       Description
   =======================================
   TBD            8            E-Tree

Appendix A. Other PE Models for E-Tree

A.1. PE Model With a VSI and No bridge

   If there is no bridge module in a PE, the PE may consist of Native
   Service Processors (NSPs) as shown in Figure A.1 (adapted from Fig. 5
   of [RFC3985]) which may apply any transformation operation for VLANs
   (e.g., VLAN insertion/removal or VLAN mapping). Thus a root VLAN or
   leaf VLAN is added by the NSP depending on the UNI type of the AC
   over which the packet arrives.

   Further, when a packet with a leaf VLAN exits a forwarder and arrives
   at the NSP, the NSP must drop the packet if the egress AC is a leaf
   UNI.

   Tagged PW and VLAN mapping work in the same way as in the typical PE
   model.
