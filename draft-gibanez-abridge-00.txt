         Abstract  
          
           Rbridges are link layer devices that use routing protocols as a control 
           plane but do not target to scale up to large campus networks. This 
           document contains an alternative proposal to link-state Rbridges, named 
           Abridges. Abridges overcome Rbridges L2 network size restrictions 
           allowing applicability to very large Ethernet campus networks while 
           maintaining zero configuration and high performance, by assuming a 
           topological restriction that is automatically performed. The proposal 
           includes a two-layered network architecture with two hierarchical 
           independent spanning tree layers. Expected convergence is fast, probably 
           below two seconds.   
            
           Abridges use multiple simplified spanning trees rooted at core edge 
           bridges  to  achieve  results  comparable  to  Rbridges  with  lower 
           computational complexity. Two implementation variants of simplified 
           multiple spanning trees are proposed: The first one is a fundamental 
           simplification of the standard Multiple Spanning Tree protocol and the 
           second one (still in a very preliminary stage) consists of an N-multiple 
           simultaneous execution of the Rapid Spanning Tree protocol at each 
           Rbridge. 
           An optional mechanism of ARP/Abridge servers/registrars (with load 
           splitting) is proposed to limit ARP traffic in large scale Ethernet 
           networks and to enhance scalability and security. This mechanism can also 
           be used for host-Designated Rbridge resolution as an alternative to the 
           interchange of Hosts Lists between Rbridges.

         1. Introduction 
          
           Current IP-based campus networks use one prefix address per link to 
           support routing. This implies administration and configuration of IP 
           addresses. IP addresses are link-related, so the IP address of an end 
           node varies when the point of attachment to the network changes.  
           Bridges do not require this kind of configuration because they forward in 
           the switched domain using flat layer 2 addresses. However standard bridge 
           protocols do not scale, because the spanning tree protocol only enables 
           some selected links to prevent loops, and network utilization is 
           therefore low. Also the routes along the spanning tree are not pair-wise 
           shortest paths, and temporary loops may produce packet proliferation 
           across the entire switched domain.  
            
           Rbridges have been proposed as a hybrid of routers and bridges, showing 
           the advantages of routers while preserving at the same time the zero 
           configuration capability of bridges. 
           However Rbridges currently do not fulfil an important requirement such as 
           scaling to large Ethernet campus networks. The importance of this 
           requirement is growing with the increasing size of campus networks and 
           the foreseeable increase in connected devices (displays, IP phones, 
           cameras, 802.11 PDAs, sensors, etc). This lack of scalability derives 
           from the use of flat MAC addresses to perform routing. Being non 
           aggregatable, MAC addresses will produce long tables in Rbridges when 
           used in large campus networks. Another potential weakness of Rbridges is 
           that, while exhibiting unrestricted topological compatibility with 
           standard bridges, Rbridges depend on the bridged links to communicate

           among themselves and to perform the IS-IS Designated Router election. 
           This dependency increases their complexity and makes the whole system 
           vulnerable to inter Rbridge communication problems. The overall 
           convergence time is increased because the spanning tree convergence time 
           adds up to the IS-IS DR election time.  
               
           This draft proposes an architecture for Ethernet campus networks based on 
           a new type of Ethernet hierarchical switches for campus cores. The 
           architecture  is  oriented  to  provide  high  performance,  minimal 
           configuration, and scalability in very large Ethernet campus networks. 
           The proposed network architecture consists of a high capacity core 
           composed of an arbitrary mesh of switches named Abridges, and a number of 
           access networks with standard bridges connected to the core.  
            
           The document proposes an alternative implementation for Rbridges [10] 
           (Routing Bridges), identified as AMSTP Bridges (Abridges) that combine 
           the advantages of bridges and routers. Like bridges and Rbridges, 
           Abridges require zero configuration and are transparent to IP nodes. 
           Abridges also forward on pair-wise shortest paths like routers as 
           Rbridges do.  
            
           We propose to use multiple L2 spanning trees between Abridges to forward 
           via shortest paths in the core of the campus network. The AMSTP protocol 
           is a simplification of the standard MSTP protocol, oriented to zero 
           configuration. The core edge bridges provide backbone connectivity to 
           lower layer (Access Layer) networks. The active topology of the Access 
           Layer networks consists of standard spanning trees of switches 
           (RSTP/STP). Each Edge Switch acts as the root bridge of two independent 
           spanning trees: the spanning tree of its lower layer Access network, and 
           one spanning tree instance of the core network. The architecture provides 
           shortest paths in most traffic situations for client-server traffic (for 
           servers located in a server farm) and adapts well to traffic aggregation. 
           Additional mechanisms can be designed to achieve  high network 
           availability.   
            
           Due to the access port mode, Abridges are compatible with current bridges 
           as well as current IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as 
           transparent to current IP routers as bridges and Rbridges are. Like 
           routers, they terminate a bridged spanning tree.  
             
           Packets in the Core of Abridges must be encapsulated such that:  
            
           - Forwarding is performed in the Core across per egress bridge tree 
           instances, while maintaining the original L2 header so that end 
           destination bridges can learn about the location of the source by 
           learning the source address from packets. 
            
           - Abridges can learn the location of end nodes. They can learn the 
           location and layer 2 addresses of attached nodes from the source address 
           of data packets, as bridges and Rbridges. However, very large campus 
           networks with tens of thousands of nodes may require more scalable and 
           safer solutions for locating  end nodes. For this case, the use of 
           ARP/Abriges Server/Registrars is proposed. 
            
           Support of VLANs traditionally requires configuration of the bridges to 
           know which ports and links belong to which VLANs. In order to achieve 
           true  zero configuration, we recommend that bridges do not separate per 
           VLAN traffic in the campus core, and do not use a separate spanning tree 
           for each  broadcast domain. In a campus without VLANs, this means a 
           single spanning tree would be used for delivery of packets with unknown 
           or layer 2 group address layer 2 destinations. 
            
           Abridges can suppress the broadcast/multicast for Neighbour discovery by 
           using ARP servers/registrars or, similarly to Rbridges, by conventional 
           proxy ARP (IPv4) or proxy ND (IPv6).

         3. Network Architecture 
          
           Campus network designs are currently based on a layered architecture 
           (core, distribution and access layers) to obtain network scalability and 
           predictability. Segmentation of networks is obtained using routers or 
           devices called multilayer switches that segment the network in IP 
           segments or subnets. 
            
           A similar approach is proposed here, but with the network segmentation 
           performed at layer 2 instead of layer 3. The proposed network 
           architecture is shown in Figure 1. It uses a two-layer hierarchical L2 
           network to achieve scalability to large scale Ethernet networks. The 
           upper layer acts as a Core-Distribution Layer (Core) and the lower Layer 
           acts as an Access Layer. The core layer uses the AMSTP protocol for 
           interconnection between core Abridges while the Access Layer uses the 
           standard spanning tree protocol (RSTP or STP) to connect hosts of the 
           access network with other hosts via their root bridge at the core 
           (Abridge).  
            
           The Abridges constitute the core network and are interconnected by 
           dedicated links. The point to point link requirement derives from the 
           need for fast convergence of standard layer 2 spanning tree algorithms, 
           but it is also required for high performance and enhanced security

           (802.1X). Thus, point to point links are becoming a requirement for 
           Ethernet networks, at least at the core and distribution layers.  
           Other bridges connect to Abridges without requiring a point to point 
           connection, and form the Access Layer. The Access Layer is segmented in 
           multiple access networks. Each Access network is formed by devices 
           connected to a core Abridge; it may have arbitrary topologies but the 
           active topology will use the standard spanning tree as the basic 
           forwarding mechanism. More sophisticated protocols are possible for 
           better infrastructure usage inside each Access network, but they are out 
           of the scope of this proposal.

           Abridges must auto-configure ports to participate in the Core or in the 
           Access  network. The port reconfiguring mechanism is as follows: a port 
           that is not connected using a point to point link to another Abridge 
           configures itself as an access port (an ingress and egress point for 
           traffic to/from the core). Ports directly connected to another Abridge 
           act as core ports. The auto-configuration of ports works as follows: each 
           port detects, through the STP BPDU type (STP, RSTP or AMSTP) received on 
           their link upon initialization, whether the device connected to the link 
           is a standard bridge or an Abridge. If the BPDUs received are standard 
           802.1D BPDUs, the link will be assigned to the Access Network and the 
           port will be automatically configured to access port mode. Any standard 
           bridge connected to the Abridge is thus automatically excluded from the 
           core function.  
            
           Figure 1 shows an example of the proposed network topology. A core of 
           Abridges constitutes the campus backbone and interconnects different area 
           networks formed by standard 802.1D bridges. 
           
         4. Protocols  
          
           In this section the proposed protocols are described. The Alternative 
           Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol [7] is an evolution of the standard MSTP 
           [6] and RSTP [3] protocols. In the following paragraphs RSTP and MSTP 
           protocols are first summarily introduced to provide the required context 
           to describe the AMSTP protocol. Differences between AMSTP and MSTP are 
           summarized after a description of AMSTP.  
            
         4.1 RSTP Protocol 
          
           A standard protocol for bridges is the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol, 
           included in IEEE 802.1D[5]. It provides much faster convergence than the

           previous standard protocol STP [4]. To achieve convergence in (typically) 
           fractions of one second, RSTP substitutes the timer based mechanism that 
           STP uses, to ensure that the algorithm has converged with a locally 
           controlled proposal-agreement mechanism between adjacent switches to 
           transition the port states to forwarding in a controlled way. This 
           mechanism requires point to point links to operate without loops. Other 
           mechanisms are also used to ensure rapid convergence.  
          
         4.2 MSTP protocol 
          
           The Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1Q) is based on RSTP (IEEE 
           802.1D) and creates different tree instances that are used by sets of 
           VLANs according to the configuration of the bridge. MSTP implements a set 
           of multiple and independent spanning tree instances (MSTI) in a network 
           region. Each region is interconnected via a common spanning tree (CST) to 
           other MST regions. Inside a region, several VLANs can be mapped to a 
           single tree instance. Multiple tree instances at each region make it 
           possible to improve the usage of the links. At each region, there is a 
           tree instance (IST), identified with the number 0, that acts as the basic 
           spanning tree. The CIST or total spanning tree is comprised of the CST 
           that connects all the regions, and the IST that provides connectivity 
           inside each region. It allows separated management of the regions, 
           appearing to the outside as a unique and separate superbridge, i.e. the 
           whole region connects to the CST via one Regional Root Bridge port and a 
           number of designated ports like a single bridge. Therefore, no change in 
           internal topology inside is influenced by outside tree topology changes. 
           MSTP allows more efficient network infrastructure usage by assigning 
           different spanning trees to different sets of VLANs. 
           But MSTP is complex to configure. Tree instances must be planned and 
           VLANs must be mapped to those tree instances. The configuration table 
           must be checked to be exactly the same for all bridges of the same 
           region. Serious malfunction occurs if VLAN mapping discrepancies between 
           bridges in the same region exist.  
            
          
         4.3 Core layer: AMSTP Protocol  
          
           In the architecture proposed, the AMSTP Protocol works as a Core Layer 
           protocol providing shortest path interconnection between Access Networks 
           and providing network segmentation to prevent the extension of failures 
           to the whole switched domain. The AMSTP Protocol has been proposed 
           previously [AMSTP] for metropolitan Ethernet backbones but it can be 
           extended for campus networks as well, with some modifications. AMSTP is a 
           simplified multiple spanning tree protocol that uses one tree instance 
           rooted at each edge bridge in the core to forward frames. A complete 
           multi-tree is the set of all tree instances, one rooted at every edge 
           bridge that interconnects all bridges in the backbone. Only the Abridge 
           ports connected to other Abridges participate in the multiple spanning 
           tree protocol. The rest of the ports participate in the standard spanning 
           tree protocols such as RSTP or STP (IEEE 802.1D).  
           To describe the AMSTP protocol, we consider its two main functionalities: 
           building and maintaining the spanning trees (control plane), and 
           processing and forwarding frames in the bridges (user plane).  
          
          
         4.3.1   Building the Trees 
          
            The process of tree building consists of two parts: building the basic 
           (standard) RSTP tree and building the rest of the instances, called 
           Alternate Multiple Spanning Tree Instances (AMSTI), till one tree 
           instance per bridge is built as shown in figure 2. The process of 
           building the main tree is the same as in RSTP. 
           Every bridge emits autonomously Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) every 
           Hello Time (configurable from milliseconds) to neighbouring bridges. 
           First the Bridge having the lowest Bridge ID (best configured priority 
           plus lower MAC address appended) is elected as Root Bridge of the main

           spanning tree. Every bridge receiving BPDU from this Bridge will adopt it 
           as Root and propagate it in the BPDUs emitted.  
            
           These BPDUs contain the minimum path cost from the emitting bridge to the 
           elected Root Bridge. Every Bridge attaches to the spanning tree by 
           selecting the port that is receiving the best BPDU as the root port. 
           The best BPDU is the one that announces minimum path cost to root bridge. 
           Each bridge builds its own BPDU with the result of received BPDUs from 
           other bridges, selecting superior BPDUs according to the standard STP 
           criteria (lower Bridge ID, lower path cost, lower port priority, lower 
           port ID) and transmits them via the main tree for the continuous 
           maintenance of the optimum main spanning tree.

         Fig.2. A five node network and its five self-rooted AMSTP Spanning Tree 
         Instances (R: root bridge). 
          
         The process of building all the other tree instances, one per tree, takes 
         place as follows: Each Core Bridge appends to the main tree BPDU the 
         information of all AMSTI tree instances which the bridges participates in. 
         The information appended per tree instance is called the AM-Record and 
         contains similar information for BPDU tree instance building. The key 
         difference with other spanning tree protocols is that there is no bridge 
         election. In AMSTP the Abridge claims itself as Tree Root Bridge of its own 
         instance and accepts equally every other Abridge as the Root of its own 
         instance. The bridge is accepted as the root by other bridges without 
         negotiation (except when a malfunction is detected). This self rooted tree 
         instance is identified by the bridge ID of the edge Abridge (root). The 
         rest of the process is analogous to the building of the MSTI tree instances 
         used by MSTP inside an MST region [4]: the tree is built by selecting tree 
         paths at every bridge according to the same minimum path cost criteria as 
         MSTP, using port priority and port ID for tie breaking. A flag octet, 
         identical to the one for building the basic tree instance, is used by the 
         bridges to communicate and negotiate transitions of port states and roles 
         per tree instance. 
          
         4.3.2   Frame processing in Core Switches 
          
         When processing a frame, a Core Switch (Abridge) may act as an ingress, 
         transit or egress Abridge.  
          
         As ingress Abridge, the switch encapsulates the frame with an additional 
         Layer 2 header containing its MAC as source address, and as destination the 
         MAC address of the egress Abridge. The ingress Abridge forwards the 
         encapsulated frame through the branch belonging to the spanning tree 
         instance rooted at the egress Abridge. This path is a pair-wise shortest 
         path because the tree is built by minimizing path cost from each root to 
         the rest of the nodes.  
          
         Traffic forwarding in the core depends on the traffic type: broadcast, 
         multicast and traffic to unknown destinations is forwarded via the tree 
         instance rooted at the ingress Abridge. Unicast traffic (to a known 
         Abridge) is forwarded through the tree instance of the egress Abridge. 
         Forwarding takes place by sending the frame through the bridge root port.

         Broadcast and multicast traffic are forwarded via the tree instance rooted 
         at the ingress Abridge.    
          
         Abridges may learn from the received frames both the MAC addresses of other 
         Abridges and the MACs of the connected end nodes by the inspection of the 
         inner and outer Ethernet MAC addresses of the encapsulated frames. This 
         learning process is called double MAC learning and is applicable only in 
         networks with a moderate number of end nodes, like a backbone with routers 
         connected to it [AMSTP].   
          
         The MAC learning process is based on frames broadcasted over the switched 
         network. These broadcasts are commonly ARP packets issued by end nodes for 
         layer 2 destination address resolution. In this process the bridges learn 
         the originating MAC at receiving ports and the hosts add the IP-MAC pair to 
         their ARP table. In networks with a high number of end nodes, processing a 
         high number of ARP requests by every endnode may result in significant load 
         for endnodes. A different mechanism is needed to prevent ARP packets from 
         broadcasting/multicasting in large Ethernet campus networks.    
          
         The ports of switches that are not connected to AMSTP capable Core Switches 
         do not run AMSTP, so they are kept out of the core forwarding mechanism. 
         For Core Switches running AMSTP to interoperate with legacy switches 
         running STP or RSTP, a mechanism is needed, like the standard port 
         migration protocol used by MSTP, RSTP and STP. Basically the mechanism is 
         that if a port of an MSTP switch receives BPDUs of protocol version 0 (STP 
         protocol) it will emit STP BPDUs only. Recovery is not automatic; the port 
         will not emit MSTP BPDUs until a configuration command restarts the 
         protocol migration process, forcing renegotiation between neighbouring 
         switches.   
          
         4.3.3   AMSTP BPDU layout 
          
         AMSTP BPDUs have a structure that resembles MSTP BPDUs [4] since both are 
         comprised essentially of a basic BPDU and several AM-Records appended. The 
         AMSTP BPDU structure is shown in figure 3. The basic BPDU is used for basic 
         tree (0) negotiation between switches. Each of the appended AM-Records is 
         used to negotiate a specific tree instance (AMSTI).  
         As in the MSTP case the BPDUs carrying the rapid spanning tree information 
         distributed via instance 0 also carry the information of all the spanning 
         tree instances appended to the RSTP BPDU as AM records. This reduces 
         broadcasting and simplifies BPDU processing at the switches.

         Every AM-record includes an octet flag identical to the one described for 
         the RSTP tree. These flags are used to negotiate all transitions of each 
         tree instance between connected ports of neighbouring switches.   
         Minimum configuration is an important requirement for Core Switches. While 
         multiple spanning tree algorithms enable much better usage of the existing 
         infrastructure, they are usually complex to configure because a way to 
         assign frames to tree instances is needed. In the case of MSTP, this means 
         that the mapping of VLANs to tree instances (MSTIs) has to be configured 
         manually at each bridge, resulting in a complex and error-prone process. 
          AMSTP uses Self rooted Spanning Tree instances instead of VLAN mapped 
         trees and all tree instances are automatically created, so no tree 
         configuration is needed. The parameters to configure are those common to 
         RSTP, such as selection of the Root Bridge and configuration of the Backup 
         Bridges for the region and their priorities.  
          
         Multicast (L2 addresses) traffic. Multicast traffic in the campus core is 
         forwarded via same tree instances as unicast traffic, via pair-wise 
         shortest paths to destination Abridges. The difference with unicast traffic 
         is that the spanning tree used is rooted at the ingress Abridge, instead of 
         the tree rooted at the destination Abridge. The multicast trees are 
         therefore always optimized for minimum hops without the construction of 
         additional tree instances. As for Rbridges, Abridges may treat multicast 
         traffic as broadcast or may use current techniques like IGMP snooping to 
         limit broadcast.

         MSTP and AMSTP. The first difference is the criteria used for assignment of 
         frames to a tree instance for processing, in other words, how the bridge 
         knows which spanning tree instance to use to forward the frame. The second

         4.5 Designated (and Root) Abridge  
          
         Similarly to Rbridges, an Abridge of each link has special duties. This 
         Abridge acts as the Designated Rbridge of that link. The DR function 
         combines very well with being the root bridge of the spanning tree of that 
         link. To achieve automatic election of Abridges as roots of the respective 
         access networks of the campus it would suffice that the default bridge ID 
         of Abridges have a lower value than that of standard bridges (midrange). An 
         Abridge may in this way become the root bridge of any link. DR election and 
         root bridge election are one and the same operation, performed according to 
         the standard procedure [5]. In this way DR election does not depend on any 
         external mechanism and convergence time at links does not add up to the 
         convergence time of DR election at IS-IS as in the Rbridge case. The 
         complete DR election process is avoided.  
          
         4.6 Forwarding scenario 
          
         Now the basic forwarding scenario is described. Figure 4 shows two hosts H1 
         and H2 connected at different access networks. First the ARP and 
         destination Abridge resolution are described, and then the forwarding 
         process.  
          
         4.6.1 ARP and Abridge Resolution 
          
         Using  ARP  servers  is  the  optional  mechanism  proposed  to  limit 
         broadcast/multicast traffic. However, the standard ARP mechanism must be 
         kept to ensure that hosts that silently move from one part of the campus to 
         another can be located.  
          
         Besides ARP for host resolution, the servers may also be used for 
         resolution of the destination Abridge. Each server stores a table with 
         tuples containing the IP, L2 address of the end node and L2 address of the 
         Designated Bridge (Root Abridge). The set of stored tuples corresponds to 
         IP addresses that produce identical (few bits) hash results of IP 
         destination end node.  
          
         The sequence for communication between H1 and H2 at figure 4 is as follows: 
         Host H1 first sends a broadcast ARP packet to get the resolution of host 
         H2s L2 address. The packet is distributed through the spanning tree of the 
         access network and arrives at the root Abridge. The root Abridge detects 
         the ARP, calculates hash(IP destination address) and with the result 
         obtains the server responsible for that IP address. The server performs a 
         look up using H2s IP destination address and obtains the H2 L2 address and 
         the (egress) Abridge ID of that access network, then sends the reply in a 
         packet to the ingress Abridge. The Abridge extracts the information and 
         forwards a standard ARP response packet to host H1. Host H1 can then 
         proceed to send packets with the L2 address of host H2. The ingress Abridge 
         also registers the originating host by sending a registration packet 
         containing the ARP packet to the corresponding ARP/Abridge server, obtained 
         by computing hash(IP origin).

         Note: If the destination host is connected to the same access network, the 
         host will reply directly by emitting an ARP response packet.  
          
         Note: The Abridge registers a host at the corresponding ARP 
         Server/Registrar whenever it detects a frame from an unknown host connected 
         at its access network. 
          
         4.6.2 Forwarding 
          
         The frame forwarding process is as follows: the standard frame sent by host 
         (IP(H2), L2(H2)) arrives to the Access network root bridge (Abridge). Its 
         DA Ethernet Address contains the end node destination address. The root 
         Abridge (Designated) looks at its cache for the ID of the destination end 
         nodes designated Abridge (that was filled just before with the ARP/Abridge 
         server response). The Abridge still has in its cache the pair (L2 address, 
         L2 egress Abridge) obtained before and encapsulates the frame with a header 
         like this: (DA egress Abridge, SA ingress Abridge, Ethertype: AMSTP). It 
         then determines the applicable tree instance by looking at the destination 
         Abridge and forwards it through the port that was elected root for the 
         Abridge destination instance. The packet arrives at the Designated Port of 
         the next Abridge, which then inspects it and forwards it to the outer 
         destination MAC address using the corresponding tree instance to obtain the 
         root port of that instance. The packet is forwarded again via the root port 
         till the egress Abridge is reached. The egress Abridge detects that it is 
         the destination of the frame, removes the encapsulation header of the frame 
         and forwards the original frame via the access port where the L2 host has 
         been learnt or via all access ports if H2 is unknown. The packet goes from 
         the egress bridge (root) to H2 following a branch of the tree rooted at the 
         egress bridge. Frame forwarding in the access networks is performed in the 
         standard way with the spanning tree set up by STP or RSTP. A packet exiting 
         the Abridge by an access port must look to ordinary bridges like an 
         ordinary layer 2 packet and must not be encapsulated.  
          
         The Abridge may learn the destination Abridge by host list interchange. The 
         forwarding behaviour of Rbridges is as follows: When a DR R1 receives a 
         native packet with layer 2 address S and layer 2 destination address D, R1 
         looks up the location of D. If D is claimed by egress Rbridge R2, then R1 
         encapsulates the packet, directing it towards R2. Abridges may use the 
         same behaviour, but in this case network size might not scale to one 
         hundred thousand end nodes--the Campus Transit Tables (CTT) would be too 
         big.  
          
         In contrast to an Rbridge, when an Abridge receives an encapsulated packet, 
         it forwards it based on the DA Abridge and does not change the DA for the 
         next-hop address. The next hop is selected by forwarding the frame via 
         the root port of tree instance rooted at the destination Abridge. A packet 
         in the core must look like an Ethernet frame, but must be differentiable 
         from a native layer 2 packet by Abridges. To accomplish this, a new layer 2 
         protocol type ("Ethertype") is used. 
          
         4.7 Learning End node Location 
           
         Abridges learn end node location in access ports as standard bridges do. 
         Abridges learn root bridge IDs of the multiple instances of core from AMSTP 
         BPDUs received. 
          
         Similarly to Rbridges, the Core (Edge) Abridge, acting as root and 
         Designated Rbridge, might work in two modes: 
            - As a standard Designated Rbridge, that learns the L2 addresses of 
              attached end nodes, initiates a distributed ARP when an ARP query is 
              received for an unknown destination, and answers ARP queries when the 
              target node is known. This mechanism is an alternative to the use of 
              ARP Servers/Registrars 
            - From data packets. They learn (layer 3, layer 2) pairs (for the 
              purpose of supporting proxy ARP/ND) from listening to ARP or ND 
              replies.

         4.8 Routing in Abridges vs Learning Bridges Addresses 
          
         Some recent proposals like Shortest Path Bridging (SPB), as proposed at the 
         IEEE [12][13], use also multiple tree instances rooted at edge bridges. 
         However it presents the problem of asymmetrical spanning trees. This 
         happens when the tree rooted at bridge A differs in chosen path A-B from 
         the path chosen by the tree rooted at B to A. The problem occurs when there 
         are ties in the path costs of tree instances. In the instance with node A 
         as root the tie may be solved by choosing one path. In the instance with 
         node B as root the tie may be solved choosing a different path. But the 
         spanning trees must be symmetrical for the address learning to work 
         correctly: the address learnt at one port of B sent by A (via spanning tree 
         A to B), if forwarded via same port through the opposite direction spanning 
         tree (B to A) might find the path blocked due to a different root port 
         election at A for the tree instance rooted at B.  
          
         Abridges work differently because they do not learn addresses. Abridges 
         only build spanning trees and assign traffic to them according to the 
         destination Abridge. AMSTP uses always the root port to send frames to the 
         destination bridge (instance rooted at destination), so the routing 
         function for Abridge is as follows: 
            - The bridge ID of the destination corresponding to the destination end 
              node is obtained from the Abridge Server. 
            - The bridge ID of the destination is translated to the port MAC 
              destination address of the destination Abridge at the internal 
              Abridge table. 
            - The frame is encapsulated with an external L2 header with  
              Destination Bridge ID. 
            - Abridges only forward a frame received at a designated port, 
              upstream, via the root port. The L2 external destination address can 
              be the Destination Bridge ID itself. When the encapsulated frame 
              arrives at the destination bridge, it must identify its Bridge ID in 
              the DA and remove the L2 encapsulation of the frame and forward it 
              downstream to the access network via access port(s).    
          
         4.9 Header on 802 Links  
          
           Abridges, as Rbridges, must coexist with ordinary bridges. The 
           encapsulated L2 format must be compatible with the Ethernet format. No 
           additional fields like TTL are required if the fast convergence mechanism 
           procedure of RSTP is used.      
          
           An encapsulated packet would look as follows:  
          
                         +--------------+----------------+---- 
                         | outer header |original packet |CRC| 
                         +--------------+----------------+---- 
              
                                Figure 5 Encapsulated packet  
          
            The outer header contains:  
          
            o L2 destination = destination (egress) Abridge  
          
            o L2 source = origin (ingress) Abridge  
          
            o protocol type = "to be assigned...Abridge encapsulated packet" (AMSTP) 
             
         4.10 Distributed ARP Query  
             
           Abridges may perform distributed ARP Query as Rbridges do, but for large   
           campus networks, it is recommended the use of ARP/Abridge servers/ 
           registrars to reduce multicast traffic and processing load at end nodes.

           Each ABridge needs a unique ID within the campus.  The simplest such   
           address is a unique 6-byte ID, since such an ID is easily obtainable as 
           any of the EUI-48's owned by that Abridge.   
          
           A new Ethertype must be assigned to indicate an Abridge-encapsulated   
           packet.  
          
           A layer 2 multicast address is used as the all Abridges" destination 
           address in distributed ARP queries and any other intercommunication 
           message. 
            
           An optional layer 2 multicast address is needed to address to all 
           ARB/Abridge servers (if used), to communicate among them the available 
           servers and the hash value(s) supported. 
            
           The AMSTP protocol distributes BPDUs addressed to the local multicast 
           protocol addresses used by the spanning tree protocol (Bridge Group 
           Address 01-80-C2-00-00-00). These addresses are neither forwarded by 
           bridges nor by Rbridges or Abridges.  
            
         5. ARP/Abridge Servers/Registrars   
            
           Abridges, as Rbridges, may suppress the broadcast/multicast for neighbour 
           discovery by doing proxy ARP (IPv4) or proxy ND (IPv6). However the 
           mechanism  proposed  for  large  campus  networks  to  suppress 
           broadcast/multicast  for  neighbour  discovery  consists  of  ARP 
           servers/registrars, where end nodes are registered upon frame detection 
           by the Designated Abridge. 
          
           Although all ARP/Abridge servers might work in parallel, it seems more 
           efficient to perform statistical uniform load distribution between 
           servers, distributing the IP addresses to resolve among the available 
           servers by a hashing based mechanism. The process is as follows: When a 
           host issues an ARP packet, the packet is forwarded up across the spanning 
           tree of the access network up to the root bridge (Abridge). The Abridge, 
           acting as Designated Abridge, performs hashing of the destination IP. 
           With this hash result the Abridge obtains the ARP/Abridge server ID in 
           charge of that IP address. This server ID was previously obtained from   
           announcement packets from ARP servers containing its IP address, L2 
           address, server ID and hash values that it serves.  
           The Abridge encapsulates the ARP packet originated by endnode with an 
           additional L2 header with the destination address of the corresponding 
           server for ARP resolution.  
           The Abridge also prepares a registering packet with the IP origin in 
           order to register (or refresh) the host originating the ARP into the 
           corresponding ARP/Abridge server. 
            
           To avoid redundant load on ARP/Abridge servers, they must share the load 
           by assigning server IDs according to the result of hash (IP destination). 
           The total number of servers may be dimensioned according to the length of 
           the hash results used or by additional grouping. An additional protocol 
           between ARP/Abridge servers can be designed to handle dynamic load 
           splitting among the available servers/registrars as they come into and 
           out of service. A server coming into service takes charge of a hash value 
           handed out by a running server. The new server performs the new 
           registrations, and forwards unsolved requests to the previous server.  
           After the expiration time of the first registration performed at new 
           server is reached, the handover process is complete as no valid 
           registries remain in previous server.      
          
         6. Issues

           Per Ingress multicast spanning Tree is implemented by default with

           Shortest Path Bridging [SPB], the current proposal at IEEE for pair-wise 
           shortest path, depends on symmetrical tree instances between bridges 
           pairs for the L2 addresses learning to work properly. In case of a path 
           cost tie during tree instances calculation, different paths might be 
           elected in opposite directions. The proposal at [13] describes a change 
           in MSTP Protocol to prevent this, but convergence times increase. 
            
           Abridges are not subject to this problem because they forward unicast 
           traffic through one branch of the destination Abridge tree instance. 
           Packets are forwarded in Abridges via its port elected as the root of the 
           destination Abridge tree instance. Unicast forwarding in the core campus 
           always follows the path from Designated Port to root port at each Abridge 
           traversed till reaching the destination. No address learning is used for 
           filtering as the packet is always forwarded via one port (root port of 
           Abridge). 
            
          6.3 Traffic Aggregation at Root. 
            
           A usual argument against spanning trees is that the traffic accumulates 
           near the root bridge, provoking congestion. The real situation in campus 
           networks is that traffic, predominantly client-server, distributes in a 
           tree form. However, bridge design and Ethernet technologies with their 
           various speeds (100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps) currently make efficient 
           switch designs possible (like N*100 Mbps with two 1 Gbps uplinks) that 
           aggregate traffic efficiently.  
           
          6.4 VLANs 
            
           VLAN usage in campus core requires detailed configuration of which 
           Abridge port belongs to which VLAN.  
            
           Abridges may learn, as VLAN aware bridges, which port belongs to which 
           VLAN by inspecting the incoming VLAN tagged frames. This may help 
           simplify VLAN configuration in Abridges but does not eliminate the need 
           to configure VLANs in campus networks: Tagged VLAN frames must be 
           generated either by manually configured bridges or by hosts originating 
           the frames. In the hosts case, a system to assign a VLAN to each host 
           must be set up via a dynamic VLAN server that requires configuration. 
            
           VLANs are used to separate broadcast domains. Frames are broadcast in 
           Abridges when the destination is unknown. The tree instance used by the 
           ingress Abridge to broadcast is its own tree instance rooted at that 
           Abridge. To limit broadcast to the ports belonging to the VLAN, it is 
           necessary to filter by VLAN, which means that separate tree instances 
           must be built for VLAN forwarding, increasing the complexity or at least 
           requiring additional filtering on the tree instance used for broadcast,  
           performed using the VLAN tag inside the encapsulated frame.  
            
           The recommendation, as default behaviour, is that VLAN tagged frames are 
           encapsulated in the same way as non VLAN tagged frames and no VLAN 
           specific forwarding is performed in the Abridges.  
               
            
         6.5 Optimizing ARP/ND  
            Mechanisms proposed for Rbridges for ARP/ND optimization [10] are 
           feasible in Abridges as well. However, if proposed ARP/Abridge servers 
           are used for ARP and destination Abridge resolution they become 
           redundant. 
           
         7. Security Considerations [To be added]

            INTERNET DRAFT                  Rbridge     November 16, 2005 
             
             
            As for Rbridges, the objective of Abridges is to keep at least the same  
            security level of bridged networks, not introducing additional risks.  
             
            However the position of Abridges and their role as Root Bridges combined 
            with the use of ARP Servers/Registrars allow efficient means to enhance 
            the network security due to easier localization of attackers, fast 
            detection of spoofed MACs by successive and duplicated, inconsistent 
            registries, etc. 
          
            If IEEE 802.1X is used in link ports connecting Abridges, security is 
            greatly enhanced in the network core, although it can not prevent 
            malicious behaviour of trusted authenticated Abridges.  
             
            However, authentication requires some additional configuration, which 
            contradicts in part the zero configuration objective of Rbridges and 
            Abridges.  
           
         8. NRSTP Protocol 
           This concept is in its early stages, and requires detailed analysis and 
           is described summarily here due to its simplicity.   
           An alternative to implementing multiple simplified spanning trees like 
           AMSTP might consist of a simultaneous and independent construction of N 
           spanning trees (one per Abridge) by full independent execution of N RSTP 
           protocols (single code, multiple data) at each Abridge. Each Abridge 
           executes  RSTP protocol N times simultaneously to participate in N tree 
           instances. In one of the N protocol executions, the Abridge claims itself 
           as the nonnegotiable root bridge. At the same time, with the other N-1 
           RSTP protocol executions, the Abridge joins the N-1 RST tree instances 
           proposed by the other N-1 Abridges of the core. As for AMSTP, the 
           destination Abridge tree instance is used to forward unicast frames, 
           while for broadcast and multicast, the  originating Abridge tree instance 
           is used. The number of BPDUs is multiplied, but processing and 
           implementation may be simplified.    
          
         9. Conclusions  
          
           An alternative implementation for Rbridges has been described. It 
           provides pair-wise shortest paths using multiple L2 spanning trees across 
           Abridges instead of link state L2 routing. The proposal has lower 
           computational complexity than Rbridges and is scalable to large scale 
           Ethernet campus networks. A topological restriction, automatically 
           controlled, is introduced: core forwarding only operates on dedicated 
           links that interconnect Abridges. Obtainable convergence is likely 
           similar to that obtained by the standard IEEE Rapid Spanning Tree 
           protocol, less than 2 seconds, typically in the hundreds of milliseconds 
           range. The design is compatible with current IP nodes and routers and 
           with standard bridges, but any connected standard bridge connected to an 
           Abridge always works outside the network core, in the access layer.

           This draft used the current Rbridges draft as a basis for the structure,         
           and for some of the text, to aid comprehension and to aid comparison 
           between the two.
