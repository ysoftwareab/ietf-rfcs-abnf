Abstract

   This memo extends RFC 2385 to support time-based key rollover and
   multiple hashing algorithms.  Operators can use the time-based key
   rollover feature to in order to periodically update the key that is
   used to create authentication data for each TCP segment.  Operators
   may also wish to select the hashing algorithm used to create
   authentication data depending upon the perceived threat level and the
   computational capabilities of their hardware platforms.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

2.  Introduction

   RFC 2385 [2] proposes a mechanism that secures BGP [3] sessions using
   MD5 [4] authentication.  Specifically, RFC 2385 proposes a TCP MD5
   Signature Option that can be appended to each TCP header.  The MD5
   Signature Option contains a 16-byte MD5 digest that serves as
   authentication data for the TCP segment.  The MD5 digest is
   calculated over the following fields:

      - the TCP pseudo-header

      - the TCP header, excluding options, and assuming a checksum of
      zero

      - the TCP segment data (if any)

      - an independently-specified key or password, known to both TCPs
      and presumably connection-specific

   To spoof a connection using the scheme described above, an attacker
   would not only have to guess TCP sequence numbers, but would also
   have had to obtain the password included in the MD5 digest.  This
   password never appears in the connection stream, and the actual form
   of the password is determined by the application.

   RFC 3562 [5] addresses key management considerations regarding the
   TCP MD5 Signature Option.  Specifically, based upon the strength of
   the MD5 hashing algorithm, RFC 3562 recommends that keys SHOULD be
   changed at least every 90 days.

   Unfortunately, the strategy described in RFC 2385 permits keys to be
   changed during the lifetime of a TCP connection only so long as the
   change is synchronized at both ends.  This limitation has proven to
   be a significant deterrent to the deployment of the TCP MD5 Signature
   Option for BGP.

   This document addresses the above mentioned limitation.  It also
   extends the strategy proposed in RFC 2385 to allow for other hashing
   algorithms besides MD5.

3.  Proposal

   This document proposes a new TCP Enhanced Authentication Option that
   is used as follows.

   Operators configure a list of authentication elements for each
   protected TCP connection.  Each authentication element includes the
   following data items:

      - an authentication element identifier (integer [0..255])

      - a key

      - a hash algorithm

      - a start time

   Each authentication element in the list must include a unique element
   identifier and a unique start time.

   Whenever TCP generates a segment, it selects an authentication
   element from the list.  The selected element must have a start time
   that is less than or equal to the current time.  If multiple
   authentication elements meet that criteria, TCP will select one of
   them.  Specifically, it will select the authentication element that
   specifies the latest start time.

   TCP then inserts the new option and calculates a message digest.  It
   calculates a message digest by applying the hash algorithm from the
   selected authentication element to the following items in the order
   that they are listed:

      - the TCP pseudo-header

      - the TCP header, including options, but with hash value set to
      zero for the purpose of computation and assuming a checksum of
      zero

      - the TCP segment data (if any)

      - the key specified by the selected authentication element

   For IPv4, the pseudo-header is described in RFC 793 [6].  It includes
   the 32-bit source IP address, the 32-bit destination IP address, the
   zero-extended protocol number (to form 16 bits), and the 16-bit
   segment length.  Note that this includes use of IPv4 via IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 addresses, in which case the source and destination IP addresses
   are from the IPv4 portions of the IPv6 source and destination



Bonica & Heffernan        Expires April 8, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             TCP Authentication               October 2005


   addresses, respectively.

   For IPv6, the pseudo-header is described in RFC 2460 [7].  It
   includes the 128-bit source IPv6 address, the 128-bit destination
   IPv6 address, the zero-extended next header value (to form 32 bits),
   and the 32-bit segment length.

   For any other network protocol, the pseudo-header is as described in
   the document that defines how upper-level protocols like TCP compute
   their checksums.

   The header and pseudo-header are in network byte order.  The nature
   of the key is deliberately left unspecified, but it must be known by
   both ends of the connection.  A particular TCP implementation will
   determine what the application may specify as the key.

   Having calculated the message digest, TCP updates the new TCP option
   to include the message digest.  TCP then calculates a checksum and
   forwards the segment to its TCP peer.

   The TCP peer is also configured with a list of authentication
   elements for the connection.  Having received a TCP segment, the TCP
   peer scans its list of authentication elements, searching for an
   element whose identifier matches that which was specified by the
   incoming TCP option.  If such an authentication element is found, TCP
   uses the key from that authentication element to calculate a message
   digest.  If the calculated message digest matches the message digest
   received in the incoming TCP segment, the segment is accepted.
   Otherwise, TCP declares an authentication failure and discards the
   datagram.  An authentication failure MUST NOT produce any response
   back to the sender.  Routers SHOULD log authentication failures.

   Unlike other TCP extensions (e.g., the Window Scale option [8]), the
   absence of the option in the SYN,ACK segment must not cause the
   sender to disable its sending of authentication data.  This
   negotiation is typically done to prevent some TCP implementations
   from misbehaving upon receiving options in non-SYN segments.  This is
   not a problem for this option, since the SYN,ACK sent during
   connection negotiation will not be signed and will thus be ignored.
   The connection will never be made, and non-SYN segments with options
   will never be sent.  More importantly, the sending of authentication
   data must be under the complete control of the application, not at
   the mercy of the remote host not understanding the option.

   Figure 1: Option Syntax

   Kind: 8 bits

   The Kind field identifies the TCP Enhanced Authentication Option.
   This value will be assigned by IANA.

   Length: 8 bits

   The Length field specifies the length of the TCP Enhanced
   Authentication Option, in octets.  This count includes two octets
   representing the Kind and Length fields.

   Auth ID: 8 bits

   The Auth ID field identifies the authentication element that was used
   to generate the message digest.

   Reserved: 8 bits

   Must be equal to zero.

   Message Digest: Variable length

   A Message Digest that serves as authentication data for the TCP
   segment.  The length of the Message Digest, and therefore, the length
   of the entire option, is determined by the hash algorithm.

   Table 1 maps hash algorithms to the size of the digests that they
   produce.  Permissible hash algorithms are not restricted to those
   listed in the table.

5.  Implications

5.1.  Clock Synchronization

   Because the TCP Enhanced Authentication Option includes an
   authentication element identifier, the strategy described herein is
   immune from most problems caused by poor clock synchronization.
   Clocks do not need to be synchronized between the sending and
   receiving systems.  The only requirement is that the authentication
   element used to generate the the hash value on the sending system is
   also configured on the receiving system.

   Receipt of a segment whose authentication data was generated using a
   stale authentication element does not constitute an error.  It may
   indicate only that clocks are not synchronized between the sending
   and receiving systems.

5.2.  Connectionless Resets

   A connectionless reset will be ignored by the receiver of the reset,
   since the originator of that reset does not know the key and
   therefore cannot generate the proper authentication data for the
   segment.  This means, for example, that connection attempts by a TCP
   which is generating authentication data to a port with no listener
   will time out instead of being refused.  Similarly, resets generated
   by a TCP in response to segments sent on a stale connection will also
   be ignored.  Operationally this can be a problem since resets help
   some protocols recover quickly from peer crashes.

5.3.  Performance

   The performance hit in calculating digests may inhibit the use of
   this option.  Performance will vary depending upon processor type,

Internet-Draft             TCP Authentication               October 2005


   hash algorithm, packet size and number of hash calculations per
   second.

5.4.  TCP Header Size

   As with other options that are added to every segment, the size of
   the TCP Enhanced Authentication Option must be factored into the MSS
   offered to the other side during connection negotiation.
   Specifically, the size of the header to subtract from the MTU
   (whether it is the MTU of the outgoing interface or IP's minimal MTU
   of 576 octets) is now increased by the size of the TCP Enhanced
   Authentication Option.

   The total header size is also an issue.  The TCP header specifies
   where segment data starts with a 4-bit field which gives the total
   size of the header (including options) in 32-byte words.  This means
   that the total size of the header plus option must be less than or
   equal to 60 octets.  This leaves 40 octets for options.

   As a concrete example, assume that a TCP implementation defaults to
   sending window-scaling for connections it initiates.  The most loaded
   segment will be the initial SYN packet to start the connection.  With
   a TCP Enhanced Authentication object using SHA1 authentication, the
   SYN packet will contain the following:

      -- 4 octets MSS option

      -- 4 octets window scale option (3 octets padded to 4 in this
      implementation)

      -- 24 octets for the TCP Enhanced Authentication Option

      -- 2 octets for end-of-option-list, to pad to a 32-bit boundary.

   This sums to exactly 34 octets.  This leaves only 6 octets for
   additional TCP options.  Some longer options (e.g.  Timestamp) would
   not fit in that space.

5.5.  Key Configuration

   It should be noted that the key configuration mechanism of routers
   may restrict the possible keys that may be used between peers.  It is
   strongly recommended that an implementation be able to support at
   minimum a key composed of a string of printable ASCII of 80 octets or
   less, as this is current practice.

   During the lifetime of a TCP connection, network operators may add or
   delete any key.  However, the network operator must ensure that the

Internet-Draft             TCP Authentication               October 2005


   active key is always configured on both TCP enpoints.

   Network operators may choose to protect multiple connections with a
   single list of authentication elements.  For example, a network
   operator may associate every TCP connection supporting iBGP with one
   authentication element list while associating a unique authentication
   element list with each TCP connection that supports eBGP.

   In the future, a key exchange protocol may be specified to provision
   the authentication elements described herein.

5.6.  Backwards Compatibility

   On any particular TCP connection, use of the TCP Enhanced
   Authentication Option precludes use of the TCP MD5 Signature Option.
   However, use of the TCP Enhanced Authentication Option on one
   connection does not preclude the use of the TCP MD5 Signature Option
   on another connection by the same system.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a weak but easily deployed security mechanism
   for TCP-based routing protocols.  It is anticipated that future work
   will provide different stronger mechanisms for dealing with these
   issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will assign a codepoint for the TCP Enhanced Authentication
   Option.
