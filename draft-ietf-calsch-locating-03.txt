Abstract

When scheduling a calendar entity, such as an event, it is a
prerequisite that an organizer has the calendar address of each attendee
that will be invited to the event. Additionally, access to an attendee's
current "busy time" provides an a priori indication of whether the
attendee will be free to participate in the event.

In order to meet these challenges, a calendar user agent (CUA) needs a
mechanism to locate (URI) individual user's calendar and free/busy time.

This memo defines three mechanisms for obtaining a URI to a user's
calendar and free/busy time. These include:

- Manual transfer of the information;

- Personal data exchange using the vCard format; and

1  Calendaring and Scheduling URIs

This memo defines four classes of URIs. URIs are more useful if it is
understood what the URIs point to. Here is a brief description:

1.1 Free/Busy URI (FBURL)

The free/busy URI is defined to be a transport independent location
where a client can obtain information about when a user is busy. At the
present time, this URI only points to busy time data. Future revisions
of this specification may provide for the extended capability of
publishing free time data.

If a calendaring and scheduling client (i.e., CUA) were to retrieve data
from this location using FTP or HTTP, it would get back an iCalendar
object [4] containing one or more "VFREEBUSY" calendar components. If a
MIME transport is being used, the response will be contained within a
"text/calendar" MIME body part as specified in the iCalendar
specification [4]. For example:


   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
   VERSION:2.0
   PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
   METHOD:PUBLISH
   BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
   ATTENDEE:MAILTO:jane_doe@host1.com
   DTSTART:19971013T050000Z
   DTEND:19971124T050000Z
   DTSTAMP:19970901T083000Z
   FREEBUSY:19971015T133000Z/19971015T180000Z
   FREEBUSY:19971015T190000Z/19971015T220000Z
   FBURL:http://www.host.com/calendar/busy/jdoe.ifb
   END:VFREEBUSY
   END:VCALENDAR

The amount of busy time data pointed to by the FBURL will generally be
pre-determined; for example one month of busy time data. As a guideline,
it is recommended that the previous six weeks of busy time data be
published at the location associated with the FBURL. If this URI points
to a file resource, it is recommended that the file extension be "ifb"
to distinguish it from an arbitrary iCalendar object (e.g., with the
"ics" file extension).

INTERNET-DRAFT         Locating A Calendar User           June 21, 1999


1.2 Calendar Address URI (CALADRURI)

The calendar address URI is defined to be a transport independent
communication end-point for a user. The organizer's calendaring and
scheduling client (ie. CUA) would use this URI to determine where to
send an event request when organizing a meeting with a particular
attendee.

If the user prefers to receive event requests via iMIP, then the user
would provide a "mailto" URI containing the user's e-mail address. [5]
For example:


   mailto:user@host1.com

The URI for an iRIP user is yet to be defined, but that is another
possible URI value in this property.

1.3 Calendar Access URI (CAPURI)

The Calendar Access URI is defined to be a protocol independent location
from which a calendaring and scheduling client (i.e., CUA) can
communicate with a user's entire calendar.

The semantics for using this URI as an access protocol locator are yet
to be defined by the IETF CALSCH Working Group. This will be addressed
in the "Calendar Access Protocol" specification.

1.4 Calendar URI (CALURI)

The Calendar URI is defined to be a protocol independent location from
which a calendaring and scheduling client (i.e. CUA) can retrieve an
entire copy of a user's calendar. Retrieving data from this URI obtains
a published "snapshot" of the user's calendar.

HTTP URI -- If the URI is an HTTP URI, then the content returned with a
GET should be a "text/calendar" MIME body part containing one or more
iCalendar object.

FTP URI -- If the URI is an FTP URI, then the resource pointed to should
be a file with an "ics" file extension containing one or more iCalendar
objects.

1.5 Default URIs

There are many cases where a user may have more than one calendar. In
these cases, a user may have multiple URIs, each URI pointing to a
calendar or free/busy data.

To make the case of multiple calendars simpler for clients, the concept
of the "default" calendar is introduced. A "default" calendar is one
that the user has designated as the calendar that other users should
look at when accessing the user's calendar, or retrieving the user's
free/busy time.

The default calendar may, in fact, include rolled-up information from
all the user's other calendars. The other calendars may only exist for
organizational purposes.

2  Distribution

These four URIs provide valuable pointers to calendaring and scheduling
data that other users need in order to know when to schedule meetings,
etc. There are several possibilities on how users can communicate these
URIs to other users. The following section outlines how these URIs can
be distributed to other users.

2.1 Manual Transfer

The simplest way to obtain these URIs is for a user to communicate the
URIs using some out-of-band mechanism such as verbally, or in an e-mail
message, or by printing these URIs on a paper business card.

When using this mechanism, the user obtains these URIs using an out-of-
band mechanism and then enters these URIs into their calendaring
software manually.

2.2 Personal Data Exchange Using A vCard

A more sophisticated way to obtain these URIs is for users to publish
vCards containing these URIs. The vCard object can be transferred
between one another. Since many e-mail clients allow a user to
automatically include a vCard with every message that the user sends,
this provides a simple, transparent way for a user to distribute their
calendaring and scheduling URIs.

On the receiving end, an e-mail client that provides an integrated vCard
database can provide a way to lookup calendaring URIs for users whose
vCards are stored locally.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Locating A Calendar User           June 21, 1999


2.3 vCard Schema Extensions

Since the vCard [3] specification doesn't specify how to encode
calendaring URIs in a vCard, this section is provided as an extension to
vCard which specifies how to encode calendaring URIs within a vCard.

Inside a vCard object, four new properties are defined: "CALURI",
"CAPURI", "CALADRURI", and "FBURL", as defined above.

Any vCard can have one or more of these properties, each representing a
calendar or free/busy time that is associated with the user.

One of these properties can be designated as the "default" by adding the
"PREF" parameter.

Here is a simple example of a vCard containing a "FBURL" and a "CALURI".

   CALURI:ftp://ftp.host1.com/calA.ics

2.4 Directory Lookup Using The LDAP v3 Protocol

Another way to obtain these URIs is to look them up in a directory using
the LDAP protocol [1].

If a user's URIs can be found using directory lookup (i.e., searching
for one of the LDAP schema extensions defined below), they should, in
general, be considered "more up-to-date" than URIs in any vCards that
are stored locally.

2.4.1     LDAP Schema Extensions

In order to encode the calendaring URIs in the directory, the following
are defined:

- One object class:

   - calEntry

- Eight attributes:

   - calCalURI

   - calFBURL

   - calCAPURI

   - calCalAdrURI

   - calOtherCalURIs

   - calOtherFBURLs

   - calOtherCAPURIs

   - calOtherCalAdrURIs

The calCalURI contains the URI to a snapshot of the user's entire
default calendar. The calFBURL contains the URI to the user's default
busy time data. The calCAPURI represents contains a URI that can be used


Small, Hennessy, Dawson     -- Page 11 --         Expires December 1999




INTERNET-DRAFT         Locating A Calendar User           June 21, 1999


to communicate with the user's calendar. The calCalAdrURI contains a URI
that points to the location to which event requests should be sent for
that user.

The calOtherCalURIs is a multi-valued property containing URIs to
snapshots of other calendars that the user may have. The calOtherFBURLs
is a multi-valued property containing URIs to other free/busy data that
the user may have. The calOtherCAPURIs attribute is a multi-valued
property containing URIs to other calendars that the user may have. The
calOtherCalAdrURIs attribute is a multi-valued property containing URIs
to other locations that a user may want event requests sent to.

There is no predetermined order to the values in either multi-valued
property.

2.4.2     Notation

The notation used in this memo is the same as that used in [2].

2.4.3     Object Definitions

2.4.3.1   calEntry

The Calendar Entry is a class derived from "TOP" [2], which contains the
four calendaring attributes.

3  IANA Considerations

This memo defines IANA registered extensions to the attributes defined
by LDAP [1] and vCard [3].

IANA registration proposals for vCard are to be emailed to the
registration agent for the "text/directory" MIME content-type, <MAILTO:
ietf-mime-directory@imc.org> using the format defined in [3].

INTERNET-DRAFT         Locating A Calendar User           June 21, 1999


4  Security Considerations

Standard vCard and LDAP security rules and support apply for the
extensions described in this document, and there are no special security
issues for these extensions.

Please note, though, that LDAP servers may permit anonymous clients to
refresh entries which they did not create. Servers are also permitted to
control a refresh access to an entry by requiring clients to bind before
issuing a RefreshRequest. This will have implications on the server
performance and scalability.

Please also note, though, that vCard objects may have been created by an
entity other than that represented by the vCard. Recipients should be
certain of the source that generated the vCard.

Also, care should be taken in making use of information obtained from
directory servers that has been supplied by client, as it may now be out
of date. In many networks, for example, IP addresses are automatically
assigned when a host connects to the network, and may be reassigned if
that host later disconnects. An IP address obtained from the directory
may no longer be assigned to the host that placed the address in the
directory. This issue is not specific to LDAP or dynamic directories.
