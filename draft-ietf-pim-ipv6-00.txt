Abstract

   This document outlines recommendations in the use of Protocol
   Independent Multicast routing protocol to support Internet Protocol
   Version 6.  It describes the changes needed in order to handle the
   differences between IPv6 and IPv4 and conform to the logic introduced
   by other routing protocols enabled for IPv6.

1. Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].


2. Introduction

   This document describes a protocol for efficiently routing to
   multicast groups communicating with the Internet Protocol Version 6
   (IPv6).  This document will only describe recommendations for making 
   PIM conform to practices implemented by other IPv6 routing protocols.
   The existing PIM drafts should be referenced for actual protocol 
   operation.


3. Definitions and Assumptions

    -  Link Local Address - A local-use, non-routable unicast IPv6
       address [RFC 2373].

    -  All-PIM-Routers multicast address -
       A permanently assigned link-scoped IPv6 multicast address for the
       PIM protocol [RFC 2375].

   It is assumed that a router running PIM for IPv6 will have a network
   unique, globally routable IPv6 address that will serve as the 
   router's Router-ID.


4. Protocol Impact

   The following will outline suggested values for the PIM protocol 
   messages in order to support IPv6.  For most messages, the changes 
   involve the addresses used in the IPv6 header.


4.1. Hello Message

   When sending a Hello Message, a PIM router must use a different set 
   of IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header.  The IPv6 destination address 
   must be the All-PIM-Routers multicast address.  The IPv6 source 
   address must be the IPv6 link local address of the interface on which 
   this message is being forwarded.  The link local address in the 
   source address field will be used to determine

   neighbor adjacency and for DR election.  It should be noted, that the
   DR will identify itself using its Router-ID.


4.2. Register Message

   The Register Message is addressed to the Router-ID of the RP. The
   source address of the message is the Router-ID of the DR. The DR
   sending the Register Message obtains the Router-ID of the RP from the
   local RP-set information.


4.3. Register-Stop Message

   The Register-Stop Message is addressed in the same manner as the
   Register Message.  The RP addresses the message to the Router-ID of
   the DR. The source address is the Router-ID of the RP. The RP obtains
   the Router-ID of the DR from the source address field of the Register
   Message received from the DR.


4.4. Join/Prune, Graft, and Graft-Ack Messages

   In the transmission of a Join/Prune Message, a router sets the IPv6 
   destination address to the All-PIM-Routers multicast address.  The 
   IPv6 source address is set to the link local address of the interface 
   on which the message is forwarded.  The Upstream Neighbor Address 
   field is set to the link local address of the next hop router, which 
   is obtained from the RPF lookup.


4.5. Bootstrap Message

   When sending a Bootstrap Message, a PIM router sets the IPv6
   destination address to the All-PIM-Routers multicast address.  The
   source address is the link local address of the interface on which
   the message is forwarded.  The BSR Address is set to the Router-ID of
   the BSR.


4.6. Assert Message

   The Assert Message has an IPv6 destination address of the
   All-PIM-Routers multicast address and an IPv6 source address of the
   link local address of the interface forwarding the message.  The link
   local address in the IPv6 source field is used to resolve ties in the

   assert process.  Downstream routers save the winning assert router's
   link local address to resolve any future RPF requirements.


4.7. Candidate-RP-Advertisement Message

   The Candidate-RP-Advertisement Message uses the Router-ID of the BSR
   as the IPv6 destination address.  The source address is the Router-ID
   of the candidate RP. The RP Address field is set to the Router-ID of 
   the candidate RP. Each candidate RP router creates this message and 
   unicasts it to the BSR.


5. IPv6 Address Scoping

   With the introduction of scoped addresses in IPv6, new issues arise
   in the distribution of scoped routes and the forwarding of scoped 
   packets.  Currently, work in the area of scoping has been limited.  
   An Internet draft does exist that outlines the changes needed to 
   routing protocols in order to support the IPv6 scoped addresses 
   [SCOPE]. Currently, this work only addresses PIM running within a 
   single site or organization.


6. Additional Areas of Work

   The main area of additional work is in the support of site- and
   organization-scoped IPv6 multicast addresses.  If a PIM domain is 
   to cross an IPv6 scope domain, then guidelines for supporting the 
   following will have to be developed :

    -  Scoped RP addresses

    -  Scoped DR addresses

    -  Scoped BSR addresses
