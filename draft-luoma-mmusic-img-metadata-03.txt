Abstract

   This document defines the base metadata format for Internet Media
   Guides (IMGs), applicable to a wide variety of Internet hosts and
   communication links. IMG metadata describes files, resources and
   multimedia programs available for streaming or downloading via
   multicast or unicast. An IMG metadata model and semantics of the IMG
   media metadata entities are defined. The aim is to reuse existing
   metadata standards for the IMG metadata format where possible.

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


1. Introduction

   This document defines the Internet Media Guide (IMG) metadata model
   and the IMG media metadata elements. This is intended as a baseline
   specification of the IMG metadata format that can be supplemented by
   other specifications, e.g. for application-specific extensions. The
   scope and background of the work on Internet Media Guides have been
   described in the IMG requirements [2] and IMG framework [3]
   specifications.

   The purpose of the IMG metadata is to provide machine- and
   human-readable information describing the files, resources and
   multimedia programs available for streaming or downloading via
   multicast or unicast. The IMG metadata format will be used in the IMG
   framework [3] as a payload format for IMG transport protocols, such
   as MUPPET [8]. The IMG media metadata (or references to it) is
   encapsulated into, or associated with, an IMG transfer envelope [9]
   before actual transport. The aim is to reuse existing metadata
   standards for the IMG metadata format where possible.

3. Terminology

      Internet Media Guide (IMG)

         An IMG is a generic term to describe the formation, delivery
         and use of IMG metadata. The definition of the IMG is
         intentionally left imprecise.

      IMG Element

         The smallest atomic element of IMG metadata that can be
         transmitted separately and referenced individually from other
         IMG elements.

      IMG Media Metadata

         Includes the relational part, session part and content part of
         IMG metadata. Does not include the metadata relating to IMG
         transport, e.g. the fields of the IMG transfer envelope [9].

      IMG Metadata

         A set of metadata consisting of one or more IMG elements. IMG
         metadata describes the features of multimedia content used to
         enable selection of and access to media sessions containing
         content. For example, metadata may consist of the URI, title,
         airtime, bandwidth needed, file size, text summary, genre and
         access restrictions.

      IMG Metadata Model

         Defines the information content, semantics and relations of the
         different IMG metadata entities.

      IMG Receiver

         A logical entity that receives media guides from an IMG sender,
         analogous to a client.

      IMG Sender

         A logical entity that delivers IMG metadata to one or more IMG
         receivers, analogous to a server. A sender shall provide
         bandwidth control or congestion control schemes on the output.
         A sender can additionally be a receiver - see IMG transceiver.

      IMG Transceiver

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


         A combination of an IMG receiver and sender.

      IMG Transport Protocol

         A protocol that transports IMG metadata from IMG sender to IMG
         receiver(s).

4. IMG Metadata Model

   The media metadata in an Internet Media Guide is structured in three
   parts: a relatively static part known as the 'relational part' and
   the more dynamic parts known as the 'session part' and 'content
   part'. This chapter describes the metadata entities and their
   relations in the three parts of IMG metadata.

   This chapter describes a baseline metadata model for Internet Media
   Guides that includes metadata entities common for most IMG usage
   scenarios. It should be possible to extend the IMG metadata format,
   e.g. with application-specific parts, but such extensions are outside
   the scope of this document.

   Note, some metadata fields are marked 'optional' to indicate that it
   is optional whether to use these fields in the respective metadata.
   However, IMG receivers MUST be capable of parsing both 'mandatory'
   and 'optional' fields.

4.1 The Relational Part of IMG Metadata

   The relation part of the IMG metadata is used to relate the various
   parts of the metadata. This includes IP service portals based on the
   type of content, and to organize IP services into IP service portals.
   The metadata in the relational part is intended to be browsed by
   end-users and by end-user applications, allowing them to decide on
   what content to receive. For example, an IMG could be rendered as a
   simple hierarchy as shown in Figure 1.

   The relations between the metadata elements that constitute an IMG
   hierarchy are shown in Figure 2. Note that the cardinalities between
   metadata elements in this and the other entity relationship diagrams
   are denoted as follows:

   o  0..1: Zero or one occurrences.

   o  1: Exactly one occurrence.

   o  *: Zero or more occurrences.

   o  1..*: One or more occurrences.

             Figure 2: Relational part of the IMG metadata

   The metadata elements of the relational part are described in the
   following subsections. Note that IP session belongs to the session
   part rather than the relational part of IMG metadata, and is only
   shown in Figure 2 to show the connection between the two parts - see
   Section 4.2.1 for definition of IP session.

4.1.1 IMG Root

   The IMG root is a logical entity that represents one IMG database. It
   is expected that both single logical receivers and single logical
   senders will maintain their own single IMG root (thus an IMG single
   database). Thus an IMG root is unique to a unique logical host.




Luoma, et al.            Expires June 18, 2004                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


   It may be desirable or a host to separate IMG roots from different
   senders (or senders in separately administered domains). Thus, a
   practical refinement is that one receiver may maintain more than one
   IMG root (in one or more actual databases). In this case the receiver
   is behaving as multiple logical receivers, possibly sharing actual
   processes, databases and user interfaces.

   The document does not impose any requirements on the relationships
   between the deployment of physical devices and of: logical senders;
   logical transceivers; and, logical receivers.

   IMG root is a container for the other IMG elements. The only
   information field in the IMG root itself is the identifier of the
   Internet Media Guide represented by the IMG root:

   o  IMG ID: The unique identifier of the IMG.


4.1.2 Category

   The category provides a classification for content, allowing
   end-users to browse available content according to category or client
   software to automatically filter content. Each category node MAY be
   associated with categories of the next lower hierarchy level. Except
   for root-level categories, one higher-level category node MUST be
   associated with every category node. The following information fields
   are included for a category:

   o  Category ID: The unique identifier of the category.

   o  Name: The name of the category.

   o  Description (optional): Short description for the category.

   o  Parental rating (optional): Minimum recommended age to access the
      category - if absent it is assumed there are no restrictions.

   o  Additional information (optional): A URL for retrieving additional
      information.


4.1.3 IP Service Portal

   An IP service portal is a collection of services offered by a single
   service provider or a content provider. An IP service portal MUST be
   associated with one content category node. The path of content
   category nodes from the root of service hierarchy tree to the IP
   service portal (e.g., 'entertainment.music.videos') defines the

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


   category of the portal.

   IP Service Portal inherits the field of category and also uses:

   o  Contact details (optional): A URL to human-readable contact info.

   o  Logo (optional): A URL to a graphical logo of the service/content
      provider.


4.1.4 IP Service Unit

   Any number of IP service units can be included in an IP service
   portal. IP service unit is used here as an abstract entity that is
   realized either as an IP service or an IP service bundle. A separate
   access info element may be associated either with an IP service or an
   IP service bundle.

4.1.5 IP Service

   An IP service consists of a number of IP sessions and belongs to one
   or more content categories. The following information fields are
   included:

   o  Service ID: The unique identifier of IP service.

   o  Name: The name of the IP service.

   o  Description (optional): Short description of the IP service.

   o  Genre (optional): The genre of the IP service.

   o  Parental rating: Minimum recommended age to access the IP service
      (optional - if absent it is assumed there are no restrictions).

   o  Client content path (optional): Recommended path in the receiver's
      file system for storing the content of this service. This would be
      a relative path, which also requires a (receiving)
      application-specific base path to identify the complete local
      path.

   o  Response URL (optional): A URL that can be used by clients to
      provide feedback, e.g. a five-star rating for the service.

   o  Additional information (optional): A URL for retrieving additional
      information.

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


4.1.6 IP Service Bundle

   An IP service bundle is a set consisting of IP services or other IP
   service bundles. For example, an IP service offering a number of
   sessions carrying sports-related content might be bundled together
   with an IP service carrying sessions that distribute movie content.
   The following information fields are included:

   o  Bundle ID: The unique identifier of the IP service bundle.

   o  Name: The name of the IP service bundle.


4.1.7 Access Info

   An access info describes the requirements or preconditions that must
   be met in order to access a particular IP service unit or content.
   For example, details of pricing/billing and age limits could be part
   of the access info.

4.2 The Session Part of IMG Metadata

   The session part of IMG metadata is used to describe the scheduling,
   transport and any audio/video codec parameters of media streams, as
   well as the binding of these media streams into IP sessions (see
   Figure 3). Using this part of IMG metadata, client-side applications
   are able to receive and present media streams belonging to IP
   sessions.

4.2.1 IP Session

   An IP session is the collection of related media streams used for
   delivering IP based content to clients. A session is associated with
   one or more IP services, and shares the category assigned to those IP

4.2.2 IP Session Component

   An IP session component refers to a single media stream that is part
   of an IP session, e.g. video, audio or data flow. Each media stream
   is delivered on one more logical transport channels. An IP session
   component is described using the following parameters:

   o  Bandwidth (optional): Bandwidth requirements of the IP session
      component.

   o  Addressing: The Layer 3 and Layer 4 addressing used for delivering
      the IP session component.

   o  Transport: The transport protocol used.

4.2.3 Scheduling Info

   A delivery schedule is always associated with an IP session. Both the
   start and the end time of an IP session are usually bounded. Either a
   single time period, or a repeating schedule may be specified. The
   following information fields are included:

   o  Start (optional): The start time.

   o  End (optional): The end time.

   o  Repeat (optional): Information on the repetition pattern.

   o  Timezone (optional): Information on any timezone adjustments
      taking place.


4.2.4 Transport Channel

   A logical transport channel in an IP network is defined here by the
   Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocols and addressing parameters used. It
   includes the following:

   o  Source IP address: IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   o  Destination/group IP address: IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   o  Source port: Port number.

   o  Destination port: Port number.

   o  Transport protocol: Transport layer protocol(s) used, e.g. RTP/
      UDP.

   o  Additional transport parameters (optional): For example,
      additional Asyncronous Layered Coding (ALC) parameters.


4.3 The Content Part of IMG Metadata

   The content part of IMG metadata identifies and describes items of
   content delivered within IP sessions, and grouping of these content
   items into bundles of related content (see Figure 4). This part of
   the IMG metadata provides more details into the available content,
   helping end-users and client applications to decide on which IP
   sessions to receive.

               Figure 4: Content part of the IMG metadata

   The metadata elements of the content part are described in the
   following subsections. Note that IP session belongs to the session
   part rather than content part of IMG metadata, and is only shown in
   Figure 2 to show the connection between the two parts. See Section
   4.2.1 for definition of IP session.

4.3.1 Content

   Any number of instances of content can be included in an IP session.
   Content is used here as an abstract entity that is realized either as
   a content item or a content bundle.

4.3.2 Content Item

   A content item is an atomic item of content delivered by the IP
   network and consumed by the end-user, such as an MP3 file or a
   real-time audio/video stream. The following information fields are
   included:

   o  Content item ID: The unique identifier of the content item.

   o  Name: The name of the content item.

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


   o  Content location (optional): The URL or filename used for
      accessing the content item.

   o  Genre (optional): The genre of the content item.

   o  Creator (optional): The creator of the content item.

   o  Owner (optional): The owner rights to this content item (note, the
      rights may be dependent on the context, e.g. copyright ownership
      for streaming delivery).

   o  Description (optional): Short description of the content item.

   o  Parental rating (optional): Minimum recommended age to access the
      content item.

   o  Rating URL (optional): A URL that can be used by clients for
      rating the service.


4.3.3 Content Bundle

   A content bundle is a set of content items or other content bundles.
   For example, a set of PC game downloads can be defined as a content
   bundle. Similarly, a news broadcast that consists of the domestic,
   foreign and sports news as separate content items can be defined as a
   content bundle. The following information fields are included:

   o  Bundle ID: The unique identifier of the content bundle.

   o  Name: The name of the content bundle.


4.3.4 Access Info

   As described in Section 4.1.7.

4.3.5 Scheduling Info

   There may be a delivery schedule associated with an individual
   content item. This information content of this entity is as defined
   in Section 4.2.3.

5. IMG Metadata Format

   If necessary an XML schema can be defined for some parts of the IMG
   metadata that cannot be implemented using existing standards.
   Currently, the following standards are being considered for IMG
   metadata:

   o  MPEG-7 [4] (content part of IMG media metadata).

   o  SDP [5] or SDPng [10] (session part of IMG media metadata).

   o  XPath [6] or XPointer [7] (references to IMG metadata elements).

Internet-Draft                IMG Metadata                 December 2003


6. Security Considerations

   IMG receivers should only trust IMG metadata received from a trusted
   source, with data integrity and authentication of the original IMG
   sender provided at IMG metadata level or by IMG transport protocol.
   IMG receivers also should not trust IMG metadata modified by an IMG
   transceiver, unless the IMG transceiver is trusted and the integrity
   and authenticity of the changes can be similarly verified. However,
   to operate in a typical network environment lacking infrastructure
   for key distribution and trust verification, IMG receivers may also
   be configured to accept untrusted IMG metadata.

   There may also be need to provide access control to the content
   described by the IMG or to protect the confidentiality of an
   individual user requesting a particular subset of an IMG. Such
   privacy requirements are met by the use of encryption at IMG metadata
   level or by IMG transport protocol.
