                                Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
managing Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) [1] speakers.

1.  The The Internet-Standard Management Framework

For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC
3410 [7].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed
through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the
MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that is
compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [4], STD
58, RFC 2579 [5] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [6].

2.  Revision History

A record of changes which will be removed before publication.

11 July 2004

     Renamed to draft-ietf-mboned-msdp-mib-00.

     Fixed spec references and defaults for msdpPeerHoldTimeConfigured,
     msdpPeerKeepAliveConfigured and msdpPeerConnectRetryInterval, as
     pointed out by Ketan Talaulikar.

     Deprecated all objects related to SA-Requests and notifications,
     since RFC 3618 doesn't have either one.  As pointed out by Ketan
     Talaulikar.

     Clarified that msdpSACachePeerLearnedFrom should be 0.0.0.0 on the
     originator.  From Mike Davison.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: January 2005                July 2004


     Removed msdpSAStatePeriod.  I couldn't figure out what it's for; at
     best it should be SG State Period, but that's already
     msdpCacheLifetime.  From Mike Davison.

17 October 2003

     Undid most of the hard work since draft -03, which is the only
     implementation I was able to find by querying the MSDP mailing
     list.

29 May 2003

     Republished with no changes.  How did it get to be almost 2 years?

18 July 2001

     Since the INET-ADDRESS-MIB relaxed restrictions on InetAddressType,
     remove msdpPeerLocalAddressType, rename msdpSACacheGroupAddrType to
     msdpCacheAddrType, remove msdpCacheSourceAddrType,
     msdpSACacheOriginRPType, msdpSACachePeerLearnedFromType,
     msdpSACacheRPFPeerType.

     Updated the DESCRIPTION of msdpRequestsTable to describe exactly
     how it is used.

     Added msdpPeerDiscontinuityTime.

     Changed msdpPeerFsmEstablishedTime to a TimeStamp instead of a
     counting number of seconds.

     Changed msdpPeerInMessageElapsedTime to msdpPeerInMessageTime and
     changed it to a TimeStamp.

     Added msdpMeshGroupTable.

     Updated conformance information.

1 March 2001

     Added msdpPeerIfIndex.

     Converted all IpAddress items to InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.
     This bigtime violates RFC2578's rules about MIB evolution, so take
     extra care when implementing this change.

     Added msdpRequestsPriority, in order to allow configuration of
     multiple peers to whom Requests will be sent.  Note that this
     violates RFC2578's rules about MIB evolution, so take extra care

     when implementing this change.

     Removed DEFVAL on scalars, since it should only be needed for table
     row creation.

     Removed msdpPeerSAAdvPeriod, since the spec changed to say its
     value MUST be 60.

     Added none(0) to msdpPeerEncapsulationType enumeration XXX is this
     OK? should it be 4?

     Removed msdpPeerEncapsulationState since the encapsulation
     "negotiation" was removed from the spec.

     Added msdpRPAddress to specify the RP address to use when sourcing
     SA messages.

     Added msdpSACacheSourcePrefix to msdpSACacheTable, and added it to
     the INDEX.  Note that this violates RFC2578's rules about MIB
     evolution, so take extra care when implementing this change.

     Completely renumbered the MIB, removing the extra level of
     msdpMIBobjects and creating an msdpScalars group to contain all
     scalars.  Note that this violates RFC2578's rules about MIB
     evolution, so take extra care when implementing this change.

16 December 1999

     Added msdpSAHoldDownPeriod, msdpPeerEncapsulationState,
     msdpPeerEncapsulationType, msdpPeerConnectionAttempts,
     msdpPeerInNotifications, msdpPeerOutNotifications, and
     msdpLastError

     Removed msdpPeerConfigMethod, since this has disappeared from the
     spec.

     Renamed the states in msdpPeerState to go with the state machine in
     the spec.

     Added msdpPeerLocalPort and msdpPeerRemotePort in order to provide
     full information about the TCP connection in use.  I'd like to
     reorder the Peer Table but that can wait until the MIB gets
     published as an RFC in order to only change things like that once.

     Added msdpSACacheOriginRP as an INDEX to the msdpSACacheTable.
     Note that this violates RFC2578's rules about MIB evolution, so
     take extra care when implementing this change.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: January 2005                July 2004


25 June 1999

     Renamed to DRAFT-MSDP-MIB.  It will be renamed back to MSDP-MIB
     when it gets renumbered under mib-2, in order to avoid module
     naming problems.

     Turned msdpSendRequestsTo into a table in order to handle
     administratively scoped groups with different RP's.

27 May 1999

     Added IANA-assigned experimental OID

     Added msdpSendRequestsTo and msdpPeerProcessRequestsFrom to
     configure MSDP SA-Request/Response processing.

     Added msdpPeerDataTtl to allow TTL scoping of data packets
     forwarded across MSDP peerings.

     Renumbered msdpSACacheInDataPackets and further items in
     msdpSACacheTable, to eliminate duplicate OIDs

20 April 1999

     initial version.


3.  Overview

XXX This needs to be updated.

This MIB module contains three scalars and three tables.  The tables
are:

o    the Requests Table, containing the longest-match table used to
     determine the peer to send SA-Requests to for a given group;

o    the Peer Table, containing information on the peers; and

o    the Source-Active Cache Table, containing the SA cache entries.

            required.  If SA Requests are not enabled, this table may be
            empty.

            In order to choose a peer to whom to send an SA Request for
            a given group G, the subset of entries in this table whose

            set is further reduced by examining only those entries for
            which msdpPeerRequestsGroupAddressType equals the address
            type of G, and the entries with the highest value of
            msdpRequestsGroupPrefix are considered, where the group G

5.  Open Issues

The Backwards Transition notification won't trigger on established ->
disabled.  Is that desired?

Is the RowStatus object in the SACache appropriate?  (e.g. used to flush
potentially bad state)

Are there any other variables appropriate for configuring/managing mesh
groups?

Is the msdpRPAddress useful?  Per-peer?  Remove it completely?

Should we use IpAddress (since RFC 3618 is v4-only) or
InetAddressType/InetAddress?

6.  Security Considerations


There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be
considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
sensitive information. These are:

It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 3414 [2] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 3415 [3] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
