Abstract

   Two problems with BCP78 are identified, and a proposal to solve them
   is proposed.  The first problem is that rights to Contributions (to
   copy, distribute, etc) are not granted to third parties.  The second
   problem is that the rights that were supposedly intended to be
   granted to third parties are too limited for some uses of
   Contributions.  The uses include incorporating portions of
   Contributions into online help, reference manuals, source code
   comments or even into source code itself.

Internet-Draft               RFC 3978 Update                October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document discuss two problems with BCP78.  Familiarity with that
   document is assumed.  In particular, several terms defined in that
   document are used below.  After describing the problems, we conclude
   by proposing a solution.

   The reader should be aware that another BCP78 Update proposal has
   been published [6].  From what we can tell, that document do not
   address the problems discussed in this document.  That document do
   modify some other unrelated matters, which we have no objections to.
   It is thus expected that these two documents may eventually be
   merged, depending on the discussion and outcome of working group
   discussions.


2.  Problem #1: No Rights Are Granted To Third Parties

   Traditionally, third parties have been permitted to copy and
   distribute Contributions.  BCP78 [1] do not include any license
   statement to permit this.

   The rights granted to Contributions, in section 3.3 of BCP78, begin
   with (emphasis mine):


     a. To the extent that a Contribution or any portion thereof is
         protected by copyright and other rights of authorship, the
         Contributor, and each named co-Contributor, and the
         organization he or she represents or is sponsored by (if
         any) grant a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-
         free, world-wide right and license to the ISOC and the IETF
                                            ------------------------
         under all intellectual property rights in the Contribution:

   That means the all the rights given in that section are given to the
   IETF and the ISOC, but not to third parties.  Similar wording occur
   in section 4.2 on rights granted for RFC Editor contributions.

   Scott Bradner claims [7] that section 7.1 give you these rights.
   However, the entire section 7 is titled:

      Exposition of why these procedures are the way they are

   We believe section 7.1 can thus not be reasonable said to be included
   in the actual license statement.  Rather, it is only part of the
   considerations that went into the process that ended up with the
   current license statement.

   Another argument that were put forward was that the note
   "distribution of this memo is unlimited" in RFCs give third parties
   the necessary rights.  However, there is no requirement for that text
   in RFCs, and it also appear unclear why the RFC Editor still add this
   text [7].


3.  Problem #2: No Rights To Use Modified Parts Of Contributions

   Implementation of IETF documents may want to reproduce part of the
   RFC in its online help, reference manual, source code comments or
   even in source code.  Material used in source code may include large
   tables (see StringPrep [4]) or ASN.1 schemas (see Kerberos 5 [5]).
   Material used in manuals may include protocol overviews (such as in
   SASL [2]) or API function documentation (such as in GSS-AP [3]).
   Currently, there are no rights granted to allow this usage.

   Further, when deciding on which license grants that should be used,
   to be able to be integrated in common free and open source projects,
   the license should be compatible with free software licenses (e.g.,
   the GNU Generic Public License and the GNU Free Documentation License
   [8]) and free software guidelines [9].


4.  Proposed Update

   This memo add the following as paragraph 3.3(c) of RFC 3978:


       c. The Contributor grants third parties the right to copy and
          distribute the Contribution, with or without modification, in
          any medium, without royalty, provided that the copyright
          notice and this notice are preserved, and that any claims of
          being the authoritative RFC are removed.
