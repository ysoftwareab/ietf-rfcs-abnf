   The signature uses a secp256r1 certificate within
   "https://example.com/".

   It relies on the "Digest" response header with the mi-sha256-03
   digest algorithm to guard the integrity of the response payload.
   The signature includes a "validity-url" that includes the first time
   the resource was seen.  This allows multiple versions of a resource
   at the same URL to be updated with new signatures, which allows
   clients to avoid transferring extra data while the old versions don't
   have known security bugs.

   The certificate at "https://example.com/certs" has a "subjectAltName"
   of "example.com", meaning that if it and its signature validate, the
   exchange can be trusted as having an origin of
   "https://example.com/".
