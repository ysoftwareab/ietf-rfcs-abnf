1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] introduces and explains Deterministic
   Networks (DetNet) architecture and how the Packet Replication and
   Elimination function (PREF) can be used to ensure low packet drop
   ratio in DetNet domain.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) protocols are used
   to detect, localize defects in the network, and monitor network
   performance.  Some OAM functions, e.g., failure detection, work in
   the network proactively, while others, e.g., defect localization,
   usually performed on-demand.  These tasks achieved by a combination
   of active and hybrid, as defined in [RFC7799], OAM methods.

   This document lists the functional requirements toward OAM for DetNet
   domain.  The list can further be used for gap analysis of available
   OAM tools to identify possible enhancements of existing or whether
   new OAM tools are required to support proactive and on-demand path
   monitoring and service validation.

Internet-Draft               OAM for DetNet                     May 2019


3.  Requirements

   This section lists requirements for OAM in DetNet domain:

   1.   The listed requirements MUST be supported for any type of
        underlay network over which a DetNet domain can be realized.

   2.   It MUST be possible to initiate DetNet OAM session from any
        DetNet node towards another DetNet node(s) within given domain.

   3.   It SHOULD be possible to initialize DetNet OAM session from a
        centralized controller.

   4.   DetNet OAM MUST support proactive and on-demand OAM monitoring
        and measurement methods.

   5.   DetNet OAM packets MUST be in-band, i.e., follow precisely the
        same path as DetNet data plane traffic both for unidirectional
        and bi-directional DetNet paths.

   6.   DetNet OAM MUST support unidirectional OAM methods, continuity
        check, connectivity verification, and performance measurement.

   7.   DetNet OAM MUST support bi-directional OAM methods.  Such OAM
        methods MAY combine in-band monitoring or measurement in the
        forward direction and out-of-bound notification in the reverse
        direction, i.e., from egress to ingress end point of the OAM
        test session.

   8.   DetNet OAM MUST support proactive monitoring of a DetNet node
        availability in the given DetNet domain.

   9.   DetNet OAM MUST support Path Maximum Transmission Unit
        discovery.

   10.  DetNet OAM MUST support Remote Defect Indication (RDI)
        notification to the DetNet node performing continuity checking.

   11.  DetNet OAM MUST support performance measurement methods.

   12.  DetNet OAM MAY support hybrid performance measurement methods.

   13.  DetNet OAM MUST support unidirectional performance measurement
        methods.  Calculated performance metrics MUST include but are
        not limited to throughput, packet loss, delay and delay
        variation metrics.  [RFC6374] provides excellent details on
        performance measurement and performance metrics.

   14.  DetNet OAM MUST support defect notification mechanism, like
        Alarm Indication Signal.  Any DetNet node in the given DetNet
        domain MAY originate a defect notification addressed to any
        subset of nodes within the domain.

   15.  DetNet OAM MUST support methods to enable survivability of the
        DetNet domain.  These recovery methods MAY use protection
        switching and restoration.

   16.  DetNet OAM MUST support the discovery of Packet Replication,
        Elimination, and Order preservation sub-functions locations in
        the domain.

   17.  DetNet OAM MUST support testing of Packet Replication,
        Elimination, and Order preservation sub-functions in the domain.

   18.  DetNet OAM MUST support monitoring any sub-set of paths
        traversed through the DetNet domain by the DetNet flow.

4.  DetNet Data Plane in Support of Active OAM

   OAM protocols and mechanisms act within the data plane of the
   particular networking layer.  And thus it is critical that the data
   plane encapsulation supports OAM mechanisms in such a way to comply
   with the above-listed requirements.  One of such examples that
   require special consideration is requirement #5:

      DetNet OAM packets MUST be in-band, i.e., follow precisely the
      same path as DetNet data plane traffic both for unidirectional and
      bi-directional DetNet paths.

4.1.  MPLS Encapsulation

   The Det Net data plane encapsulation in transport network with MPLS
   and IP encapsulations specified in [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls] and
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-ip] respectively.  For the MPLS underlay
   network, DetNet flows to be encapsulated analogous to pseudowires
   (PW) over MPLS packet switched network, as described in [RFC3985],
   [RFC4385].  Generic PW MPLS Control Word (CW), defined in [RFC4385],
   for DetNet displayed in Figure 1.

   PREF in the DetNet domain composed by a combination of nodes that
   perform replication and elimination sub-functions.  The elimination
   sub-function always uses the S-Label and packet sequencing
   information, e.g., the value in the Sequence Number field of DetNet
   CW (d-CW).  The replication sub-function uses the S-Label information
   only.  For data packets Figure 2 presents an example of PREF in
   DetNet domain.

             Figure 4: DetNet Associated Channel Header Format

   Figure 4 displays the format of the DetNet Associated Channel Header
   (d-ACH).  The meanings of the fields in the d-ACH are:

      Bits 0..3 MUST be 0b0001.  This value of the first nibble allows
      the packet to be distinguished from an IP packet [RFC4928] and a
      DetNet data packet [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls].

      Version: this is the version number of the d-ACH.  This
      specification defines version 0.

      Sequence Number: this is unsigned eight bits-long field.  The
      originating DetNet node MUST set the value of the Sequence Number
      field to a non-zero before packet being transmitted.  The
      originating node MUST monotonically increase the value of the
      Sequence Number field for the every next active OAM packet.

      Channel Type: the value of DetNet Associated Channel Type is one
      of values defined in the IANA PW Associated Channel Type registry.

Internet-Draft               OAM for DetNet                     May 2019


   The DetNet flow, according to [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls], is
   identified by the S-label that MUST be at the bottom of the stack.
   Active OAM packet MUST have d-ACH immediately following the S-label.A
   DetNet node originating an OAM packet MUST ensure that the value of
   the Sequence Number field in d-ACH is monotonically increasing for
   the given value of the Channel Type field.

   The Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL), defined in [RFC5586] and
   [RFC6423], provides a generalized label-based exception mechanism to
   indicate that the packet is on a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)
   and that ACH immediately follows the label stack.  For the DetNet
   domain in MPLS transport network, GAL MAY be used.  If GAL is used,
   it MUST precede S-Label on the label stack, and the S-Label MUST be
   followed by d-ACH.

4.1.2.  IP Encapsulation

   [Author's Note: This will be defined based on the DetNet Flow ID
   specification for IP underlay in [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-ip].]

4.2.  DetNet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Sub-functions
      Interaction with Active OAM

   At the DetNet service layer, special functions MAY be applied to the
   particular DetNet flow - PREF to potentially lower packet loss,
   improve the probability of on-time packet delivery and Packet
   Ordering Function (POF) to ensure in-order packet delivery.  As data
   and the active OAM packets have the same Flow ID, S-label, sub-
   functions that rely on sequencing information in the DetNet service
   layer MUST process 28 MSBs of the d-ACH as the source of the
   sequencing information for the OAM packet.

5.  Use of Hybrid OAM in DetNet

   Hybrid OAM methods are used in performance monitoring and defined in
   [RFC7799] as:

      Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination
      of Active Methods and Passive Methods.

   A hybrid measurement method may produce metrics as close to passive,
   but it still alters something in a data packet even if that is the
   value of a designated field in the packet encapsulation.  One example
   of such a hybrid measurement method is the Alternate Marking method
   described in [RFC8321].  Reserving the field for the Alternate
   Marking method in the DetNet Header will enhance available to an
   operator set of DetNet OAM tools.
