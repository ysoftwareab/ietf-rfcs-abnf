 1. Abstract 
     
    This draft proposes a standardized set of sub-application (SAPP) 
    identifiers for real-time application, namely, audio, video and telephony 
    (voice and fax) applications.  These SAPP identifiers are used in the 
    RSVP Identity Policy Element in the Policy Data Object [RFC 2750].  The 
    standardized set of SAPP identifiers proposed in this draft facilitate 
    the deployment of policy-enabled, real-time applications. 
     
          
 2. Introduction 
     
    The Identity Policy Element (PE) is part of the Policy Data Object [RFC 
    2750] which may be included in RSVP [RFC 2205] signaling messages.

    Policy elements with a P-type of AUTH_APP are used to identify 
    applications and their attributes as defined in [RFC 2752]. 
     
    The usage and format of the PE for application identification is defined 
    in [RFC 2753].  Policy Management Systems may use this application 
    identification information to apply appropriate policy decisions to 
    network elements under their control for different traffic flows.   
     
    Many types of real-time applications, such as IP telephony, video and 
    streaming audio, are difficult to classify.  This is because they do not 
    use well-known, standardized port numbers or do not have standardized 
    protocol IDs.  Furthermore, devices can send multiple types of traffic, 
    each requiring different treatment by the network so classifying only on 
    the source IP address is insufficient.  SAPP can be used to distinguish 
    between these different traffic types by providing standardized names to 
    define the sub-application type.   A Network Manager can use these 
    standardized SAPP identifiers to facilitate the creation and deployment 
    of application-based policies. 
          
    Finally, SAPP may be use in conjunction with other RSVP objects, e.g., 
    Flowspec and Filterspec, to allow a policy server (PDP) to make more 
    informed policy decisions on the traffic to be sent to the network.  
     
     
 3. Standardized Set of Sub-Application IDs 
     
    RFC 2872 provides some examples for Sub-application (SAPP) 
    identification.  These attributes are provided in the Policy Locator 
    attribute field in the Policy Element.  To facilitate interoperability, a 
    standardized set of SAPP identifiers are provided in the next sections.  
    Many of the SAPP identifiers used are defined in [RTP Profile].  
          
    The sub-application (SAPP) identifiers described in the next sub-sections 
    consist of audio, voice, fax and video.  Each of these has additional 
    SAPP identifiers that provide additional descriptors used to further 
    identify the application. 
                          
 3.1. Audio 
     
    Audio SAPP identifiers must include one codec and may include one or more 
    additional SAPP identifiers.  The focus of these audio SAPP identifiers 
    is for use in real-time, streaming audio applications such as Internet 
    radio or music broadcasts.  However, these audio SAPP identifiers may 
    also be used for the identification of other audio applications.  
          
        SAPP=Audio  
          
        SAPP=MP1-32  
        SAPP=MP1-44.1  
        SAPP=MP1-48  
        SAPP=MP2-16

                draft-santitoro-rap-policy-appids-01.txt        November 2000 
  
  
        SAPP=MP2-22.05  
        SAPP=MP2-24  
        SAPP=MP2-32  
        SAPP=MP2-44.1  
        SAPP=MP2-48  
        SAPP=MP3-32  
        SAPP=MP3-44.1  
        SAPP=MP3-48  
          
    This example specifies a 44.1Khz MP3 (MPEG-3) audio file playing on an 
    MP3 Player.  
          
    Example:  APP=MP3 Player SAPP=Audio, SAPP=MP3-44.1  
     
 3.2 Voice 
     
    Voice SAPP identifiers must include at least one codec and may include 
    one or more additional SAPP identifiers.  When a VAD (Voice Activity 
    Detection) SAPP, which includes silence suppression, is included, it 
    indicates that VAD is supported.  If the VAD SAPP is not included then it 
    indicates that VAD is not supported.  
          
    While a voice application may be considered an audio application, this 
    document  has separated them because there are unique differences between 
    the two. Voice applications are interactive and as such are more latency     
    sensitive than audio applications.  A network administrator will apply 
    different policies that will take this into account and hence this     
    difference is of interest in the policy decisions made by the PDPs Policy 
    Decision Points) and PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) network elements     
    enforcing the traffic.    
          
        SAPP=Voice  
          
        SAPP=G.711  
        SAPP=G.729  
        SAPP=G.728  
        SAPP=G.722  
        SAPP=G.723.1  
        SAPP=G.726-40  
        SAPP=G.726-32  
        SAPP=G.726-24  
        SAPP=G.726-16  
        SAPP=GSM6.10  
        SAPP=GSM6.90  
        SAPP=GSM-HR  
        SAPP=GSM-EFR  
          
        SAPP=VAD 
          
    In this example, the IP Phone indicates that it will use the G.729 codec 
    with VAD (Voice Activity Detection) enabled (and hence, silence 
    suppression enabled) for a voice call.

    Example:  APP=IP Phone, SAPP=Voice, SAPP=G.729, SAPP=VAD 
     
 3.3. Fax 
  
    There are two predominant ITU-T IP-based Fax standards, namely, T.38 and     
    T.37.  The SAPP identifiers for fax must include the standard it is using 
    (T.38 or T.37) and at least one modulation scheme.  
          
        SAPP=Fax  
          
        SAPP=T.38  
        SAPP=T.37  
          
        SAPP=V.90  
        SAPP=V.34  
        SAPP=V.17  
        SAPP=V.29  
        SAPP=V.27  
          
    In this example, an IP Telephony (IPT) Gateway indicates that it will 
    initiate a T.38 real-time fax call using the V.17 (14.4kbps) modulation     
    scheme.  
          
    Example:  APP=IPT Gateway, SAPP=Fax, SAPP=T.38, SAPP=V.17  
     
 3.4. Video 
     
    The following video picture format terminology is used in this section: 
     
      CIF: Common Intermediate Format.  352 x 288 pixels. 
     QCIF: Quarter CIF.  176 x 144 pixels. 
    SQCIF: Sub-QCIF.  128 x 96 pixels. 
     4CIF: 704 x 576 pixels. 
    16CIF: 1408 x 1152 pixels. 
     
    Video SAPP identifiers consist of the codec including the video window 
    size specified in the standard CIF (Common Intermediate Format) format.  
    This provides the PDP with more information on the type of video (window 
    size) to be sent over the network.  A network administrator, for example, 
    may only allow an application to send H.263-QCIF video over expensive 
    wide area connections but allow H.263-CIF video over high bandwidth 
    campus LAN connections.  
         
        SAPP=Video  
          
        SAPP=H.261-CIF  
        SAPP=H.261-QCIF  
        SAPP=H.263-CIF  
        SAPP=H.263-QCIF  
        SAPP=H.263-SQCIF  
        SAPP=H.263-4CIF

        SAPP=H.263-16QCIF  
        SAPP=MPEG-1  
        SAPP=MPEG-2  
     
          
    This example represents a Quarter Common Intermediate Format (QCIF) frame 
    of H.261-encoded video to be played on a Media Player.  
          
    Example:  APP=Media Player, SAPP=Video, SAPP=H.261-QCIF  
  

 4. Security Considerations 
  
    The identity policy element does not guarantee any association with the 
    application initiating it.  However, the identity policy element can be 
    part of same RSVP message that contains the POLICY_DATA object [RFC 2750] 
    which can be used to authenticate users and applications.
