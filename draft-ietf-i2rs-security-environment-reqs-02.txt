Abstract

   This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS
   architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of
   the protocol used for I2RS.  The I2RS protocol security requirements
   set the security for the communication between I2RS client and agent
   while the security environment requirements are rather intended for
   deployment or implementations features independent of the I2RS
   protocol.  The environmental security requirements described in this
   document provide the good security practices to be used with the I2RS
   protocol so that I2RS protocol implementations can be securely
   deployed and operated.

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS
   architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of
   the protocol used for I2RS.  The I2RS protocol security requirements
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements] set the security for
   the communication between I2RS client and agent while the security
   environment requirements are rather intended for deployment or
   implementations features independent of the I2RS protocol.  The
   environmental security requirements described in this document
   provide the good security practices to be used with the I2RS protocol
   so that I2RS protocol implementations can be securely deployed and
   operate.  These environment security address the security
   considerations for I2RS protocol environment considered in the I2RS
   Architecture [RFC7921] in order to provide a stable and secure
   environment in which the dynamic programmatic interface to the
   routing system (I2RS) should operates.

   Even though the I2RS protocol is mostly concerned with the interface
   between the I2RS client and the I2RS agent, the environmental
   security requirements must consider the entire I2RS architecture and
   specify where security functions may be hosted and what criteria
   should be met in order to address any new attack vectors exposed by
   deploying this architecture.  Environment security for I2RS has to be
   considered the complete I2RS architecture and not only on the
   protocol interface.

   This document is structured as follows:

   o  Section 2 describes the terminology used in this document,

   o  Section 3 describes how the I2RS plane can be contained or
      isolated from existing management plane, control plane and
      forwarding plane.

   o  the subsequent sections of the document focuses on the security
      within the I2RS plane including:

      *  Section 4 analyzes how the I2RS access control policies can be
         deployed throughout the I2RS plane in order to only grant
         access to the routing system resources to authorized components
         with the authorized privileges.  This includes providing a
         robust communication system between the components.

      *  Section 5 details how I2RS keeps applications isolated from
         another and without affecting the I2RS components.
         applications may be independent, with different scopes, owned

         by different tenants.  In addition, the applications may modify
         the routing system in an automatic way.

   Motivations are placed before the requirements are given.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the I2RS problem statement
   [RFC7920], I2RS architecture, [RFC7921], traceability requirements
   [RFC7922], I2RS Pub/Sub requirements [RFC7923], I2RS ephemeral state
   requirements [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state], I2RS protocol security
   requirements [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].

2.  Terminology and Acronyms

   - Environment Security Requirements :   Security requirements
         specifying how the environment a protocol operates in needs to
         be secure.  These requirements do not specify the protocol
         security requirements.

   - I2RS plane:   The environment the I2RS process is running on.  It
         includes the applications, the I2RS client and the I2RS agent.

   - I2RS user:   The user of the I2RS client software or system.

   - I2RS access control policies:   policies controlling access of the
         routing resources by applications.  These policies are divided
         into policies applied by the I2RS client regarding applications
         and policies applied by the I2RS agent regarding I2RS clients.

   - I2RS client access control policies:   The access control policies
         processed by the I2RS client.

   - I2RS agent access control policies:   The access control policies
         processed by the I2RS agent.

2.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  I2RS Plane Isolation

   Isolating the I2RS plane from other network planes (the management,
   forwarding plane, and control planes ) is fundamental to the security
   of the I2RS environment.  Clearly differentiating I2RS components
   from the rest of the network device does the following:

   1.  protects the I2RS components from vulnerabilities in other parts
       of the network, and

   2.  protects other systems vital to the health of the network from
       vulnerabilities in the I2RS plane.

   Separating the I2RS plane from other network control and forwarding
   planes is similar to the best common practice of containerizing
   software into modules.  However, the I2RS plane cannot be considered
   as completely isolated from other planes so the interactions between
   the I2RS plane and other planes should be identified and controlled.
   The following is a brief description of how the I2RS plane positions
   itself in regard to the other planes.

3.1.  I2RS Plane and Management plane

   The purpose of the I2RS plane is to provide a standard programmatic
   interface of the routing system resources to network oriented
   applications.  The control plane and forwarding planes are related to
   routing protocols, and I2RS is positioned on top of the control plane
   and forwarding plane.  The management plane is usually vendor
   specific and provides a broader control over the networking equipment
   such as system service.  Given the management plane's associated
   privileges it is expected to be reserved to highly trusted users like
   network administrators.

   The I2RS plane and the management plane both interact with several
   common elements on forwarding and packet processing devices.
   [RFC7921] describes several of these interaction points such as the
   local configuration, the static system state, routing, and signaling.
   A routing resource may be accessed by different means (APIs,
   applications) and different planes which creates potential overlaps.
   Southbound APIs are often provided to limit the scope of the
   management plane's and the I2RS plane's interaction with the routing
   resources (as figure 1 shows).  If there are conflicts in these
   overlapping southbound APIs, the conflicts should be resolved in a
   deterministic way.

      +------------------------------------------+

      Figure 1 - North Bound (NB) APIs and
                 South Bound (SB) APIs

   The I2RS applications may be provided with a northbound API by the
   I2RS client (as figure 1 shows).  Similarly, the management plane may
   provide a northbound API to management application.  The northbound
   API from the management plane to the client application and the
   northbound API from the I2RS plane to I2RS applications may overlap.
   In case that these overlapping APIs between the have conflicts (e.g.
   both want to access the same routing resource), the the conflicts
   should be resolved in a deterministic way.

   To resolve conflicts in a northbound APIs, the deterministic
   resolution should have clear rules about which data plane with a
   system takes precedence (wins during a conflict for resources).  This
   is important to prevent attacks that attempt to drive the two systems
   into deadlock situation over which system has precedence (wins)

   In the interactions between the I2RS plane and the applications, and
   the management plane and the application is it important to prevent
   the following things:

   o  the I2RS system "infecting" the management system with bad
      information,

   o  the management system "infecting" the I2RS system with bad
      information directly,

   o  the management system indirectly "infecting" the I2RS system by
      propagating improproper information from one system to another via
      I2RS.

   Prevention:

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   The primary protection in this space is going to need to be
   validation rules on the data being sent/receive, notification of
   changes that the I2RS agent sends the client, and other access
   protections.

   In this circumstance, we define "infecting" as inteferring with and
   leading into a incoherent state.  The I2RS plane may update a routing
   resource configured by the management plane, or the reverse (the
   management plane updates a resource the I2RS plane has configured).
   Indirect "infecting", we define as as changes made by the I2RS plane
   that cause changes in routing protocols which add state unexpected by
   the management plane or the reverse (the mangement plane adding
   changes in routing protocols the I2RS plane does not expect).

3.2.  I2RS Plane and Forwarding Plane

   Applications hosted by the I2RS client belong to the I2RS plane.  It
   is difficult to constrained these applications to the I2RS plane, or
   even to limit their scope within the I2RS plane.  Applications using
   I2RS may also interact with components outside the I2RS plane.  For
   example an application may use an I2RS client to configure the
   network or monitored events via an I2RS agent on a single machine, or
   multiple I2RS agents each on a single machine.

   Applications may also communicate with multiple I2RS clients in order
   to have a broader view of the current and potential states of the
   network and the I2RS plane itself.  These varied remote communication
   relationships between applications using the I2RS protocol to change
   the forwarding plane make it possible for an individual application
   to be an effective attack vector against the operation of the
   network, a router's I2RS plane, the forwarding plane of the routing
   system, and other planes (management and control planes).

   Prevention measures:

   Systems should consider the following prevention errors:

   application validation -  There is little the I2RS plane can do to
      validate applications with which it interacts.  The I2RS client
      passes the I2RS agent an opaque identifier for the application so
      that an application's actions can be traced back to the
      application.

   Validation against common misconfigurations or errors -  One way of
      securing the interfaces between application, the I2RS plane, and
      the forwarding plane is to limit the information accepted and to
      limit the rate information is accepted between these three

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


      software planes.  Another method is to performing rudimentary
      checks on the results of any updates to the forwarding plane.

3.3.  I2RS Plane and Control Plane

   The network control plane consists of the processes and protocols
   that discover topology, advertise reachability, and determine the
   shortest path between any location on the network and any
   destination.  I2RS client configures, monitors or receives events via
   the I2RS agent's interaction with the routing system including the
   process that handling the control plane signaling protocols (BGP,
   ISIS, OSPF, etc.), route information databases (RIBs), and interface
   databases.  In some situation to manage an network outage or to
   control traffic, the I2RS protocol may modify information in the
   route database or the configuration of routing process.  While this
   is not a part of normal processing, such action that allows the
   network operator to bypass temporary outages or DoS attacks.

   This capability to modify the routing process information carries
   with it the risk that the I2RS agent may alter the normal properties
   of the routing protocols which provide normal loop free routing in
   the control plane.  The information configured by the I2RS agent into
   routing process or RIBs could cause problems, or state which is
   inserted or deleted from routing processes (control traffic,
   counters, etc.) could cause the control plan to fail to converge or
   fail).

   Prevention measures:

   The I2RS system can provide checks that during and after the problem
   has been resolved that loop free routing is preserved.  These checks
   should check the preservation of all facets of routing including the
   following: routing with loop free alternates, tunnelled interfaces,
   virtual overlays, and other such constructions.

3.4.  Requirements

   To isolate I2RS transactions from other planes, it is required that:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 1:  application-to-routing system resources
                   communications should use an isolated communication
                   channel.  Various level of isolation can be
                   considered.  The highest level of isolation may be
                   provided by using a physically isolated network.
                   Alternatives may also consider logical isolation
                   (e.g. using vLAN).  In a virtual environment that
                   shares a common infrastructure, encryption may also
                   be used as a way to enforce isolation.  Encryption

                   can be added by using a secure transport required by
                   the I2RS protocol security
                   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements], and
                   sending the non-confidential I2RS data (designed for
                   a non-secure transport) over a secure transport.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 2:  The interface used by the routing element to receive
                   I2RS transactions via the I2RS protocol (e.g. the IP
                   address) should be a dedicated physical or logical
                   interface.  As previously, mentioned a dedicated
                   physical interface may contribute to a higher
                   isolation.  Isolation may also be achieved by using a
                   dedicated IP address or a dedicated port.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 3:  An I2RS agent should have permissions separate from
                   any other entity (for example any internal system
                   management processes or CLI processes).

   Explanation:

   When the I2RS agent performs an action on a routing element, the
   action is performed via process(es) associated to a routing process.

   For example, in a typical UNIX system, the user is designated with a
   user id (uid) and belongs to groups designated by group ids (gid).
   If such a user id (uid) and group id (gid) is the identifier for the
   routing processes peforming routing tasks in the control plane, then
   the I2RS Agent process would communicate with these routing
   processes.  It is important that the I2RS agent has its own unique
   identifier and the routing processes have their own identifier so
   that access control can unique filter data between the processes.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 4:  I2RS plane should be informed when a routing system
                   resource is modified by a user outside the I2RS plane
                   access.  Notifications from the control plane SHOULD
                   not to flood the I2RS plane, and rate limiting (or
                   summarization) is expected to be applied.  These
                   routing system notification MAY translated to the
                   appropriate I2RS agent notifications, and passed to
                   various I2RS clients via notification relays.  (This
                   requirements is also described in section 7.6 of
                   [RFC7921] for the I2RS client, and this section
                   extends it to the entire I2RS plane (I2RS agent,
                   client, and application).

   I2RS resource may be shared with the management plane and the control
   plane.  The I2RS routing system resource management is limited to the
   I2RS plane.  As such, update of I2RS routing system outside of the
   I2RS plane may remain unnoticed unless and until explicitly notified
   to the I2RS plane.  Such notification is expected to trigger
   synchronization of the I2RS resource state within each I2RS
   component.  This guarantees that I2RS resource are maintained in a
   coherent state among the I2RS plane.  In addition, depending on the
   I2RS resource that is updated as well as the origin of the
   modification performed, the I2RS access control policies may be
   impacted.  Further an I2RS client is more likely to update an I2RS
   resources that has been updated by itself, then by the management
   plane.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 5:  I2RS plane should define an "I2RS plane overwrite
                   policy".  Such policy defines how an I2RS is able to
                   update and overwrite a resource set by a user outside
                   the I2RS plane.  Such hierarchy has been described in
                   section 6.3 and 7.8 of [RFC7921]

   Explanation:

   A key part of the I2RS architecture is notification regarding routing
   system changes across the I2RS plane (I2RS client to/from I2RS
   agent).  The security environment requirements above (SEC-ENV-REQ-03
   to SEC-ENV-REQ-05) provide the assurance that the I2RS plane and the
   routing systems the I2RS plane attaches to remains untouched by the
   other planes or the I2RS plane is notificed of such changes.
   Section 6.3 of [RFC7921] describes how the I2RS agent within the I2RS
   plane interacts with forwarding plane's local configuration, and
   provides the example of an overwrite policy between the I2RS plane
   and local configuration (instantiated in 2 Policy Knobs) that
   operators may wish to set.  The prompt notification of any outside
   overwrite is key to the architecture and proper interworking of the
   I2RS Plane.

4.  I2RS Access Control for Routing System Resources

   This section provides recommendations on how I2RS access control
   policies associated to the routing system resources.  These policies
   only apply within the I2RS plane.  More especially, the policies are
   associated to the applications, I2RS clients and I2RS agents, with
   their associated identity and roles.

   The I2RS deployment of I2RS applications, I2RS clients, and I2RS
   agents can be located locally in a closed environment or distributed
   over open networks.  The normal case for routing system management is
   over an open environment.  Even in a closed environment access

   control policies should be carefully defined to be able to, in the
   future to carefully extend the I2RS plane to remote applications or
   remote I2RS clients.

   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements] defines the security
   requirements of the I2RS protocol between the I2RS client and the
   I2RS agent over a secure transport.  This section focuses on I2RS
   access control architecture (section 5.1), access control policies of
   the I2RS agent (section 5.2), the I2RS client (section 5.3), and the
   application (section 5.4).

4.1.  I2RS Access Control Architecture

   Overview:

   Applications access to routing system resource via numerous
   intermediaries nodes.  The application communicates with an I2RS
   client.  In some cases, the I2RS client is only associated to a
   single application attached to one or more agents (case a and case b
   in figure 2 below).  In other cases, the I2RS client may be connected
   to two applications (case c in figure 2 below), or the I2RS may act
   as a broker (agent/client device shown in case d in the figure 2
   below).  The I2RS client broker approach provides scalability to the
   I2RS architecture as it avoids that each application be registered to
   the I2RS agent.  Similarly, the I2RS access control should be able to
   scale numerous applications.

   The goal of the security environment requirements in this section are
   to control the interactions between the applications and the I2RS
   client, and the interactions between the I2RS client and the I2RS
   agent.  The key challenge is that the I2RS architecture puts the I2RS
   Client in control of the stream of communication (application to I2RS
   client and I2RS client to the I2RS agent).  The I2RS agent must trust
   the I2RS client's actions without having an ability to verify the
   I2RS client's actions.

4.1.1.  access control Enforcement Scope

   SEC-ENV-REQ 6:  I2RS access control should be performed through the
                   whole I2RS plane.  It should not be enforced by the
                   I2RS agent only within the routing element.  Instead,



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


                   the I2RS client should enforce the I2RS client access
                   control against applications and the I2RS agent
                   should enforce the I2RS agent access control against
                   the I2RS clients.  The mechanisms for the I2RS client
                   access control are not in scope of the I2RS
                   architecture [RFC7921], which exclusively focuses on
                   the I2RS agent access control provided by the I2RS
                   protocol.

   Explanation:

   This architecture results in a layered and hierarchical or multi-
   party I2RS access control.  An application will be able to access a
   routing system resource only if both the I2RS client is granted
   access by the I2RS agent and the application is granted access by the
   I2RS client.

4.1.2.  Notification Requirements

   SEC-ENV-REQ 7:  When an access request to a routing resource is
                   refused by one party (the I2RS client or the I2RS
                   agent), the requester (e.g the application) as well
                   as all intermediaries should indicate the reason the
                   access has not been granted, and which entity
                   rejected the request.

   Explanation:

   In case the I2RS client access control or the I2RS agent access
   control does not grant access to a routing system resource, the
   application should be able to determine whether its request has been
   rejected by the I2RS client or the I2RS agent as well as the reason
   that caused the reject.

   SEC-REQ-07 indicates the I2RS agent may reject the request because
   the I2RS client is not an authorized I2RS client or have enough
   privileges to perform the requested transaction (read, write, start
   notifications or logging).  The I2RS client should be notified of the
   reason the I2RS agent rejected the transaction due to a lack of
   authorization or priviledges, and the I2RS client should return a
   message to the application indicating the I2RS agent reject the
   transacation with an indication of this reason.  Similarly, if the
   I2RS client does not grant the access to the application, the I2RS
   client should also inform the application.  An example of an error
   message could be, "Read failure: you do not have the read
   permission", "Write failure: you do not have write permission", or
   "Write failure: resource accessed by someone else".

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   This requirement has been written in a generic manner as it concerns
   the following interactions:

   o  interactions between the application and the I2RS client,

   o  interactions between the I2RS client and the I2RS agent (security
      requirements are described by
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements]),

   o  and interactions between the I2RS agent and the I2RS routing
      system (forwarding plane, control plane, and routing plane).

4.1.3.  Trust

   SEC-ENV-REQ 8:  In order to provide coherent access control policies
                   enforced by multiple parties (e.g. the I2RS client or
                   the I2RS agent), theses parties should trust each
                   others, and communication between them should also be
                   trusted (e.g.  TLS) in order to reduce additional
                   vector of attacks.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 9:  I2RS client or I2RS agent SHOULD also be able to
                   refuse a communication with an application or an I2RS
                   client when the communication channel does not
                   fulfill enough security requirements.

   Explanation:

   The participants in the I2RS Plane (I2RS client, I2RS agent, and I2RS
   application) exchange critical information, and to be effective the
   communication should be trusted and free from security attacks.

   The I2RS client or the I2RS agent should be able to reject messages
   over a communication channel that can be easily hijacked, like a
   clear text UDP channel.

4.1.4.  Sharing access control Information

   For the I2RS client:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 10: The I2RS client MAY request information on its I2RS
                   access control subset policies from the I2RS agent or
                   cache requests that have been rejected by the I2RS
                   agent to limit forwarding unnecessary queries to the
                   I2RS agent.

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   SEC-ENV-REQ 11: The I2RS client MAY support receiving notifications
                   when its I2RS access control subset policies have
                   been updated by the I2RS agent.

   Similarly, for the applications:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 12: The applications MAY request information on its I2RS
                   access control subset policies in order to limit
                   forwarding unnecessary queries to the I2RS client.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 13: The applications MAY subscribe to a service that
                   provides notification when its I2RS access control
                   subset policies have been updated.

   For both the application and the client:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 14: The I2RS access control should explicitly specify
                   accesses that are granted.  More specifically,
                   anything not explicitly granted should be denied
                   (default rule).

   Explanation:

   In order to limit the number of access requests that result in an
   error, each application or I2RS client can retrieve the I2RS access
   control policies that applies to it.  This subset of rules is
   designated as the "Individual I2RS access control policies".  As
   these policies are subject to changes, a dynamic synchronization
   mechanism should be provided.  However, such mechanism may be
   implemented with different level of completeness and dynamicity of
   the individual I2RS access control policies.  One example, may be
   caching transaction requests that have been rejected.

   I2RS access control should be appropriately be balanced between the
   I2RS client and the I2RS agent.  It remains relatively easy to avoid
   the complete disclosure of the access control policies of the I2RS
   agent.  Relative disclosure of access control policies may allow the
   leaking confidential information in case of misconfiguration.  It is
   important to balance the level of trust of the I2RS client and the
   necessity of distributing the enforcement of the access control
   policies.

   I2RS access control should not solely rely only on the I2RS client or
   the I2RS agent as illustrated below:

   - 1) I2RS clients are dedicated to a single application:   In this
         case, it is likely that I2RS access control is enforced only by
         the I2RS agent, as the I2RS client is likely to accept all



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


         access request of the application.  It is recommended that even
         in this case, I2RS client access control is not based on an
         "Allow anything from application" policy, but instead the I2RS
         client specifies accesses that are enabled.  In addition, the
         I2RS client may sync its associated I2RS access control
         policies with the I2RS agent to limit the number of refused
         access requests being sent to the I2RS agent.  The I2RS client
         is expected to balance benefits and problems with synchronizing
         its access control policies with the I2RS agent to proxy
         request validation versus simply passing the access request to
         the I2RS agent.

   - 2) A single I2RS client connects to multiple applications or
   acts as a broker for many applications:
            In the case the I2RS agent has a single I2RS client
            attached.  This may end up in a situation where the I2RS
            client is being delegated by the I2RS agent to enforce
            access control policies.  In such as case, the I2RS agent
            may grant the I2RS client with high priviledges and blidngly
            trust the I2RS client without enforcing access control
            policies on what the I2RS client can do.  Such a situation
            must be avoided as it could be used by malicious
            applications for a priviledge escalation by compromising the
            I2RS client.  In this situation, the application uses the
            I2RS client to perform some action on behalf of the
            application that it normally does not have the priviledges
            to perform.  In order to mitigate such attack, the I2RS
            client that connects to multiple applications or operates as
            a broker is expected to host application with an equivalent
            level of privileges.

4.1.5.  Sharing Access Control in Groups of I2RS Clients and Agents

   Overview:

   To distribute the I2RS access control policies between I2RS clients
   and I2RS agents, I2RS access control policies can also be distributed
   within a set of I2RS clients or a set of I2RS agents.

   Requirements:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 15: I2RS clients should be distributed and act as brokers
                   for applications that share roughly similar
                   permissions.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 16: I2RS agents should be avoided granting extra
                   privileges to their authorized I2RS client.  I2RS
                   agent should be shared by I2RS client with roughly



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


                   similar permissions.  More explicitly, an I2RS agent
                   shared between I2RS clients that are only provided
                   read access to the routing system resources does not
                   need to perform any write access, so the I2RS client
                   should not be provided these accesses.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 17: I2RS client and I2RS agent should be able to trace
                   [RFC7922] the various transaction they perform as
                   well as suspicious activities.  These logs should be
                   collected regularly and analyzed by functions that
                   may be out of the I2RS plane.

   Explanation:

   This restriction for distributed I2RS clients to act as brokers only
   for applications with roughly the same priviledges avoids the I2RS
   client extra priviledges compared to hosted applications, and
   discourages applications from perform privilege escalation within an
   I2RS client.  For example, suppose an I2RS client requires write
   access to the resources.  It is not recommended to grant the I2RS
   agent the write access in order to satisfy a unique I2RS client.
   Instead, the I2RS client that requires write access should be
   connected to a I2RS agent that is already shared by I2RS client that
   requires a write access.

   Access control policies enforcement should be monitored in order to
   detect violation of the policies or detect an attack.  Access control
   policies enforcement may not be performed by the I2RS client or the
   I2RS agent as violation may require a more global view of the I2RS
   access control policies.  As a result, consistency check and
   mitigation may instead be performed by the management plane.
   However, I2RS clients and I2RS agents play a central role.

   The I2RS agent can trace transactions that an I2RS client requests it
   to perform, and to link this to the application via the secondary
   opaque identifier to the application.  This information is placed in
   a tracing log which is retrieved by management processes.  If a
   particular application is granted a level of priviledges it should
   not have, then this tracing mechanism may detect this security
   intrusion after the instrusion has occurred.

4.1.6.  Managing Access Control Policy

   Access control policies should be implemented so that the policies
   remain manageable in short and longer term deployments of the I2RS
   protocol and the I2RS plane.

   Requirements:



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   SEC-ENV-REQ 18: access control should be managed in an automated way,
                   that is granting or revoking an application should
                   not involve manual configuration over the I2RS plane
                   (I2RS client, I2RS agent, and application).

   Explanation:

   Granting or configuring an application with new policy should not
   require manual configuration of I2RS clients, I2RS agents, or other
   applications.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 19: Access control should be scalable when the number of
                   application grows as well as when the number of I2RS
                   client increases.

   Explanation:

   A typical implementation of a local I2RS client access control
   policies may result in creating manually a system user associated to
   each application.  Such an approach is likely not to scale when the
   number of applications increases or the number of

   SEC-ENV-REQ 20: Access control should be dynamically managed and
                   easily updated.

   Explanation:

   Although the numberof I2RS clients is expected to be lower than the
   number of application, as I2RS agent provide access to the routing
   resource, it is of primary importance that an access can be granted
   or revoke in an efficient way.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 21: I2RS clients and I2RS agents should be uniquely
                   identified in the network to enable centralized
                   management of the I2RS access control policies.

   Explanation:

   Centralized management of the access control policies of an I2RS
   plane with network that hosts several I2RS applications, clients and
   agents requires that each devices can be identified.

4.2.  I2RS Agent Access Control Policies

   Overview:

   The I2RS agent access control restricts the routing system resource
   access to authorized identities - possible access policies may be



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   none, read or write.  The initiator of an access request to a routing
   resource is always an application.  However, it remains challenging
   for the I2RS agent to establish its access control policies based on
   the application that initiates the request.

   First, when an I2RS client acts as a broker, the I2RS agent may not
   be able to authenticate the application.  In that sense, the I2RS
   agent relies on the capability of the I2RS client to authenticate the
   applications and apply the appropriated I2RS client access control.

   Second, an I2RS agent may not uniquely identify a piece of software
   implementing an I2RS client.  In fact, an I2RS client may be provided
   multiple identities which can be associated to different roles or
   privileges.  The I2RS client is left responsible for using them
   appropriately according to the application.

   Third, each I2RS client may contact various I2RS agent with different
   privileges and access control policies.

4.2.1.  I2RS Agent Access Control

   This section provides recommendations on the I2RS agent access
   control policies to keep I2RS access control coherent within the I2RS
   plane.

   Requirements:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 22: I2RS agent access control policies should be
                   primarily based on the I2RS clients as described in
                   [RFC7921].

   SEC-ENV-REQ 23: I2RS agent access control policies MAY be based on
                   the application if the application identity has been
                   authenticated by the I2RS client and passed via the
                   secondary identity to the I2RS agent.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 24: The I2RS agent should know which identity (E.g.
                   system user) performed the latest update of the
                   routing resource.  This is true for an identity
                   inside and outside the I2RS plane so the I2RS agent
                   can appropriately perform an update according to the
                   priorities associated to the requesting identity and
                   the identity that last updated the resource.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 25: the I2RS agent should have a "I2RS agent overwrite
                   Policy" that indicates how identities can be
                   prioritized.  This requirements is also described in
                   section 7.6 of [RFC7921].  Similar requirements exist

                   for components within the I2RS plane, but this is
                   within the scope of the I2RS protocol security
                   requirements
                   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].

   Explanation:

   If the I2RS application is authenticated to the I2RS client, and the
   I2RS client is authenticated to the I2RS agent, and the I2RS client
   uses the opaque secondary identifier to pass an authenticated
   identifier to the I2RS agent, this may be used for access control.
   However, caution should be taken when using this chain of
   authentication since the secondary identifier is intended in the I2RS
   protocol for tracing.

   From the environment perspective the I2RS agent MUST be aware when
   the resource has been modified outside the I2RS plane by another
   plane (management, control, or forwarding).  The prioritization
   between the different planes should set a deterministic policy that
   allows the collision of two planes (I2RS plane and another plane) to
   be resolved via an overwrite policy in the I2RS agent.

   Similar requirements exist for knowledge about identities within the
   I2RS plane which modify things in the routing system, but this is
   within the scope of the I2RS protocol's requirements for ephemeral
   state [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state] and security requirements
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].

4.2.2.  I2RS Client Access Control Policies

   Overview:

   The I2RS client access control policies are responsible for
   authenticating the application managing the privileges for the
   applications, and enforcing access control to resources by the
   applications.

   Requirements:

   REQ 26: I2RS client should authenticate its applications.  If the
           I2RS client acts as a broker and supports multiple
           applications, it should authenticate each application.

   REQ 27: I2RS client should define access control policies associated
           to each applications.  An access to a routing resource by an
           application should not be forwarded immediately and
           transparently by the I2RS client based on the I2RS agent
           access control policies.  The I2RS client should first check

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


           whether the application has sufficient privileges, and if so
           send an access request to the I2RS agent.

   Explanation:

   If no authentication mechanisms have being provided between the I2RS
   client and the application, then I2RS client must be dedicated to a
   single application.  By doing so, application authentication relies
   on the I2RS authentication mechanisms between the I2RS client and the
   I2RS agent.

   If an I2RS client has multiple identities that are associated with
   different privileges for accessing an I2RS agent(s), the I2RS client
   access control policies should specify the I2RS client identity with
   the access control policy.

4.2.3.  Application and Access Control Policies

   Overview

   Applications do not enforce access control policies.  Instead these
   are enforced by the I2RS clients and the I2RS agents.  This section
   provides recommendations for applications in order to ease I2RS
   access control by the I2RS client and the I2RS agent.

   Requirements:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 28: applications SHOULD be uniquely identified by their
                   associated I2RS clients

   Explanation:

   Different application may use different methods (or multiple methods)
   to communicate with its associated I2RS client, and each application
   may not use the same form of an application identifier.  However, the
   I2RS client must obtain an identifier for each application.  One
   method for this identification can be a system user id.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 29: Each application SHOULD be associated to a restricted
                   number of I2RS client

   Explanation:

   The I2RS client provides access to resource on its behalf and this
   access should only be granted for trusted applications, or
   applications with an similar level of trust.  This does not prevent
   an I2RS client to host a large number of applications with the same
   levels of trust.

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   SEC-ENV-REQ 30: An application SHOULD be provided means and methods
                   to contact their associated I2RS client.

   Explanation:

   It is obvious when an I2RS client belongs to the application as part
   of a module or a library that the application can communicate with a
   I2RS client.  Similarly, if the application runs into a dedicated
   system with a I2RS client, it is obvious which I2RS client the
   application should contact.  If the application connects to the I2RS
   client remotely, the application needs some to be able to retrieve
   the necessary information to contact its associated I2RS client (e.g.
   an IP address or a FQDN).

5.  I2RS Application Isolation

   A key aspect of the I2RS architecture is the network oriented
   application.  As these application are supposed to be independent,
   controlled by independent and various tenants.  In addition to
   independent logic, these applications may be malicious.  Then, these
   applications introduce also programmability which results in fast
   network settings.

   The I2RS architecture should remain robust to these applications and
   make sure an application does not impact the other applications.
   This section discusses both security aspects related to
   programmability as well as application isolation in the I2RS
   architecture.

5.1.  Robustness Toward Programmability

   Overview

   I2RS provides a programmatic interface in and out of the Internet
   routing system which provides the following advantages for security

   o  the use of automation reduces configuration errors

   o  the programmatic interface enables fast network reconfiguration
      and agility in adapting to network attacks,

   o  monitoring facilities to detect and configuration to mitigate a
      network attack.

   Programmability allows applications to flexible control which may
   cause problems due to:





Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


   o  applications which belong to different tenants with different
      objectives,

   o  applications which lack coordination resulting in unstable routing
      configurations such as oscillations between network
      configurations, and creation of loops for example.  For example,
      one application may monitor a state and change to positive, and a
      second application performs the reverse operation (turns it
      negative).  This fluctuation can cause a routing system to become
      unstable.

   The I2RS plane requires data and application isolation to prevent
   such situations to happen.  However, to guarantee the network
   stability constant monitoring and error detection are recommended to
   be activated.

   Requirement:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 31: The I2RS agents should monitor constantly parts of
                   the system for which I2RS clients or applications
                   have provided requests.  It should also be able to
                   detect I2RS clients or applications that lead the
                   routing system in an unstable state.

   Explanation:

   Monitoring consists at least in logging events and eventually provide
   notifications or alerts to the management plane in case, something
   has been detected.  The management plane is in charge of collecting
   the logs, the notifications and eventually to consider the
   appropriated actions.  A typical action may be the update of I2RS
   access control policies for example or re-configuring routing
   elements.

5.2.  Application Isolation

5.2.1.  DoS

   Overview:

   Requirements for robustness to DoS attacks have been addressed in the
   communication channel section [RFC7921].  This section focuses on
   requirements for application isolation that help prevent DoS.

   Requirements:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 32: In order to prevent DoS, it is recommended the I2RS
                   agent controls the resources allocated to each I2RS



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 23]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


                   clients.  I2RS client that acts as broker may not be
                   protected as efficiently against these attacks unless
                   the broker performs resource controls for the hosted
                   applications.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 33: I2RS agent does not make response redirection
                   possible unless the redirection is previously
                   validated and agreed by the destination.

   SEC-ENV-REQ 34: avoid the use of underlying protocols that are not
                   robust to reflection attacks.

   Explanation:

   The I2RS interface is used by application to interact with the
   routing states.  As the I2RS agent is shared between multiple
   applications, one application can prevent an application by
   performing DoS or DDoS attacks on the I2RS agent or on the network.
   DoS attack targeting the I2RS agent would consist in providing
   requests that keep the I2RS agent busy for a long time.  These
   attacks on the I2RS agent may involve an application (requesting
   through an I2RS Client) heavy computation by the I2RS agent in order
   to block operations like disk access.

   Some DoS attacks may attack the I2RS Client's reception of
   notification and monitoring data stream over the network.  Other DoS
   attacks may focus on the application directly by performing
   reflection attacks.  Such an attack could be performed by first
   detecting an application is related to monitoring the RIB or changing
   the RIB.

   Reflection-based DoS may be performed at various levels utilizing UDP
   at the service to redirect data to a specific repository.

5.2.2.  Application Logic Control

   Overview

   Requirements for application control have been addressed in the I2RS
   plane isolation as well as in the trusted Communication Channel
   sections.  This section examines how application logic must be design
   to ensure application isolation.

   Requirements:

   SEC-ENV-REQ 35: application logic should remain opaque to external
                   listeners. application logic may be partly hidden by
                   encrypting the communication between the I2RS client



Migault, et al.           Expires May 19, 2017                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft   I2RS Environment Security Requirements    November 2016


                   and the I2RS agent.  Additional ways to obfuscate the
                   communications may involve sending random messages of
                   various sizes.  Such strategies have to be balanced
                   with network load.  Note that I2RS client broker are
                   more likely to hide the application logic compared to
                   I2RS client associated to a single application.

   Explanation:

   Applications use the I2RS interface in order to update the routing
   system.  These updates may be driven by behavior on the forwarding
   plane or any external behaviors.  In this case, correlating
   observation to the I2RS traffic may enable to derive the application
   logic.  Once the application logic has been derived, a malicious
   application may generate traffic or any event in the network in order
   to activate the alternate application.

6.  Security Considerations

   The whole document is about security requirements for the I2RS
   environment.  To protect personal privacy, any identifier (I2RS
   application identifier, I2RS client identifier, or I2RS agent
   identifier) should not contain personal identifiable information.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations for this requirements.
