1.  Introduction

   It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values have
   been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed in the wild
   while not being assigned by the IANA for such usage.  This has led to
   deployment problems for new technologies such as Large BGP
   Communities [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community].

   The squatting of values 30, 31 and 129 has been confirmed by the
   involved vendors.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has marked values 30, 31 and 129 as
   "deprecated" in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry under the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
