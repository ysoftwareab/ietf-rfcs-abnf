INTERNET-DRAFT         RADIUS Attributes for WLAN           13 June 2006


1.  Introduction

   In situations where it is desirable to centrally manage
   authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) for IEEE 802.11
   wireless LANs, deployment of a backend authentication and accounting
   server is desirable.  In such situations, it is expected that IEEE
   802.11 authenticators will function as AAA clients.  This document
   defines additional attributes suitable for usage by IEEE 802.11
   authenticators acting as AAA clients.  The attributes defined in this
   document are usable both within RADIUS and Diameter.

1.1.  Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

Access Point (AP)
          A Station that provides access to the distribution services
          via the wireless medium for associated Stations.

Association
          The service used to establish Access Point/Station mapping and
          enable Station invocation of the distribution system services.

authenticator
          An authenticator is an entity that require authentication from
          the supplicant.  The authenticator may be connected to the
          supplicant at the other end of a point-to-point LAN segment or
          802.11 wireless link.

authentication server
          An authentication server is an entity that provides an
          authentication service to an authenticator.  This service
          verifies from the credentials provided by the supplicant, the
          claim of identity made by the supplicant.

Station (STA)
          Any device that contains an IEEE 802.11 conformant medium
          access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the
          wireless medium (WM).

Supplicant
          A supplicant is an entity that is being authenticated by an
          authenticator.  The supplicant may be connected to the
          authenticator at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment or
          802.11 wireless link.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  RADIUS Attributes

2.1.  Allowed-SSID

   Description

      The Allowed-SSID attribute allows the RADIUS server to specify
      which SSIDs the user is allowed to access.  This may be useful in
      situations where the SSID is not yet known (such as in pre-
      authentication), or where subsequent handoff can occur without
      interaction with a AAA server.  One or more Allowed-SSID
      attributes MAY be included an Access-Accept or CoA-Request packet.
      This attribute is not allowed in other RADIUS packets.  A summary
      of the Allowed-SSID attribute format is shown below.  The fields
      are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Length       |            String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

      TBD

   Length

      >=3

   String

      The String field contains one or more octets, encoding a single
      SSID, as defined in [IEEE-802.11].  If the SSID included in the
      Allowed-SSID attribute is not supported by the NAS, the attribute
      is silently discarded.  UTF-8 encoded 10646 characters are
      recommended, but a robust implementation SHOULD support the field
      as undistinguished octets.

INTERNET-DRAFT         RADIUS Attributes for WLAN           13 June 2006


2.2.  SSID

   Description

      The SSID attribute allows the NAS to specify which SSID the user
      is attempting to access.  A single SSID attribute MAY be included
      in an Access-Request packet.  This attribute is not allowed in
      other RADIUS packets.  A summary of the SSID attribute is shown
      below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Length       |            String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

      TBD

   Length

      >=3

   String

      The String field contains one or more octets, encoding a single
      SSID, as defined in [IEEE-802.11].  UTF-8 encoded 10646 characters
      are recommended, but a robust implementation SHOULD support the
      field as undistinguished octets.

2.3.  Allowed-Called-Station-ID

   Description

      The Allowed-Called-Station-ID attribute allows the RADIUS server
      to specify which Called-Station-IDs the user is allowed to access.
      More than one Allowed-Called-Station-ID attribute MAY be included
      in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request packet.  This attribute is not
      allowed in other RADIUS packets.  A summary of the Allowed-Called-
      Station-ID attribute format is shown below.  The fields are
      transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Code

      TBD

   Length

      >=3

   String

      The String field is one or more octets, containing the layer 2
      endpoint that the user's call terminated on.  For details of the
      encoding, see [RFC2865] and [RFC3580].  Note that this attribute
      MUST NOT include the SSID.  If the Called-Station-ID included in
      the Allowed-Called-Station-ID attribute does not describe a layer
      2 endpoint of the NAS, the attribute is silently discarded.  A
      robust implementation SHOULD support the field as undistinguished
      octets.

2.4.  EAP-Key-Name

   Description

      The EAP-Key-Name attribute, defined in [RFC4072], contains the EAP
      Session-ID, as described in [KEYFRAME].  Exactly how this
      attribute is used depends on the link layer in question.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  An EAP-
      Key-Name attribute MAY only be included within Access-Request,
      Access-Accept and CoA-Request packets.  A summary of the EAP-Key-
      Name attribute format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted
      from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3

INTERNET-DRAFT         RADIUS Attributes for WLAN           13 June 2006


   String

      The String field, when present, is one or more octets, containing
      the EAP Session-ID, as defined in [KEYFRAME].  Since the NAS
      operates as a pass-through in EAP, it cannot know the EAP Session-
      ID before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a result, an
      EAP-Key-Name attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST NOT contain
      any data.  A RADIUS server receiving an Access-Request with an
      EAP-Key-Name attribute containing data MUST silently discard the
      attribute.  In addition, the RADIUS server SHOULD include this
      attribute in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request only if an EAP-Key-
      Name attribute was present in the Access-Request.

2.5.  EAP-Peer-Id

   Description

      The EAP-Peer-Id attribute contains an the Peer-Id generated by the
      EAP method.  Exactly how this name is used depends on the link
      layer in question.  See [KEYFRAME] for more discussion.  The EAP-
      Peer-Id attribute is only allowed in Access-Request and Access-
      Accept packets.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name, and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  Since the
      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP, it cannot know the EAP-
      Peer-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a result,
      an EAP-Peer-Id attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST NOT
      contain any data.  A home RADIUS server receiving an Access-
      Request an EAP-Peer-Id attribute with non-empty data MUST silently
      discard the attribute.  In addition, the home RADIUS server SHOULD
      include this attribute an Access-Accept only if an empty EAP-Peer-
      Id attribute was present in the Access-Request.  A summary of the
      EAP-Peer-Id attribute format is shown below.  The fields are
      transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3

   String

      The String field, when present, is one or more octets containing
      the EAP Peer-Id exported by the EAP method.  For details, see
      [KEYFRAME] Appendix A.  A robust implementation SHOULD support the
      field as undistinguished octets.

2.6.  EAP-Server-Id

   Description

      The EAP-Server-Id attribute contains the Server-Id generated by
      the EAP method.  Exactly how this name is used depends on the link
      layer in question.  See [KEYFRAME] for more discussion.  The EAP-
      Server-Id attribute is only allowed in Access-Request and Access-
      Accept packets.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name, and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  Since the
      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP, it cannot know the EAP-
      Server-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a
      result, an EAP-Server-Id attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST
      NOT contain any data.  A home RADIUS server receiving in an
      Access-Request an EAP-Server-Id attribute with non-empty data MUST
      silently discard the attribute.  In addition, the home RADIUS
      server SHOULD include this attribute an Access-Accept only if an
      empty EAP-Server-Id attribute was present in the Access-Request.
      A summary of the EAP-Server-Id attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

2.7.  Mobility-Domain-Id

   Description

      A single Mobility-Domain-Id attribute MAY be included in an
      Access-Request or Accounting-Request, in order to enable the NAS
      to provide the RADIUS server with the Mobility Domain Identifier,
      defined in [IEEE-802.11r].  A summary of the Mobility-Domain-Id
      attribute format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from
      left to right.

      encoded 10646 characters are recommended, but a robust
      implementation SHOULD support the field as undistinguished octets.

2.8.  Preauth-Timeout

   Description

      This attribute sets the maximum number of seconds which pre-
      authentication state is kept by the NAS.  This attribute is
      available to be sent by the server to the client in an Access-
      Accept.  It also MAY be sent by the client to the server in an
      Access-Request in order to indicate a preauthentication request
      and provide a hint.  Where both Session-Timeout and Preauth-
      Timeout attributes are present in an Access-Accept, the Session-

INTERNET-DRAFT         RADIUS Attributes for WLAN           13 June 2006


     0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   The EAP-Key-Name attribute is aready defined as a RADIUS attribute
   within Diameter EAP [RFC4072].

   When used in Diameter, the other attributes defined in this
   specification can be used as Diameter AVPs from the Code space 1-255
   (RADIUS attribute compatibility space).  No additional Diameter Code
   values are therefore allocated.  The data types and flag rules for
   the attributes are as follows:

                                  +---------------------+
                                  |    AVP Flag rules   |
                                  |----+-----+----+-----|----+
                                  |    |     |SHLD| MUST|    |
   Attribute Name      Value Type |MUST| MAY | NOT|  NOT|Encr|
   -------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|
   Allowed-SSID        OctetString| M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   SSID                OctetString| M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Allowed-Called-                |    |     |    |     |    |
   Station-Id          UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   EAP-Peer-Id         UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   EAP-Server-Id       UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Mobility-Domain-Id  OctetString|    | P,M |    |  V  | Y  |
   Preauth-Timeout     Unsigned32 | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   -------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|

   The attributes in this specification have no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways;
   they are copied as is, except for changes relating to headers,
   alignment, and padding. See also [RFC 3588] Section 4.1 and [RFC
   4005] Section 9.

   What this specification says about the applicability of the
   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to
   AA-Request [RFC 4005] or Diameter-EAP-Request [RFC 4072].  What is
   said about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer [RFC
   4005] or Diameter-EAP-Answer [RFC 4072] with Result-Code AVP set to
   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.

   What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success.  Similarly, what
   is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter to AA-
   Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.

   What is said about COA-Request applies in Diameter to Re-Auth-Request
   [RFC 4005].

   What is said about Accounting-Request applies to Diameter Accounting-
   Request [RFC 4005] as well.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requires assignment of a RADIUS attribute types
   for the following attributes:

   Attribute                     Type
   =========                     ====
   Allowed-SSID                  TBD
   SSID                          TBD
   Allowed-Called-Station-Id     TBD
   EAP-Peer-Id                   TBD
   EAP-Server-Id                 TBD
   Mobility-Domain-Id            TBD
   Preauth-Timeout               TBD

6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization, and accounting in WLANs, it is
   vulnerable to all of the threats that are present in other RADIUS
   applications.  For a discussion of these threats, see [RFC2607],
   [RFC2865], [RFC3162], [RFC3576], [RFC3579], and [RFC3580].
