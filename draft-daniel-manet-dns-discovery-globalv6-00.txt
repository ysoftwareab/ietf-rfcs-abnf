  Abstract 
   
     This document proposes the mechanism of DNS Discovery for      
     global connectivity based on modified manet Router Advertisement 
     message in IPv6 mobile ad hoc networks. 
      
      
  1. Introduction 
      
     The global connectivity in IPv6 mobile ad hoc networks is often 
     required for manet nodes desiring communication with the fixed 
     Internet [GLOBALv6].  For global connectivity, manet nodes have 
     unique global address which is used for communication to the 
     Internet.  This address is typically resolved from a DNS name.  DNS 
     resolution is a vital service for a host connected to an IPv6 
     network.

  INTERNET-DRAFT            DNS Discovery in MANET        March 29, 2004 
   
   
   
      
     This document describes the process of DNS Discovery based on      
     IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) to find out the address of DNS server 
     in IPv6 Mobile Ad hoc Networks and defines new manet DNS resolver 
     option in modified manet Router Advertisement [GLOBALv6].  The Manet 
     DNS reslover option will allow any manet nodes to discover IPv6 
     addresses of DNS resolvers (with preference to global-unicast 
     addresses).  The purpose is also to enhance the efficiency of global 
     connectivity [GLOBALv6] when internet-gateway does not provide proxy 
     DNS function. 
      
      
  1.1 Terminology 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL      
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 
     2119].  
            
          o DNS Discovery         The process of manet nodes to find out 
                                  the address of DNS server, typically 
                                  recursive DNS server addresses in the 
                                  Internet.  The addresses are used for 
                                  manet nodes to obtain global addresses 
                                  from a DNS name. 
            
          o Manet DNS resolver (MDNSR) option  
                                  The Manet DNS resolver option contains 
                                  the DNS server addresses in modified 
                                  manet Router Advertisement message. 
            
          o internet-gateway      A router which provides Internet 
                                  connectivity for nodes in the manet. 
                                  This router is located at the edge of 
                                  manet and has a connection to both the 
                                  Internet and the manet. (is described 
                                  in [GLOBALv6]. 
            
      
  2. Overview 
      
     Likewise generally IPv6 networks, an internet-gateway sends out a 
     manet Router Advertisement message either periodically or response 
     to a manet Router Solicitation.  Moreover, the internet-gateway 
     allows to send unsolicited manet Router Advertisements, although

     sending them periodically would generate unnecessary packets in 
     manet.  After manet nodes obtain global address, DNS queries, web 
     browsing and that kind of services can be used in manet.  The MDNSR 
     option provides a standard mechanism for advertising DNS resolver 
     IPv6 addresses with current manet Router Advertisement in manet. 
      
      
  3. MANET DNS Resolve Option 
      
     The MDNSR option contains the IPv6 address of DNS server. When 
     advertising more than one MDNSR option, as many MDNSR options as DNS 
     servers are included in a MANET Router Advertisement message.

     Fields:

        o Length    8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of option  
                    (including the type and length fields).  The value 0  
                    is invalid.  Nodes MUST silently discard a MANET 
                    Router Advertisement message that contains an option 
                    with length zero.  
      
        o Pref      The preference of a DNS server.  A 4 bit unsigned  
                    integer.  A decimal value of 15 indicates the highest 
                    preference.  A decimal value of 0 indicates that the 
                    DNS server can not be used.  The field can be used 
                    for load balancing of DNS queries with multiple 
                    recursive DNS servers according to local policy.

  4. Security Considerations 
      
     This security is essentially related to Neighbor Discovery Protocol 
     security [DISCOVERY] and the security section in [GLOBALv6].  
     Security issues regarding the Neighbor Discovery Protocol are being 
     discussed in SEND (Secure Neighbor Discovery) Working Group in IETF.
