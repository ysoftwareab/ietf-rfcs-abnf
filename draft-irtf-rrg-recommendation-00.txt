Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


1.  Introduction

   It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing
   architecture is facing challenges in scalability, multi-homing, and
   inter-domain traffic engineering.  The problem being addressed has
   been documented in [I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement], and the
   design goals that we have agreed to can be found in
   [I-D.irtf-rrg-design-goals].  This document is the Routing Research
   Group's (RRG's) preliminary recommendation for a new routing
   architecture.

   This document is a work in progress.

1.1.  Structure of This Document

   This document describes many of the different possible approaches
   that could be taken in a new routing architecture, as well as a
   summary of the current thinking of the overall group regarding each
   approach.


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   This section describes the common terminology used in this document.
   Particular architectures and discussions frequently define additional
   terms, qualify these terms or add additional semantics.

   FIB  Forwarding Information Base, also known as the forwarding table.
      Typically, the forwarding table contains the subset of the
      information in the RIB that is actually needed at forwarding time.

   GUID  Globally Unique IDentifier

   ISP  Internet Service Provider

   identifier  An identifier is the name of an endpoint.  It has no
      topological significance.  Identifiers may have other properties,
      such as the scope of their uniqueness (global or local) and the
      probability of their uniqueness (absolute or statistical).

   locator  A locator is a name that has topological significance.

   RIB  Routing Information Base, also known as the routing table.

   RIR  Regional Internet Registry

Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


   RLOC  A Remote LOCator is a locator with global scope.

   SID  Session IDentifier

   TE Traffic Engineering is a technique for controlling the path that
      traffic takes beyond baseline methods.


3.  Taxonomies of the Solution Space

   In trying to understand the entirety of the solution space that we
   are confronted with, we have made multiple attempts to divide the
   space into comprehensible sectors.  The entire solution space is
   complex, and it seems difficult to capture all of the pertinent
   dimensions of the space with only a single perspective.  Different
   taxonomies seem to provide insight during different discussions, and
   we summarize all of them here to capture all of the useful
   perspectives.

3.1.  A Mechanism Taxonomy

   In this taxonomy, solutions are grouped by the primary mechanisms
   that they use to achieve their goals.

3.1.1.  Transport

   Transport solutions are characterized by their usage of modifications
   soley at the transport layer to provide locator and identifier
   independence.  For example, if a transport protocol supports
   connections across multiple addresses as a means of supporting multi-
   homed hosts, and can seamlessly and transparently shift across these
   addresses, then it can provide the multi-homing support that is
   required.

   However, in our discussions, it became clear that even with transport
   level agility, host-level renumbering of sites would still be
   necessary to support these types of solutions.  The consensus of the
   group is that such site renumbering is a completely unacceptable
   requirement and as such, these types of solutions are not of interest
   for further exploration.

3.1.2.  Translation

   Translation solutions are characterized by a translation operation
   between an identifier to a locator and back to an identifier as the
   packet traverses the network.  Translation approaches do not add
   additional encapsulations to the packet as they traverse the network,
   usually translating the fields in their place in the packet.

Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


   Translation solutions can further be categorized as those with
   separated fields for locators and identifiers and those that continue
   to use a single address field.  Translation solutions also can be
   categorized as having the translation done in the host or in a middle
   box.

3.1.3.  Map & Encap

   Map & Encap solutions are characterized by a lookup operation from
   the identifier to a locator and then an encapsulation of the packet
   payload into a tunnel that directs the packet across the topology.

3.2.  A Functional Taxonomy

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Lixia to propose text here.

3.2.1.  Separation

3.2.2.  Elimination

3.3.  The Herrin Taxonomy

   As part of the mailing list discussion, the group constructed a more
   detailed taxonomy of possible architectures, described as a series of
   strategies.

3.3.1.  Strategy A

   Local routing is based on an address, which functions as a GUID, SID
   component and local locator, but have each packet flow through an
   encoder which attaches a RLOC before the packet enters the
   internetwork core.  Routing within the core is based on the RLOC.
   Only ISPs with significant interconnection have their own RLOCs.
   Fewer than 10,000 such "core ISPs" exist today and the number is
   growing much more slowly than the routing table overall.  Once the
   packet reaches the network identified by the RLOC, local routing by
   address takes over for final delivery.  Distribute RLOCs through the
   core via a typical distance-vector or link-state routing protocol.

3.3.1.1.  Variants

   A1a  Each core ISP has one RLOC.  The RLOC's existence and
      reachability is flooded to the rest of the core.

   A1b  Each core ISP has a small number of RLOCs for TE.  The RLOCs'
      existence and reachability is flooded to the rest of the core.

Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


   A1c  Each core ISP has an aggregated set of RLOCs which it may
      hierarchically assign to customers downstream and/or disaggregate
      for TE.  The aggregated RLOC's existence and reachability is
      flooded to the rest of the core.

3.3.1.2.  Mapping approaches

   A2a  Addresses are statically mapped to RLOCs.  Map entries are
      periodically pushed towards a central or distributed registry.
      The full list is periodically downloaded to the encoders which add
      RLOCs to the packets.

   A2b  Addresses are dynamically mapped to RLOCs.  Map entries are
      pushed towards a central or distributed registry as they change.
      The registry pushes all incremental changes in near-real time to
      all encoders which add RLOCs to the packets.

   A2c  Addresses are dynamically mapped to RLOCs.  Map entries are
      pushed towards a central or distributed registry as they change.
      Encoders request and briefly cache individual mappings from the
      registry as needed.

3.3.1.3.  Failure handling approaches

   Link failures in the Internet core cause the RLOCs to be rerouted
   with no change to the address to RLOC mapping.

   A3a  RLOC encoders detect when particular RLOCs are no longer
      reachable at all and fall back on secondary RLOCs for a particular
      address.  Encoders rely on active failure messages from some
      system in the RLOC-specified network to indicate that a host is no
      longer available via that RLOC, causing them to fall back on
      secondary RLOCs for that host.

   A3b  Link failures which prevent parts of the RLOC's network from
      reaching a destination host or set of hosts it serves cause an
      external analysis element to make a dynamic change to the address-
      RLOC map, depreferencing or removing the affected RLOC.  The
      external analysis element may be under the control of the end-user
      destination network, the RLOC network or a third party under
      contract to one of them.

3.3.1.4.  Compatibility approaches

   A4a  Create a new IP protocol.  The new protocol would not be
      compatible with IPv4 and IPv6.

   A4b  Modify the IP protocol.  The modified protocol would not be
      compatible with IPv4 and IPv6 as deployed.

   A4c  Standard IPv4 and IPv6 packets are tunnelled while they transit
      the Internet core.  Path-MTU issues are handled by setting an
      Internet-wide maximum packet size enforced by the encoders and
      assuring that all core links support that size.

   A4d  Standard IPv4 and IPv6 packets are tunnelled while they transit
      the Internet core.  Path-MTU issues are handled by returning
      packets which breach the MTU while in the core back to the encoder
      who must act as a proxy by returning a sensible packet-too-big
      message to the originating host.

   A4e  The IPv6 address space is partitioned into end-user address
      space and Internet core address space.  The address to RLOC map is
      symmetric.  Part of the IPv6 end-user address is swapped for the
      RLOC when the packet enters the Internet core and then restored
      when it leaves the Internet core.  Use a different A4 variant for
      IPv4.

   A4f  The IPv6 flow label or some other component(s) of the IPv6
      header are used to contain the RLOC.  The flow label is set before
      the packet enters the core.  Non-local packets are routed based on
      the flow label.  Use a different A4 variant for IPv4.

   A4g  Steal bits from other functions in the IPv4 header (e.g.
      checksum) to make space for an RLOC.  Discard those components and
      set the RLOC when the packet enters the core.  Restore the
      original bits when the packet leaves the core.  Use a different A4
      variant for IPv6.

3.3.1.5.  Core routing methods

   A5a  Distribute RLOCs through the Internet core via BGP.

   A5b  Distribute RLOCs through the Internet core via a new distance-
      vector protocol.

   A5c  Distribute RLOCs through the Internet core via a link-state
      protocol.

Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


3.3.1.6.  Major criticisms

   There don't appear to be any genuinely clean ways of implementing
   strategy A. Handling path-MTU is a usually problem since the packets
   in the core are different than the origin host would recognize.
   Extra bandwidth is consumed by the ingress tunnel router figuring out
   whether the egress tunnel router is still available and functioning.
   Border filtering of source addresses becomes problematic.

   Deployment may require heavy weight "for the public good" relays in
   the non-upgraded part of the Internet to facilitate migration.

   During the transition period, it appears difficult to remove legacy
   prefixes from the global routing table.  The best that can be done is
   to advertise aggregates of legacy prefixes from the relays.  This may
   have an impact on stretch.

3.3.2.  Strategy B

   Assign hierarchically aggregatable locators to every host.  Assign
   multiple locators to each host such that in the network topology
   hosts appear as stubs in multiple locations instead of forming
   distant connections in the graph.  Assign one aggregated set of
   locators to each core ISP where a core ISP is one which has at least
   half a dozen major transit or peering links.  Flood the aggregated
   locator's existence and reachability to the rest of the core.

   Having reduced the network topology to something relatively close to
   a hierarchy, perform plain old hierarchical aggregation on the
   locators.  Add and remove locators to each host dynamically during
   operation as needed to reflect changes in the nearby network
   hierarchies.

   Attach source and destination locators when the packet leaves the
   host.  Route by first source then destination locator: move up the
   source network hierarchy until you can move laterally toward the
   destination locator in a permissioned manner.

   Identifier to locator maps are pushed from the host towards a
   distributed registry as they change.  Hosts request and temporarily
   cache individual mappings from the registry as needed.

3.3.2.1.  Locator variants

   B1a  A hierarchically aggregated numeric locator is dynamically
      assigned to each host from each upstream path.  Each router
      receives a less specific prefix from upstream and assigns a more
      specific prefix downstream.  Link state changes in the path to the
      core are satisfied by renumbering instead of rerouting: the host
      abandons the locator hierarchically associated with the old path.
      If a new path is available, the host acquires a locator
      hierarchically associated with the new path.

   B1b  A locator is an administratively-assigned loose source route
      instead of a single address.  The first address in the loose
      source route is a universally-known waypoint router.  The last
      address is the final destination.  Link state changes in the path
      to the core are satisfied by rerouting in the appropriate routing
      domain when possible.  If rerouting in the affected domain is not
      possible, the host abandons the impacted locator.

   B1c  Semi-hierarchical numeric locators are administratively
      assigned.  Local reconnection during link state changes is
      accomplished with rerouting instead of renumbering.

3.3.2.2.  Identifier variants

   B2a  Each host has a single numeric identifer to which the locators
      are attached.  This identifier is used by the layer-4/5 and higher
      protocols to compose the SID.

   B2b  Each service provided by a host has a globally unique,
      hierarchical character-string identifier to which the locators are
      attached.  Clients initiating communication with that service
      negotiate a numeric SID which is unique only within the scope of
      that service.

3.3.2.3.  Major criticisms

   1.  This strategy is probably not compatible with UDP or TCP though
       B1a/c could be compatible with IPv6's layer 3.  The replacement
       layer-4/5 protocols should also be coaxable to run on top of
       IPv4's layer 3 in the not-yet-upgraded part of the network.

   2.  How do firewalls work if the locators are constantly in flux in
       B1a?

   3.  How is theft of service avoided in B1b?

Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


3.3.3.  Strategy C

   Suppress distant routes by aggregating them into sets expected to be
   available in a given direction.  Because locator reachability info is
   not flooded, the routing tables each router must deal with are
   relatively small.

3.3.3.1.  Variants

   C1 Aggregate locators based on geography.  All nodes within some
      geographic boundary are assigned the same locator.  Routers move
      packets to any adjacent router deemed to be "closer" to the
      locator in question.

3.3.3.2.  Major criticisms

   No one has been able to construct a proposal under strategy C without
   introducing constraints that are fundamentally incompatible with the
   Internet's economic model.  For example, geographic aggregation has
   been shown to have uncorrectable theft-of-service anomalies in
   networks as small as 8 autonomous systems and two geographic areas.

   Fundamentally, geographic aggregation requires that there be a per-
   region interconnect that functions as the deaggregation point for the
   region's traffic.  Funding such an interconnect and compelling the
   affected ISPs to participate in the interconnect requires external
   third party coercive controls.

3.3.4.  Strategy D

   Use plain old BGP for the RIB.  Algorithmically compress the FIB in
   each router.

3.3.4.1.  Variants

   D1a  Aggregate any adjacent routes that have the same next hop.

   D1b  Insert a /0 route into the FIB which goes to the most popular
      next hop for all the routes in the RIB.  Step to the /1 level.
      For each /1, if most of the routes in the RIB within that /1 go to
      a different next hop than the longest route above (the /0 route),
      add that /1 route to the FIB.  Step to the /2 level.  Repeat until
      all routes in the RIB go to the correct next hop in the FIB.
      Unrouted space is treated as "don't care": it will route wherever
      the algorithm happens to drop it and will rely on the TTL to take
      packets off the network.

3.3.4.2.  Major criticisms

   1.  The RIB can grow to up to an order of magnitude larger than the
       FIB before it hits the wall too.  One order of magnitude doesn't
       gain us multihoming for small office/home office sites.

   2.  FIBs towards the edge should aggregate well with this strategy
       but there's no evidence to support a conclusion that they'd
       aggregate well deep in the core.

3.3.5.  Strategy E

   Make no routing architecture changes.  Instead, create a billing
   system through which the ISPs running core routers are paid by the
   ISPs announcing prefixes.  Let economics suppress growth to a
   survivable level.

3.3.5.1.  Variants

   E1a  Everybody pays the RIRs. the RIRs pay the router operators.

   E1b  Private negotiation between parties.

   E1c  Assisted private negotiation where router operators can offer
      standardized contracts to carry prefixes and prefix announcers can
      accept groups of identical contracts via an automated third-party
      payment system moving funds between the two easily.

3.3.5.2.  Major criticisms

   1.  If it could be done without creating massive boondoggle, why
       hasn't it been done already?  This has been discussed previously
       and there are no obvious mechanisms to put such a system in place
       without having a central authority for the Internet.

   2.  This means giving up on a solution that genuinely enables users
       and accepting one that merely keeps the Internet viable.

3.3.6.  Strategy F

   Do nothing.  (See [RFC1887] Section 4.4.1)

3.3.6.1.  Major criticisms

   It costs "everybody else" a grand total of at least $6000 per year
   for each prefix you announce.  [BGPCost] When we give away that $6000
   of value for free, it inevitably creates a "tragedy of the commons"
   problem.

Internet-Draft             RRG Recommendation              February 2009


   Given that the research group is chartered to 'do something', this
   alternative does not fit within the charter.

3.3.7.  Strategy G

   Change the topology so that all hosts attach to only one ISP using
   IPv6 and the ISP's single set of provider assigned addresses.
   (Actual result of [RFC1887] Section 4.4.3)

3.3.7.1.  Major criticisms

   This strategy wasn't accepted by the operations community because the
   IPv6 architecture makes renumbering every bit as hard as in IPv4 and
   the multihoming described in [RFC1887] Section 4.4.3 does not appear
   to actually work.


4.  Recommendations

4.1.  No manual renumbering of end hosts

   There is clear consensus in the group that renumbering of sites must
   not require manual intervention on a per-host basis.  This does not
   scale adequately from a management cost structure.  This effectively
   eliminates solutions that require that hosts have only a single
   locator and renumber on topological changes, or if hosts maintain
   multiple locators manually.

   This implies that transport solutions (Section 3.1.1) are
   unacceptable unless coupled with another mechanism that would
   automate the distribution and management of host renumbering, which
   appears to be a major undertaking all on its own.  Further, variants
   of Strategy B (Section 3.3.2) that require manual locator assignment
   are similarly unacceptable, as are solutions that do not
   significantly change existing host behavior, such as Strategy D
   (Section 3.3.4), Strategy E (Section 3.3.5), Strategy F
   (Section 3.3.6), and Strategy G (Section 3.3.7).

4.2.  Future progress

   The RRG should continue to prune the solution space presented here,
   attempting to find the overall maximally acceptable solution within
   the bounds and constraints that have been presented.  Whenever
   possible the research group will continue to discuss architectural
   concepts and make architectural recommendations rather than becoming
   embroiled in detailed engineering implementation discussions.

   The RRG should present a final recommendation by March, 2010.

5.  Acknowledgements

   This document represents a small portion of the overall work product
   of the Routing Research Group, who have developed all of these
   architectural approaches and many specific proposals within this
   solution space.

   In particular, Bill Herrin has been instrumental in constructing his
   taxonomy (Section 3.3), with the input of the entire community.  This
   has been pivotal in helping to focus the discussions of the group.
   We would also like to thank Joel Halpern for his insights and
   comments.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no requests to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   All solutions are required to provide security that is at least as
   strong as the existing Internet routing and addressing architecture.
