1. Abstract

   This document provides proposed definitions for several supplemental
   packages for Megaco/H.248. These packages address support of
   functionality for basic and enhanced telephony services.  This
   document is the updated version of the tones packages presented
   originally in draft-brown-megaco-supplpkgs-00.txt.


2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].


3. Packages and Megaco

   The packages defined in this draft are designed as discussed in
   Section 12 of RFC 3015 [3].  Packages allow finite and expandable
   extensions of the Megaco/H.248 protocol, allowing adaptation to a

   wide range of applications, without requiring change to the
   definition of the protocol itself.  The packages defined here allow
   a wide range of telephony services to be realized by the
   Megaco/H.248 protocol.


4. Basic Call Progress Tones Generator with Directionality Package

   PackageID: bcg (0x0023)
   Version: 1
   Extends: tonegen version 1

   This package defines the basic call progress tones as signals, with
   the ability to specify in which direction the tone is played with
   respect to the context.

   4.1 Properties

       None.

   4.2 Events

       None.

   4.3 Signals

       Dial Tone

          SignalID: bdt (0x0040)

          Generate dial tone. The physical characteristic of dial tone
          is available in the gateway.

          Signal Type: Timeout
          Duration: Provisioned, Not Auditable
          Additional Parameters:

             Tone Direction

                ParameterID: btd (0x01)
                Type: Enumeration
                Possible Values: External   ext  (0x01),
                                 Internal   int  (0x02),
                                 Both       both (0x03)

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the
                context. "Internal" denotes that the signal shall
                proceed toward the center of the context from the
                termination, while "external" denotes that the signal
                shall proceed toward the edge of the context.  "Both"
                indicates that the signal shall proceed in both
                directions. Unspecified tone direction shall default to

                "external". Note that using the playtone signal in
                package tonegen to generate these signals will prevent
                the capability to use the directionality parameter.

          Additional Values:
                bdt (0x0040) is defined as a tone id for playtone.

       The other tones of this package are defined in exactly the same
       way. A table with all signal names and signal Ids is included.
       Note that each tone is defined solely as a signal, and therefore
       does not extend the basic tone generation package.

       Comfort Tone

          SignalID: cmft (0x004a)

          Generate comfort tone, also known as routing tone, to
          indicate that the call is still in the process of being
          connected. Comfort tone corresponds to "comfort tone" as
          defined in ITU-T E.182. The physical characteristic of
          comfort tone is available in the gateway.

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the

                proceed toward the center of the context from the
                termination, while "external" denotes that the signal
                shall proceed toward the edge of the context.  "Both"
                indicates that the signal shall proceed in both
                directions. Unspecified tone direction shall default to
                "external". Note that using the playtone signal in
                package tonegen to generate this signal will prevent
                the capability to use the directionality parameter.

       Off-Hook Warning Tone

          SignalID: roh (0x004b)

          Generate receiver off-hook warning tone, to urge the customer

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the
                context. "Internal" denotes that the signal shall
                proceed toward the center of the context from the
                termination, while "external" denotes that the signal
                shall proceed toward the edge of the context.  "Both"

          Signal negative acknowledgement, indicating that the action
          was unsuccessful. Nack tone corresponds to "negative
          indication tone" as defined in ITU-T E.182. Typically, in
          North America, nack tone is mapped to "reorder tone" as
