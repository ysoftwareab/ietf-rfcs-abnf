Domain Name Associations (DNA) in the Extensible Messaging and Presence
                            Protocol (XMPP)
                         draft-ietf-xmpp-dna-09

Abstract

   This document improves the security of the Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol (XMPP) in two ways.  First, it specifies how to
   establish a strong association between a domain name and an XML
   stream, using the concept of "prooftypes".  Second, it describes how
   to securely delegate a service domain name (e.g., example.com) to a
   target server host name (e.g., hosting.example.net), which is
   especially important in multi-tenanted environments where the same
   target server hosts a large number of domains.

1.  Introduction

   In systems that use the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   (XMPP) [RFC6120], it is important to establish a strong association
   between the DNS domain name of an XMPP service (e.g., example.com)
   and the XML stream that a client or peer server initiates with that
   service.  In other words, the client or peer server needs to verify
   the identity of the server to which it connects.  Additionally,
   servers need to verify incoming connections from other servers.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   To date, such verification has been established based on information
   obtained from the Domain Name System (DNS), the Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI), or similar sources.  In relation to such
   associations, this document does the following:

   1.  Generalizes the model currently in use so that additional
       prooftypes can be defined if needed.

   2.  Provides a basis for modernizing some prooftypes to reflect
       progress in underlying technologies such as DNS Security
       [RFC4033].

   3.  Describes the flow of operations for establishing a domain name
       association (DNA).

   This document also provides guidelines for secure delegation of a
   service domain name (e.g., example.com) to a target server host name
   (e.g., hosting.example.net).  The need for secure delegation arises
   because the process for resolving the domain name of an XMPP service
   into the IP address at which an XML stream will be negotiated (see
   [RFC6120]) can involve delegation of a service domain name to a
   target server host name using technologies such as DNS SRV records
   [RFC2782].  A more detailed description of the delegation problem can
   be found in [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh].  If such delegation is not done in
   a secure manner, then the domain name association cannot be verified.

2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP terminology from [RFC6120] and
   [XEP-0220], DNS terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC2782] and
   [RFC4033], and security terminology from [RFC4949] and [RFC5280].
   The terms "reference identity", and "presented identity" are used as
   defined in the "CertID" specification [RFC6125].  For the sake of
   consistency with [I-D.ietf-dane-srv], this document uses the terms
   "service domain name" and "target server host name" to refer to the
   same entities identified by the terms "source domain" and "derived
   domain" from [RFC6125].

3.  Client-to-Server (C2S) DNA

   The client-to-server case is much simpler than the server-to-server
   case because the client does not assert a domain name, which means
   verification happens in only one direction.  Therefore we describe
   this case first to help the reader understand domain name
   associations in XMPP.

3.1.  C2S Flow

   The following flow chart illustrates the protocol flow for
   establishing a domain name association for an XML stream from a
   client (C) to a server (S) using the standard PKIX prooftype
   specified in [RFC6120].

              establishes DNA for a.example)
                           |

3.2.  C2S Description

   The simplified order of events (see [RFC6120] for details) in
   establishing an XML stream from a client (user@a.exmaple) to a server
   (a.example) is as follows:

   1.  The client resolves via DNS the service _xmpp-
       client._tcp.a.example.

   2.  The client opens a TCP connection to the resolved IP address.

   3.  The client sends an initial stream header to the server:

       <stream:stream from='user@a.example' to='a.example'>

   4.  The server sends a response stream header to the client,
       asserting that it is a.example:

       <stream:stream from='a.example' to='user@a.example'>

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   5.  The parties attempt TLS negotiation, during which the XMPP server
       (acting as a TLS server) presents a PKIX certificate proving that
       it is a.example.

   6.  The client checks the PKIX certificate that the server provided;
       if the proof is consistent with the XMPP profile of the matching
       rules from [RFC6125] and the certificate is otherwise valid
       according to [RFC5280], the client accepts that there is a strong
       domain name association between its stream to the target server
       and the DNS domain name of the XMPP service.

   The certificate that the server presents might not be trusted by the
   client.  As one example, the server might be hosting multiple domains
   and secure delegation as described in Section 6 is necessary.  As
   another example, the server might present a self-signed certificate,
   which requires the client to apply either the fallback process
   described in section 6.6.4 of [RFC6125] or prompt the user to accept
   an unauthenticated connection as described in [I-D.ietf-uta-xmpp].

4.  Server-to-Server (S2S) DNA

   The server-to-server case is significantly more complex than the
   client-to-server case, and involves checking of domain name
   associations in both directions along with other "wrinkles" described
   in the following sections.

4.1.  S2S Flow

   The following flow chart illustrates the protocol flow for
   establishing domain name associations between Server A (the
   initiating entity) and Server B (the receiving entity), as described
   in the remaining sections of this document.

4.2.  A Simple S2S Scenario

   To illustrate the problem, consider the simplified order of events
   (see [RFC6120] for details) in establishing an XML stream between
   Server A (a.example) and Server B (b.example):

   1.  Server A resolves via DNS the service _xmpp-
       server._tcp.b.example.

   2.  Server A opens a TCP connection to the resolved IP address.

   3.  Server A sends an initial stream header to Server B, asserting
       that it is a.example:

       <stream:stream from='a.example' to='b.example'>

   4.  Server B sends a response stream header to Server A, asserting
       that it is b.example:




Saint-Andre, et al.      Expires August 20, 2015                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


       <stream:stream from='b.example' to='a.example'>

   5.  The servers attempt TLS negotiation, during which Server B
       (acting as a TLS server) presents a PKIX certificate proving that
       it is b.example and Server A (acting as a TLS client) presents a
       PKIX certificate proving that it is a.example.

   6.  Server A checks the PKIX certificate that Server B provided and
       Server B checks the PKIX certificate that Server A provided; if
       these proofs are consistent with the XMPP profile of the matching
       rules from [RFC6125] and is otherwise valid according to
       [RFC5280], each server accepts that there is a strong domain name
       association between its stream to the other party and the DNS
       domain name of the other party.

   Several simplifying assumptions underlie the happy scenario just
   outlined:

   o  The PKIX certificate presented by Server B during TLS negotiation
      is trusted by Server A and matches the expected identity.

   o  The PKIX certificate presented by Server A during TLS negotiation
      is trusted by Server B, which enables the parties to complete
      mutual authentication.

   o  There are no additional domains associated with Server A and
      Server B (say, a subdomain rooms.a.example on Server A or a second
      domain c.example on Server B).

   o  The server administrators are able to obtain PKIX certificates
      issued by a widely-accepted certificate authority (CA) in the
      first place.

   o  The server administrators are running their own XMPP servers,
      rather than using hosting services.

   Let's consider each of these "wrinkles" in turn.  Since Server A is
   acting as a S2S client the behaviour is same as in the C2S case
   described in Section 3.2.

4.3.  One-Way Authentication

   If the PKIX certificate presented by Server A during TLS negotiation
   is not trusted by Server B, Server B is unable to mutually
   authenticate Server A. Therefore, Server B needs to verify the
   asserted identity of Server A by other means.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   1.  Server A asserts it is a.example using the Server Dialback
       protocol:

       <db:result from='a.example' to='b.example' id='...'>some-
       dialback-key</db:result>

   2.  Server B resolves via DNS the service _xmpp-
       server._tcp.a.example.

   3.  Server B opens a TCP connection to the resolved IP address.

   4.  Server B sends an initial stream header to Server A, asserting
       that it is b.example:

       <stream:stream from='b.example' to='a.example'>

   5.  Server A sends a response stream header to Server B, asserting
       that it is a.example:

       <stream:stream from='a.example' to='b.example'>

   6.  The servers attempt TLS negotiation, during which Server A
       (acting as a TLS server) presents a PKIX certificate proving that
       it is a.example.

   7.  Server B checks the PKIX certificate that Server A provided.
       This might be the same certificate presented by Server A as a
       client certificate in the initial connection.  Even if this
       certificate is not signed by a trusted CA (for example it could
       be self-signed) Server B can verify that there is an association
       between the incoming connection and the domain name a.example.
       Note that this may be insecure unless DNSSEC [RFC4033] is used.

   8.  If the certificate provided by Server A is different from the one
       presented in the initial connection, Server B proceeds with
       Server Dialback in order to establish the domain name
       association.  In order to do this it sends a request for
       verification as described in [XEP-0220]:

       <db:verify from='b.example' to='a.example' id='...'>some-
       dialback-key</db:verify>

   9.  Server A responds to this:

       <db:verify from='a.example' to='b.example' id='...' type='valid/>

       allowing Server B to establish the domain name association.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   At this point the servers are using two TCP connections instead of
   one, which is somewhat wasteful.  However, there are ways to tie the
   authentication achieved on the second TCP connection to the first TCP
   connection; see [XEP-0288] for further discussion.

4.4.  Piggybacking

4.4.1.  Assertion

   Consider the common scenario in which Server B hosts not only
   b.example but also a second domain c.example (often called a "multi-
   tenanted" environment).  If a user of Server B associated with
   c.example wishes to communicate with a friend at a.example, Server B
   needs to send XMPP stanzas from the domain c.example rather than
   b.example.  Although Server B could open a new TCP connection and
   negotiate new XML streams for the domain pair of c.example and
   a.example, that too is wasteful (especially if Server B hosts a large
   number of domains).  Server B already has a connection to a.example,
   so how can it assert that it would like to add a new domain pair to
   the existing connection?

   The traditional method for doing so is the Server Dialback protocol,
   first specified in (the now obsolete) [RFC3920] and since moved to
   [XEP-0220].  Here, Server B can send a <db:result/> element for the
   new domain pair over the existing stream.

       <db:result from='c.example' to='a.example'>
         some-dialback-key
       </db:result>

   This element functions as Server B's assertion that it is (also)
   c.example, and thus is functionally equivalent to the 'from' address
   of an initial stream header as previously described.

   In response to this assertion, Server A needs to obtain some kind of
   proof that Server B really is also c.example.  If the certificate
   presented by Server B is also valid for c.example then no further
   action is necessary.  However, if not then Server A needs to do a bit
   more work.  Specifically, Server A can pursue the same strategy it
   used before:

   1.  Server A resolves via DNS the service _xmpp-
       server._tcp.c.example.

   2.  Server A opens a TCP connection to the resolved IP address (which
       might be the same IP address as for b.example).

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   3.  Server A sends an initial stream header to Server B, asserting
       that it is a.example:

       <stream:stream from='a.example' to='c.example'>

   4.  Server B sends a response stream header to Server A, asserting
       that it is c.example:

       <stream:stream from='c.example' to='a.example'>

   5.  The servers attempt TLS negotiation, during which Server B
       (acting as a TLS server) presents a PKIX certificate proving that
       it is c.example.

   6.  At this point, Server A needs to establish that, despite
       different certificates, c.example is associated with the origin
       of the request.  This is done using Server Dialback [XEP-0220]:

       <db:verify from='a.example' to='c.example' id='...'>some-
       dialback-key</db:verify>

   7.  Server B responds to this:

       <db:verify from='c.example' to='a.example' id='...' type='valid/>

       allowing Server A to establish the domain name association.

   Now that Server A accepts the domain name association, it informs
   Server B of that fact:

       <db:result from='a.example' to='c.example' type='valid'/>

   The parties can then terminate the second connection, since it was
   used only for Server A to associate a stream with the domain name
   c.example (the dialback key links the original stream to the new
   association).

4.4.2.  Supposition

   Piggybacking can also occur in the other direction.  Consider the
   common scenario in which Server A provides XMPP services not only for
   a.example but also for a subdomain such as a groupchat service (e.g.,
   Multi-User Chat [XEP-0045]) at rooms.a.example.  If a user from
   c.example at Server B wishes to join a room on the groupchat sevice,
   Server B needs to send XMPP stanzas from the domain c.example to the
   domain rooms.a.example rather than a.example.  First, Server B needs
   to determine whether it can piggyback the domain rooms.a.example on
   the connection to a.example:



Saint-Andre, et al.      Expires August 20, 2015               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   1.  Server B resolves vua DNS the service _xmpp-
       server._tcp.rooms.a.example.

   2.  Server B determines this resolves to an IP address and port that
       it is already connected to.

   3.  Server B determines that the PKIX certificate for that active
       connection would also be valid for the rooms.a.example domain and
       that Server A has announced support for dialback errors.

   Server B sends a dialback key to Server A over the existing
   connection.

       <db:result from='c.example' to='rooms.a.example'>
         some-dialback-key
       </db:result>

   Server A then informs Server B that it accepts the domain name
   association:

       <db:result from='rooms.a.example' to='c.example' type='valid'/>

5.  Alternative Prooftypes

   The foregoing protocol flows assumed that domain name associations
   were proved using the PKI prooftype specified in [RFC6120]: that is,
   the server's proof consists of a PKIX certificate that is checked
   according to the XMPP profile [RFC6120] of the matching rules from
   [RFC6125] (and the overall validation rules from [RFC5280]), the
   client's verification material is obtained out of band in the form of
   a trusted root, and secure DNS is not necessary.

   However, sometimes XMPP server administrators are unable or unwilling
   to obtain valid PKIX certificates for all of the domains they host at
   their servers.  For example:

   o  In order to issue a PKIX certificate, a CA might try to send email
      messages to authoritative mailbox names [RFC2142], but the
      administrator of a subsidiary service such as im.cs.podunk.example
      cannot receive email sent to mailto:hostmaster@podunk.example.

   o  A hosting provider such as hosting.example.net might not want to
      take on the liability of holding the certificate and private key
      for a tenant such as example.com (or the tenant might not want the
      hosting provider to hold its certificate and private key).

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   o  Even if PKIX certificates for each tenant can be obtained, the
      management of so many certificates can introduce a large
      administrative load.

   (Additional discussion can be found in [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh].)

   In these circumstances, prooftypes other than PKIX are desirable or
   necessary.  As described below, two alternatives have been defined so
   far: DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) and PKIX Over
   Secure HTTP (POSH).

5.1.  DANE

   The DANE prooftype can be defined as follows:

   1.  The server's proof consists of either a service certificate or
       domain-issued certificate (TLSA usage PKIX-EE or DANE-EE, see
       [RFC6698] and [RFC7218]).

   2.  The proof is checked by verifying an exact match or a hash of
       either the SubjectPublicKeyInfo or the full certificate.

   3.  The client's verification material is obtained via secure DNS as
       described in [I-D.ietf-dane-srv].

   4.  Secure DNS is necessary in order to effectively establish an
       alternative chain of trust from the service certificate or
       domain-issued certificate to the DNS root.

   The DANE prooftype makes use of the DNS-Based Authentication of Named
   Entities [RFC6698], specifically the use of DANE with DNS SRV records
   [I-D.ietf-dane-srv].  For XMPP purposes, the following rules apply:

   o  If there is no SRV resource record, pursue the fallback methods
      described in [RFC6120].

   o  Use the 'to' address of the initial stream header to determine the
      domain name of the TLS client's reference identifier (since use of
      the Server Name Indication extension (TLS SNI) [RFC6066] is purely
      discretionary in XMPP, as mentioned in [RFC6120]).

5.2.  POSH

   The POSH prooftype can be defined as follows:

   1.  The server's proof consists of a PKIX certificate.





Saint-Andre, et al.      Expires August 20, 2015               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   2.  The proof is checked according to the rules from [RFC6120] and
       [RFC6125].

   3.  The client's verification material is obtained by retrieving a
       hash of the PKIX certificate over HTTPS at a well-known URI
       [RFC5785].

   4.  Secure DNS is not necessary since the HTTPS retrieval mechanism
       relies on the chain of trust from the public key infrastructure.

   POSH is defined in [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh].  For XMPP purposes, the
   following rules apply:

   o  If no verification materials are found via POSH, pursue the
      fallback methods described in [RFC6120].

   o  Use the 'to' address of the initial stream header to determine the
      domain name of the TLS client's reference identifier (since use of
      the Server Name Indication extension (TLS SNI) [RFC6066] is purely
      discretionary in XMPP, as mentioned in [RFC6120]).

   The well-known URIs [RFC5785] to be used for POSH are:

   o  "/.well-known/posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json" for client-to-server
      connections

   o  "/.well-known/posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json" for server-to-server
      connections

6.  Secure Delegation and Multi-Tenancy

   One common method for deploying XMPP services is multi-tenancy: e.g.,
   XMPP services for the service domain example.com are actually hosted
   at the target server hosting.example.net.  Such an arrangement is
   relatively convenient in XMPP given the use of DNS SRV records
   [RFC2782], such as the following delegation from example.com to
   hosting.example.net:

   _xmpp-server._tcp.example.com. 0 IN SRV 0 0 5269 hosting.example.net

   Secure connections with multi-tenancy can work using the PKIX
   prooftype on a small scale if the provider itself wishes to host
   several domains (e.g., related domains such as jabber-de.example and
   jabber-ch.example).  However, in practice the security of multi-
   tenancy has been found to be unwieldy when the provider hosts large
   numbers of XMPP services on behalf of multiple tenants (see
   [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh] for a detailed description).  Typically there
   are two main reasons for this state of affairs: the service provider



Saint-Andre, et al.      Expires August 20, 2015               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   (say, hosting.example.net) wishes to limit its liability and
   therefore does not wish to hold the certificate and private key for
   the tenant (say, example.com) and the tenant wishes to improve the
   security of the service and therefore does not wish to share its
   certificate and private key with the service provider.  As a result,
   server-to-server communications to example.com go unencrypted or the
   communications are TLS-encrypted but the certificates are not checked
   (which is functionally equivalent to a connection using an anonymous
   key exchange).  This is also true of client-to-server communications,
   forcing end users to override certificate warnings or configure their
   clients to accept or "pin" certificates for hosting.example.net
   instead of example.com.  The fundamental problem here is that if
   DNSSEC is not used then the act of delegation via DNS SRV records is
   inherently insecure.

   The specification for use of SRV records with DANE
   [I-D.ietf-dane-srv] explains how to use DNSSEC for secure delegation
   with the DANE prooftype, and the POSH specification
   [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh] explains how to use HTTPS redirects for secure
   delegation with the POSH prooftype.

7.  Prooftype Model

   In general, a domain name association (DNA) prooftype conforms to the
   following definition:

   prooftype:  A mechanism for proving an association between a domain
      name and an XML stream, where the mechanism defines (1) the nature
      of the server's proof, (2) the matching rules for comparing the
      client's verification material against the server's proof, (3) how
      the client obtains its verification material, and (4) whether the
      mechanism depends on secure DNS.

   The PKIX, DANE, and POSH prooftypes adhere to this model.  (Some
   prooftypes depend on, or are enhanced by, secure DNS and thus also
   need to describe how they ensure secure delegation.)

   Other prooftypes are possible; examples might include TLS with PGP
   keys [RFC6091], a token mechanism such as Kerberos [RFC4120] or OAuth
   [RFC6749], and Server Dialback keys [XEP-0220].

   Although the PKIX prooftype reuses the syntax of the XMPP Server
   Dialback protocol [XEP-0220] for signalling between servers, this
   framework document does not define how the generation and validation
   of Server Dialback keys (also specified in [XEP-0220]) is a DNA
   prooftype.  However, nothing in this document prevents the continued
   use of Server Dialback for signaling, and a future specification (or

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                   February 2015


   an updated version of [XEP-0220]) might define a DNA prooftype for
   Server Dialback keys in a way that is consistent with this framework.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The POSH specification [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh] provides guidelines for
   registering the well-known URIs [RFC5785] of protocols that make use
   of POSH.  This specification registers two such URIs, for which the
   completed registration templates follow.

8.1.  Well-Known URI for xmpp-client Service

   This specification registers "posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json" in the
   Well-Known URI Registry as defined by [RFC5785].

   URI suffix: posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): [[ this document ]]

8.2.  Well-Known URI for xmpp-server Service

   This specification registers "posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json" in the
   Well-Known URI Registry as defined by [RFC5785].

   URI suffix: posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): [[ this document ]]

9.  Security Considerations

   With regard to the PKIX prooftype, this document supplements but does
   not supersede the security considerations of [RFC6120] and [RFC6125].

   With regard to the DANE and PKIX prooftypes, the reader is referred
   to [I-D.ietf-dane-srv] and [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh], respectively.

   Any future prooftypes need to thoroughly describe how they conform to
   the prooftype model specified in Section 7 of this document.
