1.  Introduction.

   For the purpose of management it is necessary to access Managed
   Objects (MOs). The SNMP framework provides a mechanism for naming and
   describing managed objects.  These objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store termed a Management Information Base (MIB). MIBs
   have been defined by equipment, protocol and, application developers
   to provide management access to the managed entities. We will call
   the MOs defined in these MIBs - simple MOs (SMO). Management
   applications will access one or more of these MOs, one or more times,
   to monitor the target entity.

   There is a cost associated with polling. The cost is the network
   bandwidth and the packet header processing overhead at the command
   generator (manager) and the command responder (agent). This cost
   constrains the number of objects that can be polled and the interval
   at which polling can be carried out.

   The overhead reduction can be carried out by reducing the number of
   query-response packets. This will reduce the packet processing
   overhead and to some extent the bandwidth.

   The payloads in a typical SNMP "get" packet and the corresponding
   response are as shown in Fig. 1. In the example shown in the figure
   polling is carried out for 'n' Managed Objects (MOs) OID1, OID2, ..,
   OIDn. It is obvious that a substantial amount of the payload in an
   SNMP packet consists of the OIDs. In [ODC-Dft] OID compression has
   been proposed by using the OID Delta Compression mechanism.

   In this draft a mechanism of MO aggregation for payload compression
   is defined.  The idea is simple: we introduce the concept of an
   Aggregate MO (AgMO). An AgMO is just another MO as far as the SNMP
   protocol is concerned. No new protocol operations will be required to
   handle these MOs. As in the case of any other MO it requires
   additional instrumentaion  at the command responder (agent) and at
   the (command generator) manager. In this  mechanism the user defines
   an Aggregate MO (AgMO) corresponding to one or more (predefined) MOs.
   Semantically, the AgMO will be equivalent to the concatenation of the
   values of the specified MOs. With the definitions done, the user can,
   as and when the necessity arises, do a get on instances of the AgMO
   to fetch the value of instances of the constituent MOs. There is
   substantial savings on bandwidth as the only one instance object
   identifier is carried in the request and the response. In the normal
   case, instance object identifiers for each of the constituent MO
   instances would be carried in the requests and the response. This is
   the basic concept of Aggregate Managed Objects.

   The concepts are explained in Fig. 2. An aggregate managed object

   AgMOx has been defined for MO instances MOI1, ... MOIn. The value of
   an instance of AgMOx will be a concatenation of the values of of
   MOI1, ... MOIn, in that order.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580
        [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine

Internet Draft                                          September 7 2002


   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  The Requirements for Managed Object aggregation

   The general requirements of managed object aggregation are as
   follows:

          o It should lead to lesser number of packets
          o It should lead to lesser bandwidth consumption

   It should not
          o lead to loss of information

   In case of time-based aggregation  there may be a delay involved in
   getting the actual data. The minimum delay in this case will be the
   duration of the aggregation.

   The manager application is expected to configure aggregate MOs with
   care so that the response size is not too large. In case
    the resultant response size is larger than the maximum acceptable
   message size of the originator or larger than the local maximum
   message size then the error-status field will be set to "tooBig".


4.  MIB Design.

The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as  possible and
at the same time to make it flexible enough so that a large number of
users and applications can use the MIB to configure aggregate MOs
conveniently.

The MIB comprises of three tables described below.
    - The aggrCtlTable controls the aggregation process. Each row in
      this table defines the attributes of aggregate object defined in
      the aggrMOTable.

    - The aggrMOTable defines the primary MO-based aggregation
      i.e. the MOs that will be aggregated.

    - The aggrDataTable contains the details of the aggregated object
      The size of the table may be decided by implementations.

Security Considerations

   There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and read-create. There is the risk that
   an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   via direct SNMP SET operations. So, care must be taken to put in place
   the security provisions of SNMP for authentication and access control.
   Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) and SET (write) the objects in this MIB.

   It is strongly recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [RFC2274] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [RFC2275] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
