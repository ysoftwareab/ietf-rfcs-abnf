        Definition of Managed Objects for Performance Reporting
                     draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-04

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report
   generation on any device that supports MIBs containing objects that
   resolve to type Integer32 (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or
   TimeTicks). to be used for performance monitoring.  This allows a
   management station to instruct a device to build off-line reports to
   be collected either through notifications to the management station
   or queried asynchronously by the management station.  Hence, this
   capability allows network operators to reduce the SNMP polling
   traffic burden on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant Networks
   which is problematic of SNMP performance management applications.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous, off-
   line report generation for performance monitoring on any device
   supporting MIBs containing variables that resolve to type Integer32
   (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks).  This
   reportSampledMIB module allows for the report generation to occur on
   the same device as containing the referenced counter object.  This
   should be useful to devices or networks where efficient use of
   bandwidth is of concern or where intermittent connectivity is common.
   Hence, the reportSampledMIB module is useful for devices managed over
   some Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) or Disruption Tolerant Networks
   (DTNs).

   This version of the reportSampledMIB module offers one type of off-
   line reporting.  The MIB offers a means to collect sampled
   measurements related to defined MIB objects.  This type of reporting
   is contained in the reportSampledMibObjects.  Other types of report
   data are possible, including statistical data.  However, it was felt
   wise to focus on a more limited scope off-line reporting capability
   and gain experimental use and application prior to expending energy
   developing a more extensive off line reporting capability.

   The reportSampledMIB module relies upon the dismanEventMIB module RFC
   2981 [RFC2981] to monitor the progress of reports being developed
   within the reportSampledMIB module and to trigger an events, i.e.,
   notifications containing reports, at the appropriate times.  This is
   discussed below in more detail in the section entitled 'Relationship
   to the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB'.  Further, more sophisticated performance
   objects for monitoring from the reportSampledMIB module can be
   defined through the dismanExpressionMIB module RFC 2982 [RFC2982]

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The reportSampledMIB module references performance objects in other
   MIBs and generates off-line performance reports related to those
   referenced objects.  The reportSampledMIB module can be coincident
   with the other MIB modules on the same device containing the
   referenced performance related object.

4.1.  reportSampledMIB Module Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the reportSampledMIB
   module process.

   The reportSampledMIB module objects are primarily contained within
   four tables.  These are:

   o  reportSampledControlTable - this is the control table within the
      reportSampledMIB module.  This identifies the OIDs to be monitored
      which define the core of the Reports.  The control table sets the
      sampling frequency for the Measurements and the number of
      Measurements that will define each Report.

   o  reportSampledCurrentReportsStatusTable - This table tracks the
      status, i.e., the current number of collected Measurements per
      each Study.  This information can be used by the dismanEventMIB
      module to determine when to trigger a notification to the Report
      owner containing the Measurements and associated data comprising
      the just completed Report.

   o  reportSampledCurrentReportsTable - This table holds the
      Measurements for the Reports which are in current development.

   o  reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable - This table holds the
      completed Reports for each Study for archival purposes, i.e., the
      Study owners can perform table walks to retrieve archived Reports
      or Studies.

   The below figure illustrates the four main tables within the
   reportSampledMIB module.  Further, if the dismanEventMIB module is so
   configured to generate triggered notifications, the below figure
   highlights the 'boolean trigger' and the notification generation.
   The figure further illustrates the movement of completed Reports from

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Sampled - periodic measurement of target OIDs.

   o  Measurement - a single instance of a sampling event.

   o  Report - a collection of consecutive Measurements on the same
      Sampled target OID.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


   o  Study - a series of Reports on the same Sampled target OID.

   o  Current Report - a Report which is in the process of being
      developed.

   o  A Completed Report - contains a pre-defined number of Sampled
      Measurements.

   o  Historical Report - a Report which has previously Completed, and
      is being stored locally for archival purposes.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the reportSampledMIB module.
   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  reportSampledMibNotifications - defines the notifications
      associated with the reportSampledMIB module.  These objects define
      notifications which track the behavior of the reportSampledMib
      module.  A single notification is defined in the reportSampledMIB
      module which reports a series of failed measurement attempts in
      the process of building a Report.  Associated with this
      notification is a control object which defines a threshold of
      failures which would initiate the notification.  These
      notifications do not cover the triggered notifications which carry
      the performance Reports generated by the reportSampledMib module.
      These triggered notifications are defined through the use of the
      dismanEventMIB module.

   o  reportSampledMibObjects - defines the objects forming the basis
      for the reportSampledMIB module.  These objects are basically
      divided up by function into the following four tables:

      *  reportSampledControlTable - This group contains the objects
         which support the generation (collection) of Studies comprising
         of Reports exposing sampled Measurement values.

      *  reportSampledCurrentReportsStatusTable - This group contains
         the objects which track the collection of Measurements for
         current (in-progress) Reports.  This table allows the
         dismanEventMIB module to set triggers for Completed Reports
         which it can then send to the report owner through triggered
         notifications.

      *  reportSampledCurrentReportsTable - This group contains the
         objects which represent the Measurement data associated with
         Current (in-progress) Reports.  Once the Report completes, it
         is moved to the reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable for

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


         archival purposes.

      *  reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable - This group contains the
         objects which represent archived Completed Reports.  This
         allows the report owners to asynchronously retrieve Reports via
         table walks if so desired.

   o  reportSampledMibConformance - Defines a single basic conformance
      of implementations of this reportSampledMIB module.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   No textual conventions are defined in the reportSampledMIB module.

5.2.  Tables and Indexing

   The reportSampledMIB module contains four tables which control and
   record data related to the creation, notification and storage of
   Reports.  Specifically:

   o  the control and generation of remote performance Reports, i.e.,
      reportSampledControlTable

   o  the status of the Current Reports' development, i.e.,
      reportSampledCurrentReportsStatusTable,

   o  the Current Reports development and interim data, i.e.,
      reportSampledCurrentReportsTable, and

   o  the historical storage of remote performance Reports, i.e.
      reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable.

   The reportSampledMIB module's tables are indexed via the following
   constructs:

   o  reportSampledStudyIndex - an index that uniquely identifies a
      particular Study.  The Study is comprised of multiple Reports, the
      number of Reports being stored is defined by the
      reportSampledStudyMaximumNumberOfHistoricalReports object.

   o  reportSampledCurrentMeasurementIndex - an index that uniquely
      identifies an atomic Measurement associated with a Report.

   o  reportSampledHistoricalReportIndex - an index that uniquely
      identifies an archived Completed Report resident within the
      reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


   o  reportSampledHistoricalMeasurementIndex - an index that uniquely
      identifies an atomic Measurement comprising an archived Completed
      Report.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  reportSampledControlTable - this table contains a list of data-
      collection configuration entries defining aspects of the studies
      and their reports to be generated.  These include, e.g., number of
      reports per study, the number Reports to be archived, etc.  This
      table has 'INDEX { reportSampledStudyIndex }'.

   o  reportSampledCurrentReportsStatusTable - this table contains
      objects which track the development of current Reports, e.g., the
      number of current Measurements collected for each Report under
      development.  This table has 'INDEX { reportSampledStudyIndex }'.
      For each (active) Study, there exists only one Current Report
      under development.

   o  reportSampledCurrentReportsTable - this table contains the
      Measurements which are developing the Current Reports.  This table
      has 'INDEX { reportSampledStudyIndex,
      reportSampledCurrentMeasurementIndex }'.

   o  reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable - this table contains the
      Reports which have completed.  This table has 'INDEX {
      reportSampledStudyIndex, reportSampledHistoricalReportIndex,
      reportSampledHistoricalMeasurementIndex }'.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The text of this section specifies the relationship of the MIB
   modules contained in this document to other standards, particularly
   to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from
   other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The reportSampledMIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


6.2.  Relationship to the RMON2-MIB

   The reportSampledMIB module is closely related to and was inspired by
   the the RMON2-MIB module [RFC2021] usrHistoryGroup.  The use of
   control tables to establish the periodic collection of measurement
   data for creation of performance reports was pulled from earlier work
   on the RMON2-MIB module.

6.3.  Relationship to the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB

   The reportSampledMIB module was developed to fundamentally work with
   the dismanEventMIB module RFC 2981 [RFC2981] in order to offer a
   complete and efficient off-line reporting capability for bandwidth
   challenged networks such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).  This is
   accomplished through defining trigger test and associated
   notification actions indexed by mteOwner, mteTriggerName,
   mteObjectsName and mteEventName within the dismanEventMIB module.
   Specifically (within the dismanEventMIB module):

   In the mteTriggerTable and specifically by setting

   o  'mteTriggerTest == boolean(1)',

   o  'mteTriggerSampleType == absoluteValue(1)',

   o  'mteTriggerValueID ==
      reportSampledNumberOfMeasurementsForCurrentReport',

   o  'mteTriggerValueIDWildcard == false(1)',

   o  'mteTriggerFrequency == 0.5*reportSampledStudySamplingInterval',
      and

   o  'mteTriggerEnabled == true'.

   In the mteTriggerBooleanTable and specifically by setting

   o  'mteTriggerBooleanComparison == equal(2)',

   o  'mteTriggerBooleanValue == value of
      reportSampledStudyNumberReportMeasurements', and

   o  'mteTriggerBooleanStartup == false'.

   In the mteObjectsTable and specifically by setting






Cole, et al.              Expires June 10, 2015                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


   o  'mteObjectsID == reportSampledCurrentMeasurementValue' and
      reportSampledCurrentMeasurementTime' and
      reportSampledCurrentMeasurementStatus' with

   o  'mteObjectsIDWildcard == true' // for each.

   In the mteEventTable and specifically by setting

   o  'mteEventActions == notification(0)' and

   o  'mteEventEnabled == true' // for each.

   In the mteEventNotificationTable and specifically by setting

   o  'mteEventNotification == mteTriggerFired' and the appropriate
      names for the

   o  'mteEventNotificationObjectOwner == mteOwner' and

   o  'mteEventNotificationObjects == mteObjectsName'.

   These settings within the dismanEventMIB module will result in
   notifications generated by the dismanEventMIB module which will carry
   the recently completed reportSampledMIB module reports.

   Set up properly, the dismanEventMIB module will trigger a
   notification each time the reportSampledCurrentTable contains a
   completed Report.  This Report will be sent in a notification
   containing three columns of the reportSampledCurrentTable, i.e., the
   Value, the Time and the Status, due to the use of wildcarding within
   the dismanEventMIB module.

   Simultaneously, the reportSampledMIB module will move the completed
   Current Report into the reportSampledHistoricalReportsTable and
   restart collection for the next Report within the

6.4.  Relationship to the DISMAN-EXPRESSION-MIB

   In conjunction with the dismanExpressionMIB module RFC 2982
   [RFC2982], the reportSampledMIB module can be used to develop reports
   on relatively sophisticated object expressions.

6.5.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any module
   mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a REFERENCE
   clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited someplace within

8.  Security Considerations

   This reportSampledMIB module defines a capability where the local
   device may poll other MIB modules on the device to collect
   performance data.  These capabilities defined within the
   reportSampledMIB module are control-able by a network management
   application through SNMP.  As such, a network management application
   could potentially use the reportSampledMIB module as a mechanism to
   implement a limited Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack
   against remote devices by overloading their SNMP processing.  Care
   should be taken to secure access to the reportSampledMIB module
   agent.  Specifically, access control mechanisms and authentication
   mechanisms (via SNMPv3) should always be used for SNMP SET
   operations.  Further, some objects may contain data deemed sensitive
   and authentication and encryption mechanisms (via SNMPv3) should be
   used for SNMP GET operations.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The reportSampledControlTable is a writable table whose columnar
      objects are read-create.  The following objects with MAX ACCESS of
      read-create and their security sensitivities are:

   o

      *  reportSampledStudyOwner - this object is an administrative
         string which identifies the the owner of the Study.

      *  reportSampledStudyName - this object is an administrative
         string which gives a name to the Study defined by the objects
         in this table.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


      *  reportSampledStudyOid - this object identifies the the Object
         ID from another MIB module resident on this local device which
         forms the measurement basis for the Study.  Depending upon the
         object and the associated process responsible for its
         maintenance, polling this object too frequently may place an
         undo burden on the process resulting in diminishing its overall
         ability to perform its operation.

      *  reportSampledStudySamplingInterval - this object identifies the
         time interval being sampling events.  If set too low, the
         device may not be able to sample the object on remote devices
         fast enough to satisfy the requested interval.  Further,
         setting this value too low could be used to overwhelm the
         processing capabilities of the remote agent, resulting in a
         form of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.

      *  reportSampledStudyNumberReportsMeasurements - this object
         identifies the requested number of measurements (and associated
         storage/memory) for each identified object for each Study
         instance.  As such, this related to the total device memory
         necessary to hold the collected data for the identified
         reports.  The device must determine whether it has the
         necessary storage.  If not, the device can reject this value
         when requested by returning the .... to protect itself against
         memory overruns.

      *  reportSampledStudyMaximumNumberOfHistoricalReports - this
         object identifies the requested number of Reports for each
         identified object for each Study instance.  As such, this
         related to the total device memory necessary to hold the
         collected data for the identified reports.  The device must
         determine whether it has the necessary storage.  If not, the
         device can reject this value when requested by returning the
         .... to protect itself against memory overruns.

      *  reportSampledStudyEntryStatus - this is the RowStatus object
         controlling the configuration of this table row.

   o  The reportSampledCurrentReportsStatusTable is a read-only table
      containing state information.  The information in this Table
      relates to performance measurements on the underlying Mobile Ad-
      Hoc Network (MANET).  As such, some of this information may be
      deemed sensitive to the overall performance of the MANET and to
      the organization to which the MANET belongs.

      Hoc Network (MANET).  As such, some of this information may be
      deemed sensitive to the overall performance of the MANET and to

   o  The reportSampledHistoricalReportsStatusTable is a read-only table
      containing state information.  The information in this Table
      relates to performance measurements on the underlying Mobile Ad-
      Hoc Network (MANET).  As such, some of this information may be
      deemed sensitive to the overall performance of the MANET and to
      the organization to which the MANET belongs.

   o  The reportSampledDataCollectionFailure notification object reports
      information regarding the inability of the reportSampledMIB module
      from completing its configured reporting mission, including the
      specific information that the module is failing to collect.  To
      some organizations this information may be deemed sensitive to its
      mission and may want to protect this information through
      encryption mechanisms.

   o  The reportSampledDataCollectionFailureThreshold object controls
      the ability of the device to report information regarding the
      inability of the reportSampledMIB module from completing its
      configured reporting mission.  If set to low, notifications may be
      produced too frequently causing processor burdens to the agent and
      the collecting manager, and generating too much management traffic
      for a bandwidth constrained MANET to support.  If set too high,
      notifications may not be produced frequently enough for the
      collecting manager to properly track the MANET system performance.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   remote report generation process on a router or other device.  This
   MIB module, denoted reportSampledMIB module, also reports performance
   information and notifications.  The reportSampledMIB module provides
   for the remote control, collection and notification of performance
   reports on devices.  As such, it eliminates the need for periodic
   polling for counters from remote management stations as a means for
   generating performance reports.  This is hoped to greatly reduce
   management overhead on the MANET.  This sections provides some
   examples of how this MIB module can be used in MANET network
   deployments.  A fuller discussion of MANET network management use
   cases and challenges will be provided elsewhere.

   In the following, two scenarios are identified where this MIB module
   is useful.  This list is not complete and other scenarios are
   possible.

   o  For Mobile vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed
      Network Operations Center (NOC) - Here the vehicles carrying the
      MANET routers carry multiple wireless interfaces, one of which is
      a relatively low-bandwidth on-the-move satellite connection which
      interconnects a fix NOC to the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-
      based methods for monitoring and fault management from the fixed
      NOC are necessary for this deployment option.  However, to reduce
      polling overhead over the low bandwidth communications links, the
      reportSampledMIB module can be deployed the remote MANET nodes for
      the remote generation of performance reports.

   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for
      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is
      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from a fixed
      NOC while local management, as provided by this reportSampledMIB
      module is performed locally from within the vehicles.  Standards-
      based methods for configuration, monitoring, fault and performance
      management are necessary for this deployment option.

              Standard Management Framework", RFC 3410, December 2002.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Changes from draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-03 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-04 draft.

   1.  This version 04 of the reportSampledMIB module represents a
       fairly significant restructuring of the MIB module.  This
       restructuring was necessary in order to align the remote
       distributed reporting capabilities of this MIB module with the
       prior DISMAN Working Group (WG) efforts at the IETF.

   2.  The reportSampledCurrentReportsStatusTable was added to allow a
       network manager to automate notifications of completed reports
       from this MIB module using the dismanEventMIB module.

   3.  The notifications in this reportSampledMIB module were reduced to
       only notifications related to the operation of the data
       collections and no longer addressing the reporting of the
       performance data itself.  This later data is now carried in
       notifications under the control of the dismanEventMIB module.

   Changes from draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-01 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-02 draft.

   1.  Stripped the Statistical and the Historical Reports from this
       draft in order to greatly simplify the initial development and
       experiments of this MIB module.

   2.  Changed the RFC category to Experimental.

   3.  Completed the Security section.

   4.  Relied upon the AUGMENTS statement to simplify further this MIB
       definition.

   Changes from draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-00 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Proposed additions to the statsReports in order to potentially
       simplify data transmission to management applications.

   2.  Added some Notification definitions and their relationship to the
       three reports' structure, i.e., statsReports, sampledReports, and
       historyReports.

   3.  In the process of adding notifications for the Sampled and the
       History reports, decided to restructure the reports from their
       previously rolling storage model to the fixed interval reporting
       used all along in the Statistics reporting.  This allows the
       agent to notify the management application that a report has
       completed and that it is ready to be pulled from the agent
       storage.

   4.  Ran MIB through smilint checker and cleaned up all errors and
       most warnings.  A few warnings remain to be addressed.

   5.  Cleaned up textual material.

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-02 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-00 draft.

   1.  Major change was the incorporation of the IP address objects
       associated with all objects of type 'OBJECT IDENTIFIER'.  This
       allows the reportSampledMIB module to exist as a proxy report
       generation capability on a device separate but in close proximity
       to the device monitoring the referenced object.

   2.  Cleaned up the up front text, reducing the repetition with the
       object descriptions in the MIB.

   3.  Worked on and added sections discussing the relationship to other
       MIBs.

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-01 to
   draft-cole-manet-report-mib-02 draft.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            December 2014


   1.  Restructured the MIB somewhat to now offer the three reporting
       capabilities in increasing order of detail: a) statistical
       reports, b) sampled reports, and c) historical reports.

   2.  Renamed the usrHistoryGroup and elements to samplingGroup.  This
       is in line with its actual capabilities.

   3.  Added a new historyGroup which provides a history of change
       events.

   4.  Updated the4 Conformance section to reflect the above changes and
       additions.  But did not yet run smilint to check MIB syntax.

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-00 to
   draft-cole-manet-report-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Added (copied) the usrHistory group from RMON2 into the
       reportSampledMIB module.

   2.  Restructured the MIB to account for the inclusion of the
       reportSampledMibObjects.

   3.  Dropped the reportCurReportsTable as this did not make sense
       within the context of the reportSampledMIB module.

   4.  Added the Compliance and Conformance material.  Defined several
       Compliance Groups to all for base implementations of the
       reportSampledMIB module for only statistical reports, for only
       historical reports or for both.  Allow for enhanced
       implementations to address higher capacity issues and extension
       to metric reporting for statistical reporting.

   5.  Ran the MIB through the smilint checker and in the process
       corrected numerous typos, omissions, TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS,
       IMPORTS, etc.

   6.  Updated main text to reflect changes.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the reportSampledMIB module.  This section
   will not be present in the final version of the MIB and will be
   removed once all the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  Provide references within the REFERENCE clauses in the MIB
       module.

   2.  Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
       DESCRIPTION clauses.

   3.  Request an initial review of this MIB module by a MIB Doctor
       familiar with the work of the DISMAN WG, preferably an author of
       the dismanEventMIB module.
