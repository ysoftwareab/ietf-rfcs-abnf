                   simple priority.

IQS = 01: In this case, the Input Service Selector is an opaque
                   service profile identifier.  The definition of these
                   service profiles is outside the scope of this
                   specification.  Service Profiles can be used to
                   indicate pre-defined Differentiated Service Per Hop
                   Behaviours.

IQS = 10: In this case, the Input Service Selector corresponds
                   to a Service Spec as defined in Chapter 8.2.  When
                   the value of either IQS or OQS is set to 0b10, then a
                   Traffic Parameters Block is appended to the message.

IQS = 11: In this case the Input Service Selector corresponds
                   to an ARM service specification.  Definition of ARM
                   service specifications is outside the scope of this
                   specification and is determined by the MType as
                   defined in Chapter 8.1.
