Abstract

   Distribution of high precision time and frequency over the Internet
   and special purpose IP networks is becoming more and more needed as
   IP networks replace legacy networks and as new applications with need
   for frequency and time are developed on the Internet.  The IETF
   formed the TICTOC working group to address the problem and perform an
   analysis on existing solutions and the needs.  This document
   summarizes application needs, as described and agreed on at an TICTOC
   interim meeting held in Paris from June 16 to 18, 2008.

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


1.  Introduction

   There is an emerging need to distribute highly accurate time and
   frequency information over IP and over MPLS packet switched networks
   (PSNs).  In this draft, the requirements for transporting accurate
   time and/or frequency are addressed.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


3.  Applications Requirements

   There are many applications that need synchronization.  Some
   applications only need frequency; for others a combination of
   frequency and time of day or phase may be required.  At the TICTOC
   interim meeting, it was agreed that these applications be grouped
   based on what was believed to be common requirements, and where the
   requirements where distinct from each other.  This section describes
   these applications (or groups of applications) that was agreed on at
   the TICTOC interim meeting.

3.1.  Cellular Backhauling

   Within Cellular backhauling, there are several applications that need
   to be considered.  Some of these applications only require frequency
   information, others require time-of-day, and others require phase.
   The cellular backhauling applications to be considered are:

   o  GSM

   o  Mobile Wimax

   o  LTE

   o  UMTS FDD

   o  UMTS TDD

   o  CDMA2000

   o  TD-SCDMA

   Conventionally GSM and UMTS FDD base stations obtain this reference

   frequency by locking on to the E1/T1 that links them to the base
   station controller.  With the replacement of TDM links with Packet
   Switched Networks (PSNs) such as Ethernet, IP or MPLS, this simple
   method of providing a frequency reference is lost, and frequency
   information must be made available in some other way.

   The synchronization requirement is derived from the need for the
   radio frequencies to be accurate.  Radio spectrum is a limited and
   valuable commodity that needs to be used as efficiently as possible.
   In GSM, transmission frequencies are allocated to a given cellular
   base station and its neighbours in such fashion as to ensure that
   they do not interfere with each other.  If the radio network designer
   cannot rely on the accuracy of these frequencies, the spacing between
   the frequencies used by neighbouring sites must be increased, with
   significant economic consequences.

   There is an additional requirement derived from the need for smooth
   handover when a mobile station crosses from one cell to another.  If
   the radio system designer can not guarantee that the preparations
   required for handover occur in a few milliseconds, then they must
   allow the mobile station to consume frequency resources
   simultaneously in both cells in order to avoid service disruption.
   The preparations required involve agreement between the mobile and
   base stations on the new frequencies and time offsets; these
   agreements can be accomplished quickly when the two base stations'
   frequency references are the same to a high degree of accuracy.

3.1.1.  Cellular Backhauling

   The requirements for the "Cellular Backhauling" are depicted in the
   following sections.

3.1.2.  Cellular Backhaul Requirements Summary

   Based on the sections above, the following can be summarized for the
   cellular backhaul applications.  Two families of technologies can be
   identified:

   o  Those only requiring the recovery of an accurate and stable
      frequency synchronization signal as a reference for the radio
      signal (e.g.  GSM, UMTS FDD, LTE FDD).  In this case the
      requirement ranges between 15 ppb (Wimax) and 250 ppb (UMTS Home
      Base Stations).  This requirement is applicable on the air
      interface.  In practice more accurate frequency on the long term
      is required at the input of the Base Stations (e.g. 16 ppb might
      be required for applications operating with 50 ppb)

   o  Mobile technologies that in addition to frequency synchronization,
      also need phase synchronization.  This is the case for the TDD
      technologies such as UMTS TDD.  The requirement in this case
      ranges between 2.5 microseconds (phase error between Base
      Stations) to several tens of microseconds that could be sufficient



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


      for some LTE TDD configurations.  There is also a case (CDMA2000)
      that in addition to phase synchronization also requires the
      distribution of accurate time of day (3 microseconds max error
      during normal operation).

3.2.  Circuit Emulation

   The PWE3 WG has produced three techniques for emulating traditional
   low-rate (E1, T1, E3, T3) TDM services over PSNs, namely SAToP
   [RFC4553], CESoPSN [RFC5086], and TDMoIP [RFC5087].  The Network
   Synchronization reference model and deployment scenarios for
   emulation of TDM services have been described in [RFC4197], Section
   4.3.  The major technical challenge for TDM pseudowires is the
   accuracy of its clock recovery.

   TDM network standards for timing accuracy and stability are extremely
   demanding.  These requirements are not capriciously dictated by
   standards bodies, rather they are critical to the proper functioning
   of a high-speed TDM network.  Consider a TDM receiver utilizing its
   own clock when converting the physical signal back into a bit-stream.
   If the receive clock runs at precisely the same rate as the source
   clock, then the receiver need only determine the optimal sampling
   phase.  However, with any mismatch of clock rates, no matter how
   small, bit slips will eventually occur.  For example, if the receive
   clock is slower than the source clock by one part per million (ppm),
   then the receiver will output 999,999 bits for every 1,000,000 bits
   sent, thus deleting one bit.  Similarly, if the receive clock is
   faster than the source clock by one part per billion (ppb), the
   receiver will insert a spurious bit every billion bits.  One bit slip
   every million bits may seem acceptable at first glance, but
   translates to a catastrophic two errors per second for a 2 Mb/s E1
   signal.  ITU-T recommendations permit a few bit slips per day for a
   low-rate 64 kb/s channel, but strive to prohibit bit slips entirely
   for higher-rate TDM signals.

3.2.1.  Circuit Emulation Requirements

   The requirements for the Circuit Emulation are as follows:

3.2.2.  Circuit Emulation Requirements Summary

   The Circuit Emulation application requires the receiver to recover
   the same long term frequency accuracy as the original TDM signal.
   The phase noise (jitter and wander) of the recovered signal has to be
   limited according to the relevant ITU-T recommendation (e.g.  G.823).
   There are no requirements on phase or time synchronization in this
   case.

3.3.  Test and Measurement

   Note: The application information and the requirements for this
   section was provided by the LXI Consortium Technical Committee.

   In the test and measurement sector there is a desire to move from
   special purpose communications infrastructure with calibrated wiring
   run back to a centralize controller, to a distributed system, in
   which instructions are distributed in advance to be executed at a
   predetermined time, and in which measurements are taken remotely and
   communicated back to a common point for later correlation and
   analysis.

   Test and Measurement (T&M) is a very diverse industry and as would be
   expected, requirements vary widely with the application.  However the
   vast majority of the newer instruments and systems make use of LAN
   technology and many have a connection to the local enterprise network
   for data transfer, or monitoring and control.

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


   Because of the increasingly heavy use of LAN technology in T&M
   instruments and systems, we are dependent on the availability of
   network infrastructure, e.g. bridges, and low level silicon, e.g.
   PHYs and PHY/MAC, that supports not only T&M connectivity (data
   transport) but increasingly timing and frequency transfer support as
   well.

   Furthermore T&M is going to require this support not only for the
   existing 10/100/1000 BaseT technology but on the newer high
   throughput LAN technology under development.  While most instruments
   produce data at modest rates, many can source or sink data at rates
   well in excess of 40Gsamples/s.  In addition, the time and phase
   coherence requirements on the data transport, e.g.  LAN, typically
   are tighter on the high data rate instruments.

   The other major headache in the use of LAN in T&M is latency and
   jitter because it compromises the determinism needed for some
   applications.  One of the promises of LAN-based precise time is that
   in many circumstances precise time can be used to overcome latency
   issues.  For example, for many data acquisition applications the
   ability to precisely and accurately timestamp data at the collection
   point makes LAN latency and jitter a non-issue.

   Many T&M applications are localized, often to a bench or rack of
   equipment.  The LAN will be local and private although there is often
   a connection to the local enterprise network.  It is not uncommon in
   such applications to include a rubidium oscillator to provide a
   phase-coherent stable frequency source to critical instrumentation
   such as counters, scopes, signal generators and analyzers.  In many
   cases the LAN, in principle, could fill the frequency distribution
   role if the LAN technology supported it.  In these systems time
   transfer is becoming important first for timestamping data to
   facilitate data management and post acquisition processing, and in
   some cases as part of the control structure.  The precise time
   specifications vary from milliseconds for general applications to
   nanoseconds for the most critical.

   There is an important class of applications where time, and sometimes
   frequency traceable to international standards is required, generally
   due to regulatory issues, e.g. testing of medical, safety critical or
   military devices.  The ability to deliver traceable time and
   frequency over the network to the enterprise would be a big help in
   these applications.

   There are also T&M applications that are widely distributed due to
   the nature of the device or system being measured.  Environmental
   measurement systems, surveillance, SCADA systems, and the
   telecommunication system itself are examples.  Timestamping data is



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


   an essential requirement to overcome the communication latency and
   jitter issues.  The specific timing requirements clearly cover a wide
   range.  Environmental and SCADA is typically a ms.  However to really
   instrument a telecom system will require timing at least on the order
   of a packet length or better.  Even more extreme are timing for RF
   test ranges (which can cover several miles), long-baseline
   interferometry, and RF surveillance where the time accuracy must be
   on the order of ns.  In some cases public networks will be used if
   the time distribution is adequate.

3.3.1.  Test and Measurement Requirements

   The requirements for the Test and Measurement are summarized in this
   section.  Where appropriate both the low and high end of the
   requirements spectrum are given to illustrate the breadth of
   requirements for the application areas discussed.  Note that
   typically the applications with the most demanding requirements are
   also the high dollar value applications and in many cases the most
   critical in terms of the cost of failure, e.g. failure of a
   surveillance system, monitoring of telecommunications, military test
   systems where either the operational cost of downtime or the cost of
   the device being tested is high.

   The requirements for the Test and Measurement are as follows:


  Synchronization Type (e.g. time, frequency or phase): Time: ms to ns -
         high value applications will open up as this spec improves.
         Frequency: part in 10^9 minimum, 10^11 desirable and with the
         lowest phase noise obtainable for critical applications.
  Frequency stability: When applicable (high end RF) the lowest phase
         noise possible in the short term, long term consistent with
         accuracy and calibration intervals- better than 1
         ppm/year desirable.
  Frequency accuracy : Generally consistency across the system is
         more important than absolute accuracy. For calibration
         applications at least 1ppm.
  Uncalibrated time/time stability: Short term from fractional
         ms to ns or better. Long term comparable to GPS
         distributed time  .
  Uncalibrated time/time accuracy: Usually self-consistency
         requirements are tighter: ms to ns system wide.
         Absolute accuracy (traceable) is probably ms to 100 ns.
  Stabilization Time : Not usually important. Many times critical
         instruments themselves need minutes to hours to stabilize.
         However stabilization times greater than a few minutes will
         reduce the number of practical wide-area applications.
  Jitter on recovered timing signal: In the most critical applications,



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


         the lowest phase noise achievable, in terms of TIE less than
         the stability requirement.
  Wander on recovered timing signal: Modest for most measurements.
         For surveillance, long baseline, and similar less than the
         required stability over the duration of the test.
  What expected network characteristics (WAN, LAN, MAN, private, public,
         etc)?: Most are private or enterprise LAN. Large scale
         applications will benefit from using the public
         telecommunications networks.
  Does the application require security? (if so, which one:
         authentication, encryption, traceability, others): To date
         timing security requirements have been rare with the possible
         exception of measurement systems with legal requirements.
         Data security is more important when the public networks
         are involved.
  Reliability requirements (e.g. fault tolerance): Has not been an
         issue to date in most systems.
  Traceability to a specific clock, clock quality, path, time:
         Traceability to a path means that if there is on-path support
         we want to trace the path. Can also help to avoid time loops.
         Traceability is needed to establish NIST traceability. T&M will
         expect that public networks solve the timing loop problem. T&M
         end systems are typically strictly hierarchical networks without
         multiple paths.
  Holdover requirement: Has not been an issue to date- but as T&M
         increasingly is integrated into operational systems it will
         become more important. Telecom requirements are probably
         sufficient.
  Cost (consumer, enterprise, carrier): In most T&M systems component
         cost is very important. In many, operational cost is important.
  Auto-configuration (plug and play): Very important. T&M customers to
         date would prefer to avoid any network related configuration.
  Manageability (how much effort the operator needs to put in to manage
         this application?) - In-band or out-of-band of protocol
         (MIBs?): As little as possible operator interaction. However
         visibility into system performance, including timing, is
         very important both operationally and during debug and
         commissioning.
  Scale and scalability: T&M systems range from small systems with
         perhaps 2 or 3 instruments to large scale data acquisition
         with thousands of end devices. The physical scale of T&M
         systems varies widely from a few instruments on a
         bench to a few instruments separated by miles, and from
         several thousand instruments and sensors concentrated
         on a local device such as a jet engine to several thousand
         spread over many miles in environmental monitoring, or
         monitoring the telecommunications system. In all cases
         it is very common for these systems to grow as



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


         additional test requirements are imposed so scalability is
         important.

3.4.  Industrial Automation

   In the industrial sector there is a desire to move from special
   purpose communications infrastructure with calibrated wiring run back
   to a centralize controller, to a distributed system.  One example of
   this tendency is described below.

   In the printing industry there is a need to control operations in
   multi-stand printing machines.  The paper travels through these
   machines at a speed of nearly 100 km/h.  At these speeds, co-
   ordination error of 1 microsecond between operations taking place at
   different positions in the machine produces a 0.03mm color offset,
   which is visible to the naked eye and results in an unacceptable
   degradation in quality.

3.4.1.  Industrial Automation Requirements

   The requirements for the Industrial Automation are summarized as
   follows.


  Synchronization Type (e.g. time, frequency or phase):
  Frequency stability:
  Frequency accuracy :
  Uncalibrated time/time stability:

3.5.  ToD/ Internet

   General time distribution over the Internet or IP networks, is often
   called Time of Day or Wall-clock.  Most existing use cases are using
   NTP over the Internet with low precision requirements.  However, new
   applications are arising that require higher precision rates than
   what is currently available.

   Internet TOD is important to the maintenance of IT infrastructure in
   an organization.  Generally the larger an organization becomes, the
   more important time synchronization is.  Time synchronization is
   critical for the following: 1.  Server and router log file entry time
   tags 2.  "Date modified" attributes for files 3.  Chron job
   scheduling 4.  Security protocol with limited time windows for key
   exchange.

   Server and Router log file time tag accuracy is essential to network
   diagnostic tools.  Such tools are used to determine the root cause of
   a network failure or security breach.  Often it is important to
   determine the order in which certain events occur amongst a number of
   network devices.  The "Date modified" fields of files may also be
   part of this type of analysis.

   Often Chron jobs perform operations on files depending on the times
   in the "Date modified" attributes files.  These files might reside on
   more than one computer or server.

   Many security protocols, such as Kerberos, depend on authentication
   "tickets" which expire after a short time.  This means that an
   authenticating server gives a ticket to a client, which the client
   can send to another server for some service which requires
   authentication.  The time limit is intended to reduce the threat of
   the "Man in the middle attack."  To work the two servers need to have
   clocks synchronized to a time error which is smaller than the ticket
   time out period.  To increase security there is a desire to reduce
   the ticket time interval.  As the time interval becomes shorter the
   need for server clock agreement is increased.  The trend over time is
   to reduce the ticket time out period.

3.5.1.  ToD/Internet Requirements

   The requirements for the ToD/Internet are summarized as follows:

  Jitter on recovered timing signal: 100 ms
  Wander on recovered timing signal: 10 ms
  What expected network characteristics (WAN, LAN, MAN, private, public,
         etc)?: All network types
  Does the application require security? (if so, which one:
         authentication, encryption, traceability, others): Authentication
         sometimes used
  Reliability requirements (e.g. fault tolerance): high availability.
         Clients must see multiple servers
  Traceability to a specific clock, clock quality, path, time:
         Not important
  Holdover requirement: 1 hour to 1 year.  Depends on server redundancy
         architecture
  Cost (consumer, enterprise, carrier): 0 - $10,000 USD (1)
  Auto-configuration (plug and play):
  Manageability (how much effort the operator needs to put in to manage
         this application?) - In-band or out-of-band of protocol (MIBs?):
         30-90 minutes to configure a new server, 5 minutes to configure
         a new client.  Almost no management after initial deployment.
  Scale and scalability: system must cover entire IT infrastructure of
         organization. Any 1 server will cover 1 building or campus.

   (1) The free option implies pointing all clients at ntp servers
   available on the public internet.

3.7.  Legal Uses of Time

   With legal uses of time is meant the cases where high precision wall-
   clock is needed, just as in the ToD case, but with where the time
   source is traceable to UTC in a secure manner, i.e. through a
   certificate chain.  It's also important for the legal-time case that
   the certificate chain is set-up so that it provides for an audit
   trail, where the ToD provided at any given moment can be traced to a
   known source or standard (i.e. a national timescale or time
   laboratory).  One typical application that would benefit from high
   accuracy legal time is event correlation in computer systems logs,
   and similar applications.

3.7.1.  Legal Uses of Time Requirements

   There are timing applications for which accuracy and other
   characteristics are legally mandated, such as:

   o  Pay-by-time services (e.g., parking meters, taxicab meters, coin-
      operated laundries),

   o  First-arrival succeeds applications (e.g., races, stock-market
      exchanges),

   o  Devices that require accurate frequency for calibration (e.g.,
      police radar, RF broadcast).

   For such applications the legal requirements usually dictate both
   precision and accuracy, and frequently also traceability and security
   considerations.  There also may be requirements for keeping of logs
   for some amount of time, for certification of correct operation by
   qualified personnel, and specification of the national timing
   standard to be used.

   Due to the large number of disparate applications covered by legal
   uses of time, it is not useful to attempt to codify all the possible
   requirements in a table, however, the following is a typical subset
   of requirements.

 Synchronization Type (e.g. time, frequency or phase):  usually time,
        some frequency
 Frequency stability:
 Frequency accuracy : 100 ppm
 Uncalibrated time/time stability:
 Uncalibrated time/time accuracy: from 10s of ms to better than 1 second
 Stabilization Time :
 Jitter on recovered timing signal:
 Wander on recovered timing signal:
 What expected network characteristics (WAN, LAN, MAN, private, public,
        etc)?: private well-engineered IP networks, public Internet
 Does the application require security? (if so, which one: definitely
        authentication, encryption, traceability, others):
 Reliability requirements (e.g. fault tolerance): Yes, but not always
        specified
 Traceability to a specific clock, clock quality, path, time: to national
        standard
 Holdover requirement:
 Cost (consumer, enterprise, carrier):
 Auto-configuration (plug and play):
 Manageability (how much effort the operator needs to put in to manage
        this application?) - In-band or out-of-band of protocol (MIBs?):
 Scale and scalability: usually not an issue

3.8.  Metrology

   Metrology for time and frequency is today mostly using tailored
   equipment and cabling for time/frequency transfer when doing
   laboratory work.  However, in the future, using IP over existing
   networks in the laboratories would allow for greater flexibility and
   reuse of existing infrastructure rather than building out more
   special purpose infrastructure.

3.8.1.  Metrology Requirements

   We should distinguish between "primary" metrology of time and
   frequency performed in national metrology laboratories and some other
   timing centers (which deals with highly accurate and stable frequency
   standards, typically cesium standards and hydrogen masers and which
   ensures synchronization with a nanosecond accuracy) and applied
   metrology that mainly calibrates oscillators and clocks used as
   "secondary" standards in research organizations and industry.  The
   use of time and frequency transfer in packet networks is limited in
   "primary" metrology, as it operates with frequency accuracy and
   stability in the order of 1e-14 and better and time accuracy in
   nanoseconds (1 ns represents 1 foot of the light path in vacuum).  In
   turn, time and frequency transfer through packet networks is quite
   challenging for applied metrology - it can profit from any



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


   improvement of transfer accuracy, therefore the values in table 8
   should be considered as minimum target values.  Whenever possible,
   accuracy of distributed time should be better then time accuracy
   provided by a GPS receiver.  Short distance application (over LAN)
   usually require better accuracy than long distance application using
   WAN.

   Note: some applications might belong into both metrology and
   measurement application groups.

   The requirements for the Metrology are summarized as follows:


    Synchronization Type (e.g. time, frequency or phase):  Time and
           frequency
    Frequency stability: 1 ppb, lowest possible phase noise
    Frequency accuracy : 1 ppb
    Uncalibrated time/time stability: Lowest possible phase noise
    Uncalibrated time/time accuracy: 1 us
    Stabilization Time : Not important, 1 hour is acceptable
    Jitter on recovered timing signal: 1 us
    Wander on recovered timing signal: 1 us
    What expected network characteristics (WAN, LAN, MAN, private,
           public, etc)?: Any that can offer required parameters
    Does the application require security? (if so, which one:
           authentication, encryption, traceability, others):
           Authentication is required when public networks are used
    Reliability requirements (e.g. fault tolerance): Low fault
           tolerance,  user should know whether expected parameters
           were assured or not
    Traceability to a specific clock, clock quality, path, time: Very
           important
    Holdover requirement:
    Cost (consumer, enterprise, carrier): Cost should correspond with
           provided parameters
    Auto-configuration (plug and play): Important at client side
    Manageability (how much effort the operator needs to put in to
           manage this application?) - In-band or out-of-band of
           protocol (MIBs?): Both provider and customer should accept
           network related configuration, long distribution path might
           require calibration
    Scale and scalability:

3.9.  Sensor Networks

   More generally, there is growing interest in clock synchronization in
   massively parallel sensor networks.  Advances in wireless
   communications have enabled the development of low power miniature

   sensors that collect and disseminate data from their immediate
   environment.  Although each sensor has limited processing power,
   through distributed processing the network becomes capable of
   performing various tasks of data fusion, but only assuming a common
   time base can be established.

3.9.1.  Sensors Networks Requirements

   The requirements for the Sensor are summarized as follows.


 Synchronization Type (e.g. time, frequency or phase): time
 Frequency stability: 1%
 Frequency accuracy : 1000ppm
 Uncalibrated time/time stability: 1 part per hundred
 Uncalibrated time/time accuracy: 1 second
 Stabilization Time : intermediate
 Jitter on recovered timing signal: several seconds up to 1 milliHz
 Wander on recovered timing signal: less than one second above 1 milliHz
 What expected network characteristics (WAN, LAN, MAN, private, public,
        etc)?: distributed hop-to-hop network
 Does the application require security? (if so, which one:
        authentication, encryption, traceability, others): authentication,
        encryption
 Reliability requirements (e.g. fault tolerance): intermediate
 Traceability to a specific clock, clock quality, path, time: one master
 Holdover requirement: 1% wander per 10 days
 Cost (consumer, enterprise, carrier): depends on application, from very
        low to intermediate
 Auto-configuration (plug and play): strong requirement as there are
        many sensors
 Manageability (how much effort the operator needs to put in to manage
        this application?) - In-band or out-of-band of protocol
        (MIBs?): in-band, self organizing, little to no storage on device
 Scale and scalability:  must scale to 1000s of intercommunicating sensors


4.  Network Dependencies

   When using packet networks to transfer timing, packet delay
   variation, propagation asymmetry, and maximum permissible packet rate
   all have a significant bearing on the accuracy with which the client
   is able to determine absolute time.  Thus the network environment has
   a large bearing on the quality of time that can be delivered.

   Timing distribution is highly sensitive to packet delay variation,
   and thus can deteriorate under congestion conditions.  Furthermore
   the disciplining of the client's oscillator (the sole component of

   frequency transfer, and a critical component of time transfer) is a
   function that should not be disrupted.  When the service is disrupted
   the client needs to go into "holdover" mode, and its accuracy will
   consequently be degraded.  Depending on the relative quality of the
   client's clock and the required quality after disciplining, a
   relatively high packet rate may be required.

   Packet delay variation can to some extent be addressed by traffic
   engineering, thus time transfer within a constrained network
   environment might reasonably be expected to deliver a higher quality
   time service than can be achieved between two arbitrary hosts
   connected to the Internet.  Greater gains can probably be obtained by
   deploying equipment that incorporates IEEE 1588 style on-the-fly
   packet timestamp correction (or any other form of on-path support),
   or follow-up message mechanisms that report the packet storage and
   forward delays to the client.  However one can only be sure that such
   techniques are available along the entire path in a well-controlled
   environment.  Therefore, time transfer protocols should not assume
   the availability of on path support, but utilizes it where available.

   The packet rate between the time-server and its client also has a
   bearing on the quality of the time transfer, because at a higher rate
   the smart filter has a better chance of extracting the "good"
   packets.  How the packet rate relates to the accuracy is dependent on
   the filter algorithm in use.  In a controlled environment it is
   possible to ensure that there is adequate bandwidth, and that the
   server is not overloaded.  In such an environment the onus moves from
   protecting the server from overload, to ensuring that the server can
   satisfy the needs of all of the clients.

   Congested and overloaded paths might influence the quality of timing
   transfer.  In a constrained network environment, it's assumed that a
   service provider will ensure that packet delivery is done in
   according to the timing transfer needs of the network operator.

6.  Security Considerations

   Time and frequency services are a significant element of network
   infrastructure, and are critical for certain emerging applications.
   Hence time and frequency transfer services MUST be protected from
   being compromised, and for some of the applications described above
   such as legal time, the ability to provide and audit trail to the

   timing source.  One possible threat is a false time or frequency
   server being accepted instead of a true one, thus enabling an
   attacker to alter the time and frequency service provided.  Other
   possible scenarios are to be able to distinguish between trusted
   clients and non-trusted clients when providing service.

   Any protection mechanism must be designed in such a way that it does
   not degrade the quality of the time transfer.  Such a mechanism
   SHOULD also be relatively lightweight, as client restrictions often
   dictate a low processing and memory footprint, and because the server
   may have extensive fan-out.

   The following authentication mechanisms need to be considered:

   1.  of server by client (depending on the application)

   2.  of client by server (depending on the application)

   3.  transactions (depending on the application)

Appendix A.  Existing Time and Frequency Transfer Mechanisms

   In this section we will discuss existing mechanisms for transfer of
   time information, frequency information, or both.  It should be noted
   that a sufficiently accurate time transfer service may be used to
   derive an accurate frequency transfer.  Indeed, this is exactly what
   happens in a GPS disciplined frequency standard.  On the other hand,
   an accurate frequency transfer service, while itself unable to
   transfer absolute time, is usually used to support and improve the
   performance of the time transfer service.  Indeed, implementations of
   NTP or IEEE 1588 clients can be considered to consist of two phases.
   First, a local oscillator is locked to the server's frequency using
   incoming information from the incoming packets, and then the local
   time set based on the server's time and the propagation latency.  By
   maintaining a local frequency source, the client requires relatively
   infrequent updates, and can continue functioning during short periods
   of network outage.  Moreover, it can be shown that this method
   results in significantly better time transfer accuracy than methods
   that do not discipline a local clock.

   Time transfer mechanisms can be divided into three classes.  The

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


   first class consists of mechanisms that use radio frequency
   transport, while the second mechanism uses dedicated "wires" (which
   for our purposes include optical fibers).  The third, which will be
   our main focus, exploits a Packet Switched Network for transfer of
   timing information.  Advantages and disadvantages of these three
   methods are discussed in the following subsections.

A.1.  Radio-based Timing Transfer Methods

   The transfer of time by radio transmission is one of the oldest
   methods available, and is still the most accurate wide area method.
   In particular, there are two navigation systems in wide use that can
   be used for time transfer, The LOng RAnge Navigation (LORAN)
   terrestrial radio system, and the Global Navigation Satellite System
   (GNSS).  In both cases the user needs to be able to receive the
   transmitted signal, requiring access to a suitable antenna.  In
   certain situations, e.g. basement communications rooms and urban
   canyons, the required signal may not be receivable.

   Radio systems have high accuracy, far better than what we will later
   see can be achieved by existing PSN technologies.  However coverage
   is limited; eLORAN for example only covers North America, and GPS
   does not have good coverage near the poles.

   Although civilian use is sanctioned, the GPS was developed and is
   operated by the U.S. Department of Defense as a military system.  For
   this reason there are political concerns that rules out its use in
   certain countries.  The European Union is working on an alternative
   system called Galileo, which will be run as a commercial enterprise.
   In addition, GPS has some well-documented multi-hour outages, and is
   considered vulnerable to jamming.  One major PTT also reports that
   they see a 2% per year failure rate for the antenna/receiver/
   clock-out chain.

   While a radio-based timing service may be acceptable for some sites,
   it is frequently impractical to use on a per equipment basis.  Hence,
   some form of local timing distribution is usually also required.

A.2.  Dedicated Wire-based Timing Transfer Methods

   The use of dedicated networks in the wide area does not scale well.
   Such services were available in the past, but for reasons of cost and
   accuracy have been superseded by GPS based solutions.

   In the local area, one new technique is emerging as a mechanism for
   time transport, namely DOCSIS Timing Interface(DTI).  DTI was
   designed by DOCSIS for the distribution of time in a cable head-end
   in support of media access control.  Time transfer is packet-based



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


   over a multi-stage hub and spoke dedicated network.  It uses a single
   twisted-pair in half-duplex to eliminate inaccuracies due to the
   length differences between the pairs in a multi-pair cable.

   The DTI approach is applicable for special applications, but the need
   for a dedicated network imposes significant drawbacks for the general
   time transfer case.

   Synchronous Ethernet is a technique that has recently been approved
   by ITU-T, it provides frequency distribution over Ethernet links.
   Modern dedicated-media full-duplex Ethernet, in both copper and
   optical physical layer variants, transmits continuously.  One can
   thus elect to derive the physical layer transmitter clock from a high
   quality frequency reference, instead of the conventional 100 ppm
   crystal-derived transmitter rate.  The receiver at the other end of
   the link automatically locks onto the physical layer clock of the
   received signal, and thus itself gain access to a highly accurate and
   stable frequency reference.  Then, in TDM fashion, this receiver
   could lock the transmission clock of its other ports to this
   frequency reference.  Apart from some necessary higher layer packet
   based configuration and OAM operations to transport synchronization
   status messaging, the solution is entirely physical layer, and has no
   impact on higher layers.

   At first sight it would seem that the only application of Synchronous
   Ethernet was in frequency transfer (it has no intrinsic time transfer
   mechanism).  However, the quality of packet-based time transfer
   mechanism can be considerably enhanced if used in conjunction with
   Synchronous Ethernet as a frequency reference.

A.3.  Transfer Using Packet Networks

   When using a PSN to transfer timing, a server sends timing
   information in the form of packets to one or multiple clients.  When
   there are multiple clients, the timing packets may be multicast.
   Software/hardware in the client recovers the frequency and/or time of
   the server based on the packet arrival time and the packet contents.

   There are two well-known protocols capable of running over a general-
   purpose packet network, NTP [RFC1305], and IEEE 1588 [1588].  NTP is
   the product of the IETF, and is currently undergoing revision to
   version 4.  PTP (a product of the IEEE Test and Measurement
   community) is specified in a limited first version (1588-2002), and
   the second version (1588-2008)was approved recently.

   It is important that NTP, IEEE-1588 or any other future packet based
   time transfer mechanism do not break each other if they run in the
   same network.

A.3.1.  NTP summary description

   NTP is widely deployed, but existing implementations deliver accuracy
   on the order of 10 milliseconds.  This accuracy is not adequate for
   the applications described above.  Current NTP suffers from the fact
   that it was designed to operate over the Internet, and the routers
   and switches make no special concessions to NTP for preservation of
   time transfer accuracy.  Furthermore, typical update rates are low
   and can not be significantly increased due to scalability issues in
   the server.  In addition most NTP time servers and time receivers
   have a relatively unsophisticated implementation that further
   degrades the final time quality.  However, proprietary NTP
   implementations that use other algorithms and update-rates have
   proved that NTP packet formats can be used for higher accuracy.

A.3.2.  IEEE1588 summary description

   The information exchange component of IEEE 1588 is a protocol known
   as Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  PTP version 1 (1588-2002) was a
   time transfer protocol that exclusively used multicast technique and
   it was primarily developed for Industrial Automation and Test and
   Measurement applications.  It is widely anticipated that wide scale
   deployment of PTP will be based on PTP version 2 (1588-2008).

   IEEE Std 1588-2008 can be considered to consist of several
   components:

   1.  A configuration and control protocol

   2.  A time transfer protocol

   3.  A time correction protocol

   4.  Physical mapping

   The configuration and control protocol is based on the multicast
   approach of IEEE Std 1588-2002 (multicast IP with recommended TTL=1,
   UDP, PTP payload with equipment identifier in the payload).  The
   rationale for this approach was that the equipment needed to be "plug
   and play" (no configuration), was required to map to physical media
   other than Ethernet, and had to have a very low memory and processor
   footprint.  IEEE Std 1588-2008 includes Unicast messages.

   The time transfer protocol is a standard two-way time transfer
   approach used in other packet-based approaches.  Like all such
   approaches it is subject to inaccuracies due to variable store and
   forward delays in the packet switches, and due to the assumption of
   symmetric propagation delays.  For IEEE Std 1588-2008, the time



Rodrigues, et al.       Expires September 5, 2011              [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                       March 2011


   transfer packets (in both directions) may be operated in a multicast
   or unicast mode.

   The time correction protocol is used to correct for propagation,
   store and forward delays in the packet switches.  This again may be
   operated multicast or unicast.  This mechanism requires some level of
   hop-by-hop hardware support.  This mechanism may also be considered a
   concept in its own right and may be adapted to enhance other packet
   time transfer protocols such as NTP.

   The IEEE Std 1588-2008 specification describes how the PTP operates
   over the Ethernet/IP/UDP protocol stack.  It includes annexes that
   describe PTP operation over pure layer 2 Ethernet, and over a number
   of specialist media.

   The mappings of interest for telecommunications are PTP over UDP/IP,
   PTP over MPLS , and perhaps PTP over Ethernet.  They may operate in
   unicast or multicast.  Issues of a suitable control management and
   OAM environment for these applications are largely in abeyance, as
   are considerations about the exact nature of the network environment.

   It is also worth noting the existence of a second IEEE effort, IEEE
   802.1AS.  This group is specifying the protocol and procedures to
   ensure synchronization across Bridged and Virtual Bridged Local Area
   Networks for time sensitive applications such as audio and video.
   For these LAN media the transmission delays are assumed to be fixed
   and symmetrical.  IEEE 802.1AS specifies the use of IEEE 1588
   specifications where applicable in the context of IEEE Standards
   802.1D and 802.1Q. Synchronization to an externally provided timing
   signal (e.g., a recognized timing standard such as UTC or TAI) is not
   part of this standard but is not precluded.  IEEE 802.1AS will
   specify how stations attached to bridged LANs to meet the respective
   jitter, wander, and time synchronization requirements for time-
   sensitive applications.


Appendix B.  Other Forums Working in this Problem Space

   The NTP WG is the IETF group working on time distribution, but is
   presently only documenting NTPv4 and is not working on new algorithms
   or protocols.  It is expected that many participants of the NTP WG
   will participate in the TICTOC effort.

   The PWE3 WG has discussed frequency distribution for the TDM PW
   application, however it is not chartered to develop protocols for
   this purpose.  It is expected that participants of the PWE3 WG who
   were active in the TDM PW discussions will participate in the TICTOC
   effort.

   The IEEE approved the version 2 of the IEEE 1588 protocol (IEEE Std
   1588- 2008) that will run over more types of PSNs.  The protocol to
   be specified contains elements that will be of use in an IETF
   environment, but is unlikely to be regarded as being a complete,
   robust solution in such an environment.  If the IEEE 1588 structure
   is deemed to be a suitable platform, then the IETF could contribute
   an Internet profile, including a complete distributed systems
   environment suitable for our purposes.  Alternatively, the IETF could
   perhaps borrow some of the delay correction mechanisms and
   incorporate them into a development of a new version of NTP.

   In addition, IEEE 802.1AS is working on Timing and Synchronization
   for Time-Sensitive Applications in Bridged Local Area Networks,
   basing itself on the IEEE 1588 standard.

   ITU-T SG15 Question 13 has produced Recommendation G.8261 "Timing and
   synchronization aspects in packet networks" [G8261].  This
   Recommendation defines requirements for various scenarios, outlines
   the functionality of frequency distribution elements, and provides
   measurement guidelines.  It does not specify algorithms to be used
   for attaining the performance needed.  ITU-T has also consented
   G.8262 "Timing Characteristics of Synchronous Ethernet Equipment
   Slave Clock (EEC)" [G8262], and G.8264 "Distribution of timing
   through packet networks" [G8264].  G.8262 specifies the requirements
   for Synchronous Ethernet clocks and G.8264 defines the protocol for
   Synchronization Status Message (SSM) for Synchronous Ethernet.  To
   date the ITU-T has focused on Ethernet infrastructure, but this is
   likely to extend to an MPLS environment.  Two new work items,
   G.paclock.bis and G.pacmod.bis extend the work, and in particular,
   G.pacmod.bis intends to introduce time transfer.  The scope for
   G.paclock.bis is to define the requirements for packet-based clocks.
   This is an area where the IETF, with its expertise in IP and MPLS
   networks, may co-operate with the ITU.
