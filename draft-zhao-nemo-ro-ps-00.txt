1.  Introduction

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC2119 [7].

   NEMO Basic Support protocol maintains the connectivity when MR
   changes its point of attachment to the Internet by establishing a bi-
   directional tunnel between MR and HA.  Like MIP6, the protocol
   specification introduces one level of indirection in the routing
   system in favor of protocol simplicity and minimal changes on fixed
   nodes.  However, it results in a non-optimal (We will define
   "optimal" and "non-optimal" later.) route between MNN and CN with a
   non-zero and even very large probability, which causes the
   significant communication delay.  Moreover, by using IPv6 header
   encapsulation together with other options, NEMO Basic Support
   protocol also causes big overheads in packet payload and bandwidth.
   NEMO RO problem introduces more challenges and more difficulties than
   MIP6 RO problem because of the nested NEMO network where multiple
   levels of mobility are formed.  Without NEMO RO solution, the
   performance becomes much worse especially in the nested NEMO.

   In this draft, we describe and analyze the routing optimization
   problem in NEMO, defines the requirements that must be met by NEMO
   route optimization solutions and then describes the metrics to
   evaluate the performance of NEMO route optimization solutions.

2.  Terminology

   The terms used in this draft are defined in [2], besides the
   following ones:

      Correspondent Agent (CA): An entity (router or host) performs the
      RO function with MR on behalf of CN.  In NEMO when MR acts as a
      gateway and performs RO function for an entire mobile network
      associated with itself, its peer is CA rather than CN that is
      instead the peer of MNN from an end-to-end perspective.  CA may be
      just CN itself or a router near CN or even CN's default router.
      One MR could have multiple CAs at the same time because MNNs
      behind this MR may communicate with CNs in the different networks.
      And in NEMO Basic Support protocol, HA acts as CA for any node in
      the Internet to communicate with MNN behind its MR.

      Anchor point: the entity that knows the binding information
      between host and location and thus is capable of forwarding the
      data packets destined for a host to the location directly.  In the
      fixed network, each router is such kind of anchor point because IP
      address represents both location and host, and the destination IP
      address together with the routing table provides the sufficient
      knowledge on how to reach the destination.  However in the NEMO
      mobile network that is compliant with NEMO Basic Support protocol,
      HA is the only anchor point for CN and MNN.  In order to achieve
      the optimal route in NEMO, MR and CA should become anchor point
      too.  In most cases, the closer to MNN/CN the anchor point is, the
      shorter the routing path is.

      Inbound direction: The direction from the Internet infrastructure
      to the inside of NEMO network.

      Outbound direction: The direction from the inside of NEMO network
      to the Internet infrastructure.

      Inbound route : The route taken by the packets forwarded in the
      inbound direction.  Inbound route is used exchangeably with
      inbound path.

      Outbound route : The route taken by the packets forwarded in the
      outbound direction.  Outbound route is used exchangeably with
      outbound path.

3.  Assumptions

   In this draft we do not consider the case of mobile HA.  Instead we
   assume that all HAs are fixed nodes and are located in the Internet
   infrastructure.  Firstly it is not clear yet about the need of mobile
   HA in the real life at this moment.  Secondly and more importantly,
   since a mobile HA needs the help of another fixed HA in order to
   forward the traffic for MRs, the mobile HA case can be deduced into
   the similar case with only fixed HA.  Our description has no
   difficulty to be extended into the mobile HA case.  Thus we believe
   that this assumption is reasonable and does not prevent the thorough
   analysis on NEMO RO problem.

4.  The definition of "optimal" and "non-optimal" route

   NEMO route optimization solution aims to provide the optimal route
   between MNN and CN as well as between MR and CA.  As it has been
   understood for a long time that the routing path in the Internet is
   asymmetric, in the following text we consider just either of two
   directions without explicit statement and the same analyses also
   apply to the other direction.

4.1  Optimal route

   In the NEMO Route Optimization problem, "optimal route" is not the
   topologically shortest path or the best route in terms of any other
   metric from source to destination.  Based on the location of CN,
   "optimal route" is discussed in the following cases:

4.1.1  CN is not under the same nested NEMO as its peer, MNN

   CN may be located in either fixed or mobile network.  As the route
   between MNN/MR and CN/CA consists of two portions, the route in the
   Internet and the route inside the (nested) NEMO network, we define
   them separately.  The "optimal route" in the Internet is the route
   between the location of MNN/MR and the location of CN/CA based on the
   forwarding tables of Internet routers, which is usually built by
   inter-domain or intra-domain routing protocol.  Precisely, location
   is the point of attachment to the Internet.  While in MIP6 MN's
   Care-of-Address represents its location of attachment to the
   Internet, in the nested NEMO MNN/MR's Care-of-Address is not
   sufficient any more to represent its location of attachment to the
   Internet except the case of root-MR; Instead it represents the point
   of attachment to the parent MR or the location inside the parent
   NEMO.  A sequence of Care-of-Addresses of MRs or other ways may be
   used to represent the location of MR in the NEMO RO solution.

   The "optimal route" inside the NEMO network is formed by the decision
   of each MR along the outbound and inbound path.  In the outbound
   direction, MR just forwards the packets to its default router that is
   determined when MR associates to NEMO network while in the inbound
   direction, MR forwards the packets to the next hop depending on the
   solution.  The inbound path inside the NEMO network may be different
   from the outbound path.  Note that the route inside the NEMO network
   does not contain HA.

4.1.2  CN is under the same nested NEMO as its peer, MNN

   CN may be under the same MR or different MR from its peer.  We assume
   that node1 wants to communicate with node2 under the same nested
   NEMO.  Path p1 = <MR_(1,1), MR_(1,2), ..., MR_(1,m)> is the sequence

Internet-Draft              NEMO RO Problem                 October 2004


   of routers inside the nested NEMO for node1 to reach node2 and path
   p2 = <MR_(2,1), MR_(2,2), ..., MR_(2,n)> is the sequence of routers
   inside the nested NEMO for node2 to reach node1.

   Case 1: If the intersection of p1 and p2 is not empty, denoted by
   <MR_(1,i1), MR_(1,i2), ..., MR_(1,ik)> = <MR_(2,j1), MR_(2,j2), ...,
   MR_(2,jk)> where i1 < i2 < ...  < ik and j1 < j2 < ...  < jk, then
   ideally the optimal path between node1 and node2 is <MR_(1,1),
   MR_(1,2), ..., MR_(1,i1), MR_(2,j1-1), ..., MR_2,2, MR_2,1>.  Note
   that MR_(1,i1) is equal to MR_(2,j1).

                           |---| MR2 |---| MR3 |--LFN3

                           |---| MR4 |---| MR5 |--LFN5
                               |-----|   |-----|


           Figure 1: The optimal route inside the nested NEMO

   For example, in the nested NEMO shown by Figure 1, the optimal route
   between LFN3 and LFN5 is MR3<->MR2<->MR1<->MR4<->MR5.

   The optimal route in this case is the route turning around at the
   first MR that is aware of how to forward the data packets from source
   to destination without going out of the nested NEMO.  However, in
   NEMO Basic Support protocol, the data packet takes a route that goes
   out of the nested NEMO and comes back to the same nested NEMO again.

   Case 2: If the intersection of p1 and p2 is empty (It may be due to
   multiple different root-MRs and no inter-communication between them),
   the "optimal route" inside the nested NEMO consists of both p1 and
   p2, and the "optimal route" inside the Internet follows the
   definition in Section 4.1.1.

4.2  Non-optimal route

   In NEMO Basic Support protocol, the packets are forwarded to an
   intermediate box, HA, in both directions rather than the location of
   destination directly, which results in a longer route than the
   "optimal route" with a high probability.  We refer this kind of route
   as "non-optimal" route.  Worse than MIP6, in the nested NEMO network
   the packets are forwarded to multiple HAs in both directions before
   arriving at the location of destination.  [10] describes the

   non-optimal route that packets would take using existing Mobile IPv6
   and NEMO Basic Support mechanisms

4.3  Approximately optimal route

   The solution to achieve an "optimal route" has to consider a lot of
   other factors, for example, scalability, efficiency, and security, to
   name a few.  Although the solution may result in an approximately
   optimal route, it must be the best overall when all the related
   issues are taken into consideration.

5.  Limitation of NEMO Basic Support protocol

   In this section, we analyze the limitation of NEMO Basic Support
   protocol and the reasons to cause the non-optimal route.

5.1  Reverse tunneling

   In NEMO Basic Support protocol, all the packets forwarded by MR in
   the outbound direction have to go through HA firstly.  If the reverse
   tunnel would be removed in NEMO RO solution, it is equivalent to the
   case where MR is the anchor point for the outbound packet.

   Instead in the normal fixed network, the data packets are sent to the
   destination directly.

5.2  HA as the only anchor point

   Since MR is refrained from announcing its MNP to the infrastructure
   due to the conflicts and routing instability issues, HA is the only
   anchor point for MNN as well as CN and thus the packets destined to
   MNNs can be served only by HA.  Even worse in the nested NEMO, the
   packets inevitably have to go through multiple HAs in order to be
   forwarded to MNN correctly.

   The non-optimal route is formed because the binding information is
   available in HA only and the HA's location is limited in home network
   only.  Image that there are as many HAs as routers scattering around
   the Internet, every data packet from CN is forwarded by a nearby HA
   and takes at least a nearly optimal route.  Deploying multiple HAs in
   the different domains or spreading binding information needs to
   consider a lot of issues, such as fundamental changes, conflict and
   scalability etc.

   Compared with the fixed network, there is no limitation on the
   location of anchor point because each router is such an anchor point.

5.3  Inside the nested NEMO

   If MR inside the nested NEMO is refrained from announcing its MNP to
   other MRs, MR does not know how to forward in the inbound direction
   just based on the destination IP address and its own limited
   knowledge of topology.  Thus MR has to depend on the explicit
   IP-in-IP header to forward to the next hop, which in return requires
   that each data packet should go through HA.

5.4  Data plane based method

   We categorize NEMO as a data plane method because 1) there is no



Zhao, et al.             Expires April 18, 2005                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              NEMO RO Problem                 October 2004


   signaling message introduced for CN to discover or update the binding
   information; 2) many changes are made in order for the routing
   decision to be explicitly carried in the data packet in an "in-band"
   fashion.  The limitation of this data plane method is that every data
   packet has to experience the non-optimal route even though the
   optimal route may be existing and fairly stable within a certain time
   window.  Considering the potential large number of data packets, the
   inefficiency as well as the benefits if the problem is solved are
   very big.

   On the other hand this method avoids the large change on the
   infrastructure.	Given the fact that a big change on the
   infrastructure may take a longer time to deploy, a RO solution in
   data plane may qualify as a necessary step before a revolutionary
   change happens.

5.5  Data packet and processing overhead

   Encapsulation and other options in IPv6 header cause the overhead in
   data packet and bandwidth, packet fragmentation, and the processing
   overhead in MR and HA especially in the nested NEMO where every level
   of mobility introduces one encapsulation together with applicable
   option fields into the data packet.

   In the fixed network, encapsulation and other options are not needed
   since all the routing decision is purely based on the forwarding
   table and the destination IP address.

5.6  Summary

   One significant difference between MIP6 and NEMO is the management
   granularity that is a single host in MIPv6 and a mobile network in
   NEMO.  Another significant difference is the multiple levels of
   mobility in the nested NEMO, which not only causes much longer
   routing path and bigger overhead in the data payload but also more
   challenges when attempting to solve NEMO RO problem, for example,
   given that any other factor is constant, the number of messages (RR
   test, BU etc) is in direct proportion to the number of MRs along the
   path if no cooperation among them.  In summary, NEMO RO problem is a
   challenging problem and requires a well-designed NEMO RO solution.

6.  The formalization of the nested NEMO network

   The topology of the nested NEMO can be formalized into graph.  When
   care is taken to avoid the loop to be formed, this graph is a
   Directed Acyclic Graph that may be also considered as a set of
   multiple overlapping trees.

   The inbound graph is a direct graph <V, E> where each node in V
   denotes a MR and if one of egress interfaces in MRj gets its
   care-of-address from one MNP owned by MRi, the link from MRi to MRj,
   <MRi, MRj> belongs to the edge set E.

   The outbound graph is a direct graph <V, E> where each node in V
   denotes a MR and if MRj chooses MRi as its default router, the link
   from MRj to MRi, <MRj, MRi> belongs to the edge set E.

   This method can also formalize a multi-homing nested NEMO where there
   could be more than one egress interface associated with one MR and
   more than one MR owning one or more MNPs.  Figure 2 below shows an
   exmaple of nested NEMO network.

                           |-------|                  |-------|
                           |  MR1  |                  |  MR2  |
                           |-------|                  |-------|
                             |  |                         |
                        MNP1 |  | MNP2               MNP2 |
                    --?------+  +-------?------?----------+
                      |                 |      |
                      |                 |      |
                      |eth0|-------|eth1|      |eth0|-------|
                      |----|  MR3  |----|      |----|  MR4  |
                           |-------|                |-------|


   In this figure, MR1 announces MNP1 and MNP2 while MR2 announces MNP2.
   MR3 has two interfaces that associate with MR1 and MR2 respectively
   while MR4 associates with MR2 only.

   The inbound graph is shown in Figure 3.

   We can simplify the inbound graph shown in Figure 3 into the
   following one.

   Assume that MR3 chooses MR2 as the default router through eth1 and
   MR4 chooses MR1 as the default router through eth0.  The outbound

   The formalization may help us understand the problem better and
   develop the RO solution.  For example, if an explicit next hop
   address is presented in the packet, MR has to check whether this next
   hop address belongs to one of its MNPs in order to prevent an
   attacker forcing the packet to be forwarded in a loop.

7.  The related tradeoff

   We discuss the tradeoffs when designing the solution for NEMO RO
   problem.

7.1  Data plane method vs. signaling plane method

   Data plane method needs fewer changes but introduces more overheads
   while signaling plane method may require more changes on the
   protocols.  We need to consider how to utilize the advantages of both
   methods and avoid the disadvantages.

7.2  Optimization vs. the scalability issue in MR, CA and HA

   The closer to CN CA is, the more optimal route; but MR has to perform
   RO functions with more CAs when the number of different CNs is large
   and all CNs scatter around the Internet.  MR may choose not to
   perform RO function but NEMO Basic Support protocol due to the
   management cost.

   On the other hand, if there are many MRs belonging to the same home
   network scattering around the Internet, because of the same reason,
   CA may also choose to perform NEMO Basic Support protocol with HA
   rather than to perform RO function with each MR.

   If there are many HAs, each of which is close to each MR belonging to
   the same home network, the route between MNN and CN is at least
   nearly optimal.  Thus there is a tradeoff between the optimal route
   and the scalability issue in terms of the number of HAs.

7.3  Optimization vs. the scope of change

   The scope of change is in terms of the number of nodes that need to
   be changed in order to support NEMO RO solution.  If all CNs are
   changed to support the NEMO RO, the optimal route is formed; however,
   if the scope of change is a limited number of nodes, the probability
   that a sub-optimal route is formed could be very large.

7.4  Location privacy vs. optimal route

   Bi-direction tunnel in NEMO Basic Support protocol can maintain some
   level of location privacy.  A potential RO solution may require some
   location information to be revealed in order to facility route
   optimization.

7.5  Security vs. optimal route

   In NEMO Basic Support protocol, it is very possible that there pre-

   exists the security association between MR and HA, which helps resist
   the various attacks.  However in NMEO RO solution, as the MR-HA
   tunnel may not exist and there is no pre-existing security
   association between two entities from the different domains, it is
   more challenging to maintain the same security strength as in NEMO
   Basic Support protocol.

7.6  Scalability vs. reliability

   This is a general tradeoff in NEMO.  As MR manages a whole mobile
   network, when MR fails due to attack or error, a bunch of MNNs behind
   MR lose the connectivity even though any single MNN still functions
   well.  However, generally it provides more scalability than MIP6.

8.  The scope of NEMO RO problem

8.1  What NEMO RO considers

   (Below is an incomplete list of issues related to NEMO RO problem
   quoted from the NEMO mailing list.  More discussions are still
   needed.)

   o  NEMO The optimal route when two communicating nodes are located
      either in the same or different (nested) NEMO network [10].

   o  VMN may choose not to perform MIP6 RO solution so that even though
      MR performs NEMO RO function, the packets originated from and
      destined to VMN still have to go through VMN's HA.  We need to
      consider all the related issues if we want to remove this kind of
      sub-optimal route for VMN.

   o  Missing signaling messages when performing NEMO RO

   o  Obsolete state or signaling message when mobility causes the
      topology changes

   o  RO problem when multi-homing is also involved

   o  Data packet overhead when header encapsulation, options and
      routing header are used

   o  Security problem.

   o  Location privacy problem

   o  Looping problem

   o  Cross-over tunnel problem

   o  BU storm

8.2  What NEMO RO does not consider

   TBD.

9.  Requirements

   The goal of NEMO RO solution is to provide an optimal route between
   any two nodes regradless of the location, the configuration, and the
   type etc.  Besides those defined in [1], NEMO RO solution, hereafter
   referred to as "the solution", must meet the following requirements
   that are described in the descending order of importance as follows:

      R1: When any MR in NEMO performs NEMO RO function, the route taken
      by the traffic from this MR together with any MNN inside this MR's
      sub-NEMO MUST be better than the one resulted in by performing
      NEMO Basic Support protocol.

      R2: Signaling messages MUST be secured to guarantee the integrity,
      confidentiality, anti-replay and authorization.  The insider
      attack where the attacker is on the routing path SHOULD be at
      least detected while the outsider attack where the attacker is not
      on the routing path MUST be resisted.  The security mechanism MUST
      prevent the forged packet being forwarded in a loop inside NEMO
      and MUST not generate the new vulnerability.  Overall, the
      security level and the location privacy MUST be kept as strong as
      in NEMO Basic Support protocol.

      R3: This solution SHOULD introduce limited signaling overhead,
      limited packet payload overhead, limited memory cost needed for
      processing, limited complexity in term of data structure and
      protocol state machine transition.

      R4: The solution MUST be able to support a potentially large
      number of MNNs, CNs, CAs as well as HAs (if applicable) and
      arbitrary levels of MRs unless because of other constraints.

      R5: The solution SHOULD avoid too many changes on MNN/MR/CN/CA/HA
      unless the significant performance improvement can be achieved.
      It is desired to keep the mobility transparency for MNN behind MR.

      R6: The solution SHOULD be able to handle the topology changes in
      any kind of mobility pattern very well and minimize the impact of
      handover over applications, in term of packet loss or delay.

      R7: The solution SHOULD function for multi-homing NEMO networks
      (multiple MNPs, multiple MRs and multiple network interfaces,
      etc.).  The solution SHOULD not conflict with multi-homing
      mechanism, such as loading balance, fault tolerance etc.

      R8: Each MR can either independently decide whether to perform RO
      function or NEMO Basic Support protocol or collaborate with other
      MR based on its policy.  The decision made by one MR MUST not

Internet-Draft              NEMO RO Problem                 October 2004


      prevent other MR performing either NEMO RO or NEMO Basic Support
      protocol properly.

      R9: The solution SHOULD ensure backward compatibility with other
      standards defined by the IETF.  Especially the solution MUST not
      prevent the proper operation of Mobile IPv6 (i.e.  the solution
      MUST allow MIP6-enabled MNNs to operate either of the CN, HA, or
      MN operations defined in MIP6.) and NEMO Basic Support protocol.

      More?

10.  Evaluation Considerations

   The following metrics are defined to evaluate how good a NEMO RO
   solution is besides meeting the requirements described above.  Each
   metric may be assigned a weight in order to find a overall best RO
   solution.

   o  Level of compatibility with NEMO Basic Support protocol

   o  Complexity: How many changes to MNN/MR/CA/HA are introduced? Does
      the solution maintain the mobility transparency for MNN?

   o  Performence:
      *  The delay to discover and set up the optimal path
      *  The packet overhead and/or signaling overhead to discover and
         set up the optimal path
      *  The delay to re-discover and re-build the optimal path when the
         mobility causes the topology change
      *  The packet overhead and/or signaling overhead to re-discover
         and re-build the optimal path when the mobility causes the
         topology change

   o  Management cost:
      *  The number of states established or maintained in MR/CA/HA
      *  The number of MNNs supported by MR/CA/HA

   o  More?
