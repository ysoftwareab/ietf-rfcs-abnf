   Abstract 
    
   This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 
   addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is 
   known as Address Resolution (AR), or Neighbour Discovery (ND). Such 
   address resolution complements the higher layer resource discovery 
   tools that are used to advertise IP sessions. In MPEG-2 networks, an 
   IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) and a specific 
   Transmission Multiplex The document reviews current methods. It also 
   describes the interaction with well-known protocols for address 
   management including DHCP, ARP, and NDP, and provides guidance on 
   usage.

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks              April 2005 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
    
   The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) provides a time-division 
   multiplexed (TDM) stream that may contain audio, video and data 
   information, including encapsulated IP datagrams.  It is defined in 
   specification ISO/IEC 138181 [ISO-MPEG2]. Each Layer-2 frame, known 
   as a TS Packet, contains a 4 byte header and 188 bytes of payload.  
   Each TS Packet is associated with a single TS Logical Channel, 
   identified by a 13 bit Packet ID (PID) value that is carried in the 
   MPEG-2 TS Packet header.   
    
   The MPEG-2 standard also defines a control plane that may be used to 
   transmit control information to Receivers using System Information 
   (SI) Tables [ETSI-SI, ETSI-SI1], or Program Specific Information 
   (PSI) Tables.  
    
   To utilise the MPEG-2 TS as an IP link, a sender must associate an 
   IP address with a particular Transmission Multiplex, and within the 
   multiplex identify the specific PID to be used. This document calls 
   this mapping Address Resolution (AR) [ipdvb-arch]. In some AR 
   schemes, the MPEG-2 TS address space is sub-divided into logical 
   contexts known as Platforms. Each platform associates an IP service 
   provider with a separate context that share a common MPEG-2 TS (use 
   the same PID value).  
    
   MPEG-2 Receivers may use a Network Point of Attachment (NPA) [ipdvb-
   arch] to uniquely identify the L2 node within the MPEG-2 
   transmission network. An example of an NPA is the IEEE Medium Access 
   Control (MAC) address. Where such addresses are used, these must 
   also be signalled by the AR procedure. Finally, address resolution 
   may need to signal the format of the data being transmitted, for 
   example, the encapsulation, any L2 encryption method and any 
   compression scheme [ID-IPDVB-ARCH].  
    
   The remainder of the document describes current mechanisms and their 
   use to associate an IP address with the corresponding TS Multiplex, 
   PID value, the MAC address and/or Platform ID. A range of approaches 
   is described, including Layer-2 methods (utilising MPEG-2 SI 
   tables), and protocols at the IP level (including the IPv4 Address 
   Resolution Protocol, ARP [RFC826] and the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
   Protocol, NDP [RFC2461]).  Interactions and dependencies between 
   these methods and the encapsulation methods are described.

   Channel.  
        
   MPEG-2: A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture Experts  
   Group (MPEG), and standardized by the International Standards  
   Organisation (ISO/IEC 113818-1) [ISO-MPEG2], and ITU-T (in H.220).  
 
   NPA: Network Point of Attachment. In this document, refers to a 6  
   byte destination address (resembling an IEEE MAC address) within the  
   MPEG-2 transmission network that is used to identify individual  
   Receivers or groups of Receivers.   
    
   PID: Packet Identifier  [ISO-MPEG2]. A 13 bit field carried in the  
   header of TS Packets. This is used to identify the TS Logical  
   Channel to which a TS Packet belongs [ISO-MPEG2]. The TS Packets  
   forming the parts of a Table Section, PES, or other Payload Unit  
   must all carry the same PID value.  The all 1s PID value indicates a  
   Null TS Packet introduced to maintain a constant bit rate of a TS  
   Multiplex. There is no required relationship between the PID values  
   used for TS Logical Channels transmitted using different TS  
   Multiplexes. The all 1s PID value indicates a Null TS Packet 
   introduced to maintain a constant bit rate of a TS Multiplex. There 
   is no required relationship between the PID values used for TS 
   Logical Channels transmitted using different TS Multiplexes. 
     
   Private Section: A syntactic structure constructed in accordance  
   with Table 2-30 of [ISO-MPEG2]. The structure may be used to  
   identify private information (i.e. not defined by [ISO-MPEG2])  
   relating to one or more elementary streams, or a specific MPEG-2  
   program, or the entire Transport Stream.  Other Standards bodies,  
   e.g. ETSI, ATSC, have defined sets of table structures using the  
   private_section structure. A Private Section is transmitted as a  
   sequence of TS Packets using a TS Logical Channel. A TS Logical  
   Channel may carry sections from more than one set of tables.  
        
   PSI: Program Specific Information [ISO-MPEG2]. PSI is used to convey  
   information about services carried in a TS Multiplex. It is carried  
   in one of four specifically identified table section constructs 
   [ISO-MPEG2], see also SI Table. 
    
   PSI: Program Specific Information [ISO-MPEG2]. PSI is used to  
   convey information about services carried in a TS Multiplex. 
   It is carried in one of four specifically identified table 
   section constructs [ISO-MPEG2], see also SI Table. 
    
   Receiver: Equipment that processes the signal from a TS Multiplex  
   and performs filtering and forwarding of encapsulated PDUs to the   
   network-layer service (or bridging module when operating at the link   
   layer).  
        
   SI Table: Service Information Table [ISO-MPEG2]. In this document,  
   this term describes a table that is been defined by another  
   standards body to convey information about the services carried in a

   TS Multiplex. A Table may consist of one or more Table Sections, 
   however, all sections of a particular SI Table must be carried over 
   a single TS Logical Channel [ISO-MPEG2].  
     
   SNDU: Subnetwork Data Unit. An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2  
   Payload Unit.  
        
   Table Section: A Payload Unit carrying all or a part of an SI or PSI  
   Table [ISO-MPEG2].

   MPEG-2 level using TS Packets; it represents layer 2 of the ISO/OSI  
   reference model. See also TS Logical Channel and TS Multiplex.  
   to two terrestrial TV transmission cells. 
    
   TS Logical Channel: Transport Stream Logical Channel. In this 
   document, this term identifies a channel at the MPEG-2 level   
   [ISO-MPEG2]. This exists at level 2 of the ISO/OSI reference model.  
   All packets sent over a TS Logical Channel carry the same PID  
   value (this value is unique within a specific TS Multiplex). The  
   term "Stream" is defined in MPEG-2 [ISO-MPEG2]. This describes the    
   content carried by a specific TS Logical Channel (see, ULE Stream).  
   Some PID values are reserved (by MPEG-2) for specific signalling. 
   Other standards (e.g., ATSC, DVB) also reserve specific PID values. 
        
   TS Multiplex: In this document, this term defines a set of MPEG-2 TS  
   Logical Channels sent over a single lower layer connection. This may  
   be a common physical link (i.e. a transmission at a specified symbol  
   rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency) or an encapsulation  
   provided by another protocol layer (e.g. Ethernet, or RTP over IP).  
   The same TS Logical Channel may be repeated over more than one TS  
   Multiplex (possibly associated with a different PID value) [ID- 
   ipdvb-arch], for example to redistribute the same multicast content  
   to two terrestrial TV transmission cells.   
        
   TS Packet: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over a TS Multiplex  
   [ISO-MPEG2]. Each TS Packet carries a 4B header, plus optional  
   overhead including an Adaptation Field, encryption details and time  
   stamp information to synchronise a set of related TS Logical  
   Channels.  
        
   UDL: Unidirectional link: A one-way transmission IP over DVB link, 
   e.g., a broadcast satellite link.  
    
   ULE Stream: An MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel that carries only ULE 
   encapsulated PDUs. ULE Streams may be identified by definition of 
   a stream_type in SI/PSI [ISO_MPEG2].

   3. Address Resolution Requirements  
 
   The MPEG IP address resolution process is independent of the choice 
   of encapsulation and needs to support a set of IP over MPEG-2 
   encapsulation formats, including MPE [ETSI-DAT,ETSI-DAT1, ATSC-DAT]) 
   and the IETF-defined Ultra Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [ID-
   ARCH,ID-ULE].  
    
   The general IP over MPEG-2 AR requirements are summarized below: 
    
        - A scalable and efficient transmission. 
        - A method to represent the AR information.   
        - Support for scoping of the addresses. 
        - Incremental update of clients with AR information. 
        - Procedures for purging stale client AR information.  
        - A method to identify the Server sourcing AR information. 
        - A method to install AR information at the AR server 
          (unsolicited registration).  
        - Security associations to authenticate the AR information.  
    
   An MPEG-2 Transmission Network may support multiple IP networks. 
   If this is the case, it is important to recognise the context 
   (scope) within which an address is resolved, to prevent packets from 
   one addressed scope leaking into other scopes. Examples of 
   overlapping IP address assignments include:   
    
   (i)  Private unicast addresses (e.g. in IPv4, 10/8 prefix;  
        172.16/12 prefix; 192.168/16 prefix) should be confined to  
        one addressed area. IPv6 also defines link-local addresses that 
        must not be forwarded beyond the link on which they were first 
        sent. 
    
   (ii) Some multicast addresses, (e.g., the scoped multicast  
        addresses sometimes used in private networks). These are  
        only valid within an addressed area (examples for IPv4  
        include; 239/8; 224.0.0/24; 224.0.1/24). Similar cases  
        exist for some IPv6 multicast addresses.  
    
   (iii)Scoped multicast addresses.  Forwarding of these addresses  
        is controlled by the scope associated with the address. 
    
    
   Overlapping address assignments may also occur at L2, where the same 
   NPA/MAC address is used to identify multiple receivers [ID-IPDVB-
   ARCH]: 
    
   (i)  An NPA unicast address must be unique within the addressed  
        area. The IEEE assigned MAC addresses used in Ethernet LANs are        
        Globally unique. If the NPA addresses are not globally unique,  
        an NPA address must only be re-used by receivers in  
        different addressed (scoped) areas.

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks              April 2005 
 
 
   (ii) The NPA broadcast address (all 1 MAC address). Traffic 
        with this address should be confined to one addressed area. 
         
   (iii) IP and other protocols may view sets of MAC multicast 
        addresses as link-local, and may produce unexpected results if 
        frames with these address are distributed across several 
        private networks. 
    
    
   Reception of unicast packets destined for another addressed area 
   will lead to an increase in the rate of received packets by systems  
   connected via the network. Reception of the additional network 
   traffic may contribute to processing load, but should not lead to 
   unexpected protocol behaviour. It does however introduce a potential 
   Denial of Service (DoS) opportunity.  When the Receiver operates as 
   an IP router, the receipt of such a packet can lead to unexpected 
   protocol behaviour.  
    
    
3.1 Unicast Support 
    
   Unicast address resolution may be required at two levels. At the 
   upper level, the AR procedure needs to associate an IP address with 
   a specific NPA/MAC address. At the lower level, the IP (or MAC) 
   address needs to be associated with a specific TS Logical Channel 
   (PID value) and the corresponding TS Multiplex. 
    
   The same unicast IP address may be associated with more than one TS 
   Logical Channel within the same scope [DVB-DAT]. These may have 
   different content, but there is also the possibility of a Receiver 
   receiving duplicated copies of packets. 
 
    
3.2 Multicast Support  
    
   Multicast is an important application for MPEG-2 Transmission 
   Networks, since it exploits the advantages of native support for 
   link broadcast. 
    
   Multicast address resolution occurs at one level in associating a 
   specific L2 address with am IP Group Destination Address (section 
   5).  In IPv4 and IPv6 over Ethernet, this association is normally a 
   direct mapping, and this is the default method also specified in 
   both ULE [ID-IPDVB-ULE] and in MPE [ETSI-DAT]. 
    
   Address resolution must also occur at the MPEG-2 level (section 4). 
   The goal of this multicast address resolution is the association of 
   an IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address with a specific TS Logical Channel 
   (PID value) and the corresponding TS Multiplex.  This association 
   needs to permit a large number of active multicast groups, and 
   should minimise the processing load at the Receiver when filtering 
   and forwarding IP multicast packets. For example, schemes that may

   be easily implemented in hardware would be beneficial, since these 
   may relieve the drivers and operating systems from discarding 
   unwanted multicast traffic.   
    
   There are specific issues concerning IPv4 and IPv6 multicast over 
   MPEG-2 Transmission Networks:   
    
   (i)  Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS  
        Logical Channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex.  
    
   (ii) Provide signalling information to allow a receiver to  
        locate an IP multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex.  
    
   (iii) Determining group membership (e.g. utilising IGMP/MLD). 
        
   Methods are required to identify the scope of an address when an 
   MPEG-2 transmission network supports several logical IP network and 
   carries groups within different multicast scopes. 
    
   Appropriate procedures need to specify the correct action when the 
   same multicast group is available on separate TS Logical Channels.  
   This could arise when different end hosts act as senders to 
   contribute IP packets with the same IP Group Destination Address in 
   the ASM address range.  
    
   Another different case arises when a Receiver could receive more 
   than one copy of the same packet (e.g. when packets are replicated 
   across different TS Logical Channels, or even different TS 
   Multiplexes, a method also known as Simulcasting [DVB-DAT]). In this 
   case, at the IP level, the host/router may be unaware of this 
   duplication and it needs to be detected by other means.

4. MPEG-2 Address Resolution  
    
   In this section, current MPEG-2 address resolution mechanisms are 
   reviewed.  
     
    
4.1 Static configuration.  
    
   The static mapping option, where IP addresses or flows are 
   statically mapped to specific PIDs is the equivalent to signalling 
   "out-of-band". The application programmer, installing engineer, or 
   user receives the mapping via some outside means, not in the MPEG-2 
   TS. This is useful for testing, experimental networks, small 
   subnetworks and closed domains.  
    
   A single "well-known" PID is a specialisation of this. This scheme 
   is used by current DOCSIS cable modems [DOCSIS], where all IP 
   traffic is placed into the specified TS stream. Section or MAC 
   filtering may be used to differentiate subnetworks.  
    
    
4.1.1 MPEG-2 Cable Networks 
    
   Cable networks use a different transmission schemes for downstream, 
   (headend to cable modem/STB) and upstream (cablemodem/STB to 
   headend) transmission.  
    
   The information is sent (on the downstream) to the STBs as 
   IP/Ethernet packets encapsulated in MPEG-2 TS Packets sent on a 
   single well-known TS Logical Channel (PID); there is no use of 
   inband tables. On the upstream, the common approach is to use 
   Ethernet framing, rather than IP/Ethernet over MPEG-2, although 
   other proprietary schemes also continue to be used. 
    
   Until the deployment of DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS, most address 
   resolution schemes in cable networks for IP traffic was proprietary, 
   and did not usually employ a table-based address resolution method. 
   Proprietary methods continue to be used in some cases where STBs 
   require interaction. In this case, equipment at the headend may act 
   as gateways between the cablemodem/STB and the Internet. These 
   gateways receive L2 information and allocate an IP address.  
    
   DOCSIS utilises DHCP for IP client configuration. The Cable Modem 
   Terminal System (CMTS) provides a DHCP server that allocates IP 
   addresses to DOCSIS cable modems and STBs. The MPEG-2 Transmission 
   Network provides a L2 bridged network to the cable modem. This 
   usually acts as a DHCP relay for IP devices [RFC2131, RFC3256]. 
   Issues in deployment of IPv6 are described in [ID-V6OPS-DEPLOY].

4.2 MPEG-2 Table-Based Address Resolution  
    
   The information about the set of MPEG-2 TS streams carried over a TS 
   Multiplex can be distributed via tables that are assigned a specific 
   and well-known set of PID values. This design requires access to and 
   processing of the SI Table information [ETSI-SI, ETSI-SI1].  This 
   scheme reflects the complexity of delivering and co-ordinating the 
   various TS associated with multimedia TV. A TS Multiplex may provide 
   AR information for IP services by integrating additional information 
   into the existing MPEG-2 tables or by transmitting additional SI 
   Tables specific to the IP service. 
    
   Examples of MPEG-2 Table usage to allow an MPEG-2 Receiver to 
   identify the appropriate PID and multiplex associated with a 
   specific IP address include:   
    
   (i)  IP/MAC Notification Table (INT) in the DVB Data standard  
        [ETSI-DAT]. This provides uni-directional address resolution of  
        IPv4/IPv6 multicast addresses to MPEG-2 TS.             
    
   (ii) Application Information Table (AIT) in the Multimedia  
        Home Platform (MHP) specifications [ETSI-MHP].  
                  
   (iii)Multicast Mapping Table (MMT) an MPEG-2 Table employed by some 
        DVB-RCS systems to provide uni-directional address resolution 
        of IPv4 multicast addresses to MPEG-2 TS.  
    
   The MMT and AIT are used for specific applications. The INT [DVB-
   DAT] is a more general DVB standard, that supports MAC, IPv4, and 
   IPv6 AR when used in combination with the other MPEG-2 tables.  
    
     
4.2.1 IP/MAC Notification Table (INT) and its usage 
    
   The INT provides a mechanism for carrying information about the 
   location of IP/L2 flows within a DVB network. The INT defines the 
   concept of a Platform_ID, which may identify the addressing scope 
   for a set of IP/L2 streams and/or Receivers. A Platform may span 
   several transport streams within one or multiple DVB multiplexes and 
   represents a single IP network with a harmonized address space (i.e. 
   addressing scope). This allows for the coexistence of several non-
   harmonized IP/MAC address spaces on the same DVB network.  
      
   The INT allows both fully-specified IP addresses and prefix matching 
   to reduce the size of table (and hence enhance signalling 
   efficiency). An IPv4/IPv6 "subnet mask" may be given in full form or 
   in slash notation (e.g. /127).  
      
   IP multicast addresses can be specified with or without a source 
   (address or range), although if a source address is specified, then 
   only the slash notation may be used for prefixes.

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks              April 2005 
 
 
   In addition to identification and security descriptors, the 
   following descriptors are defined for address binding in INT tables:  
    
   (i)   target_MAC_address_descriptor: The descriptor used to  
         describe a single or set of MAC addresses (and their mask).             
    
  (ii) target_MAC_address_range_descriptor: May be used to set  
        filters.  
    
   (iii) target_IP_address_descriptor: The descriptor describing a    
         single or set of IPv4 unicast or multicast addresses (and     
         their mask).  
    
   (iv) target_IP_slash_descriptor:  Allows definition and announcement  
        of an IPv4 prefix.  
    
   (v)  target_IP_source_slash_descriptor: Uses source and destination  
        addresses to target a single or set of systems.  
    
   (vi) IP/MAC  stream_location_descriptor: This descriptor locates an  
        IP/MAC stream in a DVB network.  
    
   The following descriptors provide corresponding functions for IPv6 
   addresses: 
          
        target_IPv6_address_descriptor  
        target_IPv6_slash_descriptor  
        and target_IPv6_source_slash_descriptor  
         
   The ISP_access_mode_descriptor allows specification of a second 
   address descriptor to access an ISP via an alternative non-DVB 
   (possibly non-IP) network.  
    
   The INT provides a set of descriptors to specify addressing in a DVB 
   network. One key benefit is that the approach follows the MPEG-2 
   signaling methods and is integrated with the other signalling 
   information. This allows the INT to operate in the presence of 
   (re)multiplexors [ipdvb-arch] and refer to PID values that are 
   carried within a number of different TS Multiplexes. This makes it 
   well-suited to a Broadcast TV Scenario [ipdvb-arch]. 
    
   The principle drawbacks are that while the INT, there is a need for 
   a Gateway to introduce associated PSI/SI MPEG-2 control information. 
   This control information also needs to be processed at the receiver 
   below the IP layer, and the position of this processing within the 
   protocol stack makes it hard to associate the results with IP 
   Policy, management and security functions. The use of centralized 
   management prevents the implementation of a more dynamic scheme. The 
   method is currently defined only for Multi-Protocol Encapsulation 
   (MPE) and would need extension to support other schemes.

4.2.2 Multicast Mapping Table (MMT) and its usage 
    
   The Multicast Mapping Table (MMT) is an MPEG-2 level control table 
   to that associates a set of multicast addresses with the 
   corresponding PID values.  This table allows a DVB-RCS Forward Link 
   Subsystem (FLSS) to specify the mapping of IPv4 addresses to PID 
   values within a specific TS Multiplex. Receivers (DVB-RCS Return 
   Channel Satellite Terminals, RCSTs) may use this table to determine 
   the PID values associated with an IP multicast flow that it requires 
   to receive. The MMT is not currently a part of the DVB-RCS 
   specification. 
    
      
4.2.3 Application Information Table (AIT) and its usage 
     
   The DVB Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) specification does not define 
   a specific AR function. However, the MHP Standard specifies an 
   Application Information Table (AIT) that allows MHP Receivers to 
   receive a variety of control information. The AIT uses a DSMCC 
   format table providing information about data broadcasts, the 
   required activation state of applications carried by a broadcast 
   stream, etc. This information allows a broadcaster to request that a 
   Receiver change the activation state of an application, and to 
   direct applications to receive specific multicast packet flows 
   (using IPv4 or IPv6 descriptors).  In MHP, AR is not seen as a 
   specific function, but as a part of a wider configuration and 
   control function.  
    
4.2.4 Comparison of SI/PSI table approaches  
     
   The MPEG-2 methods based on SI/PSI meet the specified requirements 
   of the groups that created them and all have their strength:  the 
   INT in terms of flexibility and extensibility, the MMT in its 
   simplicity, the AIT in its extensibility. However, they exhibit 
   scalability constraints, encourage the development of technology 
   specific solutions and do not fully adopt IP-centric approaches that 
   would enable easier use of the MPEG-2 bearer as a link technology 
   within the wider Internet. 
    
4.3 IP-based resolution of TS Logical Channels 
    
   As MPEG-2 transmission networks evolve to become multiservice 
   networks, the use of IP protocols is becoming more prevalent. 
   Most MPEG-2 networks now use some IP protocols for operations, 
   control and data delivery, transmission using IP packets could 
   also be used for address resolution. The advantages of using a 
   IP-based address resolution for TS streams include: 
    
   (i) Simplicity: 
   The AR mechanism does not require interpretation of Layer 2 
   tables; this is an advantage especially in the growing market 
   share for home network and audio video networked entities.

INTERNET DRAFT  AR for IP over MPEG-2 networks              April 2005 
 
 
    
   (ii) Uniformity: 
   An IP-based protocol can provide a common method across 
   different network scenarios for IP/MAC address mappings to TS 
   Logical Channels (PID Values). 
      
   (iii) Extensibility: 
   IP-based AR mechanisms allow an independent evolution of the AR 
   protocol. This includes dynamic methods to request address 
   resolution and the ability to include other L2 information 
   (e.g. Encryption keys). 
    
   (iv) Integration 
   The information exchanged by IP-based AR protocols can easily 
   be integrated as a a part of the IP network layer, simplifying 
   support for AAA, policy, OAM, mobility, configuration control, 
   etc. that combine AR with security. 
    
   Drawbacks of an IP-based method include: 
    
   One drawback of IP-based AR is that this method can not operate 
   over an MPEG-2 Transmission Network that uses remultiplexors 
   [ipdvb-arch] to modify the PID values of the TS Logical 
   Channels during the multiplexing operation. This makes the 
   method unsuitable for use in deployed broadcast TV networks 
   [ipdvb-arch]. 
    
   IP-based methods can also introduce concerns about the 
   integrity of the information and authentication of the sender 
   [ipdvb-arch] (These concerns are also applicable to MPEG-2 
   table methods, but in this case the information is confined to 
   the L2 network, or parts of the network where gateway devices 
   isolate the MPEG devices from the larger Internet creating 
   virtual MPEG2 private networks.) IP-based solutions should 
   therefore implement security mechanisms that may be used to 
   authenticate the sender and verify the integrity of the AR 
   information, as a part of a larger security framework. 
    
4.3.1 IP-based multicast resolution of TS Logical Channels 
    
   AR resolution must also be performed to associate the IP multicast 
   Group Destination Address with an MPEG-2 layer TS Logical Channel 
   (PID) and TS Multiplex. Solutions have been described in 4.2 to 
   perform this below the IP layer using MPEG-2 Tables.  Such methods 
   currently perform a direct mapping (where a single address or set of 
   addresses are associated with a specific PID value).  
    
   There is an opportunity to define an IP-level method that could use 
   an IP multicast protocol over a well-known IP multicast address. 
   Scalability is an important feature of any multicast AR protocol, 
   methods that employ prefix matching (e.g. where a range of 
   source/destination addresses are matched to a single entry are

   desirable), but so also are methods that allow a range of addresses 
   to mapped to a set of TS Logical Channels (similar to the mapping of 
   IP Group Destination Addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses).

5. Mapping IP addresses to NPA/MAC addresses  
    
   This section reviews IETF protocols that may be used to assign and 
   manage the mapping of IP addresses to/from NPA/MAC addresses.  
    
   IP Encapsulation Gateways may require AR information to select an 
   appropriate MAC/NPA address in the SNDU header [ipdvb-arch] (see 
   also section 6). The information to complete this header may be 
   taken directly from a neighbour/arp cache, or may require the 
   Gateway to retrieve the information using an AR protocol. The way in 
   which this information is collected will depend upon whether the 
   Gateway functions as a Router (at L3) or a Bridge (at L2).  
    
   Two IETF-defined protocols for mapping IP addresses to NPA/MAC 
   addresses are ARP [RFC-ARP] and NDP [RFC-ND] for IPv4 and IPv6 
   respectively. Both protocols are normally used in a bi-directional 
   mode, although both also permit unsolicited transmission of 
   mappings. The mapping defined in [RFC2464] may result in use of a 
   large number of L2 MAC addresses. 
    
   ARP requires support for L2 broadcast packets. 
    
   << inputs requested on ARP scalability to large receiver groups >> 
    
   << inputs requested on ARP security for wireless networks >> 
    
   << inputs requested on ARP scoping when supporting multiple ISPs >> 
    
    
   The NDP uses a set of IP multicast addresses. In large networks, 
   many multicast addresses are likely to be used, although little 
   traffic is likely to be sent in each group. The AR multicast 
   mechanism therefore needs to be able to support this in a scalable 
   manner (see section XXX).

   << inputs requested on NDP security for wireless networks >> 
    
   << inputs requested on NDP scoping when supporting multiple ISPs >> 
 
 
 
 
5.1 Uni-directional links supporting uni-directional connectivity 
    
   Most MPEG-2 Transmission Networks provide a Uni-Directional 
   broadcast link (UDL), with no return path. Such links may be used 
   for unicast applications that do not require a return path (e.g. 
   based on UDP), but are more commonly used for IP multicast content 
   distribution.

   Although ARP and NDP may both operate in an unsolicited/promiscuous 
   mode where they advertise information to the remote nodes, this does 
   not provide an appropriate method to resolve the remote 
   (destination) address in a uni-directional environment. To perform 
   this task, these protocols require bi-directional L2/L3 
   connectivity.

5.2 Uni-directional links with bi-directional connectivity 
    
   Bi-directional connectivity may be realised using a pair of uni-
   directional in combination with another network path. Common 
   combinations are a Feed link using MPEG-2 satellite transmission and 
   a return link using terrestrial network infrastructure. This 
   topology is often known as a Hybrid network, and has asymmetric 
   network routing. It also often exhibits asymmetric network capacity

5.4 IP Multicast AR 
    
   This section describes the case where the destination network layer 
   address is an IP multicast Group Destination Address.  
    
   In MPE [DVB-DAT], the mapping of IP multicast addresses to MAC/NPA 
   addresses follows normal practice for IEEE MAC Addresses when using 
   IPv4 and IPv6. (A variant of DVB (DVB-H) uses a modified MAC header 
   [DVB_DAT]). 
    
   In ULE [ID-IPDVB-ULE], the L2 NPA address is optional, and is not 
   necessarily required when the Receiver is able to perform efficient 
   L3 multicast address filtering. When present, it follows the mapping 
   of MPE and many other L2 link technologies.

6. Link Layer Support 
    
   This section considers layer 2 support for address resolution. It

   encapsulation for transmission to utilise the AR method. The table

6.1 ULE without a destination MAC/NPA address (D=1) 
    
   The ULE encapsulation supports a mode (D=1) where the NPA/MAC 
   address is not present in the encapsulated frame. This mode may be 
   used with both IPv4 and IPv6.  When this mode is used, the Receiver 
   is expected to perform network-layer filtering of packets based on 
   their IP destination address. Encapsulation Gateways must ensure 
   that packets are associated with a TS Logical Channel (PID value) 
   that uniquely identifies the intended recipient [IP-IPDVB-ULE]. This 
   requires careful consideration of the network topology when used as 
   a link between IP routers (a simple case where this is permitted is 
   the connection of stub networks). 
    
   Since there is no MAC/NPA address in the SNDU, ARP and NDP are not 
   required. 
    
   Note, since IPv6 systems can (and usually do) automatically 
   configure their IPv6 network address based upon a local MAC address, 
   the IP driver at the Receiver may still need to access the MAC/NPA 
   address of the receiving interface.

6.2 ULE with a destination NPA/MAC address (D=0) 
    
   The IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC826] uses an IANA-
   assigned EtherType and may be used over a link that supports ULE 
   [IP-IPDVB-ULE]. Although no MAC source address is present in the 
   SNDU, the protocol still communicates the source MAC address in the 
   ARP record payload of any query messages that it generates. 
    
   The ND protocol of IPv6 [RFC2461] may be used.NDP does not require 
   specification of a MAC source address, although this is required for 
   a node to participate in Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). 
    
    << More info on use of ND is required, also on usage of DAD and 
   SEND>> 
    
    
6.3 MPE without LLC/SNAP Encapsulation 
    
   This is the default (and sometimes only) mode specified by most MPE 
   Encapsulation Gateways. 
    
   MPE does not provide an IANA-assigned EtherType and therefore can 
   not support the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC826]. 
    
   IPv6 is not supported in this encapsulation format, and therefore it 
   is not appropriate to consider the NDP. 
    
    
6.4 MPE with LLC/SNAP Encapsulation 
    
   The LLC/SNAP format of MPE provides an IANA-assigned EtherType and 
   therefore may support the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) 
   [RFC826]. There is no specification to define how this is performed. 
   No MAC source address is present in the SNDU, although the protocol 
   still communicates the source MAC address in the ARP record payload 
   of any query messages that it generates. 
    
   The ND protocol of IPv6 [RFC2461] may be used with The LLC/SNAP 
   format of MPE.  NDP does not require specification of a MAC source 
   address, although this is required for a node to participate in 
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). 
    
    << More info on use of ND is required, also on usage of DAD and 
   SEND>> 
    
    
6.5 ULE with Bridging Header Extension (D=1) 
    
   The ULE encapsulation supports a bridging extension header that 
   supplies both a source and destination MAC address.  This can be 
   used without an NPA address (D=1). When no other Extension Headers 
   are present, the MAC destination address has the same position in

   the ULE SNDU as that used for an NPA destination address.  The 
   Receiver may optionally be configured so that MAC destination 
   address value is identical to the Receiver NPA address. 
    
   At the Encapsulation Gateway, the ULE NPA/MAC destination address is 
   determined by a L2 forwarding decision.  Received frames may be 
   forwarded or may be addressed to the Receiver itself. As in other L2 
   LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received frames based on a 
   configured MAC destination address filter. 
    
   ARP messages may be carried within a PDU that is bridged by this 
   encapsulation format.  
    
   The NDP messages may be carried within an IPv6 PDU that is bridged 
   by this encapsulation format.  
    
    
6.6 ULE with Bridging Header Extension and NPA Address (D=0) 
    
   The combination of a NPA address (D=0) and a bridging extension 
   header are allowed in ULE. This SNDU format supplies both a source 
   and destination MAC address and a NPA destination address (i.e. 
   Receiver NPA/MAC address).  
    
   At the Encapsulation Gateway, the ULE NPA/MAC destination address is 
   determined by a L2 forwarding decision. Received frames may be 
   forwarded or may be addressed to the Receiver itself. As in other L2 
   LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received frames based on a 
   configured MAC destination address filter. 
    
   An ARP message may be carried within a PDU that is bridged by this 
   encapsulation format.  
    
   An NDP message may be carried within an IPv6 PDU that is bridged by 
   this encapsulation format.  
    
    
6.7 MPE+LLC/SNAP+Bridging 
    
   The LLC/SNAP format MPE frames may optionally support an IEEE 
   bridging header [LLC]. This header supplies both a source and 
   destination MAC address, at the expense of larger encapsulation 
   overhead. This format defines two MAC destination addresses, one 
   associated with the MPE SNDU (i.e. Receiver MAC address) and one 
   with the bridged MAC frame (i.e. the MAC address of the intended 
   recipient in the remote LAN). At the Encapsulation Gateway, the MPE 
   MAC destination address is determined by a L2 forwarding decision. 
   As in other L2 LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received 
   frames based on a configured MAC destination address filter. 
    
   At the Encapsulation Gateway, the MPE MAC destination address is 
   determined by a L2 forwarding decision. Received frames may be

   forwarded or may be addressed to the Receiver itself. As in other L2 
   LANs, the Receiver may choose to filter received frames based on a 
   configured MAC destination address filter. 
    
   An ARP message may be carried within a PDU that is bridged by this 
   encapsulation format.  
    
   An NDP message may be carried within an IPv6 PDU that is bridged by 
   this encapsulation format. The MPE MAC destination address is 
   determined by a L2 forwarding decision.

7. Conclusions  
    
   This document has described addressing and address resolution issues 
   concerning the use of IP protocols over MPEG-2 transmission 
   networks. A number of specific IETF protocols are discussed along 
   with their expected behaviour over MPEG-2 transmission networks and 
   recommendations for usage.  
    
   In current MPEG-2 networks, a static binding may be configured for 
   IP addresses and PIDs (as in some cable networks).  This information 
   may also be provided by the Gateway/Multiplexor and carried in 
   tables (e.g. AIT in MHP, the IP Notification Table, INT, of DVB and 
   the DVB-RCS Multicast Mapping Table, MMT). This document has 
   reviewed the status of these current address resolution mechanisms 
   in MPEG-2 transmission networks, defined their usage and provided 
   information to identify what would be needed to improve their 
   support for IP protocols. 
     
      
8. Security Considerations  
    
   The normal security issues relating to the use of wireless links for 
   transport Internet traffic should be considered.  Readers are also 
   referred to the known security issues associated with ARP [RFC826] 
   and ND [RFC-ND].

APPENDIX B: Candidate IP-based L2 AR Protocols 
    
   This appendix contains a list of candidate protocols for "above IP" 
   AR. None of these protocols currently support the AR methods 
   required for MPEG-2 Transmission Networks. Specifically they do not 
   all support: 
    
   (i) Resolution of Addresses to TS Logical Channels 
   (ii) Resolution of multiple addresses in a single AR update message 
   (table-based). 
   (iii) Multicast transport. 
    
   Candidate protocols include: 
    
   ARP <extension required> 
    - IPv4 only. 
    - No table support <could be added> 
    - Support for versioning within current implementations not clear. 
    - Broadcast mode has drawbacks. 
    - No obvious support for scoping to multiple addressing domains. 
    
   ND <extension required> 
    - IPv6 only. 
    - No table support <could be added> 
    - Use multicast address. 
    - No obvious support for scoping to multiple addressing domains. 
    
   DTCP [RFC3077]  <extension required> 
    - IPv4 and IPv6. 
    - Table support seems natural. 
    - Uses multicast address. 
    - Need to consider scoping for multiple addressing domains. 
    - Not really an IP AR protocol 
    - Already used on some (UDLR) links - and this new use seems 
   complementary. 
    
   AR/IP  <new protocol required> 
    - IPv4 and IPv6. 
    - Based on UDP or at network-layer. 
    - Could use multicast address. 
    - Table support possible. 
    - New protocol format. 
    - Could add scoping for multiple addressing domains. 
    
   XML/foo/IP <new protocol required> 
    - IPv4 and IPv6. 
    - Based on UDP or at network-layer or an XML transport (which?). 
    - Could use multicast address. 
    - Table support seems natural. 
    - New protocol format. 
    - Could add scoping for multiple addressing domains. 
    - Extensible/flexible to other configuration data (if required).
