Abstract

   Along with providing support for certain basic authentication,
   authorization and accounting functions, the Diameter base protocol is
   intended to provide a framework for AAA applications.

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   which describes the minimum set of objects needed to manage an
   implementation of the Diameter Credit Control application.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
   managing the Diameter base protocol.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the author.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC1215].

3.  Overview

   The base Diameter protocol [RFC3588] is never used alone; it is
   always extended for a particular application.  Four Diameter
   applications have been defined to date: NASREQ [RFC4005], Mobile IP
   [RFC4004] [RFC3141], Credit Control [RFC4006] and EAP [RFC4072];
   others may be defined in the future.

   This MIB defines objects supporting the management of the Diameter
   Credit Control Application protocol as described in [RFC4006].  The
   MIB specification for the Diameter base protocol [BASEMIB] SHOULD be
   implemented prior to the implementation of this MIB.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID under mib-2.

6.  Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read) the
   objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.
