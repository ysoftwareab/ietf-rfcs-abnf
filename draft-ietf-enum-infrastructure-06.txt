1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC-2119 [5]. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that transforms 
   E.164 numbers [2] into domain names and then uses the DNS (Domain 
   Name Service) [3] to discover NAPTR records that specify what 
   services are available for a specific domain name. 
 
   ENUM as originally defined was based on the end-user opt-in 
   principle.  While this has great potential to foster new services and 
   end-user choice in the long-term, the current requirements for IP-
   based interconnection of Voice over IP (VoIP) domains require the 
   provisioning of large numbers of allocated or served (hosted) numbers 
   of a participating service provider, without the need for individual 
   users to opt-in or not and so that service providers can provision 
   their own ENUM information that is separate, distinct, and likely to 
   be different from what and end-user may provision.  This is 
   particularly important if Infrastructure ENUM is used for number 
   portability applications, for example, which an end-user would be 
   unlikely to be interested in provisioning but which a service 
   provider would likely find essential.   
    
   In addition, while it is possible that service providers could 
   mandate that their users opt-in into e164.arpa through end-user

   contract terms and conditions, there are substantial downsides to 
   such an approach.  Thus, for all these reasons and many others, ENUM 
   for end-user provisioning is ill-suited for use by service providers 
   for the interconnection of VoIP domains. 
    
   As VoIP evolves and becomes pervasive, E.164-addressed telephone 
   calls need not necessarily traverse the Public Switched Telephone 
   Network (PSTN).  Therefore, VoIP service providers have an interest 
   in using ENUM, on a so-called "Infrastructure" basis, to keep VoIP 
   traffic on IP networks on an end-to-end basis, both within and 
   between service provider domains. This requires of means of 
   identifying a VoIP point of interconnection to which calls addressed 
   to a given E.164 number may be delivered and Infrastructure ENUM 
   provides this means.  Calls that can originate and terminate on IP 
   networks, and not have to traverse the PSTN, will require fewer or no 
   points of transcoding, and can also involve additional IP network 
   services that are not possible on the PSTN, among other benefits.   
    
   Requirements for Infrastructure ENUM are provided in[4].   
    
   This document defines that Infrastructure ENUM be implemented by 
   means of a parallel namespace to e164.arpa dedicated to 
   Infrastructure ENUM, in a domain which is to be determined. Use of a 
   parallel namespace allows carriers and end users to control their 
   ENUM registrations for a number independently without forcing one to 
   work through the other. 
   
   Infrastructure ENUM Tier 2 resource records in the Infrastructure 
   ENUM tree would be controlled by the service provider that is 
   providing services to a given E.164 number, generally referred to in 
   various nations as the "carrier of record" (see [4]).  The definition 
   of a carrier of record for a given E.164 number is a national matter 
   or is defined by the entity controlling the numbering space.

   See Section 3, Requirements, in [4]. 
    
4. IANA Considerations 
 
   This document contains no requested IANA actions.   
    
   IANA has created a registry for Enumservices as originally specified 
   in RFC 2916 and revised in RFC 3761.  Enumservices registered with 
   IANA are valid for Infrastructure ENUM as well as end-user ENUM.   
    
5. Security and Privacy Considerations
