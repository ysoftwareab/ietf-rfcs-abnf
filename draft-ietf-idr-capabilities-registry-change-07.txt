          Revision to Capability Codes Registration Procedures
             draft-ietf-idr-capabilities-registry-change-07

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration
   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range
   formerly designated "Reserved for Private Use" is divided into three
   new ranges, respectively designated as "First Come First Served",
   "Experimental Use" and "Reserved".

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5492] designates the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as
   "Reserved for Private Use".  Subsequent experience has shown this to
   be not only useless, but actively confusing to implementors.

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for
   the range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in
   [RFC8126]:

   o  128-238: First Come First Served
   o  239-254: Experimental Use
   o  255: Reserved

   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,
   remaining "IETF Review" and "First Come First Served" respectively.

2.  Discussion

   The reason for providing an Experimental Use range is to preserve a
   range for use during early development.  Although there are few
   practical differences between Experimental and Private Use, the
   change both makes it clear that code points from this space should
   not be used long-term or in shipping products, and reduces the
   consumption of the scarce Capability Code space expended for this
   purpose.  Once classified as Experimental, it should be considered
   difficult to reclassify the space for some other purpose in the
   future.

   The reason for reserving the maximum value is that it may be useful
   in the future if extension of the number space is needed.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to revise the "Capability Codes" registry in the
   "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group as follows.

   Reference: [RFC5492] and this document.

   Registration procedures:

                   +---------+-------------------------+
                   |  Range  | Registration Procedures |
                   +---------+-------------------------+

                   |  64-238 | First Come First Served |
                   | 239-254 | Experimental            |
                   +---------+-------------------------+

   Note: a separate "owner" column is not provided because the owner of
   all registrations, once made, is "IESG".

   IANA is requested to perform the following new allocations within the
   "Capability Codes" registry:

4.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing [RFC5492] and
   [RFC4271].
