                 Configurable Car Infotainment Service
                          draft-sjkoh-ccis-01

Abstract

   As the connected car and autonomous car technologies grows, many car
   manufacturers are interested in in-vehicle infotainment (IVI)
   services.  In addition, car-sharing services are expected to attract
   attention in the future automotive industry.  The devices and
   contents in the car are frequently used not only by the car owner but
   also by others.  Automobile manufacturers are currently researching
   on developing their own IVI service platforms.  Contrary to these
   trends, however, IVI services present a risk that anyone can access
   the IVI services and lack scalability with other manufacturers.

   In this document, we introduce the system which provide the basic
   function that can be commonly used in IVI services growing very
   rapidly.  This system is consisting of master, device and user.  This
   system Users are categorized into different types, and services
   provided by devices have different levels.  These are registered and
   managed by master.  So, users are delivered different services
   according to user type.  In addition, devices can be dynamically
   registered and deregistered to the master.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   With the development of the autonomous car, automobiles are becoming
   a cultural life space than the original purpose of automobiles.  This
   has led many manufacturers to be interested in the research of in-
   vehicle infotainment (IVI) services and devices, as illustrated by
   the examples of Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW, and General Motors.  The
   infotainment is a new compound word combining 'information' and
   'entertainment'.  Infotainment devices include navigation systems,
   cameras, speakers, headrest displays, air-conditioners, thermometers
   and heating seats, and light.

   Despite these trends, the current IVI system provides only a
   manufacturer's own service platform and is not flexible compatible
   with other manufacturers.  It is difficult for a user to add/remove
   their infotainment device arbitrarily.  This leads to inconvenient,
   like having to unify all their infotainment devices into one
   manufacturer.  Therefore, research on IVI services that provide
   integrated management for IVI devices is needed.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Overview of CCIS

   The Car Configurable Infotainment Services (CCIS) is a service that
   provides a function of integrated management of in-vehicle
   infotainment for users.  The CCIS consists of CCIS user, CCIS device,
   and CCIS master.  Figure 1 describes the CCIS overview.

   The CCIS system connects the CCIS master to the CCIS user's device
   and a variety of CCIS devices within a car to control the CCIS
   devices.  The CCIS users can be classified into 4 types: Car Owner,
   Temporary Owner, Private Owner, and Public Owner.  Different services
   are available depending on the user type.  This is discussed in
   detail in section 3 of this specification.  The CCIS users can access
   CCIS devices with registration and authentication processes with the
   CCIS master.  Then, the CCIS users can utilize CCIS services through
   a communication interface with CCIS master, in which a CCIS user may
   control a CCIS device or enjoy the CCIS content contained in the
   device.  CCIS devices are divided into personal devices such as
   headrest displays and heated seats and shared devices that can affect
   other CCIS users.  The CCIS master shall provide a user interface for
   CCIS services and store CCIS device information and CCIS profile,
   like device status and availability.

2.  CCIS Entities

2.1.  CCIS user

   The CCIS user is a user that can utilize and control the CCIS devices
   within the car with the help of CCIS master.  CCIS user is classified
   into Car Owner, Temporary Owner, Public Client, and Private Client.
   CCIS user can be registered/removed to CCIS master through initial
   setup or user registration/removal procedure.  CCIS users who are not
   registered to the CCIS master cannot utilize the CCIS service.  In
   addition, through the authority check of the CCIS master, CCIS users
   can only utilize CCIS services that meet the authority of each user
   type.  Depending on the user type, it must be restricted to utilize
   CCIS services such as registration/removal, device control, and
   contents delivery.

2.2.  CCIS device

   The CCIS device is a device that can be controlled and managed by a
   CCIS master in a vehicle.  This includes not only devices (smart
   phone, speaker, black box, etc.) but also multimedia contents (music,
   video, navigation information, etc.).  Each CCIS device can be
   accessed by one or more CCIS users, depending on device
   characteristics.  The CCIS device can be utilized after registering
   to CCIS master through Car Owner.  The CCIS user must control and
   utilize the CCIS device only through the CCIS master.

2.3.  CCIS master

   The CCIS master is a center device to provide overall management and
   control functions for CCIS services and CCIS users.  The CCIS master
   has CCIS user registration/removal, CCIS device registration/removal,
   device control, device monitoring, and contents delivery.  The CCIS
   master connects the CCIS user with the CCIS device and provides an
   interface to the CCIS user.  The CCIS master must store both user and
   device information.  The CCIS master checks the service level that
   can be accessed by the user based on the information stored when
   registering the user or device.

3.  CCIS Level

   All services provided by the CCIS master have a service level so that
   the CCIS master can deliver the different services according to the
   CCIS user type.  Each CCIS service is categorized into Service Level
   High, Service Level Medium, and Service Level Low. Private Client or
   Public Client can use low level CCIS and Temporary Owner can
   additionally use Medium level service.  Car Owner can use all
   services registered in CCIS master.  Table 1 shows an example of the
   service level configurations, in which each CCIS service is
   classified as three levels (High, Medium, Low), by considering the
   service features (Mission-critical or not) and the impact on overall
   CCIS system.

4.  Service flows

4.1.  Scenarios of Service Level High

   In this clause, we take a look at the service flow of the CCIS device
   registration.  The CCIS device must be registered with the CCIS
   master to provide services to the CCIS user, and Car Owner only
   process the device registration because device registration service
   is High Level Service.

   Figure 2 shows the service flow of CCIS device registration.  The
   CCIS master periodically broadcasts its general information to the
   prospective devices.  Then, a CCIS device transmits a notification
   message to the CCIS master and waits for a registration request.  The
   CCIS master now informs Car Owner of the discovery of a CCIS device.
   With a Device Registration Authentication message from Car Owner, the
   CCIS master sends a registration request message to CCIS device.  In
   response to the registration request message, the CCIS device sends
   its own profile information, such as identifier, a list of functional
   interaction it can provide, and a level of authority for the
   functional interaction.  Then, the CCIS master stores the information
   and informs the registration result to Car Owner.

4.2.  Scenarios of Service Level Medium

   In this clause, we take a look at the service flow of the shared
   device control.  A user who wants Device Control MUST first occupy
   the CCIS device.  Shared device control is a medium level service.
   So, private or public clients MUST obtain the permission of the car
   owner or temporary owner to occupy and control the shared device.
   Figure 3 shows the service flow of the shared device control by
   Private Client or Public Client, in which the authority check
   operations are added between master and owner to obtain a permission
   for device control.  After occupation, the CCIS user can control the
   CCIS device via CCIS master.  This procedure is discussed in the
   clause of scenarios of service level low.

4.3.  Scenarios of Service Level Low

   All CCIS users can control the low level personal CCIS devices
   without the permission of owner.  Figure 4 shows the service flow of
   Low Level device control service.  A user who want to control a CCIS
   device MUST requests the occupation of a specific CCIS device to the
   CCIS master.  Then, the CCIS master MUST check the user of the
   availability and status of the concerned device and respond the
   result.  If the occupation request is successfully performed, the
   user can send a control request message to CCIS master.  Based on
   this request, the CCIS master performs the device control operation
   and sends a feed back to the user.
