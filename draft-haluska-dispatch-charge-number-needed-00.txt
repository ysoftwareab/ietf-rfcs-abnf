Abstract

   This draft documents a need for the ability to signal a Charge Number
   using SIP, and identifies one deployed though not yet standard

2.   Problem Statement

   In the current PSTN in North America, a Charge Number is signaled
   with call originations.  The Charge Number identifies the customer or
   account with which the caller is associated.  In many cases it is the
   same as the Calling Party Number, while in others it is different -
   e.g. the main number for a business which has many individual calling
   numbers.  This might be needed for usage collection, but it also
   could influence call processing, especially when a particular type of
   service applies for any caller associated with a particular charge
   number.

   Services currently implemented in the PSTN including Operator
   Services and Directory Assistance make use of Charge Number in
   processing a call.  Such services are migrating to SIP based
   platforms, and the need to know the Charge Number still exists.  For
   example, branding may be based on the value of the Charge Number.

   There is currently no IETF standardized mechanism to convey the
   Charge Number in SIP.

   Current SIP-ISUP interworking standards do not specify a SIP mapping
   for the Charge Number parameter.  Thus, when interworking from ISUP
   to SIP, Charge Number is carried in an encapsulated ISUP message in a
   MIME body.  The P-Charge-Info header, if standardized, would be
   useful in this role.

   For SIP originated calls, there is no currently standardized way to
   carry this information.  The P-Charge-Info header, if standardized,
   would be useful in this role.

   [I-D.draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-07] proposes a "P-Charge-Info"
   SIP header for carrying charge information for a call.  It is
   intended to facilitate carrying information equivalent to Charge
   Number for SIP originated calls.  It is also intended to support PSTN
   interworking by carrying the ISUP Charge Number value.

3.  Conclusion

   Operator Services and Directory Assistance, which are migrating to
   SIP based platforms, have a continuing need to convey the Charge
   Number associated with a caller.  There is currently no standardized
   mechanism defined for conveying this information in SIP; such a
   mechanism is needed in order to provide these services.  The
   mechanism defined in [I-D.draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-07] fills
   this need.

5.  Security Considerations

   Disclosure of Charge Number information to unauthorized parties could
   reveal information about the caller's usage patterns.  It could also
   allow for the potential use of the Charge Number value by others
   either to interfere with billing, or to access unauthorized services.
   Thus, the Charge Number should not be disclosed to unauthorized
   parties, should not be accepted from unauthorized parties, and should
   not be modified by unauthorized parties.
