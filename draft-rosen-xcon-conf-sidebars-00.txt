Abstract

   This document discusses the creation, management of operation of
   sub-conferences in a centralized conferencing architecture, also
   known as "sidebars".  This work uses the SIP Conferencing Framework
   and builds on the descriptions of sub-conferences in that document.
   Examples of SIP and XCON protocols are given.

Internet-Draft                SIP Sidebars                      May 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document uses the concepts and definitions from the high level
   requirements [9] and the SIP conferencing framework [10] documents.

   While the SIP conferencing framework document describes both SIP and
   XCON methods for creating and managing a centralized conference, this
   document will assume a non-SIP method, as sidebars are an advanced
   conferencing application.  Examples of the non-SIP methods include
   the XCON protocols (used as examples) an  IVR, or a web page

2.  Sidebars and Dialogs

   Conference establishment using SIP dialogs is described in the SIP
   conferencing framework document.  The set of XCON protocols to also
   establish a conference is currently being developed and designed by
   the XCON working group.  Since the details are TBD, this document
   will refer to the protocol as CPCP (Conference Policy Control
   Protocol) and omit the details of the messages until they are
   developed.

   In SIP sessions, it is not uncommon to have a single dialog with
   multiple media sessions.  The SIP Conferencing Framework assumes this
   - that a participant uses the Conference URI to establish an INVITE
   dialog that results in the establishment of one or more media
   streams.  Media streams established using separate dialogs are
   usually assumed to be unrelated.  For example, a pair of SIP/PSTN
   gateways may have a number of dialogs established between them, and
   the resulting media streams represent separate calls or sessions.

   As a result, the simplest sidebar dialog model is to reuse the
   existing main conference dialog to establish the sidebar.  This has
   the advantage of allowing even the simplest endpoints which are
   incapable of any local mixing to participate in a conference with
   sidebars, provided a non-SIP method of controlling the conference is
   provided.

   It is also possible for a sidebar to have a separate dialog.
   However, the motiviation and advantages for this are not obvious.  As
   a result, this document will be restricted to the case of a single
   dialog and the reuse of that dialog for sidebars.

   Like a main conference, a sub-conference is identified by a URI.
   This URI is an alias for the main conference - that is, it must
   resolve to the same focus as the main conference.  If an intended
   sidebar participant is not a participant in the main conference, the
   intended participant joins the conference using the sidebar URI using
   normal SIP means and is added into the sidebar only.  If that

   participant wishes to become part of the main conference, either a
   re-INVITE with the main conference URI in the Contact is used, or an
   INVITE with Replaces from the main conference is issued.  Of course,
   if the participant wishes to maintain separate dialogs, a simple new
   INVITE would be sent to/from the main conference URI.

3.  Creating Sidebars

   The SIP conferencing architecture supports multiple media types and
   both centralized and distributed mixing.  Sidebars also have this
   same property.  The media type and mixing mode of a sidebar need not
   be the same as the main conference.

   In the simplest case, the sidebar has the same media types as the
   main conference, and is centrally mixed.  In this case, the focus
   changes the mix for the sidebar participants, and no SIP signaling is
   necessary - the existing main conference mix is replaced with the
   sidebar mix.

   On the other hand, if the sidebar has different media types than the
   main conference, then the focus will need to re-INVITE, adding the
   new media stream(s).  Non-SIP means will be used so that the User
   Agent renders the new media stream in the proper context to the user.

   For fully distributed mixing of single dialog sidebars, the focus may
   need to re-INVITE to add a media stream if the media stream is not
   already being sent to the participant.  The participant will be
   notified of the desired mix using a non-SIP protocol which will
   result in the creation of the sidebar.

4.  Adding Participants to a Sidebar

   Participants can be added to a sidebar in a number of ways.  If the
   intended sidebar participant is already a participant in the main
   conference and desires a single dialog, then some non-SIP means will
   be used to add the participant.

   On the other hand, if the participant is not in the main conference,
   a SIP means such as a REFER with the Refer-To URI set to the sidebar
   URI can be used, or a non-SIP means.  Either way, a new dialog will
   be established with the participant and they will join the sidebar.

   Participants who request multiple dialogs will be INVITEd to the
   sidebar, perhaps as a result of a REFER.  As above, a new dialog will
   be established with the participant, and they will join the sidebar.

5.  Terminating a Sidebar

   Participation in a single dialog sidebar is terminated by non-SIP
   means.  When the last participant leaves it, the sidebar ceases to
   exist.  A multiple dialog sidebar is terminated by a BYE on the
   dialog for each of the participants.  When the last participant
   leaves it, the sidebar ceases to exist, and the sidebar URI becomes

   another participant may join later.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses call control for SIP conferencing.  Both call
   control and conferencing have specific security requirements which
   will be summarized here.  Conferences generally have authorization
   rules about who may or may not join a conference, what type of media

   may or may not be used, etc.  This information is used by the Focus
   to admit or deny participation in a conference.  It is recommended
   that these types of authorization rules be used to provide security
   for a SIP conference.  For this authorization information to be used,
   the focus needs to be able to authenticate potential participants.
   Normal SIP mechanisms including Digest authentication and
   certificates can be used.  These conference specific security
   requirements are discussed further in therequirements and framework
   documents.

   For call control security, a user agent must maintain local policy on
   who is permitted to perform call control operations, initiate REFERs,
   and replace dialogs.  Normal SIP authentication mechanisms are also
   appropriate here.  The specific authentication and authorization
   schemes are described in the multiparty call control framework
   document.
