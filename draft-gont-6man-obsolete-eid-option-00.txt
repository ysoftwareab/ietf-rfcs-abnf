Internet-Draft        EID Option to Obsolete Status          August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Endpoint Identification option (hex value 0x8a) [EID-OPTION] was
   meant to be used with the Nimrod routing architecture [NIMROD-DOC],
   but has never seen widespread deployment.  Therefore, this document
   instructs IANA to change the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop
   Options" registry [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] accordingly, marking option
   0x8a as "Obsolete".

   with a reference to this RFC.
