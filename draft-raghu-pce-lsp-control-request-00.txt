    Ability for a stateful PCE to request and obtain control of LSP
               draft-raghu-pce-lsp-control-request-00.txt

Abstract

   The stateful PCEP extensions provide stateful control of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label
   Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where a PCC delegates
   control over one or more locally configured LSPs to a stateful PCE.
   There are use-cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to request and
   obtain control of one or more LSPs from a PCC.  This document
   describes a simple extension to stateful PCEP to achieve such
   objective.

1.  Introduction

   Stateful PCEP extensions [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set
   of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between
   and across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes
   mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions.  The
   stateful PCEP defines the following two useful network operations:

   o  Delegation: an operation in which a PCC temporarily grants the
      rights to modify one or more LSPs to a PCE, and such LSPs are
      referred to as delegated LSPs.

   o  Revocation: an operation in which a PCC revokes the previously
      granted rights to modify one or more LSPs from a PCE.

   Some network operators prefer head-end (PCC) based reactivity to
   network events (e.g., link failure).  For example, typically
   operators would like to reduce the time that backup LSP are being
   used for fast-reroute protection as the links that a backup LSP

   traverses may be congested when fast-reroute is active.  PCC based
   LSP failure detection and re-routing mechanisms enable operators to
   minimize the duration of such congestion and meet operational
   requirements/constraints.  As such, during normal operations, it may
   be preferable for PCC to have full control of its LSPs.  However,
   operators shall prefer to use PCE for planned events such as
   centralized optimization and placement of LSPs.  In this case, it is
   preferable for a PCE to obtain the control of one or more LSPs from a
   PCC, rather than waiting for the PCC to delegate the control.  Once
   the PCE completes its operation, it reliqushes the control of the
   LSPs.  Such capability enables operatirs to combine the benefits of
   both centralized and distributed control of TE LSPs to get the best
   of both worlds.

   This specification provides a simple extension using which a PCE can
   request control of one or more LSPs from any PCC over stateful PCEP
   channel.  The procedures for granting and relinquishing control of
   the LSPs are specified in accordance with the specification
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   PCRpt:  PCEP report message.

   PCUpd:  PCEP update message.

   PLSP-ID:  A PCEP-specific identifier for the LSP.

   The LSP object is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]  and
   included here for ease of reference.

                         Figure 1: The LSP Object

   A new flag, the "LSP Control Request Flag" (G), is introduced.  On a
   PCUpd message, a PCE sets the G Flag to 1 to indicate that it wishes
   to gain control of LSP(s).  A PLSP-ID of value other than 0 and
   0xFFFFF is used to identify the LSP for which the PCE requests
   control.  The PLSP-ID value of 0 indicates that the PCE is requesting
   control of all LSPs originating from the PCC.

4.  Operation

   During normal operation, a PCC that wishes to delegate the control of
   an LSP sets the D Flag to 1 in all PCRpt messages pertaining to the
   LSP.  The PCE confirms the delegation by setting D Flag to 1 in all
   PCUpd messages pertaining to the LSP.  The PCC revokes the control of
   the LSP from the PCE by setting D Flag to 0 in PCRpt messages
   pertaining to the LSP.  If the PCE wishes to relinquish the control
   of the LSP, it sets D Flag to 0 in all PCUpd messages pertaining to
   the LSP.

   If a PCE wishes to gain control over an LSP, it sends a PCUpd message
   with G Flag set to 1.  The LSP for which the PCE requests control is
   identified by the PLSP-ID.  The PLSP-ID of 0 indicates that the PCE
   wants control over all LSPs originating from the PCC.  If the LSP(s)
   is/are already delegated to the PCE, the PCC ignores the G Flag.  A
   PCC can decide to delegate the control of the LSP at its own
   discretion.  If the PCC grants or denies the control, it sends PCRpt
   message with D Flag set to 1 and 0 respectively in accordance with
   according with stateful PCEP [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] . If the PCC
   does not grant the control, the PCE may choose to retry requesting
   the control preferably using exponentially increasing timer.  A PCE
   ignores the G Flag on PCRpt message

   In case multiple PCEs request control over an LSP, and if the PCC is
   willing to grant the control, the LSP MUST be delegated to only one
   PCE chosen by the PCC based on its local policy.
