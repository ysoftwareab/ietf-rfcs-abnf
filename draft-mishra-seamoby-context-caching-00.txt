Abstract

The use of neighbor graphs as a method for dynamically caching the
context of mobile stations in front of the station's mobility path can
reduce the latency of handoff's between base stations or access points.
Neighbor graphs capture the set of all potential mobility paths for a
wireless network. Given any base station or access point, the set of all
possible hand-offs can easily be determined by examining the neighbor
graph in either a distributed fashion (at each base station) or
centralized at the AAA server. This draft describes how the neighbor
graph algorithm works at both the base station and the AAA server.

INTERNET-DRAFT               Context Caching            24 February 2003


1.  Introduction


In wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11, described in [IEEE80211], it
may be desirable to improve the speed at which a handoff can be
completed. A number of different approaches can be used to facilitate
the handoff process using RADIUS extensions as described in
[Arbaugh2003]. This draft describes the notion of neighbor graphs as one
possible approach.



The sequence of NASes contacted by clients as they move creates a graph
representing the mobility paths of the clients. We call this graph a
neighbor graph with NASes as the vertices and the mobility paths between
the NASes as the edges. Thus, the number of neighbors for a given NAS is
given by the degree function applied to the vertex representing the
given NAS, e.g. for NAS_A the number of neighbors would be given by
deg(v_A) where deg is the degree function- deg: V -> int. Through
knowledge of the neighbor graph, it is possible for the basestation or
RADIUS server to anticipate client movements and provide advance notice
of a potential handoff to the NAS. This advance notice can be provided
by the RADIUS extensions described in [Arbaugh2003]. This removes the
latency of the RADIUS exchange from the critical path for processing a
handoff, decreasing handoff latency substantially, as described in
[IEEE-02-758, IEEE-03-084]. Assuming that the coverage area is over-
lapping, this technique can support handoffs at vehicular velocities.
The creation and maintenance of neighbor graphs at an AS and basestation
is described in this document.





By nature, client behavior is not completely predictable, so that the
handoff advance notice is only advisory. The client identified in the
advance notice may never contact the NAS, or may contact it long after
the initial notice is received. As a result, the NAS will typically free
reserved resources after a suitable waiting period, known as the
Reservation-Lifetime. A client contacting the NAS after the Reservation-
Lifetime has expired will be unable to complete a handoff, and will need
to do a fast resume, such as is supported in EAP TLS [RFC2716].



The extension described in [Arbaugh2003] enables a RADIUS Server to send
Notify-Requests to NASes, and to receive Notify-Responses. The Notify-
Request identifies the session to be handed off.  If the NAS has



Mishra et. al.                                                  [Page 3]





INTERNET-DRAFT               Context Caching            24 February 2003


resources available to reserve, and if it is enabled to support this
handoff extension, then it will respond with a Notify-Accept.  If
resources are not available (such as when previous resource commitments
leave insufficient resources remaining), or if the NAS does not wish to
support the handoff for any other reason, the NAS will respond with a
Notify-Reject, specifying the reason why the requested handoff
reservation could not be carried out.



After the NAS responds with a Notify-Accept, it will typically issue an
Access-Request to the RADIUS server. This allows the NAS to obtain the
authorizations for the session before it is contacted by the client. The
contents of the Access-Request sent by the NAS will depend on the form
of access it is providing, so that it cannot be specified in detail
here. However, for use with IEEE 802.11, it is expected that an Access-
Request will be sent with a NAS-Port-Type=802.11 and a Service-
Type=Handoff. For other access methods, a different NAS-Port-Type value
might be sent, along with a different value for Service-Type.


1.1.  Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

Authenticator
           An Authenticator is an entity that require authentication from
           the Supplicant.  The Authenticator may be connected to the
           Supplicant at the other end of a point-to-point LAN segment or
           802.11 wireless link.

Authentication Server
           An Authentication Server is an entity that provides an
           Authentication Service to an Authenticator. This service
           verifies from the credentials provided by the Supplicant, the
           claim of identity made by the Supplicant.

Network Access Server (NAS)
           The device providing access to the network.

Service   The NAS provides a service to the user, such as IEEE 802 or
           PPP.

Port Access Entity (PAE)
           The protocol entity associated with a physical or virtual
           (802.11) Port.  A given PAE may support the protocol
           functionality associated with the Authenticator, Supplicant or
           both.



Mishra et. al.                                                  [Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT               Context Caching            24 February 2003


Session   Each service provided by the NAS to a user constitutes a
           session, with the beginning of the session defined as the
           point where service is first provided and the end of the
           session defined as the point where service is ended.  A user
           may have multiple sessions in parallel or series if the NAS
           supports that, with each session generating a separate start
           and stop accounting record. Where the client is mobile and is
           able to handoff between NASes, multiple related sessions may
           be uniquely identified by the Acct-Multi-Session-Id attribute.

Supplicant
           A Supplicant is an entity that is being authenticated by an
           Authenticator. The Supplicant may be connected to the
           Authenticator at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment or
           802.11 wireless link.

1.2.  Requirements language

In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements of
the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key words
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Neighbor Graph Creation and Maintenance

2.1.  Authentication Server



The creation of the neighbor graph is accomplished dynamically through
the course of operation of the area serviced by the AS. The series of
RADIUS messages, e.g. Accounting-Request(Start) and Access-Request
messages from the NAS, induces a neighbor graph. Through analysis of
these messages by the AS, the neighbor graph is easily created and
maintained.



When the attributes in a RADIUS message indicate that a session is
continuing from a previous NAS, the AS MUST create an edge from the
previous NAS to the new NAS in the neighbor graph. Each edge created
SHOULD have some method for removal of the edge such as a timeout, or
the use of a least recently used cache to ensure that 'outliers'
(outliers are those edges that are NOT mobility paths through the
network but are added due to discrete movements by the station) are
removed from the graph in a timely fashion.



Mishra et. al.                                                  [Page 5]





INTERNET-DRAFT               Context Caching            24 February 2003


2.2.  NAS



Neighbor graphs can also be computed locally at the NAS rather than
globally at the AS. In this case, the creation and maintenance of the
neighbor graph is similar to the process used at the AS, but is specific
to the link layer technology being used. In the case of wireless
networks such as those defined by the IEEE 802.11 specification
[IEEE80211], the NAS examines the REASSOCIATION-REQUEST frame to
determine the MAC address of the previous NAS. The NAS MUST now add an
edge from the previous NAS to itself. Once again, the NAS SHOULD have
some method for removal of the edge such as a timeout for reasons
described earlier.


3.  Usages of Neighbor Graphs


3.1.  Context Caching



Once one station has completed a high latency handoff, the mobility path
of the station is added to the neighbor graph as an edge. There after,
stations following that path can experience reduced latency. In the case
that the neighbor graph is resident with the AS, the RADIUS extensions
described in [Arbaugh2003] are used to notify the set of NASes to which
the station may roam, i.e. the neighbors. In the case where the neighbor
graph is resident with the NAS, context caching can be performed using a
NAS specific method such as the inter access point protocol (IAPP)
defined by the IEEE [IEEEIAPP].


3.2.  Management Information



While neighbor graphs are primarily focused on providing fast roaming
support via context caching, they can also provide insight into the
mobility patterns of stations at the local (NAS) or global (AS) level.
Because neighbor graphs are dynamic, they present a picture of the
current network that can depict the mobility topology of the network.

4.  Security considerations


Because context is being cached, the AS MUST ensure that a proper trust
relation exists between the NAS before context information is cached.


5.  IANA Considerations
