Abstract

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) search operation
  provides mechanisms for clients to request all user application
  attributes, all operational attributes, or attributes selected by
  their description.  This document extends LDAP to provide a mechanism
  for LDAP clients to request the return of all attributes of an object
  class.

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-zeilenga-ldap-adlist-03      1 November 2002


1.  Overview

  In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377], search
  operations [RFC2251] search operations support mechanisms for
  requesting sets of attributes.  This set is determined by a list of
  attribute descriptions.  Two special descriptors are defined to
  request all user attributes ("*") [RFC2251] and all operational
  attributes ("+") [OPATTRS].  However, there is no convenient mechanism
  for requesting pre-defined sets of attributes.

  This document extends LDAP to allow an object class identifier to be
  specified in search request attributes list to request the return all
  attributes allowed by object class.  A plus sign ("+", U+002B) is used
  to distinguish an object class identifier from an attribute
  descriptions.

  For example, the attribute list of "+country" is equivalent to the
  attribute list "c", "searchGuide", "description", and "objectClass"
  were requested.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2.  Return of all Attributes of an Object Class

  This extension allows object class identifiers is to be provided in
  the attributes field of the LDAP SearchRequest [RFC2251].  For each
  object class identified in the attributes field, the request is to be
  treated as if each attribute allowed by that class (by "MUST" or
  "MAY", directly or by SUPerior) was itself listed.

  If the object class identifier is unrecognized, it is be treated an an
  unrecognized attribute description.

  This extension redefines the attributes field of the SearchRequest to
  be a DescriptionList described by the following ASN.1 [X.680] data
  type:

       DescriptionList ::= SEQUENCE OF Description
       Description ::= LDAPString

  The Description is string conforming to the [ABNF]:

       Description = AttributeDescription | ObjectClassDescription.
       ObjectDescription = "+" ObjectClass *( ";" options )

  where <AttributeDescription> and <options> productions are as defined
  in Section 4.1.5 of [RFC2251] and an <ObjectClass> is an object
  identifier, in either <numericoid> or <descr> form [RFC2252], of an
  object class.

  ObjectDescription <options> are provided for extensibility.  This
  document only defines semantics of ObjectDescriptions with zero
  options in the attributes field of a SearchRequest.  Other uses may be
  defined in future specifications.

  Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object Identifier
  IANA-ASSIGNED as a value of the supportedFeatures [FEATURES] attribute
  in the root DSE.


3.  Security Considerations

  This extension provides a shorthand for requesting all attributes of
  an object class.  As these attributes which could have been listed
  individually, this short hand is not believed to raise additional
  security considerations.

  Implementors of this (or any) LDAP extension should be familiar with
  general LDAP security considerations [RFC3377].


4.  IANA Considerations

  Registration of the following values is requested in accordance with
  BCP 64 [RFC3383].


  4.1.  Object Identifier

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action an LDAP
  Object Identifier to identify the protocol feature described in this
  document.  The following registration template is suggested:

      Subject: Request for LDAP OID Registration
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
          Kurt Zeilenga <kurt@OpenLDAP.org>
      Specification: RFCxxxx
      Author/Change Controller: IESG
