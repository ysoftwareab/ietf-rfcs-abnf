              A Framework for L3VPN Performance Monitoring
                 draft-dong-bess-l3vpn-pm-framework-00

Abstract

   The performance monitoring (PM) of BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private
   Networks (L3VPN) is important for satisfying the Service Level
   Agreement(SLA) for critical network services.  Since L3VPN is
   essentially using a multipoint-to-point service model, flow
   identification becomes a big challenge for L3VPN PM.  This document
   specifies the framework and mechanisms for the application of PM in
   L3VPN.

1.  Introduction

   BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN) [RFC4364] is widely
   deployed to provide various services such as enterprise VPN, Voice
   over IP (VoIP), video, mobile backhaul, etc.  Most of these services
   are sensitive to packet loss and delay.  The capability to measure
   and monitor the performance metrics such as packet loss, delay, as
   well as related metrics is important for meeting the Service Level
   Agreements (SLA).  This performance measurement capability also
   provides operators with greater visibility into the performance

   characteristics of the services in their networks, and provides
   diagnostic information in case of performance degradation or failure
   and helps fault localization.

   In order to perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other
   metrics on a particular L3VPN flow, the egress PE needs to identify
   the ingress VRF sending the VPN packets.  As specified in
   [I-D.zheng-l3vpn-pm-analysis], such flow identification is a big
   challenge for L3VPN.

   This document specifies the framework and mechanisms for the
   application of performance monitoring in L3VPN.

2.  Flow Identification in L3VPN PM

   Based on the mechanisms defined in [RFC4364], for a specific VPN
   prefix, the directly connected PE would allocate and advertise the
   same VPN label to all the remote PEs which have the VPN Routing and
   Forwarding Tables (VRFs) of the same VPN.  Essentially this is a
   multipoint-to-point service model.  On the egress PE, performance
   monitoring can not be performed based on the VPN label, because it
   cannot identify the ingress VRF which generates the VPN packets.

   As analyzed in [I-D.zheng-l3vpn-pm-analysis], in order to perform the
   packet loss or delay measurement on a specific L3VPN traffic flow, it
   is critical that the egress PE can uniquely identify the ingress VRF
   of the received VPN packets.

   [I-D.bryant-mpls-synonymous-flow-labels] defines the concept of
   Synonymous Flow Labels (SFL), for which the typical use case is the
   performance monitoring of MPLS applications.  The Synonymous Flow
   Labels are used here for the performance monitoring of L3VPN, in
   which the SFLs are used by the egress PE to uniquely identify the
   ingress VRF of the received VPN packets.  Depends on specific
   provisioning models, the SFLs can be either local-allocated or
   globally allocated labels.  Subsequent sections specifies the data
   plane encapsulation and control plane considerations for different
   modes.

3.  Local-Allocated SFL for L3VPN PM

   This section specifies the L3VPN PM mechanism with local-allocated
   Synonymous Flow Labels, in which the SFLs are allocated by the egress
   PEs.  The SFL can be allocated to identify a specific ingress VRF, or
   a specific ingress-egress VRF pair.  Depends on the semantics of the
   SFL, two MPLS label stack encapsulations are used.

3.1.  Additional SFL for Source Identification

   This section specifies the label stack encapsulation in which the SFL
   is allocated by the egress PE to identify the ingress VRF and the
   ingress PE.  While the VPN label is still used for packet forwarding
   decision on the egress PE.

   When a VPN data packet is to be sent by an ingress PE, firstly the
   VPN label obtained from the BGP VPN route of the destination address
   prefix is pushed onto the label stack.  Then according to the next-
   hop of the BGP VPN route, the Synonymous Flow Label allocated by the
   next-hop PE for the ingress VRF SHOULD be pushed onto the label
   stack.  Finally, the MPLS tunnel label is pushed onto the label
   stack.  The TTL and TC fields of the VPN label and the tunnel label
   entries SHOULD be set according to the Pipe or Uniform Model as
   defined in [RFC3270] and [RFC3443].  The value of the TTL and TC
   fields of the VPN label entry SHOULD be copied to the TTL and TC
   fields of the Synonymous Flow Label entry respectively.  With this
   encapsulation, one additional label is carried in the label stack
   compared with traditional L3VPN encapsulation defined in [RFC4364].

   When the VPN packet arrives at the egress PE, the outermost tunnel
   label is popped (if present), then the egress PE uses the Synonymous
   Flow Label to identify the ingress VRF of the packet.  The TTL and
   COS fields SHOULD be processed according to the Pipe or Uniform
   Models defined in [RFC3270] and [RFC3443].  Since the value of the
   TTL and TC fields of the VPN label and the SFL are the same, the TTL
   and TC fields of the SFL can be ignored by the egress PE.

              | Tunnel Label |              |  Tunnel Label |

3.2.  Replacing the VPN Label with SFL

   This section specifies the label stack encapsulation in which the SFL
   is allocated by the egress PE to identify a specific ingress-egress
   VRF pair.  In this case, since the SFL could also be used by the
   egress PE to identify the egress VRF, if the VPN label is a per-

   instance label, on the ingress PE the VPN label can be replaced with
   the SFL, then the tunnel label is pushed onto the label stack.  The
   TTL and TC fields of the Synonymous Flow Label and the tunnel label
   SHOULD be set according to the Pipe or Uniform Model as defined in
   [RFC3270] and [RFC3443].  The value of the TTL and TC fields of the
   VPN label entry should be copied to the TTL and TC fields of the
   Synonymous Flow Label entry respectively.  With this mechanism, the
   depth of the MPLS label stack is not increased, while the number of
   Synonymous Flow Labels needed would be more than that in the
   mechanism of Section 3.1.

              +--------------+              +---------------+
              | Tunnel Label |              |  Tunnel Label |
              +--------------+        \     +---------------+
              |     VPN      |  -------\    |Synonymous Flow|
              |    Label     |          \   |     Label     |
              +--------------+  -------/    +---------------+
              |    Payload   |        /     |     Payload   |
              +--------------+              +---------------+

                  Figure 2.  VPN label replaced with SFL

   Note that this label stack encapsulation would require the egress PE
   to lookup the destination VPN prefix in the egress VRF before the
   packet can be forwarded to a specific CE.  This is similar to the
   per-instance VPN label allocation mechanism in [RFC4364].  The TTL
   and TC fields SHOULD be processed according to the Pipe or Uniform
   Model as defined in [RFC3270] and [RFC3443].  Since the VPN label
   entry is replaced with the Synonymous Flow Label, the TTL and TC
   fields of the SFL should be used as those of the VPN label entry in
   traditional L3VPN encapsulation.

4.  Global SFL for L3VPN PM

   In some scenarios global MPLS label can be beneficial for L3VPN
   services.  This section specifies the L3VPN PM mechanism with global
   Synonymous Flow Labels.

4.1.  Global SFL for VPN Identification

   In this mode, a global unique SFL is allocated for each VPN.
   Besides, a global unique label is allocated to identify each PE node
   in the network.  An ingress VRF can be identified by the combination
   of the PE label and the VPN SFL label.

   When a VPN data packet is to be sent by an ingress PE, firstly the
   VPN label obtained from the BGP VPN route of the destination address
   prefix is pushed onto the label stack.  Then the Synonymous VPN Label

   and the PE label are pushed onto the label stack.  Finally, the MPLS
   tunnel label is pushed onto the label stack.

   With this approach, two additional labels are carried in the label
   stack compared with traditional L3VPN encapsulation defined in
   [RFC4364].

                                            +---------------+
                                            |  Tunnel Label |
              +--------------+              +---------------+
              | Tunnel Label |              |Source PE Label|
              +--------------+        \     +---------------+
              |      VPN     |  -------\    | VPN Synonymous|
              |     Label    |          \   |   Flow Label  |
              +--------------+  -------/    +---------------+
              |    Payload   |        /     |   VPN Label   |
              +--------------+              +---------------+
                                            |    Payload    |
                                            +---------------+

          Figure 3.  Label stack with global PE label and VPN SFL

   In scenarios where the VPN label is per-instance label, the VPN
   Synonymous Flow Label can replace the VPN label, then the MPLS label
   stack would contain one additional label compared with traditional
   L3VPN encapsulation.

              +--------------+              +---------------+

              |     Label    |          \   +---------------+

             Figure 4.  VPN label replaced with global VPN SFL

4.2.  Global SFL for Ingress VRF Identification

   In this mode, a global unique SFL is allocated for each VRF on each
   PE, which can be used by the egress PE to identify both the ingress
   VRF and the ingress PE.

   When a VPN data packet is to be sent by an ingress PE, firstly the
   VPN label obtained from the BGP VPN route of the destination address

   prefix is pushed onto the label stack.  Then the VRF SFL is pushed
   onto the label stack.  Finally, the MPLS tunnel label is pushed.
   With this approach, one additional label is carried in the label
   stack compared with the traditional L3VPN encapsulation.

                Figure 5.  Label stack with global VRF SFL

   When the VPN packet arrives at the egress PE, the outermost tunnel
   label is popped (if present), then the egress PE uses the VRF
   Synonymous Flow Label to identify the ingress VRF of the packet.  The
   VPN label is used for packet forwarding decision on the egress PE.

5.  Control Plane

   This section describes the corresponding control plane mechanisms for
   L3VPN performance monitoring with the help of Synonymous Flow Label.

5.1.  VPN Membership Auto-Discovery

   Before the Synonymous Flow Labels are allocated, a PE which attaches
   to a particular VPN needs to know all the remote VRFs on other PEs
   that attach to the same VPN.  This is achieved via the BGP membership
   auto-discovery procedure.  Mechanisms similar to the membership auto-
   discovery of MVPN [RFC6513] can be used.  Detailed BGP protocol
   extensions will be specified in a companion document.

5.2.  Allocation of Synonymous Flow Label for L3VPN PM

   After the VPN membership information is obtained, Synonymous Flow
   Labels needs to be allocated for L3VPN PM.  The SFL can be either
   local-allocated by each PE, or it can be global unique label which is
   allocated for L3VPN PM.

Internet-Draft             L3VPN PM Framework               October 2015


5.2.1.  Local SFL Allocation

   With local label allocation, for each attached VPN, a PE SHOULD
   allocate unique Synonymous Flow Label for each remote VRF on its
   remote PEs.  Two label allocation methods can be used:

   1.  A Synonymous Flow Label is allocated for each remote VRF.  This
   SFL would be used by the egress PE to identify the ingress VRF of the
   received packet.

   2.  A Synonymous Flow Label is allocated for each remote-local VRF
   pair.  With this approach, the SFL can replace the VPN label in the
   MPLS label stack of L3VPN packet as specified in Section 3.2.

   With both methods, the allocated Synonymous Flow Label SHOULD be
   advertised to remote PEs via the L3VPN control plane, where some
   extensions to BGP is needed.  Detailed BGP protocol extensions will
   be specified in a future version.

5.2.2.  Global SFL Allocation

   With global label allocation, the SFLs are allocated by a network
   controller, which obtains the VPN membership information via the VPN
   membership auto-discovery.  Two global label allocation methods can
   be used:

   1.  A global SFL is allocated for each VPN.  The combination of this
   SFL and the global PE label can identify the ingress VRF of the
   received packets.

   2.  A global SFL is allocated for each VRF on each PE.  This SFL
   itself can identify the ingress VRF of the received packets.

   Detailed mechanisms about the global SFL allocation will be specified
   in a companion document.

6.  L3VPN Performance Monitoring

   Since the challenge of source identification in L3VPN is resolved,
   the procedures for the packet loss and delay measurement as defined
   in [RFC6374] can be applied to L3VPN performance monitoring.  Note
   that in L3VPN performance monitoring, the source and destination
   address TLV of the LM and DM messages SHOULD be set to the VPN-IPv4
   or VPN-IPv6 address, which begins with the 8-byte Route Distinguisher
   (RD) of the VRF and ends with a 4-byte IPv4 address or 16-byte IPv6
   address of the ingress or egress PE node.
