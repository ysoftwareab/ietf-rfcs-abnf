                 draft-song-yeti-testbed-experience-03

Abstract

   This document reports and discusses issues in DNS root services,
   based on experiences from the experiments in the Yeti DNS Project.
   These issues include IPv6-only operation, the root DNS server naming
   scheme, DNSSEC KSK rollover, root server renumbering, multiple root
   zone signer, and so on.  This project was founded in May 2015 and has
   since built a live root DNS server system testbed with volunteer root
   server and resolver operations.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC1034] says the domain name space is a tree structure.  The top
   level of the tree for the unique identifier system is served by the
   DNS root system.  It has been operational for 25+ years.  It is
   pivotal to making the current Internet useful.  So it is considered
   somewhat ossified for stability reasons.  It is hard to test and
   implement new ideas evolving to a more advanced level to counter
   challenges like IPv6-only operation, DNSSEC key/algorithm
   rollover[RFC4986], scaling issues, and so on.  In order to make the
   test more practical, it is also necessary to involve users'
   environments which are highly diversified, in order to study the
   effects of the changes in question.

   To benefit Internet development as a whole, the Yeti DNS Project was
   proposed to build a parallel, experimental, live IPv6 DNS root system
   to discover the limits of DNS root name service and deliver useful
   technical output.  Possible research agenda will be explored on this
   testbed, covering several aspects (but not limited to):

   o  IPv6-only operation

   o  DNSSEC key rollover

   o  Renumbering issues

   o  Scalability issues

   o  Multiple zone file signers

   Starting from May 2015, three coordinators began to build this live
   experimental environment and called for participants.  At the time of
   writing, there are 25 Yeti root servers with 16 operators, and
   experimental traffic from volunteers, universities, DNS vendors,
   mirrored traffic, non-Yeti traffic, and RIPE Atlas probes.

   Note that the Yeti DNS Project has complete fealty to IANA as the DNS
   name space manager.  All IANA top-level domain names will be
   precisely expressed in the Yeti DNS system, including all TLD data
   and meta-data[Root-Zone-Database].  Therefore, the Yeti DNS Project
   is never an "alternative root" in the usual sense of that term.  It
   is expected to inform the IANA community by peer-reviewed science as
   to future possibilities to consider for the IANA root DNS system.

   In order to let people know the technical activities in Yeti DNS
   Project, this document reports and discusses issues on root DNS
   services, based on experiences so far from the testbed construction
   and experiments in the Yeti DNS Project.

2.  Problem Statement

   Some problems and policy concerns over the DNS Root Server system
   stem from centralization from the point of view of DNS content
   consumers.  These include external dependencies and surveillance
   threats.

   o  External Dependency: Currently, there are 12 DNS Root Server
      operators for the 13 Root Server letters, with more than 500
      instances deployed globally.  Yet compared to the number of
      connected devices, AS networks, and recursive DNS servers, the
      number of root instances may not be sufficient.  Connectivity loss
      between one autonomous network and all of the IANA root name
      servers usually results in loss of not only global service but
      also local service within the local network, even when internal
      connectivity is perfect.

   o  Surveillance risk: Even when one or more root name server anycast
      instances are deployed locally or in a nearby network, the queries
      sent to the root servers carry DNS lookup information which
      enables root operators or other parties to analyze the DNS query
      traffic.  This is a kind of information leakage[RFC7626] which is
      to some extent not acceptable to some policy makers.

   People are often told that the current root system with 13 root
   servers is not able to be extended to alleviate the above concerns,
   because it is limited to 13 by the current DNS protocol[ROOT-FAQ].
   This restriction may be relaxed when EDNS is considered completely
   deployed and/or when the root system doesn't have to support IPv4
   anymore.

   There are some technical issues in the areas of IPv6 and DNSSEC,
   which were introduced to the DNS root server system after it was
   created.  Renumbering DNS root servers also creates some technical
   issues.

   o  IPv6-only capability: Currently some DNS servers which support
      both A and AAAA (IPv4 and IPv6) records still do not respond to
      IPv6 queries.  IPv6 introduces larger minimum MTU (1280 bytes) and
      a different fragmentation model[Fragmenting-IPv6].  It is not
      clear whether DNS can survive without IPv4 (in an IPv6-only
      environment), or what impact in IPv6-only environment introduces
      to current DNS operations especially in the DNS root server
      system.

   o  KSK rollover: Currently, IANA rolls the ZSK every six weeks but
      the KSK has never been rolled as of the writing.  Is RFC5011
      [RFC5011] widely supported by resolvers?  How about larger key

      size or different encryption algorithm?  Is the DNS packet size
      limitation (512 or 1280 bytes) should be respected during KSK
      rollover nowadays?  There are some issues still unknown.

   o  Renumbering issue: It is likely that root operators may change
      their IP addresses for root servers as well.  Currently resolver
      can use priming exchange [I-D.ietf-dnsop-resolver-priming] to
      update its memory in real time.  Or it may combine out-band way to
      periodically get the current list of NS server of Root.  However
      it is observed root renumbering is still a concern which need
      coordination and interference from human labor which deserves
      exploring for automation.

3.  Yeti Testbed and Experiment Setup

   To use the Yeti testbed operationally, the information that is
   required for correct root name service is a matching set of the
   following:

   o  a root "hints file"

   o  the root zone apex NS record set

   o  the root zone's signing key

   o  root zone trust anchor

   Although Yeti DNS Project publishes strictly IANA information for TLD
   data and meta-data, it is necessary to use a special hint file to
   replace the apex NS RRset with Yeti authority name servers, which
   will enable the resolves to find and stick to the Yeti root system.

   Below is a figure to demonstrate the topology of Yeti and the basic
   data flow, which consists of the Yeti distribution master, Yeti root
   server, and Yeti resolver:

   Figure 1.  The topology of Yeti testbed

3.1.  Distribution Master

   As shown in figure 1, the Yeti Root system takes the IANA root zone
   and performs minimal changes needed to serve the zone from the Yeti
   root servers instead of the IANA root servers.  In Yeti, this
   modified root zone is generated by the Yeti Distribution Masters
   (DM), which provide it to the Yeti root servers.

   The zone generation process is:

   o  DM downloads the latest IANA root zone at a certain time

   o  DM makes modifications to change from the IANA to Yeti root
      servers

   o  DM signs the new Yeti root zone with Yeti key

   o  DM publishes the new Yeti root zone to Yeti root servers

   While in principle this could be done by a single DM, Yeti uses a set
   of three DMs to avoid any sense that the Yeti DNS Project is run by a
   single organization.  Each of three DMs independently fetches the
   root zone from IANA, signs it and publishes the latest zone data to
   Yeti root servers.

   In the same while, these DMs coordinate their work so that the
   resulting Yeti root zone is always consistent.  There are two aspects
   of coordination between three DMs: timing and information
   synchronization.

3.1.1.  Yeti root zone SOA SERIAL

   Consistency with IANA root zone except the apex record is one of most
   important point for the project.  As part of Yeti DM design, the Yeti
   SOA SERIAL which reflects the changes of yeti root zone is one factor
   to be considered.

   Currently IANA SOA SERIAL number for root zone is in the form of
   YYYYMMDDNN, like 2015111801.  In Yeti root system, IANA SOA SERIAL is
   directly copied in to Yeti SOA SERIAL.  So once the IANA root zone
   has changed with a new SOA SERIAL, a new version of the Yeti root
   zone is generated with the same SOA SERIAL.

   There is a case of Yeti DM operation that when a new Yeti root server
   added, DM operators change the Yeti root zone without change the SOA
   SERIAL which introduces inconsistency of Yeti root system.  To avoid
   inconsistency, the DMs publish changes only when new IANA SOA SERIAL
   is observed.

   An analysis of IANA convention shows IANA SOA SERIAL change twice a
   day (NN=00, 01).  Since October 2007 the maximum of NN was 03 while
   NN=2 was observed in 13 times.

3.1.2.  Timing of Root Zone Fetch

   Yeti root system operators do not receive notify messages when IANA
   root zone is updated.  So each Yeti DM checks the root zone serial
   periodically.  At the time of writing, each Yeti DM checks to see if
   the IANA root zone has changed hourly, on the following schedule:

                         +-------------+---------+
                         | DM Operator | Time    |
                         +-------------+---------+
                         | BII         | hour+00 |
                         | WIDE        | hour+20 |
                         | TISF        | hour+40 |
                         +-------------+---------+

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   Note that Yeti DMs can check IANA root zone more frequently (every
   minute for example).  A test done by Yeti participant shows that the
   delay of IANA root zone update from the first IANA root server to
   last one is around 20 minute.  Once a Yeti DM fetch the new root
   zone, it will notify all the Yeti root servers with a new SOA serial
   number.  So normally Yeti root server will be notified in less than
   20 minute after new IANA root zone generated.  Ideally, if an IANA DM
   notifies the Yeti DMs, Yeti root zone will be updated in more timely
   manner.

3.1.3.  Information Synchronization

   Given three DMs operational in Yeti root system, it is necessary to
   prevent any inconsistency caused by human mistakes in operation.  The
   straight method is to share the same parameters to produce the Yeti
   root zone.  There parameters includes following set of files:

   o  the list of Yeti root servers, including:

      *  public IPv6 address and host name

      *  IPv6 addresses originating zone transfer

      *  IPv6 addresses to send DNS notify to

   o  the ZSKs used to sign the root

   o  the KSK used to sign the root

   o  the SERIAL when this information is active

   The operation is simple that each DM operator synchronize the files
   with the information needed to produce the Yeti root zone.  When a
   change is desired (such as adding a new server or rolling the ZSK), a
   DM operator updates the local file and push to other DM.  A SOA
   SERIAL in the future is chosen for when the changes become active.

3.2.  Yeti Root Servers

   In Yeti root system, authoritative servers donated and operated by
   Yeti volunteers are configured as a slave to the Yeti DM.  As the
   time of writing, there are 25 Yeti root servers distributed around
   the world, one of which use IDN as its name (see Yeti hint file in
   Appendix A).  As one of operational research goal, all authoritative
   servers are required to work in an IPv6-only environment.  In
   addition, different from the IANA root, Yeti root server only serve
   the Yeti root zone.  No root-servers.org zone and .arpa zone are
   served.

   Since Yeti is a scientific research project, it needs to capture DNS
   traffic sent to one of the Yeti root servers for later analysis.
   Today some servers use dnscap, which is a DNS-specific tool to
   produce pcap files.  There are several versions of dnscap floating
   around; some people use the VeriSign one.  Since dnscap loses packets
   in some cases (tested on a Linux kernel), some people use pcapdump.
   It requires the patch attached to this bug report
   [pcapdump-bug-report]

   System diversity is also a requirement and observed for current 25
   Yeti root server.  Here are the results of a survey regarding the
   machine, operation system and DNS software:

   o  Machine: 20 out of 25 root server operator are using a VPS to
      provide service.

   o  OS: 6 operators use Linux (including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
      ArchLinux). 5 operators use FreeBSD and 1 NetBSD.  And other
      servers are unknown.

   o  DNS software: 18 our of 25 root server use BIND (varying from
      9.9.7 to 9.10.3). 4 of them use NSD (4.10 and 4.15).  The other 2
      servers use Knot (2.0.1 and 2.1.0).  And one use Bundy (1.2.0)

3.3.  Yeti Resolvers and Experimental Traffic

   In client side of Yeti DNS Project, there are DNS resolvers with IPv6
   support, updated with Yeti "hints" file to use the Yeti root servers
   instead of the IANA root servers, and using Yeti KSK as trust anchor.
   The Yeti KSK rollover experiment is expected to change key often
   (typically every three months), it is required that resolver operator
   to configure the resolver compliant to RFC 5011 for automatic update.
   For Yeti resolver, it is also interesting to try some mechanism end-
   system resolvers to signal to a server about their DNSSEC key status,
   like [I-D.wessels-edns-key-tag] and
   [I-D.wkumari-dnsop-trust-management] mentioned.

   Participants and volunteers are expected from individual researchers,
   labs of universities, companies and institutes, and vendors (for
   example, the DNS software implementers), developers of CPE devices &
   IoT devices, and middle box developers who can test their products
   and connect their own testbed into Yeti testbed.  Resolvers donated
   by Yeti volunteers are required to be configured with Yeti hint file
   and Yeti DNSSEC KSK.  It is required that Yeti resolver can speak
   both IPv4 and IPv6, given that not all authoritative servers on the
   Internet are IPv6 capable.

   At the time of writing several universities and labs have joined us
   and contributed certain amount of traffic to Yeti testbed.  To
   introduce desired volume of experiment traffic, Yeti Project adopts
   two alternative ways to increase the experimental traffic in the Yeti
   testbed and check the functionality of Yeti root system.

   One approach is to mirror the real DNS query to IANA root system by
   off-path method and replay it into Yeti testbed; this is implemented
   by some Yeti root server operators.  Another approach is to use
   traffic generating tool such as RIPE Atlas probes to generate
   specific queries against Yeti servers.

4.  Experiments in Yeti Testbed

   The main goal of Yeti DNS Project is to act as an experimental
   network.  Experiments will be conducted on this network.  In order to
   make the findings that result from these experiments more rigorous,
   an experiment protocol is proposed.

   A Yeti experiment goes through four phases:

   o  Proposal.  The first step is to make a proposal.  It is discussed
      and if accepted by the Yeti participants then it can proceed to
      the next phase.

   o  Lab Test.  The next phase is to run a version of the experiment in
      a controlled environment.  The goal is to check for problems such
      as software crashes or protocol errors that may cause failures on
      the Yeti network, before putting onto the experimental network.

   o  Yeti Test.  The next phase actually running the experiment on the
      Yeti network.  Details of this will depend on the experiment.  It
      must be coordinated with the Yeti participants.

   o  Report of Findings.  When completed, a report of the findings of
      the experiment should be made.  It need not be an extensive
      document.

   In this section, we are going to introduce some experiments
   implemented and planned in the Yeti DNS Project.

4.1.  Root Naming Scheme

   In root server history, the naming scheme for individual root servers
   was not fixed.  Current IANA Root server adopt [a-m].root-servers.net
   naming scheme to represent 13 servers which are labeled with letter
   from A to M.  The authoritativeness is achieved by hosting "root-
   servers.net" zone in every root server.  One reason behind this



Song, et al.              Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 10]

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   naming scheme is that DNS label compression can be used to produce a
   smaller DNS response within 512 bytes.  But in Yeti testbed there is
   a chance to design and test alternative naming schemes to solve some
   issues with current naming scheme.

   o  Currently root-servers.net is not signed.  Kaminsky-like attacks
      are still possible for the the important information of Root
      server.

   o  The dependency to a single name(i.e..net) make the root system
      fragile in extreme case that all .net servers are down or
      unreachable but the root server still alive.

   Currently, there are two naming schemes proposed in Yeti Project.
   One is to use separate and normal domains for root servers
   (Appendix A).  One consideration is to get rid of the dependency on
   the single name.  Another consideration is to intentionally produces
   larger packets for priming responses for less name compression
   efficiency.  Note that the Yeti root has a priming response which is
   1031 Bytes as of the writing.

   There is also a issue for this naming scheme in which the priming
   response may not contain all glue record for Yeti Root servers.  It
   is documented as a technical findings [Yeti-glue-issue].  There are
   two approaches to solve the issue: one is to patch BIND 9 to includes
   the glue records in the additional section.  The other one is to add
   a zone file for each root server and answer for all of them at each
   Yeti server.  That means each Yeti root server would have a small
   zone file for "bii.dns-lab.net", "yeti-ns.wide.ad.jp", "yeti-
   ns.tisf.net", and so on.

   Another naming scheme under Yeti lab test is to use a special non-
   delegated TLD, like .yeti-dns for root server operated by BII.  The
   benefit of non-delegated TLD naming scheme are in two aspects: 1) the
   response to a priming query is protected by DNSSEC; 2) To meet a
   political reason that the zone authoritative for root server is not
   delegated and belong to particular companies or organizations except
   IANA; 3) reduce the dependency of root server names to other DNS
   service; 4) to mitigate some kind of cache poisoning activities.

   The obvious concern of this naming scheme is the size of the signed
   response with RRSIG for each root server and optionally DNSKEY RRs.
   There is a Lab test result regarding the different size of priming
   response in Octet : 1) with no additional data, with RRISG in
   additional section , with DNSKEY+RRSIG in additional section (7 keys
   in MZSK experiment.  MZSK is to be described in section 4.2)

             +--------------------+--------+----------------+

   We found that modification of IANA root zone by adding a new TLD is
   so controversial even for scientific purpose.  There are non-trivial
   discussions on this issue in Yeti discuss mailing list, regarding the
   proposal .yeti-dns for root name or .local for new AS112
   [I-D.bortzmeyer-dname-root].  It is argued that this kind of
   experiment should based on community consensus from technical bodies
   like IETF and be operated within a limited duration in some cases.

   Note that a document named "Technical Analysis of the Naming Scheme
   used for Individual Root Servers" is being developed in RSSAC Caucus.
   And it will be published soon

4.2.  Multiple-Signers with Multi-ZSK

   According to the Problem statement of Yeti DNS Project, more
   independent participants and operators of the root system is
   desirable.  As the name implies, multi-ZSK (MZSK) mode introduces
   different ZSKs sharing a single unique KSK, as opposed to the IANA
   root system (which uses a single ZSK to sign the root zone).  On the
   condition of good availability and consistency on the root system,
   the Multi-ZSK proposal is designed to give each DM operator enough
   room to manage their own ZSK, by choosing different ZSK, length,
   duration, and so on; even the encryption algorithm may vary (although
   this may cause some problem with older versions of the Unbound
   resolver).

4.2.1.  MZSK lab experiment

   In the lab test phase, we simply setup two root servers (A and B) and
   a resolver switch between them (BIND only).  Root A and Root B use
   their own ZSK to sign the zone.  It is proved that Multi-ZSK works by
   adding multiple ZSK to the root zone.  As a result, the resolver will
   cache the key sets instead of a single ZSK to validate the data no
   matter it is signed by Root A or Root B.  We also tested Unbound and
   the test concluded in success with more than 10 DMs and 10 ZSKs.

   Although more DMs and ZSKs can be added into the test, adding more
   ZSKs to the root zone enlarges the DNS response size for DNSKEY
   queries which may be a concern given the limitation of DNS packet
   size.  Current IANA root server operators are inclined to keep the
   packets size as small as possible.  So the number of DM and ZSK will




Song, et al.              Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 12]

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   be parameter which is decided based on operation experience.  In the
   current Yeti root testbed, there are 3 DMs, each with a separate ZSK.

4.2.2.  MZSK Yeti experiment

   After the lab test, the MZSK experiment is being conducted on the
   Yeti platform.  There are two phases:

   o  Phase 1.  In the first phase, we confirmed that using multiple
      ZSKs works in the wild.  We insured that using the maximum number
      of ZSKs continues to work in the resolver side.  Here one of the
      DM (BII) created and added 5 ZSKs using the existing
      synchronization mechanism.  (If all 3 ZSKs are rolling then we
      have 6 total.  To get this number we add 5.)

   o  Phase 2.  In the second phase, we delegated the management of the
      ZSKs so that each DM creates and publishes a separate ZSK.  For
      this phase, modified zone generation protocol and software was
      used [Yeti-DM-Sync-MZSK], which allows the DM to sign without
      access to the private parts of ZSKs generated by other DMs.  In
      this phase we roll all three ZSKs separately.

   The MZSK experiment was finished by the end of 2016-04.  Almost
   everything appears to be working.  But there have been some findings
   [Experiment-MZSK-notes], including discovering that IPv6 fragmented
   packets are not forwarded on an Ethernet bridge with netfilter
   ip6_tables loaded on one authority server, and issue with IXFR
   falling back to AXFR due to multiple signers which is described in
   [I-D.song-dnsop-ixfr-fallback] as a problem statement.

4.3.  Root Renumbering Issue and Hint File Update

   With the recent renumbering of H root Server's IP address, there is a
   discussion of ways that resolvers can update their hint file.
   Traditional ways include using FTP protocol by doing a wget and using
   dig to double-check the servers' addresses manually.  Each way would
   depend on manual operation.  As a result, there are many old machines
   that have not updated their hint files.  As a proof, after completion
   of renumbering in thirteen years ago, there is an observation that
   the "Old J-Root" can still receive DNS query traffic
   [Renumbering-J-Root].

   This experiment proposal aims to find an automatic way for hint-file
   updating.  The already-completed work is a shell script tool which
   provides the function that updates a hint-file in file system
   automatically with DNSSEC and trust anchor validation.
   [Hintfile-Auto-Update]




Song, et al.              Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 13]

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   The methodology is straightforward.  The tool first queries the NS
   list for "." domain and queries A and AAAA records for every name on
   the NS list.  It requires DNSSEC validation for both the NS list and
   the A and AAAA answers.  After getting all the answers, the tool
   compares the new hint file with the old one.  If there is a
   difference, it renames the old one with a time-stamp and replaces the
   old one with the new one.  Otherwise the tool deletes the new hint
   file and nothing will be changed.

   Note that in current IANA root system the servers named in the root
   NS record are not signed.  So the tool can not fully work in the
   production network.  In Yeti root system some of the names listed in
   the NS record are signed, which provides a test environment for such
   a proposal.

4.4.  DNS Fragments

   In consideration of new DNS protocol and operation, there is always a
   hard limit on the DNS packet size.  Take Yeti for example: adding
   more root servers, using the Yeti naming scheme, rolling the KSK, and
   Multi-ZSK all increase the packet size.  The fear of large DNS
   packets mainly stem from two aspects: one is IP-fragments and the
   other is frequently falling back to TCP.

   Fragmentation may cause serious issues; if one of the fragment is
   lost at random, it results in the loss of entire packet and involve
   timeout.  If the fragment is dropped by a middle-box, the query
   always results in failure, and result in name resolution failure
   unless the resolver falls back to TCP.  It is known at this moment
   that limited number of security middle-box implementations support
   IPv6 fragments.

   A possible solution is to split a single DNS message across multiple
   UDP datagrams.  This DNS fragments mechanism is documented in
   [I-D.muks-dns-message-fragments] as an experimental IETF draft.

4.5.  The KSK Rollover Experiment in Yeti

   The Yeti DNS Project provides a good basis to conduct a real-world
   experiment of a KSK rollover in the root zone.  It is not a perfect
   analogy to the IANA root because all of the resolvers to the Yeti
   experiment are "opt-in", and are presumably run by administrators who
   are interested in the DNS and knowledgeable about it.  Still, it can
   inform the IANA root KSK roll.

   The IANA root KSK has not been rolled as of the writing.  ICANN put
   together a design team to analyze the problem and make
   recommendations.  The design team put together a



Song, et al.              Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 14]

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   plan[ICANN-ROOT-ROLL].  The Yeti DNS Project may evaluate this
   scenario for an experimental KSK roll.  The experiment may not be
   identical, since the time-lines laid out in the current IANA plan are
   very long, and the Yeti DNS Project would like to conduct the
   experiment in a shorter time, which may considered much difficult.

   The Yeti KSK is rolled twice in Yeti testbed as of the writing.  In
   the first trial, it made old KSK inactive and new key active in one
   week after new key created, and deleted the old key in another week,
   which was totally unaware the timer specified in RFC5011.  Because
   the hold-down timer was not correctly set in the server side, some
   clients (like Unbound) receive SERVFAILs (like dig without +cd)
   because the new key was still in AddPend state when old key was
   inactive.  The lesson from the first KSK trial is that both server
   and client should compliant to RFC5011.

   For the second KSK rollover, it waited 30 days after a new KSK is
   published in the root zone.  Different from ICANN rollover plan, it
   revokes the old key once the new key become active.  We don't want to
   wait too long, so we shorten the time for key publish and delete in
   server side.  As of the writing, only one bug [KROLL-ISSUE]spotted on
   one Yeti resolver (using BIND 9.10.4-p2) during the second Yeti KSK
   rollover.  The resolver is configured with multiple views before the
   KSK rollover.  DNSSEC failures are reported once we added new view
   for new users after rolling the key.  By checking the manual of
   BIND9.10.4-P2, it is said that unlike trusted-keys, managed-keys may
   only be set at the top level of named.conf, not within a view.  It
   gives an assumption that for each view, managed-key can not be set
   per view in BIND.  But right after setting the managed-keys of new
   views, the DNSSEC validation works for this view.  As a conclusion
   for this issue, we suggest currently BIND multiple-view operation
   needs extra guidance for RFC5011.  The manage-keys should be set
   carefully during the KSK rollover for each view when the it is
   created.

   Another of the questions of KSK rollover is how can an authority
   server know the resolver is ready for RFC5011.  Two Internet-Drafts
   [I-D.wessels-edns-key-tag] and [I-D.wkumari-dnsop-trust-management]
   try to address the problem.  In addition a compliant resolver
   implementation may fail without any complain if it is not correctly
   configured.  In the case of Unbound 1.5.8, the key is only readable
   for DNS users [auto-trust-anchor-file].

4.6.  Bigger ZSK for Yeti

   Currently IANA root system uses 1024-bits ZSK which is no longer
   recommended cryptography.  VeriSign announced at DNS-OARC 24th
   workshop that the IANA root zone ZSK will be increased from 1024 bits



Song, et al.              Expires May 18, 2017                 [Page 15]

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   to 2048 bits in 2016.  However, it is not fully tested by the real
   environment.

   Bigger key tend to produce a larger response which requires IP
   fragmentation and is commonly considered harm for DNS system.  In
   Yeti DNS Project, it is desirable to test bigger responses in many
   aspects.  The Big ZSK experiment is designed to test operating the
   Yeti root with a 2048-bit ZSK.  The traffic is monitored before and
   after we lengthen the ZSK to see if there are any changes, such as a
   drop off of packets or a increase in retries.  The current status of
   this experiment is under monitoring data analysis.

5.  Other Technical findings and bugs

   Besides the experiments with specific goals and procedures, some
   unexpected bugs have been reported.  It is worthwhile to record them
   as technical findings from Yeti DNS Project.

5.1.  IPv6 fragments issue

   There are two cases in Yeti testbed reported that some Yeti root
   servers failed to pull the zone from a Distribution Master via AXFR/
   IXFR.  Two facts have been revealed in both client side and server
   side after trouble shooting.

   One fact in client side is that some operation system can not handle
   IPv6 fragments correctly and AXRF/IXFR in TCP fails.  The bug covers
   several OSs and one VM platform (listed below).

                +-----------------------+-----------------+
                | OS                    | VM              |
                +-----------------------+-----------------+
                | NetBSD 6.1 and 7.0RC1 | VMware ESXI 5.5 |
                | FreeBSD10.0           |                 |
                | Debian 3.2            |                 |
                +-----------------------+-----------------+

   Another fact is from server side in which one TCP segment of AXRF/
   IXFR is fragmented in IP layer resulting in two fragmented packets.
   This weird behavior has been documented IETF
   draft[I-D.andrews-tcp-and-ipv6-use-minmtu].  It reports a situation
   that some implementations of TCP running over IPv6 neglect to check
   the IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU value when performing MSS negotiation and when
   constructing a TCP segment.  It will cause TCP MSS option set to 1440
   bytes, but IP layer will limit the packet less than 1280 bytes and
   fragment the packet to two fragmented packets.

Internet-DraftExperiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNSNovember 2016


   While the latter is not a technical error, but it will cause the
   error in the former fact which deserves much attention in IPv6
   operation .

5.2.  Root name compression issue

   [RFC1035]specifies DNS massage compression scheme which allows a
   domain name in a message to be represented as either: 1) a sequence
   of labels ending in a zero octet, 2) a pointer, 3) or a sequence of
   labels ending with a pointer.  It is designed to save more room of
   DNS packet.

   However in Yeti testbed, it is found that Knot 2.0 server compresses
   even the root.  It means in a DNS message the name of root (a zero
   octet) is replaced by a pointer of 2 octets.  As well, it is legal
   but breaks some tools (Go DNS lib in this bug report) which does not
   expect such name compression for root.  Both Knot and Go DNS lib have
   fixed that bug by now.

5.3.  SOA update delay issue

   It is observed one server on Yeti testbed have some bugs on SOA
   update with more than 10 hours delay.  It is running on Bundy 1.2.0
   on FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE.  A workaround is to check DM's SOA status in
   regular base.  But it still need some work to find the bug in code
   path to improve the software.

Appendix A.  The Yeti root server in hint file

   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: Currently in Yeti testbed, there are cases
   that multiple servers run by single operator, like VeriSgin runs A
   and J.  It is allowed because we need more server to satisfy Yeti
   experiment requirement.  The name of those servers share common top
   domain name like yeti.eu.org, dns-lab.net, yeti-dns.net.  We
   intentionally pick two random labels (first 30 characters of
   SHA256([a-e])) to offset the effect of name compression.  According
   to the Yeti policy those servers will be reclaimed if qualified
   volunteers apply to host a Yeti server.
