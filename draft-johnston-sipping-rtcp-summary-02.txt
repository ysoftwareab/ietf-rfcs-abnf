Abstract

   This document discusses the motivation and requirements for the
   delivery of RTCP extended reports and other summary reports to
   non-participants in the session.  Several solution mechanisms are
   also discussed and compared.  A SIP events package is proposed as a
   solution.  An event package "rtcp-xr" is defined in this document
   along with some example call flows.

Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery             February 2004


1. Introduction

   There is a general need for real-time reporting of session quality in
   enterprise and service provider networks.  While the approach
   discussed in this document is quite general, this document is limited
   in scope to the delivery of particular RTCP summary reports.

   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [3] defines Sender Reports (SR) and
   Receiver Reports (RR) which are exchanged between the participants in
   a media session about the quality of the media session.  RTCP
   Extended Reports (XR) [4] have also been defined to provide
   additional quality information.  In particular, two summary reports
   are included: a statistics summary report and a VoIP (Voice over IP)
   metrics block.

   This summary information is of particular interest to certain parties
   who may not be participants in the media session.  For example, a
   service provider might be interested in logging a summary report of
   the QoS of a VoIP session.  Alternatively, an enterprise might want
   to compile a summary of the QoS of multimedia sessions established
   over a wide area network.

   In the case of a gateway or other high-density device, the device is
   likely to implement various AAA protocols and have the ability to log
   and export this type of RTCP summary reports.  However, this is not
   practical in smaller endpoints such as SIP phones, clients, or mobile
   phones.

   This document discusses the requirements of a mechanism to allow a
   third party which is not a participant in a session receive RTCP
   summary reports.  Three possible mechanisms are discussed at a very
   high level.

   The SIP events approach is found to be the best solution, and an
   event package is defined.  Some sample call flows are also included.

2. Requirements

   REQ-1: An authorized third party should be able to receive selected
   RTCP reports on a near real time basis.

   REQ-2: The client should not have to store large amounts of
   information.

   REQ-3: The client must be able to authenticate the third party.

   REQ-4: The RTCP report information must be able to be transferred
   securely.

Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery             February 2004


   REQ-5: A client participating in a bi-directional session will store
   and send RTCP summary reports for both directions.

   REQ-6: The reports will include or be associated with dialog
   identifiers for correlation purposes.

3. Possible Mechanisms

   Four possible mechanisms could be used implement these requirements:
   o  Forking RTCP to multiple locations,
   o  SNMP,
   o  Carrying RTCP information in a SIP header field or message body,
   o  Using an events package to delivery RTCP information.

3.1 Forking RTCP

   In general, one RTCP session is established per RTP media session.
   That is, if a session consists of a voice stream and a video stream,
   two separate RTCP sessions will be established in which the
   participants exchange QoS and other data.  The RTCP reports are sent
   to the same IP address as the RTP media but the next higher port
   number.  (There is also an extension [5] to SDP to explicitly list
   the RTCP IP address and port number.)

   While RFC3550 (RTP/RTCP) proposes multicasting RTCP sessions, what is
   missing is a mechanism for communicating correlation identifiers for
   purposes of determining which reports are associated with each other,
   particularly where source/dest IP/port are not globally unique.
   Also, there is not a means for establishing an association between
   the session participants and a collector.  In addition,
   authentication also not covered.

   An extension to send RTCP reports to multiple locations could be
   defined.  If this were implemented in an endpoint, the RTCP reports
   sent and received in a session could be sent to a third party which
   would listen on a particular IP address and port number.

   An obvious difficulty of this approach is how the third party would
   signal this IP address and port number to the endpoint during session
   setup.  A 3pcc could insert this extra information (in an SDP
   extension attribute) in the SDP at the time of call setup.  However,
   there is no good solution for the peer-to-peer model without forcing
   a proxy to act as a B2BUA and modify SDP.

   Another drawback is the lack of security in this approach.

   This approach would not require any extensions to SIP but may require
   extensions to SDP and RTCP for mechanisms to signal the transport IP

   address and port number of the third party.

3.2 SNMP

   Since this type of QoS monitoring seems related to management, SNMP
   could possibly be used to collect this type of data.  In general,
   SNMP may be used to manage the SIP user agent - the phone, soft phone
   or gateway.  However, the information available in RTCP summary
   reports is of less interest to the management of the UA and more of
   interest to the VoIP service provider.  In many cases, separate
   entities will be involved.  For example, an enterprise may manage
   their own SIP phones using SNMP, but a service provider provides SIP
   and gateway services.  It is unlikely a service provider will have
   SNMP privileges and may not be able to manage NAT/firewall traversal,
   etc.  For these reasons, SNMP is not a good fit for this "service
   level" management function.

   The next two approaches are closely coupled to SIP, which overcomes
   the disadvantages of the non-SIP approaches.

3.3 SIP Header Field or Message Body

   In this approach, the desired RTCP reports could be carried in a SIP
   [6] request or response message which would then be available to
   proxies which had Record-Routed the dialog.  For example, summary
   RTCP reports could be carried in a BYE message at the end of the
   session.  Since the requirement is to make the information available
   to intermediary third parties, the information would best be carried
   in a header field rather than a message body.  The compact nature of
   the binary encoded reports would not rule out inclusion in a header
   field.

   The main disadvantage of this approach is that any third parties
   would need to Record-Route in order to receive the reports.  Also, if
   the header field were only transported in an S/MIME encrypted message
   body, the information would not be available to the intermediaries.
   Finally, while the inclusion of this information at the end of a
   session in a BYE seems a good choice, there is no good candidates for
   mid-session delivery of this information (INFO would NOT be a good
   choice for this) although a re-INVITE could be used.

3.4 SIP Event Package

   In this approach, a new SIP events package [6] would be defined.  A
   third party could subscribe to the participant to receive
   notifications of RTCP reports transported using the NOTIFY method.

   An advantage of this approach is that the third party does not need



Johnston, et al.        Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery             February 2004


   to be a proxy that has Record-Routed a particular dialog.  The
   SUBSCRIBE request from the third party can use any of the set of
   standard SIP authentication mechanisms to authorize the third party.
   In addition, the reports transported using NOTIFY can use TLS or S/
   MIME to secure the transport of the report data.

   During the establishment of the subscription, the third party could
   request the type and frequency of RTCP reports.  The event package
   could also define the rate limitations.

   The subscription could either be for a particular dialog, in which
   the subscription would expire at the termination of the session.  The
   third party could then subscribe to the dialog package to receive
   notifications whenever the endpoint began a new session, providing
   the third party the information about the session sufficient to make
   a decision as to whether to subscribe to the RTCP report package for
   this particular dialog.  Alternatively, the subscription could be
   temporally bound in which the third party would receive notifications
   from all dialogs until the subscription expired.

   A disadvantage of this approach is that that the endpoint must manage
   the subscription and support SIP events and the RTCP report event
   package.  A third party wishing to receive reports from multiple
   endpoints would need to manage multiple subscriptions.

4. Event Package Formal Definition

4.1 Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [2].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

   "rtcp-xr"

   OPEN ISSUE: Should a more general name be used so that different
   message bodies can be defined to carry different session information?

4.2 Event Package Parameters

   The event package parameter "threshold" if present indicates that the
   subscriber wishes to receive mid-session threshold reports.  That is,
   if the quality of the session degrades beyond a locally configured
   value during a session, the notifier should send a NOTIFY message.

   If the event package is not present, the default is not to send the
   threshold reports, but to send a single NOTIFY at the end of each
   media session.

Internet-Draft           RTCP Summary Delivery             February 2004


   OPEN ISSUE: Is this the best way to do this or should a filter
   message body be defined?

   OPEN ISSUE: Ideally, the threshold value could be negotiated during
   the establishment of the subscription, but this seems hard.

4.3 SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   No SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

4.4 Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

4.5 NOTIFY Bodies

   There are two notify bodies:  a general report and a threshold
   report. The general report is used for periodic, mid-call reporting
   and end of call reporting.    The general report can include both
   local and remote metrics.

   The threshold report is used when call quality degrades. The general
   report is also included in the alert report to provide all of the
   necessary diagnostic information.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [7].

   OPEN ISSUE:  The message body should probably be a MIME type.

   General Report Event:

         VQEvent  =  LocalMetrics CLRF

   This alert indicates that the quality of the call in progress has
   degraded to an unacceptable level. In this case, the packet loss rate
   was 5%, the packet discard rate (due to jitter) was 2%, there were no
   bursts, the gap loss/discard rate was 2%, the round trip delay was
   160mS, the end system delay was 140mS, the R factor was 85, the
   MOS-LQ 3.6, the MOS-CQ 3.5.  In this case, the remote metrics were
   unavailable and therefore not included.

5. Call Flow Examples

   This section shows a number of call flow examples showing how the
   event package works.

   These flows assume that the summary report collector is notified by
   the registrar when a new User Agent registers which supports the
   event package.

   OPEN ISSUE: The ways in which this can be done should probably be
   discussed in the document.

5.1 End of Session Notification Call Flow

6. Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.

7. Contributors

   The authors would like to thank Dave Oran and Tom Redman for their
   discussions.
