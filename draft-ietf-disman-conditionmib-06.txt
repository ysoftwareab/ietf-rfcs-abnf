2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   0    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   0    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   0    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   0    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB.


3. Introduction

   The scope of this MIB is targeted for network operators responsible 
   for managing the operations of network resources. This document 
   contains an alarm reporting control (ARC) MIB module, which provides 
   a mechanism for a manager to suppress or defer the reporting of alarm 
   conditions based on the resource ID and alarm condition type.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


4.  ARC MIB Overview

   There is a need to provide a mechanism for controlling the reporting 
   of alarm conditions of resources in a network device. For example, 
   (a) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource until 
   the resource is problem-free, (b) inhibiting the reporting of alarm 
   conditions of a resource for a specified time period, or 
   (c) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource 
   indefinitely until explicitly allowed by the managing system at a 
   later time. 

   The alarm reporting control (ARC) feature provides an automatic 
   in-service provisioning capability. It allows sufficient time for 
   service setup, customer testing, and other maintenance activities in 
   an "alarm-free" state. Once a resource is "problem-free", 
   alarm reporting can be automatically or manually turned on 
   (i.e., allowed).

   By putting a network resource in ARC mode, (i.e., in nalm, nalmTI,  
   nalmQI, or nalmQICD states, as described in the MIB), the technicians  
   and managing systems will not be flooded with unnecessary work items 
   during operations activities such as service provisioning and 
   network setup/teardown. This will reduce maintenance costs and 
   improve the operation and maintenance of these systems.
   Putting a network resource in ARC mode shall not affect the 
   availability of active alarm condition information for potential
   retrieval.

   ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3] provides the 
   business requirements, analysis, and design of the Alarm Reporting 
   Control feature. 

   This document defines the SNMP objects to support a subset of 
   the ARC functions described in M.3100 Amd3. In particular, it defines
   a table that can be used to specify the ARC settings for the resources 
   in a system.

   The ARC MIB defined in this document provides a way to control the 
   reporting of alarm conditions. A set of applicable alarm conditions is 
   defined in ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 [M.3100] and is named 
   "probable causes". These probable causes (alarm conditions) have
   been included in the IANAItuProbableCause TC in the Alarm MIB [RFCzzzz].
-- RFC Ed.: replace zzzz with the actual RFC number of the Alarm MIB
--          document and remove this notice.
   The ARC MIB defines an IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero TC which
   can take any value of IANAItuProbableCause or 0.
   The ARC MIB further uses IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero to define the ARC 
   settings for the managed resource in the network elements.
   Specification of objects for defining and storing alarms, including 
   active and history alarms, standing and transient alarms, and alarm
   notifications are out of the scope of this document. 

4.1 Relationship between ARC mode and alarm reporting

   When the ARC mib is used in a managed system, the following rules
   apply:

   For alarm condition raised prior to entering ARC mode, reporting 
   of alarm raised and alarm cleared will be sent as usual. 
	
   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and also 
   cleared before exiting ARC mode, no reporting of alarm raised will 
   be sent and no reporting of alarm cleared will be sent.

   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and not cleared 
   when exiting ARC mode, the reporting of alarm raised will be 
   deferred until the moment of exiting ARC mode. The reporting of 
   alarm cleared will be sent as usual (i.e., at the time of alarm 
   cleared).

   Further details of the ARC function can be found in M.3100 Amd3
   [M.3100 Amd3].

4.2 This document requires the allocation of a single object identifier
   beneath the mib-2 subtree for its module identity.

  DESCRIPTION
    "A table of Alarm Reporting Control (ARC) settings on the system.

     Alarm Reporting Control is a feature that provides an automatic 
     in-service provisioning capability.  Alarm reporting is turned 
     off on a per-resource basis for a selective set of potential  
     alarm conditions to allow sufficient time for customer testing 
     and other maintenance activities in an 'alarm free' state.
     Once a resource is ready for service, alarm reporting is 
     automatically or manually turned on. 

     Defined in M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3], there are five 
     ARC states: alm, nalm, nalmQI, nalmQICD and nalmTI.
        
        alm:        Alarm reporting is turned on (i.e., is allowed).
        nalm:       Alarm reporting is turned off (i.e., not allowed).
        nalmQI:     nalm - Qualified Inhibit. Alarm reporting is 
                    turned off until the managed entity is qualified 
                    problem-free for a specified persistence interval.
        nalmQICD:   nalmQI - Count down. This is a substate of nalmQI 
                    and performs the persistence timing countdown 
                    function when the managed entity is qualified 
                    problem-free.
        nalmTI:     nalm - Timed Inhibit. Alarm reporting is turned 
                    off for a specified time interval. 
 
     alm may transition to nalm, nalmQI, or nalmTI by management request.
	
     nalm may transition to alm, nalmQI, or nalmTI by management request.

     nalmQI may transition to nalm or alm by management request.

     nalmQI may transition to alm automatically 
             if qualified problem-free (if nalmQICD is not supported) or 
             if the CD timer expired (if nalmQICD is supported)
		
     nalmTI may transition to alm or nalm by management request.

     nalmTI may transition to alm automatically if the TI timer expired.

     Further details of ARC state transitions are defined in Figure 3 
     of M.3100 Amd3 [M.3100 Amd3]."

  DESCRIPTION
    "This object controls the alarm reporting of a resource.  A manager 
     can set the arcState to either nalm, nalmQI, or nalmTI.
        
	nalm:     Alarm reporting is turned off.
	nalmTI:   Alarm reporting is turned off for a time interval.
		  (TI - Time Inhibit).
	nalmQI:   Alarm reporting is turned off for a specified
                  alarm type until the resource is qualified 
                  problem-free for an optional time interval.
		  Problem-free means that the condition corresponding
		  to the specified alarm type does not exist 
                  (i.e., cleared).
		  (QI - Qualified Inhibit).
	nalmQICD: This is a substate of nalmQI and performs the 
		  persistence timing count down function after the 
		  resource is qualified problem-free. 
		  (CD - Count Down).
	
     According to the requirements in M.3100 Amd3, a resource 
     supporting the ARC feature shall support the alm state and at 
     least one of the nalm, nalmTI, and nalmQI states. nalmQICD 
     is an optional substate of nalmQI.

     Note that the state alm (alarm reporting is allowed) is not listed
     in the enumeration of the value of this object. However, this state
     is implicitly supported by the mib.
     Once a resource enters the normal reporting mode (i.e., in the alm 
     state) for the specified alarm type, the corresponding
     row will be automatically deleted from the arc table.
     Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be achieved through
     setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'. 

     The nalamQICD state is a transitional state from nalmQI to alm. It
     is optional depending on the resource type and the implementation of the 
     the resource.  If it is supported, before the state transitions 
     from nalmQI to alm, a count down period is activated for a duration 
     set by the object arcNalmCDTimeInterval.  When the time is up, 
     the arcState transitions to alm."

  DESCRIPTION
    "This variable indicates the time remaining in the nalmTI state

     Similarly at the moment the resource enters the nalmQICD state, 
     this variable will have the initial value equal to the value of 
     arcNalmCDTimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by.

     This variable is read-create and thus will allow the manager to write
     (extend or shorten), as needed, the remaining time when the resource  
     is in the nalmTI or nalmQICD state.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for GET and/or SET operations in a 
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative 
   effect on network operations. A mischief maker will probably try to 
   switch the alarm system off in the first place. Further, one would 
   not want any mischief maker to know that the alarm system is switched 
   off. 

   The ARC setting feature defined in the MIB affects alarm notification 
   generation. Unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause 
   omission of alarm notifications or flooding of unwanted alarm 
   notifications from the netowrk. Thus access to objects in this MIB 
   must be very carefully regulated. These write-able objects (defined 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create) are:
   arcMIBTITimeInterval, arcMIBCDTimeInterval, arcState,
   arcNalmTimeRemaining, arcRowStatus, and arcStorageType.

   So, it is important to control the GET/SET access to these objects 
   and possibly even encrypt the object values when sending them over the 
   network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such 
   a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model (VACM) RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   Note that the arc Table is indexed by resource ID. In order to
   prevent leaking of resource instance IDs, VACM should be used and
   correctly configured.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
