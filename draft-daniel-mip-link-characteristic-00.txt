Abstract

   This document introduces a new model for link characteristic
   information that is sent by the mobile node to let the correspondent
   node know which link is being used for communication between them.
   This utility allows the correspondent node to forward its ongoing
   traffics within the bandwidth of the mobile node while the mobile
   node changes its link.  This model can be applicable for Mobile IPv4
   as well as Mobile IPv6.

Internet-Draft    Link Characteristic Infomation for MIP      April 2005


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IP [RFC3344], [RFC3775] allows an IP node to be mobile when
   changing its location and still maintain existing connections.  When
   the mobile node changes its location, it might also change its link.
   After attaching to a new link, the mobile node sustains its
   connection with the previous node (called correspondent node)
   continuously via specific operation as binding update which sent by
   the mobile node that is away from home to update another node with
   its new address (care-of address).

   Mobile Nodes are more and more equipped with several interfaces of
   different L2 technologies.  As such they may be reachable through
   multiple links at the same time or alternatively use each interface
   depending on the network environment.  Mobile IP scheme, however,
   does not provide which link is attached to the mobile node, but
   maintain its existing connection.  It means the correspondent node
   recognize that the mobile node is still attached to the same link.
   It can cause some trouble to communicate between them.  For example,
   in some case (i.e.,vertical handover), if the mobile node is attached
   to the CDMA (low bandwidth link) from the 802.11b Wireless LAN (high
   bandwidth link), the mobile node needs to receive a traffic within
   its limited bandwidth not overwhelmed traffic from the correspondent
   node, however the correspondent node will send its traffic to the
   mobile node as if the 802.11b bandwidth is still guranteed.  Ratio of
   packet loss will eventually be increased.

   This document introduces a new model for link characteristic
   information that is sent by the mobile node to let the correspondent
   node know which link is being used for communication between them.  A
   new option called Link Characteristic Information Option is defined
   in this document to provide link characteristic information (i.e.,
   current link bandwidth, link type, and others information will be
   expanded later if required) to the mobile node while doing a binding
   update.  This option is recommendable to be included in the Binding
   Update Message as well as Binding Acknowledgement Message when
   attaching to a new link which is different from the previous link.

   In wireless environment, all link is not able to support the same
   bandwidth to the mobile node while attaching to the new link.  If the
   mobile node which is currently attached to the 802.11b link is being
   moved to the new 802.11b link, the available link bandwidth is may
   different between them.  So link characteristic information can be
   adoptable for the same link change including new extended messages.

   To illustrate this model easily, Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775]is only
   described in this document, Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] will be able to be
   defined following the Type-Length-Value format for Mobile IP

   Extension.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Link Characteristic Information Option for Mobile IPv6

   The Mobile Node Link Characteristic Information Option is a new
   optional data field that is carried in the Mobile IPv6 defined
   messages which includes the mobility header (Binding Update and
   Binding Acknowledgement).  Various type and bandwidth of link can be
   delivered to the correspondent node from the mobile node.  The
   subtype field in the option defined the specific link type and
   current bandwidth of the mobile node.

   This option is recommendable to be carried in the Binding Update and
   Binding Acknowledgement message while changing its subnet.  The
   subtype field in the option is used to interpret the specific link
   type and link current bandwidth of the mobile node.

      ----------------------------------------------

   o Link Characteristic Information: A variable length of link
   available bandwidth as specified link type by the subtype field of
   this option.

   This option does not have any alignment requirements.

4.  Operational Considerations

   The binding cache is a table maintained by each correspondent node
   and home agent that contains the current bindings for mobile nodes.

   To store link characteristic information on the correspondent node,
   one entry SHOULD be contained in the binding cache.  Also the
   correspondent node MUST recognize this option.  Otherwise, this
   option is silently discarded by the correspondent node.

   Link characteristic information MUST be provided by the mobile node
   while attaching a new link via Binding Update message.  When the
   correspondent node sends Binding Acknowledgement message, Link
   Characteristic Information Option which is copied from the Binding
   Update message MUST be included.

   Once taking an available bandwidth of the mobile node, the
   correspondent node SHOULD guarantee the bandwidth when forwarding the
   traffics to the mobile node.  For example, The ongoing traffic
   requires 10Mbps bandwidth, but the available bandwidth of the mobile
   node is at most 1Mbps, then the correspondent node SHOULD reduce its
   forwarding traffic amount.

   In vertical handover, the mobile node can be moved to various links
   such as wireless pan area, wireless lan are and cellular area and
   each link has its own specific cnaracteristic information.  This
   option can be more valuable model for vertical handover environment
   than horizontal handover.

   This document only define the bandwidth information as link
   characteristic, but there is no restriction to add other available

   information which will be newly defined as new subtype and link
   characteristic information when anyone requires a specific
   information.

5.  Security Considerations

   Attacker can use this option to reduce the current bandwidth
   regardless of link type of the mobile node.  Several mechanisms can
   be adoptable for this vulnerability.

   Encrypting traffic at link layer such that other users on the same
   link do not see the link characteristic information.  This mechanism
   does not help against attackers on the rest of the path between the
   mobile node and the correspondent node.

   Encrypting the whole packet, such as when using IPsec to protect the
   communications with the correspondent node [RFC3776].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should record a value for Link Characteristic Option including
   subtype (Mobile IPv4 Extension and Mobile IPv6 Option.

7.  Acknowledgements

   2004 is referred to illustrate what Mobile IPv6 is in this document.
