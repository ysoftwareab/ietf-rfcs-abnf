                Internet Group Management Protocol MIB 
    
    
    
1. Introduction 
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet 
   Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [17], version 2 [18] or 
   version 3 [19]. This version of the MIB is an update to rfc2933 
   incorporating IGMPv3 changes to enable "source filtering" in routers
   and hosts.  All of this MIB module is applicable to IPv4 multicast 
   routers; a subset is applicable to hosts implementing IGMP.  Since 
   IGMP is specific to IPv4, this MIB does not support management of 
   equivalent functionality for other address families, such as IPv6.  
   Such management may be supported by other MIBs. 
    
2. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
     . An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571]. 
    
     . Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in 
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [1], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 
        2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7]. 
    
     . Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the 
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and 
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is 
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and 
        RFC 2574 [12]. 
    
     . Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol 
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
        [13]. 
    
     . A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] 
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 
        2575 [15]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

                Internet Group Management Protocol MIB 
    
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
   the MIB. 
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB module contains three tables: 
    
     1. the IGMP Interface Table which contains one row for each 
        interface on which IGMP is enabled, 
    
     2. the IGMP Cache Table which contains one row for each IP 
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular 
        interface, and 
     3. the IGMP SrcList Table which contains one row for each entry in 
        the source filter record for an interface and multicast group 
        pair. 
      
   All tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers, but 
   some columnar objects in the first and second tables apply only to 
   routers.

5. Security Considerations 
    
   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information 
   related to multicast sessions.  Some of these objects could contain 
   sensitive information.  In particular, the igmpCacheSelf and 
   igmpCacheLastReporter can be used to identify machines which are 
   listening to a given group address.  There are also a number of 
   objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read- 
   create, which allow an administrator to configure IGMP in the 
   router. 
    
   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively 
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause 
   a denial of service.  Hence, the support for SET operations in a 
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative 
   effect on network operations. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the 
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, 
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to 
   access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give 
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have 
   legitimate rights to access them.
