Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use
   with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it defines managed objects for the Forwarding and Control
   Element Separation (ForCES) Network Element (NE).  The ForCES working
   group is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to
   control the behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE).

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The ForCES MIB module is a read-only MIB module that captures
   information related to the ForCES protocol ([RFC3654], [RFC3746],
   [forces-applicability-draft] and [forces-protocol-draft]).

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].

   The ForCES MIB module does not include information that is specified
   in other MIB modules, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.

   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB module relative
   to associations that are up includes:

   o  identifiers of the elements in the association,

   o  configuration parameters of the association, and

   o  statistics of the association.


3.  ForCES MIB Definition

   The MIB module contains the latest ForCES protocol version supported
   by the CE (forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported).  Note that the CE
   must also allow interaction with FEs supporting earlier versions.

   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the
   following associated information is provided by the MIB module as an
   entry (forcesAssociationEntry) in the association table
   (forcesAssociationTable):

   o  Version number of the ForCES protocol running in this association
      (forcesAssociationRunningProtocolVersion).

   o  Time when the association entered the UP state
      (forcesAssociationTimeUp).

   o  Time when the association left the UP state
      (forcesAssociationTimeDown).  Note that this is only used for
      notification purposes as the association is removed from the MIB
      immediately after it leaves the UP state.

   o  Number of ForCES Heartbeat messages sent from the CE
      (forcesAssociationHBMsgSent) and received by the CE
      (forcesAssociationHBMsgReceived) since the association is UP.

   o  Number of other ForCES messages sent from the CE
      (forcesAssociationOtherMsgSent) and received by the CE
      (forcesAssociationOtherMsgReceived) since the association is UP.
      Only messages other than Heartbeat, Association Setup, Association
      Setup Response, and Association Teardown are counted.

   Finally, the MIB module defines the following notifications:

   o  Whenever an association enters the UP state, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryUp) is issued containing the version of the
      ForCES protocol running.  Note that as CE ID and FE ID are
      indexes, they appear in the OID of the ForCES-protocol running-
      version object.

   o  Whenever an association leaves the UP state, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryDown) is issued containing all associated
      information for this association.  The reason is that the
      association and all its associated information will be removed
      from the MIB immediately after this notification has been issued.

4.  Associations kept in the MIB

   Only associations that are UP are reflected in this MIB module.
   Associations enter the UP state as soon as the CE has sent to the FE
   an Association Setup Response message containing a successful
   Association Setup Result.

   Associations are removed from the MIB module as soon as they leave
   the UP state, i.e., if the CE has not received any message (Heartbeat
   or other protocol message) from the FE within a given time period or
   if an Association Teardown message has been sent by the CE.


5.  Support for multiple CEs and FEs

   An NE consists of one or more FEs and one or more CEs.  Where there
   is a single CE, that CE will have knowledge of all the associations
   in the NE and so can provide the information necessary to support the
   managed objects defined in this MIB module.  Where there is more than
   one CE, information about the associations may be distributed among
   the CEs.  Whether each CE implements the managed objects for the
   associations of which it is aware or whether the CEs cooperate to
   present the appearance of a single set of managed objects for all the
   associations in the NE is outside the scope of this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate

   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         forcesMIB         { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.


8.  Changes from Previous Draft Revisions

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): Prior to RFC
   publication of this document, the RFC Editor is asked to remove this
   entire section titled "Changes from Previous Draft Versions".

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-03.  They are small fixes to the
   text and the MIB module:

   o  Added MIB boilerplate according to
      http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html

   o  Clarified terminology with respect to MIB module and MIB managed
      objects.

   o  Added RFC Editor note to indicate RFC number for version 1 of
      ForCES protocol under ForcesProtocolVersion.

   o  Renumbered elements in forcesAssociationEntry starting with 1.

   o  Changed ForcesProtocolVersion from INTEGER to Integer32.

   o  Added forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported into the mandatory
      forcesMibGroups conformance group.

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                      July 2006


   o  Explicitely added the forcesStatsGroup to the forcesMibCompliance
      compliance statement as optional.

   o  Moved the MIB Definition section to the front.

   o  Rephrased IANA Considerations section according to RFC 4181
      Section 3.5.2.

   o  Added RFC Editor note to remove the "Changes from Previous Draft
      Revisions" section prior to publication.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-02.  They are refinements of the
   MIB module:

   o  Changed forcesAssociationCEID and forcesAssociationFEID from read-
      only to not-accessible to conform with Section 7.7 in [RFC2578].

   o  Removed forcesAssociationCEID and forcesAssociationFEID from the
      notifications.  This information is conveyed in the OID anyway.

   o  Added MIB conformance information.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-01.  The changes are in response
   to the Working Group Last Call:

   o  Addition of two traps/notifications to signal the associations
      that enter or leave the UP state.

   o  Suppression of the DOWN and ESTABLISHING states.  Only
      associations in the UP state are kept in the table.

   o  Split of the Message counters into Heartbeat and other messages.

   o  Addition of the current running version of ForCES protocol for
      each association in the UP state.

   o  Addition of the latest version of the ForCES protocol supported by
      the CE.
