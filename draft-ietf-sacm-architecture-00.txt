1.  Introduction

   Several data models and protocols are in use today that allow
   different applications to perform the collection, acquisition and
   assessment of posture.  These applications can vary from being
   focused on general system and security management to specialized
   configuration, compliance and control systems.  With an existing
   varied set of applications, there is a strong desire to standardize
   data models, protocols and interfaces to better allow for the
   automation of such data processes.

   This document describes an architecture to enable standardized
   collection, acquisition, and verification of Posture and Posture
   Assessments.  The architecture will include the components and
   interfaces that can be used to better identify the Information Model,
   type(s) of transport protocols needed for communication, and further,
   provide a model from which requirements can be drawn.

   This document uses terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

2.  Architectural Overview

   At a high level, the architecture describes 'How' and 'Where'
   information and assessment of posture may be collected, processed or
   assessed.  The core components are shown in Figure 1.  Three main
   functional components are defined: a Posture Assessment Information
   Consumer (C), a Posture Assessment Information Provider (P) and a
   Control Plane (CP) used to facilitate some of the security functions
   such as authentication and authorization and other metadata
   functions.

                        Simple Architectural Model

   The functional components in the proposed architecture are further
   described in this section.

2.1.  Posture Assessment Information Consumer

   As described in Section 2.2 of the SACM Use Cases
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases], several usage scenarios are posed with
   different application types requesting posture assessment



Cam-Winget, et al.       Expires April 16, 2015                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2014


   information.  Whether it is a configuration verification system, a
   checklist verification system, or a system for detecting posture
   deviations, compliance or vulnerabilities, they all need to acquire
   information about Posture Assessment.  Thus, the architectural
   component to enable such requests is defined as a Posture Assessment
   Information Consumer (C or Consumer).

   The Consumer defines the capabilities and functions that must be
   handled in order to facilitiate a Posture Assessment Information
   Request.  Requests can be either for a single posture attribute or a
   set of posture attributes where those attributes can be the raw
   information or an evaluated or assessed state based upon that
   information.  The Consumer may further choose to query for the
   information directly (one-time query), or to request for updates to
   be provided as the Posture Assessment Information changes
   (Subscription).  A request could be made directly to an explicitly
   identified Posture Assessment Information Provider (P or Provider),
   but a Consumer may also desire to obtain the information without
   having to know the available providers.

   There may be instances where a Consumer may be requesting information
   from various Providers and due to its policy or application
   requirements may need to be better informed of the Providers and
   their capabilities.  In those use cases, a Consumer may also request
   to discover the respective capabilities of those Providers.

   The Control Plane (described below) must authorize a Consumer to
   acquire the information it is requesting.  The Consumer may also be
   subject to limits or constraints on the numbers, types, sizes, and
   rate of requests.

2.2.  Posture Assessment Information Provider

   The Posture Assessment Information Provider (P or Provider) is the
   component that contributes Posture Assessment Information either
   spontaneously or in response to a request.  A Provider can be a
   Posture Evaluator, Posture Collector, or an application that has
   aggregated Posture Assessment Information that can be shared.

   The Provider defines the capabilities and functions that must be
   handled to share or provide Posture Assessment information.  A
   Provider may provide the information spontaneously, or in response to
   a direct request from a Consumer.  The information may be filtered or
   truncated to honor the request either by the Consumer's request, or
   the Providers's ability to filter (or provide only a subset of the
   requested information) or due to security considerations (e.g.
   authorization restrictions due to domain segregation, privacy, etc.).




Cam-Winget, et al.       Expires April 16, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2014


   The Provider may only be able to share the Posture Assessment
   Information using a specific data model and protocol.  It may use a
   standard data model and/or protocol, a non-standard data model and/or
   protocol, or any combination of standard and non-standard data models
   and protocols.  It may also choose to advertise its capabilities
   through a metadata abstraction.

   The Provider must be authorized to provide the Posture Assessment
   Information and further, be authorized to do so with the specific
   data models and protocols.

2.3.  Control Plane

   The Control Plane may be an abstracted component but is distinctly
   defined as a component to execute on some of the security functions
   and overall system functions.  Some of the functions include:

   Authentication:  with use cases where Consumers may request
    information independent of knowing the identities of the Providers
    and Providers may want to share the information unsolicited, the
    architecture must account for an abstraction where a control plane
    or a broker may be defined to affect the authentication of the
    Consumers and Providers independent of the actual information
    sharing communication channel.

   Authorization:  to address security for how Posture Assessment
    Information is shared between the Consumers and Providers, at
    minimum a management function to define those policies are needed.
    However, with the introduction of the control plane with use cases
    where R's may request information independent of knowing the
    identities of the P's and Providers (P's) wanting to share the
    information unsolicited, the architecture must account for an
    abstraction where a control plane or a broker may be defined to
    affect the authentication of the R's and P's independent of the
    actual information sharing communication channel.

   Identity Management:  As typically, Identity Management for
    authentication and authorization policies are best defined through a
    centralized component, the Control Plane also provides those
    services.

   Discovery/Registration:  a discovery mechanism is required to
    facilitate the interaction of Providers that may have different
    Posture Assessment Information and potentially limited (or a rich
    set) of ways in which they can share the information; that is,
    through the discovery mechanism Consumers can have visibility of the
    Providers present and the type(s) of Posture Assessment Information
    that is available and how it can be requested.  Similarly, a



Cam-Winget, et al.       Expires April 16, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2014


    Provider may need to register its "capability" for the Posture
    Assessment Information it can share and how it can share it (e.g.
    protocol or with filtering capabilities).  Enabling this function
    through a broker or control plane also allows for the distinct
    definition of security considerations (e.g. authorized registration
    of capabilities and of Providers) beyond how a Provider may define
    its own capability.

   The Control Plane also helps define how to manage an overall SACM
   system that allows for Consumers to obtain the desired Posture
   Assessment Information without the need to distinctly know and
   establish a one (Consumers) to many (Provider) connections.  Note
   that the Control Plane also allows for the direct discovery and
   connection between a Consumer and Provider.

2.4.  Interfaces between Consumers, Providers and Control Plane

   As shown in Figure 1, communication can proceed with the following
   interfaces and expected functions and behaviors:

   A:  interface "A" shown in Figure 1 demonstrates the ability and
    desire for Consumers and Providers to be able to communicate
    directly when a Provider is sharing Posture Assessment Information
    directly to a Consumer.  The interface allows for the different data
    models and protocols to be used between a Consumer and a Provider
    with the expectation that the appropriate authentication and
    authorization mechanisms have been employed to establish a secure
    communication link between the Consumer and the Provider.
    Typically, it is expected that the secure link establishment occurs
    as a management or control function through the abstracted control
    plane component (e.g. the control plane could be a proxy or could be
    embedded in a Consumer or a Provider).

   B:  interface "B" shown in Figure 1 handles the management and
    control functions that are needed to establish, at minimum, a secure
    communication between Consumers and Providers.  The interface must
    also handle the functions to allow for the discovery and
    registration of the Providers as well as the ways in which Posture
    Assessment Information can be provided (or requested).

   C:  interface "C" shown in Figure 1 enables Providers to share their
    Posture Assessment Information spontaneously; similarly, it enables
    Consumers to request information without having to know the
    identities (or reachability) of all the Providers that can fulfill
    Consumers' requests.

3.  Example mapping to SACM Architecture

   SACM's focus is on the automation of collection, verification and
   update of system security configurations pertaining to endpoint
   assessment.  In order to carry out these tasks, the architectural
   components shown in Figure 1 can be further refined as:

   Posture Assessment Information Provider:  a Provider may be dedicated
    to perform either the collection, aggregation or evaluation of one
    or more posture attributes whose results can be conveyed to a
    Posture Assessment Information Consumer.  In this example form of
    the SACM architecture model, these are shown as Collection,
    Evaluation and Results Providers.  Note that there may be posture
    attributes or posture assessment information that articulates
    Guidance information which may or many not be present in the
    architecture.

   Posture Assessment Information Consumer:  a Consumer may request or
    recieve one or more posture attributes or posture assessment
    information from a Posture Assessment Information Provider for their
    own use.  In this example form of the SACM architecture model, these
    are shown as Collection, Evaluation and Results Consumers.  Note
    that there may be posture attributes or posture assessment
    information that articulates Guidance information which may or many
    not be present in the architecture to be Provided or Consumed.

   Repositories:  a Repository stores one or more posture attributes or
    assessments for endpoints.  It should be understood that these
    repositories interface directly to a Provider or Consumer (and
    Guidance) but the interfaces used to interact between them is
    outside the scope of SACM (e.g. no interface arrows are shown in the
    architecture).

   Figure 2 illustrates an example flow for how posture information may
   flow.
