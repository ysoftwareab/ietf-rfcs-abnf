Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                 October 2006


   The user of DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of all features
   provided by SCTP and its extensions, especially support of

   o  multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking.

   o  multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.

   o  unordered delivery.

   o  partial reliable data transfer.

Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                 October 2006


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in RFC DTLS [8], over the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in RFC2960 [4] and
   RFC3309 [5].

   TLS is designed to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
   protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is
   currently mainly being used on top of the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP), as defined in RFC0793 [1].

   TLS over SCTP as described in RFC3436 [6] has some serious
   limitations:

   o  It does not support the unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   o  It does not support partial reliablility as defined in RFC3758
      [7].

   o  It only supports the usage of the same number of streams in both
      directions.

   o  It uses a TLS connection for every bidirectional stream, which
      requires a substantial amount of resources and message exchanges
      if a large number of streams is used.

   DTLS over SCTP as described in this document overcomes these
   limitations of TLS over SCTP.  The user of DTLS over SCTP can use all
   services provided by SCTP and its paritial reliability extension.
   The dynamic modification of the IP-addresses used by the SCTP enp-
   points is alos supported.

   The method described in this document requires that the SCTP
   implementation supports the optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP
   user messages and the SCTP authentication extension defined in SCTP-
   AUTH [9].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Association:  An SCTP association.

   Connection:  A TLS connection.

   Session:  A TLS session.

   Stream:  A unidirectional stream of an SCTP association.  It is
      uniquely identified by a stream identifier.

1.3.  Abbreviations

   DTLS:  Datagram Transport Layer Security

   MTU:  Maximum Transmission Unit

   SCTP:  Stream Control Transmission Protocol

   TCP:  Transmission Control Protocol

   TLS:  Transport Layer Security


2.  Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD.
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119 [2].


3.  DTLS considerations

3.1.  Message fragmentation

   The DTLS layer MUST NOT perform message fragmentation.  The SCTP
   layer will perform this task.  Thus the supported maximum length of
   SCTP user messages MUST be at least 2^14 + 2048 + 5 = 18437 bytes.
   Every DTLS message MUST be handled as one user message for SCTP.

3.2.  Message sizes

   DTLS imposes an limit in the user message size.  This limit applies
   also to DTLS/SCTP.

3.3.  Replay detection

   Replay detection of DTLS MUST not be used.

3.4.  Changing of Cipher Specs

   Whenever Cipher Specs are changed a new shared secret MUST be derived
   from the master secret and used for SCTP-AUTH.  The shared key
   identifier used by SCTP-AUTH MUST be incremented.


4.  SCTP considerations

4.1.  Stream usage

   All DTLS control messages MUST be transported on stream 0 with
   unlimited reliability and with the ordered delivery feature.

   User data messages MAY be transported over stream 0 but users SHOULD
   use other streams for better performance.

4.2.  Chunk handling

   The DATA, SACK and FORWARD-TSN chunks of SCTP MUST be sent in an
   authenticated way as described in SCTP-AUTH [9].  Other chunks MAY be
   sent in an authenticated way.

   This makes sure that an attacker can not modify the stream a message
   is sent in or affect the ordered/unordered delivery of the message.
   It is also not possible for an attacker to drop messages and use
   forged FORWARD-TSN and SACK chunks to hide this dropping.

4.3.  Handling of endpoint-pair shared secrets

   The endpoint-pair shared secret for Shared Key Identifier 0 is empty.
   After DTLS cipher specs are changed, a 64 byte shared secret is
   derived from the master secret and used a the new end-point pair
   shared secret.  The shared Key identifier MUST be incremented by 1.
   If it is 65535, the next value MUST be 1.  The next version of the ID
   will specify how the shared secret is derived from the master secret.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions from IANA.
