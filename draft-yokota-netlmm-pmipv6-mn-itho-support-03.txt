                 Virtual Interface Support for IP Hosts
           draft-yokota-netlmm-pmipv6-mn-itho-support-03.txt

Abstract

   A Virtual Interface is a software semantic internal to the host
   operating system.  This semantic is widely available in all popular
   operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.
   The Virtual Interface support is also required on the mobile node
   operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
   mobility features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming and
   flow mobility support.  This document explains the operational
   details of Virtual Interface construct and the inter-working with the
   network elements in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for supporting
   various network-based mobility management features.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility protocol.
   Some of the key goals of the protocol include support for
   multihoming, inter-technology handoffs and flow mobility support.
   The network elements in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain allow the mobile
   node to attach to the network using multiple interfaces, or perform
   handoff between different interfaces of the mobile node.  However,
   for supporting these features, the mobile node is required to be
   activated with specific software configuration that allows the mobile
   node to either perform inter-technology handoffs between different
   interfaces or attach to the network using multiple interfaces.  This
   document analyses from the mobile node's perspective a specific
   approach that allows the mobile node to leverage these mobility
   features.  Specifically, it explores the use of Virtual Interface
   support, a semantic available on all operating systems, for this
   purpose.

   A Virtual Interface is a software semantic internal to the operating
   system.  This semantic is widely available in all popular operating
   systems.  Many applications such as Mobile IP client [RFC3775], IPsec
   VPN client [RFC4301] and L2TP client [RFC3931] all rely on this
   semantic for their protocol implementation and the same semantic can
   also be useful in this context.  Specifically, the mobile node in the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain [RFC5213] can use virtual interface
   configuration for leveraging multihoming, inter-technology handoffs
   and flow mobility features provided by the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
   The rest of the document provides the operational and implementation
   details of Virtual Interface on the mobile node and the inter-working
   between the mobile node using virtual interface and network elements
   in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for supporting various network-based
   mobility management features.

3.  Virtual Interface Operation

   On most operating systems, a network interface is associated with a
   physical device that provides the capability for transmitting and
   receiving network packets.  In some cases a network interface can
   also be implemented as a logical interface which does not feature any
   packet transmission or receive capabilities, but relies on other
   network interfaces for such capabilities.  This logical interface is
   also known as a virtual interface.

                Figure 1: Virtual Interface Implementation

   From the perspective of the IP stack and the applications, a virtual
   interface is just another interface.  A host does not see any
   difference between a virtual and a physical interface.  All
   interfaces are represented as software objects to which IP address
   configuration is bound.  However, the virtual interface have some
   special properties which are essential for enabling various features.
   Following are those properties:

   o  Virtual interface is a logical interface that appears to the host
      stack as any other interface.  IP address configuration can be
      bound to this interface by configuring one or more IPv4 and/or
      IPv6 addresses to this interface.

   o  Virtual interface has a relation to a set of physical interfaces
      on the host.  These physical interfaces in the context of virtual
      interface are known as sub-interfaces.  These sub-interfaces
      provide transmit and receive functions for sending and receiving
      packets over physical links.  A virtual interface can receive
      packets sent to any of its sub-interfaces.

Internet-Draft   Virtual Interface Support for IP Hosts       March 2010


   o  The link-layer identifier of the virtual interface is used in the
      link-layer header of the IP packets sent through this interface,
      and the link-layer address of the physical interface will not be
      used.

   o  The send/receive vectors of a virtual interface are managed
      dynamically and are tied to the sub-interfaces.  The mapping
      between this virtual interface and the sub-interfaces can change
      dynamically and this change will not be visible to the
      applications.  The side effect of this is the ability for the
      application bound to the address configuration on the virtual
      interface, to survive across inter-technology handoffs.
      Applications will survive across the mapping change between a
      virtual interface and its sub interfaces.

   o  An IPv6 link as seen by the applications that the virtual
      interface is being part of through specific sub interface(s), when
      changed to be as part of through a different set of sub
      interface(s), will not trigger session loss, address loss, as long
      as the IPv6 prefix is valid, and the host continues to receives
      Router Advertisements [RFC4861] from the IP routers to the virtual
      interface over the sub-interface(s).

   o  The host has the path awareness of an IPv6 link, through a sub-
      interface and is driven by the host routing table, which uses the
      sub-interfaces for packet forwarding.  Addresses from Prefix P1,
      P2 tied to the virtual interface, may have two different link
      paths, Prefix P1 over E0, Prefix P2 over E1, and this mapping may
      be reversed, without applications being aware of, and with the
      needed path changes on the network side.

4.  Virtual Interface Use-cases in Proxy Mobile IPv6

   This section explains how the virtual interface support on the mobile
   node can be used for enabling some of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
   features.

4.1.  Multihoming Support

   A mobile node in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain can potentially attach
   to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, simultaneously through multiple
   interfaces.  Each of the attachment links are assigned a unique set
   of IPv6 prefixes.  If the host is configured to use virtual interface
   over the physical interface through which it is attached, following
   are the related considerations.

   o  The mobile node detects the advertised prefixes from the MAG1 and
      MAG2 as the onlink prefixes on the link to which the virtual
      interface is attached.

   o  The mobile node can generate address configuration using stateless
      auto configuration mode from any of those prefixes.

   o  The applications can be bound to any of the addresses bound to the
      virtual interface and that is determined based on the source
      address selection rules.

   o  The host has path awareness for the hosted prefixes based on the
      received Router Advertisement messages.  Any packets with source
      address generated using HNP_1 will be routed through the interface
      if_1 and for packets using source address from HNP_2 will be
      routed through the interface if_2.

4.2.  Inter-Technology Handoff Support

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol enables a mobile node with multiple
   network interfaces to move between access technologies, but still
   retaining the same address configuration on its attached interface.
   The protocol enables a mobile node to achieve address continuity
   during handoffs.  If the host is configured to use virtual interface
   over the physical interface through which it is attached, following
   are the related considerations.

                Figure 3: Inter-Technology Handoff Support

   o  When the mobile node performs an handoff between if_1 and if_2,
      the change will not be visible to the applications of the mobile
      node.  It will continue to receive Router Advertisements from the
      network, but from a different sub-interface path.

   o  The protocol signaling between the network elements will ensure
      the local mobility anchor will switch the forwarding for the
      advertised prefix set from MAG1 to MAG2.

   o  The MAG2 will host the prefix on the attached link and will
      include the home network prefixes in the Router Advertisements
      that it sends on the link.

4.3.  Flow Mobility Support

   For supporting flow mobility support, there is a need to support
   vertical handoff scenarios such as transferring a subset of prefixes
   from one interface to another.  This scenario is defined in
   [I-D.jeyatharan-netext-pmip-partial-handoff].  The mobile node can
   support this scenario by using the virtual interface support.  This
   scenario is similar to the Inter-technology handoff scenario defined
   in Section 4.2, only a subset of the prefixes are moved between
   interfaces.

Appendix A.  Virtual Interface Implementation Guidelines

   Most of the current operating systems support tools for setting up
   virtual interface at the mobile node such as NET:Bridge and interface
   bonding drivers, which are available on Linux operating system.  Some
   network equipment venders such as Intel, HP, also provide tools for
   setting up the virtual interface.

   The flowing sections are guidelines of some specific implementations.

A.1.  Linux Bonding Driver

   The Linux bonding driver provides a method for aggregating multiple
   network interfaces into a single logical bonded interface.  The
   behavior of the bonded interfaces depends upon the modes such as high
   availability or maximum throughput mode.

   There are two methods for configuring bonding: with support from the
   distro's network initialization scripts, and without.  Distros
   generally use one of two packages for the network initialization
   scripts: initscripts or sysconfig.  Recent versions of these packages
   have support for bonding, while older versions do not. /etc/net has
   built-in support for interface bonding.

   The detail implementation of the Linux Bonding Driver can be found in
   [Linux-Bonding-Driver]

A.2.  Net:Bridge

   The Linux bridging implementation provides a bridge that can connect
   two or more physical NICs together to form one logical interface.
   Packets are forwarded based on NIC's address, rather than IP address.
   Since forwarding is done at Layer 2, all protocols can go
   transparently through a bridge.

   The Linux bridging code has been integrated into 2.4 and 2.6 kernel
   series.  The detail implementation of the Linux Bonding Driver can be
   found in [Net:Bridge]

A.3.  Intel Advanced Networking Services With Ethernet Teaming

   Intel provides a graphical user interface tool, called PROSet, for
   managing Intel's network products and Advanced Networking Services
   (ANS).  PROSet is designed to run in on Linux, Microsoft(R)
   Windows(R) 2000, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008 and Windows
   7.  PROSet is used to perform diagnostics, configure load balancing
   and fault tolerance teaming, and VLANs.  In addition, it displays the
   MAC address, driver version, and status information.  On Linux the

   PROSet executable is known as xprocfg.  Xprocfg can be used in custom
   initialization scripts.
