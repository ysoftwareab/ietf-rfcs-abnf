 CAPWAP Control and Data Channel Separation for Multi-provider Scenario
              draft-you-opsawg-capwap-separation-for-mp-00

Abstract

   The CAPWAP control channel and data channel split architecture has
   some benefits, such as relieving the capacity pressure of the AC,
   which has been discussed in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel] and
   [I-D.xue-opsawg-capwap-separation-capability].  However, only single-
   provider scenario is considered so far.  This document discusses the
   third-party WLAN service provider scenario (i.e.  multi-provider),
   and proposes to extend CAPWAP for supporting this use case.

1.  Introduction

   The CAPWAP control channel and data channel split architecture has
   some benefits, such as relieving the capacity pressure of the AC,
   which has been discussed in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel] and
   [I-D.xue-opsawg-capwap-separation-capability].

   In this document, we introduce a third-party WLAN service provider
   scenario, as shown in Figure 1, also verifies the benefits of having
   this split architecture.  In this scenario, the WLAN provider owns
   the WTP and AC resources.  Other service providers can rent the WTP
   resources from the WLAN provider for network access.  The AC
   belonging to the WLAN service provider controls the WTP in a
   centralized location.

   Given that three other service providers (provider 1, 2 and 3) don't
   have their own network access resources, they rent the WTP resources
   from the WLAN provider.  Provider 1/2/3 provide the services to their
   users by renting the network access resources.  The users of the

   provider 1/2/3 are authenticated by provider 1/2/3 themselves.  As
   the WLAN service provider isn't aware of the users' data traffic of
   provider 1/2/3, the data traffic from the users can be directly
   routed to the corresponding Access Router (AR) of the provider who
   owns the users.  The data traffic directly to the AR can
   significantly avoid overload on the AC.

        Figure 1: Third-party WLAN Service Provider

   This document discusses the third-party WLAN service provider
   scenario, and proposes to extend CAPWAP for supporting this case.
   [I-D.xue-opsawg-capwap-separation-capability] describes CAPWAP
   Control Channel and CAPWAP Data Channel separation (i.e.  CAPWAP
   Split Mode), but it only considers single-provider scenario.  The
   following section will discuss the extension in order to support
   multi-provider scenario.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions for terms used frequently
   throughout this document.  However, many additional definitions can
   be found in [RFC5415] and [RFC5416].

      Station (STA): A device that contains an IEEE 802.11 conformant
      medium access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to
      the wireless medium (WM).

Internet-Draft          capwap separation for mp           February 2015


      Wireless Termination Point (WTP): The physical or network entity
      that contains an RF antenna and wireless Physical Layer (PHY) to
      transmit and receive station traffic for wireless access networks.

      Access Controller (AC): The network entity that provides WTP
      access to the network infrastructure in the data plane, control
      plane, management plane, or a combination therein.

      Access Router (AR): The access server of the provider.

      CAPWAP Control Channel: A bi-directional flow defined by the AC IP
      Address, WTP IP Address, AC control port, WTP control port, and
      the transport-layer protocol (UDP or UDP-Lite) over which CAPWAP
      Control packets are sent and received.

      CAPWAP Data Channel: A bi-directional flow defined by the AC IP
      Address, WTP IP Address, AC data port, WTP data port, and the
      transport-layer protocol (UDP or UDP-Lite) over which CAPWAP Data
      packets are sent and received.

3.  Split CAPWAP-CTL and CAPWAP-DATA for Multi-provider

   A WTP is capable of supporting up to 16 Service Set Identifiers
   (SSIDs).  The WLAN provider may provide network access service for
   different provider with different SSID.  For example, for provider 1,
   its corresponding SSID is SSID1.  Give that a user attaches to the
   network by SSID1, the WTP needs to send the user's data traffic to
   AR1 of provider 1 via CAPWAP data channel.  So WTP needs to obtain
   the AR addresses of different providers first.  The AC of the WLAN
   service provider needs to maintain the association of the AR
   addresses of the tenant providers and SSIDs, and provide this
   information to the WTP.  A CAPWAP AR-and-SSID association element is
   proposed to describe this information, that will be discussed in the
   following section.

4.  CAPWAP AR-and-SSID Association Element

   A new CAPWAP message element (as shown in Figure 2) is defined in
   this section for CAPWAP control channel and data channel split
   architecture in order to support multi-provider scenario.  The AC
   maintains an AR-and-SSID association table, and provides the AR-and-
   SSID association element the WTP.

    Figure 2: AR-and-SSID Association Element

      Type: The Type field is two octets, and identifies the type of
      CAPWAP packet element.  The value of the Type is TBD.

      Length: The Length field is two octets.  It indicates the length
      of the packet including the Type, Length, SSID and AR address
      fields.  The minimum length is 16.

      SSID: The SSID attribute is the service set identifier that will
      be advertised by the WTP for this WLAN.  The SSID field contains
      any ASCII character and MUST NOT exceed 32 octets in length, as
      defined in [IEEE.802-11.2007].

      AR Address: the IP address of AR served for WTP in the network.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one CAPWAP element.  IANA is requested to
   allocate the type value of AR-and-SSID association element.

6.  Security considerations

   This document does not constrain the use of encryption mechanisms to
   protect the data channel.  If there is security requirement for
   CAPWAP Data Channel, Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC4347] and the IPSec mechanism [RFC2401] can be used to guarantee
   the security of the CAPWAP Data Channel.
