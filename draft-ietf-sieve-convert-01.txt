Internet-Draft                Sieve CONVERT                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IMAP CONVERT extension [RFC5259] adds an IMAP command for
   performing client-controlled conversions on whole messages or their
   body parts.  This document defines a similar extension to the Sieve
   mail filtering language [RFC5228], which reuses the conversion
   parameters and framework established by IMAP CONVERT.

1.1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Conventions for notations are as in Sieve [RFC5228] section 1.1,
   including the use of ABNF [RFC5234].


2.  "convert" action

   Usage: convert  <quoted-from-mime-type: string>
           <quoted-to-mime-type: string>
           <transcoding-params: string-list>

   The "convert" action specifies that body parts with "quoted-from-
   mime-type" MIME type be converted to "quoted-to-mime-type" MIME type
   using conversion parameters specified in "transcoding-params".  Each
   conversion parameter value has the following syntax: "<transcoding-
   param>=<transcoding-param-value>", where <transcoding-param> and
   <transcoding-param-value> are defined in CONVERT [RFC5259].  Messages
   that don't have any body parts with the "quoted-from-mime-type" MIME
   type are not affected by the conversion.

   The "convert" action can be used with Sieve MIME Part Tests
   [RFC5703], in the case that some, but not all of the body parts need
   to be converted, or where different body parts might require
   different conversions.  When the "convert" action appears in a
   "foreverypart" loop, it applies only to the body part being
   processed, and not to any other body parts (see Section 3.2 for an
   example).

   When the "convert" action appears outside a "foreverypart" loop, the
   conversion applies equally to all body parts -- that is, all body
   parts that have the "quoted-from-mime-type" are converted, using the
   same transcoding parameters.

   Implementations ought to defer any actual conversion until the final
   resolution of other actions, to avoid doing conversions unnecessarily

   in cases where the message is not retained (such as where the
   resolution is "discard").

2.1.  Interaction with other actions

   Whether the actual conversion has been done yet or not, a "convert"
   action effectively changes the message, and all subsequent actions,
   including any other "convert" actions, apply to the changed message.
   The "convert" action does not affect the applicability of other
   actions; any action that was applicable before the "convert" is
   equally applicable to the changed message afterward.

   All conversions are performed before any disposition-type actions.
   Therefore, the sequence "convert, fileinto, convert" is the same as
   "convert, convert, fileinto": in both cases, all conversions are done
   before the message is filed.

   Repeating for emphasis: note that disposition-type actions, such as
   "fileinto" and "redirect", will work on the converted message, filing
   or redirecting it after all conversions are done.

   See Section 3.4 for an example of how this might be tricky.


3.  Examples

3.1.  Example 1

   In the following example, all "image/tiff" body parts of the message
   are converted to "image/jpeg" with image resolution of 320x240
   pixels.  The message is then subject to the implicit keep.

       require ["convert"];
       convert "image/tiff" "image/jpeg" "pix-x" "320" "pix-y" "240";

3.2.  Example 2

   In the following example, all "image/tiff" body parts of the message
   are converted to "image/jpeg", as in Example 1.  Those messages are
   then filed into a mailbox called "INBOX.pics".  Other messages (those
   with no image/tiff body parts) are subject to the implicit keep.

       require ["mime", "fileinto", "convert"];
       if header :mime :anychild :contenttype
                 "Content-Type" "image/tiff"
       {
         convert "image/tiff" "image/jpeg" "pix-x" "320" "pix-y" "240";
         fileinto "INBOX.pics";

       }

3.3.  Example 3

   In the following example, only "image/tiff" body parts with a
   Content-Disposition of "inline" are converted.  Matching parts that
   are larger than 500 kilobytes are converted using an image resolution
   of 640x480 pixels, and those smaller are converted to 320x240 pixels.
   The message disposition is not changed, so the implicit keep will be
   in effect unless something else in the script changes that.

       require ["mime", "foreverypart", "fileinto", "convert"];
       foreverypart
       {
         if header :mime :param "filename" :contains
                   "Content-Disposition" "inline"
         {
           if size :over "500K"
           {
             convert "image/tiff" "image/jpeg"
                     "pix-x" "640" "pix-y" "480";
           } else {
             convert "image/tiff" "image/jpeg"
                     "pix-x" "320" "pix-y" "240";
           }
         }
       }

       [... script continues ...]

3.4.  Example 4

   The following example shows some tricky interactions between multiple
   "convert" actions and other disposition-type actions.

       # The first "if" block will convert all image/tiff body parts
       # to 640x480 jpegs, and will register the message to be filed
       # into the "INBOX.pics" mailbox.  But the rest of the script
       # will be  run before the "fileinto" is done.

       # parts that had been converted in the first block, above.
       # Therefore, any tiff that had been converted to a 640x480 jpeg
       # will be re-converted to a 320x240 jpeg here if its
       # Content-Disposition is specified as "inline".

                   "pix-x" "320" "pix-y" "240";
         }
       }

       # The third block will redirect the message to Joe if it
       # contains any tiff body parts.  But because of the earlier
       # conversion (in the first block), there will never be any
       # tiff body parts, so the message will never be redirected.
       if header :mime :anychild :contenttype
                 "Content-Type" "image/tiff"
       {
         redirect "joe@example.com";
       }

       # Now, at the end of the script processing, after all
       # conversions, the message will be filed into "INBOX.pics"
       # if the first "if" block was taken, or will be implicitly
       # kept if not.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations given in IMAP CONVERT [RFC5259] and Sieve
   [RFC5228] are relevant to this document.  There are no additional
   security considerations resulting from combining the two.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following registration to the Sieve
   Extensions registry, as defined in RFC 5228:

   Capability name:  convert
   Description:  adds a new tag to the fileinto action that enables
      Sieve script to perform a conversion on the message being
      delivered.
   RFC number:  this RFC
   Contact address:  The Sieve discussion list <sieve@ietf.org>


6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors also want to thank all who have contributed key insight
   and extensively reviewed and discussed the concepts of CONVERT.
