1. Certificate Status

   A certificate is issued with a predetermined validity interval. It is
   common practice to specify a validity interval that starts a few 
   hours or days before the instant of issue so as to avoid rejection by
   machines with clocks running behind the current time or otherwise 
   mis-set. In normal operation the certificate will remain valid until 
   it expires. 

   The CA that issued a certificate has primary responsibility for 
   maintaining the certificate life cycle and reporting changes to 
   certificate status. But other parties can and in some cases do report
   status for third party certificates. In particular client and 
   platform providers have revoked certificates known to have been mis-
   issued or in a case of a CA breach. 

   [Introduce CRL Sets here, once I find a citation] 

1.1. Operational Certificate Lifecycle Model

   PKIX does not describe a certificate lifecyle model. Instead the 
   certificate lifecycle model is a consequence of the issue of PKIX 
   Certificates and CRLs. While this is sufficient for describing PKIX 
   it is not satisfactory as a reference model for describing 
   operations. Not least because modern PKIX operations are frequently 
   based on the use of OCSP rather than CRLs and differences in the 
   semantics of CRLs and OCSP are one of the features we would want to 
   measure. The distinction between an operational model and PKIX 
   semantics is illustrated by considering the difference between the 
   operational concept of direct/indirect status assertions and the PKIX
   semantics of direct/indirect CRLs. 

1.1.1. Direct and Indirect Status Assertions

   PKIX CRLs may be marked as direct or indirect to indicate that they 
   are issued by the same CA that issued the original certificate (a 
   direct CRL) or by a third party (an indirect CRL). 

   In the corresponding operational model we define a direct status 
   assertion as being by the same CA that issued the original 
   certificate and an indirect status assertion as being any status 
   assertion that is not direct. 

   The difference between the operational and PKIX models has important 
   practical consequences. The CA that originally issued an assertion 
   naturally holds a privileged position when it comes to revoking it. A
   direct CRL thus has a privileged position when considering the 
   question of certificate validity. A direct status assertion thus has 
   a privileged position when considering revocation status. A direct 
   CRL carries an implicit claim that it is a direct status assertion 
   but this is merely a claim unless the client validating the CRL takes



                           November 14, 2014                    [Page 4]

Internet-Draft Web PKI Operations: Revocation and Status        May 2014

   steps to verify it. For example by verifying that the CRL signature 
   has valid trust chain to the same trust anchor as the certificate. 

   CRLs introduce a further complication as a CRL contains a list of 
   explicit statements declaring that a certificate is invalid. In the 
   case of a direct CRL there is an implicit assertion that any issued, 
   unexpired certificate not listed was valid at the time the CRL was 
   issued. The processing rules specified in [RFC5280] appear to limit 
   this implicit assertion to direct CRLs but this does not appear to be
   called out in the text. 

   One of the main use cases that might motivate the issue of an 
   indirect status assertion is the case where a third party notices 
   that a certificate is being used for malicious purposes and intends 
   to advise relying parties that they should not trust the certificate 
   subject. Since it is the behavior of the subject rather than their 
   identity that is at issue, there may not be sufficient reason for the
   CA to revoke the certificate. There is thus a case for parties other 
   than the certificate subject and issuer having the ability to revoke 
   certificates in certain circumstances. But does granting this ability
   also confer the ability to (implicitly) declare certificates valid? 

   [Operational question: Do clients interpret indirect CRLs as 
   substitutes for the direct CRL or as adjuncts providing additional 
   information.] 

1.1.2. Trust Path Processing

   One of the operational questions we would like to understand is the 
   extent to which it is possible to revoke EE certificates by revoking 
   one or more of the Certificate Signing Certificates in the 
   certification path. 

   Self Signed certificates used to transport Trust Anchors are not 
   actually PKIX certificates and are not governed by the PKIX model 
   (although they are X.509v3 certificates). One important consequence 
   of this is that relying parties do not use PKIX mechanisms to check 
   the validity of Trust Anchors. 

   CSCs signed by the trust anchor are potentially subject to 
   revocation. Do the status checking mechanisms employed in browsers 
   support this in practice? 

   [OCSP and CRLs raise separate issues here. In the case of an OCSP 
   responder should we require signed OCSP tokens for each cert in the 
   path? Is it possible to use a mix of CSCs and OCSP in stapled 
   tokens?]

1.1.3. Revocation Reasons

   A status declarer may declare a certificate invalid (i.e. revoke the 
   certificate) before its scheduled expiry for a variety of reason that
   include: 

      Subject requested revocation
         The certificate subject requested revocation. 

      Subject requested correction 
         The certificate subject requested information in a certificate 
         be corrected either because the original information is wrong 
         or circumstances have changed. For example the subject's 
         affiliation has changed. Such corrections are typically made by
         revoking the original certificate and issuing a replacement. 

      Payment declined 
         A CA may issue a certificate before payment has cleared. If the
         payment is subsequently declined, the certificate is revoked. 

      Declined extension 
         The certificate was originally issued on condition that use 
         beyond an initial period would require an additional fee which 
         the subject did not pay. 

      Terms of Use 
         The subject was determined to have breached the terms of use 

      Fraudulent Request 
         The application was determined to be fraudulent after issue 

      CA compromise 
         The certificate can no longer be trusted because the operations
         of the CA were compromised. 

   The ability to provide a reason for revocation is defined, without 
   explaining why a CA should provide this information or how relying 
   parties should behave differently according to the revocation reason 
   given. Revoked certificates are to be considered invalid regardless 
   of the reason for revocation. 

   PKIX does not define an order of severity. In cases where multiple 
   reasons apply, the CA may pick any. There is no obligation to report 
   a reason at all let alone report severity. 

   Once a certificate is revoked the certificate lifecycle is complete 
   as far as the CA is concerned and there is no obligation on the CA to
   update the revocation reason after the fact to reflect the discovery 
   of a more serious cause. 





                           November 14, 2014                    [Page 6]

Internet-Draft Web PKI Operations: Revocation and Status        May 2014

   In the case of a subject request the CA only has reliable knowledge 
   of the fact of the request and not the reason(s) the request was 
   made. A certificate subject might have requested the certificate be 
   revoked because they have no further use for it or because they know 
   the associated private key has been compromised. Even if the CA asks 
   for the revocation reason there is no reason to expect the subject to
   answer. The subject may not wish to report that a private key has 
   been compromised. 

   The net effect of these limitations is that revocation reasons only 
   provide a lower bound on the severity of the cause for which a 
   certificate was revoked. 

1.1.4. Operational Certificate States

   From an operational point of view, once issued, a PKIX certificate 
   has five potential states, a single valid state and four invalid 
   states: 

      Nonexistent
         The certificate does not exist. This may be because the 
         certificate has not yet been issued or it will never be issued.

      Valid
         The certificate was issued and is valid. 

      Invalid
         No certificate was issued or the certificate issued is no 
         longer valid. Hold The certificate exists but has been 
         suspended with the possibility of reinstatement. Revoked The 
         certificate exists but has been declared to be invalid with 
         permanent effect. Expired The certificate existed in the past 
         but the expiry date specified at issue has passed. 

   The Hold state has been found to be of little or no practical value 
   since issuing a new certificate is simpler and more effective than 
   attempting to cancel a previous instruction to put the certificate on
   hold. 

   CRLs and certain OCSP configurations do not permit a client to 
   distinguish between the states Valid and Invalid/Nonexistent. The CRL
   mechanism was designed to allow a relying party to check the validity
   of a known certificate. It was thus unnecessary to distinguish the 
   states Valid and Nonexistent as that would be verified by checking 
   the signature. Accordingly a CRL contains only a list of invalid 
   certificates. 

   In the case of a CA Breach, key compromise or cryptanalytic attack, a
   certificate may be created that has a valid signature but was not 
   issued by the CA. Such a certificate is 'Nonexistent' as far as the 
   CA is concerned. Requiring a CA to distinguish these states in 



                           November 14, 2014                    [Page 7]

Internet-Draft Web PKI Operations: Revocation and Status        May 2014

   reporting certificate status provides a limited degree of 
   transparency in CA operations. A CA that reports 'Nonexistent' in 
   response to a status request for an unexpired certificate that has a 
   valid signature has a defective or breached issue process. A CA that 
   reports valid in response to a status request for a non-existent 
   certificate has a defective or breached revocation mechanism. 

1.2. Client Behavior

   WebPKI clients are advised but not required to check certificate 
   status before relying on the assertions they contain. Waiting to 
   obtain status information from an external source before relying on a
   certificate may cause delay or even rejection of a valid certificate.

   Excluding the possibility that a client requests revocation status 
   then ignores the result, the options available to a Web PKI client 
   are therefore: 

      Ignore 
         The client does not process revocation status from any source 

      Local 
         The client only process revocation status that is available 
         from local sources. For example hardcoded 'do not trust' lists 
         or CRLSets. 

      Soft-Fail 
         The client attempts to obtain revocation status from external 
         sources and will reject certificates reported as revoked but 
         will accept a certificate as valid if the external source 
         cannot be contacted, does not reply or rejects the request, 
         etc. 

      Hard-Fail 
         The client attempts to obtain revocation status from external 
         sources and will reject certificates unless either an 
         affirmative assertion of validity or an affirmative assertion 
         of not revoked is obtained. 

2. Status Assertion Mechanisms

2.1. CRLs

   The PKIX CRL mechanism for asserting certificate status is described 
   in [RFC5280] 

2.1.1. Status Model"

   A CRL only provides a list of certificates that have been revoked. An
   issued, unexpired certificate is presumed to be valid if it does not 
   appear in the CRL. The certificate states supported by the CRL 



                           November 14, 2014                    [Page 8]

Internet-Draft Web PKI Operations: Revocation and Status        May 2014

   mechanism are thus: 

      UNREVOKED 
         Corresponds to operational states Valid, Nonexistent and 
         Expired. 

      UNDETERMINED 
         Occurs when no CRL with a corresponding scope is available. 

      REVOKED
         Corresponds to operational state Revoked. 

      HOLD 
         Corresponds to operational state Hold. 

   The CRL result 'UNREVOKED' thus corresponds to three states in the 
   Operational model of which one is Valid and the other two are Invalid
   states. A client that does not have a source of trusted time 
   available may use the issue time of the CRL as the basis for checking
   expiry. The CRL mechanism does not provide a means of determining 
   that a certificate was legitimately issued 

2.1.2. Revocation Reasons

   [RFC5280] requires that a CRL entry specify a reason code but not the
   circumstances in which a code should be raised. [[This is however 
   specified in X.509v3] The following reason codes are defined: 

      *  unspecified

      *  keyCompromise

      *  cACompromise

      *  affiliationChanged

      *  superseded

      *  cessationOfOperation

      *  privilegeWithdrawn

      *  aACompromise

2.2. OCSP

   OCSP is defined in [RFC6960]. [RFC5019] (lightweight) and TLS 
   Stapling [RFC6066] Section 8. 






                           November 14, 2014                    [Page 9]

Internet-Draft Web PKI Operations: Revocation and Status        May 2014

   An OCSP service MAY return the following responses to a request: 

      Success [[+ CRL Status Code] 
         The OCSP status request succeeded and the service returned one 
         of the CRL status codes described above. 

      Refused 
         The OCSP responder refused to answer the request. 

      Unknown 
         The certificate for which status was requested was not found or
         the status is not determined. 

      Invalid
         The OCSP server returned an answer that was not understood. 

      Fail 
         The service failed to answer the request or the client was 
         unable to contact the OCSP service. 

   The OCSP response reflects the success or failure of the OCSP 
   transaction rather than the status of the certificate being queried. 
   Thus a client whose behavior is Soft-Fail will only reject a 
   certificate if the OCSP response Success and an Invalid certificate 
   status is returned. Thus an OCSP server that responds to a request 
   for status for a certificate that is known to have never been issued 
   with 'Invalid' will cause soft-fail clients to accept the 
   certificate. 

   Note that [RFC6960] does not differentiate the results Success/Valid 
   and Unknown. CAs are however required to differentiate these 
   responses under the CABForum Basic Requirements [TBS]. 

   The OCSP protocol permits responses to be signed in advance [static] 
   or provide a proof of freshness by returning a nonce presented by the
   client. 

   The protocol only permits static responses to report the status of 
   individual certificates. There is no feature analagous to the NSEC3 
   feature of DNSSEC which permits the non-existence of an entry in a 
   particular range to be asserted. 

2.2.1. CRL Responder

   An OCSP responder may generate responses from CRLs. Such a responder 
   can generate most but not all the responses required in advance by 
   generating revoked responses for all the certificates listed in the 
   CRL and valid responses for all the certificate serial numbers 
   presented in previous requests. 





                           November 14, 2014                   [Page 10]

Internet-Draft Web PKI Operations: Revocation and Status        May 2014

   Such a responder cannot distinguish between Valid and nonexistent 
   states unless provided with additional information not in the CRL. 

2.2.2. Lightweight Distribution

   In the lightweight distribution mode of operation specified in 
   [RFC5019], the CA generates OCSP responses for all unexpired 
   certificates that it has issued. The signed tokens are then passed to
   a separate network for distribution. For example, a Content Delivery 
   Network with a large number of delivery points. 

   One of the main strengths of this model is that all the signing of 
   OCSP tokens is done offline and no signing key is ever exposed to an 
   external network. One consequence of this model is that responses for
   nonexistent certificates cannot be signed. 

2.2.3. OCSP Stapling

   One of the principle limitations of the traditional OCSP model is 
   that each TLS transaction becomes a three party communication. To 
   complete the TLS connection the client must communicate with the 
   server being contacted and the OCSP service. This approach introduces
   unnecessary delay and an additional potential point of failure and is
   therefore unsatisfactory. 

   OCSP stapling permits a TLS server to provide a client that supports 
   the stapling extension to provide the OCSP token together with the 
   certificate it corresponds to. This permits a client to establish a 
   TLS communication without the need for a three party communication in
   the case that the client and server both support stapling. 

   The chief drawback to stapling is that support for stapling is 
   optional. thus a client that does not receive a stapled token must 
   attempt to obtain it from the OCSP service and is therefore subject 
   to the same Softfail/hardfail dilemma described above. 

2.3. Other

2.3.1. Hardcoded/Indirect Revocation List

   Most browsers employ a 'blacklist' to block certificates known to be 
   mis-issued. The number of entries supported in such lists is 
   typically small. In some cases the list is hardcoded in the browser 
   or platform code and is only updated with the browser or platform. In
   other cases the blacklist is updatable separately. 

   Q: Which Web browsers support update of the list without updating the
   browser.

2.3.2. DANE

   DANE assertions [RFC6698] may be used to cancel a certificate. 
   [describe] 

2.3.3. Certificate Transparency

   CT [RFC6962] provides a means of auditing the operation of a CA using
   only information that is available to the public from log servers. 
   Moreover a client can determine that a certificate has been issued 
   transparently (i.e. is in the log) or not. Any certificate the client
   receives that is not in the log should be treated as suspicious or 
   invalid by the client. 

   In order for CT to work, a CA registers a certificate in a log server
   and is returned a signed time stamp by the log server. This signed 
   time stamp must be given to the certificate subject, and it must send
   this to RPs along with its certificate. This requires the TLS 
   handshake to be enhanced to pass the signed time stamp, and clients 
   and servers to be enhanced to receive and send it. This will take 
   time to be rolled out to the entire Internet, so CT is not a short 
   term solution. 

   Monitor servers regularly scan the logs to look for suspicious or 
   unauthorised certificates that have been deposited there. 

   One potential problem with CT is that it is not described how the 
   monitors will operate and determine whether a certificate is 
   suspicious or unauthorised. How will they know if a certificate is 
   suspicious or not? How will clients be notified of this? What does 
   suspicious actually mean to a client? How should a client behave when
   it is told that a certificate is dodgy by a monitor? Who arbitrates 
   on this if there is a disagreement between monitors or monitors and a
   CA? Is it the issuing CA? If so, this will not stop a compelled 
   certificate creation attack since it is the subject that has to say 
   which certificate is false and which is not, since both were issued 
   by the same CA or its subordinate.

4. Cryptography Platforms (to be completed once the survey is finished)

   [Should expand this noting that while support for a feature in the 
   platfor is often a necessary for support in applications, it is not 
   necessarily sufficient.]

5. Web Server Status (TBC once the survey is finished)

   Web Server support for revocation is fairly straightforward since the
   Web Server is only involved in revocation in the case of stapled OCSP
   tokens and this is supported in the latest versions of all the 
   servers surveyed.

6. Web Client Status (TBC once the survey is finished)

   [Need to consider further dimensions here. In particular Chrome 
   behaves differently depending on the platform it is on and several 
   browsers have different revocation checking for EV vs other 
   certificate policies.]

6.1. Checklist

      Supported Revocation Checking Mechanisms
         To Do: Some browsers do not support CRL DP. Others give 
         preference to OCSP, but fall back to CRL DP if the necessary 
         AIA is missing. Some browsers give priority to OCSP, but switch
         to CRL DP when a particular issuer's revocation information is 
         retrieved frequently.

         for this site has been revoked. This site should not be 
         trusted" 

         If however, a valid trust path cannot be found, the user 
         receives the error message for the invalid trust path instead: 
         "The user is presented with a dialogue box that tells them that
         'Information you exchange with this site cannot be viewed or 
         changed by others. However there is a problem with the site's

   For Apple?s OS X, OCSP and CRL checking can be configured via 
   Keychain Access -> Preferences ?> Certificates. A dialog box opens 
   with three rows: OCSP, CRL, and Priority. Under OCSP and CRL, the 
   three allowed options (a grayed-out one said something like ?always?)
   were: ?Off?, ?Best Attempt?, and ?Required if certificate indicates?.
   ?Best Attempt? was the default. Under Priority, the options were 
   ?OCSP? ?CRL? and ?Require both?. ?OCSP? was the default.

   IE5: Popup dialog box: "Revocation information for the security 
   certificate for this site is not available. Do you want to proceed?" 

7. CA Status

   Historical behavior is only of interest to the extent that it affects
   current operations. 

   Every PKIX certificate has a built in expiry date. Thus we are only 
   interested in CA operations from the date at which their oldest 
   unexpired certificate is still valid. 

7.1. Checklist
