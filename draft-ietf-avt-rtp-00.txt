                                  Abstract


     This  draft describes a protocol (RTP)  suitable for the transport
    of  real-time  data,  such  as audio,   video or  simulation  data.
    The  data transport  is  enhanced by  a  control protocol  designed
    to provide  minimal control  and identification  functionality.   A
    reverse control protocol provides mechanisms for monitoring quality
    of service and  other content-specific requests.   This protocol is
    intended for experimental use.


1 Introduction


This draft concisely specifies a real-time transport protocol.  A discussion
of the design decisions can be found in the current version of the companion
Internet draft draft-ietf-avt-issues.txt.   The transport protocol  provides


INTERNET-DRAFT                     RTP                     December 15, 1992

end-to-end delivery services for  one or more flows  of data with  real-time
characteristics, for example,  interactive audio  and video.    It does  not
guarantee delivery or prevent out-of-order delivery, nor does it assume that
the underlying network is  reliable and delivers packets  in sequence.   RTP
is designed to run on top of  a variety of network and transport  protocols,
for example, IP,  ST-II or UDP.  RTP transfers data  in a single  direction,
possibly to multiple destinations if supported by the underlying network.  A
mechanism for indicating a return path for control data is provided.

While RTP is  primarily designed  to satisfy the  needs of  multiparticipant
multimedia conferences, it  is not limited  to that particular  application.
Storage of continuous data,  interactive distributed simulation and  control
and measurement applications  may also find  RTP applicable.   Profiles  are
used to instantiate certain header fields and options for particular sets of
applications.

This document defines two packet formats and protocols:


  o the  real-time  transport  protocol  (RTP)  for  exchanging  data   with
    real-time properties.

  o the real-time  control protocol (RTCP)  for conveying information  about
    the sites in an on-going  association.  RTCP information may be  ignored
    without affecting the ability to correctly receive information.


Control fields  (options) for  RTP and  RTCP share  the same  structure  and
numbering space and are carried  within the same packet.   Within a  packet,
RTP options precede RTCP options.   Each option  consists of the final  bit,
the option type  designation, a  one-octet length field  denoting the  total
number of 32-bit long words comprising the option (including final bit, type
and length), and finally any option-specific  data.  The last option  before
the packet data portion has  the 'F' (final) bit set  to one, for all  other
options this field has a value of zero.

Field within the fixed header and within options are aligned to the  natural
length of  the field,  i.e., 16-bit  words are  aligned  on even  addresses,
32-bit long words are aligned at addresses  divisible by four, etc.   Octets
designated as padding  have the  value zero.    Options unknown  to the  RTP
implementation or the application  are to be ignored.   Options with  option
types having values  from 64 to  127 inclusive are  passed unaltered to  the
appropriate application.   Fields designated  as MBZ ('must  be zero')  must
have a value of binary zero and are to be ignored by the receiver.

All integer  fields  are  carried in  network  byte  order,  that  is,  most
significant byte (octet)  first.   The  transmission order  is described  in
detail in [1], Appendix A. Unless otherwise noted, constants are in  decimal
(base 10).

2 Real-time Data Transfer Protocol -- RTP



2.1 Framing


If and only if  RTP protocol data units  (RPDU) are carried over  underlying
protocols that provide  the abstraction  of a continuous  bit stream  rather
than messages,  each RPDU  (and any  synchronization source  identifier,  as
defined below) is prefixed by a  32-bit framing field containing the  length
of the  RPDU  measured  in  octets,  including  the  synchronization  source
identifier, but not including the framing field itself.  If a RPDU traverses
a mixture  of  octet-stream  and  message-oriented  networks,  each  gateway
between these networks is  responsible for adding  and removing the  framing
field.


2.2 Synchronization Source Encapsulation


A content source is  defined to be  the actual source  of the data  carried,
for example, the application and workstation where the audio was  digitized.
The synchronization  source  is  the  combination of  one  or  more  content
sources with its own timing.   A network source is the network-level  origin
of the  RPDUs as  seen  by the  end system.    Unless  otherwise  specified,
the content  source  and  synchronization  source are  both  assumed  to  be
identical to the  network source.    If the  synchronization source  differs
from the network  source,  the RPDU  is prefixed  with a  32-bit IP  address
designating the network source.  This encapsulation may be used by  gateways
and transport-level firewalls.    The end system  has to  determine by  some
means outside  this specification  whether  it is  being  served by  such  a
facility.  [NOTE:  The method of determining  whether encapsulation is  used
or not is unsatisfactory, particularly for sites where only some  conference
participants are connected  through reflectors.   The method  was chosen  to
allow reflectors to be independent of the protocol particulars.]

A synchronization unit consists  of one or  more packets that,  as a  group,
share a common fixed  delay between generation and  playout of each part  of
the group, or can only be scheduled as a whole.  The delay may change at the
beginning of such a synchronization unit.   The most common  synchronization
units are talkspurts for voice and frames for video transmission.


2.3 RTP Header Fields


The header fields have the following meaning:

INTERNET-DRAFT                     RTP                     December 15, 1992

protocol version: 2 bits
    Defines  the protocol  version.    The version  number of  the  protocol
    defined in this draft is one.

flow: 6 bits
    The value of the field is the flow identifier, one of the items  used by
    the receiver for demultiplexing.

option present bit (O): 1 bit
    This flag has a value of one if the fixed RTP header is followed  by one
    or more options.

end-of-synchronization-unit (S): 1 bit
    This flag has  a value of  one in the last  packet of a  synchronization
    unit, a value of zero otherwise.

content: 6 bits
    The  content  field forms  an  index  into a  table  defined  through  a
    conference announcement  protocol (to  be specified),  RTCP messages,  a
    conference server or  some other out-of-band means.   If no mapping  has
    been defined in this manner,  a standard mapping to be specified by  RFC
    1340, Assigned Numbers, or its successor, is to be used.

sequence number: 16 bits
    The sequence number counts RPDUs.

timestamp: 32 bits
    The timestamp reflects the  wallclock time when the RPDU was  generated.
    The timestamp consists of the middle 32 bits of a 64-bit  NTP timestamp,
    as defined in RFC 1305.  Note that several consecutive packets  may have
    equal timestamps.  The maximum difference between the timestamp  and the
    true time is encoded in the RTCP CDESC option.

    The  timestamp of  the first  packet(s)  within a  synchronization  unit
    is expected  to closely  reflect the actual  sampling instant,  measured
    by the  local system  clock.    It is  not expected  that the  timestamp
    of the  beginning of  every synchronization  unit  is based  on a  local
    synchronized system  clock.   However,  the local clock  should be  used
    frequently enough so that clock drift between synchronized  system clock
    and sampling clock can be compenssated for gradually.  The  local system
    clock should be  controlled by a  time synchronization protocol such  as
    NTP. For packets  inside a synchronization unit,  it may be  appropriate
    to compute timestamps  based on the logical  timing relationships.   For
    audio samples, for example,  the nominal sampling interval may be  used.
    If  the clock  quality  field of  the  CDESC option  does  not  indicate
    otherwise,  it is  assumed that  the  timestamp at  the beginning  of  a
    synchronization unit is derived from a synchronized system clock.


The packet  header is  followed by  options,  if any,  and the  media  data.
Optional fields are summarized below.   Unless otherwise noted, each  option

        the content source.   The length of  the content source address  and
        thus of the CSRC option may change in the future; a receiver  should
        be prepared to accept identifiers of up to ten octets.  If  missing,
        the network source is considered the content source.

3 Real Time Control Packets --- RTCP


The real-time control protocol  (RTCP) conveys minimal out-of-band  advisory
information during a  conference.   The services provided  by RTCP  services
enhance RTP, but  an end-node does  not have to  implement RTCP features  to
participate in conferences(1).  RTCP does not aim to provide the services of
a conference control protocol  and does not  provide services desirable  for
two-party conversations.

Unless otherwise  noted,  control  information is  carried  periodically  as
options within RPDUs.  In the absence of media data, packets containing only
RTCP data are sent periodically to the same multicast group as data packets,
using the same  time-to-live value.   The period  should be varied  randomly
to avoid  synchronization of  all sources  and should  be roughly  inversely
proportional to the number of participants in the conference.  The length of
the period determines, for example, how long a receiver joining a conference
has to wait in the worst case until it can identify the source.   An initial
period varying randomly between 3 and 10 seconds is recommended.

The item types are defined below:


3.1 Forward Control Options


The following options are sent in the same direction as the data stream.


CDESC 32   Content description.

------------------------------
 1. There is  one exception to  that rule:   if an  application sends  CDESC
options, the receiver has to decode these in order to properly interpret the
RTP payload

INTERNET-DRAFT                     RTP                     December 15, 1992

        content:  6 bits
            The  'content'  field  designates  the  index  value  from   the
            'content' fixed header field, with values ranging from 0 to 63.

        Return port number:  16 bits
            The return  port number is  defined as  the port to  be used  as
            a destination port  number for transmitting control  information
            from the receiver of  RTP data to its sender.   A value of  zero
            indicates that no control information should be returned.

        Clock quality:  8 bits
            Provides an  indication as  to the  sender-perceived quality  of
            the timestamps  in the  RTP header.   The  octet is  interpreted
            as a quantity indicating  the maximum dispersion to a root  time
            server measured  in fractions  of a  second and  expressed as  a
            power of two.

            If a source is known to be slaved to NTP, but does not  know its
            dispersion, or  the dispersion  is greater than  TBD, the  value
            TBD is used.   If the clock is based on the nominal sample  rate
            of the source,  a value of TBD is used.   [These values need  to
            be finalized.]

            The clock quality indication can be used to judge how  the delay
            measurements reported by the  QOS option can be interpreted  (as
            absolute delay or only as  delay variation).  It is also  useful
            for determining  to what extent  several sources with  different
            clocks can be synchronized.

        Content:  32 bits
            The  content field  describes what  type  of data  is  contained
            within the RTP payload; it can be considered as  a next-protocol
            field.     That  field  and  all  bytes  following  it  are  not
            interpreted by RTP, but passed on to the next higher layer.

        Content-dependent data:  variable
            Content-dependent data may or may not appear in a  CDESC option.
            It is passed to the next layer and not interpreted by RTP.

        A CDESC  mapping changes  the interpretation  of a  given  'content'
        value starting  at the  packet containing  the CDESC  option.    The
        option only  affects  the  synchronization  source  of  the  packet.
        A  sender  should  refrain  from  changing  the  content  type   and
        flow index  of  a  mapping  defined by  external  means  such  as  a
        conference registry, conference  announcement protocol or  otherwise
        agreed-upon mapping.   Dynamic  changes to these  values may  result
        in misinterpretation of RTP payload if the packet(s) containing  the
        CDESC option are lost.

FDESC 34   Flow  content  description.     The  option  describes  the  flow
        corresponding to  the given  flow index,  drawn from  the  numbering
        space used by the  flow index in  the CDESC option.   Character  set
        and padding are the same as for  the SDESC option.  The text  string

4 Reverse Control


This section describes  a means  for the receiver  of RTP  protocol data  to
signal back  to the  sender or  a third  party (reverse  control).   Use  of
reverse control  packets is  optional.   Reverse  control packets  have  the
format shown below.  The packet is preceded by a packet length field  if and
only if the underlying transport layer does not support framing.  The packet
length field contains the number of octets within the packet, not  including
the packet length field itself.

The following options may be used within reverse control packets:


QOS 64   Quality of service measurement.   The source identifier (as in  the
        CSRC option)  is followed  by  the number  of packets  received  (16
        bits), the number of packets expected (16 bits), the minimum  delay,
        the maximum delay  and the average  delay.   The delay measures  are
        encoded as 6/10 NTP timestamps, that is, six bits encode the  number
        and seconds and 10 bits the fraction of a second.

Security Considerations


Security issues  need to  be discussed  before this  draft is  submitted  as
an RFC. RTP suffers  from the same security  deficiencies as the  underlying
protocols, for  example,  the  ability of  an  impostor to  fake  source  or
destination IP address.

The usage of network  addresses for identification  within the protocol  has
additional security implications.


  o false identification of content sources through the CSRC option

  o false synchronization source

  o BYE sent from site other than content source or  synchronization source;
    this can also be used for denial-of-service attacks


Impersonation and denial-of-service  attacks can be  made more difficult  by
providing digital signatures for all  or parts of a  message.  IP  multicast
provides no direct  means for  a sender  to know  all the  receivers of  the
data sent.  RTP  options make it easy for  all participants in a  conference
to identify themselves;  if deemed important  for a particular  application,
it is  the  responsibility  of  the application  writer  to  make  listening
without identification difficult.  It should be noted, however, that  within
an internet,  privacy  of  the payload  can  generally only  be  assured  by
encryption.

Details of the support for  authentication, encryption and integrity  checks
remain for further study.

This draft  is based  on discussion  within the  IETF audio-video  transport
working group  chaired by  Stephen Casner.    The current  protocol has  its
origins in the Network Voice Protocol  and the Packet Video Protocol  (Danny
Cohen and Randy Cole) and the protocol implemented by the 'vat'  application
(Van Jacobson and Steve McCanne).
