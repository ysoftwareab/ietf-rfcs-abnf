Internet-Draft        Using PPPoE in Wireless LANs          October 2003


1. Introduction

   Increased personal mobility and need for network coverage in open
   spaces or in places where cabling is difficult (such as airports,
   hospitals, warehouses or old buildings) has accelerated the
   development of several wireless solutions. Different technologies
   exist for transmitting data "over-the-air", for example GSM Packet
   Radio Service (GPRS), Bluetooth, and IEEE 801.11, also known as
   Wireless Ethernet or Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi).

   Studies such as [26], [25] and [24] demonstrated that the security
   architecture within Wi-Fi, named Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), is
   feeble and can be broken by motivated malicious users.  Moreover, WEP
   is not able to uniquely identify the user that is accessing the
   network, since it applies cryptography on a per-segment rather than
   per-user basis. Before IEEE 802.1x [2] protocol was announced and
   implemented, several workarounds has been adopted to overcome the
   issue, such as using VPN technologies (IPSec, PPTP, etc.).

   This document proposes the adoption of the Point-To-Point Protocol
   over Ethernet (PPPoE) [1] as an authentication methodology in
   wireless LAN.  PPPoE expecially targets Small Office Home Office
   (SOHO) users and ISP.

2. Wireless Standard IEEE 802.11b and Security Concerns

   Currently the most successful technology in wireless LANs is IEEE
   802.11 [8], due to its easy configuration, flexibility, and
   cost/performance ratio.  In particular, the extension named IEEE
   802.11b [9] (also known as 802.11 High Rate or Wi-Fi),  one of the
   1999 ratifications of the original 802.11 standard, provides wireless
   functionality comparable to Ethernet.

   IEEE 802.11 focuses mainly on Wireless LAN Medium Access Control
   (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications, but it defines also an
   optional security feature in the form of encryption, named the Wired
   Equivalent Privacy (WEP).  WEP was initially developed to give end
   users a protection comparable with that available on wired networks.
   Recent studies, such as [24] and [25], demonstrated, however, that a
   malicious user might gain access to the network by breaking the WEP
   keys and without ever needing to supply additional credentials after
   that. WEP is based on the RC4 [11] encryption algorithm, a function
   that generates a pseudo-random infinitive streaming cypher by
   suppling two arguments: the actual WEP key (referred to as K), that
   may be 40 or 104 bits long, and the Initial Vector (referred to as
   IV), that is 24 bits long. Each IEEE 802.11 frame payload contains
   the IV and cyphertext data: cyphertext data is obtained by applying
   XOR between the RC4 (IV, K) resulting stream and the clear text.



G. Paterno'                   Informational                     [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        Using PPPoE in Wireless LANs          October 2003


   Moreover, when a frame is transmitted a new IV is generated. As the
   IV has 16777216 possible values (2^24), the number of IVs would be
   exhausted (i.e. it would collide) every 5 hours by constantly
   transmitting at 11 Mb/s. With about 1500 IV collisions, and with a
   probabilistic attack to the RC4 algorithm, it is possible to decrypt
   the transmission and derive the original WEP key.  Document [26]
   describes in detail the weaknesses of the RC4 algorithm, while
   document [25] explains how such weaknesses can be used to break WEP.

   The Wired Equivalent Privacy, as it is deployed nowadays, gives
   therefore a security feeling to end-users which may be misleading.
   Actually, sensitive data, not encrypted anew in the presentation
   layer (e.g. through SSL), might be eavesdropped by motivated
   malicious users.

   Using layer 3 network addresses over the wireless LANs raises also
   some concerns. For example, the use of DHCP might be a disadvantage
   for those service providers unable to uniquely identify a specific
   user, typically for authorisation and accounting purposes.  It must
   be also considered that, once a malicious user is able to obtain the
   WEP key, DHCP immediately gives an IP address and network information
   to the intruder (e.g. DNS, WINS, routing, etc.).

   Many manufacturers of Access Points (AP) introduced an additional
   security feature known as MAC filtering.  APs were enabled to
   identify MAC addresses of the network cards allowed to access the AP
   itself. The use of MAC addresses presents some issues. First one of
   manageability: if a user changes his/her wireless adapter, for
   example to replace a broken one, he/she must contact the ISP and
   communicate his/her new MAC address.  Secondly, network cards MAC
   addresses can be easily changed by malicious users to find out the
   ones with access permissions and so gain access to the Wireless LAN.

3. Proposed Solution: PPPoE

3.1. The Authentication Layer

   In October 2001, IEEE released the 802.1x protocol that was initially
   developed to authenticate wired LAN, and then adopted and modified
   for use with Wireless LANs in order to address the security issues
   stated in the previous paragraph.  The IEEE 802.1x standard [2],
   which is based on Extensive Authentication Protocol Over Lan (EAPOL),
   is therefore able to authenticate users uniquely and deliver
   personalised services such as grouping of users in specific Virtual
   LANs.  When used over an IEEE 802.11 media, EAPOL is capable of
   creating and distributing per-session WEP keys through the EAPOL-Key
   frame.  More and more AP manufacturers are embracing the IEEE 802.1X
   standard, sometimes with proprietary extensions.

   Before IEEE 802.1x was available commercially, users tried to find a
   solution to the wireless security issues by adopting workarounds such
   as adopting VPN techlogogies (IPSec, PPTP, ecc...).  With the
   depolyement of IEEE 802.1x, workarounds might not be needed anymore
   for most of the users, because it combines authentication with a per-
   user encryption. Although IEEE 802.1x is the ideal choice for
   authenticating Wireless LANs users, it still requires an
   infrastructure (i.e. a RADIUS server) which is hard to maintain for
   SOHO users and small business that doesn't have dedicated IT
   resources. ISPs and mobile operators, instead, might not take
   advantage of 802.1x if they resells Virtual Private Dial-up Networks
   (VPDN) to smallest ISPs and other big customers: most of the VPDNs
   are based on the PPP protocol.

   This document proposes the adoption of PPPoE to authenticate wireless
   users.  ISPs already adopted PPPoE in order to resolve the
   authentication layer problem in the broadband world, i.e. ADSL and
   cable modems.  ADSL and cable technologies are able to emulate an
   ethernet network in their standard configuration. Although DHCP is
   easy to deploy for a Service Provider, and to configure from an user
   perspective, it does not provide a way to authenticate the user, and
   therefore cannot be used for accounting or authorization.  This need
   was solved with the introduction of the Point-To-Point over Ethernet
   protocol (PPPoE), described in [1].  Like the previous broadband
   technologies, 802.11 is able to emulate an ethernet network. The idea
   then is to apply PPPoE technology to Wireless LANs, as it is in ADSL
   and cable modems.

   The schema below summaries the proposed authentication layer and the
   resulting framework:

   PPPoE can be an easier solution to authenticate users in a SOHO and
   small business environment, and for use with legacy APs that do not
   support IEEE 802.1x. Furthermore, ISPs might benefit of the adoption
   of PPPoE because per-user services can be applied (e.g. fixed IP
   address, reserved bandwidth, etc...)  and because it makes simpler
   selling wholesale services and Virtual Private Dial-up Networks
   (VPDNs). By reusing proven technologies, e.g. Layer 2 Tunneling
   Protocol (L2TP) [19] or IPSec tunnels, Wireless LAN can extend their
   existing dial-up offerings.

   Two aspects must be considered while deploying PPPoE, i.e.  password
   exchange and the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size.  As specified
   in [1], the Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) option must not be negotiated
   to a size larger than 1492; Ethernet has a maximum payload size of
   1500 octets. The PPPoE header is 6 octets and the PPP protocol ID is
   2 octets, so that the PPP MTU must not be greater than 1492.
   However, based on the author's experience, some misbehaved VPN
   software packages add their own overhead to the MTU reported by the
   PPPoE interface, making the network packets too large to pass through
   a PPP over Ethernet connection: reducing the MTU by 32 bytes, i.e.
   reducing it to 1460, should generally suffice.

   Secondly, it is suggested that passwords might not be exchanged
   through the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) between the user
   and the PPPoE concentrator, because PAP transmits passwords in
   cleartext: a stronger protocol, such as MS-CHAPv2 [4], should be used
   instead.

3.2. The Encryption Layer

   Although network access can be secured through the adoption of PPPoE,
   data is still being sent in clear "over the air", with several
   concerns on users' privacy.  Data can be easily decrypted even when
   WEP is enabled on the Wireless LAN (please refer section 2).  Those
   who intend to adopt PPPoE as their authentication methodology can
   easily encrypt users' data by enabling ECP or MPPE on the PPPoE link.

   The Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) [12] is able to configure and
   to enable data encryption on both ends of the point-to-point link.
   ECP uses the same packet exchange mechanism as the Link Control
   Protocol (LCP) and, more generally, provides a framework for
   negotiating and applying parameters associated with encryption, e.g.
   choosing the algorithm.  At present, two algorithms has been defined,
   i.e. DESE-bis [13] and 3DESE [14].  Although ECP would be a better
   choice than MPPE to encrypt data, the author is not aware of any
   implementation of ECP, nor any associated option, and therefore ECP
   cannot be immediatly used to secure a Wireless LAN.

   The second option is to negotiate the Microsoft Point-To-Point
   Encryption Protocol (MPPE) [6] on the point-to-point link.  MPPE is a
   a PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) [15] option that implements
   encryption: Microsoft, in fact, created MPPE to secure its Point-to-
   Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) [23,21]. MPPE is an optional PPP
   extension that is negotiated within option 18 [10] in the Compression
   Control Protocol, and uses the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) RC4 [11]
   algorithm to provide data confidentiality. It was originally designed
   for encryption across a point-to-point link where packets arrive in
   the same order in which they were sent with little packet loss. MPPE
   can use 40-bit, 56-bit, or 128-bit encryption keys: the 40-bit key
   provides backward compatibility with old clients. The RFC [6]
   specifies also a stateless mode for MPPE, which changes the
   encryption keys on every packet: most implementations are capable of
   negotiating such an option and it is envisaged to use the stateless
   mode, when available, to overcome the RC4 algorithm issue on a long-
   lived PPPoE session.  The MPPE protocol itself is already available
   and it has been implemented in several devices and dial-in products.
   Therefore MPPE can be a simple, but efficient solution for companies,
   ISPs, and Mobile operators who wish to protect users' data.

   Whenever corporations need more data confidentiality, the author
   suggests to use an application-layer encryption, for example an
   SSL/TLS secured applications (HTTPS, IMAPS, etc...), on top of MPPE
   or ECP.

4. An Architecture Example

   In the previous chapter, the Wireless LAN has been compared to a
   dial-up infrastructure from a security perspective. Using this
   similarity, a typical corporate scenario can be analysed as an
   example.

        |              | Wireless Access Point(s) |

   +-------------+ (DMZ3) +------------------+

      |              |    +------------------+  +---------------+
      |              +----| Internal Proxy   |--| Radius Server |
      |                   +------------------+  +---------------+
   +----------+
   | Intranet |
   +----------+


   It has been mentioned that remote access systems, such as modems, are
   subject to "war-dialing", i.e. the attempt of a malicious user to
   guess the modem telephone number and access the corporate network.
   This is the reason why most of IT security policies do not allow
   connections using a modem and an analogue phone line to internally
   connected computers.

   Although, in a corporate security policy, dial-up users are usually



G. Paterno'                   Informational                     [Page 8]

   considered more "trusted" than global Internet users, they are
   however subject to an IP-based inspection (e.g. using firewalls or
   access lists) to limit access to corporate resources.

   In the example above, dial-up users are placed between two firewalls,
   in a zone named DMZ2. The front-end (FE) border firewall separates
   global Internet access from externally visible services (DMZ1), which
   contains for example DNS and Mail, and remote access users (DMZ2).
   DMZ2 is considered more secure than DMZ1: this zone is suitable for
   dial-up and Wireless LAN user: both access require the user to supply
   credentials to gain access to IP-based network.  In particular,
   wireless users are subject to PPPoE access verification and
   encryption (MPPE) through the PPPoE Access Concentrator (i.e. the
   PPPoE server)

   Once a dial-up/wireless user has obtained access, a back-end (BE)
   firewall connects the DMZ2 to another security zone (DMZ3) and the
   corporate Intranet. DMZ3 hosts a RADIUS server to authenticate users,
   an internal proxy and a VPN concentrator, which implements encrypted
   tunnels for users connecting from the Internet

   In a highly-secure environment, the security policies might only
   allow an encrypted data flow, e.g. through SSL, from wireless users
   in DMZ2 to the Intranet (HTTPS, IMAPS, etc...).  For specific
   unencrypted applications, e.g. TN3270E mainframe access, the policies
   might require a VPN secure tunnel to be established prior to
   accessing the service.
