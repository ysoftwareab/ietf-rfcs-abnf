   The "*", "(" and ")" symbols are interpreted as defined in [RFC5234].

   The EBMLPathAtom part of the EBMLElementPath MUST be equal to the
   name attribute of the EBML Schema.

   The starting PathDelimiter of the path corresponds to the root of the
   EBML Document.

   The EBMLElementOccurrence part is interpreted as an ABNF Variable
   Repetition.  The repetition amounts correspond to how many times the
   EBML Element can be found in its Parent Element.

   The EBMLMinOccurrence represents the minimum permitted number of
   occurrences of this EBML Element within its Parent Element.  Each
   instance of the Parent Element MUST contain at least this many
   instances of this EBML Element.  If the EBML Element has an empty
   EBMLParentPath then EBMLMinOccurrence refers to constraints on the
   occurrence of the EBML Element within the EBML Document.  If
   EBMLMinOccurrence is not present then that EBML Element has an
   EBMLMinOccurrence value of 0.  The semantic meaning of
   EBMLMinOccurrence within an EBML Schema is analogous to the meaning
   of minOccurs within an XML Schema.  EBML Elements with
   EBMLMinOccurrence set to "1" that also have a default value (see
   Section 11.1.5.8) declared are not REQUIRED to be stored but are
   REQUIRED to be interpreted, see Section 11.1.14.  An EBML Element
   defined with a EBMLMinOccurrence value greater than zero is called a
   Mandatory EBML Element.

   The EBMLMaxOccurrence represents the maximum permitted number of
   occurrences of this EBML Element within its Parent Element.  Each
   instance of the Parent Element MUST contain at most this many
   instances of this EBML Element.  If the EBML Element has an empty
   EBMLParentPath then EBMLMaxOccurrence refers to constraints on the
   occurrence of the EBML Element within the EBML Document.  If
   EBMLMaxOccurrence is not present then there is no upper bound for the
   permitted number of occurrences of this EBML Element within its
   Parent Element resp. within the EBML Document depending on whether
   the EBMLParentPath of the EBML Element is empty or not.  The semantic
   meaning of EBMLMaxOccurrence within an EBML Schema path is analogous
   to the meaning of maxOccurs within an XML Schema.

   The VariableParentOccurrence part is interpreted as an ABNF Variable
   Repetition.  The repetition amounts correspond to the amount of
   unspecified Parent Element levels there can be between the
   EBMLFixedParent and the actual EBMLElementPath.

   If the path contains an EBMLPathAtomRecursive part, the EBML Element
   can occur within itself recursively (see the Section 11.1.5.11).
   As an example, a "path" of "1*(\Segment\Info)" means the element Info
   is found inside the Segment elements at least once and with no
   maximum iteration.  An element SeekHead with path
   "0*2(\Segment\SeekHead)" may not be found at all in its Segment
   parent, once or twice but no more than that.
