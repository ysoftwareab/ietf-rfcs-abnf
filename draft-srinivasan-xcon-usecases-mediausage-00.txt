Internet-Draft                 mediausage                  November 2006


1.  Introduction

   The document clarifies the usages of various aspects to negotiating
   media, the associated controls for media and what they mean.  Current
   documents do not specifically cover details of how the various
   aspects of media related to conferencing integrate.  For example, [3]
   describes a mechanism to label media streams to identify them, but
   leaves the offer/answer model up to specific implementations.  And
   [7] and [2] describe mechanisms to control and notify state of
   conferences, but does not specifically discuss how the conferencing
   server ties specific media identifiers into signaling.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Media stream definitions

   The following section offers a description of the media elements in
   the schema in relation to XCON.  The XCON framework [1] describes a
   framework for establishing and participating in a centralized
   conference.

3.1.  Available media definition

   The available media section of the schema in the [2] contains a list
   of media stream outputs offered by the conferencing server each
   identified by a label.  A conferencing client joining the conference
   via the focus, typically subscribes to the conference event package
   [2].  The conference event package provides conferencing clients
   details of the conference including updates to conference state as
   described in the conference framework [1].

   The global streams in the conference as defined in the conferencing
   event package are identified via a label (in available media) as
   defined in [2].  The available media element is optional, except in
   the case where more than one stream of the same type is offered by
   the conferencing system.  A media label MUST be assigned if more than
   one stream of the same media type (like audio/video etc.) is
   available in the conference.  This is so that when a conferencing
   client receives more than one stream of the same type it should be
   able to relate the incoming stream to a specific available media to

   render appropriately.  Note that the label also serves one other
   purpose, it can be used to relate the media 'id' (as described in the
   subsequent sections) to the stream (m line) in the SDP.  The label is
   also unique within the conference-info context as defined in [2].  A
   label is typically created when a conference is scheduled, either via
   conference blueprints [1] or through some other means.  A new label
   MAY however appear in available media element (in the [7]) after the
   conference is active and clients may decide to render new streams as
   required (based on local policy).  When a conference is activated and
   a conferencing client receives a notification with the conference
   state, it would receive a notification with the list of media labels
   available in the conference.  The conferencing client may use this or
   may discover available media via signaling (for example, via SIP
   OPTIONS) to join the conference to receive media, provided it
   understands the context in which the specific media needs to be
   rendered.

3.2.  Per-user or per-endpoint media definitions

   Streams sent from a specific user's endpoint device is usually
   negotiated via some form of a signaling session.  The conferencing
   event package schema contains media XML elements within the users/
   user/endpoint elements.  The media XML element in [2] refers to a
   media stream of which there may be more than one.  Each media stream
   being sent from the conferencing client to the conference server is
   identified, within the conferencing event package, via an 'id' (refer
   [2], for more information).


4.  SDP negotiation and conferencing media usage

   This section explains the semantics of the media label and its usage
   within the XCON framework.  The media label in the conferencing data
   model or the conferencing event package maps to the media label
   defined within SDP in [3].  The media label is used to identify and
   associate streams in the SDP offer/answer model to the specific
   streams within conferencing.  This section will explain how this is
   done.

4.1.  Criteria for including media label attribute in SDP

   [3] suggests that the label may appear either in the offer or the
   answer and is used to identify the local stream either in the offer
   or the answer.  This section describes how conferencing servers may
   integrate label into the offer/answer model and associate it with the
   data model.  All conferencing clients and servers MUST follow the
   offer/answer model as described in [6].  The following sections only
   describe the usage of the media label in the context of conferencing



Srinivasan                Expires May 17, 2007                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 mediausage                  November 2006


   within the offer/answer model.

   The conferencing server SHOULD include a SDP 'label' attribute (as
   defined in [3]) for each stream in SDP sent from the conferencing
   server to the conferencing client (for example, in either the offer
   or the answer).  If there are two or more streams of the same media
   type (as defined in [2], Section 5.3.4 with type being the values
   registered for "media" of SDP [5]), the conferencing server MUST
   include the label for each stream in the SDP sent from the server.
   Furthermore, if present, the value for the 'label' attribute MUST
   match the label under available-media XML element in the data model
   [7].  Also, the 'label' MUST uniquely identify the stream within
   specific SDP offer or answer from the conferencing server.

4.1.1.  Mapping of media label (in SDP) to media id

   As the 'id' XML attribute defined in users/user/endpoint/media XML
   element in the data model [7] is not carried in SDP (or any signaling
   for that matter), the label attribute also serves the purpose of
   mapping the media 'id' defined in the data model to the media label
   defined in the data model.  What this means is that a conferencing
   client will not be able to negotiate different m-lines with the same
   label within the same conference via separate signaling sessions.

   [[ Note: Fixing this will require a new SDP attribute for conveying
   the media id in SDP ]]


5.  Media scenarios

5.1.  An example mixer model



    [to-mixer streams]                           [from-mixer streams]
                              |----mixer----|
    userid=23 , id=34     ----|             |--- label='10'
    userid=23 , id=35     ----|             |--- label='11'
    userid=23 , id=36     ----|             |--- label='12'
    userid=24 , id=24     ----|             |
    userid=24 , id=35     ----|             |
                              |-------------|


   The mixer shown above takes in some set of input streams and mixes
   them in some form or manner to produce output streams.  This document
   will not cover how the streams are grouped and/or mixed but will only
   show how the media inputs and outputs tie into the conferencing data



Srinivasan                Expires May 17, 2007                  [Page 5]

   model and signaling with an example.  For further information refer
   [2].

   The 'label' parameter above identifies the media output from the
   mixer and the streams to the mixer, from a specific user and
   endpoint, are identified by an 'id' in the conferencing data model.
   The label is unique throughout the conferencing data model.  The id
   is unique within the endpoint media element in the data model and is
   generated by the conferencing server.  Furthermore, each user is
   identified by a user identifier, refer [4].

   Consider that the label '10' is the stream containing the audio
   stream mix from all audio input streams offered to every participant.
   And '11' consists of a video mix that contains one of the layouts as
   decribed in the scenarios section.  And that '12' is an alternate mix
   of the video streams that is voice activated.

   And id's 34,35 and 36 for userid 23 are the user's main audio, main
   video stream and secondary video streams respectively.  And id's 24
   and 35 for userid 24 are the user's main audio and main video streams
   respectively.

   Let us consider that the mixer mixes the incoming video streams from
   the participants (going to the mixer) into both label '11' and label
   '12' streams.  And this is how the mixer is wired.  Also consider
   that the mixer accepts a single input stream at most from the client
   (in any sendrecv media stream), while rejecting the rest.  This is a
   specific mixer model described here, other mixer models may interpret
   the input streams differently and this is something that the mixer
   describes.  For more information on mixer templates and other
   representations within the mixer, refer to [template].  The next
   section will cover how this specific mix will appear in the offer/
   answer model in SDP.

   Note that the floor control aspects of the streams above are omitted
   here for brevity as floor control is clearly defined as being
   optional.

5.1.1.  Conference notification example

   The notification example given below corresponds to the mixer model
   defined above.  The available-media element lists the media labels as
   defined.  Note that the media labels '11' and '12' are defined with a
   status element of sendrecv.  The mixer model defined in a [template]
   extension should indicate what the mixer model for this is through a
   standards track or informational RFC.

   Using the offer/answer model described earlier, users Bob (userid=23)

Internet-Draft                 mediausage                  November 2006


   and Carl (userid=24) have joined the Focus and negotiated media
   streams as shown in the notification below.  It is useful to note
   that Bob has chosen to recv all video streams, while Carl has decided
   to opt on the secondary voice-activated video stream.

   It is quite possible for a conferencing system to expose Bob's input
   stream directly (without mixing) to the participants of the
   conference if it deems necessary as Bob has a role of presenter.  It
   may do so, for example, by creating a new label on-the-fly to expose
   this to the conferencing client.

   The notification below is what a presenter (Bob) may receive.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      -

5.2.  Common audio/video scenarios

5.2.1.  Muting an audio stream

5.2.1.1.  Mute all participants

   Muting all participants (in other words, activating the control or
   setting the value to 'true') in the conference typically means that
   for the entire duration where mute is applicable, all current and
   future participants of the conference are muted and will not receive
   any audio.  Typically this control is available to presenter or
   moderator roles in a conferencing system.  Since no audio is flowing
   to all participants, activating this control, in turn, may cause the

   conferencing focus to re-negotiate SDP with the various participants
   to stop media flowing as and when necessary.  This is entirely up to
   local policy.  Note that doing so may cause changes in conference
   state (with per-endpoint media elements and controls, their
   respective id's and their default states changing).

   In the example mixer, the control appears under available-media
   element as shown below.

        <available-media>
          <entry label="10">
            </entry>
            <!-- other elements omitted for
                     brevity -->
                    <mute enable="false">
                      <display-text xml:lang="en">Mute audio
                            outputs of this stream to all

                      <value>true</value>
             </mute>
          </entry>
          <!-- omitted -->
        </available-media>


5.2.1.2.  Muting to-mixer stream from a specific participant

   A mixer stream being sent from a participant to the mixer may be
   mixed in any form or manner.  For example, this may appear in
   multiple media outputs from the mixer (though not the case in this
   specific example).  Thus, activating this control would most
   certainly cause this input not appearing in any of the outputs from
   the mixer.  Similar to the previous scenario, activating this control
   may end up re-negotiating SDP.

   In the example mixer, the control appears under media element for
   each user and endpoint.  Bob's controls is shown below.

         t=0 0
         m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0
         a=label:10


   Note that even though the above SDP does not contain any information
   about the media id, the label provides a mapping of the specific
   m-line to the media section in the data model.

5.2.1.3.  Muting from-mixer stream to a specific participant

   This is a control on a specific mixer stream that is sent from a
   mixer to the participant negotiated via SDP.  This is mostly optional
   and many conferencing systems may instead opt to not implement such a
   control.  A client may instead, stop sending the media to the output
   device instead of activating this control to mute the stream.  Doing
   so will have the mixer still sending media packets towards the
   participant thus taking bandwidth on the network and CPU on the
   mixer.  Activating this control would stop media being send back from
   the mixer to the participant.  Similar to the previous scenarios,
   activating this control may end up re-negotiating SDP.

   In the example mixer, the control appears under media element for
   each user and endpoint.  Bob's controls is shown below.

5.2.2.  Pausing a video stream

5.2.2.1.  Pausing video to all participants

   Pausing the video being sent to all participants (in other words,
   activating the control or setting the value to 'true') in the
   conference typically means that for the entire duration where pause
   is applicable, all current and future participants of the conference
   would not receive video.  Typically this control is available to

   media is flowing to all participants, activating this control, in
