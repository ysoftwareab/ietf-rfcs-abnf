                                   ABSTRACT

 This memo is a registration of a [iCAL] component called "VCARD".  And
 defines that the "VCARD" component as the 'vcard entity' object as defined
 in [vCARD] and [LDAPVCARD].  This memo describes a way to include contact
 information in [iCAL] objects.  The contact information is included by the
 insertion of [vCARD] objects into [iCAL] objects. Also included is an
 extension to [LDAPVCARD] to allow [CAP] URLs.

 This memo does not define [iCAL] or [vCARD] objects.


 1.  Registration of VCARDURL parameter for iCalendar

 Parameter Name: VCARDURI

 Purpose: To specify the URL of a [vCARD] that  matches  the  property  value
 associated with the "VCARDURL" parameter.

 Value Type: URI

 Format  Definition:  The  property  parameter  is  defined  by the following
 notation:



 Royer                        Expires: March 2004                [Page 1]





 Internet Draft           Using VCARDs with iCalendar         October 3, 2003



      vcardparam = "VCARDURL" "=" uri


 Description: This parameter can be  specified  on  properties  with  a  CAL-
 ADDRESS  value type. The parameter identifies the location of a [vCARD] that
 describes in [vCARD] format information about the associated property value.
 Examples:

      ATTENDEE;VCARDURL="CID:<part3.msg.970415T083000@host.com>":
       MAILTO:jsmith@host.com

      ATTENDEE;VCARDURL="CAP:cal.example.com/user?search=vcard:123.vcf":
       CAP:Doug@Royer.com

      ATTENDEE;VCARDURL="https:cal.example.com/user?uid=vcard=123.vcf":
       CAP:Doug@Royer.com


 The  only  restriction  of the "VCARD" parameter value is that it point to a
 machine readable  [vCARD]  and  that  it  is  not  to  point  to  a  textual
 description  of the property value indented for a human to read. So it could
 be a [vCARD] object as part of a MIME  multipart  object,  an  FTP:,  HTTP:,
 HTTPS:,  CAP:,  FILE:,  or  other URI. Any implementation conforming to this
 specification must be able to parse the URI contents.



 2.  Extension of [iTIP] Restriction Tables

 The following is an extension of the [iTIP] restriction tables  to  allow  a
 [vCARD] object to be sent in [iCAL] objects.

 The  "Organizer"  may  include  a  "VCARD"  component  in  objects  sent  to
 "Attendees". They may  be  included  in  components  that  have  a  "METHOD"
 property with a "PUBLISH" or "REQUEST" values.

 For  implementations  that  conform  to  this specification the following is
 added to the restriction tables in [iTIP]:

   VEVENT:

     In:  [iTIP] Section 3.2.1, Page 16,
       After the line: METHOD    1   MUST BE "PUBLISH"

     VCARD             0 or 1  The "Organizers" VCARD may be included

     In:  [iTIP] Section 3.2.2, Page 18,
       After the line: METHOD    1   MUST BE "REQUEST"

     VCARD             0 or 1  The "Organizers" VCARD may be included


     In:  [iTIP] Section 3.2.3, Page 16,
       After the line: METHOD    1   MUST BE "REPLY"

 3.  When to include VCARDs

 There is no requirement that the "Organizer" or "Attendee" include
 a "VCARD" component. They should be included whenever the a change
 to the [vCARD] is deemed to be significant and in the original object
 sent to a new recipient or when sending an [INVITATION].

 3.1  VCARD and CAP

 With the addition of the "VCARD" component there is no major impact
 on [CAP] or [iCAL] as this memo defines the "VCARD" component as
 a new 'iana-comp' and therefore can be used and searched for like any
 other component.

 3.2  Adding CAP URLs to [LDAPVCARD]

 This memo also extends [LDAPVCARD] to allow the [CAP] URL 'cap:'
 in the 'FBURL' and 'CALURL' [vCARD] properties.

 3.3  CAP URI as FBURL property value

 The following is to be considered added to section "1.3" of [LDAPVCARD]:

  CAP URI -- If the URI is a CAP URI, then it is the address of
  a [CAP] server where a snapshot of the users calendar can be
  retrieived as the [CAP] anonymous UPN '@'. Only BOOKED and
  PUBLIC components will be returned. Use the "CAPURI" property for
  non anonymous access to the [CAP] server.



 3.4  CAP URI as CAPURI property value

 The following is to be considered added to section "1.3" of [LDAPVCARD]:

  a [CAP] server where a snapshot of the users calendar can be
  retrieived as the [CAP] anonymous UPN '@'. Only BOOKED and

  non anonymous access to the [CAP] server.
