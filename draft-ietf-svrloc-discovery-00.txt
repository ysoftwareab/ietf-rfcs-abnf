Abstract

   This document proposes a solution to the problem of finding
   information about that services are being offered at a particular
   Internet domain.  Therefore, it is possible for clients, using this
   approach, to located services in a domain with only prior knowledge
   of the domain name.

1. Rationale

   Currently, there is no one single way of discovering the network
   services and application protocols supported at a particular Internet
   domain.  The Domain Name System (DNS - [1,2]) provides some basic
   facilities for finding the hosts that offer particular services, such
   as DNS servers themselves (NS records), and mail exchangers (MX
   records).  However, neither mechanisms for locating arbitrary servers

   of arbitrary protocols nor search capabilities are provided.  By
   following the simple process proposed here, this lack can be avoided.

2. The process

   Once a domain name has been determined, clients that want to locate
   services in that domain should follow the following three step
   process:

   1. Look for SRV records (see [1]) in DNS associated with a service.
   2. Look for common aliases (see [2]) in DNS.
   3. Look for "service:" URLs in DNS. (see [3] and [4]).

   If a DNS lookup in steps 1 and 2 provides "service:" URL information
   as "Additional Information," then step 3 may be skipped.

3. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those
   naturally inherent in the DNS introduced by this draft.

4. Conclusion

   By following the above process, a client may be reasonably certain of
   determining whether a particular service is provided for a particular
   domain name, given the domain name.
