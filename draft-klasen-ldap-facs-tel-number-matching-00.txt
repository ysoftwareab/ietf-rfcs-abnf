Internet-Draft    facsimile telephone number matching           May 2003


1. Introduction

   LDAPv3 as defined in [RFC3377] is based on [ITU.X500.1993]. This
   version of X.500 does not define any matching rules for the Facsimile
   Telephone Number syntax. This omission has been corrected in a
   Technical Corrigendum [ITU.X520.2001.TC.1] to [ITU.X520.2001]. This
   document updates LDAPv3 accordingly by adding the two newly defined
   matching rules and updating the facsimileTelephoneNumber attribute
   type to use them.

2. Matching Rules

2.1 facsimileNumberMatch

   The facsimileNumberMatch rule compares an assertion value of the
   Telephone Number syntax to the first part of an attribute value of
   the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax. The corresponding ASN.1 type
   of this part is a PrintableString representing a telephone number.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the telephone-number part
   of the attribute value and the assertion value have the same number
   of characters and corresponding characters are the same, ignoring the
   case of letters, and ignoring space and `-' characters.

   The LDAP definition for the facsimileNumberMatch matching rule is:

   ( 2.5.13.63 NAME 'facsimileNumberMatch'
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 )

   The facsimileNumberMatch rule is an equality matching rule.

2.2 facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch

   The facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch rule compares an assertion value
   of the Substring Assertion syntax to the first part of an attribute
   value of the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax. The corresponding
   ASN.1 type of this part is a PrintableString representing a telephone
   number.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the substrings of the
   assertion value match disjoint portions of the telephone-number part
   of the attribute value in the order of the substrings in the
   assertion value, and an <initial> substring, if present, matches the
   beginning of the attribute value,  and a <final> substring, if
   present, matches the end of the attribute value.  A substring matches
   a portion of the attribute value if corresponding characters are the
   same, ignoring the case of letters, and ignoring space and `-'
   characters.

   The LDAP definition for the facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch matching
   rule is:

   ( 2.5.13.64 NAME 'facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch'
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 )

   The facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch rule is a substrings matching
   rule.

3. The facsimilefacsimileNumber Attribute Type

   A value of this Attribute Type is a facsimile number for a facsimile
   terminal (and, optionally, its parameters).

   ( 2.5.4.23 NAME 'facsimileTelephoneNumber'
   	EQUALITY facsimileNumberMatch
   	SUBSTR facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch
   	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 )

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax.

4. IANA Considerations

   It is requested that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   update the LDAP descriptors registry as indicated in the following
   templates:

   Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
   Descriptor (short name): facsimileNumberMatch
   Object Identifier: 2.5.13.63
   Person & email address to contact for further information:
   	Norbert Klasen <norbert.klasen@avinci.de>
   Usage: Matching Rule
   Specification: RFC XXXX
   Author/Change Controller: IESG


   Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
   Descriptor (short name): facsimileNumberSubstringsMatch
   Object Identifier: 2.5.13.64
   Person & email address to contact for further information:
   	Norbert Klasen <norbert.klasen@avinci.de>
   Usage: Matching Rule
   Specification: RFC XXXX
   Author/Change Controller: IESG
