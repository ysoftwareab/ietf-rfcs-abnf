Abstract

   This memo requests moving RFC 1863, A BGP/IDRP Route Server
   alternative to a full mesh routing, to Historic status.  This memo
   also Obsoletes RFC 1863.

1.  Request to Move RFC 1863 to Historic

   RFC 1863 [1] describes the use of route servers as an alternative to
   BGP/IDRP full mesh routing.

Internet-Draft            RFC 1863 to Historic                  May 2004


   In the modern terminology, the term "route server" refers to a
   designated, normal BGP speaker set up for specific purposes such as
   data collection or retrieval; such route servers do not implement RFC
   1863.  For clarity, in the context of this document the term "RFC
   1863 route server" is used to refer to a route server as specified in
   RFC 1863.

   Implementations of RFC 1863 route servers do not exist, and are not
   used as an alternative to full mesh routing.  Therefore the RFC 1863
   route server concept is considered extinct and RFC 1863 is requested
   to be moved to Historic status.

   The most common technique as an alternative to full mesh routing is
   to use BGP route reflectors [2].  Conferedations [3] and/or dividing
   the autonomous system to multiple private AS numbers have also been
   used.  IDRP itself has never been standardized by the IETF and can be
   considered obsolete.

   Other uses of (non-RFC1863) route servers, rather than as an
   alternative to full mesh routing as described by RFC 1863, are
   expected to continue be used for multiple purposes, but are out of
   the scope of this memo.

2.  Acknowledgements

   Jeffrey Haas, John Scudder, Paul Jakma, and Yakov Rekhter provided
   useful background information for the creation of this memo.

3.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 1863 has no security considerations.
