<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>  
   The success of the Internet is largely down to the elegant manner in which it
   shares capacity amongst all users while avoiding congestion collapse. However
   this relies on the cooperation of all end users to work efficiently. 
   Increasingly a small minority of users are able to grab larger and larger 
   shares of the network leading ISPs to impose arbitrary controls on traffic. 
   These controls set ISPs on a direct collision course with their customers and 
   the regulators.
   
</p>
<p>
   The root of the problem lies in the fact the ISPs are unable to see the most
   important information about the traffic – namely the amount of congestion 
   that traffic is going to cause in the network.   We propose congestion exposure 
   as a possible solution.  Every packet will carry an accurate prediction of the 
   congestion it expects to cause downstream. This memo sets out the motivations 
   for congestion exposure and introduces a strawman protocol designed to achieve 
   congestion exposure.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	The Internet has grown from humble origins to become a global phenomenon with 
	billions of end-users able to share the network and exchange data and more. 
	One of the key elements in this success has been the use of distributed algorithms 
	such as TCP that share capacity while avoiding congestion collapse. These algorithms 
	rely on the end-users altruistically reducing their transmission rate in response 
	to any congestion they see.
	
</p>
<p>
	In recent years ISPs have seen small minority of customers taking a large share of 
	the network by using protocols that open multiple simultaneous TCP connections and 
	by remaining connected for hours or even days at a time. This issue first came to 
	the fore with the advent of “always on” broadband connections. Frequently peer to 
	peer protocols have been held responsible <a class='info' href='#RFC5594'>[RFC5594]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and A. Cooper, &ldquo;Report from the IETF Workshop on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Infrastructure, May 28, 2008,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> but streaming video 
	traffic is becoming increasingly significant. In order to improve the network experience for the 
	majority of their customers, many ISPs have imposed controls on how their network’s 
	capacity is shared. Approaches include volume counting or charging, and application 
	rate limiting. Typically these traffic controls, whilst not impacting most customers, 
	set a restriction on a customer’s level of network usage, as defined in a “fair usage 
	policy”.
	
</p>
<p>
	We believe that such traffic controls seek to control the wrong quantity. What 
	matters in the network is neither the volume of traffic nor the rate of traffic, it 
	is the amount of congestion – congestion means that your traffic impacts other users, 
	and conversely that their traffic impacts you. So if there is little other traffic 
	there should be no restriction on the amount a user can send; restrictions should only 
	apply when others are sending a lot of traffic such that there is congestion. In fact 
	some of the current work at the IETF <a class='info' href='#LEDBAT'>[LEDBAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., &ldquo;Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and IRTF <a class='info' href='#CC-open-research'>[CC&#8209;open&#8209;research]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Welzl, M., Scharf, M., Briscoe, B., and D. Papadimitriou, &ldquo;Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> already reflect 
	this thinking. For example, a LEDBAT user reduces their transmission rate when they 
	detect an increase in end-to-end delay (as a measure of incipient congestion). However, 
	these techniques at the moment rely on voluntary, altruistic action by end users. 
	ISPs cannot enforce their use. This leads to our second point.
	
</p>
<p>
	We believe that congestion needs to be visible to network nodes and not just to the 
	end hosts as is the case today. By this we mean that a network can detect how much 
	congestion traffic causes between a point in the network and the destination 
	(“rest-of-path congestion”). This capability is new; today a network can only 
	detect how much congestion traffic has suffered between the source and a point in the 
	network. Such a capability enables an ISP to give incentives for the use, without 
	restrictions, of LEDBAT-like applications whilst perhaps restricting TCP and UDP ones. 
	
</p>
<p>
	So we propose a new approach which we call congestion exposure. We propose that 
	congestion information should be made visible at the IP layer, where it is accessible 
	by any application or transport protocol.  Once the information is exposed in this way, 
	it is then possible to use it to measure the true impact of any traffic on the network. 
	One use of this information would be to measure the congestion attributable to a given 
	application or user and thereby incentivise the use of protocols such as <a class='info' href='#LEDBAT'>[LEDBAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., &ldquo;Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> 
	which aim to reduce the congestion caused by bulk data transfers. {ToDo}It is possible to 
	imagine many other ways to use the exposed congestion information [maybe a forward ref?].

	</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd> Upstream congestion is defined as the congestion 
	that has already been experienced by a packet as it travels along its path. In other words at 
	any point on the path it is the congestion between that point and the source of the packet.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> Downstream congestion is defined as the congestion 
	that a packet still has to experience on the remainder of its path. In other words at any
	point it is the congestion still to be experienced as the packet travels between that point 
	and ts destination.

The Problem</h3>

<p>
    ISPs are facing a quandary – traffic is growing rapidly yet they know that any increases in 
	capacity will be of most benefit to the most aggressive users.  At the same time, traffic 
	patterns are changing significantly <a class='info' href='#Cisco-VNI'>[Cisco&#8209;VNI]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cisco Systems, inc., &ldquo;Cisco Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Methodology, 2008–2013,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and all the while increasing competition is 
	squeezing their profit margins.  Faced with these problems, some ISPs are seeking to reduce 
	what they regard as "heavy usage" in order to improve the service experienced by the majority 
	of their customers.

The Impact of Congestion</h3>

<p>
		As the Internet has grown, access rates have lagged behind those in the core.  However over recent
		years this has started to change.  Increasingly large numbers of
		people now access the network via broadband connections and the speed
		they can get is steadily increasing.  Alongside this have gone
		significant changes in traffic patterns.  We have been through a boom
		in large-scale data transfer by peer to peer networks and now are
		seeing an even larger boom in streaming media with applications such
		as the BBC iPlayer becoming increasingly popular.  The main effect of
		this has been that users now routinely see their network connections
		running slow in the evenings <a class='info' href='#OfCom'>[OfCom]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ofcom: Office of Communications, &ldquo;UK Broadband Speeds 2008: Research report,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Making Congestion Visible</h3>

<p>
		Unfortunately ISPs are only able to see limited information about the 
		traffic they forward. As we will see in section 3 they are forced to use 
		the only information they do have available which leads to myopic control 
		that has scant regard for the actual impact of the traffic or the underlying network 
		conditions. All their approaches are flawed because they measure the wrong 
		metric. The volume or rate of a given flow doesn’t directly affect other users, 
		but the congestion the flow causes does. This can be seen with a simple illustration. 
		A 5Mbps flow in an otherwise empty 10Mbps bottleneck causes no congestion and so 
		affects no other users. By contrast a 1Mbps flow entering a 10Mbps bottleneck that 
		is already fully occupied causes significant congestion and impacts every other user 
		sharing that bottleneck. So the real problem that needs to be addressed is how to 
		close this information gap. How can we expose congestion at the IP layer so that it 
		can be used as the basis for measuring the impact of any traffic on the network 
		as a whole?

ECN - a Step in the Right Directions</h3>

<p>
		Explicit Congestion Notification <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> allows routers to

Zhang, &ldquo;Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> by allowing the router to mark a packet
		with a Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint, rather than dropping
		it.  The probability of a packet being marked increases with the
		length of the queue and thus the rate of CE marks is a guide to the
		level of congestion at that queue.  This CE codepoint travels forward
		through the network to the receiver which then informs the sender
		that it has seen congestion.  The sender is then required to respond
		as if it had experienced a packet loss.  Because the CE codepoint is
		visible in the IP layer, this approach reveals the upstream
		congestion level for a packet.

<p>
		The choice of two ECT code-points in the ECN field <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>
		permitted future flexibility, optionally allowing the sender to
		encode the experimental ECN nonce <a class='info' href='#RFC3540'>[RFC3540]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Spring, N., Wetherall, D., and D. Ely, &ldquo;Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Signaling with Nonces,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> in the packet stream.
		This mechanism has since been included in the specifications of DCCP
		<a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The ECN nonce is an elegant scheme that allows the sender
		to detect if someone in the feedback loop - the receiver especially -
		tries to claim no congestion was experienced when in fact congestion
		led to packet drops or ECN marks.  For each packet it sends, the
		sender chooses between the two ECT codepoints in a pseudo-random
		sequence.  Then, whenever the network marks a packet with CE, if the
		receiver wants to deny congestion happened, she has to guess which
		ECT codepoint was overwritten.  She has only a 50:50 chance of being
		correct each time she denies a congestion mark or a drop, which ultimately will give her away.
		
</p>
<p>
		So Is ECN the Solution? Alas not - ECN does allow downstream nodes to measure the
		upstream congestion for any flow, but this is not enough. What is needed is knowledge of the
		downstream congestion level for which you need additional information
		that is still concealed from the network by design.

Volume Accounting</h3>

<p>
			Volume accounting is a passive technique that is often used to discriminate between users. The volume of traffic sent by a given 
			user or network is one of the easiest pieces of information to monitor in a network. Measuring the size of every packet and adding them up is a simple
			operation and to make it even easier, every IP packet carries its overall size in the header. Consequently this has long been a favoured measure used by
			operators to control their customers.
			
</p>
<p>
			The precise manner in which this volume information is used may vary. Typically ISPs may impose an overall volume cap on their customers (perhaps 10Gbytes a
			month). Alternatively they may decide that only a minority of heavy users are affected in some fashion.

			95th percentile of the peak rate of traffic crossing the border every month. Such bulk rate measurements are relatively easy to make.
			With a little extra effort it is possible to measure the rate of a given flow by using the 3-tuple of source and destination IP address and protocol
			number.

		then improved their equipment so that it could identify P2P traffic by the pattern of packets it sends. 
		This risks becoming an endless vicious cycle - an arms race that neither side can win. Furthermore such

Why Now?</h3>

<p>  
	Congestion has long been the key metric for deciding how fast a flow can safely send traffic.
	Since the late 1990s it has also been recognised as a key metric for measuring the impact of 
	traffic across the network <a class='info' href='#Kelly'>[Kelly]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kelly, F., Maulloo, A., and D. Tan, &ldquo;Rate control for communication networks: shadow prices, proportional fairness and stability,&rdquo; 1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. The IETF is keen to encourage 
	techniques that reduce congestion. For instance the <a class='info' href='#LEDBAT'>[LEDBAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., &ldquo;Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> working group 
	focuses on broadly applicable techniques that allow large amounts of data to be transmitted 
	without substantially affecting the delays experienced by other users and applications, thus
	reducing the congestion that traffic is causing.
	
</p>
<p>
   But users will only want to take advantage of such techniques if they actually improve their
   performance. As long as ISPs continue to use rate and volume as the key metrics for determining 
   when to control traffic there is no incentive to use LEDBAT or other protocols that reduce 
   congestion. We believe that congestion exposure gives ISPs the information they need to be 
   able to discriminate in favour of such low-congestion transports.

Requirements for a Solution</h3>

<p>
	This section lists the main requirements for any solution to this problem. We believe that a 
	solution that meets most of these requirements is likely to be better than one that doesn't.
		
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Allow both upstream and downstream congestion to be visible at the IP layer -- visibility at the IP layer allows congestion to be monitored in the heart of
		the network without deploying complicated and intrusive equipment such as DPI boxes. This gives several advantages:
</li>
<ol class="text">
<li>It enables policing of flows based on the congestion they are actually going to cause in the network.
</li>
<li>It allows the flow of congestion across ISP borders to be monitored.
</li>
<li>It supports a diversity of intra-domain and inter-domain congestion management practices. 
</li>
</ol>
<li>Support the widest possible range of transport protocols for the widest range of data types 
		(elastic, inelastic, real-time, background, etc) -- don't force a "universal rate adaptable policy" 
		such as TCP-friendliness <a class='info' href='#RFC3448'>[RFC3448]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M., Floyd, S., Padhye, J., and J. Widmer, &ldquo;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Be responsive to real-time congestion in the network.
</li>
<li>Avoid making assumptions about the behavior of specific applications (e.g. be application agnostic).
</li>
<li>Allow incremental deployment of the solution and ideally permit permanent partial deployment to increase chances of successful deployment.
</li>
<li>Support integrity of congestion notifications, thus making it hard for a user or network to distort the congestion signal.
</li>
<li>Be robust in the face of DoS attacks aimed at either congestion exposure itself, or at the network elements 
		implementing congestion exposure.
</li>
</ul><p>
	Many of these requirements are by no means unique to the problem of congestion exposure. Incremental deployment for instance is a critical requirement for any 
	new protocol that affects something as fundamental as IP. Being robust under attack is also a pre-requisite for any protocol to succeed in the real Internet 
	and this is covered in more detail in <a class='info' href='#cong_exp_prob_security'>Section&nbsp;9<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>.

A Strawman Congestion Exposure Protocol</h3>

<p>
	In this section we are going to explore a simple strawman protocol that would solve the congestion exposure problem. This protocol
	neatly illustrates how a solution might work. A practical implementation of this protocol has been produced and both simulations and 
	real-life testing show that it works. The protocol is based on a concept known as re-feedback <a class='info' href='#Re-fb'>[Re&#8209;fb]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., Jacquet, A., Di Cairano-Gilfedder, C., Salvatori, A., Soppera, A., and M. Koyabe, &ldquo;Policing Congestion Response in an Internetwork Using Re-Feedback,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and assumes that routers
	can measure their congestion level precisely.

</p>
<p>
	Re-feedback, standing for re-inserted feedback, is a system designed to allow end-hosts to reveal to the network information
	they have received via conventional feedback (for instance RTT or congestion level). 

</p>
<p>
	In our strawman protocol we imagine that packets have two "congestion" fields in their IP header. One field records the upstream congestion level
	and routers indicate their current congestion level by changing this field in every packet. So as the packet traverses 
	the network it builds up a record of the overall congestion along its path in this field. This data is then sent back to the sender who uses 
	it to determine its transmission rate. Using re-feedback the sender now inserts this congestion value in the second whole path congestion 
	field on every packet it sends out. Thus at any node downstream of the sender you can see the upstream congestion for the packet (the congestion thus far), the whole 
	path congestion (with a time lag of 1RTT) and can calculate the downstream congestion by subtracting one from the other. 
</p>
<p>
	So congestion exposure can be achieved by coupling congestion notification from routers with
	the re-insertion of this information by the sender. This establishes an information symmetry between users 
	and network providers which opens the door for the evolution of new congestion responses which are not bounded to a "universal rate 
	adaptation policy".

Use Cases</h3>

<p>
	Once downstream congestion information is revealed in the IP header it can be used for a number of purposes. Precise details
	of how the information might be used are beyond the scope of this document but this section will give an overview
	of some possible uses.
	
</p>
<p>
	It allows an ISP to accurately identify which traffic is having the greatest impact on the network and eitehr police 
	directly on that basis or use it to determine which users should be policed. It can form the basis of inter-domain 
	contracts between operators. It could even be used as the basis for inter-domain routing, thus encouraging operators 
	to invest appropriately in improving their infrastructure.
	
</p>
<p>  
	From Rich Woundy: "I would add a section about use cases. The primary use case would seem to be an "incentive environment that ensures 
	optimal sharing of capacity", although that could use a better title. Other use cases may include "DDoS mitigation", 
	"end-to-end QoS", "traffic engineering", and "inter-provider service monitoring". (You can see I am stealing liberally 
	from the motivation draft here. We'll have to see whether the other use cases are "core" to this group, or "freebies" 
	that come along with re-ECN as a particular protocol.)"
	
</p>
<p>
	My take on this is we need to concentrate on one or two major use cases. The most obvious one is using this to control user-behaviour and
	encourage the use of "congestion friendly" protocols such as LEDBAT.
	
	{Comments from Louise Krug} simply say that operators MUST turn off any kind of rate limitation for ledbat traffic and what 
	they might mean for the amount of bandwidth they see compared to a throttled customer? YOu could then extend that to say how 
	it leads to better QoS differentiation under the assumption that there is a broad traffic mix any way? Not sure how much detail 
	you want to go into here though?

	to the whole network (some ISPs view congestion level as a commerically sensitive concept). It needs to concentrate on two things in particular:
	DoS attacks that seek to corrupt the congestion information and how to ensure the honest declaration of information (both by 
	the network and by the end-user).

Conclusions</h3>

<p>
	Congestion exposure is the idea that traffic itself indicates to all nodes on its path how much 
	congestion it causes on the entire path. It is useful for network operators to police flows only 
	if they really cause congestion in the Internet instead of doing blind rate capping independently 
	of the congestion situation. This change would give incentives to users to adopt new transport 
	protocols such as LEDBAT which try to avoid congestion more than TCP does. Requirements for 
	congestion exposure in the IP header were summarized, one technical solution was presented, and 
	additional use cases for congestion exposure were discussed.
