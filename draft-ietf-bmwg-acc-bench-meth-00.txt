   ABSTRACT
   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and 
   being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is 
   necessary that the router be tested in these simultaneous 
   operational conditions, which is known as Stress Testing.  This 
   document provides the Methodology for performing Stress Benchmarking 
   of networking devices.  Descriptions of Test Topology, Benchmarks and 
   Reporting Format are provided in addition to procedures for 
   conducting various test cases.  The methodology is to be used with 
   the companion terminology document [6].

   1. Introduction
   Router testing benchmarks have consistently been made in a 
   monolithic fashion wherein a single protocol or behavior is 
   measured in an isolated environment.  It is important to know the 
   limits for a networking device's behavior for each protocol in isolation, 
   however this does not produce a reliable benchmark of the device's 
   behavior in an operational network.


   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic 
   and being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment 
   it is necessary to test that router in operational conditions by 
   simultaneously configuring and scaling network protocols and security 
   policies, forwarding traffic, and managing the device.  It is helpful 
   to accelerate these network operational conditions with Instability 
   Conditions [6] so that the networking devices are stress tested. 


   Stress Testing of networking devices provides the following benefits:
        1. Evaluation of multiple protocols enabled simultaneously as 
        configured in deployed networks
        2. Evaluation of System and Software Stability
        3. Evaluation of Manageability under stressful conditions       
        4. Identification of Software Coding bugs such as:
                a. Memory Leaks
                b. Suboptimal CPU Utilization
                c. Coding Logic 


   These benefits produce significant advantages for network operations:
        1.  Increased stability of routers and protocols
        2.  Hardened routers to DoS attacks
        3.  Verified manageability under stress
        4.  Planning router resources for growth and scale

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  July 2004


   This document provides the Methodology for performing Stress 
   Benchmarking of networking devices.  Descriptions of Test Topology, 
   Benchmarks and Reporting Format are provided in addition to 
   procedures for conducting various test cases.  The methodology is 
   to be used with the companion terminology document [6].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


   Terms related to Accelerated Stress Benchmarking are defined in [6].


   3. Test Setup


   3.1 Test Topologies


        Figure 1 shows the physical configuration to be used for the 
        methodologies provided in this document.  The number of
        interfaces between the tester and DUT will scale depending upon 
        the number of control protocol sessions and traffic
        forwarding interfaces.  A separate device may be required to
        externally manage the device in the case that the test equipment 
        does not support such functionality.  


        Figure 2 shows the logical configuration for the stress test 
        methodologies.  Each plane may be emulated by single or 
        multiple test equipment.

   3.2 Test Considerations


        The Accelerated Stress Benchmarking test can be applied in 
        service provider test environments to benchmark DUTs under 
        stress in an environment that is reflective of an operational 
        network.  A particular Configuration Set is defined and the 
        DUT is benchmarked using this configuration set and the Instability Conditions.  
        Varying Configuration Sets and/or Instability Conditions applied in an iterative
fashion can provide an accurate characterization of the DUT 
        to help determine future network deployments.   


   3.3 Reporting Format


   Each methodology requires reporting of information for test
   repeatability when benchmarking the same or different devices.  
   The information that are the Configuration Sets, Instability         
   Conditions, and Benchmarks, as defined in [6].  Example 
   reporting formats for each are provided below.

   4. Test Cases
   4.1 Failed Primary EBGP Peer 


        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when losing an EBGP 
        Peer from which most FIB routes have been learned.


        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Remove link to EBGP peer with most FIB routes 
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
           Conditions for next iteration


        Results
        It is expected that there will be significant packet loss
        until the DUT converges from the lost EBGP link.  Other DUT
        operation should be stable without session loss or sustained 
        packet loss.  Recovery time should not be infinite.


   4.2 BGP Route Explosion 


        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when there is BGP Route 
        Explosion experienced in the network.


        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Advertise 1M BGP routes from a single EBGP peer. 
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
           Conditions for next iteration


        Results
        It is expected that there will be no additional packet loss from
        the advertisement of duplicate routes from a single peer.  Other 
        DUT operation should be stable without session loss.  Recovery 
        time should not be infinite.

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  July 2004


   4.3 Persistent BGP Flapping 


        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when flapping BGP Peering 
        sessions for an infinite period.


        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Repeatedly flap an IBGP and an EBGP peering session
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions

        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
           Conditions for next iteration


        Results
        It is expected that there will be significant packet loss
        from repeated convergence events.  Other DUT operation should be 
        stable without session loss.  Recovery time should not be infinite.



   4.4 DoS Attack 


        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions while experiencing a 
        DoS attack.


        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Initiate DoS Attack against DUT
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
           Conditions for next iteration


        Results
        DUT should be able to defend against DoS attack without additional 
        packet loss or session loss.  Recovery time should be immediate.
        Open issue is definition of DoS Attack for the purpose of this test.
        COuld any DoS Attack be used?  Should DoS Attack be defined?

   5. Security Considerations
        Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
