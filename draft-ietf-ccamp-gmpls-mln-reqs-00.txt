  Abstract 
      
     Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been 
     related to environments hosting devices with a single switching 
     capability. The complexity raised by the control of such data 
     planes is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. 
      
     By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS 
     provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi-

     layered network of either a single switching technology or multiple 
     switching technologies. In GMPLS, a switching technology domain 
     defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is 
     referenced in this document as a multi-region network (MRN). When 
     referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of 
     either a single or multiple regions, this document uses the term, 
     Multi-layer Network (MLN). This draft defines a framework for GMPLS 
     based multi-region/multi-layer networks and lists a set of 
     functional requirements.

     Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS to handle multiple switching 
     technologies: packet switching, layer-two switching, TDM switching, 
     wavelength switching, and fiber switching (see [RFC3945]). The 
     Interface Switching Capability (ISC) concept is introduced for 
     these switching technologies and is designated as follows: PSC 
     (packet switch capable), L2SC (Layer-2 switch capable), TDM (Time 
     Division Multiplex capable), LSC (lambda switch capable), and FSC 
     (fiber switch capable). 
      
     Service providers may operate networks where multiple different 
     switching technologies exist. The representation, in a GMPLS 
     control plane, of a switching technology domain is referred to as a 
     region [HIER]. 
      
     A switching type describes the ability of a node to forward data of 
     a particular data plane technology, and uniquely identifies a 
     network region. A layer describes a data plane switching 
     granularity level (e.g. VC4, VC-12). A data plane layer is 
     associated with a region in the control plane (e.g. VC4 associated 
     to TDM, IP associated to PSC). However, more than one data plane 
     layer can be associated to the same region (e.g. both VC4 and VC12 
     are associated to TDM). Thus, a control plane region, identified by 
     its switching type value (e.g. TDM), can itself be sub-divided into 
     smaller granularity based on the bandwidth that defines the "data 
     plane switching layers" e.g. from VC-11 to VC4-256c. The Interface 
     Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) [GMPLS-RTG], identifying the 
     interface switching type, the encoding type and the switching 
     bandwidth granularity, enable the characterization of the 
     associated layers. 
      
     A network comprising transport nodes with multiple data plane 
     layers of either the same ISC or different ISCs, controlled by a 
     single GMPLS control plane instance, is called a Multi-Layer 
     Network (MLN). To differentiate a network supporting LSPs of 
     different switching technologies (ISCs) from a single region 
     network, a network supporting more than one switching technology is 
     called a Multi-Region Network (MRN). 
      
     MRNs can be categorized according to the distribution of the 
     switching type values amongst the LSRs: 
     - Network elements are single switching capable LSRs and 
       different types of LSRs form the network. 
     - Network elements are multi-switching capable LSRs i.e. nodes 
       hosting at least more than one switching capability. Multi-
     switching capable LSRs are further   
       classified as "simplex" and "hybrid" nodes (see Section 4.2).  
     - Any combination of the above two elements. A network composed   
       of both single and multi-switching capable LSRs.

     Since GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of 
     different switching capabilities, a single GMPLS instance may be 
     used to control the MRNs/MLNs enabling rapid service provisioning 
     and efficient traffic engineering across all switching capabilities. 
     In such networks, TE Links are consolidated into a single Traffic 
     Engineering Database (TED). Since this TED contains the information 
     relative to all the different regions/layers existing in the 
     network, a path across multiple regions/layers can be computed 
     using this TED. Thus optimization of network resources can be 
     achieved across multiple regions/layers. 
      
     Consider, for example, a MRN consisting of IP/MPLS routers and TDM 
     cross-connects. Assume that a packet LSP is routed between source 
     and destination IP/MPLS routers, and that the LSP can be routed 
     across the PSC-region (i.e. utilizing only resources of the IP/MPLS 
     level topology). If the performance objective for the LSP is not 
     satisfied, new TE links may be created between the IP/MPLS routers 
     across the TDM-region (for example, VC-12 links) and the LSP can be 
     routed over those links. Further, even if the LSP can be 
     successfully established across the PSC-region, TDM hierarchical 
     LSPs across the TDM region between the IP/MPLS routers may be 
     established and used if doing so enables meeting an operator's 
     objectives on network resources available (e.g. link bandwidth, and 
     adaptation port between regions) across the multiple regions. The 
     same considerations hold when VC4 LSPs are provisioned to provide 
     extra flexibility for the VC12 and/or VC11 layers in a MLN. 
      
     This document describes the requirements to support multi-
     region/multi-layer networks. There is no intention to specify 
     solution specific elements in this document. The applicability of 
     existing GMPLS protocols and any protocol extensions to the MRN/MLN 
     will be addressed in separate documents [MRN-EVAL].

  3. Positioning  
      
     A multi-region network (MRN) is always a multi-layer network (MLN) 
     since the network devices on region boundaries bring together 
     different ISCs. A MLN, however, is not necessarily a MRN since 
     multiple layers could be fully contained within a single region. 
     For example, VC12, VC4, and VC4-4c are different layers of the TDM 
     region.

  3.1. Data plane layers and control plane regions 
      
     A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable of 
     terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular format. 
     These resources can be used for establishing LSPs or connectionless 
     traffic delivery. For example, VC-11 and VC4-64c represent two 
     different layers. 
      
     From the control plane viewpoint, an LSP region is defined as a set 
     of one or several data plane layers that share the same type of 
     switching technology, that is, the same switching type. The 
     currently defined regions are: PSC, L2SC, TDM, LSC, and FSC regions. 
     Hence, an LSP region is a technology domain (identified by the ISC 
     type) for which data plane resources (i.e. data links) are 
     represented into the control plane as an aggregate of TE 
     information associated with a set of links (i.e. TE links). For 
     example VC-11 and VC4-64c capable TE links are part of the same TDM 
     region. Multiple layers can thus exist in a single region network. 
      
     Note also that the region is a control plane only concept. That is, 
     layers of the same region share the same switching technology and, 
     therefore, need the same set of technology specific signaling 
     objects.  
      
       
  3.2. Services 
      
     A service provider's network may be divided into different service 
     layers. The customer's network is considered from the provider's 
     perspective as the highest service layer. It interfaces to the 
     highest service layer of the service provider's network. 
     Connectivity across the highest service layer of the service 
     provider's network may be provided with support from successively 
     lower service layers. Service layers are realized via a hierarchy 
     of network layers located generally in several regions and commonly 
     arranged according to the switching capabilities of network devices. 
      
     For instance some customers purchase Layer 1 (i.e. transport) 
     services from the service provider, some Layer 2 (e.g. ATM), while 
     others purchase Layer 3 (IP/MPLS) services. The service provider 
     realizes the services by a stack of network layers located within 
     one or more network regions. The network layers are commonly 
     arranged according to the switching capabilities of the devices in 
     the networks. Thus, a customer network may be provided on top of 
     the GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer network. For example, a 
     Layer One service (realized via the network layers of TDM, and/or 
     LSC, and/or FSC regions) may support a Layer Two network (realized 
     via ATM VP/VC) which may itself support a Layer Three network 
     (IP/MPLS region). The supported data plane relationship is a data-
     plane client-server relationship where the lower layer provides a

     service for the higher layer using the data links realized in the 
     lower layer. 
      
     Services provided by a GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer network 
     are referred to as "Multi-region/Multi-layer network services". For 
     example legacy IP and IP/MPLS networks can be supported on top of 
     multi-region/multi-layer networks. It has to be emphasized that 
     delivery of such diverse services is a strong motivator for the 
     deployment of multi-region/multi-layer networks. 
      
  3.3. Vertical and Horizontal interaction and integration 
      
     Vertical interaction is defined as the collaborative mechanisms 
     within a network element that is capable of supporting more than 
     one switching capability and of realizing the client/server 
     relationships between them. Protocol exchanges between two network 
     controllers managing different regions are also a vertical 
     interaction. Integration of these interactions as part of the 
     control plane is referred to as vertical integration. The latter 
     refers thus to the collaborative mechanisms within a single control 
     plane instance driving multiple switching capabilities. Such a 
     concept is useful in order to construct a framework that 
     facilitates efficient network resource usage and rapid service 
     provisioning in carrier's networks that are based on multiple 
     switching technologies.  
      
     In a strict sense, horizontal interaction is defined as the 
     protocol exchange between network controllers that manage transport 
     nodes within a given region (i.e. nodes with the same switching 
     capability). For instance, the control plane interaction between 
     two LSC network elements is an example of horizontal interaction. 
     GMPLS protocol operations handle horizontal interactions within the 
     same routing area. The case where the interaction takes place 
     across a domain boundary, such as between two routing areas within 
     the same network layer, is currently being evaluated as part of the 
     inter-domain work [Inter-domain], and is referred to as horizontal 
     integration. Thus horizontal integration refers to the 
     collaborative mechanisms between network partitions and/or 
     administrative divisions such as routing areas or autonomous 
     systems. This distinction gets blurred when administrative domains 
     match layer boundaries. Horizontal interaction is extended to cover 
     such case. For example, the collaborative mechanisms in place 
     between two lambda switching capable areas relate to horizontal 
     integration. On the other hand, the collaborative mechanisms in 
     place in a network that supports IP/MPLS over TDM switching could 
     be described as vertical and horizontal integration in the case 
     where each network belongs to a separate area.

     A network comprising transport nodes with multiple data plane 
     layers of either the same ISC or different ISCs, controlled by a 
     single GMPLS control plane instance, is called a Multi-Layer 
     Network (MLN). A sub-set of MLNs consists of networks supporting 
     LSPs of different switching technologies (ISCs). A network 
     supporting more than one switching technology is called a Multi-
     Region Network (MRN). 
      
  4.1. Interface Switching Capability 
      
     The Interface Switching Capability (ISC) is introduced in GMPLS to 
     support various kinds of switching technology in a unified way 
     [GMPLS-ROUTING]. An ISC is identified via a switching type. 
      
     A switching type (also referred to as the switching capability 
     types) describes the ability of a node to forward data of a 
     particular data plane technology, and uniquely identifies a network 
     region. The following ISC types (and, hence, regions) are defined: 
     PSC, L2SC, TDM, LSC, and FSC. Each end of a data link (more 
     precisely, each interface connecting a data link to a node) in a 
     GMPLS network is associated with an ISC.  
      
     The ISC value is advertised as a part of the Interface Switching 
     Capability Descriptor (ISCD) attribute (sub-TLV) of a TE link end 
     associated with a particular link interface. Apart from the ISC, 
     the ISCD contains information, such as the encoding type, the 
     bandwidth granularity, and the unreserved bandwidth on each of 
     eight priorities at which LSPs can be established. The ISCD does 
     not "identify" network layers, it uniquely characterizes 
     information associated to one or more network layers. 
      
     TE link end advertisements may contain multiple ISCDs. This can be 
     interpreted as advertising a multi-layer (or multi-switching) TE 
     link end. 
   
  4.2. Multiple Interface Switching Capabilities 
      
     In a MLN, network elements may be single-switching or multi-
     switching type capable nodes. Single-switching type capable nodes 
     advertise the same ISC value as part of their ISCD sub-TLV(s) to 
     describe the termination capabilities of their TE Link(s). This 
     case is described in [GMPLS-ROUTING].  
      
     Multi-switching capable LSRs are classified as "simplex" and 
     "hybrid" nodes. Simplex and Hybrid nodes are categorized according 
     to the way they advertise these multiple ISCs: 
      
     - A simplex node can terminate links with different switching 
     capabilities each of them connected to the node by a single link 
     interface. So, it advertises several TE Links each with a single 
   
                            Expires July 2006                  [Page 7] 
   
   
   
                  draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mln-reqs-00.txt    January 2006              
   
   
   
     ISC value as part of its ISCD sub-TLVs. For example, an LSR with 
     PSC and TDM links each of which is connected to the LSR via single 
     interface. 
      
     - A hybrid node can terminate links with different switching 
     capabilities terminating on the same interface. So, it advertises 
     at least one TE Link containing more than one ISCDs with different 
     ISC values. For example, a node comprising of PSC and TDM links, 
     which are interconnected via internal links. The external 
     interfaces connected to the node have both PSC and TDM capability. 
      
     Additionally TE link advertisements issued by a simplex or a hybrid 
     node may need to provide information about the node's internal 
     adaptation capabilities between the switching technologies 
     supported. That is, the node's capability to perform layer border 
     node functions.  
      
      
  4.2.1. Networks with multi-switching capable hybrid nodes 
      
     The network contains at least one hybrid node, zero or more simplex 
     nodes, and a set of single switching capable nodes. 
       
     Figure 5a shows an example hybrid node. The hybrid node has two 
     switching elements (matrices), which support, for instance, TDM and 
     PSC switching respectively. The node terminates two PSC and TDM 
     links (Link1 and Link2 respectively). It also has internal link 
     connecting the two swtching elements.  
      
     The two switching elements are internally interconnected in such a 
     way that it is possible to terminate some of the resources of, say, 
     Link2 and provide through them adaptation for PSC traffic 
     received/sent over the PSC interface (#b). This situation is 
     modeled in GMPLS by connecting the local end of Link2 to the TDM 
     switching element via an additional interface realizing the 
     termination/adaptation function. Two ways are possible to set up

  4.3. Integrated Traffic Engineering (TE) and Resource Control  
      
     In GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer networks, TE Links are 
     consolidated into a single Traffic Engineering Database (TED). 
     Since this TED contains the information relative to all the layers 
     of all regions in the network, a path across multiple layers 
     (possibly crossing multiple regions) can be computed using the 
     information in this TED. Thus optimization of network resources 
     across the multiple layers of the same region and multiple regions 
     can be achieved.  
      
     These concepts allow for the operation of one network layer over 
     the topology (that is, TE links) provided by other network layer(s) 
     (for example, the use of a lower layer LSC LSP carrying PSC LSPs). 
     In turn, a greater degree of control and inter-working can be 
     achieved, including (but not limited too):  
     - dynamic establishment of Forwarding Adjacency LSPs (see Section 
     4.3.3)  
     - provisioning of end-to-end LSPs with dynamic triggering of FA 
     LSPs 
      
     Note that in a multi-layer/multi-region network that includes 
     multi-switching type capable nodes, an explicit route used to 
     establish an end-to-end LSP can specify nodes that belong to 
     different layers or regions. In this case, a mechanism to control 
     the dynamic creation of FA LSPs may be required. 
      
     There is a full spectrum of options to control how FA LSPs are 
     dynamically established. It can be subject to the control of a 
     policy, which may be set by a management component, and which may 
     require that the management plane is consulted at the time that the 
     FA LSP is established. Alternatively, the FA LSP can be established 
     at the request of the control plane without any management control.  
      
  4.3.1. Triggered signaling  
      
     When an LSP crosses the boundary from an upper to a lower layer, it 
     may be nested into a lower layer FA LSP that crosses the lower 
     layer. From signaling perspective, there are two alternatives to 
     establish lower layer FA LSP: static and dynamic.  Decision will be 
     made either by the operator or automatically  using features like 
     TE auto-mesh, for instance. If such a lower layer LSP does not 
     already exist, the LSP may be established dynamically. Such a 
     mechanism is referred to as "triggered signaling".

  4.3.2. FA-LSP 
      
     Once an LSP is created across a layer, it can be used as a data 
     link in an upper layer.  
      
     Furthermore, it can be advertised as a TE-link, allowing other 
     nodes to consider the LSP as a TE link for their path computation 
     [HIER]. An LSP created either statically or dynamically by one 
     instance of the control plane and advertised as a TE link into the 
     same instance of the control plane is called a FA-LSP. The TE-link 
     associated to an FA-LSP is called an FA. An FA has the special 
     characteristic of not requiring a routing adjacency (peering) 
     between its ends yet still guaranteeing control plane connectivity 
     between the FA-LSP ends based on a signaling adjacency. A FA is a 
     useful and powerful tool for improving the scalability of GMPLS 
     Traffic Engineering (TE) capable networks. 
      
     The aggregation of LSPs enables the creation of a vertical (nested) 
     LSP Hierarchy. A set of FA-LSPs across or within a lower layer can 
     be used during path selection by a higher layer LSP. Likewise, the 
     higher layer LSPs may be carried over dynamic data links realized 
     via LSPs (just as they are carried over any "regular" static data 
     links). This process requires the nesting of LSPs through a 
     hierarchical process [HIER]. The TED contains a set of LSP 
     advertisements from different layers that are identified by the 
     ISCD contained within the TE link advertisement associated with the 
     LSP [GMPLS-ROUTING].  
       
  4.3.3. Virtual network topology (VNT)  
      
     A set of one or more of lower-layer LSPs provides information for 
     efficient path handling in upper-layer(s) of the MLN, or, in other 
     words, provides a virtual network topology to the upper-layers. For 
     instance, a set of LSPs, each of which is supported by an LSC LSP, 
     provides a virtual network topology to the layers of a PSC region, 
     assuming that the PSC region is connected to the LSC region. Note 
     that a single lower-layer LSP is a special case of VNT. The virtual 
     network topology is configured by setting up or tearing down the 
     LSC LSPs. By using GMPLS signaling and routing protocols, the 
     virtual network topology can be adapted to traffic demands. 
      
     Reconfiguration of the virtual network topology may be triggered by 
     traffic demand change, topology configuration change, signaling 
     request from the upper layer, and network failure. For instance, by 
     reconfiguring the virtual network topology according to the traffic 
     demand between source and destination node pairs, network 
     performance factors, such as maximum link utilization and residual 
     capacity of the network, can be optimized [MAMLTE]. Reconfiguration 
     is performed by computing the new VNT from the traffic demand 
     matrix and optionally from the current VNT. Exact details are

     outside the scope of this document. However, this method may be 
     tailored according to the Service Provider's policy regarding 
     network performance and quality of service (delay, loss/disruption, 
     utilization, residual capacity, reliability). 
      
  5. Service networks provided over MRN/MLN 
      
     A customer network may be provided on top of a server MRN/MLN 
     network (such as a transport network) which is operated by a 
     service provider. For example legacy IP or IP/MPLS networks can be 
     provided on top of GMPLS packet or optical networks [IW-MIG-FW]. 
     The relationship between the networks is a client/server 
     relationship and, such services are referred to as "MRN/MLN 
     services". 
      
     The customer network may be provided either as part of the MRN/MLN 
     or in a separate network instance distinct from the MRN/MLN. There 
     could also be an administrative boundary between the customer 
     network and the MRN/MLN operated by the service provider. All 
     requirements described in this document SHOULD be applicable if 
     there is an administrative boundary between the customer network 
     and the MRN/MLN operated by service provider. 
      
     Impact on the customer network design, operation, and 
     administration SHOULD be minimized. For instance, the design for 
     address assignment and IGP area division should be kept independent 
     from the underlying MRN/MLN. 
      
     The MRN/MLN SHOULD provide mechanisms to allow an administrative 
     boundary between the customer network and the MRN/MLN. 
      
  6. Requirements  
      
  6.1. Scalability  
      
     The MRN/MLN relies on a unified traffic engineering and routing 
     model. The TED in each LSR is populated with TE-links from all 
     layers of all regions. This may lead to a huge amount of 
     information that has to be flooded and stored within the network. 
     Furthermore, path computation times, which may be of great 
     importance during restoration, will depend on the size of the TED.  
      
     Thus MRN/MLN routing mechanisms MUST be designed to scale well with 
     an increase of any of the following:  
      - Number of nodes  
      - Number of TE-links (including FA-LSPs)  
      - Number of LSPs  
      - Number of regions and layers 
      - Number of ISCDs per TE-link.

  6.2. LSP resource utilization  
      
     It MUST be possible to utilize network resources efficiently. 
     Particularly, resource usage in all layers SHOULD be optimized as a 
     whole (i.e. across all layers), in a coordinated manner, (ie taking 
     all layers into account). The number of lower-layer LSPs carrying 
     upper-layer LSPs SHOULD be minimized as much as possible (Note that 
     multiple LSPs may be used for load balance) . Unneccesary lower-
     layer LSPs SHOULD be avoided.  
      
  6.2.1. FA-LSP release and setup 
      
     Statistical multiplexing can only be employed in PSC and L2SC 
     regions. A PSC or L2SC LSP may or may not consume the maximum 
     reservable bandwidth of the FA LSP that carries it. On the other 
     hand, a TDM, or LSC LSP always consumes a fixed amount of bandwidth 
     as long as it exists (and is fully instantiated) because 
     statistical multiplexing is not available.  
      
     If there is low traffic demand, some FA LSPs, which do not carry 
     any LSP may be released so that resources are released. Note that 
     if a small fraction of the available bandwidth is still under use, 
     the nested LSPs can also be re-routed optionally using the make-
     before-break technique. Alternatively, the FA LSPs may be retained 
     for future usage. Release or retention of underutilized FA LSPs is 
     a policy decision.  
       
     As part of the re-optimization process, the solution MUST allow 
     rerouting of FA LSPs while keeping interface identifiers of 
     corresponding TE links unchanged.  
      
     Additional FA LSPs MAY also be created based on policy, which might 
     consider residual resources and the change of traffic demand across 
     the region. By creating the new FA LSPs, the network performance 
     such as maximum residual capacity may increase.  
      
     As the number of FA LSPs grows, the residual resource may decrease. 
     In this case, re-optimization of FA LSPs MAY be invoked according 
     the policy.  
      
     Any solution MUST include measures to protect against network 
     destabilization caused by the rapid set up and tear down of LSPs as 
     traffic demand varies near a threshold. 
   
  6.2.2. Virtual TE-Link 
      
     It may be considered disadvantageous to fully instantiate (i.e. 
     pre-provision) the set of lower layer LSPs since this may reserve 
     bandwidth that could be used for other LSPs in the absence of the 
     upper-layer traffic.

     However, in order to provision upper-layer LSPs across the lower-
     layer, the LSPs MAY still be advertised into the upper-layer as 
     though they had been fully established. Such TE links that 
     represent the possibility of an underlying LSP are termed "virtual 
     TE-link". Note that this is not a mandatory (MUST) requirement 
     since even if there are no LSPs advertised to the higher layer, it 
     is possible to route an upper layer LSP into a lower layer based on 
     the lower layer's TE-links and making assumptions that proper 
     hierarchical LSPs in the lower layer will be dynamically created as 
     needed. 
      
     If an upper-layer LSP that makes use of a virtual TE-Link is set up, 
     the underlying LSP MUST be immediately signaled in the lower layer 
     if it has not been established.  
      
     If virtual TE-Links are used in place of pre-established LSPs, the 
     TE links across the upper-layer can remain stable using pre-
     computed paths while wastage of bandwidth within the lower-layer 
     and unnecessary reservation of adaptation ports at the border nodes 
     can be avoided.  
      
     The concept of VNT can be extended to allow the virtual TE-links to 
     form part of the VNT. The combination of the fully provisioned TE-
     links and the virtual TE-links defines the VNT across the lower 
     layer.  
      
     The solution SHOULD provide operations to facilitate the build-up 
     of such virtual TE-links, taking into account the (forecast) 
     traffic demand and available resource in the lower-layer.  
      
     Virtual TE-links MAY be modified dynamically (by adding or removing 
     virtual TE links) according to the change of the (forecast) traffic 
     demand and the available resource in the lower-layer.  
      
     Any solution MUST include measures to protect against network 
     destabilization caused by the rapid changes in the virtual network 
     topology as traffic demand varies near a threshold. 
      
     The VNT can be changed by setting up and/or tearing down virtual TE 
     links as well as by modifying real links (i.e. the fully 
     provisioned LSPs).  
      
     The maximum number of virtual TE links that can be configured 
     SHOULD be well-engineered.  
      
     How to design the VNT and how to manage it are out of scope of this 
     document and will be treated in a companion document on solution.

  6.3. LSP Attribute inheritance  
      
     TE-Link parameters SHOULD be inherited from the parameters of the 
     LSP that provides the TE link, and so from the TE links in the 
     lower layer that are traversed by the LSP.  
     These include:  
     - Interface Switching Capability  
     - TE metric  
     - Maximum LSP bandwidth per priority level  
     - Unreserved bandwidth for all priority levels   
     - Maximum Reservable bandwidth  
     - Protection attribute  
     - Minimum LSP bandwidth (depending on the Switching Capability)  
      
     Inheritance rules MUST be applied based on specific policies. 
     Particular attention should be given to the inheritance of TE 
     metric (which may be other than a strict sum of the metrics of the 
     component TE links at the lower layer) and protection attributes.  
      
  6.4. Verification of the LSP  
      
     When the LSP is created, it SHOULD be verified that it has been 
     established before it can be used by an upper layer LSP. Note, this 
     is not within the GMPLS capability scope for non-PSC interfaces. 
      
  6.5. Disruption minimization  
      
     When reconfiguring the VNT according to a change in traffic demand, 
     the upper-layer LSP might be disrupted. Such disruption MUST be 
     minimized.  
      
     When residual resource decreases to a certain level, some LSPs MAY 
     be released according to local or network policies. There is a 
     trade-off between minimizing the amount of resource reserved in the 
     lower layer LSPs and disrupting higher layer traffic (i.e. moving 
     the traffic to other TE-LSPs so that some LSPs can be released). 
     Such traffic disruption MAY be allowed but MUST be under the 
     control of policy that can be configured by the operator. Any 
     repositioning of traffic MUST be as non-disruptive as possible (for 
     example, using make-before-break).  
      
  6.6. Stability  
      
     The path computation is dependent on the network topology and 
     associated link state. The path computation stability of an upper 
     layer may be impaired if the VNT changes frequently and/or if the 
     status and TE parameters (TE metric for instance) of links in the 
     virtual network topology changes frequently.

     In this context, robustness of the VNT is defined as the capability 
     to smooth changes that may occur and avoid their propagation into 
     higher layers. Changes of the VNT may be caused by the creation 
     and/or deletion of several LSPs.  
      
     Creation and deletion of LSPs MAY be triggered by adjacent layers 
     or through operational actions to meet traffic demand change, 
     topology change, signaling request from the upper layer, and 
     network failure. Routing robustness SHOULD be traded with 
     adaptability with respect to the change of incoming traffic 
     requests.  
      
     A full mesh of LSPs MAY be created between every pair of border 
     nodes of the PSC region. The merit of a full mesh of PSC TE-LSPs is 
     that it provides stability to the PSC-level routing. That is, the 
     forwarding table of an PSC-LSR is not impacted by re-routing 
     changes within the lower-layer (e.g., TDM layer). Further, there is 
     always full PSC reachability and immediate access to bandwidth to 
     support PSC LSPs. But it also has significant drawbacks, since it 
     requires the maintenance of n^2 RSVP-TE sessions, which may be 
     quite CPU and memory consuming (scalability impact). Also this may 
     lead to significant bandwidth wasting if LSP with a certain amount 
     of reserved bandwidth is used. 
     Note that the use of virtual TE-links solves the bandwidth wasting 
     issue, and may reduce the control plane overload. 
      
  6.7. Computing paths with and without nested signaling  
      
     Path computation MAY take into account LSP region and layer 
     boundaries when computing a path for an LSP. For example, path 
     computation MAY restrict the path taken by an LSP to only the links 
     whose interface switching capability is PSC.  
      
     Interface switching capability is used as a constraint in computing 
     the path. A TDM-LSP is routed over the topology composed of TE 
     links of the same TDM layer. In calculating the path for the LSP, 
     the TE database MAY be filtered to include only links where both 
     end include requested LSP switching type. In this way hierarchical 
     routing is done by using a TE database filtered with respect to 
     switching capability (that is, with respect to particular layer). 
      
     If triggered signaling is allowed, the path computation mechanism 
     MAY produce a route containing multiple layers/ regions. The path 
     is computed over the multiple layers/regions even if the path is 
     not "connected" in the same layer as the endpoints of the path 
     exist. Note that here we assume that triggered signaling will be 
     invoked to make the path "connected", when the upper-layer 
     signaling request arrives at the boundary node.

     The upper-layer signaling request may contain a loose ERO, and the 
     boundary node is responsible for creation of the lower-layer FA-LSP. 
     When the boundary node receives the signaling setup request and 
     determines that it has to expand the loose ERO content by creating 
     the lower-layer FA-LSP, it will create the lower layer FA-LSP 
     accordingly. Once the lower-layer LSP is established, the ERO 
     contents for the upper-layer signaling setup request are expanded 
     to include the lower-layer FA-LSP and signaling setup for the 
     upper-layer LSP are carried in-band of the lower-layer LSP.  
      
     The upper-layer signaling request may contain a strict ERO 
     specifying the lower layer FA-LSP route. In this case, the boundary 
     node is responsible for decision as to which it should use the path 
     contained in the strict ERO or it should re-compute the path within 
     in the lower-layer. 
      
     Even in case the lower-layer FA-LSPs are already established, a 
     signaling request may also be encoded as loose ERO. In this 
     situation, it is up to the boundary node to decide whether it 
     should a new lower-layer FA-LSP or it should use the existing 
     lower-layer FA-LSPs. 
      
     We should note that the lower-layer FA-LSP can be advertised just 
     as an FA-LSP in the upper-layer or an IGP adjacency can be brought 
     up on the lower-layer FA-LSP.

      nodes  
      
     The MRN/MLN can consist of single-switching type capable and multi-
     switching type capable nodes. The path computation mechanism in the 
     MLN SHOULD be able to compute paths consisting of any combination 
     of such nodes.  
      
     Both single switching capable and multi-switching (simplex or 
     hybrid) capable nodes could play the role of layer boundary. 
     MRN/MLN Path computation SHOULD handle TE topologies built of any 
     combination of single switching, simplex and hybrid nodes  
      
  6.9. Advertisement of the available adaptation resource  
      
     A hybrid node SHOULD maintain resources and advertise the resource 
     information on its internal links, the links required for vertical 
     (layer) integration. Likewise, path computation elements SHOULD be 
     prepared to use the availability of termination/adaptation 
     resources as a constraint in MRN/MLN path computations to reduce 
     the higher layer LSP setup blocking probability because of the lack

     of necessary termination/ adaptation resources in the lower 
     layer(s). 
   
     The advertisement of the adaptation capability to terminate LSPs of 
     lower-region and forward traffic in the upper-region is REQUIRED, 
     as it provides critical information when performing multi-region 
     path computation. 
      
     The mechanism SHOULD cover the case where the upper-layer links 
     which are directly connected to upper-layer switching element and 
     the ones which are connected through internal links between upper-
     layer element and lower-layer element coexist (See section 4.2.1).
