2.  Abstract

While the X.500 standards [X500] define many useful attribute types and
object classes, they do not define a person object class that meets the
requirements found in today's Internet and Intranet directory service
deployments.  We define a new object class called inetOrgPerson for use
in LDAP and X.500 directory services that extends the X.521 standard
organizationalPerson class to meet these needs.

INTERNET-DRAFT    The LDAP inetOrgPerson Object Class      11 March 1998


3.  Background and Intended Usage

The inetOrgPerson object class is a general purpose object class that
holds attributes about people.  The attributes it holds were chosen to
accommodate information requirements found in typical Internet and
Intranet directory service deployments.  The inetOrgPerson object class
is designed to be used within directory services based on the LDAP
[RFC2251] and the X.500 family of protocols, and it should be useful in
other contexts as well.

The attribute type and object class definitions are written using the
BNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and ObjectClassDescription given in
[RFC2252].  Lines have been folded for readability.

Attributes that are referenced but not defined in this document are
included in the standard and pilot attribute definitions [RFC2256] or in
the labeledURI object class [RFC2079]


4.  New Attribute Types Used in the inetOrgPerson Object Class


4.1.  Vehicle license plate tag.

This multivalued field is used to record the license plate tags associ-
ated with an individual.

( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.1
    NAME 'carLicense'
    DESC 'vehicle license plate tag'
    EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
    SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
    SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
)


4.2.  Department number

Code for department to which a person belongs.  This can also be
strictly numeric (e.g., 1234) or alphanumeric (e.g., ABC/123).
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.2
    NAME 'departmentNumber'
    DESC 'identifies a department within an organization'
    EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
    SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
    SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
)

INTERNET-DRAFT    The LDAP inetOrgPerson Object Class      11 March 1998


4.3.  Employee Number

Numeric or alphanumeric identifier assigned to a person, typically based
on order of hire or association with an organization.  Single valued.
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.3
    NAME 'employeeNumber'
    DESC 'numerically identifies an employee within an organization'
    EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
    SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
    SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
    SINGLE-VALUE
)


4.4.  Employee Type

Used to identify the employer to employee relationship.  Typical values
used will be "Contractor", "Employee", "Intern", "Temp", "External", and
"Unknown" but any value may be used.
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.4
    NAME 'employeeType'
    DESC 'a person's type of employment'
    EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
    SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
    SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
)


4.5.  Preferred Language

Used to indicate an individual's preferred written or spoken language.
This is useful for international correspondence or human-computer
interaction.  Values for this attribute type MUST conform to the defini-
tion of the Accept-Language header field defined in [RFC2068] with one
exception:  the sequence "Accept-Language" ":" should be omitted.  This
is a single valued attribute type.
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.39
    NAME 'preferredLanguage'
    DESC 'a person's preferred written or spoken language'
    EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
    SUBSTRINGS caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
    SYNTAX 'DirectoryString'
    SINGLE-VALUE
)

4.6.  User S/MIME Certificate

S/MIME [RFC1847] signed message with a zero-length body.  This attribute
is to be stored and requested in binary form, as
'userSMIMECertificate;binary'.  It contains the person's entire certifi-
cate chain and the signed attribute that describes their algorithm capa-
bilities, stored as an octetString.  If available, this attribute is
preferred over the userCertificate attribute for S/MIME applications.
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.40
    NAME 'userSMIMECertificate'
    DESC 'signed message used to support S/MIME"
    SYNTAX 'octetString'
)


4.7.  User PKCS #12

PKCS #12 [PKCS12] provides a format for exchange of personal identity
information.  When such information is stored in a directory service,
the userPKCS12 attribute should be used. This attribute is to be stored
and requested in binary form, as 'userPKCS12;binary'.  The attribute
values are PFX PDUs stored as octetStrings.
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.216
    NAME 'userPKCS12'
    DESC 'PKCS #12 PFX PDU for exchange of personal identity information'
    SYNTAX 'octetString'
)



5.  Definition of the inetOrgPerson Object Class

The inetOrgPerson represents people who are associated with an organiza-
tion in some way.  It is a structural class and is derived from the
organizationalPerson class.
( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.2
    NAME 'inetOrgPerson'
    SUP organizationalPerson
    STRUCTURAL
    MAY (
        audio $ businessCategory $ carLicense $ departmentNumber $
        employeeNumber $ employeeType $ givenName $ homePhone $
        homePostalAddress $ initials $ jpegPhoto $ labeledURI $
        mail $ manager $ mobile $ pager $
        photo $ roomNumber $ secretary $ uid $ userCertificate $
        x500uniqueIdentifier $ preferredLanguage $ userSMIMECertificate $
        userPKCS12
    )

)


For reference, we list the following additional attribute types which
are inherited from organizationalPerson (which in turn is derived from
the person object class):
    MUST (
        objectClass $ sn $ cn
    )
    MAY (
        description $ seeAlso $ telephoneNumber $ userPassword $
        destinationIndicator $ facsimileTelephoneNumber $
        internationaliSDNNumber $ l $ ou $
        physicalDeliveryOfficeName $ postOfficeBox $ postalAddress $
        postalCode $ preferredDeliveryMethod $ registeredAddress $
        st $ street $ telephoneNumber $ teletexTerminalIdentifier $
        telexNumber $ title $ x121Address $
    )

7.  Security Considerations

Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive informa-
tion about the real-world objects they represent, which can be people,
organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws regarding
the publication of information about people.

Transfer of cleartext passwords are strongly discouraged where the
underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.


8.  Acknowledgments

The Netscape Directory Server team created the inetOrgPerson object
class based on experience and customer requirements.  Anil Bhavnani and
John Kristian in particular deserve credit for all of the early design
work.

Many members of the Internet community, in particular those in the IETF
ASID and LDAPEXT groups, also contributed to the design of this object
class.
