   o  If I2NSF User wants to apply rules about blocking malicious users,
      it is a tremendous burden to apply all of these rules to NSFs one
      by one.  This problem can be resolved by standardizing the
      capabilities of NSFs.  If I2NSF User wants to block malicious
      users with IPv6, I2NSF User sends the rules about blocking the
      users to Network Operator Mgmt System.  When the Network Operator
      Mgmt System receives the rules, it sends that rules to appropriate
      NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer Mgmt System A and NSF-1 in
      Developer Mgmt System B) which can support the capabilities (i.e.,
      IPv6).  Therefore, I2NSF User need not consider NSFs where to
      apply the rules.

   o  If NSFs find the malicious packets, it is a tremendous burden for
      I2NSF User to apply the rule about blocking the malicious packets
      to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by standardizing
      the capabilities of NSFs.  If NSFs find the malicious packets with
      IPv4, they can ask the Network Operator Mgmt System to alter
      specific rules and/or configurations.  When the Network Operator
      Mgmt System receives the rules for malicious packets, it inspects
      whether the rules are reasonable and sends the rules to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-1 in Developer Mgmt System A and NSF-1
      and NSF-n in Developer Mgmt System B) which can support the
      capabilities (i.e., IPv4).  Therefore, the new rules can be
      applied to appropriate NSFs without control of I2NSF USer.

   o  If NSFs of Service Function Chaining (SFC) [i2nsf-sfc] fail, it is
      a tremendous burden for I2NSF User to reconfigure the policy of
      SFC immediately.  This problem can be resolved by periodically
      acquiring information of appropriate NSFs of SFC.  If SFF needs
      information of Web Application Firewall for SFC, it can ask the
      Network Operator Mgmt System to acquire the location information
      of appropriate Web Application Firewall.  When the Network
      Operator Mgmt System receives requested information from SFF, it
      sends location information of Web Application Firewall to the SFF.
      Therefore, the policy about the NSFs of SFC can be periodically
      updated without control of I2NSF USer.
