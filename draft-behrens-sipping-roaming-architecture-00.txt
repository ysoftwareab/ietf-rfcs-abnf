           Abstract 
            
           This draft describes an authentication mechanism which can 
           be used to enable users of VoIP to globally roam between any 
           number of ITSPs (Internet Telephony Service Providers) 
           without needing to have a prior customer or billing 
           relationship with all of them. This enables profiles and one- 
           line-billing. 
           Providers using this authentication mechanism do neither 
           need full-mesh 
           trust relationships or roaming agreements with every other 
           possible provider nor do they need to rely on a centralized 
           brokerage entity to process calls. 
           The Home Network (HN), which handles all AAA for a user 
           attempting to use an ITSP's service is determined through a 
           unique identifier submitted by the user. This Network Access 
           Identifier [RFC2486] contains information about the trust 
           domain or trust realm the user belongs to. Based on a simple 
           discovery mechanism a provider can establish a trust path to 
           this home network. Once this is 
           established, the provider can authenticate the user and 
           check his credit with the home network. Accounting and rate 
           information will be sent to the home network for mediation 
           and processing.

           1. Introduction 
            
            More and more ISPs are beginning to add VoIP to their service 
           portfolio. The last years have seen the merging of IP-based telephony 
           and switched line telephony (both mobile and fixed-line) in the sense 
           that users of VoIP want to be able to call a PSTN or PLMN number as 
           well as being reachable under a home PSTN or PLMN number. Roaming 
           between ISPs has not developed to a large degree. 
           With the advent of voice communication becoming an important service, 
           this will become more relevant. Users will want to use VoIP for their 
           telephony and they will want to do this wherever they are located. The 
           authors believe that one way to address this is to leverage a user’s 
           existing customer and billing relationship with his home telephony 
           provider.Users make use of this when signing up for ad-hoc service with 
           a visited ITSP. The ITSP verifies the existing billing relationship and 
           receives authorization of a certain amount of credit the home network 
           is willing to underwrite. 
           Based on the security architecture described here, mutual trust can be 
           established and the user can both place VoIP calls through his visited 
           network as well as being reachable under home number and URI. 
            
           2. Requirements 
            
            The term ‘Roaming Capability’ has been defined in 
            [RFC2486]. 
            One aim of this document is to provide an architecture by 
            which Roaming Capability can be assured by a federation 
            of independent VoIP providers. In the world of IP-related 
            protocols little attention has been given to this issue. 
            Requirements for global roaming for WLAN users have been 
            described by J. Caron in [CARON.1]. He also outlined a 
            simple DNS-based method in [CARON.2]. 
            The Roaming Scenario addressed here is as follows: 
            - The principal with the NAI of alice@biloxi.com sends a REGISTER 
              request to the SIP registrar of atlanta.com. atlanta.com in this 
              case is Alice’s ‘Visited Network’ (VN). biloxi.com is her home 
              network. 
            - Alice wants to use her VN to place authenticated and    secure 
              VoIP calls. 
            - Alice wants to be reachable both under her home URI as well as 
              under a URI assigned by the VN. 
            - Alice provides her NAI to her VN’s SIP registrar. 
            - The VN 
                 o asserts that Alice’s Home Network signs Alice’s identity and 
                   authorizes a credit amount greater 0 
                 o asserts that Alice’s HN is a trusted entity 
            - atlanta.com assigns Alice a temporary Address of Record (AOR) URI 
              as well as a valid contact address from within its own name space.

           Internet Draft SIP February 8, 2003 


            - Alice registers with her HN using the newly assigned Contact 
              address as the Contact. 
            - Alice’s SUA can place outgoing call either under the temporary URI 
              assigned by the VN or her home URI at biloxi.com. 
            - Alice is reachable both under her home-AOR as well as the visiting-
              AOR. Assuming Alice’s HN provides PSTN break-in, Alice is also 
              reachable under her telephone number known to her buddies. 
            - All calls placed by Alice for the duration of this registration are 
              accounted to Alice’s HN. 
             
           3. Architecture 
             
            The architecture is based on a model that is user-centric in that it 
           assumes for each principal or user to have one Home Network with which 
           he has a valid billing relationship.  
           This entity can authenticate the user based on his NAI and is willing 
           to underwrite credit as well as receive CDRs for further settlement. 
           This HN corresponds to the ‘Authentication Service’ described in 
           [PETERSON.1]. Basing the architecture on a user-centric model based on 
           a NAI, greatly reduces the number of billing relationships in a roaming 
           environment as well allowing incumbent HNs, such PSTN or PLMN providers 
           [RFC2486], to leverage their existing customer relationships.  
           New emerging operators can benefit from this, because they can deliver 
           their services to any user with a valid NAI, knowing that they can bill 
           the user’s HN up to the credit amount underwritten.  
           HNs can benefit by charging for this service. This potentially creates 
           a win-win situation between incumbent operators, who hold the trust and 
           billing relationships, and emerging ITSPs who wish to be able to 
           attract as many users as possible, without the financial and 
           bureaucratic overhead involved in setting up a documented and secure 
           billing relation with each of their users. 
            
            The architecture consists of 
              1. Peers: entities participating in a roamable VoIP infrastructure 
              2. Security Architecture: the Security architecture, which 
                 describes the trust relationships as well as security 
                 mechanisms used. 
              3. Signaling Protocol: Signaling is based on the Session Initiation 
                 Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  
              4. Accounting infrastructure: Both Authentication andAuthorization 
                 are covered by the Security Architecture and/or the Signaling 
                 Protocol. Accounting is based on 
                    - the Authentication and Authorization signed by the HN and 
                      accepted by the VN. 
                    - hub-and-spoke trust relationships from the participating 
                      operators to a Settlement Entity (SE). 
            This document proposes an architecture, which fulfils these 
           requirements by making use of pre-existing trust relationships. 
           The architecture is strongly influenced by work done by J. Peterson 
           [PETERSON.1] and [RFC3325] on one hand and the work of Aboba et. al 
           [RFC2486],[RFC2194] on the other hand.

            The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
            "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
            "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
            interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 
             
           6. Security Architecture 
            
            The proposed architecture is based on the assumption that 
            all entities, participating in the execution of a call, 
            establish a mutual Trust Domain (TD) for at least the 
            duration of that call. The term ‘Trust Domain’ is used in 
            the sense described in [RFC3324]. 
            Such a TD can be of permanent nature or established 
            within the context of one or more transactions. 
            Based on this definition of Trust Domain the architecture 
            described here, can be separated into two distinct 
            layers: 
            1. Verification or Establishment of a common Trust Domain based on 
              existing and derived direct Trust Relationships. 
            2. Use the mechanisms provided by this TD – Spec(T) – to assert the 
              validity of VoIP calls and their related document trail. 
            Section 6.1 and 6.2 will outline the direct Trust Relationships 
           assumed in the scope of this document. Section 7 outlines how a common 
           Trust Domain is established. Section 8 provides example call flows that 
           combine the mechanisms to demonstrate how the requirements are 
           fulfilled. 
             
            6.1 Trust Relationships 
            For SIP-based VoIP to become commercially accepted, 
            providers need to be able to 
             -  account and bill for their services 
             -  be able to cooperate with other VoIP providers in routing and 
                 signaling calls. 
            Both of these requirements assume trust relationships 
            between the user(s) being served as well as between the 
            operators cooperating during the call. 
            In order to achieve critical mass, it needs to be easy 
            for providers to cooperate in a flexible ad-hoc fashion 
            in placing and routing their calls. Authentication should 
            be based on a globally unique identifier, so one 
            principal has one AAA and billing relationship. This 
            unique identifier needs to specify his home domain of trust to other 
           entities. Within his DoT, the identifier 
            needs to identify his specific principal identity. 
            Authentication and authorization of a user can be 
            transparent because the user uses only one set of 
            credentials wherever he may be. Within this document we 
            assume credentials based on exchange of PKI certificates. 
            The model operates on direct trust relationships. A user 
            has an a-priori trust relationship with his home network. 
            Visited network and home network establish trust based on 
            exchange and verification of certificates. 
            The user and the visited network establish trust through

           Internet Draft SIP February 8, 2003 


            the mechanisms described in this document. 
            Once the user and the VN have established a trust 
            relationship, which is based on the VN knowing that the 
            HN can be charged for the credit amount authorized, the 
            user is fully authenticated and authorized and can use 
            the VN’s services. 
            This is even though a-priori trust or billing 
            relationship exists between the authenticated user and 
            the serving provider. 
             
            6.2 Trust Relationships between Providers and Settlement 
            Entity 
             
            Inter-operator accounting is still within the scope of 
            the architecture described here. We assume that billing 
            is based on a settlement and clearing entity. This entity 
            provides CDR-aggregation, settlement, clearing and billing 
           functionalities to the participating providers. 
            Where there is more than one such entity, we assume an 
            existing trust relationship between them. This 
            architecture assumes the existence of such an entity, 
            e.g. based on the Open Settlement Protocol (OSP) defined 
            by the ETSI [TS102.321]. It is also assumed that each 
            provider has its own trust relationship with the 
            Settlement Agency. It should be noted that the model 
            explicitly does not use any of the authentication or 
            routing functionalities proposed in that specification. 
            In the architecture presented here, OSP is strictly used 
            for aggregation of CDRs and settlement among operators. 
            The authors think that the fully integrated position 
            taken by the ETSI does not fulfil the more organic and 
            fluid environment of the upcoming VoIP industry. 
            
           7. Actors and Mechanisms 
            
           7.1 Actors 
            
            The actors (players) are as follows: 
             
             -  The Service User (User): A user wanting to use VoIP telephony 
                 both for inbound as well as outbound calls. A user is uniquely 
                 identified based on his NAI, which identifies him as a user of 
                 his home domain. A mechanism of the location of the AAA server 
                 serving that home domain is assumed. 
             -  The Visited Network (VN): the VN is the network a user uses when 
                 roaming. He wants to use that networks services while being 
                 billed by his HN. Roaming should be transparent. This means that 
                 the user should not need an a-priori trust relationship with the 
                 VN. It also means that he should be reachable under his home AOR 
                 and home telephone number no matter who is roaming provider is. 
             -  The Home Network (HN): The Home Network has two functions: 
                  .   act as a home AAA server for the User. 
                  .   act as the home VoIP network for the User. 
            
           7.2 Mechanisms 
            
            The mechanism is as follows: 
             -  A user registers with the VN (atlanta.com in the call flow 
                 given). The user submits his NAI in new header field ‘P-NAI’. 
                 The user submits a bogus URI in both the From and the To header. 
             -  The VN recognizes the registration as a P-NAI registration and 
                 sends back a “401 Unauthorized” response, with both the From and

           Internet Draft SIP February 8, 2003 


                 the To URI set to the temporary URI that will be assigned to the 
                 user upon successful authentication and authorization. 
             -  The User submits the credentials belonging to the NAI specified, 
                 e.g. his signed public key in the next register message. 
             -  The VN requests authentication and authorization of the user 
                 from the home network. This can either be done through the AAA 
                 architecture or future extensions to the SIP protocol. 
             -  The HN authenticates the user and authorizes a certain amount of 
                 credit. The HN includes a one-time token, which he encrypts 
                 using the user’s public key in the return message. The HN signs 
                 the user’s credentials and the encrypted token together with the 
                 amount authorized. At this point authentication is established. 
                 Authorization is still pending. 
             -  The VN sends the user the encrypted token in a new header field 
                 ‘P-NAI-Token’ in the response to the user’s registration 
                 request. 
             -  The user decrypts the ‘P-NAI-Token’ with his private key. He 
                 then encrypts it with his VN’s public key.  
             -  The user requests a call using an INVITE message with the ‘P-
                 NAI-Token’ (encrypted with the VN’s certificate) inserted in the 
                 header. 
             -  The VN decrypts the token and encrypts it using the HN’s public 
                 key. He uses this token in an authorization request sent to the 
                 HN. 
             -  The HN decrypts the received token and compares it with the 
                 locally generated token. If they match, all necessary trust 
                 relationships have been established. 
                  .   The HN has authenticated the user to the VN. 
                  .   The VN now trusts the user based on the VN’s trusting 
                  the HN. 
                  .   The user trusts the VN. This is established by the VN 
                      possessing the clear text P-NAI-Token. 
                  .   The HN receives proof of this trust and can therefore 
                      authorize the VN to bill up to the credit amount given 
            
           8. Call Flow  
            
           Client is located in the foreign ITSP-Network and wants to be 
           authenticated by his home network. 
           Within that flow a trust relationship between the ITSPs is established.
