Abstract

   This document defines Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based networks.  This
   document proposes an extension to the GBOND-MIB which defines a set
   of common objects for managing multi-pair bonded Digital Subscriber
   Line (xDSL) interfaces.  In particular, it describes objects used for

   managing parameters of the ATM based xDSL multi-pair bonded
   interfaces, as defined in ITU-T recommendations G.998.1.  The
   Management Information Base (MIB) modules specific to the other
   bonding technologies are defined in GBOND-ETH-MIB and GBOND-TDIM-MIB
   respectively.

Internet-Draft               G.Bond ATM MIB                 January 2007


1.  Introduction

   The xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, allows a service provider to provide
   high bandwidth services to business and residential customers over
   multiple xDSL lines, with greater speed and resiliency, than the
   service over a single xDSL line, bridging the gap between xDSL and
   fiber-based transport.

   There are three xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes, also known under
   collective name G.Bond: ATM based, Ethernet Based and time division
   inverse multiplexing (TDIM) based

   The ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, specified in ITU-T G.998.1
   recommendation [G.998.1], which defines a method for bonding (or
   aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in
   multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link
   carrying an ATM stream.  This specification can be viewed as an
   evolution of the legacy Inverse Multiplexing over ATM (IMA)
   technology [af-phy-0086], applied to xDSL with variable rates on each
   line/bearer channel.  As with other bonding schemes, ATM bonding also
   allows bonding of up to 32 individual sub-layers with variable rates,
   providing common functionality for the configuration, initialization,
   operation and monitoring of the bonded link.

   The MIB module defined in this document defines a set of managed
   objects specific to ATM based multi-pair bonding technology.  This
   MIB module extends the common objects specified in the GBOND-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] modules.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Management Model

3.1.  The DSL Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the DSL Forum technical report Management
   Framework for xDSL Bonding [WT-159], defining a management model and
   a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.

3.2.  Mapping of ITU-T G.998.1 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [G.998.1] and managed objects defined in this
   document and in associated MIB modules, i.e., the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

3.4.  Relation to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and and G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

3.4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond ATM port forms a part of a multi-pair xDSL bonded interface.
   It is managed using the MIB objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].
   In particular the MIB object ifIndex is used to index instances of
   G.Bond ATM ports in a system.

3.4.2.  Relationship to G.BOND MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular is describes the bonding management, port and channel
   configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and GBOND-TDIM-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/TDIM port.

3.5.  IANA Considerations

   A new IANAifType value of g9981 SHALL be defined by the IANA [1] in
   the [IANAifType-MIB]IANAifType-MIB module, before this document is
   published as an RFC.

3.6.  Structure of GBOND-ATM-MIB

   _EdNote: Add structure based on the conclusion on fault and
   performance reporting_

3.7.  Conventions Used

   _EdNote: To be added; abbreviation and textual conventions used in
   this MIB_

       DESCRIPTION
         "The objects in this MIB module are used to manage the
         multi-pair bonded xDSL Interfaces using ATM inverse
         multiplexing, defined in ITU-T recommendation G.998.1
         (G.Bond/ATM).

         This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with GBOND-MIB
         module, common to all G.Bond technologies.

         The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

5.  Security Considerations

   The readable objects in the GBOND-ATM-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be
   comprised of multiple Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade
   copper, located in the same bundle with other pairs belonging to
   another operator/customer, it is theoretically possible to eavesdrop
   to a G.Bond transmission, simply by "listening" to a cross-talk from
   the bonded pairs, especially if the parameters of the G.Bond link in
   question are known.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),



Beili, et al.             Expires July 13, 2007                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               G.Bond ATM MIB                 January 2007


   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
