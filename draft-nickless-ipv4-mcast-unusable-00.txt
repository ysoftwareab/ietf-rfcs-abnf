Abstract 
    
   Due to the mapping of IPv4 Multicast addresses to Ethernet MAC 
   addresses, and the prevalence of IGMP snooping switches, certain 
   addresses in the IPv4 Multicast Group Address range 224.0.0.0/4 MUST 
   NOT be used.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

Background 
 
   IPv4 multicast [MCAST] is an internetwork service that allows IPv4 
   datagrams sent from a source to be delivered to one or more 
   interested receiver(s).  That is, a given source sends a packet the 
   network with a destination address 224/4 CIDR [CIDR] range.  The 
   network transports this packet to all receivers (replicated where 
   necessary) that have registered their interest in receiving these 
   packets. 
    
   [MCAST] describes the mapping of IPv4 Multicast Group addresses to 
   Ethernet MAC addresses, as follows: 
    
        An IP host group address is mapped to an Ethernet multicast 
        address by placing the low-order 23-bits of the IP address  
        into the low-order 23 bits of the Ethernet multicast address 
        01-00-5E-00-00-00 (hex).   Because there are 28 significant 
        bits in an IP host group address, more than one host group 
        address may map to the same Ethernet multicast address. 
    
   Multicast group addresses in the 224.0.0.0/24 range are used for 
   local subnetwork control.  This maps to the Ethernet multicast 
   address range 01-00-5E-00-00-XX, where XX is 00 through FF.  
   Ethernet frames within this range are always processed in the 
   control plane of many popular network devices, such as IGMP-snooping 
   switches. 
    
Group Address Restrictions 
 
   Because of the many-to-one mapping of IPv4 Multicast Group Addresses 
   to Ethernet MAC addresses, it is possible to overwhelm the control 
   plane of network devices by sending to group addresses that map into 
   the 01-00-5E-00-00-XX (hex) range. 
    
   The following IPv4 Multicast Group Address ranges MUST NOT be used 
   in order to avoid overwhelming the control plane of network devices:

IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA SHALL permanently reserve these IPv4 Multicast Group Address 
   ranges.  These group addresses MUST NOT be allocated for any IPv4 
   multicast application. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   Low to moderate multicast traffic levels, using addresses within 
   these IPv4 Multicast Group Address ranges, can result in severe 
   denial of service on network devices that process frames with 
   Ethernet MAC addresses in the 01-00-5E-00-00-XX (hex) range in the 
   control plane.
