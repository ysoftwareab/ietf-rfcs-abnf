Abstract 
    
   In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-req-01.txt, a set of requirements for a 
   protocol for localized mobility management has been described. In 
   this draft, we propose to include an additional requirement that 
   components of existing IETF protocols should be reused wherever 
   possible to avoid extensive standardization activity and to enable 
   reuse of existing IETF-compliant protocol implementations.

1.   ADDITIONAL NETLMM REQUIREMENT 
 
   In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-req-01.txt [2], a set of requirements 
   for a protocol for localized mobility management has been described. 
   We propose that the following requirement be added as an additional 
   requirement for the localized mobility management protocol. We also 
   propose that the gap analysis of existing global mobility management 
   protocols in Section 3 of [2] should take into consideration the 
   following requirement. 
    
   Use of IETF-standardized components (Requirement #10) 
    
   In many ways, the functionality expected of a protocol for local 
   mobility management is very similar to existing protocols that have 
   already been the subject of considerable work in IETF, such as, 
   Mobile IPv6 [3], Fast Mobile IPv6 [4], and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 
   [5]. While these protocols may not, in their entirety, satisfy the 
   requirements being laid out in [2], components of these protocols 
   and functional entities defined therein should be used wherever 
   applicable, to the extent possible, in order to avoid duplicating 
   the work that has already been done.  
    
    
   The requirement is that a local mobility management solution should 
   use protocols (or components of protocols) and functional elements

   that have already been defined in an IETF RFC to the extent 
   possible. Preference should be given to components of protocols that 
   are defined in IETF standards-track or internet standard RFCs.
