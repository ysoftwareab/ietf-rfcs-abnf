Abstract

   This document specifies how the usage of the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on top of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol (SCTPoDTLS) for transporting CLUE protocol
   messages between CLUE entities.

   The document describes the SCTP considerations for CLUE, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating a SCTPoDTLS connection for
   CLUE.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol are outside
   the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          February 2014


   CLUE data channel refers to the SCTPoDTLS connection that is
   established between two CLUE entities in order to transport CLUE
   messages.

   CLUE message refers to a CLUE protocol message that is sent over the
   CLUE data channel.

   CLUE entity refers to a SIP User Agent (UA) device that supports the
   CLUE mechanism (including the CLUE protocol).

3.  SCTPoDTLS

3.1.  General

   The CLUE data channel is implemented by using the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on top of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol [I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].

3.2.  SCTP Considerations

3.2.1.  SCTP Streams

   CLUE entities MUST establish two uni-directional STCP streams between
   themselves, one for CLUE messages sent in each direction.

3.2.2.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)

   CLUE entities MUST use a PPID value of 50 or 51, according to the
   procedures in [ref-to-rtcweb-data-channel].

3.2.3.  Reliability

   CLUE entities MUST use the reliable transport SCTP feature.

3.2.4.  Order

   CLUE entities MUST use the ordered delivery SCTP feature.

3.2.5.  SCTP Multihoming

   CLUE entities MUST NOT use SCTP multihoming.

   NOTE: The SCTPoDTLS mechanism does not support SCTP multihoming.
