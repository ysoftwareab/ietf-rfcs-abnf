INTERNET-DRAFT          Additional XMLDSIG URIs               April 2001


1. Introduction

   XML Digital Signatures have been standardized by the joint IETF/W3C
   XMLDSIG working group.  The Proposed Standard is specified in [RFC
   3075].  In addition, Canonical XML, which is used by many digital
   signatures, has been standardized by the W3C and is documented in
   Informational [RFC 3076].

   [RFC 3075] specifies URIs to identify algorithms.  However, this
   ppotocol is likely to be raised to Draft Standard soon, which
   requires two independent interoperable implementations to exist.
   This may require algorithms in which there appears to be substantial
   interest to be dropped.  This document is intended as a convenient
   reference list of URIs and descriptions for any dropped from the
   Proposed Standard due to lack of implementations plus additional
   suggested algorithms in which there appears to be substantial
   interest.



2. URIs

   The sections below parallel those in Section 6 of RFC 3075 which
   group various algorithms by there use in XML Digital Sigantures.



2.1 Message Digests



2.1.1 MD5

   Identifier:
         http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#md5

   The MD5 algorithm [RFC 1321] takes no explicit parameters. An example
   of an MD5 DigestAlgorithm element is:

         <DigestMethod Algorithm="http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#md5"/>

   An MD5 digest is a 128-bit string. The content of the DigestValue
   element shall be the base64 [RFC 2045] encoding of this bit string
   viewed as a 16-octet octet stream.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Additional XMLDSIG URIs               April 2001


2.1.2 SHA-256

   Identifier:
         http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#sha256

   The SHA-256 algorithm [SHA-256] takes no explicit parameters.  An
   example of a SHA-256 DigestAlgorithm element is:

         <DigestMethod Algorithm="http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#sha256/>

   A SHA-256 disgest is a 256 bit string.  The content of the
   DigestValue element shall be the base64 [RFC 2045] encoding of this
   string viewed as a 32-octet stream.



2.1.3 SHA-512

   Identifier:
         http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#sha512

   The SHA-512 algorithm [SHA-512] takes an optional truncation
   parameter, SHAtruncation, in the range 0 to 512.  An example of a
   SHA-512 DigestAlgorithm element with such a parameter is:

         <DigestMethod Algorith="http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#sha512">
            <SHAtruncation>400</SHAtruncation> </DigestMethod>

   A SHA-512 digest is a 512 bit string except that, if the
   SHA512truncation parameter is present specifying truncation to n
   bits, it is the left most n bits of that string.  In effect, the
   truncation parameter defaults to 512.

   Schema Definition:

   <simpleType name="SHAtruncation">
         <restriction base="integer"/> </simpleType>

   DTD:

   <!ELEMENT SHAtruncation (#PCDATA)>



2.1.4 SHA-384

   Identifier:
         http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#sha384

   The SHA-384 algorithm [SHA-384] takes an optional truncation

INTERNET-DRAFT          Additional XMLDSIG URIs               April 2001


   parameter, SHAtruncation, in the range 0 to 512.  An example of a
   SHA-384 DigestAlforithm element without such a parameter is:

         <DigestMethod Algorith="http://md.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#sha384"/>

   A SHA-384 digest is the leftmost 384 bits of the 512 bit string that
   the algorithm calculates internally except that, if the SHAtruncation
   parameter is present specifying truncation to n bits, it is the left
   most n bits of that string.  In effect, the truncation parameter
   defaults to 384. (The SHA-384 algorithm has the same internal
   structure as the SHA-512 algorithm but a few different constants are
   used, resulting in a different 512 bit hasj value, and it is normally
   truncated to 384 bits.

   See Schema Definition and DTD for SHA-512 above.



2.2 Message Authentication Codes

   Some text in this section is duplicated from RFC 3075 for the
   convenience of the reader.



2.2.1 HMAC-MD5

   Identifier:
         http://mac.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#hmac-md5

   The HMAC algorithm (RFC2104 [HMAC]) takes the truncation length in
   bits as a parameter; if the parameter is not specified then all the
   bits of the hash are output. An example of an HMAC SignatureMethod
   element:

   <SignatureMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-
   md5">
      <HMACOutputLength>112</HMACOutputLength>
   </SignatureMethod>

   The output of the HMAC algorithm is ultimately the output (possibly
   truncated) of the chosen digest algorithm. This value shall be base64
   encoded in the same straightforward fashion as the output of the
   digest algorithms. Example: the SignatureValue element for the HMAC-
   MD5 digest

         9294727A 3638BB1C 13F48EF8 158BFC9D

   from the test vectors in [RFC 2104] would be

INTERNET-DRAFT          Additional XMLDSIG URIs               April 2001


         <SignatureValue>kpRyejY4uxwT9I74FYv8nQ==</SignatureValue>

   Schema Definition:

   <simpleType name="HMACOutputLengthType">
         <restriction base="integer"/> </simpleType>

   DTD:

   <!ELEMENT HMACOutputLength (#PCDATA)>

   The Schema Definition and DTD immediately above are copied from RFC
   3075.

   Although some cryptographic suspicions have recently been cast on MD5
   for use in signatures such as RSA-MD5 below, this does not effect use
   of MD5 in HMAC.



2.2.2 HMAC-SHA-256

   Identifier:
         http://mac.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#hmac-sha256

   SHA-256 [SHA-256] can also be used in HMAC as described in section
   2.2.1 above.



2.2.3 HMAC-SHA-512

   Identifier:
         http://mac.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#hmac-sha512

   SHA-512 [SHA-512] can also be used in HMAC as describe in section
   2.2.1 above.



2.2.4 HMAC-SHA-384

   Identifier:
         http://mac.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#hmac-sha384

   SHA-384 [SHA-384] can also be used in HMAC as described in section
   2.2.1 above.

2.3 Signature Algorithms



2.3.1 RSA-MD5

   Identifier:
         http://sig.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#rsa-md5

   Due to increases in computer processor power and advances in
   cryptography, use of RSA-MD5 is not recommended.



2.3.2 RSA-SHA-256

   Identifier:
         http://sig.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#rsa-sha256



2.3.3 RSA-SHA-512

   Identifier:
         http://sig.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#rsa-sha512



2.3.4 RSA-SHA-384

   Identifier:
         http://sig.xmldsig.ietf.arpa#rsa-sha384



2.4 Canonicalizaton Algorithms



2.4.1 Minimal Canonicalization

   At this time there are not two independent interoperable
   implementations of Minimal Canonicalization.  Therefore, when XML
   Digital Siganture is advanced from Proposed Standard to Draft
   Standard, it must be dropped from the standard track documents.
   However, there is still substantial interest and indicates of
   possible future use for Minimal Canonicalization which can be found
   in [RFC 3075], Section 6.5.1.

   For reference, it's identifier is:
