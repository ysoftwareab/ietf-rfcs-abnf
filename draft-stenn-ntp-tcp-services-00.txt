                  Network Time Protocol: TCP Services
                    draft-stenn-ntp-tcp-services-00

Abstract

   NTP was assigned port number 123 in 1985, in RFC 960.  Traditionally,
   it has only used the UDP port as while UDP is useful for time
   synchronization, TCP is not suitable for time synchronization.  UDP
   packet have length limits, and there are rate limits imposed by the
   protocol specification.  Between the UDP packet length and rate
   limits, some other mechanism must be provided for efficient exchange
   of larger data packets.  A TCP connection can be used for these uses.
   Additionally, we can perform better authentication and authorization
   checks using a TCP connection.

1.  Introduction

   NTP was assigned port number 123 in 1985, in RFC 960.  The NTP
   protocol only uses UDP for its work, and UDP is an appropriate
   protocol for time synchronization.  However, there are other needs
   for NTP, including monitoring and control, and ephemeral key
   exchange.

   For some of these cases, a TCP connection is much better.

   This specification describes a high-level framework for providing TCP
   services for NTP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  NTP TCP Services

   To provide NTP TCP Services, an NTP instance establishes
   communications with a TCP Listener.  This could be a separate process
   or it could be part of the NTP daemon.  Support STARTTLS.  RFC 5705
   [RFC5705] RFC 7301 [RFC7301]

3.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
