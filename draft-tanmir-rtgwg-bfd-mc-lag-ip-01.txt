1.  Introduction

   The [RFC7130] defines use of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interfaces.  Multi-chassis LAG (MC-
   LAG) is type of LAG [IEEE.802.1AX.2008] with member links terminated
   on separate chassis.  [IEEE.802.1AX.2008] does not specify MC-LAG but
   doesn't preclude it either.  Link Aggregation Control Protocol
   (LACP), also defined in [IEEE.802.1AX.2008], can work with MC-LAG
   but, as in LAG case, can detect link failure only in range of single
   seconds.  This document defines how mechanism defined to work on LAG
   interfaces [RFC7130] can be adapted to MC-LAG case to enable sub-
   second detection of member link failure.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

1.1.1.  Terminology

   BFD: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

   LAG: Link Aggregation Group

   LACP: Link Aggregation Control Protocol

   MC-LAG: Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Problem Statement

   [RFC7130] does not specify selection of the destination IP address
   for the BFD control packet.  The only requirement related to the
   selection is in Section 2.1 stating that the use of address family
   across all member links of the given LAG MUST be consistent across
   all the links.  Thus it is implied that the same unicast IP address
   will be used on all member links of the LAG as use of different
   destination addresses would defeat the purpose of [RFC7130]
   transforming the case into set of single-hop BFD sessions [RFC5881].
   But single unicast IP address may not work in MC-LAG case as the
   member links are terminated on the separate chassis.  This document
   proposes how to overcome this problem if using IP or Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) data plane encapsulation.

3.  BFD on MC-LAG with IP only data plane

   As described in [RFC7130] micro-BFD session on the LAG interfaces may
   use either IPv4 or IPv6 address family.  In some cases two sessions,
   one with IPv4 and one with IPv6 addresses, may run concurrently.
   This document doesn't change any of these but specifies selection of
   the destination IP address in MC-LAG use case:

   o  if IPv4 address family being used for micro-BFD session, then the
      link-local multicast address 224.0.0.0/24 SHOULD be used as the
      destination IP address.  Subnet broadcast address MAY be used as
      the destination IP address as well;

   o  if the address family used is IPv6, then the IPv6 link-local
      multicast address FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2 MUST be used as the
      destination IP address.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA allocations.  This section
   may be deleted by RFC Editor.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC7130] apply to this
   document.
