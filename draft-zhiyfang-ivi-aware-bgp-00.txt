Internet-Draft        IVI xlate rules aware in BGP              July 2010

1.  Introduction

  This section explains the reasoning for BGP-4[RFC4271] aware IVI xlate
  rulesimplementation.

1.1.  Motivation

  The experiences for the IPv6 deployment in the past 10 years strongly
  indicate to communicate with IPv4 and IPv6 address families, Since IVI
  use Stateless mapping,  but currently IVI proposal is send Ipv4 and
  Ipv6 route update independency to different routing domain like below:

      <------IPv4 update----(IVI-Router)----IPv6 update ------->
         (192.168.1.0/24)                  (2001:ABCD::/64)

            Figure 1: Independent Routing info update in each domain

  Address Mapping rules are offered by DNS64 services which will cause
  some interworking issue.

  But it is also important to announce the IVI based Static mapping
  rules to other internet router to build up a global based
  v4/v6 xlate RIB.

1.2.  Potential Benefits

  With the IVI xlate rules aware in MP-BGP4, it will provide many
  benefits.

1.2.1 Easy for dIVI support

  There are two potential deployment scenario for dIVI:

   +-+    IPv4    +--+   IPv6 Transit Core    +--+    IPv4    +-+
   |S|-->--//-->--|R1|=====>=====//=====>=====|R2|-->--//-->--|D|
   +-+            +--+                        +--+            +-+
             (IVI 1:1 xlate)               (IVI 1:1 xlate)


   +-+    IPv6    +--+   IPv4 Transit Core    +--+    IPv6    +-+
   |S|-->--//-->--|R1|=====>=====//=====>=====|R3|-->--//-->--|D|
   +-+            +--+                        +--+            +-+
             (IVI 1:1 xlate)               (IVI 1:1 xlate)

              Figure 2: dIVI for 4over6 and 6over4 tunnel

  The router on remote side if aware the local router's IVI xlate rules,
  both router will aware the IVI services are available , Then it will
  trigger both router running under Double IVI mode without any 6to4
  ALG(Application Layer Gateway to check address translate deep in packet
  payload) function to save the resource.

Internet-Draft        IVI xlate rules aware in BGP              July 2010

1.2.2 dIVI build up full mesh tunnel

  dIVI will not use any ALG function since aware the remote router's
  serviceability , it's a high performance solution to migrate the 6over4
  and 4over6 tunnel services to unified IVI services.With BGP
  announcement,IVI service info can be aware in all internet BGP speakers,
  and all routers can easily build up full meshed dIVI based "tunnel".

1.2.3 IVI service aware for Intra-domain routing

  With iBGP propagation all intra-domain router can be aware for IVI
  service, and Service Provider can setup a IVI service-router farm to
  handle all v4/v6 xlate service.IVI service can be easily centralized
  or distribute deploy in SP routing domain.

1.2.4 Easy for fallback to single IVI

  When remote router withdraw the IVI xlate rules advertisement in BGP-4.
  Local BGP Speaker still can trigger IVI xlate service by using single
  IVI and involve ALG function together.

2.  Definition & implementation

2.1 MP-BGP Signaling flow Without IVI aware

   +-+    IPv4    +--+   IPv6 Transit Core      +--+    IPv4    +-+
   |S|-->--//-->--|R1|=====>=====/R2/=====>=====|R3|-->--//-->--|D|
   +-+            +--+                          +--+            +-+
                 IVI 1:1 xlate                   IVI xlate

  <--10.1.0.0/24---BGPd---------2001:ABCD:ABCD::/40------>

   [Note: R1 xlate rule: 10.1.0.0/24<-- --> 2001:ABCD:ABCD::/40]

        Figure 3: IVI deployment without BGP IVI xlate rules propagation

  Previously IVI draft use independent RIB update. R1 will only send IPv6
  SAFI to R2. and downstream router will lost xlate-rules from upstream
  router. Then both R1 and R3 will trigger ALG function to handle the
  4<-->6 translation.

2.2 MP-BGP Signaling flow With IVI aware

  With MP-BGP protocol extensions to support IVI , Router can be aware
  The remote IVI mapping rules, There are two potential implementation
  to support IVI service aware in BGP domain.

  Option-1: Carrier IVI xlate rules in an optional transitive attribute
  Option-2: Develop a new SAFI for IVI service

Internet-Draft        IVI xlate rules aware in BGP              July 2010

2.2.1 Option-1: Carrier IVI info in new attribute
2.2.1.1 Attribute definition
  A new optional transitive attribute introduced to store the IVI xlate
  information. Definition as follows:

        Attribute-name :  IVI_XLATE
        Attribute-TypeCode: 27 (if IANA approved)
        Attribute-Category: Optional transitive
        Path Segment Type:
           1- carrier IPv6 prefix and propagation in IPv4 domain
           2- carrier IPv4 prefix and propagation in IPv6 domain
           3- Origin Router with IPv4 format
           4- Origin Router with IPv6 format

2.2.1.2 Update in IPv4 Domain

  When IVI router send update message to IPv4 AFI, it will add a new
  optional transitive attribute (IVI_XLATE) include the IPv6 prefix in IVI
  xlate rules. It will notice all the other IPv4 BGP routers to use R1 as
  remote handle IVI translator. This would be let IPv4 domain aware single
  IVI services and trigger single IVI on R1. Signaling flow describe in
  Figure 4:

  +-+    IPv4           +--+     IPv6        +--+         +-+
  |S|-->--//----->------|R1|=====//=========>|R3|--//-->--|D|
  +-+                   +--+                 +--+         +-+

    |     OriginRouter: R1's IPv4 address       |
    
                 Figure 4: Update in IPv4 Domain

2.2.1.3 Update in IPv6 Domain

  Same as update in IPv4 domain, IVI router will also carrier IPv4 subnet
  info in an optional transitive attribute, Signaling flow describe in
  Figure 5

                              |     OriginRouter: R1's IPv6 address      |

Internet-Draft        IVI xlate rules aware in BGP              July 2010

2.2.2 Option-2: Introduce a new IVI SAFI

  When BGP speaker try to send out MP_REACH_NLRI update to remote router
  with new SAFI, the format of these update is should be followed in this
  section.

2.2.2.1 SAFI definition

  The AFI and SAFI assignment for IVI xlate rules will be used ( if IANA
  approved) like below:
     * AFI = 2(IPv6)
     * SAFI = 70(IVI xlate rules)

2.2.2.2 NLRI Encapsulation

  Base on IVI address format, IPv4 and IPv6 prefix for xlate rule can be
  store in a 128bit field. NLRI encapsulation defined as follows:

  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+
  | IPv6 Prefix                                |  IPv4 Prefix    |
  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+
  0                                            96                128

                  Figure 6: NLRI encapsulation

2.2.2.3 NEXT-HOP

  Next-hop attribute calculate algorithm still follow the [RFC4271] in
  Section 5.1.3.

2.2.2.4 IVI SAFI Signaling flow

  With new SAFI, detailed signaling flow defined as follows:


  +-+    IPv4           +--+     IPv6        +--+         +-+
  |S|-->--//----->------|R1|=====//=========>|R3|--//-->--|D|

                  Figure 7: SAFI based IVI update

2.3 Implementation analysis

  Option-2 introduce a new SAFI, and it will request all the transit Router
  in the forwarding path to upgrade the BGP software to be IVI aware Router.
  Option-1 use "Optional transitive attribute" that no need require router
  upgrade the BGP software.

  Option-1 MUST support for IVI service aware in BGP, Option-2 is an
  alternative option for IVI service aware in BGP.

3.  Route decision

3.1 Process UPDATE

  When update message include "IVI_XLATE" attribute, it will copy the NLRI
  prefix with the prefix in IVI_XLATE attribute together in IVI xlate RIB,
  and also copy "IVI_XLATE origin router" value as next_hop. All the other
  Path attribute will also copy to IVI xlate RIB.

  If Router implement with Option-2 IVI SAFI, it will follow the general
  work flow which defined in [RFC4271].

3.2 Best route lookup

  During the route decision, best routes lookup prefer the original
  AFI/SAFI RIB. If the router does not enable IVI xlate service, the
  packets MUST be dropped and not ALLOW to trigger IVI xlate RIB lookup.
  If the original RIB does not have available next-hop, it will trigger
  IVI xlate RIB lookup.

  IVI xlate RIB route decision will also based on "Path Attribute" and
  follow the RFC4271.

3.3 Route advertisement

  If local Router defined IVI xlate service, it will trigger the local
  xlate rules add into IVI xlate RIB.

Internet-Draft        IVI xlate rules aware in BGP              July 2010

  All best route in IVI xlate RIB will advertise to the other Speakers,
  it will automatic add as "IVI_XLATE" attribute during update the IPv4
  and IPv6 SAFI, detailed signaling flow defined in Section 2.2.1.

4.  Packet flow

4.1 IPv4 packet received

4.1.1 IPv4 RIB has available route

  When an IPv4 packet received, if it has available route in IPv4 RIB,
  the detailed forwarding procedure describe as bellow:

4.1.2 IPv4 RIB check failure and IVI not enable

  When an IPv4 packet received, and IPv4 RIB check failure, if IVI not
  enable on local router , packets will dropped .

4.1.3 IPv4 RIB check failure and IVI enable

  When an IPv4 packet received, and IPv4 RIB check failure, if IVI
  enabled, it will trigger IVI xlate RIB lookup.

  When received packet's destination address is in local xlate prefix,
  it will trigger the source address lookup in IVI xlate RIB. If source
  address also can be found in IVI xlate RIB, it will trigger dIVI
  process without ALG function involved, detailed implementation defined
  in Section 4.3. If source address not in xlate RIB , it will trigger
  normal ALG involved IVI translation.

               } else {
                      ALG_invovle == ON
               }
           Step.4  ------ IVI xlate --------->

  enable on local router , packets will dropped .

4.2.3 IPv6 RIB check failure and IVI enable

  When an IPv6 packet received, and IPv6 RIB check failure, if IVI enabled,
  it will trigger IVI xlate RIB lookup.

  When received packet's destination address is in local xlate prefix,
  it will trigger the source address lookup in IVI xlate RIB. If source
  address also can be found in IVI xlate RIB, it will trigger dIVI process
  without ALG function involved, detailed implementation defined in
  Section 4.3. If source address not in xlate RIB , it will trigger normal
  ALG involved IVI translation.

4.3 Double IVI

  If local router and remote router generate the IVI xlate rules on both
  side and also be propagation in BGP domain. It's easy for local router
  aware and trigger dIVI function without ALG involved.  2 scenario for
  dIVI usage which defined in Figure 2. This is an alternative way to
  migrate 6over4 and 4over6 tunnel to IVI framework.

4.3.1 Benefit for dIVI migrate softwire

  With [RFC5747] and 6over4 softwire implementation, propagation tunnel
  info in BGP domain need all router upgrade to aware the new SAFI. But
  with IVI aware in BGP, it's easy to remain the transit router stay on
  old BGP software. dIVI also has same auto full mesh capability with the
  BGP advertisement.

4.3.2 Backward capability

  Another potential benefit is dIVI solution support backward capability
  to single IVI, but when one router fallback to none-support version,
  the softwire tunnel will shutdown.

5. IPv4 to IPv6 migration

  With IVI aware BGP support, the ipv4 to ipv6 migration procedure defined
  like below:
    
  Step.1 : Migrate current tunnel based services to dIVI to setup unified
  IVI framework.
                   +----- dIVI based Tunnel-----+
                   |                            |
   +-+    IPv4    +--+   IPv6 Transit Core    +--+    IPv4    +-+
   |S|-->--//-->--|R1|=====>=====//=====>=====|R2|-->--//-->--|D|
   +-+            +--+                        +--+            +-+
             (IVI 1:1 xlate)               (IVI 1:1 xlate)

                      Figure 10: dIVI based tunnel
    
  Step.2 : IPv4 network connect to IPv6 island use single IVI

  +-+    IPv4           +-----------+     IPv6      +--+         +-+
  |S|-->--//----->------|R1(1:1 IVI)|=====//=======>|R3|--//-->--|D|
  +-+                   +-----------+               +--+         +-+

                      Figure 11: singe IVI
    
  Step.3 : Upgrade AS internal network to IPv6, and withdraw relative
  prefix advertisement in IVI xlate rules. Since IVI backward capability
  descripts in Section 4.3.2, Withdraw the IVI xlate rules will not break
  the traffic forwarding.

        Withdraw IVI xlate rules          (Remain IVI 1:1 xlate)


          Figure 12: upgrade AS internal link and withdraw IVI xlate rules

  Step.4 : Upgrade all link to IPv6 remote and disable all IVI service.


6. Security Considerations

  With IVI aware xlate in BGP, the basic forwarding and route decision
  mechanism still follow the general MP-BGP procedure. BGP peering may
  be maintained over IPsec or SSL or other secure communications.

7. IANA Considerations

  This document defines a new BGP Attribute like below:

      Attribute-name :  IVI_XLATE
      Attribute-TypeCode: 27
      Attribute-Category: Optional transitive
      Defination:           See Section 2.2.1.1

  With Option-2 IVI SAFI implementation it required new SAFI definition
  like below:

       * AFI = 2(IPv6)
       * SAFI = 70(IVI xlate rules)

   Detailed definition See Section 2.2.2.1
