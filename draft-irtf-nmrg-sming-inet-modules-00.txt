Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as
   Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents
   at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

Abstract

   This memo defines SMIng [1] modules for commonly used Internet
   network layer addressing information. The intent is that these
   definitions will be imported and used in other SMIng modules that
   would otherwise define their own representations. 

   This document builds on RFC 2851 [3] and extends it in many ways.

3. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of SMIng types and classes which may be used by other
   SMIng modules to define management objects. 

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the
   modules that define management objects.
