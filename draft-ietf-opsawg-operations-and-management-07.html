<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due
      consideration of functionality needed to operate and manage the
      protocols. Retrofitting operations and management is sub-optimal. The
      purpose of this document is to provide guidance to authors and reviewers
      of documents defining new protocols or protocol extensions, about covering
      aspects of operations and management that should be considered.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Often when new protocols or protocol extensions are developed, not
      enough consideration is given to how the protocol will be deployed,
      operated and managed. Retrofitting operations and management mechanisms
      is often hard and architecturally unpleasant, and certain protocol
      design choices may make deployment, operations, and management
      particularly hard. Since the ease of operations and management may
      impact the success of IETF protocols, this document provides guidelines
      to help protocol designers and working groups consider the operations
      and management functionality needed by their new IETF protocol or
      protocol extension at an earlier phase.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Designing for Operations and Management</h3>

<p>The operational environment and manageability of the protocol should be considered from
      the start when new protocols are designed.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should consider which operations and management needs are 
      relevant to their protocol, document how those needs could be addressed, and suggest standard management protocols and data models that could be used to address those needs. This is similar to a working group (WG) that considers which security
      threats are relevant to their protocol, documents how threats should be mitigated, 
      and then suggests appropriate standard protocols that could mitigate the threats.
</p>
<p>When a WG considers operation and management functionality for a
      protocol, the document should contain enough information to understand
      how the protocol will be deployed and managed, but the WG should expect
      that considerations for operations and management may need to be updated
      in the future, after further operational experience has been gained.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
This Document</h3>

<p>This document makes a distinction between "Operational
  Considerations" and "Management Considerations", although the two are closely related. The section on manageability is focused on management technology such as how to utilize management protocols and how to design management data models. The operational considerations apply to operating the protocol within a network, even if there were no management protocol actively being used.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance about what to
      consider when thinking about the management and deployment of a new
      protocol, and to provide guidance about documenting the considerations.
      The following guidelines are designed to help writers provide a
      reasonably consistent format for such documentation. Separate
      manageability and operational considerations sections are desirable in
      many cases, but their structure and location is a decision that can be
      made from case to case.
</p>
<p>This document does not impose a solution, or imply that a 
      formal data model is needed, or imply that using a specific management protocol 
      is mandatory. If protocol designers
      conclude that the technology can be managed solely by using proprietary
      command line interfaces (CLIs), and no structured or standardized data model needs to be in place,
      this might be fine, but it is a decision that should be explicit in a
      manageability discussion, that this is how the protocol will need to be
      operated and managed. Protocol designers should avoid having
      manageability pushed for a later phase of the development of the
      standard.
</p>
<p>Any decision to make a Management Considerations section a mandatory publication
      requirement for IETF documents is the responsibility of the IESG, or
      specific area directors, or working groups, and this document avoids
      recommending any mandatory publication requirements. For a complex
      protocol, a completely separate draft on operations and management might
      be appropriate, or even a completely separate WG effort.
</p>
<p>This document discusses the importance of considering operations and
      management by setting forth a list of guidelines and a checklist
      of questions to consider, which a protocol designer or reviewer can use to evaluate whether
      the protocol and documentation address common operations and
      management needs. Operations and management are highly dependent on their
      environment, so most guidelines are subjective rather than objective.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Motivation</h3>

<p>For years the IETF community has used the IETF Standard
        Management Framework, including the Simple Network Management Protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC3410'>[RFC3410]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Case, J., Mundy, R., Partain, D., and B. Stewart, &ldquo;Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>,  the Structure of Management Informatiion <a class='info' href='#RFC2578'>[RFC2578]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McCloghrie, K., Ed., Perkins, D., Ed., and J. Schoenwaelder, Ed., &ldquo;Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2),&rdquo; April&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>, and MIB data models for managing new protocols. As the Internet has evolved, operators have found the reliance on one protocol and one schema language for managing all aspects of the Internet inadequate. The IESG policy to require working groups to write a MIB module to provide manageability for new protocols is being replaced by a policy that is more open to using a variety of management protocols and data models designed to achieve different goals.
</p>
<p>This document provides some initial guidelines for considering operations and management in an IETF Management Framework that consists of multiple protocols
        and multiple data modeling languages, with an eye toward being flexible while also 
        striving for interoperability.

<a name="rfc.section.1.4"></a><h3>1.4.&nbsp;
Background</h3>

<p>There have been a significant number of efforts, meetings, and  documents that are related to Internet operations and management. Some of them are mentioned here, to help protocol designers find documentation of previous efforts. Hopefully, providing these references will help the IETF avoid rehashing old discussions and reinventing old solutions.
</p>
<p>In 1988, the IAB published <a class='info' href='#RFC1052'>IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management Standards<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cerf, V., &ldquo;IAB recommendations for the development of Internet network management standards,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1052] which recommended a solution that, where possible, deliberately separates modeling languages, data models, and the protocols that carry data. The goal is to allow standardized information and data models to be used by different protocols.
</p>
<p>In 2001, OPS Area design teams were created to document
        requirements related to configuration of IP-based networks. One output
        was "Requirements for Configuration Management of IP-based Networks"
        <a class='info' href='#RFC3139'>[RFC3139]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sanchez, L., McCloghrie, K., and J. Saperia, &ldquo;Requirements for Configuration Management of IP-based Networks,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In 2003, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop on
        Network Management <a class='info' href='#RFC3535'>[RFC3535]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schoenwaelder, J., &ldquo;Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management Workshop,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> that discussed the
        strengths and weaknesses of some IETF network management protocols,
        and compared them to operational needs, especially configuration.
</p>
<p>One issue discussed was the user-unfriendliness of the binary
        format of SNMP and <a class='info' href='#RFC3084'>COPS Usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chan, K., Seligson, J., Durham, D., Gai, S., McCloghrie, K., Herzog, S., Reichmeyer, F., Yavatkar, R., and A.

        recommended that the IETF explore an XML-based Structure of Management
        Information, and an XML-based protocol for configuration.
</p>
<p>Another conclusion was that the tools for event/alarm
        correlation and for root cause analysis and logging are not sufficient, and
        that there is a need to support a human interface and a programmatic
        interface. The IETF decided to standardize aspects of the de facto
        standard for system logging security and programmatic support.
</p>
<p>In 2006, the IETF discussed whether the Management Framework should
        be updated to accommodate multiple IETF schema languages for describing the structure of management information, and multiple IETF standard protocols for doing network management.

Operational Considerations - How Will the New Protocol Fit Into the Current Environment?</h3>

<p>Designers of a new protocol should carefully consider the operational
      aspects. To ensure that a protocol will be practical to deploy in the
   real world, it is not enough to merely define it very precisely in a
   well-written document. Operational aspects will have a serious impact on the actual
      success of a protocol. Such aspects include bad interactions with
      existing solutions, a difficult upgrade path, difficulty of debugging
      problems, difficulty configuring from a central database, or a
      complicated state diagram that operations staff will find difficult to
      understand.
</p>
<p>BGP flap damping <a class='info' href='#RFC2439'>[RFC2439]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Villamizar, C., Chandra, R., and R. Govindan, &ldquo;BGP Route Flap Damping,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> is an example. It was
      designed to block high frequency route flaps, however the design did not
      consider the existence of BGP path exploration/slow convergence. In real
      operations, path exploration caused false flap damping, resulting in
  loss of reachability. As a result, many networks
      turned flap damping off.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Operations Model</h3>

<p>Protocol designers can analyze the operational environment and mode
        of work in which the new protocol or extension will work. Such an
        exercise need not be reflected directly by text in their document,
        but could help in visualizing the operational model related to the
        applicability of the protocol in the Internet environments where it
        will be deployed. 
</p>
<p>A key question is how the protocol can operate "out of the box".
        If implementers are free to select their own defaults, the protocol 
        needs to operate well with any choice of values. If there are 
        sensible defaults, these need to be stated.
</p>
<p>There may be a need to support a human interface, e.g., for
        troubleshooting, and a programmatic interface, e.g., for automated
        monitoring and root cause analysis. The application programming
        interfaces and the human interfaces might benefit from being similar to ensure that
        the information exposed by these two interfaces is consistent when presented
        to an operator. Identifying consistent methods of determining information, such as
        what gets counted in a specific counter, is relevant.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should consider what management operations are
        expected to be performed as a result of the deployment of the protocol
        - such as whether write operations will be allowed on routers and on
        hosts, or whether notifications for alarms or other events will be
        expected.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Installation and Initial Setup</h3>

<p>Anything that can be configured can be misconfigured.  "Architectural Principles of the Internet" <a class='info' href='#RFC1958'>[RFC1958]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B., &ldquo;Architectural Principles of the Internet,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> Section 3.8 states: "Avoid
   options and parameters whenever possible.  Any options and parameters
   should be configured or negotiated dynamically rather than manually."
</p>
<p>To simplify configuration, protocol designers should consider specifying
  reasonable defaults, including default modes and 
        parameters. For example, it could be helpful or necessary to specify
        default values for modes, timers, default state of logical control
        variables, default transports, and so on. Even if default values are
        used, it must be possible to retrieve all the actual values or at
        least an indication that known default values are being used.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should consider how to enable operators to
        concentrate on the configuration of the network as a whole rather than
        on individual devices. Of course, how one accomplishes this is the hard part.
</p>
<p>It is desirable to discuss the background of chosen default
        values, or perhaps why a range of values makes sense. In many cases,
        as technology changes, the values in an RFC might make less and less
        sense. It is very
        useful to understand whether defaults are based on best current
        practice and are expected to change as technologies advance or whether
        they have a more universal value that should not be changed
        lightly. For example, the default interface speed might be expected to change over time due to increased speeds in the network, and cryptographical algorithms might be expected to change over time as older algorithms are "broken". 

</p>
<p>it is extremely important to set a sensible default value for
            all parameters
</p>
<p>The default value should stay on the conservative side rather
            than on the "optimizing performance" side. (example: the initial
            RTT and RTTvar values of a TCP connection)
</p>
<p>For those parameters that are speed-dependent, instead of using
            a constant, try to set the default value as a function of the link
            speed or some other relevant factors. This would help reduce the
            chance of problems caused by technology advancement.

Migration Path</h3>

<p>If the new protocol is a new version of an existing one, or if it is
        replacing another technology, the protocol designer should consider
        how deployments should transition to the new protocol. This should
        include co-existence with previously deployed protocols and/or
        previous versions of the same protocol, incompatibilities between
        versions, translation between versions, and side-effects that might
        occur. Are older protocols or versions disabled or do they co-exist in
        the network with the new protocol?
</p>
<p>Many protocols benefit from being incrementally deployable - operators may deploy aspects of a protocol before deploying the protocol fully.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components</h3>

<p>Protocol designers should consider the requirements that the new
        protocol might put on other protocols and functional components, and
        should also document the requirements from other protocols and functional elements that have
        been considered in designing the new protocol.
</p>
<p>These considerations should generally remain illustrative to avoid
        creating restrictions or dependencies, or potentially impacting the
        behavior of existing protocols, or restricting the extensibility of
        other protocols, or assuming other protocols will not be extended in
        certain ways. If restrictions or dependencies exist, they should be stated.
</p>
<p>For example, the design of <a class='info' href='#RFC2205'>Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Zhang, L., Berson, S., Herzog, S., and S. Jamin, &ldquo;Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2205] 
        required each router to look at the RSVP PATH message, and if the router
        understood RSVP, to add its own address to the message to
        enable automatically tunneling through non-RSVP routers. But in reality
        routers cannot look at an otherwise normal IP packet, and potentially
        take it off the fast path! The initial designers overlooked that a new
        "deep packet inspection" requirement was being put on the functional components of a router.
        The "router alert" option was finally developed to solve this problem
        for RSVP and other protocols that require the router to take some packets
        off the fast forwarding path. Router alert has its own problems in impacting router performance.

<a name="rfc.section.2.5"></a><h3>2.5.&nbsp;
Impact on Network Operation</h3>

<p>The introduction of a new protocol or extensions to an existing
        protocol may have an impact on the operation of existing networks.
        Protocol designers should outline such impacts (which may be positive)
        including scaling concerns and interactions with other protocols. For
        example, a new protocol that doubles the number of active, reachable
        addresses in use within a network might need to be considered in the
        light of the impact on the scalability of the interior gateway protocols operating within
        the network.
</p>
<p>A protocol could send active monitoring packets on the wire. If we don't pay attention, we might get very good accuracy, but could send too many active monitoring packets.
</p>
<p>The protocol designer should consider the potential impact on the
        behavior of other protocols in the network and on the traffic levels
        and traffic patterns that might change, including specific types of
        traffic such as multicast. Also consider the need to install new
        components that are added to the network as result of the changes in
        the operational model, such as servers performing auto-configuration
        operations.
</p>
<p>The protocol designer should consider also the impact on
        infrastructure applications like <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>DNS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1034], the registries, or the size of routing
        tables. For example, <a class='info' href='#RFC5321'>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Klensin, J., &ldquo;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5321] servers use a
        reverse DNS lookup to filter out incoming connection requests. When
        Berkeley installed a new spam filter, their mail server stopped
        functioning because of the DNS cache resolver overload.
</p>
<p>The impact on performance may also be noted - increased delay or
        jitter in real-time traffic applications, or response time in
        client-server applications when encryption or filtering are
        applied.
</p>
<p>It is important to minimize the impact caused by configuration
        changes. Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be
        possible to generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with
        minimal state changes and effects on network and systems.

Verifying Correct Operation</h3>

<p>The protocol designer should consider techniques for testing the
        effect that the protocol has had on the network by sending data
        through the network and observing its behavior (aka active monitoring). Protocol designers
        should consider how the correct end-to-end operation of the new
        protocol in the network can be tested actively and passively, and how the correct data or
        forwarding plane function of each network element can be verified to
        be working properly with the new protocol. Which metrics are of interest? 
</p>
<p>Having simple protocol status and health indicators on network devices is a 
        recommended means to check correct operation.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Management Considerations - How Will The Protocol be Managed?</h3>

<p>The considerations of manageability should start from describing the
      operations model, which includes identifying the entities to be
      managed, how the managed protocol is supposed to be installed,
      configured and monitored. 
</p>
<p>Considerations for management should include a discussion of what
      needs to be managed, and how to achieve various management tasks. Where are the managers and what type of management interfaces and protocols will they need? The
      "write a MIB module" approach to considering management often focuses on
      monitoring a protocol endpoint on a single device. A MIB module document
      typically only considers monitoring properties observable at one end,
      while the document does not really cover managing the *protocol* (the
      coordination of multiple ends), and does not even come near managing the
      *service* (which includes a lot of stuff that is very far away from the
      box). This is exactly what operators hate - you need to be able to
      manage both ends. As <a class='info' href='#RFC3535'>[RFC3535]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schoenwaelder, J., &ldquo;Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management Workshop,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> says, MIB modules
      can often be characterized as a list of ingredients without a
      recipe.
</p>
<p>The management model should take into account
        factors such as: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>what type of management entities will be involved (agents,
            network management systems)?
</li>
<li>what is the possible architecture (client-server,
            manager-agent, poll-driven or event-driven, autoconfiguration,
            two levels or hierarchical)?
</li>
<li>what are the management operations - initial
            configuration, dynamic configuration, alarm and exception
            reporting, logging, performance monitoring, performance reporting,
            debugging?
</li>
<li>how are these operations performed - locally, remotely, atomic
            operation, scripts? Are they performed immediately or time scheduled or event triggered?
</li>
</ul>

<p>Protocol designers should consider how the new protocol will be
        managed in different deployment scales. It might be sensible to use a
        local management interface to manage the new protocol on a single
        device, but in a large network, remote management using a centralized
        server and/or using distributed management functionality might make
        more sense. Auto-configuration and default parameters might be
        possible for some new protocols.
</p>
<p>Management needs to be considered not only from the perspective of a device, but also from the perspective of network and service management perspectives. A service might be network and operational functionality derived from the implementation and deployment of a new protocol. Often an individual network element is not aware of the service being delivered.
</p>
<p>WGs should consider how to configure multiple related/co-operating
      devices and how to back off if one of those configurations fails or
      causes trouble. NETCONF <a class='info' href='#RFC4741'>[RFC4741]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Enns, R., &ldquo;NETCONF Configuration Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> addresses this in a generic manner by allowing
      an operator to lock the configuration on multiple devices, perform the
      configuration settings/changes, check that they are OK (undo if not) and
      then unlock the devices.
</p>
<p>Techniques for debugging protocol interactions in a network must be
      part of the network management discussion. Implementation source code
      should be debugged before ever being added to a network, so asserts and
      memory dumps do not normally belong in management data models. However,
      debugging on-the-wire interactions is a protocol issue: while the messages can 
      be seen by sniffing, it is enormously helpful if a protocol specification supports 
      features that make debugging of network interactions and behaviors easier. 
      There could be alerts issued when messages are received, or when there are 
      state transitions in the protocol state machine. However, the state machine is 
      often not part of the on-the-wire protocol; the state machine explains how the
protocol works so that an implementer can decide, in an implementation-specific
manner, how to react to a received event.

</p>
<p>In a client/server protocol, it may be more important to instrument
      the server end of a protocol than the client end, since the performance of the
      server might impact more nodes than the performance of a specific client.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Interoperability</h3>

<p>Just as when deploying protocols that will inter-connect devices,
        our primary goal in considering management should be interoperability,
        whether across devices from different vendors, across models from the
        same vendor, or across different releases of the same product. Management 
        interoperability refers to allowing information sharing and operations between 
        multiple devices and multiple management applications, often from different vendors. 
        Interoperability allows for the use of 3rd party applications and the outsourcing of 
        management services.

</p>
<p>Some product designers and protocol designers assume that if a
        device can be managed individually using a command line interface or a
        web page interface, that such a solution is enough. But when equipment
        from multiple vendors is combined into a large network, scalability of
        management becomes a problem. It is important to have consistency in
        the management interfaces so network-wide operational processes can be
        automated. For example, a single switch might be easily managed using
        an interactive web interface when installed in a single office small
        business, but when, say, a fast food company installs similar switches
        from multiple vendors in hundreds or thousands of individual branches
        and wants to automate monitoring them from a central location,
        monitoring vendor-and-model-specific web pages would be difficult to
        automate.
</p>
<p>Getting everybody to agree on a single syntax and an associated protocol
        to do all management has proven to be difficult. So management systems
        tend to speak whatever the boxes support, whether the IETF likes this
        or not. The IETF is moving from support for one schema language for modeling 
        the structure of management information  (<a class='info' href='#RFC2578'>Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)<span> (</span><span class='info'>McCloghrie, K., Ed., Perkins, D., Ed., and J. Schoenwaelder, Ed., &ldquo;Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2),&rdquo; April&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2578]) 
        and one simple network
        management protocol (<a class='info' href='#RFC3410'>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Case, J., Mundy, R., Partain, D., and B. Stewart, &ldquo;Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3410]) towards
        support for additional schema languages and additional management protocols suited to
        different purposes.   Other Standard
        Development Organizations (e.g. DMTF, TMF) also define schemas and protocols for management
         and these  may be more suitable than IETF
        schemas and protocols in some cases. Some of the alternatives being considered include

</p>
<p>Interoperability needs to be considered on the syntactic level and
        the semantic level. While it can be irritating and time-consuming,
        application designers including operators who write their own scripts
        can make their processing conditional to accommodate syntactic differences
        across vendors or models or releases of product.
</p>
<p>Semantic differences are much harder to deal with on the manager
        side - once you have the data, its meaning is a function of the
        managed entity. For example, if a single counter provided by vendor A
        counts three types of error conditions, while the corresponding
        counter provided by vendor B counts seven types of error conditions,
        these counters cannot be compared effectively - they are not
        interoperable counters.
</p>
<p>Information models are helpful to try to focus interoperability on
        the semantic level - they establish standards for what information
        should be gathered, and how gathered information might be used
        regardless of which management interface carries the data or which
        vendor produces the product. The use of an information model might
        help improve the ability of operators to correlate messages in
        different protocols where the data overlaps, such as a SYSLOG message
        and an SNMP notification about the same event. An information model
        might identify which error conditions should be counted separately,
        and which error conditions can be counted together in a single
        counter. Then, whether the counter is gathered via SNMP or a CLI
        command or a SYSLOG message, the counter will have the same
        meaning.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should consider which information might be
        useful for managing the new protocol or protocol extensions.

Management Information</h3>

<p>Languages used to describe an information model can influence the
      nature of the model. Using a particular data modeling language, such as 
      the SMIv2, influence the model to use certain types of structures, such as 
      two-dimensional tables. This document recommends using English text (the
      official language for IETF specifications) to describe an information model. 
      A sample data model could be developed to demonstrate the information 
      model.
</p>
<p>A management information model should include a discussion of what
        is manageable, which aspects of the protocol need to be configured,
        what types of operations are allowed, what protocol-specific events
        might occur, which events can be counted, and for which events should
        an operator be notified.
</p>
<p>Operators find it important to be able to make a clear distinction
        between configuration data, operational state, and statistics. They
        need to determine which parameters were administratively configured and
        which parameters have changed since configuration as the result of
        mechanisms such as routing protocols or network management protocols.
        It is important to be able to separately fetch current configuration information,
        initial configuration information, operational state information, and statistics 
        from devices, and to be able to compare current state to initial state, and to 
        compare information between devices. So when deciding what information 
        should exist, do not conflate multiple information elements into a single element.
</p>
<p>What is typically difficult to work through are relationships
        between abstract objects. Ideally an information model would describe
        the relationships between the objects and concepts in the information
        model.
</p>
<p>Is there always just one instance of this object or can there be
        multiple instances? Does this object relate to exactly one other
        object or may it relate to multiple? When is it possible to change a
        relationship?
</p>
<p>Do objects (such as rows in tables) share fate? For example, if a
        row in table A must exist before a related row in table B can be
        created, what happens to the row in table B if the related row in
        table A is deleted? Does the existence of relationships between
        objects have an impact on fate sharing?

Fault Management</h3>

<p>The protocol designer should document the basic faults and health 
      indicators that need to be instrumented for the new protocol, and the 
      alarms and events that must be propagated to management applications 
      or exposed through a data model.
</p>
<p>The protocol designer should consider how fault information will
        be propagated. Will it be done using asynchronous notifications or
        polling of health indicators?
</p>
<p>If notifications are used to alert operators to certain conditions,
        then the protocol designer should discuss mechanisms to throttle
        notifications to prevent congestion and duplications of event
        notifications. Will there be a hierarchy of faults, and will the fault
        reporting be done by each fault in the hierarchy, or will only the
        lowest fault be reported and the higher levels be suppressed? Should
        there be aggregated status indicators based on concatenation of
        propagated faults from a given domain or device?
</p>
<p>SNMP notifications and SYSLOG messages can alert an operator when
        an aspect of the new protocol fails or encounters an error or failure condition,
        and SNMP is frequently used as a heartbeat monitor. Should the event reporting 
        provide guaranteed accurate delivery of the event information within a given (high) 
        margin of confidence?  Can we poll the latest events in the box?

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.1"></a><h3>3.3.1.&nbsp;
Liveness Detection and Monitoring</h3>

<p>Liveness detection and monitoring applies both to the control
          plane and the data plane. Mechanisms for detecting faults in the
          control plane or for monitoring its liveness are usually built into
          the control plane protocols or inherited from underlying data plane
          or forwarding plane protocols. These mechanisms do not typically
          require additional management capabilities. However, when a system
          detects a control plane fault, there is often a requirement to
          coordinate recovery action through management applications or at
          least to record the fact in an event log. 
</p>
<p>Where the protocol is responsible for establishing data or user
          plane connectivity, liveness detection and monitoring usually need
          to be achieved through other mechanisms. In some cases, these
          mechanisms already exist within other protocols responsible for
          maintaining lower layer connectivity, but it will often be the case
          that new procedures are required to detect failures in the data path
          and to report rapidly, allowing remedial action to be taken.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should always build in basic testing features
          (e.g. ICMP echo, UDP/TCP echo service, NULL RPC calls) that can be
          used to test for liveness, with an option to enable and disable
          them.

Fault Determination</h3>

<p>It can be helpful to describe how faults can be pinpointed using
          management information. For example, counters might record instances
          of error conditions. Some faults might be able to be pinpointed by
          comparing the outputs of one device and the inputs of another device
          looking for anomalies.
</p>
<p>How do you distinguish between faulty messages and good messages?
</p>
<p>Would some threshold-based mechanisms, such as RMON events/alarms or the EVENT-MIB, be useable to help determine error conditions? Are SNMP notifications for all events needed, or are there some "standard" notifications that could be used? or can relevant counters be polled as needed?

Configuration Management</h3>

<p>A protocol designer should document the
basic configuration parameters that need to be instrumented for a new
protocol, as well as default values and modes of operation.
</p>
<p>What information should be maintained across reboots of the device,
        or restarts of the management system?
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3139'>"Requirements for Configuration Management of IP-based Networks"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sanchez, L., McCloghrie, K., and J. Saperia, &ldquo;Requirements for Configuration Management of IP-based Networks,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3139] discusses requirements for
        configuration management, including discussion of
        different levels of management, high-level-policies,
        network-wide configuration data, and device-local configuration. Network configuration is not just multi-device push or pull.  It is knowing that the configurations being pushed are semantically compatible.  Is the circuit between them configured compatibly on both ends?  is the is-is
metric the same? ...  now do that for 1,000 devices.

</p>
<p>A number of efforts have existed in the IETF to develop
        policy-based management. <a class='info' href='#RFC3198'>"Terminology for Policy-Based Management"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Westerinen, A., Schnizlein, J., Strassner, J., Scherling, M., Quinn, B., Herzog, S., Huynh, A., Carlson, M., Perry, J., and S. Waldbusser, &ldquo;Terminology for Policy-Based Management,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3198] was
        written to standardize the terminology
        across these efforts.
</p>
<p>Implementations should not arbitrarily modify configuration data.
   In some cases (such as Access Control Lists) the order of data
   items is significant and comprises part of the configured data. If a protocol
        designer defines mechanisms for configuration, it would be desirable
        to standardize the order of elements for consistency of configuration
        and of reporting across vendors, and across releases from vendors.
</p>
<p>There are two parts to this: 1. An NMS system
        could optimize access control lists (ACLs) for performance reasons 2. Unless the device/NMS
        systems has correct rules/a lot of experience, reordering ACLs can
        lead to a huge security issue.
</p>
<p>Network wide configurations may be stored in central master
        databases and transformed into formats that can be pushed to devices,
        either by generating sequences of CLI commands or complete
        configuration files that are pushed to devices. There is no common
        database schema for network configuration, although the models used by
        various operators are probably very similar. Many operators consider it desirable to
        extract, document, and standardize the common parts of these network
        wide configuration database schemas. A protocol designer should
        consider how to standardize the common parts of configuring the new
        protocol, while recognizing that vendors may also have proprietary
        aspects of their configurations.
</p>
<p>It is important to enable operators to concentrate on the
        configuration of the network as a whole rather than individual
        devices. Support for configuration transactions across a number of
        devices could significantly simplify network configuration management.
        The ability to distribute configurations to multiple devices, or
        modify candidate configurations on multiple devices, and then
        activate them in a near-simultaneous manner might help.  Protocol designers can consider how it would make sense for their protocol to be configured across multiple devices. Configuration-templates might also be helpful.
</p>
<p>Consensus of the 2002 IAB Workshop <a class='info' href='#RFC3535'>[RFC3535]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schoenwaelder, J., &ldquo;Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management Workshop,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> was that textual configuration
        files should be able to contain international characters.
        Human-readable strings should utilize UTF-8, and protocol elements
        should be in case insensitive ASCII.
</p>
<p>A mechanism to dump and restore configurations is a primitive
        operation needed by operators. Standards for pulling and pushing
        configurations from/to devices are desirable.
</p>
<p>Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be possible to
        generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with minimal
        state changes and effects on network and systems. It is important to
        minimize the impact caused by configuration changes.
</p>
<p>Many protocol specifications include timers that are used as part
        of operation of the protocol. These timers should have default values

Performance Management</h3>

<p>From a manageability point of view it is important to determine how well
   a network deploying the protocol or technology defined in the document 
   is doing. In order to do this the network operators need to  consider information 
   that would be useful to determine the performance characteristics of a deployed 
   system using the target protocol.  
</p>
<p>The Benchmarking Methodology WG (BMWG) has defined recommendations
        for the measurement of the performance characteristics of various
        internetworking technologies in a laboratory environment, including
        the systems or services that are built from these technologies. Each
        recommendation describes the class of equipment, system, or service
        being addressed; discuss the performance characteristics that are
        pertinent to that class; clearly identify a set of metrics that aid in
        the description of those characteristics; specify the methodologies
        required to collect said metrics; and lastly, present the requirements
        for the common, unambiguous reporting of benchmarking results.
</p>
<p>Performance metrics may be useful in multiple environments, and for different protocols. The  IP Performance Monitoring (IPPM) WG or Benchmarking (BMWG) WG may have already defined metrics that would be useful for the new protocol. In some cases, new metrics need to be defined. It would be useful if the protocol documentation identified the need for such new metrics. For performance monitoring, it is often important to report the time spent in a state rather than the current state. Snapshots are of less value for performance monitoring.
</p>
<p>There are several parts to performance management to be considered: protocol monitoring,   device monitoring (the impact of the new protocol/service activation on the device), network monitoring, and service monitoring (the impact of service activation on the network).

Monitoring the Protocol</h3>

<p>Certain properties of protocols are useful to monitor. The number of protocol packets received, the number of packets sent, and the number of packets dropped are usually very helpful to operators.
</p>
<p>Packet drops should be reflected in counter variable(s) somewhere that can be inspected - both from the security point of view and from the troubleshooting point of view.
</p>
<p>Counter definitions should be unambiguous about what is included in the count, and what is not included in the count.
</p>
<p>Consider the expected behaviors for counters - what is a reasonable
        maximum value for expected usage? Should they stop counting at the
        maximum value and retain the maximum value, or should they rollover?
        How can users determine if a rollover has occurred, and how can users
        determine if more than one rollover has occurred?

</p>
<p>Consider whether multiple management applications will share a
        counter; if so, then no one management application should be allowed
        to reset the value to zero since this will impact other
        applications. 
</p>
<p>Could events, such as hot-swapping a blade in a chassis, cause
        discontinuities in counter? Does this make any difference in
        evaluating the performance of a protocol?
</p>
<p>The protocol document should make clear the limitations 
implicit within the protocol and the behavior when limits are exceeded. This should be considered in a 
        data-modeling independent manner - what makes managed-protocol sense, not what makes
        management-protocol-sense. If constraints are not managed-protocol-dependent,
        then it should be left for the management-protocol data modelers to
        decide. For example, VLAN identifiers have a range of 1..4095 because of
        the VLAN standards. A MIB implementing a VLAN table should be able to support 4096 entries because the content being modeled requires it.

Security Management</h3>

<p>Protocol designers should consider how to monitor and to manage
        security aspects and vulnerabilities of the new protocol.
</p>
<p>There will be security considerations related to the new protocol.
        To make it possible for operators to be aware of security-related
        events, it is recommended that system logs should record events, such
        as failed logins, but the logs must be secured.
</p>
<p>Should a system automatically notify operators of every event
        occurrence, or should an operator-defined threshold control when a
        notification is sent to an operator?
</p>
<p>Should certain statistics be collected about the operation of the
        new protocol that might be useful for detecting attacks, such as the
        receipt of malformed messages, or messages out of order, or messages
        with invalid timestamps? If such statistics are collected, is it
        important to count them separately for each sender to help identify
        the source of attacks?
</p>
<p>Manageability considerations that are security-oriented might
        include discussion of the security implications when no monitoring is
        in place, the regulatory implications of absence of audit-trail or
        logs in enterprises, exceeding the capacity of logs, and security
        exposures present in chosen / recommended management mechanisms.
</p>
<p>Consider security threats that may be introduced by management operations. For example
CAPWAP breaks the structure of monolithic Access Points (AP) into Access
Controllers and Wireless Termination Points (WTP). By using a management
interface, internal information that was previously not accessible is now
exposed over the network and to management applications and may become 
a source of potential security threats.
</p>
<p>The granularity of access control needed on management interfaces
        needs to match operational needs. Typical requirements are a
        role-based access control model and the principle of least privilege,
        where a user can be given only the minimum access necessary to perform
        a required task.
</p>
<p>Some operators wish to do consistency checks of access control
        lists across devices. Protocol designers should consider information
        models to promote comparisons across devices and across vendors to
        permit checking the consistency of security configurations.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should consider how to provide a secure
        transport, authentication, identity, and access control which
        integrates well with existing key and credential management
        infrastructure. It is a good idea to start with defining the threat model for the protocol, and from that deducing what is required.
</p>
<p>Protocol designers should consider how access control lists
        are maintained and updated.
</p>
<p>Standard SNMP notifications or SYSLOG messages <a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The Syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> might already exist, or can
        be defined, to alert operators to the conditions identified in the
        security considerations for the new protocol. For 
example, you can log all the commands entered by the operator using 
syslog (giving you some degree of audit trail), or you can see who has 
logged on/off using SSH from where, failed SSH logins can be 
logged using syslog, etc.

</p>
<p>An analysis of existing counters might help operators recognize the
        conditions identified in the security considerations for the new
        protocol before they can impact the network.
</p>
<p>Different management protocols use different assumptions about message
        security and data access controls. A protocol designer that recommends
        using different protocols should consider how security will be applied
        in a balanced manner across multiple management interfaces. SNMP
        authority levels and policy are data-oriented, while CLI authority levels and policy are usually
        command (task) oriented. Depending on the management function,
        sometimes data-oriented or task-oriented approaches make more
        sense. Protocol designers should consider both data-oriented and
        task-oriented authority levels and policy.

Recommended Discussions</h3>

<p>A Manageability Considerations section should include discussion of
        the management and operations topics raised in this document, and when
        one or more of these topics is not relevant, it would be useful to
        contain a simple statement explaining why the topic is not relevant
        for the new protocol. Of course, additional relevant topics should be
        included as well.
</p>
<p>Existing protocols and data models can provide the management
        functions identified in the previous section. Protocol designers
        should consider how using existing protocols and data models might
        impact network operations.

Null Manageability Considerations Sections</h3>

<p>A protocol designer may seriously consider the manageability
        requirements of a new protocol, and determine that no management
        functionality is needed by the new protocol. It would be helpful to
        those who may update or write extensions to the protocol in the future
        or to those deploying the new protocol to know the thinking of the
        working regarding the manageability of the protocol at the time of its
        design.
</p>
<p>If there are no new manageability or deployment considerations, it
        is recommended that a Manageability Considerations section contain a
        simple statement such as "There are no new manageability requirements
        introduced by this document," and a brief explanation of why that is
        the case. The presence of such a Manageability Considerations section
        would indicate to the reader that due consideration has been given to
        manageability and operations.
</p>
<p>In the case where the new protocol is an extension, and the base
        protocol discusses all the relevant operational and manageability
        considerations, it would be helpful to point out the considerations
        section in the base document.

Placement of Operations and Manageability Considerations Sections </h3>

<p>If a protocol designer develops a Manageability Considerations
        section for a new protocol, it is recommended that the section be
        placed immediately before the Security Considerations section.
        Reviewers interested in such sections could find it easily, and this
        placement could simplify the development of tools to detect the
        presence of such a section.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This document is informational and provides guidelines for
      considering manageability and operations. It introduces no new security
      concerns.
</p>
<p>The provision of a management portal to a network device
provides a doorway through which an attack on the device may be
launched. Making the protocol under development be manageable 
through a management protocol creates a vulnerability to a new source of
attacks. Only management protocols with adequate security apparatus, such as 
authentication, message integrity checking, and authorization should be used.

</p>
<p>A standard description of the
manageable knobs and whistles on a protocol makes it easier for an
attacker to understand what they may try to control and how to
tweak it.

</p>
<p>A well-designed protocol is usually more stable and secure. A protocol 
that can be managed and inspected offers the operator
a better chance of spotting and quarantining any attacks.
Conversely making a protocol easy to inspect is a risk if the wrong
person inspects it.

</p>
<p>If security events cause logs and or notifications/alerts, 
a concerted attack might be able to be mounted by causing an excess of these
events. In other words, the security management mechanisms could
constitute a security vulnerability. The management of security aspects is important (see <a class='info' href='#secmgmt'>Section&nbsp;3.7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Management</span><span>)</span></a>).
