Abstract

   This memo describes an experimental method for the transmission of
   IP datagrams oven token-rail ethernet.
   This specification is primarily useful in
   Metropolitan Area Networks, but can be applied in economies of scale
   (N, HO, WIDE, O, and others).
   This is an experimental, not recommended standard.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
   Much of the rural United States while enjoying many modern
   conveniences is still quite limited in the available choices for
   broadband internet connectivity. This could be remedied by the use
   of an infrastructure that has existed virtually untapped for its
   communications potential. The continued advances in DSP technology,
   multiple frequency encoding and general alloy based metallurgy leads
   to the inevitable conclusion: using encoded signals transmitted over
   the information super railway could provide much needed relief to
   users in rural areas.

1. Introduction

   1.1 	Token Rail Ethernet can provide low delay, medium
	throughput, and low latency service.
   1.2  The connection topology is limited to two point-to-point paths.
   1.3	Switches may be incorporated into the rail network to provide
   	queuing and QOS, at the cost of latency.
   1.4 	Standards and policies are easily manageable as all carriers 
   	are government subsidized.
   1.5 	There is limited space available to the carriers,
	it is allotted in continuous Right of Way across great distances.
   1.6  The collision avoidance system is less than perfect but is
   	bears no direct relation to the network unless a physical rail 
   	is completely broken
   1.7	Connection oriented service are available in
    	some cities, usually based upon a central hub/turntable/switch
   	topology.

2. Frame Format

   The common frame format is based on the basic ASCII character set
   with a translation table as follows :

 2.1 	Alphabet
	._   A     __.  G     __   M     ...  S     _.__ Y
	_... B     .... H     _.   N     _    T     __.. Z
	_._. C     ..   I     ___  O     .._  U
	_..  D     .___ J     .__. P     ..._ V
	.    E     _._  K     __._ Q     .__  W
	.._. F     ._.. L     ._.  R     _.._ X
2.2 	Numbers
	.----  1              -....  6
	..---  2              --...  7
	...--  3              ---..  8
	....-  4              ----.  9
	.....  5              -----  0

2.3	Symbols
	Point (.)           .-.-.-    (AAA)
	Comma (,)           --..--    (MIM)
	Question-mark (?)   ..--..    (IMI)
	Colon (:)           ---...    (OS)
	Hyphen (-)          -....-    (BA)
	Error               ........

3. Discussion

Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized switch.
The physical implementation of connectivity to the token-rail
net may be left to the implementer
Some accepted examples include:
   High Analog/Low Analog,( V!CC)
   Carrier Sense/Carrier Nonsense,
   High Tty/Low Tty
The MTU is variable, and generally increases with signal voltage
Typical MTU is not fixed but if receive window is not
well tuned to incoming streams, retransmissions will certainly occur.
Upon receipt, datagram is aurally or machine scanned
into a uuencoded message suitable for transmission an other media
(avian Carriers and the like).

4. Security Considerations

Security is not generally a problem in normal operation,
but special measures (such as data encryption) must be taken to limit
rail access and prevent collisions
Especially when tokens are present on the rail.
