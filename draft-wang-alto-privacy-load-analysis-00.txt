Internet-Draft              Analysis for ALTO               October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Many Internet applications, including the widely used overlay
   applications like peer-to-peer file sharing and video streaming, need
   to access the resources which are available in several equivalent
   replicas on different hosts, such as pieces of information or server
   processes.  The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] is to provide guidance to
   applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set of
   candidates, which are able to provide the desired resource. is to
   provide guidance to the applications, which have to select one or
   several hosts from a set of candidates, which are able to provide the
   desired resource.

   This memo discusses the privacy and load issues which are important
   for the benefits of ISP and P2P. Although these issues have been
   extensively discussed on the ALTO mailing list, ALTO WG is still lack
   of an ideal solution satisfying all the requirements.  PROXIDOR, P4P
   and other similar solutions all have their pros and cons regarding
   all these aspects.  This draft is to do a comparative study to
   analyze and compare the privacy and workload of several existing
   solutions, hence to provide guidance in order to improve, optimize
   and employ the protocol.

1.1.  Overview

   The essential reason for risks in privacy consideration is that the
   ISP and P2P can not trust each other fully.  Network inefficiency
   caused by the emerging P2P applications challenges the Internet
   traffic controlled by ISP.  Network providers have tried various
   traffic control techniques including charging and rate throttling.
   However, different P2P protocols may use different encryption and
   dynamic ports to avoid being identified and message types are also
   various.  Furthermore, unilateral rate limiting by network providers
   may significantly degrade P2P performance and be problematic with
   consumers' needs.  ISP will also face the legal suits from its
   customers if it blocks the traffic.

   ALTO proposes an ISP-P2P cooperating method to solve the network
   traffic problem.  The first issue for P2P applications to be
   considered when using ALTO is whether ALTO can improve their
   performance in a safe way.  In ALTO's idea, P2P is guided by ISP in
   peer selection.  Some experiments, such as P4P field test, shows that
   P2P performance can be improved in many aspects such as downloading
   speed.  But in terms of privacy, existing solutions have the problem
   that they need some P2P operation information, to provide guidance
   accordingly, and it is easy to figure out P2P traffic from this
   information.  If ISP wants to shape this traffic, P2P applications

   can do nothing.  On the other hand, though ISP has high pressure in
   P2P traffic optimization, providing guidance means disclosing part of
   their privacy information, which may lead to lots of attacks or other
   risks.  Moreover, providing new service introduces new costs to ISP.
   Due to the huge number of peers, ISP servers need high capability and
   optimal designation to provide ALTO service.  Existing solutions such
   as P4P, PROXIDOR have their strong points and weak points regarding
   these aspects.


2.  Terminology and Concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the concepts defined in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] and [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs].


3.  Privacy consideration

   As declared in ALTO problem statements
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement], ISPs are required to provide their
   intimate knowledge of their network topology to address the ALTO
   problem.  However, they usually think the revealed details of such
   network information are confidential.  On the other hand, the ALTO
   client needs to provide some data that they think private in its
   query to the ALTO sever, which could help to increase the accuracy
   level in the replies.  Thus, the privacy issues need to be considered
   in ALTO protocol design.

3.1.  ISP privacy

   The security issue of ISPs concerns the potential risk of disclosing
   network topology and provision information through peer locations and
   the costs among peers.  ISPs must evaluate how much information to
   reveal and the resulted risks.  For example, if an ISP reveals
   extremely fine-grained information, it may be easier for attackers to
   infer network topology information.  ISPs should also take into
   account that revealing overly coarse-grained information may not
   provide much benefit to either themselves or applications.  If ALTO
   fails to improve the performance of P2P applications, it will not
   become popular and be used by the P2P community.  Even using
   authentication or encrypt techniques, the ISP privacy can still be
   gotten by P2P applications.  It can resolve the security problem of
   information transformation and security problem of server and client,
   but not the problem of privacy disclosing.  Thus in

Internet-Draft              Analysis for ALTO               October 2009


   [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs], the defined protocol is required to support
   different levels of details in queries and responses, in order that
   the provider f an ALTO service can be able to control the amount of
   disclosed information (e.g., about the network topology).

3.2.  P2P privacy

   In some existing solutions, in order to obtain the ranking of
   destination peers for a source peer, P2P applications need to send
   the source and destination peer pairs to ALTO server.  In this way,
   ISP can easily infer the communication pattern so that P2P traffic
   may suffer from rating or limiting actions from ISP.  It is important
   to note that there is no protocol mechanism requiring ALTO for P2P
   applications.  If P2P applications were required that the clients
   send their operational information to the server, they may be
   agitated by disclosing their information and ALTO service will be
   discarded.  Thus different levels of details in queries and responses
   [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs] also need to be supported in requirement of user
   privacy protection, in order to protect the privacy of users, to
   ensure that the operators of ALTO servers and other users of the same
   application cannot derive sensitive information.


4.  Workload considerations

   In the ALTO problem statements and requirements, the overload
   protection and caching mechanism are required for ALTO protocol.
   However, if overload happens frequently, even with protection
   mechanism, it will cause bad performance of P2P applications and also
   ISP network.

4.1.  ISP load

   The amount of peers an ALTO server needs to deal with could be
   millions.  Especially in some busy time, ALTO server may receive
   millions of requests from the client at the same time.  It causes
   overload of servers without high capability.  Therefore, the solution
   should be highly scalable when the number of clients increases fast.

   Assuming that there are n peers which are separated into t groups
   (one PID per group) requesting ALTO service at one time, if there are
   m candidates in average for each request peer, for PROXIDOR n times
   sorting are needed and for P4P n times IP-PID mapping and t*t times
   pDistance mapping are needed.  Therefore, ALTO server should be
   charge with a huge n of requests at the same time and also should be
   deal with the continuously growing n.

4.2.  P2P load

   Using ALTO services, P2P applications should request and make use of
   ALTO guidance for each peer selection.  The cost is higher than
   random peer selection.  But comparing to some unilateral traffic
   optimization methods, because P2P applications do not need to
   estimate the network traffic, its cost is lower.

   Figure 1. Basic process of P2P guidance

   The goal of P2P guidance is to provide the ranking of the destination
   peers.  The basic process of P2P guidance can be summarized as
   follows: first find the groups that the requested source and
   destination peers belong to; then calculate or search the cost of
   source and destination groups, maybe with consideration of some peer
   attributes as the cost of source and destination peers; then sort the
   costs and at last select peers according to the ranked costs.  Here,
   'group' is a set of peers defined by ISPs for the purpose of
   aggregation under similar network characteristics.  Most solutions
   use this process with different group granularities.  Finer gain of
   group granularity, such as one peer per group, performs well but
   costs more whereas coarse gain may lead to less effective guide.  In
   the second step, the cost between source and destination groups can
   be prepared in advance or calculated on the fly.  Due to the low
   efficiency and poor performance of real time computation for huge
   requests, the popular way is to calculate the cost of each peer pair/
   group pair in advance and maintains a back-end database that updates
   at pre-determined intervals or sudden changes.  Even though, for each
   request the server has to do lookup from group pairs to their cost.

   The ALTO server and client play different roles in these steps.  In
   different solutions, the server has different number of functions,
   leading to different level of ISP and P2P privacy disclosing and
   server load.  Assuming that a function is only provided by ISP or
   P2P, there will be five potential/existing solutions that support
   ALTO service.

Figure 2. Potential/existing solutions

5.1.  Solution 1

   An extreme way is that the ISP server charges all the process.  In
   this case, ISP directly forces P2P to select the peers it chooses.
   Undoubtedly all the topology information can be kept in the server
   side, but the P2P applications lose their independence and the ISP
   server may be overloaded with too much work.  This solution is not
   reasonable.

5.2.  Solution 2

   Similarly, if P2P applications charge all the process with the primal
   topology information, ISP may suffer from the risks caused by privacy
   exposition.  It is also unreasonable.

5.3.  Solution 3

   The acceptable solution is to find a strategy to divide the functions
   to server and client.  One solution is the server controls the first
   three steps of the process and the client controls the last one.  A
   representative example is PROXIDOR.  To use the PROXIDOR service, the
   client generates a standard PROXIDOR query and sends to the PROXIDOR
   server.  The PROXIDOR server that receives a query will rank the
   target IP address and then send back to the client.

   Figure 3. Basic flow of PROXIDOR

   The client can get the ranked destination peers directly.  ISP's
   privacy is kept because it is difficult to collect all costs of the
   N*N IP pairs for an N IP network.  It therefore has the advantage
   that all operational information is kept in the ALTO server and is
   not revealed to the ALTO client.  But P2P applications should provide
   all potential source and destination peer pairs.  PROXIDOR requires
   the exact destination peers per each source peer for sorting.  ISPs
   can be able to infer the communication patterns of a client from the
   queries.  P2P may be afraid of the privacy exposition so that not so
   many P2P applications choose it.

   In addition, similar to taking all functions in the server, this kind
   of 3-1 partition solutions may also have the risk of overload.  When
   various P2P applications request ALTO services simultaneously at hot
   time without caching, it is hard for the server to deal with the huge
   requests.  Even using caching, direct using IP for ranking requires
   the cache mechanism to be design carefully.

5.4.  Solution 4

   Another solution is to distribute the first two functions to the
   server and the others to the client, which is represented by P4P. In
   P4P, the server controls the first two steps of the process.  The
   client queries the server and gets the group ID (PID) for peer, and
   directly requests and obtains the cost/priority between source and
   destination groups (pDistance).

   belongs exist, they increase the possibility of privacy exposition.
   The other indirect type may not have this problem.  Through
   collection all (M*M for an N IP into M groups) or most pDistance may
   be obtained by P2P or other parties, a network topology may be
   disclosed.  Obviously, it is easier than PROXIDOR to infer a network
   topology.  However, if the reconstructed information can be obtained
   by the other ways (e.g. traceroute), it does not need to be taken
   into account much.

   In P4P, Clients can potentially disclose private information to the
   ALTO Service Portals if either PIDs are extremely fine-grained or

   Network Location Identifiers are included directly in the query.  One
   possibility is that clients only retrieve the full set of PIDs (via
   GetPIDMap) and pDistances (via GetpDistance).  Without knowing which
   one the source/destination is and how they link, it is hard for P2P
   traffic to trace for each link.  But it increases the risks of
   disclosing ISP privacy on the other hand.  In this way, other people
   can easily access all pDistances to construct a topology on group
   level.  Granularity of group decides the probability that ISP and P2P
   privacies expose to some extent.

   Regarding the traffic load, it is obvious that clients charging
   ranking step disperses the ranking cost from small numbers of servers
   to large number of clients.  Although the ranking cost is very low
   for each peer, cost of millions of ranking altogether can not be
   neglected and the delay issue should also be considered.  Moreover,
   because using group ID to request cost directly can reduce the
   request time significantly, it can also reduce the server load.  If
   there are averagely X peers in a group, then the time of request may
   decrease to 1/X or more.  If ISP provides full network map and cost
   map directly, the server's workload could be reduced more.  Most time
   it only needs to response to some timely requests.

5.5.  Solution 5

   In the case that P2P and ISP can not fully trust each other, another
   possible way is to provide necessary ISP information for P2P guidance
   without requesting P2P's operational information.  Comparing with
   other solutions in the figure, the characteristic of the last
   solution is that the server controls the first step and the client
   gets the costs of peer pairs, sorts the cost and then does the peer
   selection only according to group IDs.  In other solutions such as
   2-2 partition, the group ID denoting Network Location Identifiers can
   not represent cost relationship without a cost map.  Instead, in this
   solution the group ID for a peer could be used as the carrier which
   also implies the cost to the other peer indirectly.

   In section Section 5.4, 2-2 partition solutions such as P4P uses two
   steps to guide P2P: obtaining PIDs for the source and destination
   peer, and getting pDistance between the source PID and destination
   PIDs.  Incorporating the two steps in P4P, in 1-3 partition solution
   ISP guides P2P through PID/group ID only.  First ISP uses full set of
   pDistance to construct the set of PIDs.  These PIDs are only a set of
   ruleless numbers, but from simple calculation with two PIDs the
   pDistance between these two PID could be obtained.  In this way, the
   same performance as P4P could be obtained and the requests of getting
   pDistance could also be avoided.  ISP doesn't need P2P operational
   details, which can reduce the risk of disclosing P2P privacy.  Even
   in the structured P2P network, some surrogate or transfer mechanisms

   can be used to avoid source peer information being disclosed.
   Although the ISP topology information can be inferred by the full
   collection of PIDs as P4P, a correct computational function or driver
   still need to be obtained additionally to calculate the corresponding
   cost value.  Moreover, the load on the ALTO server can be re-balanced
   to ALTO server and ALTO clients together.

   The methods for constructing PIDs from pDistances are various, which
   can be freely adopted by ISP.  The most appropriate PID type needs to
   be further verified.

5.6.  Merged solutions

   The solutions discussed above are just simple classification.  A
   function may have different criterions and implementations in
   different solutions.  And a function may be charged not by ISP or P2P
   alone.  A cooperative way and a reliable third party can also be a
   reasonable manager.  A merged solution may satisfy different
   requirements.  For different P2P applications ISP can provide
   different solutions according to their credits or other stipulations.
   But this kind of merged solutions should be designed carefully to
   make the protocol in phase.  Furthermore, the merged solutions may
   have the cons of the individual solutions.  Of course, good
   combinations can make them complementary to each other and improve
   the advantages of protocol.  However, providing multiple solutions
   simultaneously will result in the increase of workload.  Moreover,
   aggregation of multiple solutions may introduce privacy concern of
   these solutions which increase both ISP and P2P privacy risks in the
   merged protocol.

5.7.  Conclusion

   In most cases, the more functions the ISP controls, the more cost the
   ISP spends and the less privacy the ISP discloses, but more P2P
   information is needed.  On the other hand, if P2P controls more
   functions, P2P information may not be open to ISP, but it means that
   ISP may have to provide some sensitive information to P2P. In
   conclusion, the protocol should provide at least the basic mechanisms
   to deal with the privacy issue and it should be scaleable.  The
   requirements [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs] for supporting mutual
   authentication of clients and servers are declared.  But it is not
   enough when clients prefer to avoid explicit authentication and have
   privacy related to a network location basis.  Currently ISP and P2P
   can not trust each other completely for some reasons.  P2P may want
   much guidance which is sensitive to ISP.  On the other hand, the
   protection of ISP privacy may damage P2P privacy and lead to server
   overload.  Such conflictions should be solved, so there are
   implications cannot be ignored.  Such mechanisms should reach a

   balance between the benefits and requirements of ISP and P2P.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security issues have been taken into account in design
   considerations.  An ALTO Server may optionally use authentication and
   encryption to protect ALTO information.  Note that it can only
   prevent the information being disclosed on the path, but can not
   prevent the information being redistributed by p2p applications.
   This will be further discussed in other documents.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA action required by this draft.
