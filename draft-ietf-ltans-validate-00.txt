Abstract

   Digitally signed documents and data in a LTANS service receive the
   signature renwal procedures and non-repudiation services.  As
   documents can be stored for very long (theoretically inifinite)
   times, it is very important to understand which data is and will be
   necessary for the verification of the contained digital signatures
   and the applied timestamps and the evidence records.  This document

Internet-Draft              Verification Data               October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Data and documents stored in Long term archiving services may contain
   digitally signed or encrypted data and their integrity may be assured
   with the used of timestamps and archivetimestamps as sepcified in
   ERS.  As such data and it's proof of existance and non-repudiation
   may be verified at a point in time very far in the future, it is very
   important to analyse and understand what information may be needed
   for this verification and what controls need to be implemented to
   ensure the avaliability and integrity of this data.


2.  Verification data for Evidence Records

   Evidence Records contain hashtrrees secured with time stamps.  The
   security and verification of the hhashtrees basically only depends on
   the used hash algorithm and its possible parameters.  In general no
   external verification data like CRLs are necessary.

   The time stamps used in the Evidence Record are based on digital
   signatures and for this need besides the information about the used
   algorithms also additional verification data like Certificate
   Revolcation Lists (CRLs), OCSP responses and certificates of all
   parties involved in the issuance of the time stamp certificate.

   To correctly verify the time stamps in the Evidence Record an expert
   needs in every case to verify that the used private key has not been
   compromised before it has been used.  Which means the verifier needs
   a OCSP resonse or a CRL to verify that the cused certificate has not
   been revocated.

   Additionally to fully evauluate the correct chain of issuers all
   cetrificates up to the root need to be checked.

   In cases where an specailly accredited authority has issued the
   trusted time stamp authority, it could be assumed that the compromise
   of the used keys would have so much impact that it would be publicly
   known even without directly checking the CRL or OCSP status of the
   used certificate.  This situation can justify that it is only
   necessary to store all certificates but no CRL or OCSP response with
   the time stamp used in teh Evdience Record.


3.  Verification data for docuemnts secured by the Evidence Records

   All verification data for the documents stored in the system needs to
   be protected and stored in a non-repudiation system for the whole
   time where a later verification is needed.

   This explecitaly includes OCSP or CRL data and all certificates
   (including the complete chains for the used signatures.


4.  Security Considerations

   Long term availability and integrity of verification data

   The verification data has to be stored and available including non-
   repudiation for all verification data.
