         A Profile for Autonomous System Provider Authorization
                   draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile-05

Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for Autonomous System
   Provider Authorization in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure.  An
   Autonomous System Provider Authorization is a digitally signed object
   that provides a means of verifying that a Customer Autonomous System
   holder has authorized members of Provider set to be its upstream
   providers and for the Providers to send prefixes received from the
   Customer Autonomous System in all directions including providers and
   peers.

1.  Introduction

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve routing security.  (See [RFC6480] for more
   information.)  As part of this infrastructure, a mechanism is needed
   to verify that a AS has permission from a Customer AS (CAS) holder to
   send routes in all directions.  The digitally signed Autonomous

   System Provider Authorization (ASPA) object provides this
   verification mechanism.

   The ASPA uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects
   [RFC6488], which defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   [RFC5652] wrapper for the ASPA content as well as a generic
   validation procedure for RPKI signed objects.  As ASPAs need to be
   validated with RPKI certificates issued by the current
   infrastructure, we assume the mandatory-to-implement algorithms in
   [RFC6485], or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the ASPA (see Section 4 of
   [RFC6488]), this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the ASPA signed
       object.  This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure).

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the ASPA content, which is the payload
       signed by the CAS.  The ASPA content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X690].

   3.  The steps required to validate an ASPA beyond the validation
       steps specified in [RFC6488]).

2.  The ASPA Content Type

   The content-type for an ASPA is defined as id-cct-ASPA, which has the
   numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.  This OID MUST appear
   both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo structure as
   well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo
   structure (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The ASPA eContent

   The content of an ASPA identifies the Customer AS (CAS) as well as
   the Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) that are authorized to further
   propagate announcements received from the customer.  If customer has
   multiple providers they MUST be registered in a single ASPA object.
   This rule is important to avoid possible race conditions during
   updates.  An ASPA is formally defined as:

       ct-ASPA CONTENT-TYPE ::=
           { ASProviderAttestation IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-ASPA }

       id-ct-ASPA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct TBD }

       ASProviderAttestation ::= SEQUENCE {
           version [0] ASPAVersion DEFAULT v0,
           aFI  AddressFamilyIdentifier,
           customerASID  ASID,

       ASPAVersion ::= INTEGER  { v0(0) }

       AddressFamilyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (2))

       ASID ::= INTEGER

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo as specified in [RFC6488].

3.1.  version

   The version number of the ASProviderAttestation MUST be v0.

3.2.  AFI

   The AFI field contains Address Family Identifier for which the
   relation between customer and provider ASes is authorized.  Presently
   defined values for the Address Family Identifier field are specified
   in the IANA's Address Family Numbers registry [IANA-AF].

3.3.  customerASID

   The customerASID field contains the AS number of the Autonomous
   System that authorizes an upstream providers (listed in the
   providerASSET) to propagate prefixes in the specified address family
   other ASes.

3.4.  providerASSET

   The providerASSET contains the sequence (set) of AS numbers that are
   authorized to further propagate announcements in the specified
   address family received from the customer.

4.  ASPA Validation

   Before a relying party can use an ASPA to validate a routing
   announcement, the relying party MUST first validate the ASPA object
   itself.  To validate an ASPA, the relying party MUST perform all the
   validation checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following
   additional ASPA-specific validation step.

   o  The autonomous system identifier delegation extension [RFC3779] is
      present in the end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the
      ASPA), and the customer AS number in the ASPA is contained within
      the set of AS numbers specified by the EE certificate's autonomous
      system identifier delegation extension.

7.  Security Considerations

   While it's not restricted, but it's highly recommended maintaining
   for selected Customer AS a single ASPA object that covers all its
   providers.  Such policy should prevent race conditions during ASPA
   updates that might affect prefix propagation.  The software that
   provides hosting for ASPA records SHOULD support enforcement of this
   rule.  In the case of the transition process between different CA
   registries, the ASPA records SHOULD be kept identical in all
   registries.
