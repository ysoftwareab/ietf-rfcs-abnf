               OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attribute Advertisement
                draft-ietf-ospf-prefix-link-attr-06.txt

Abstract

   OSPFv2 requires functional extension beyond what can readily be done
   with the fixed-format Link State Advertisements (LSAs) as described
   in RFC 2328.  This document defines OSPF opaque LSAs based on Type-
   Length-Value (TLV) tuples that can be used to associate additional
   attributes with prefixes or links.  Dependent on the application,
   these prefixes and links may or not be advertised in the fixed-format
   LSAs.  The OSPF opaque LSAs are optional and fully backward
   compatible.

1.  Introduction

   OSPFv2 requires functional extension beyond what can readily be done
   with the fixed-format Link State Advertisements (LSAs) as described
   in RFC 2328 [OSPFV2].  This document defines OSPF opaque LSAs based
   on Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples that can be used to associate
   additional attributes with prefixes or links.  Dependent on the
   application, these prefixes and links may or not be advertised in the
   fixed-format LSAs.  The OSPF opaque LSAs are optional and fully
   backward compatible.  This is in contrast to the approach taken in
   OSPFv3 [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend] where the existing LSAs will
   be replaced by TLV-based extended LSAs.

   New requirements such as source/destination routing, route tagging,
   and segment routing necessitate this extension.

   This specification defines the following OSPFv2 opaque LSAs:

   1.  OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA - Allows advertisement of
       additional attributes for prefixes advertised in Router-LSAs,
       Network-LSAs, Network-Summary-LSAs, NSSA-LSAs, and AS-External-
       LSAs [OSPFV2]

   2.  OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA - Allows advertisement of
       additional attributes for links advertised in Router-LSAs.

   Additionally, the following TLVs are defined:

   1.  OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV - Top-level TLV advertising attributes
       for a prefix in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA.

   2.  OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV - Top-level TLV advertising attributes
       for a link in the OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA

   The OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA will be used to advertise
   additional prefix attributes.  Opaque LSAs are described in [OPAQUE].

Internet-Draft        OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attributes            June 2015


   Multiple OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs can be advertised by an
   OSPFv2 router.  The flooding scope of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
   Opaque LSA depends on the scope of the advertised prefixes and is
   under the control of the advertising router.  In some cases (e.g.,
   mapping server deployment), the LSA flooding scope may be greater
   than the scope of the corresponding prefixes.

   The format of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |                                                               |
      +-                            TLVs                             -+
      |                             ...                               |

                     OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA

   The opaque type used by OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA is 7.

   The Instance field is an arbitrary value used to maintain multiple
   Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs.  A maximum of 16777216 Extended Prefix
   Opaque LSAs may be sourced by a single OSPF instance.

   The format of the TLVs within the body of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
   Opaque LSA is the same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering
   Extensions to OSPF [TE].  The variable TLV section consists of one or
   more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples.  Nested TLVs are also
   referred to as sub-TLVs.  The format of each TLV is:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                TLV Format

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the length
   field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the total
   size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 32-bit
   aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field set
   to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the value
   portion of the TLV.

2.1.  OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV

   The OSPF Extended Prefix TLV is used to advertise additional
   attributes associated with the prefix.  Multiple OSPF Extended Prefix
   TLVs MAY be advertised in each OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA.
   However, since the opaque LSA type defines the flooding scope, the
   LSA flooding scope MUST satisfy the application specific requirements
   for all the prefixes included in a single OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
   Opaque LSA.  The OSPF Extended Prefix TLV has the following format:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Type
      The TLV type.  Suggested value is 1.

   Length
      Variable dependent on sub-TLVs.

   Route Type
      Route type: type of the OSPF route.  If the route type is 0
      (Unspecified), the information inside the OSPF External Prefix TLV
      applies to the prefix regardless of prefix's route-type.  This is
      useful when prefix specific attributes are advertised by an
      external entity, which is not aware of the route-type associated
      with the prefix.  Supported types are:

         0 - Unspecified

         1 - Intra-Area

         3 - Inter-Area

         5 - AS External

         7 - NSSA External

   Prefix Length
      Length in of the prefix in bits.

   AF
      Address family for the prefix.  Currently, the only supported
      value is 0 for IPv4 unicast.

      Flags: 1 octet field.  The following flags are defined:


     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   |A |N |  |  |  |  |  |  |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   where:

         A-Flag: Attach flag.  An ABR generating Extended Prefix TLV for
         inter-area prefix that is locally connected or attached in
         other connected area SHOULD set this flag.

         N-Flag: Set when the prefix identifies the advertising router
         i.e., the prefix is a host prefix advertising a globally
         reachable address typically associated with a loopback address.

Internet-Draft        OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attributes            June 2015


         The advertising router MAY choose to NOT set this flag even
         when the above conditions are met.  If the flag is set and the
         prefix length is NOT a host prefix then the flag MUST be
         ignored.  The flag is preserved when OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
         Opaque LSA is propagated between areas.

   Address Prefix
      The prefix itself encoded as an even multiple of 32-bit words,
      padded with zeroed bits as necessary.  This encoding consumes
      ((PrefixLength + 31) / 32) 32-bit words.  The default route is
      represented by a prefix of length 0.

   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the same prefix in the
   same OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA, only the first instance is
   used by receiving OSPFv2 Routers.  This situation SHOULD be logged as
   an error.

   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the same prefix in
   different OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs originated by the same
   OSPF router, the OSPF advertising router is re-originating Extended
   Prefix Opaque LSAs for multiple prefixes and is most likely repacking
   Extended-Prefix-TLVs in Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs.  In this case,
   the Extended-Prefix-TLV in the Extended Prefix Opaque LSA with the
   smallest Instance is used by receiving OSPFv2 Routers.  This
   situation MAY be logged as a warning.

   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPF routers advertising Extended Prefix TLVs
   in different Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs re-originate these LSAs in
   ascending order of Instance to minimize the disruption.

   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the same prefix in
   different OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs originated by the
   different OSPF routers, the application using the information is
   required to determine which OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA is
   used.  For example, the application could prefer the LSA providing
   the best path to the prefix.

   This document creates a registry for OSPF Extended Prefix sub-TLVs in
   Section 7.

3.  OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA

   The OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA will be used to advertise
   additional link attributes.  Opaque LSAs are described in [OPAQUE].

   The OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA has an area flooding scope.
   Multiple OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSAs can be advertised by a
   single router in an area.

      |                             ...                               |


                      OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA

   The Opaque type used by OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA is 8.

   The Instance field is an arbitrary value used to maintain multiple
   Extended Link Opaque LSAs.  A maximum of 16777216 Extended Link
   Opaque LSAs may be sourced by a single OSPF instance.

   The format of the TLVs within the body of the OSPFv2 Extended Link
   Opaque LSA is the same as described in Section 2.

3.1.  OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV

   The OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV is used to advertise various attributes
   of the link.  It describes a single link and is constructed of a set
   of Sub-TLVs.  There are no ordering requirements for the Sub-TLVs.
   Only one Extended Link TLV SHALL be advertised in each Extended Link

                         OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV


   Type
      The TLV type.  Suggested value is 1.

   Length
      Variable dependent on sub-TLVs.

   Link-Type
      Link-Type is defined in section A.4.2 of [OSPFV2].

   Link-ID
      Link-ID is defined in section A.4.2 of [OSPFV2].

   Link Data
      Link-Data is defined in section A.4.2 of [OSPFV2].

   If this TLV is advertised multiple times in the same OSPFv2 Extended
   Link Opaque LSA, only the first instance is used by receiving OSPFv2
   Routers.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the same link in
   different OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSAs originated by the same
   OSPF router, the Extended Link TLV in the Extended Link Opaque LSA
   with the smallest Instance is used by receiving OSPFv2 Routers.  This
   situation MAY be logged as a warning.

   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPF routers advertising Extended Link TLVs in
   different Extended Link Opaque LSAs re-originate these LSAs in
   ascending order of Instance to minimize the disruption.

   This document creates a registry for OSPF Extended Link sub-TLVs in
   Section 7.

4.  Backward Compatibility

   Since opaque OSPFv2 LSAs are optional and backward compatible
   [OPAQUE], the extensions described herein is fully backward
   compatible.  However, future OSPFv2 extensions utilizing these
   extensions must address backward compatibility of the corresponding
   functionality.

5.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.1.  Implementation Survey Results

   An implementation survey with seven questions related to the
   implementer's support of OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attributes was sent to
   the OSPF WG list and several known implementers.  This section
   contains responses from four implementers who completed the survey.
   No external means were used to verify the accuracy of the information
   submitted by the respondents.  The respondents are considered experts
   on the products they reported on.  Additionally, responses were
   omitted from implementers who indicated that they have not
   implemented the function yet.

   Four vendors and one open source entity replied to the survey.  These
   included Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Huawei, Juniper, and FreeRouter
   (http://freerouter.nop.hu).  Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent also did

   interoperability testing.  FreeRouter did interoperability testing
   with Cisco.  The Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and FreeRouter
   implementations are in released software versions.  The Huawei and
   Juniper implementation software releases are pending.  For prefix
   attributes, the recent change incorporating the A-Flag is pending
   implementation for all four vendors.  The FreeRouter implementation
   includes support for the A-Flag.  Implementation of the N-flag is
   pending for the Huawei and Juniper implementations.  Otherwise, all
   the survey respondents have full implementations.  For all four
   vendors and the FreeRouter implementation, segment routing
   [SEGMENT-ROUTING] was an application making use of the extensions.
   Additionally, Cisco has implemented Topology-Independent Loop-Free
   Alternatives (TI-LFA) [TI-LFA] and Bit Indexed Egress Replication
   (BIER) advertisement [BIER].

   Alcatel-Lucent's support of this specification is included in SR OS,
   Release 13.0.R4.  Cisco's support is included in IOS-XR 5.3.2.  The
   FreeRouter implementation is available in the FreeRouter 15.6.4
   distribution.  Huawei and Juniper will respectively provide support
   in future versions Versatile Routing Platform (VRP) and JUniper
   Network Operating System (JUNOS).

6.  Security Considerations

   In general, new LSAs defined in this document are subject to the same
   security concerns as those described in [OSPFV2].  Additionally,
   implementations must assure that malformed TLV and Sub-TLV
   permutations do not result in errors that cause hard OSPF failures.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates the Opaque Link-State Advertisements (LSA)
   Option Types with the following values:

   o  7 (IANA Early Allocation [RFC7120]) - OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
      Opaque LSA

   o  8 (IANA Early Allocation [RFC7120]) - OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque
      LSA

   This specification also creates four new registries:

   o  OSPF Extended Prefix Opaque LSA TLVs

   o  OSPF Extended Prefix TLV Sub-TLVs

   o  OSPF Extended Link Opaque LSA TLVs

   o  OSPF Extended Link TLV Sub-TLVs

7.1.  OSPF Extended Prefix Opaque LSA TLV Registry

   The OSPF Extend Prefix Opaque LSA TLV registry will define top-level
   TLVs for Extended Prefix Opaque LSA and should be placed in the
   existing OSPF IANA registry.  New values can be allocated via IETF
   Consensus or IESG Approval.

   The following initial values are allocated:

   o  0 - Reserved

   o  1 - OSPF Extended Prefix TLV

   Types in the range 32768-33023 are for experimental use; these will
   not be registered with IANA, and MUST NOT be mentioned by RFCs.

   Types in the range 33024-65535 are not to be assigned at this time.
   Before any assignments can be made in the 33024-65535 range, there
   MUST be an IETF specification that specifies IANA Considerations that
   covers the range being assigned.

7.2.  OSPF Extended Prefix TLV Sub-TLV Registry

   The OSPF Extended Prefix TLV sub-TLV registry will define sub-TLVs at
   any level of nesting for Extended Prefix TLV and should be placed in
   the existing OSPF IANA registry.  New values can be allocated via
   IETF Consensus or IESG Approval.

   The following initial values are allocated:

   o  0 - Reserved

   Types in the range 32768-33023 are for experimental use; these will
   not be registered with IANA, and MUST NOT be mentioned by RFCs.

   Types in the range 33024-65535 are not to be assigned at this time.
   Before any assignments can be made in the 33024-65535 range, there
   MUST be an IETF specification that specifies IANA Considerations that
   covers the range being assigned.

7.3.  OSPF Extended Link Opaque LSA TLV Registry

   The OSPF Extended Link Opaque LSA TLV registry will define top-level
   TLVs for Extended Link Opaque LSAs and should be placed in the
   existing OSPF IANA registry.  New values can be allocated via IETF
   Consensus or IESG Approval.

   Before any assignments can be made in the 33024-65535 range, there
   MUST be am IETF specification that specifies IANA Considerations that
   covers the range being assigned.

7.4.  OSPF Extended Link TLV Sub-TLV Registry

   The OSPF Extended Link TLV sub-TLV registry will define sub-TLVs at
   any level of nesting for Extended Link TLV and should be placed in
   the existing OSPF IANA registry.  New values can be allocated via
   IETF Consensus or IESG Approval.

   The following initial values are allocated:

   o  0 - Reserved

   Types in the range 32768-33023 are for experimental use; these will
   not be registered with IANA, and MUST NOT be mentioned by RFCs.
   Types in the range 33024-65535 are not to be assigned at this time.
   Before any assignments can be made in the 33024-65535 range, there
   MUST be an IETF specification that specifies IANA Considerations that
   covers the range being assigned.
