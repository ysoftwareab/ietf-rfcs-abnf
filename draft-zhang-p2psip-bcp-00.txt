1. Introduction

   DSN[1],the abbreviation of Distributed Services Network, is a new
   question being standardized in ITU-T proposed by China Mobile. In
   ITU-T DSN is defined as DSN is the evolution of NGN driven by p2p
   technology which provides distributed, operatable and manageable
   characteristics to support more carriers' grade rich multimedia
   services beyond current NGN scope. [2] outlines the DSN Architecture.
   As described in [2], DSN can support many applications ,such as

   Multimedia telephony services, Streaming services, Content
   distribution service and so on.

   Based on the theory of DSN and P2PSIP, DSN VoIP system is designed.
   According to [1], DSN VoIP system includes two sublayers over IP
   network:DHT overlay sublayer and VoIP sublayer. VoIP sublayer uses
   SIP protocol for call and DHT overlay sublayer uses RELOAD[3]
   protocol for routing calls in Overlay.

   We introduce the system architecture, components and key technologies,
   then we do some measurement for validating system.

            Figure 1 The architecture of DSN VoIP system

   VoIP sublayer includes the following functions: registration and
   authentication, session control, basic call transaction and QoS
   control,etc. VoIP sublayer implements P2P call services by DHT
   overlay sublayer resource scheduling.

   DHT overlay sublayer is the base of the implemention of DSN VoIP
   service and the basic p2p functions are involved here. This sublayer
   can carry out the following functions(not limited these):

   1. basic P2P overlay network functions, such as P2P index, routing
      and topology updating and so on;

Internet-Draft               P2PSIP BCP                     March 2010


   2. utilize the P2P overlay network function to implement distributed
      user data storage ,traffic relay and load balance.

3.2. System Framework and Components

   DSN VoIP system includes distributed servers and user terminals.
   These servers form the DSN VoIP network through P2P protocol and
   share load for each other. According to the different function, the
   server can be Peer Node(PN), Application Server(AS), Enrollment
   Server(ES), Edge Agent(EA), Relay Node(RN) and RN Cluster Server(RCS).
   According to the support for P2P protocol, the user terminal can be
   the traditional SIP Client(SiC) and Peer Client(PeC). The DSN VoIP
   system framework is shown as figure 2.

      Figure 2 The framework and components of DSN VoIP system

   Peer Node(PN): PN is the core node in DSN VoIP network and is
   deployed by telecom operators. PN is responsible for DHT topology
   Maintenance,overlay routing, storage and access for user/service data,
   user registration and Authentication, BootStrap, SIP session control
   and VoIP service.

Internet-Draft               P2PSIP BCP                     March 2010


   Application Server(AS): AS can provide other services which can't be
   provided by Peer Node(PN).

   Enrollment Server(ES): ES provides BootStrap service when the PeC or
   PN first joins the DSN VoIP network. When new PN joins, ES is
   responsible for Authentication for the new node. ES is deployed by
   telecom operators and fixed in the network.

   Edge Agent(EA):EA provide relay service for SiC and adapt all kinds
   of services and connections to PN. EA support SIP proxy ,discovery
   for DSN and connection with PN.

   Relay Node(RN): RN is responsible for NAT traversal and media traffic
   forwarding. RN can discovery DSN and connection with PN. RN can be
   deployed by telecom operators or upgraded PeC.

   RN Cluster Server(RCS): RCS is responsible for the management of RN
   nodes according to topology information or RTT(Round-Trip Time). RCS
   manages one AS field and assigns a suitable RN for PeC according to
   the information about PeC's request or location etc.

   SIP Client(SiC): SiC support only SIP protocol and can't discovery
   the DSN network if directly connected to the DSN. It must connect
   directly with Edge Agent(EA).

   Peer Client(PeC): PeC support both SIP protocol and P2P protocol. PeC
   can be upgraded to be Relay Node(RN) or RN Cluster, but can't be Peer
   Node(PN).

   PN nodes form the DSN VoIP network and interconnect through P2P
   protocol. The user terminal can get valid service once it connects to
   any PN. If some but not all PN nodes fail or go offline, this will
   not affect the normal operation of DSN network. We can add more new
   PN nodes to enlarge the capacity of DSN network.
