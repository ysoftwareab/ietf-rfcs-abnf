Internet-Draft      TLS/DTLS Auth Using M2M Certs            March 2015


Abstract

This memo defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) extensions and
associated semantics that allow clients and servers to negotiate the
use of M2M certificates for a TLS/DTLS session, and specifies how to
transport M2M certificates via TLS/DTLS.  It also defines the registry
for non-X.509 certificate types.

The X.509 public key certificate format is overly verbose for Internet-
of-Things (IoT) constrained environments, where nodes with limited
memory and networks with limited bandwidth are not uncommon.  The
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format is a pruned down and
encoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which reuses much of the
X.509 semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically 40%.

1. Introduction

   This document specifies a way to negotiate the use of M2M
   certificates [M2M-CER] for a TLS/DTLS session, and specifies how to
   transport M2M certificates via TLS/DTLS.  The proposed extensions are
   backward compatible with the current TLS/DTLS specification, so that
   existing client and server implementations that make use of X.509
   certificates are not affected.

   The predominant public key certificate format has for many years been
   the X.509 format [RFC5280].  X.509 was designed to be extremely
   flexible and open-ended, in an environment of RSA and DSA signature
   technologies.  X.509 is not, however, a good certificate format for
   Internet-of-Things constrained environments, where nodes with limited
   memory and networks with limited bandwidth are not uncommon.  With
   RSA and DSA technologies, overheads in the certificate format were

Internet-Draft      TLS/DTLS Auth Using M2M Certs            March 2015


   comparatively inconsequential because the large key and signature
   fields were the dominant certificate components size-wise.  However,
   with the much more efficient ECC technology used today, the
   certificate format overheads become a very important factor in making
   certificates efficient enough for low bandwidth constrained
   applications.  In essence, the X.509 certificate format is too
   verbose for these applications.

   The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format was designed to
   satisfy the above objectives.  Essentially what was done was to strip
   down the X.509 format to eliminate features that are not needed
   today, while optimizing the encoding.  The result is a certificate
   format that typically reduces certificate size by about 40% compared
   with X.509.

   The M2M certificate format has been adopted by the NFC Forum for Near
   Field Communications (NFC) signatures, and published by that
   organization [NFC-SIG].  However it is a general-purpose design,
   which is equally applicable to Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.

   We are proposing that IETF recognize the M2M format as an optional
   replacement for X.509 in TLS Protocol [RFC5246] and DTLS Protocol
   [RFC6347] specifications.  A companion Internet-Draft defines the M2M
   format [M2M-CER].

2. Terminology

   This document uses the same notation and terminology used in the TLS
   Protocol specification [RFC5246] and DTLS Protocol specification
   [RFC6347].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Changes to the Handshake Message Contents

   This section describes the changes to the TLS/DTLS handshake message
   contents when M2M certificates are to be used for authentication.
   When the document refers to the TLS extensions [RFC5246], the same
   extensions may be used for the DTLS handshake.

3.1. Client Hello

   In order to indicate the support of multiple certificate types,
   clients MUST include an extension of type "cert_type" to the extended
   client hello message.  The "cert_type" TLS extension is assigned the


Poeluev & Ford        Expires September 23, 2015               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      TLS/DTLS Auth Using M2M Certs            March 2015


   value of 9 from the TLS ExtensionType registry.  This value is used
   as the extension number for the extensions in both the client hello
   message and the server hello message.  The hello extension mechanism
   is described in [RFC5246].

   This extension carries a list of supported certificate types the
   client can use, sorted by client preference.  This extension MUST be
   omitted if the client only supports X.509 certificates.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure.  Note that the
   CertificateTypeExtension structure is being used both by the client
   and the server, even though the structure is only specified once in
   this document.  Reusing a single specification for both client and
   server is common in other specifications, such as the TLS protocol
   itself [RFC5246].

         enum { client, server } ClientOrServerExtension;

         enum { X.509(0), OpenPGP(1), RawPublicKey(2), M2M(3), (255) }

            CertificateType;

         struct {

            select(ClientOrServerExtension) {

               case client:

                  CertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;

               case server:

                  CertificateType certificate_type;

            }

         } CertificateTypeExtension;

   No new cipher suites are required to use M2M certificates.  All
   existing cipher suites that support a key exchange method compatible
   with the key in the certificate can be used in combination with M2M
   certificates.

3.2. Server Hello

   If the server receives a client hello that contains the "cert_type"
   extension and chooses a cipher suite that requires a certificate,


Poeluev & Ford        Expires September 23, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      TLS/DTLS Auth Using M2M Certs            March 2015


   then two outcomes are possible.  The server MUST either select a
   certificate type from the certificate_types field in the extended
   client hello or terminate the session with a fatal alert of type
   "unsupported_certificate".

   The certificate type selected by the server is encoded in a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure, which is included in the extended
   server hello message using an extension of type "cert_type".  Servers
   that only support X.509 certificates MAY omit including the
   "cert_type" extension in the extended server hello.

3.3. Server and Client Certificates

   The contents of the certificate message sent from server to client
   and vice versa are determined by the negotiated certificate type and
   the selected cipher suite's key exchange algorithm.

   When present in the TLS/DTLS handshake, M2M certificates must be
   encoded using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.680].

   To carry the M2M certificate within the TLS/DTLS handshake, the
   Certificate payload is used as a container, as shown in Figure 1.
   The shown Certificate structure is an adaptation of its original form
   [RFC5246].

         opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

         struct {

            select(certificate_type){

               // M2M certificate type defined [M2M-CER]

               case M2M:

                  ASN.1Cert m2m_certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;



               // X.509 certificate defined in [RFC5246]

               case X.509:

                  ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;

               // Additional certificate type based on

               // "TLS Certificate Types" subregistry

            };

         } Certificate;

3.4. Other Handshake Messages

   All the other handshake messages are identical to the TLS/DTLS
   specifications, [RFC5246]/[RFC6347].

4. Security Considerations

   All security considerations discussed in [RFC5246], [RFC6066], and
   [RFC4880] apply to this document.  Considerations about the use of
   the web of trust or identity and certificate verification procedures
   are outside the scope of this document.  These are considered issues
   to be handled by the application layer protocols.

   The protocol for certificate type negotiation is identical in
   operation to cipher suite negotiation as described in the TLS
   specification [RFC5246], with the addition of default values when the
   extension is omitted.  Since those omissions have a unique meaning
   and the same protection is applied to the values as with cipher
   suites, it is believed that the security properties of this
   negotiation are the same as with cipher suite negotiation.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document uses a registry and the "cert_type" extension
   originally defined in [RFC6091].

   In order to support M2M certificates the "TLS Certificate Types"
   registry established by [RFC6091] and [RFC7250] will need to be
   updated in the following ways:

   1. Value 0 (X.509), value 1 (OpenPGP), value 2 (RawPublicKey), and
      value 3 (M2M) are defined in this document.

   2. Values from 4 through 223 decimal inclusive are assigned via "RFC
      Required" [RFC5226].

   3. Values from 224 decimal through 255 decimal inclusive are reserved
      for Private Use [RFC5226].

6. Conclusions

   The IETF, Transport Layer Security and other applicable Working
   Groups are encouraged to adopt the M2M certificate format as an
   optional alternative to the X.509 format in all applications in the
   Internet-of-Things space.  There are significant size and bandwidth
   savings and no significant loss of features of practical importance.
