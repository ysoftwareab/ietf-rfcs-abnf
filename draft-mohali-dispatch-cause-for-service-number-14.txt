Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Cause URI parameter for Service Number
                              translation
         draft-mohali-dispatch-cause-for-service-number-14.txt

Abstract

   RFC4458 (SIP URIs for applications) defines a "cause" URI parameter,
   which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to
   indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server
   (UAS) receiving the message.  This document creates a new predefined
   value for the "cause" URI parameter to cover service number
   translation for cases of retargeting due to specific service action
   leading to the translation of a called service access number.  This
   document also provides guidance, which was missing in RFC4458, for
   using the "cause" URI parameter within the History-Info header field
   since this use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.

   This document updates RFC4458.

1.  Introduction, Terminology and Overview

   [RFC4458] defines a mechanism to identify retargeting due to call
   forwarding supplementary services.  The "cause" URI parameter in the
   target URI identifies the reason for retargeting and has defined
   values equivalent to the TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) Redirecting
   Reasons [ITU-T_Q.763].  The concept of "retargeting" is defined in
   [RFC7044].

   In the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)/ Integrated Services
   Digital Network (ISDN), there is another kind of retargeting
   introduced by the Intelligent Network (IN) services based on a
   translation of the called number as mentioned in [ITU-T_Q.1214].
   Indeed, IN aims to ease the introduction of new services (i.e.
   Universal Personal Telecommunication (UPT), Virtual Private Network
   (VPN), Freephone, etc.) based on greater flexibility and new
   capabilities as described in [ITU-T_I.312_Q.1201].  For these IN
   services, ISUP introduced the "called IN number" and the "original
   called IN number" parameters to capture the information of the
   requested service access number prior its translation [ITU-T_Q.763].

   The term "service access number" is used in this specification to
   refer to the dialable number by which a specific service is reached.
   This special number is not a globally routable number and therefore



Mohali & Barnes          Expires August 4, 2017                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft    Cause for service number translation      January 2017


   needs to be translated into a routable SIP or tel URI to process the
   session establishment.

   This specification proposes a solution to allow the identification of
   well-known services such as premium or toll free services that
   perform service access number translation, and to enable interworking
   with SIP signaling with the ISUP Called IN number and Original Called
   IN numbers parameters.

   The mechanism will allow a SIP network to insert and convey the
   service access number requested prior its translation to the final
   destination.

   In order to provide full call forwarding or access number translation
   services, usage of the "cause" URI parameter is only relevant within
   the History-Info header field defined in [RFC7044].  Because this
   relation has not been described in [RFC4458], this document provides
   guidance for using the "cause" URI parameter in conjunction with the
   History-Info header field.

   This document also answers a need expressed by the 3rd-Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP) [TS.3GPP.24.229] to identify the service
   access number.  The procedures it defines are intended for networks
   that use 3GPP defined services.  Their use is undefined for other
   networks.

2.  Solution

   A new value for the "cause" URI parameter of the 'sip:' or 'sips:'
   URI schemes is defined for "Service number translation" use case.
   This value may be used in a 'sip:' or 'sips:' URI inserted in the
   Request-URI and in the History-Info header field [RFC7044] when the
   URI is issued from a retargeting or a service access number
   translation by a specific service similar to PSTN/ISDN IN services
   that is not a call forwarding service.

   As defined in [RFC4458], the cause URI parameter must be encoded in
   the new target URI when generated by the service.

   The ABNF grammar [RFC5234] for the cause-param and target-param
   parameters is summarized below as it has been subject to Errata [ID:
   1409] in [RFC4458].  The Status-Code is defined in [RFC3261].

   target-param = "target=" pvalue

   cause-param = "cause=" Status-Code

   The following value for this URI parameter is added to the existing
   ones:

                +---------------------------------+-------+
                |         Cause                   | Value |
                +---------------------------------+-------+
                | Service number translation      | 380   |
                +---------------------------------+-------+

3.  Guidelines

   In order to help implementation of this solution for conveyance of
   the service access number, this document proposes guidance for usage
   of the "cause" URI parameter: a guidance for the "cause" URI
   parameter usage in the request history information in section 3.1 and
   a guidance for processing a service number translation service using
   the new "cause" URI parameter value in section 3.2.

3.1.  Interaction with Request History Information

   The History-Info header field defined in [RFC7044] specifies a means
   of providing the UAS and UAC with information about the retargeting
   of a request.  This information includes the initial Request-URI and
   any retargeted URIs.  This information is placed in History-Info
   headers as the request is retargeted and, upon reaching the UAS, is
   returned in certain responses.  The History-Info header field enables
   many enhanced services by providing the information as to how and why
   a SIP request arrives at a specific application or user and to keep
   this information throughout the signaling path even when successive
   applications are involved.

   When a proxy inserts a URI containing the "cause" URI parameter
   defined in [RFC4458] into the Request-URI of a forwarded request, per
   [RFC7044], the proxy must also copy this new Request-URI within a
   History-Info header field entry into the forwarded request, and so
   the URI in that entry includes the "cause" URI parameter.  Therefore,
   even if the Request-URI is replaced as a result of rerouting by a
   downstream proxy, the History-Info header field will still contain
   these parameters, which can be of use to the UAS.  Note that if a
   proxy does not support generation of the History-Info header field or
   if a downstream proxy removes the History-Info header fields, an
   application will only have access to the "cause" URI parameter if the
   request is not subsequently retargeted (i.e., it will be contained
   only in the Request-URI in the incoming request).  The implications
   of the solution are further discussed in section Section 3.2.

   In order to be able to filter specific entries among the history
   information, header field parameters have been defined in [RFC7044].

Internet-Draft    Cause for service number translation      January 2017


   In particular, the "mp" and "rc" header field parameters having the
   following definitions: The "mp" header field parameter is added when
   the new target was determined based on a mapping to a user other than
   the target user associated with the Request-URI being retargeted.
   This allows identifying retargets that are the result of a decision
   made by a particular type of application or that an initial request
   has been retargeted as a result of an application decision in a
   general manner.  The "rc" header field parameter is added when the
   new target represents a change in Request-URI, while the target user
   remains the same.  These header field parameters can be used in
   conjunction with the new "cause" URI parameter for certain
   applications, an example of which is provided in section Section 4.

   When using the History-Info header field in conjunction with the
   "cause" URI parameter in a Request-URI, it is important to consider
   that the "cause" URI parameter is not the same parameter as the
   "cause" header field parameter included in the Reason header
   [RFC3326].  The "cause" header field parameter of the Reason header
   field should be added to a History-Info entry only when the
   retargeting is due to a received SIP response.

3.2.  Handling and Processing the Service Number Translation "cause" URI
      parameter value

   At the Application Server:

      When an application receiving a request that is addressed to a
      service access number changes the Request-URI into a routable
      number, it should insert within this new Request-URI a "cause" URI
      parameter value set to 380 "Service Number Translation".
      Following the process described in [RFC7044], the application
      server adds a new History-Info header field entry including the
      new Request-URI value including the "cause" URI parameter.  It is
      also possible for an application server to add a "target" URI
      parameter as defined in [RFC4458] with the initial value of the
      Request-URI received by the application server.

   Note that if the new Request-URI is further replaced by a downstream
   proxy for any reason and if the History-Info header field is not
   supported, the information of the service access number initially
   requested would be lost.  Thus, it is strongly recommended to support
   the History-Info header field all along the signaling path.

   At the UAS:

      When the UAS receiving the request wants to retrieve the service
      access number by which it has been reached, first it should look
      for the "cause" URI parameter value 380 in the History-Info header



Mohali & Barnes          Expires August 4, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Cause for service number translation      January 2017


      field.  This History-Info entry should also contain an "mp" or
      "rc" header field parameter and then the UAS can find the
      requested service number in the History-Info entry having an index
      parameter value that match this "mp" or "rc" header field
      parameter value.  If for any reason, there is no "mp" or "rc"
      header field parameter in the identified History-Info entry, the
      UAS can find the requested service number in the preceding
      History-Info entry.

   If the History-Info header is not supported or has been removed by a
   proxy for any reason, the UAS might be able to find the requested
   service access number before translation in either of the following
   ways, but there is no guarantee:

   o  If the UAS is the direct target of the request coming from the
      application, the UAS ought to be able to find the service access
      number in the "target" URI parameter of the Request-URI if there
      is also a "cause" URI parameter set to 380 in this Request-URI.

   o  If there is no "cause" URI parameter set to 380 in the Request-URI
      and there is no History-Info header field, the UAS will not be
      able to reliably retrieve the service access number before
      translation.  Some existing implementations are known to extract
      the number from the "To" header field.  While that approach may
      work in some situations, it will not work in the general case
      because the To header field value is sometimes changed by
      intermediaries, and such a change is not always detectable.

4.  Example

   In this section an example is provided to illustrate the application
   of the new cause-param value.

   In this example, Alice calls her bank customer care.  John is the
   person at the call center that answers the call.  John is in a call
   center that manages several toll-free services and he needs to know
   for which service Alice is calling to provide the appropriate welcome
   speech.

   F2 INVITE Toll-Free Service -> Atlanta.com

      The Toll-Free application receives the request and translates
      the service number into a routable number toward the call center.
      The Request-URI is changed and, in the new Request-URI, the
      "cause" URI parameter set to 380 is added. As there was no
      History-Info header field in the received request,
      the application creates a History-Info header with two entries:
      one for the received Request-URI and one for the new Request-URI.

   F3 INVITE Atlanta.com -> John

      The call center proxy routes the received request to John's
      IP address by changing the Request-URI. When changing the

5.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC4458] defines a "cause" parameter specified as having predefined
   values.  This document defines a new value for the "cause" parameter:
   380.

   This document requests IANA to modify the existing row for the
   "cause" parameter to add a reference to this document under the "SIP/
   SIPS URI Parameters" subregistry within the "Session Initiation
   Protocols" registry:

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4458] apply.

   A privacy service that performs the "Privacy: header" Service
   [RFC3323] must remove the cause URI parameter from the URI.  Privacy
   of the parameters, when they form part of a URI within the History-
   Info header field, is covered in [RFC7044].
