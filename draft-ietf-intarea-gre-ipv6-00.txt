          IPv6 Support for Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
                     draft-ietf-intarea-gre-ipv6-00

Abstract

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) can be used to carry any network
   layer protocol over any network layer protocol.  GRE procedures are
   specified for IPv4, used as either the payload or delivery protocol.
   However, GRE procedures are not specified for IPv6, used as either
   the payload or delivery protocol.

   This document specifies GRE procedures for IPv6, used as either the
   payload or delivery protocol, and updates RFC 2784, the original GRE
   specification.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784] [RFC2890] can be used
   to encapsulate and carry any network layer protocol (payload) over
   any network layer protocol (delivery).  GRE procedures are specified
   for IPv4 [RFC0791], used as either the payload or delivery protocol.
   However, GRE procedures are not specified for IPv6 [RFC2460], used as
   either the payload or delivery protocol.

   This document specifies GRE procedures for IPv6, used as either the
   payload or delivery protocol, and updates RFC 2784 [RFC2784].

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are specific to GRE and are modeled from
   [RFC2784]:

   o  GRE delivery header - an IPv4 or IPv6 header whose source address
      represents the GRE ingress node and whose destination address
      represents the GRE egress node.  The GRE delivery header
      encapsulates a GRE header.

   o  GRE header - the GRE protocol header.  The GRE header is
      encapsulated by the GRE delivery header and encapsulates GRE
      payload.

   o  GRE payload packet - a network layer packet that needs to be
      encapsulated and delivered to some destination, and is
      encapsulated by the GRE header.

   The following terms are specific MTU discovery:

   o  path MTU (PMTU) - the minimum MTU of all the links in a path
      between a source node and a destination node.  If the source and
      destination node are connected through equal cost multipath
      (ECMP), the PMTU is equal to the minimum link MTU of all links
      contributing to the multipath.

   o  Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) - A procedure for dynamically
      discovering the PMTU between two nodes on the Internet.  PMTUD
      procedures for IPv6 are defined in [RFC1981].

2.  GRE Header Fields

   This document does not change any other fields or behaviors of the
   GRE specification [RFC2784] [RFC2890].

2.1.  Checksum Present

   The Checksum Present field SHOULD be set to zero by senders if IPv6
   is used as a delivery protocol.  Receivers MUST also accept a value
   of one in this field and use it to calculate the GRE header length
   but they MUST NOT verify the contents of the Checksum field.

2.2.  Protocol Type

   The Protocol Type field contains the protocol type of the payload
   packet.  These Protocol Types are defined in [ETYPES].  An
   implementation receiving a packet containing a Protocol Type which is
   not listed in [ETYPES] SHOULD discard the packet.

3.  IPv6 as a GRE Payload

   When the GRE payload is IPv6, the Protocol Type field in the GRE
   header MUST be set to 0x86DD.

4.  IPv6 as a GRE Delivery Protocol

   When the GRE delivery protocol is IPv6, the GRE header can
   immediately follow the GRE delivery header.  Alternatively, IPv6
   extension headers MAY be inserted between the GRE delivery header and
   the GRE header.  However, the IPv6 Destination Options Header MUST
   NOT be inserted between the GRE delivery header and the GRE header.

   If the GRE header immediately follows the GRE delivery header, the
   Next Header field in the IPv6 header of the GRE delivery packet MUST
   be set to the value 47.  If extension headers are inserted between
   the GRE delivery header and the GRE header, the Next Header field in
   the last IPv6 extension header MUST be set to 47.

   Following guidance provided in Section 5 of [RFC2460], GRE ingress
   nodes SHOULD implement PMTUD, in order to discover and take advantage
   of PMTUs greater than the IPv6 required minimum (1280 octets).
   However, a GRE ingress node MAY simply restrict itself to sending
   packets no larger than 1280 octets, and omit implementation of PMTUD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document adds no additional security risks to GRE, beyond what
   is specified in [RFC2784].  It also does not provide any additional
   security for GRE.
