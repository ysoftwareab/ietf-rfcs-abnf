      BGP Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery
                 draft-dong-pce-discovery-proto-bgp-05

Abstract

   In networks where Path Computation Element (PCE) is used for
   centralized path computation, it is desirable for the Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs) to automatically discover a set of PCEs
   and select the suitable ones to establish the PCEP session.  RFC 5088
   and RFC 5089 define the PCE discovery mechanisms based on Interior
   Gateway Protocols (IGP).  This document describes several scenarios
   in which the IGP based PCE discovery mechanisms cannot be used
   directly.  In such scenarios, BGP might be suitable, thus this
   document specifies the BGP extensions for PCE discovery.  The BGP
   based PCE discovery mechanism is complementary to the existing IGP
   based mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   In network scenarios where Path Computation Element (PCE) is used for
   centralized path computation, it is desirable for the Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs) to automatically discover a set of PCEs
   and select the suitable ones to establish the PCEP session.
   [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] define the PCE discovery mechanisms based on
   Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP).

   The IGP based discovery mechanism requires the PCE participate in the
   IGP network, which usually requires that the PCE is directly adjacent
   to at least one of the IGP routers in the network.  In some scenarios

Internet-Draft      BGP Extensions for PCE Discovery           June 2016


   such requirement cannot be satisfied.  For example, a PCE may need to
   provide path computation service to some subsidiary networks of an
   operator, which typically locate in different geographical region
   (and not IGP adjacent).  Also when PCE function is implemented in a
   central server running IGP on individual interfaces to each IGP area
   can be cumbersome.

   The requirement on PCE discovery, as described in [RFC4674], also
   include the automatic discovery of the PCEs in other domains, as it
   is a desirable function in the case of inter-domain path computation.
   The IGP based discovery mechanisms cannot meet such requirement.

   For example, Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] can
   be used by cooperating PCEs to compute an inter-AS path, in which
   case these cooperating PCEs should be known to each other in advance.
   In this case the PCEs belongs to different AS and do not participate
   in a common IGP, the IGP based discovery mechanisms are not
   applicable.

   Another example is the hierarchical PCE scenario [RFC6805], in which
   the child PCEs need to know the information of the parent PCEs.  This
   cannot be achieved via IGP based discovery, as the child PCEs and the
   parent PCE are usually in different domains.

   In some BGP IP-VPN networks, an end-to-end TE LSP between the CEs
   (Customer Edges) of a particular VPN is required [RFC5824].  In this
   case, CEs need the information of the PCE which can perform the CE to
   CE path computation for that VPN.  Since the PCE may locate in a VPN
   site different from the site of the requesting CE, the IGP based
   discovery mechanism is not directly applicable, and some BGP based
   discovery mechanism is required to distribute the per-VPN PCE
   information to the VPN sites.

   Since BGP has been extended for north-bound distribution of routing
   and Label Switched Path (LSP) information to PCE [RFC7752]
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] and [I-D.ietf-idr-te-pm-bgp], PCEs
   can obtain the routing information without participating in IGP.  In
   this scenario, a new BGP based PCE discovery mechanism is needed.

   This document proposes to extend BGP for PCE discovery in the above
   scenarios.  In networks where BGP-LS is used for the north-bound
   routing information distribution to PCE, the BGP based PCE discovery
   can make use of the existing BGP sessions and mechanisms to achieve
   automatic PCE discovery.  Further IGP may be used to redistribute
   remote PCE information, the detailed mechanism is out of the scope of
   this document.  Thus the BGP based PCE discovery is complementary to
   the existing IGP based mechanisms.

                      Figure 1: BGP for PCE discovery

   As shown in the network architecture in Figure 1, BGP is used both
   for routing information distribution and for PCE information
   discovery.  The routing information is collected from the network
   elements and distributed to PCE, while the PCE discovery information
   is advertised from PCE to PCCs, or among different PCEs.  The PCCs
   maybe co-located with the BGP speakers as shown in Figure 1.

2.  Carrying PCE Discovery Information in BGP

2.1.  PCE Address Information

   The PCE discovery information is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages
   using the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760].
   The AFI and SAFI defined in [RFC7752] are re-used.  For the PCEs in
   public network, the AFI / SAFI pair is 16388 / 71, while for the PCEs
   of a particular VPN, the AFI / SAFI pair is set to 16388 / 72.

   A new NLRI Type is defined for PCE discovery information as below:

   o  Type = TBD: PCE Discovery NLRI

   The format of PCE Discovery NLRI is shown in the following figure:

   The 'Protocol-ID' field SHOULD be set to the appropriate value which
   indicates the source of the PCE discovery information.  If BGP
   speaker and PCE are co-located, the Protocol-ID SHOULD be set to
   "Direct".  In other cases, it is RECOMMENDED that the Protocol-ID
   value be set to "Static configuration".

   As defined in [RFC7752], the 64-Bit 'Identifier' field is used to
   identify the "routing universe" where the PCE belongs.

2.2.  PCE Discovery TLVs

   The detailed PCE discovery information is carried in the BGP-LS
   attribute [RFC7752] with a new "PCE Discovery TLV", which contains a
   set of sub-TLVs for specific PCE discovery information.  The PCE
   Discovery TLV and sub-TLVs SHOULD only be used with the PCE Discovery
   NLRI.

   The format of the PCE Discovery TLV is shown as below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   The PCE Discovery sub-TLVs are listed as below.  The format of the
   PCE Discovery sub-TLVs are consistent with the IGP PCED sub-TLVs as
   defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].  The PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV MUST
   always be carried in the PCE Discovery TLV.  Other PCE Discovery sub-

   TLVs are optional and may facilitate the PCE selection process on the
   PCCs.

     Type |  Length    |      Name
    ------+------------+--------------------------------
     1    |     3      |  PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV
     2    |  variable  |  PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV
     3    |  variable  |  OSPF-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     4    |  variable  |  IS-IS-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     5    |  variable  |  OSPF-NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     6    |  variable  |  IS-IS-NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV


   More PCE Discovery sub-TLVs may be defined in future.  The format and
   semantic of new PCE Discovery sub-TLVs SHOULD be consistent in BGP
   and IGP based PCE discovery.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Existing BGP operational procedures apply to the advertisement of PCE
   discovery information.  This information is treated as pure
   application level data which has no immediate impact on forwarding
   states.  Normal BGP path selection can be applied to PCE Discovery
   NLRI only for the information propagation in the network, while on
   PCCs the PCE selection is based on the information carried in the PCE
   Discovery TLV.  The PCE discovery information SHOULD be advertised
   only to the domains where such information is allowed to be used.
   This can be achieved by policy control on the ASBRs.

   The PCE discovery information is considered relatively stable and
   does not change frequently, thus this information will not bring
   significant impact on the amount of BGP updates in the network.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign a new NLRI Type for 'PCE Discovery NLRI' from
   the "BGP-LS NLRI-Types" registry.

   IANA needs to assign a new TLV code point for 'PCE Discovery TLV'
   from the "node anchor, link descriptor and link attribute TLVs"
   registry.

   IANA needs to create a new registry for "PCE Discovery Sub-TLVs".
   The registry will be initialized as shown in section 2.2 of this
   document.
