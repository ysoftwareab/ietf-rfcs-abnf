                     The IMAP APPENDLIMIT Extension

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the IMAP service whereby a
   server can inform the client about maximum message upload sizes,
   allowing the client to avoid sending APPEND commands that will fail
   because the messages are too large.

1.  Introduction

   Some IMAP servers have limits for message upload size, and those
   limits are not published to the email client.  When the email client
   APPENDs a message with huge attachments, using non-synchronizing
   literals, the APPEND fails because of the upload limit, but the
   client has already sent the message data anyway.  This results in
   unnecessary resource usage.  Especially in the mobile device
   environment, appending a message with huge attachments consumes
   device resources like device battery power and mobile data.

   The IMAP APPENDLIMIT extension provides the ability to advertise a
   maximum upload size allowed by the IMAP server, so that the email
   client knows the size limitation beforehand.  By implementing this
   extension, IMAP server-side processing of huge attachments above the
   maximum upload size can be avoided.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, &quot;C:&quot; and &quot;S:&quot; indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single &quot;C:&quot; or &quot;S:&quot; label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

2.  APPENDLIMIT Extension

   An IMAP server that supports the APPENDLIMIT extension advertises
   this by including the name APPENDLIMIT in its capability list in the
   authenticated state.  The server may also advertise this extension
   before the user has logged in.  If this capability is omitted, no
   information is conveyed about the server&#x27;s fixed maximum size for
   mail uploads.  An IMAP server can publish the APPENDLIMIT capability
   in two formats.

   (a) APPENDLIMIT=&lt;number&gt;

   This indicates that the IMAP server has the same upload limit for all
   mailboxes.  The following example demonstrates the APPENDLIMIT
   capability with the same upload limit for all mailboxes.

   C: t1 CAPABILITY
   S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID APPENDLIMIT=257890
   S: t1 OK foo

   (b) APPENDLIMIT

   The APPENDLIMIT capability without any value indicates that the IMAP
   server supports this extension, and that the client will need to
   discover upload limits for each mailbox, as they might differ from
   mailbox to mailbox.  The following example demonstrates the
   APPENDLIMIT capability without any value.

   C: t1 CAPABILITY
   S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID APPENDLIMIT
   S: t1 OK foo

   In this case, the client can get an APPENDLIMIT value by either
   issuing a STATUS or a LIST command.

   An IMAP client implementing this extension should be able to parse
   both mailbox-specific and global APPENDLIMIT responses.  By looking
   at the upload size advertised by the IMAP server, a client can avoid
   trying to APPEND mail more than the advertised limit.

3.  Mailbox-Specific APPENDLIMIT

   An IMAP server can have mailbox-specific APPENDLIMIT values that will
   not be advertised as part of the CAPABILITY response.  The IMAP
   server can publish specific values for each mailbox, and it can
   publish &quot;NIL&quot; for a mailbox to convey that there is no APPENDLIMIT
   for that mailbox.  The following subsections describe the changes to
   the STATUS and LIST commands in support of this situation.

3.1.  STATUS Response to the STATUS Command

   A new attribute APPENDLIMIT is added to get the limit set by the
   server for a mailbox as part of a STATUS command.  An IMAP client
   should issue a STATUS command with an APPENDLIMIT item to get the
   mailbox-specific upload value.  The following example demonstrates
   its usage.

   C: t1 STATUS INBOX (APPENDLIMIT)
   S: * STATUS INBOX (APPENDLIMIT 257890)
   S: t1 OK STATUS completed

   In the above example, APPENDLIMIT represents the maximum upload size
   for INBOX.

3.2.  STATUS Response to the LIST Command

   If the server advertises the LIST-STATUS capability [RFC5819], the
   client can issue a LIST command in combination with the STATUS return
   option to get the mailbox-specific upload value.  The following
   example demonstrates its usage.

   <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-5726'>   C: t1 LIST &quot;&quot; % RETURN (STATUS (APPENDLIMIT)) <button id="btn_5726" target="expand_5726" onclick='hideFunction("expand_5726")'>Expand</button>
   S: * LIST () &quot;.&quot; &quot;INBOX&quot;
   S: * STATUS &quot;INBOX&quot; (APPENDLIMIT 257890)
   S: t1 OK List completed.</span id__locate=5726>
<div class="nodeCloseClass" id='expand_5726'><div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid5726'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5726'>EID 5726</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 3.2

<b>Original Text:</b>

   C: t1 LIST &quot;&quot; % RETURN (STATUS (APPENDLIMIT))
   S: * LIST () &quot;.&quot;  &quot;INBOX&quot;
   S: * STATUS &quot;INBOX&quot; (APPENDLIMIT 257890)
   S: t1 OK List completed.

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

   C: t1 LIST &quot;&quot; % RETURN (STATUS (APPENDLIMIT))
   S: * LIST () &quot;.&quot; &quot;INBOX&quot;
   S: * STATUS &quot;INBOX&quot; (APPENDLIMIT 257890)
   S: t1 OK List completed.
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
Line 198 contains two spaces between &quot;&quot;.&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;INBOX&quot;&quot; instead of one.  While I had the instinct to mark this as editorial, this sample server response, whose genesis appears to be RFC 5819, ended up in two IDs (which were corrected before they became RFCs) as well.  In any event, given that this response also violates the ABNF, and given the RFC Ed.&#x27;s guideline on ambiguity, I&#x27;m just marking it as technical.  I&#x27;ll leave it to others more familiar with the practical issues for various implementers to make the final determination on how to label it.<br/><br/>----- Verifier notes -----<br/>Yes, this is an error: it comes from a combination of the RFC Editor style of double-spacing between sentences, the construction of the examples in XML in a manner that doesn&#x27;t distinguish them from sentences, and the fact that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to notice the situation when one is giving a final review.<br/><br/>Editorial, though, because it&#x27;s in examples.  The ABNF is the authoritative place, and that&#x27;s correct.
</div>
</div>
   The IMAP server MUST recognize the APPENDLIMIT attribute and include
   an appropriate STATUS response for each matching mailbox.  Refer to
   Section 5 for the syntax.

   If the server does not support the STATUS return option on the LIST
   command, then the client should use the STATUS command instead.

3.3.  APPENDLIMIT Behavior

   Computing the APPENDLIMIT should be fast and should not take Access
   Control Lists (ACLs), quotas, or other such information into account.
   The APPENDLIMIT specifies one part of the policy, but an APPEND
   command can still fail due to issues related to ACLs and quotas, even
   if the message being appended is smaller than the APPENDLIMIT.

4.  APPEND Response

   If a client uploads a message that exceeds the maximum upload size
   set for that mailbox, then the server SHALL reject the APPEND command
   with a tagged TOOBIG response code.  Refer to Section 4 of [RFC4469]
   for various APPEND response codes and their handling.

   A client SHOULD avoid use of non-synchronizing literals [RFC7888]
   when the maximum upload size supported by the IMAP server is unknown.
   Refer to Section 4.2.2.3 of [RFC4549] for usage of non-synchronizing
   literals and its risk for disconnected IMAP clients.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234] including the core
   rules in Appendix B.1 of that document.  [RFC3501] defines the non-
   terminals &quot;capability&quot; and &quot;status-att&quot;, and [RFC4466] defines
   &quot;status-att-val&quot;.

   All alphabetic characters are case insensitive.  The use of uppercase
   or lowercase characters to define token strings is for editorial
   clarity only.  Implementations MUST accept these strings in a case-
   insensitive fashion.

   capability =/ &quot;APPENDLIMIT&quot; [&quot;=&quot; number]
               ;; capability is defined in RFC 3501

   status-att =/ &quot;APPENDLIMIT&quot;
               ;; status-att is defined in RFC 3501

   status-att-val =/ &quot;APPENDLIMIT&quot; SP (number / nil)
                   ;; status-att-val is defined in RFC 4466


   The number indicates the fixed maximum message size in octets that
   the server will accept.  An APPENDLIMIT number of 0 indicates the
   server will not accept any APPEND commands at all for the affected
   mailboxes.

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension provides additional information that cooperative
   clients can use as an optimization and does not introduce new
   security concerns.  This extension does not address abusive clients
   that intend to consume server resources, and servers will still have
   to take action to disconnect and/or restrict access to clients that
   exhibit abusive behavior.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added &quot;APPENDLIMIT&quot; to the &quot;IMAP Capabilities&quot; registry,
   using this document as its reference.
