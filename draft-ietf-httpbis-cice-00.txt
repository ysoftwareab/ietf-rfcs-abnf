  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Client-Initiated Content-Encoding
                       draft-ietf-httpbis-cice-00

Abstract

   In HTTP, "Content Codings" allow for payload encodings such as for
   compression or integrity checks.  In particular, the "gzip" content
   coding is widely used for payload data sent in response messages.

   Content Codings can be used in request messages as well, however
   discoverability is not on par with response messages.  This document
   extends the HTTP "Accept-Encoding" header field for use in responses.

Internet-Draft                  HTTP CICE                     April 2015


1.  Introduction

   In HTTP, "Content Codings" allow for payload encodings such as for
   compression or integrity checks ([RFC7231], Section 3.1.2).  In
   particular, the "gzip" content coding is widely used for payload data
   sent in response messages.

   Content Codings can be used in request messages as well, however
   discoverability is not on par with response messages.  This document
   extends the HTTP "Accept-Encoding" header field ([RFC7231], Section
   5.3.4) for use in responses.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terminology used in the base HTTP
   specifications, namely Section 2 of [RFC7230] and Section 3.1.2 of
   [RFC7231].

3.  Extensions to 'Accept-Encoding' Header Field

   Section 5.3.4 of [RFC7231] defines "Accept-Encoding" as a request
   header field only.

   This specification extends that definition to allow "Accept-Encoding"
   as a response header field as well.  When present, it indicates what
   content codings a resource was willing to accept at the time of the
   response.  A field value that only contains "identity" implies that
   no content codings are supported.

   Note that this information is specific to the specific request.  The
   set of supported encodings might be different for other resources on
   the same server, could also change depending on other aspects of the
   request (such as the request method), or might change in the future.

   Section 6.5.13 of [RFC7231] defines status code 415 (Unsupported
   Media Type) to apply to both media type and content coding related
   problems.

   Servers that fail a request due to an unsupported content coding
   SHOULD respond with a 415 status and SHOULD include an "Accept-
   Encoding" header field in that response, allowing clients to
   distinguish between content coding related issues and media type
   related issues.  In order to avoid confusion with media type related
   problems, servers that fail a request with a 415 status for reasons

Internet-Draft                  HTTP CICE                     April 2015


   unrelated to content codings SHOULD NOT include the "Accept-Encoding"
   header field.

   While sending "Accept-Encoding" in a 415 (Unsupported Media Type)
   response will be the most common use case, it is not restricted to
   this particular status code.  For instance, a server might include it
   in a 2xx response when a request payload was big enough to justify
   use of a compression coding, but the client failed to do so.

4.  Example

   Client submits a POST request using Content-Encoding "compress"
   ([RFC7231], Section 3.1.2.1):

     POST /edit/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry
     Content-Encoding: compress

     ...compressed payload...

   Server rejects request because it only allows the "gzip" content
   coding:

     HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
     Date: Fri, 09 May 2014 11:43:53 GMT
     Accept-Encoding: gzip
     Content-Length: 68
     Content-Type: text/plain

     This resource only supports the "gzip" content coding in requests.

   ...at which point the client can retry the request with the supported
   "gzip" content coding.

   Alternatively, a server that does not support any content codings in
   requests could answer with:

     HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
     Date: Fri, 09 May 2014 11:43:53 GMT
     Accept-Encoding: identity
     Content-Length: 61
     Content-Type: text/plain

     This resource does not support content codings in requests.

5.  Deployment Considerations

   Servers that do not support content codings in requests already are
   required to fail a request that does use a content coding.  Section
   6.5.13 of [RFC7231] recommends to use the status code 415
   (Unsupported Media Type), so the only change needed is to include the
   "Accept-Encoding" header field with value "identity" in that
   response.

   Servers that do support some content codings are required to fail
   requests with unsupported content codings as well.  To be compliant
   with this specification, servers will need to use the status code 415
   (Unsupported Media Type) to signal the problem, and will have to
   include an "Accept-Encoding" header field that enumerates the content
   codings that are supported.  As the set of supported content codings
   usually is static and small, adding the header field ought to be
   trivial.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond those discussed in Section 9 of [RFC7231].

7.  IANA Considerations

   HTTP header fields are registered within the "Message Headers"
   registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers>, as defined by
   [BCP90].

   This document updates the definition of the "Accept-Encoding" header
   field, so the "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry shall
   be updated accordingly:

   +-----------------+----------+----------+---------------------------+
   | Header Field    | Protocol | Status   | Reference                 |
   | Name            |          |          |                           |
   +-----------------+----------+----------+---------------------------+
   | Accept-Encoding | http     | standard | [RFC7231], Section 5.3.4, |
   |                 |          |          | extended by Section 3 of  |
   |                 |          |          | this document             |
   +-----------------+----------+----------+---------------------------+

Appendix A.  Change Log (to be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

A.1.  Since draft-reschke-http-cice-00

   Clarified that the information returned in Accept-Encoding is per
   resource, not per server.

   Added some deployment considerations.

   Updated HTTP/1.1 references.

A.2.  Since draft-reschke-http-cice-01

   Restrict the scope of A-E from "future requests" to "at the time of
   this request".

   Mention use of A-E in responses other than 415.

   Recommend not to include A-E in a 415 response unless there was
   actually a problem related to content coding.

A.3.  Since draft-reschke-http-cice-02

   First Working Group draft; updated boilerplate accordingly.
