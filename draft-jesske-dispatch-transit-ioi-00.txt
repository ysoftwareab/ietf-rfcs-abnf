3.  Overview

   In [RFC3455] The P-Charging-Vector Header is defined.  This header is
   used to correlate the charging records generated from diffrent
   entitis on the path of the call.  The normal 3GPP used case covered
   by this header is a normal call that is originated and terminated
   within the own network and where originating and an terminating
   network is diffrent either in roaming cases or interconnection.  So
   the billing and charging matters are normally handled between maximum
   two networks.

   But there are also fixed line carries using the IMS for their
   purposes.  The IMS is the replacement for the PSTN/ISND networks from
   these operators.  The buissenes modells are more complex within a
   multi operator environment.  There are local operators that have not
   the interconnectivity with all operators, therefore transitcarriers
   are needed.

   In such cases the billing/charging process is spread over 3 Carriers
   and more carriers.  For such scenarios the knowledge of the transit
   carrier is needed and should be also stated within the P-Charging-
   Vetor Header.

4.  Requirements

   REQ-1:

   A mechanism is needed to identify the transit carrier within the
   Charging record.


5.  Overall Applicability Statement of the transit-ioi

   The IOI identifies both the originating and terminating networks
   involved in a SIP dialog or transaction outside a dialog.  There may
   an IOI generated from each side of the dialog to identify the network
   associated with each side.  This document adds the transit ioi
   identifier.

   The transit-ioi is added from the egress SIP proxy, sending the
   initial request containing a P-Charging-Vector Header.

   As described in [RFC3455] the P-Charging-Vector header is applicable
   within a single private administrative domain or between different
   administrative domains where there is a trust relationship between
   the domains.  The P-Charging-Vector header is not included in a SIP
   message sent to another network if there is no trust relationship.


6.  Example

   We present example in the context of the scenario presented in the
   following network diagram:

   Scenario UA1 --- P1 --- P2 --- P3--- UA2

   This example shows the message sequence for an INVITE transaction
   originating from UA1 eventually arriving at UA2.  P1 is an outbound
   proxy for UA1.  In this case P1 also inserts charging information.
   P1 then routes the call to P2 due to existing interconnection
   possibilities.  P2 routs the call to P3 and P3 terminates the call at

7.  Syntax definition for transit-ioi

   The Syntax of the P-Charging-Vector header syntax as defined within
   [RFC3455] shall be exteded with the transit-ioi value.

   transit-ioi = "transit-ioi" EQUAL gen-value

   The transit-ioi parameters represent, respectively, the transit
   interoperator identifier.  It is used to correlate charging records
   between different operators.  The transit ioi represents the network
   responsible for the records in the transit part of the session or
   standalone request.


8.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as described within RFC3455 apply.


9.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of "transit-ioi" parameter for SIP P-Charging-Vector
   header.
