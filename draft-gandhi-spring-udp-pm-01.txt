                          UDP Path for In-band 
          Performance Measurement for Segment Routing Networks
                     draft-gandhi-spring-udp-pm-01

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document
   specifies a procedure for using UDP path for sending and processing
   in-band probe query and response messages for Performance Measurement
   (PM).  The procedure uses the RFC 6374 defined mechanisms for Delay
   and Loss performance measurement.  The procedure specified is
   applicable to IPv4, IPv6, SR-MPLS, and SRv6 data planes for both
   links and end-to-end measurement for SR Policies.  This document also
   defines mechanisms for handling Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) for SR
   Policies.  In addition, this document defines new Return Path Segment
   List TLV for two-way performance measurement.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) technology greatly simplifies network operations
   for Software Defined Networks (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. 
   SR takes advantage of the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between
   source, transit and destination nodes.  SR Policies as defined in
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to steer traffic through
   a specific, user-defined path using a stack of Segments.  Built-in SR
   Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the essential requirements to
   provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks.  These protocols rely on control channel
   signaling to establish a connection over an UDP path to bootstrap PM
   sessions, and they are not compatible with the mechanisms defined in
   [RFC6374].  These protocols lack support for IEEE 1588 timestamps
   [IEEE1588] and direct-mode LM, which are required in Segment Routing
   networks [RFC6374]. 

   [RFC6374] specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of performance metrics and can be used in SR
   networks with MPLS data plane [I-D.spring-sr-mpls-pm].  [RFC6374]
   addresses the limitations of the IP based performance measurement
   protocols.  However, [RFC6374] requires data plane to support MPLS
   Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) and Generic Associated Channel
   (G-Ach), which may not be supported on all nodes in the network.  

   [RFC7876] specifies the procedures to be used when sending and
   processing out-of-band performance measurement probe response
   messages over an UDP return path for RFC 6374 based probe queries. 
   [RFC7876] can be used to send out-of-band PM probe responses in both
   SR-MPLS and SRv6 networks for one-way performance measurement.

   For SR Policies, there is a need to measure the performance of all
   end-to-end forwarding paths due to presence of ECMPs between the
   source and transit nodes, between transit nodes and between transit
   and destination nodes.  Existing PM protocols (e.g. OWAMP, TWAMP, RFC

   6374, etc.) do not define handling for ECMP forwarding paths in SR
   networks.

   For two-way measurements for SR Policies, there is a need to specify
   a return path in the form of a Segment List in PM probe query
   messages without requiring any SR Policy state on the destination
   node.  Exiting protocols do not have such mechanisms to specify
   return path in the PM probe query messages.

   This document specifies a procedure for using UDP path for sending
   and processing in-band probe query and response messages for
   Performance Measurement that does not require to bootstrap PM
   sessions.  The procedure uses RFC 6374 defined mechanisms for Delay
   and Loss PM and unless otherwise specified, the procedures from RFC
   6374 are not modified.  The procedure specified is applicable to
   IPv4, IPv6, SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.  The procedure does not
   require to bootstrap PM sessions and can be used for both SR links
   and end-to-end measurement for SR Policies.  This document also
   defines mechanisms for handling Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) for SR
   Policies.  In addition, this document defines Return Path Segment
   List TLV for two-way performance measurement.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology, the querier node R1 initiates a probe
   query for performance measurement and the responder node R5 sends a
   probe response for the query message received.  The probe response
   may be sent to the querier node R1 or to a controller node R100.  The
   nodes R1 and R5 may be directly connected via a link enabled with
   Segment Routing or there exists an SR Policy
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] on node R1 with destination to
   node R5.

   and two-way delay measurements are defined in Section 2.4 of
   [RFC6374].  Transmit and Receive packet loss measurements are defined
   in Section 2.2 of [RFC6374].  One-way loss measurement provides
   receive packet loss whereas two-way loss measurement provides both
   transmit and receive packet loss.


3.  Probe Messages

3.1.  Probe Query Message

   In this document, UDP path is defined for sending and processing PM
   probe query messages for Delay and Loss measurements for SR links and
   end-to-end SR Policies as described in the following Sections.  As
   well-known UDP port is used for identifying PM probe packets,
   bootstrapping of the PM session [RFC5357] is not required.

3.1.1.  Delay Measurement Probe Query Message

   The message content for Delay Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC768] is shown in Figure 1.  As shown, the DM probe
   query message is sent with Destination UDP port number TBA1 defined
   in this document.  The Source UDP port may optionally be set to TBA1
   for two-way delay measurement.  The DM probe query message contains
   the payload for delay measurement defined in Section 3.2 of
   [RFC6374].

   performance measurement of an SRv6 Policy is sent using SRv6 Segment
   Routing Header (SRH) and Segment List as defined in
   [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header] and is shown in Figure 4.

   When the received probe query message does not contain any UDP Return
   Object (URO) TLV [RFC7876], the probe response message uses the
   IP/UDP information from the probe query message.  The content of the
   probe response message is shown in Figure 5.

   Figure 6: Probe Response Message Using URO from Probe Query Message

3.2.1.  One-way Measurement for SR Link and end-to-end SR Policy

   For one-way performance measurement, the probe response message as
   defined in Figure 5 or Figure 6 is sent out-of-band for both SR links
   and SR Policies.

   The PM querier node can receive probe response message back by
   properly setting its own IP address as Source Address of the header
   or by adding URO TLV in the probe query message and setting its own
   IP address in the IP Address in the URO TLV (Type=131) [RFC7876].

3.2.1.1.  Probe Response Message to Controller

   As shown in Reference Topology, if the querier node requires the
   probe response message to be sent to the controller R100, it adds URO
   TLV in the probe query message and sets the IP address of R100 in the
   IP Address field and UDP port TBA1 for DM and TBA2 for LM in the UDP-
   Destination-Port field of the URO TLV (Type=131) [RFC7876].

3.2.2.  Two-way Measurement for SR Links

   For two-way performance measurement, when using a bidirectional
   channel, the probe response message as defined in Figure 5 or Figure
   6 is sent back in-band to the querier node for SR links.  In this
   case, the "control code" in the probe query message is set to
   "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].

3.2.3.  Two-way End-to-end Measurement of SR Policy

   For two-way performance measurement, when using a bidirectional
   channel, the probe response message is sent back in-band to the
   querier node for end-to-end measurement of SR Policies.  In this
   case, the "control code" in the probe query message is set to
   "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].

3.2.3.1.  Return Path Segment List TLV

   For two-way performance measurement, the responder node needs to send
   the probe response message in-band on a specific reverse SR path. 
   This way the destination node does not require any additional SR
   Policy state.  The querier node can request in the probe query
   message to the responder node to send a response back on a given
   reverse path (typically co-routed path for two-way measurement).  

   [RFC6374] defines DM and LM probe query messages that can include one
   or more optional TLVs.  New TLV Types are defined in this document

                 Figure 7: Return Path Segment List TLV

   All Segments in Segment List can be one of following Types:

   o  RPSL Type (value TBA3) carrying SR-MPLS Labels

   o  RPSL Type (value TBA4) carrying SRv6 Segments

   o  RPSL Type (value TBA5) carrying SR-MPLS Binding SID
      [I-D.pce-binding-label-sid] of the Reverse SR Policy  

   o  RPSL Type (value TBA6) carrying SRv6 Binding SID of the Reverse SR
      Policy

   The Segment List(0) can be used by the responder node to compute the
   next-hop IP address and outgoing interface to send the probe response
   messages.

   The RPSL TLV is optional.  The PM querier node MUST only insert one
   RPSL TLV in the probe query message and the responder node MUST only
   process the first RPSL TLV in the probe query message and ignore
   other RPSL TLVs if present.  The responder node MUST send probe
   response message back on the reverse path specified in the RPSL TLV
   and MUST NOT add RPSL TLV in the probe response message.

3.3.  ECMP Support

   An SR Policy can have a number of end-to-end forwarding paths due to
 


Gandhi, et al.         Expires December 11, 2018               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    UDP Path for PM for Segment Routing       June 9, 2018


   presence of Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between the source and
   transit nodes, between transit nodes and between transit and
   destination nodes.  The PM probe messages can be sent to traverse
   different ECMP forwarding paths and measure performance of all
   end-to-end forwarding paths of an SR Policy.  

   Forwarding planes have various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  Following mechanisms can be used in
   PM probe messages to take advantage of the hashing function in
   forwarding plane to influence the ECMP path taken by them.

   o  For IPv4 and SR-MPLS, the mechanisms described in [RFC8029] for
      handling ECMPs are also applicable to the performance measurement.
       For IPv4 and SR-MPLS, in IP/UDP header of the PM probe messages,
      different Destination Addresses in the range of 127/8 [RFC8029] or
      different Source Addresses or different Source UDP ports, etc. can
      be used.

   o  For SR-MPLS, entropy label [RFC6790] in the PM probe messages can
      be used.

   o  For IPv6, as specified in [RFC6437], 3-tuple of Flow Label, Source
      Address and Destination Address fields in the IPv6 header of the
      PM probe messages can be used.

   o  For SRv6, Flow Label in SRH [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header] of
      the PM probe messages can be used.


3.4.  Sequence Number TLV

   The message formats for DM and LM [RFC6374] do not contain sequence
   number for probe query packets.  Sequence numbers can be useful when
   some probe query messages are lost or they arrive out of order.

   [RFC6374] defines DM and LM probe query and response messages that
   can include one or more optional TLVs.  New TLV Type (value TBA7) is
   defined in this document to carry sequence number for probe query and
   response messages.  The format of the Sequence Number TLV is shown in
   Figure 10:

    0                   1                   2                   3

                    Figure 10: Sequence Number TLV

   The Sequence Number TLV is optional.  The PM querier node SHOULD only
   insert one Sequence Number TLV in the probe query message and the
   responder node in the probe response message SHOULD return the first
   Sequence Number TLV from the probe query messages and ignore other
   Sequence Number TLVs if present.


4.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in
   well-managed private and service provider networks.  The security
   considerations described in Section 8 of [RFC6374] are applicable to
   this specification, and particular attention should be paid to the
   last two paragraphs.  Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the
   correct configuration of access-control lists and firewalls.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate following UDP ports for performance
   measurements:

      o  UDP Port TBA1: Delay Performance Measurement

      o  UDP Port TBA2: Loss Performance Measurement

   IANA is also requested to allocate values for the following Return
   Path Segment List TLV Types for RFC 6374 to be carried in PM probe
   query messages:

      o  Type TBA3: SR-MPLS Segment List of the Reverse SR Policy

      o  Type TBA4: SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Policy

      o  Type TBA5: SR-MPLS Binding SID of the Reverse SR Policy

      o  Type TBA6: SRv6 Binding SID of the Reverse SR Policy

   IANA is also requested to allocate a value for the following Sequence
   Number TLV Type for RFC 6374 to be carried in PM probe query and
   response messages:

      o  Type TBA7: Sequence Number TLV
