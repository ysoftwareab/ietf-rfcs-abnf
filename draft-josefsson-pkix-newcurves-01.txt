Internet-Draft             PKIX OIDs for EdDSA              October 2015


1.  Introduction

   In [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves], the elliptic curves Curve25519 and
   Curve448 are described.  They are designed with performance and
   security in mind.  The curves may be used for Diffie-Hellman and
   Digital Signature operations.

   This RFC define ASN.1 "named curve" object identifiers for Curve25519
   and Curve448, for use in the Internet X.509 PKI [RFC5280].

   Rather than defining a new subject public key format for these two
   curves, this document re-use the existing ECDSA/ECDH public-key
   contained (described in section 2.3.5 of [RFC3279]) and introduce two
   new "named curve" OIDs.  This approach is the same as for the
   Brainpool curves [RFC5639].

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Curve25519 and Curve448 Named Curve Identifier

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] may convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  This algorithm identifier is an OID
   and optionally associated parameters.  Section 2.3.5 of [RFC3279]
   describe ECDSA/ECDH public keys, specifying the id-ecPublicKey OID.
   This OID has the associated EcpkParameters parameters structure,
   which contains the namedCurve CHOICE.  Here we introduce two new OIDs
   for use in the namedCurve field.

       id-Curve25519   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.15.1 }
       id-Curve448     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.15.2 }
       id-Curve25519ph OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.15.3 }
       id-Curve448ph   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.15.4 }

   The OID id-Curve25519 refers to Curve25519.  The OID id-Curve448
   refers to Curve448.  Both curves are described in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].  The OIDs id-Curve25519ph and id-Curve448ph
   refers to Curve25519 and Curve448 when used with pre-hashing as
   Ed25519ph and Ed448ph described in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

   The public key value encoded into the ECPoint value is the raw binary
   values described in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

4.  Acknowledgements

   Text and/or inspiration were drawn from [RFC5280], [RFC3279],
   [RFC5480], and [RFC5639].

   Several people suggested the utility of specifying OIDs for encoding
   Curve25519/Curve448 public keys into PKIX certificates, the editor of
   this document cannot take credit for this idea.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC5280], [RFC5480] and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves] apply accordingly.
