1. Introduction 

   There are various telecommunications applications that can 
   potentially be supported by methods of timing distribution. Timing 
   distribution includes frequency, phase and time synchronization. In 
   this document we only consider phase or time synchronization 
   (they may need frequency synchronization also). 

   To allow IEEE-1588 to satisfy the need(s) of the applications 
   requiring timing, it is necessary to ensure that all IEEE-1588
   capable devices have the features and performance to support the 
   applications at the appropriate level.  That is, the timing 
   distribution method must be fit-for-purpose. It's necessary to define 
   a telecom profile immediately. 

   Some of the considerations in developing the profile are described 
   below include: 

      -- Requirement 

      -- Interface 

      -- Modeling 

      -- TOD Distribution 

2. Requirement 

   Various of applications in telecom need different kinds of 
   synchronization. At first, it's important to provide some explanatory 
   information about it. Of course the profile and solution should suit 
   them. ITU-T Recommendation G.8261/Y.1362 summarizes some of it. 

               2.1. Wireless 

   Within this general use-case category there are several applications 
   of importance. The application, from the viewpoint of timing, is to 
   deliver the appropriate timing information to a base station (e.g. 
   Node B). 

2.1.1. CDMA2000 Base Station (frequency and time synchronization) 

   The relevant CDMA2000 standards are the 3GPP2 C.S0010-B and 3GPP2 C 
   S0002-B.  

   According to the CDMA2000 specifications the average frequency 
   difference between the actual CDMA transmit carrier frequency and

   specified CDMA transmit frequency assignment shall be less than 50 
   ppb. 

   In the CDMA2000 specifications it is also specified that each base 
   station shall use a time base reference that is time-aligned to CDMA 
   System Time.  CDMA System Time is synchronous to UTC time (except for 
   leap seconds) and uses the same time origin as GPS time.  All base 
   stations use the same System Time (within a small error tolerance).  
   For all base stations, the pilot time alignment error should be less 
   than 3us and shall be less than 10us.  

   Because of the above requirements it is a common practice to equip 
   CDMA base stations with GPS receivers. 

2.1.2. UMTS TDD Base Station (frequency and phase synchronization) 

   The timing requirement applicable to the WCDMA TDD radio interface 
   can be found in the technical specification TS 125.105 [B5]. 

   The radio interface requirement for UMTS TDD base stations is a 
   frequency accuracy of 50ppb; for the TDD mode there is the 
   additional requirement for the phase alignment of neighboring base 
   stations to within 2.5us. 

   Note: GSM and UMTS FDD require the frequency accuracy to be less 
   than 50ppB, but no need for phase alignment.


2.1.3. TD-SCDMA Base Station (frequency and phase synchronization) 

   The timing requirement applicable to the TD-SCDMA radio interface can 
   be found in the technical specification 3GPP TR 25.836. 

   The radio interface requirement for TD-SCDMA base stations is a 
   frequency accuracy of 50ppb; there is the additional requirement for 
   the phase alignment of neighboring base stations to within 3us (this 
   requirement is then measured comparing the phase between adjacent 
   Base Stations). 

   Because of the above requirements it is a common practice to equip 
   TD-SCDMA base stations with GPS receivers. 

   Note: the requirements listed in the previous clauses apply to the 
   radio interface. When time or frequency reference is carried by the 
   network, other requirements apply. These depend on several factors 
   such as Radio Base Station oscillator characteristics, filter 
   capability of the Radio Base Station, etc. As an example, 
 
 
Ji                     Expires August 3, 2008                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft  IEEE1588V2 telecom profile framework     February 2008 
    

   frequency accuracy significantly better than 50 ppb may be required 
   for the reference timing signal carried over the network in case of 
   50 ppb frequency accuracy requirement shall be fulfilled on the radio 
   interface. The value of 16 ppb (ITU-T G.812 Type II frequency 
   accuracy) has sometimes been mentioned. Similarly, in case accurate 
   time and/or phase shall be distributed to the Radio Base Stations, 
   the budget to be allocated to the network might be much smaller than 
   the requirements defined by the wireless standards to be fulfilled on 
   the radio interface. These aspects are for further study. 
   The things we need to do is cooperation with these standard bodies to
   specify the phase/time requirement of Base Station network interface.

              2.2. Other domains 

   Besides wireless application there are other applications that need 
   phase and/or time synchronization such as DVB, IPTV, etc. 
   We propose to address wireless application first.

   Figure 1 shows an example scenario for wireless application. Base 
   stations get time information from server though backhaul network. 
   Time server can be an SSU or be integrated in the RNC (BSC). 

3. Interface 

   As the Figure 1 shows, there are two important time interfaces 
   we should consider. One is the interface between time server and 
   NE (interface A). Another is the interface between Base station 
   and NE (interface B). 

              3.1. Interface type 

   To transport time information, using the Ethernet interface like FE 
   or GE using IEEE-1588V2 is a natural solution. 

   2048 kbit/s or 1544 kbit/s interfaces defined in G.703 have been use 
   for a long time for transport frequency information in telecom. Is it 
   necessary to define such a standard time interface? 

              3.2. Performance 

   The requirements listed above apply to the radio interface in Base 
   station. Interface B is network interface of Base station. It's 
   necessary to talk about the requirement of interface B with different 
   wireless standard body. Then we can specify the requirement of 
   interface A. The budget between interface A and B is the 
   specification for network equipments. 

4. Modeling 

   There was discussion on the email reflector about different solution. 
   One key issue is whether or not to use IEEE-1588 on-pass support. 

              4.1. On-pass support 

   'IEEE-1588 on-pass support' means that every node in the 
   synchroization chain from master to slave (server to client) can 
   support IEEE-1588. Three situations are listed in sections 4.1.1, 
   4.1.2 and 4.1.3.
  
   In this case, many parameters are required to be specified in a 
   profile, a list of them is proposed, but it is certainly not yet 
   exhaustive. 

      -- Size of the network (number of NEs in a synchronization chain).

      -- Characteristic of clocks (bandwidth, tolerance, 
      noise generation, etc.). 

      -- Types of IEEE-1588-V2 messages and packet rate. 

      -- Network Limits (see section 3.2). 

      -- Availability of a master clock protection mechanism (see 
      section 5).

4.1.1. Boundary Clock 

   The general concept of delivering time information by Boundary Clock
   (BC) modeling is given in Figure 2. There may be a number of BC nodes 
   involved in the distribution of the reference time signal. In such 
   cases, the synchronization function providing filtering and maybe
   holdover within these nodes must be able to recover time 
   synchronization from master. Synchronization is transported one by 
   one in a similar way to Synchronous Ethernet.

       | Time    |       |      |       |      |       |         |

                        Figure2. BC modeling 

   Note: It has been mentioned 1588 can be used combined with Sync-E. 
   In this case, the different parameters need to be considered. 
   Shall we consider it?

4.1.2. End-to-End Transparent Clock 

   As shows in figure3, the End-to-End Transparent Clock (E2ETC) is 
   totally different from Boundary Clock. Each E2ETC node involved in 
   the distribution of the reference time signal doesn't need to
   synchronize to the master. They measure the residence time of PTP 
   event messages (the time the message takes to traverse the 
   transparent clock node). These residence times are accumulated in
   a special field -called Correction Field.

4.1.3. Peer-To-Peer Transparent Clock 

   The Peer-To-Peer Transparent Clock (P2PTC) differs from the 
   End-To-End Transparent Clock in the way that it computes the link 
   delay in addition to the residence time delay. It uses the 
   Pdelay_Req, Pdelay_Resp, and possibly Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up messages 
   to compute the link delay.

   The P2PTC computes the link delay between two adjacent nodes.
   The appropriate Correction Field is updated for both the

   residence time of the message within the P2PTC nodes and for the link 
   delay on the port receiving the message. 

   Note: performance may be improved if E2ETC or P2PTC nodes implement  
   frequency synchronization similar to Ordinary Clocks (OC) or 
   Synchronous  Ethernet.

              4.2. No on-pass support 

   The second methods relies on time information such as IEEE-1588 
   messages carried by the network without 1588 support (no BCs or TCs)
   as shown in Figure 5. In case the intermediate nodes does not have 
   IEEE-1588 support especially where legacy equipment is used, this is 
   the only alternative to achieve time synchronization.

   It's not necessary for the support of a network-wide 1588 reference. 
   Therefore the performance is highly impacted by Packet Delay 
   Variation in the network. In order to minimize the impact from the 
   packet network, specific algorithms may need to be implemented at the 
   slave side, depending on the required accuracy.

   In this case, many parameters are required to be specified in a 
   profile, a list of them is proposed, but it is certainly not yet 
   exhaustive. 

      -- Size of the network and relevant PDV. 

      -- Characteristic of clocks (bandwidth, tolerance, noise 
      generation, etc.). 

      -- Types of 1588 V2 messages and packet rate. 

      -- Network Limits (see section 3.2). 

      -- Availability of a master clock protection mechanism (see 
      section 5).

   Note: One of the key points is network PDV for this situation which 
   ITU-T Q13/SG15 is studying. IEEE-1588 relies on the symmetry of the 
   network to recover ToD and/or phase, so the asymmetry of the network 
   will affect performance and in this case it may be difficult to 
   meet the time/phase synchronization for wireless applications. The 
   support for synchronous Ethernet has to be considered as well. 
   Synchronous Ethernet can be used to stabilize the local oscillator 
   time base. In this case, the frequency is stable as it is recovered 
   using Synchronous Ethernet and IEEE-1588 is used only for ToD and/or 
   phase.

              4.3. Hybrid 

   Hybrid Networks in this context represents networks where E2ETC 
   and/or BC are used in conjunction with legacy equipments. It is a 
   complex architecture, so. we propose to study it later. 


5. Time Distribution 

   Distribution mechanism is very important for network time 
   synchronization. BMC introduced in the IEEEE-1588V2 is a solution. 
   RON Cohen's daft 'PTP over MPLS' is another good suggestion for time 
   distribution in MPLS/IP network. 

   A list of aspects may be considered to specify a suitable 
   telecom mechanism, but it is certainly not yet exhaustive. 

      -- Find the best grandmaster. 

      -- Calculating the traceability paths if possible and path 
      selection.

      -- Building a tree like distribution (prevent timing-loop any 
      time).

      -- Fast switching when failure occurs to maintain a degree of 
      performance. 

6. Security Considerations
