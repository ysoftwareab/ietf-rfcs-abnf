   Framework for Automating Service and Network Management with YANG
           draft-wu-model-driven-management-virtualization-02

Abstract

   Model driven service and network management provides a programmatic
   and standards-based way of representing virtual services or networks
   and configuration to the network device that are used to construct
   the service.  It can be used at various phases of service and network
   management life cycle such as service instantiation, service
   provision, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic.  Also, it can be
   designed to automate network management and provide closed-loop
   control for the sake of agile service creation, delivery and
   maintenance.

   This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an
   architecture for service and network management automation with YANG
   Modeling technologies.  An applicability of YANG data model to
   automation of virtualized network service is also investigated.

1.  Introduction

   The manage system usually comprise service activation/provision
   system and service enforcement system.  Tranditional service delivery
   work flow, from customer order to practical service provision, the
   work flow process typically involves inputting data sequentially into
   multiple OSS/BSS applications managed by different departments; Many
   of these applications are custom built over the years and operating
   in silo mode; Lacking of standard data input/output also causes lots
   of challenge in system integration and results in manual data entry;
   Customer MACD(Move, Add, Change, Delete) will incur the same
   repetitive process in many cases.  Secondly traditional service
   fulfill system lack a programmatic and standards-based way of writing
   configurations to any network device and has slow response to the
   network changes and doesn't provide real time monitoring capability
   in high frequency and in high throughput on the current state of the
   system.  Therefore model driven network management becomes crutial to
   address these chanllenges.

   For years, the IETF has been driving the industry transition from an
   overloaded Software Defined Networking (SDN) buzzword to focus on
   specific areas such as modeling-driven network management.  [RFC7149]
   provides a first tentative to rationalize that space by identifying
   concrete technical domains that need to be considered:

   o  Techniques for the dynamic discovery of network topology, devices,
      and capabilities, along with relevant information and data models
      that are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and
      their capabilities.

   o  Techniques for exposing network services [RFC8309] and their
      characteristics.

   o  Techniques used by service-requirement-derived dynamic resource
      allocation and policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be
      programmed accordingly.

   o  Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
      efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
      service fulfillment and assurance perspective.

Internet-DraService and Network Management Automation with Y  March 2019


   Models are key for each of these technical items.  Automation is a
   key step to improve the agility of network operations and
   infrastructure.

   In the later development, as described in [RFC8199], YANG module
   developers have taken both top-down and bottom-up approaches to
   develop modules and establish mapping between network technology and
   customer requirements on the top or abstracting common construct from
   various network technologies.  At the time of writing this document
   (2018), we see the large number of data models including
   configuration models and service models developed or under
   development in IETF covering much of networking protocols and
   techniques.  In addition, how these models work together to fully
   configure a device, or manage a set of devices involved in a service
   aren't developed yet in IETF.

   This document takes both bottom up approach and top down approach to
   provide a framework that discusses the architecture for network
   management automation, with a focus on network virtualization
   environment.

   This document also describes specific YANG modules needed to realize
   connectivity services and investigates how top down built model
   (e.g., customer-facing data models) interact with bottom up built
   model (network resource-facing data models) in the context of service
   delivery and assurance.

2.  Architectural Concepts

2.1.  Data Models: Layering and Representation

   As described in [RFC8199], layering of modules allows for better
   reusability of lower-layer modules by higher-level modules while
   limiting duplication of features across layers.

   The IETF has developed large number of service level,network level
   and device level modules.  Different service level modules may rely
   on the same set of network level or device level modules.  Service
   level modules usually follow top down approach and are mostly
   customer-facing models providing a common model construct for higher
   level network services, which can be further mapped to network
   technology-specific models at lower layer.

   Network level modules mostly follow bottom up approach and are mainly
   network resource-facing model and describe various aspects of a
   network infrastructure, including devices and their subsystems, and
   relevant protocols operating at the link and network layers across
   multiple devices (e.g., Network topology and TE Tunnel modules).

Internet-DraService and Network Management Automation with Y  March 2019


   Device level modules usually follow bottom up approach and are mostly
   technology-specific modules used to realize a service.

2.2.  Service Activation and Provision Automation

   To provide more agile service offering, Service level module can be
   used by the operator to communicate with the customer and have rapid
   response to customer needs.  Network level module can be translated
   from service level module and used to provision, monitor, instantiate
   the service and provide lifecycle management of network
   resource,e.g., expose network resource to the customer or operators.

2.3.  Service Enforcement Configuration Model Composition

   To provide network management automation, lower level technology-
   specific models need to be assembled together to provision each
   involved network function/device and operate the network based on
   service requirements described in the service level model.

   IETF RTGWG working group has already been tasked to define service
   elements configuration model composition mechanism and develop
   several composition model such as network instance model, logical
   network element model and device model.

   These models can be used to setup and administrate both virtualized
   system and physical system.

2.4.  A Catalog for YANG Modules

   The idea of a catalog is similar to service catalogs in traditional
   IT environments.  Service catalogs serve as a software-based
   registries of available services with information needed to discover
   and invoke available services.

   The IETF has already tasked to develop a YANG catalog which can be
   used to manage not only IETF defined modules, but also non-IETF
   defined ones [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog].

   The YANG catalog allows to align IETF work with other SDOs work and
   prevent duplicated building blocks being developed.  It also
   encourages reusability of common building blocks.

   The YANG catalog allows both YANG developers and operators to
   discover the more mature YANG modules that may be used to automate
   services operations .

3.1.  Network Service and Resource Models

   Service and Network Resource modules define what the
   "service"/"resource" is.  These modules can be classified into two
   categories:

   o  Network Service Models

   o  Network Resource Models

3.1.1.  Network Service Models: Definition and Samples

   As described in [RFC8309], the service is some form of connectivity
   between customer sites and the Internet or between customer sites
   across the network operator's network and across the Internet.  Such
   connectivity service is described without resource allocation or with
   half service resource correlation.

   For example,

   o  L3SM model [RFC8299] defines the L3VPN service ordered by a the
      customer from a network operator.

   o  L2SM model [RFC8466] defines the L2VPN service ordered by a the
      customer from a network operator.

   o  L1CSM model [I-D.ietf-ccamp-l1csm-yang]defines a YANG data model
      for Layer 1 Connectivity Service Model (L1CSM).

   o  TEAS VN model [I-D. ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] defines YANG data
      model for the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered (TE)
      networks (ACTN) Virtual Network Service (VNS) operation.  Unlike
      L3SM model, ACTN model can also be used as operator facing model,
      e.g., establish interconnection between L3VPN sites across
      multiple ASs.

   o  TE service mapping model [I-D.lee-teas-te-service-mapping-yang] a
      YANG data model to map service model (e.g., L3SM) and Traffic
      Engineering model (e.g., TE Tunnel or the Abstraction and Control
      of Traffic Engineered Networks Virtual Network modelmodel).  This
      model is applicable to the operation's need for a seamless control
      and management of their VPN services with TE tunnel support and
      principally used to allow monitoring and diagnostics of the
      management systems to show how the service requests are mapped
      onto underlying network resource and TE models.

   o  Composed VPN model [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn] defines a
      YANG data model that can be used by a network operator to
      configure a VPN service in multiple administrative domain
      environment consisting of L2VPN or L3VPN or a mixture of the two.
      This model provides an abstracted view of VPN service
      configuration components at different layer.

3.1.2.  Network Resource Models

   Figure 1 shows a set of Network resource YANG modules such as
   topology models, tunnel models:

   o  L3 TE Topology Models

      When traffic engineering is enabled on a layer 3 network topology,
      there will be a corresponding TE topology.  [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-
      l3-te-topo] defines data models for layer 3 traffic engineering
      topologies.  Two data models are defined, one is layer 3 TE
      topology model, the other is packet switching TE topology model.

      Routing (SR) topology and Segment Routing (SR) traffic engineering
      (TE) topology.  Two models are defined, one is SR topology model,
      the other is SR TE topology model, SR topology model is extended
      from L3 Topology model.  SR TE topology model is extended from
      both SR Topology model and L3 TE topology model.

         between them, as well as how such links interconnect nodes and
         transponders.

   Tunnel YANG Models:

   o  TE Tunnel Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] defines a YANG module for the
      configuration and management of TE interfaces, tunnels and LSPs.

   o  SR TE Tunnel Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for Segment Routing (SR) TE
      specific data.

   o  MPLS TE Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for MPLS TE configurations,
      state, RPC and notifications.

   o  RSVP-TE MPLS Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-rsvp-te] augments the RSVP-TE generic module
      with parameters to configure and manage signaling of MPLS RSVP-TE
      LSPs.

   o  Optical Transport Tunnel Models:

      *  Flexigrid Media Channel Tunnel Models: [I-D.ccamp-flexigrid-
         media-channel-yang] defines a YANG model for the flexi-grid
         media-channel.  This YANG module defines the whole path from a
         source transponder or node to the destination through a number
         of intermediate nodes in the flexi-grid network.

      *  WSON Tunnel Model: [I-D.ccamp-wson-tunnel-model] defines a YANG
         data model for WSON tunnel model.

      *  OTN Tunnel Model: [I-D.  ietf-ccamp-otn-tunnel-model]defines a
         YANG data model for OTN tunnel Model.

      [I.D-ietf-teas-path-computation] yang model for a stateless RPC
      which complements the stateful solution defined in [I.D-ietf-teas-
      yang-te].

   o  OAM Models

      [I.D-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam] defines a base YANG module
      for the management of OAM protocols that use Connectionless
      Communications.  [I.D-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods]
      defines a retrieval method YANG module for connectionless OAM
      protocols.  [I.D-ietf-lime-yang-connection-oriented-oam-model]
      defines a base YANG module for connection oriented OAM protocols.
      These three models can be used to provide consistent reporting,
      configuration and representation.

   o  Alarm Models

      Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
      Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the
      network services or necessarily point to the root cause.  [I.D-
      ietf-ccamp-alarm-module]defines a YANG module for alarm
      management.

   o  Generic Policy Model

      The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based
      management framework [RFC8328] defines base YANG data models to
      encode policy.  These models point to device-, technology-, and
      service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.  Policy
      rules within an operator's environment can be used to express
      high-level, possibly network-wide, policies to a network
      management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a
      network element).  The network management function can then
      control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements
      and services.  This document describes the SUPA basic framework,
      its elements, and interfaces.

3.2.  Network Element Models

   Network Element models are used to describe how a service can be
   implemented by activating and tweaking a set of functions (enabled in
   one or multiple devices) that are involved in the service delivery.

3.2.1.  Model Composition

   o  Device Model

      [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-device-model] presents an approach for organizing
      YANG models in a comprehensive logical structure that may be used
      to configure and operate network devices.The structure is itself



Wu, et al.              Expires September 9, 2019              [Page 12]

Internet-DraService and Network Management Automation with Y  March 2019


      represented as an example YANG model, with all of the related
      component models logically organized in a way that is
      operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be
      implemented.

   o  Logical Network Element Model

      [RFC8530] defines a logical network element module which can be
      used to manage the logical resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for logical resource partitioning are Logical Systems or Logical
      Routers.

   o  Network Instance Model

      [RFC8529] defines a network instance module.  This module can be
      used to manage the virtual resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for virtual resource partitioning are Virtual Routing and
      Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs).

3.2.1.1.  Schema Mount

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  [RFC8528] defines a mechanism, denoted schema
   mount, that allows for mounting one data model consisting of any
   number of YANG modules at a specified location of another (parent)
   schema.

   That capability does not cover design time.

3.2.2.  Protocol/Function Configuration Models

   BGP:       [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-yang-model] defines a YANG module for
              configuring and managing BGP, including protocol, policy,
              and operational aspects based on data center, carrier and
              content provider operational requirements.

   MPLS:      [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang] defines a base model for MPLS
              which serves as a base framework for configuring and
              managing an MPLS switching subsystem.  It is expected that
              other MPLS technology YANG models (e.g.  MPLS LSP Static,
              LDP or RSVP-TE models) will augment the MPLS base YANG
              model.

   QoS:       [I-D.asechoud-netmod-diffserv-model] describes a YANG
              model of Differentiated Services for configuration and
              operations.

   ACL:       Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements
              used to configure device forwarding behavior.  It is used
              in many networking technologies such as Policy Based
              Routing, Firewalls etc.  [I.D-ietf-netmod-acl-model]
              describes a data model of Access Control List (ACL) basic
              building blocks.

   NAT:       For the sake of network automation and the need for
              programming Network Address Translation (NAT) function in
              particular, a data model for configuring and managing the
              NAT is essential.  [I.D-ietf-opsawg-nat-yang] defines a
              YANG module for the NAT function.

   Multicast: [I-D.ietf-pim-yang] defines a YANG module that can be used
              to configure and manage Protocol Independent Multicast
              (PIM) devices.  [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-yang] defines a
              YANG module that can be used to configure and manage
              Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast
              Listener Discovery (MLD) devices.  [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-
              snooping-yang] defines a YANG data model that can be used
              to configure and manage Internet Group Management Protocol
              (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping
              devices.

   EVPN:      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] defines a YANG data model for
              Ethernet VPN services.The model is agnostic of the
              underlay.  It apply to MPLS as well as to VxLAN
              encapsulation.  The model is also agnostic of the services
              including E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE services.  This
              document mainly focuses on EVPN and Ethernet-Segment
              instance framework.

   L3VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang] defines a YANG model that can
              be used to configure and manage BGP L3VPNs [RFC4364].  It
              contains VRF sepcific parameters as well as BGP specific
              parameters applicable for L3VPNs.

   L2VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] defines a YANG data model for
              MPLS based Layer 2 VPN services (L2VPN) [RFC4664] and
              includes switching between the local attachment circuits.
              The L2VPN model covers point-to-point VPWS and Multipoint
              VPLS services.  These services use signaling of
              Pseudowires across MPLS networks using LDP
              [RFC8077][RFC4762] or BGP[RFC4761].

   Routing Policy:  [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] defines a YANG data
              model for configuring and managing routing policies in a
              vendor-neutral way and based on actual operational
              practice.  The model provides a generic policy framework
              which can be augmented with protocol-specific policy
              configuration.

   BFD:       [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]defines a YANG data model that can be
              used to configure and manage Bidirectional Forwarding
              Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].  BFD is a network protocol
              which is used for liveness detection of arbitrary paths
              between systems.

   SR/SRv6:   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang] a YANG data model for segment
              routing configuration and operation.  [I-D.raza-spring-
              srv6-yang] defines a YANG data model for Segment Routing
              IPv6 (SRv6) base.  The model serves as a base framework
              for configuring and managing an SRv6 subsystem and
              expected to be augmented by other SRv6 technology models
              accordingly.

   Core Routing:  [RFC8349] defines the core routing data model, which
              is intended as a basis for future data model development
              covering more-sophisticated routing systems.  It is
              expected that other Routing technology YANG models (e.g.
              VRRP, RIP, ISIS, OSPF models) will augment the Core
              Routing base YANG model.

   PM Models:

              [I.D-ietf-ippm-twamp-yang] defines a data model for client
              and server implementations of the Two-Way Active
              Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).

              [I.D-ietf-ippm-stamp-yang] defines the data model for
              implementations of Session-Sender and Session-Reflector
              for Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
              mode using YANG.

              [RFC8194] defines a data model for Large-Scale Measurement
              Platforms (LMAPs).

4.  YANG model Catalog for L3VPN Service

   The model catalog provides enough information for users to determine
   which YANG modules or module bundles are available to describe a
   specific service or technology.  Take L3VPN service as an example,
   IETF has already developed L3VPN service model [RFC8299] which can be



Wu, et al.              Expires September 9, 2019              [Page 15]

Internet-DraService and Network Management Automation with Y  March 2019


   used to describe L3VPN service.  To enforce L3VPN service and program
   the network, a set of network element models are needed, e.g., BGP
   model, Network Instance model, ACL model, Multicast Model, QoS model,
   NAT model, these network element models can be grouped into different
   release bundles or feature bundle using Schema Mount technology to
   meet different tailored requirements and realize L3VPN service.  To
   support the creation of logical network elements on a network device
   and enable automation of virtualized network, Logical Network
   Element(LNE) model can be used to manages its own set of modules such
   as ACL, QoS, Network Instance modules.

   The overview of structure of Network slice in the 3GPP 5GS is shown
   in Figure 4.  The terms are described in the 3GPP documents (e.g.,

   To support 5G service(e.g.,5G MBB service), L3VPN service model
   [RFC8299] and TEAS VN model [I-D. ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] can be both
   provided to describe 5G MBB Transport Service or connectivity
   service.  L3VPN service model is used to describe end to end
   connectivity service and TEAS VN model is used to describe TE
   connectivity service between VPN sites or between RAN NFs and Core
   network NFs.  VN in TEAS VN model and support point to point or
   multipoint to multipoint connectivity service and can be seen as one
   example of Network slice.TE Service mapping model can be used to map
   L3VPN service requests onto underlying network resource and TE models
   to get TE network setup.  For IP VPN service provision, L3VPN service
   model will be translated into a set of network element configuration
   parameters, these configuration parameters will go to different
   network element models and group them together to form feature bundle
   or service bundle to get L3VPN network setup.

6.1.  End-to-End Service Delivery and Service Assurance Procedure

6.1.1.  Resource Collection and Abstraction (a)

   Network Resource such as links, nodes, or terminate-point resources
   can be collected from the network and aggregated or abstracted to the
   management system.  Periodic fetching of data is not an adequate
   solution for applications requiring frequent or prompt updates of
   network resource.  Applying polling-based solutions to retrieve
   network resource also imposes a load on networks, devices, and
   applications.These limitations can be addressed by including generic
   object subscription mechanisms within network elements.

   These resources can be modelled using network topology model, L3
   topology model, L2 topology model, TE topology model, L3 TE topology
   model, SR TE topology models at different layers.

   In some cases, there may have multiple overlay topologies built on
   top of the same underlay topology, and the underlay topology can be
   also built from one or more lower layer underlay topology.

   In some cases, there may have multiple overlay topologies built on
   top of the same underlay topology, and the underlay topology can be
   also built from one or more lower layer underlay topology.  The
   network resources and management objects in these multi-layer
   topologies are not recommended to be exposed to customers who (will)
   order the service from the management system, instead it will be
   exposed to the management system for IP service mapping and TE path
   Management.

   The abstract view is likely to be technology-agnostic.

6.1.2.  Service Exposure & Abstraction (b)

   Service exposure & abstraction is used to capture services offered to
   customers.

   Service abstraction can be used by a customer to request a service
   (ordering and order handling).  One typical example is that a
   customer can use L3SM service model to request L3VPN service by
   providing the abstract technical characterization of the intended
   service.  Such L3VPN service describes various aspects of network
   infrastructure, including devices and their subsystems, and relevant
   protocols operating at the link and network layers across multiple
   device.  The L3SM service model can be used to interact with the
   network infrastructure, e.g., configure sites, decide QoS parameters
   to be applied to end to end connectivity between VPN sites, select
   PEs, CEs, etc.

   Service catalogs can be created to expose the various services and
   the information needed to invoke/order a given service.

   YANG modules can be grouped into various service bundles; each
   service bundle is corresponding to a set of YANG modules that have
   been released or published.  Then, a mapping can be established
   between service abstraction at higher layer and service bundle or a
   set of YANG modules at lower layer.

6.1.3.  IP Service Mapping (c)

   Service abstraction starts with high-level abstractions exposing the
   business capabilities or capturing customer requirements.  Then, it
   needs to maps them to resource abstraction and specific network
   technologies.

   Therefore, the interaction between service abstraction in the overlay
   and network resource abstraction in the underlay is required.  For
   example, in the L3SM service model, we describe VPN service topology
   including sites relationship, e.g., hub and spoke and any to any,
   single homed, dual-homed, multi-homed relation between PEs and CEs,
   but we don't know how this service topology can be mapped into
   underlying network topology.  For detailed interaction, please refer
   to Section 6.1.8

   In addition, there is a need to decide on a mapping between service
   abstraction and underlying specific network technologies.  Take L3SM
   service model as an example, to realize L3VPN service, we need to map
   L3SM service view defined in Service model into detailed
   configuration view defined by specific configuration models for
   network elements, these configuration models include:

   o  VRF definition, including VPN Policy expression

   o  Physical Interface

   o  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6).

   o  QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in the document, as well as routing policies associated
      with those protocols.

   o  Multicast Support

   o  NAT

6.1.4.  IP Service Composition (d)

   These detailed configuration models are further assembled together
   into service bundle described inFigure 2 using, e.g., device model,
   logical network element model or network instance model defined in
   [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-device-model] [RFC8530] [RFC8529] and provide the
   association between an interface and its associated LNE and NI and
   populate them into appropriate devices(e.g., PE and CE).

6.1.5.  IP Service Provision (e)

   IP Service Provision is used to provision network infrastructure
   using various configuration models, e.g., use network element models
   such as BGP, ACL, QoS, Interface model, Network instance models to
   configure PE and CE device within the site.  BGP Policy model is used
   to establish VPN membership between sites and VPN Service Topology.

Internet-DraService and Network Management Automation with Y  March 2019


   Traditionally, "push" service element configuration model one by one
   to the network device and provide association between an interface
   and each service element configuration model is not efficient.

   To automate configuration of the service elements, we first assemble
   all related network elements models into logical network element
   model defined in [RFC8530] and then establish association with an
   interface and a set of network element configurations.

   In addition, IP Service Provision can be used to setup tunnels
   between sites and setup tunnels between PE and CE within the site
   when tunnels related configuration parameters can be generated from
   service abstraction.However when tunnels related configuration
   parameters can not be generated from service abstraction, IP Service
   to TE Mapping procedure is required.

6.1.6.  Performance Measurement and Alarm Telemetry (f)

   Once the tunnel is setup, PM and Warning information per tunnel or
   per link based on network topology can be collected and report to the
   management system.  This information can be used to optimize the
   network or provide troubleshooting support.

6.1.7.  IP Service to TE Mapping (g)

   Take L3VPN service model as an example, the management system will
   use L3SM service model to determine where to connect each site-
   network-access of a particular site to the provider network (e.g.,
   PE, aggregation switch).  L3SM Service model proposes parameters and
   constraints that can influence the meshing of the site-network-
   access.

   Nodes used to connect a site may be captured in relevant clauses of a
   service exposure model (e.g., Customer Nodes Map [RFC7297]).

   When Site location is determined, PE and CE device location will be
   selected.  Then we can replace parameters and constraints that can
   influence the meshing of the site-network-access with specified PE
   and CE device information associated with site-network-access and
   generate resource facing VN Overlay Resource model.One example of
   resource facing VN Overlay Resource model is TEAS VN Service Model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang].

   This VN Overlay Resource model can be used to calculate node and link
   resource to Meet service requirements based on Network Topology
   models collected at step (a).

Internet-DraService and Network Management Automation with Y  March 2019


6.1.8.  Path Management (h)

   Path Management includes Path computation and Path setup.  For
   example, we can translate L3SM service model into resource facing VN
   Model, with selected PE and CE in each site, we can calculate point
   to point or multipoint end to end path between sites based on VN
   Overlay Resource Model.

   After identifying node and link resources required to meet service
   requirements, the mapping between overlay topology and underlay
   topology can be established, e.g., establish an association between
   VPN service topology defined in customer facing model and underlying
   network topology defined in the TE topology model (e.g., one overlay
   node is supported by multiple underlay nodes, one overlay link is
   supported by multiple underlay nodes) and generate end to end VN
   topology.

6.1.9.  TE Resource Exposure (i)

   When tunnels related configuration parameters can not be generated
   from service abstraction, IP Service to TE Mapping procedure can be
   used to generate TE Resource Exposure view, this TE reource Exposure
   view can be modeled as resource facing VN model which is translated
   and instantiated from L3SM model and manage TE resource based on path
   management information and PM and alarm telemetry information.

   Operators may use this dedicated TE resource Exposure view to
   dynamically capture the overall network status and topology to:

   o  Perform all the requested recovery operations upon detecting
      network failures affecting the network service.

   o  Adjust resource distribution and update to end to end Service
      topology models

   o  Provide resource scheduling to better guarantee services for
      customers and to improve the efficiency of network resource usage.

   The following steps are performed to deliver the service within the
   network management automation architecture proposed in this document:

   o  Pre-provision multiple virtualized networks on top of the same
      basic network infrastructure based on pre-configured service
      requirements and establish resource pool for each virtualized
      network and expose to the customer with several service templates
      through web portal.

   o  Selects and uses one which fulfills most its requirement among the
      service templates.

   o  Create resource facing VN Network based on selected service
      template, and calculate the node resource, link resource
      corresponding to connectivity between sites.

   o  Setup tunnels between sites and map them into the selected
      virtualized network topology and establish resource facing VN
      topology based on TEAS VN model [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] and
      TE tunnel based on TE Tunnel model.

      The resource facing VN model and corresponding TE Tunnel model can
      be further used to notify all the parameter changes and event
      related to VN topology or Tunnel.  These information can be
      further used to adjust network resource distributed in the
      network.

   The network initiated resource creation is similar to ready made
   Network Slice creation pattern discussed in section 5.1 of [I-
   D.homma-slice-provision-models].

   o  Create a new service topology based on Service Type and service
      requirements (e.g., Slice Service Type, Slice location, Number of
      Slices, QoS requirements corresponding to network connectivity
      within a Slice) defined in L3SM service model.

   o  Translate L3SM service model into resource facing TEAS VN Model
      [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang], and calculate the node resource,
      link resource corresponding to connectivity between sites or
      connectivity between PE and CE within Site in the service topology
      based on generated resource facing TEAS VN model.

   o  Setup tunnels between sites and tunnel between PE and CE within
      Site and map them into basic network infrastructure and establish
      resource facing VN topology based on TEAS VN model and TE tunnel
      based on TE Tunnel model.  The resource facing TEAS VN model and
      corresponding TE Tunnel model can be used to notify all the
      parameter changes and event related to VN topology or Tunnel.
      These information can be further used to adjust network resource
      distributed within the network.
