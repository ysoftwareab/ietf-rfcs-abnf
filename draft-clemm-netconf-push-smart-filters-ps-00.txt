              draft-clemm-netconf-push-smart-filters-ps-00

Abstract

   This document defines a problem statement for Smart Filters for Push
   Updates.  Smart Filters for Push Updates (referred to simply as
   "Smart Filters" in the context of this document) allows to filter
   push updates based on values of pushed objects and/or state, such as
   previous updates.  Smart Filters provide an important building block
   for service assurance and network automation.

1.  Introduction

   YANG-Push [yang-push] allows client applications to subscribe to
   continuous datastore updates without needing to poll.  YANG-Push
   subscriptions allow client applications to select which datanodes are
   of interest.  For this purpose, filters that act as node selectors
   are offered.  However, what is currently not supported are filters
   that filter updates based on values, such as sending updates only
   when the value falls within a certain range.  Also not supported are
   filters that would require additional state, such as sending updates
   only when the value exceeds a certain threshold for the first time
   but not again until the threshold is cleared.  We refer to such
   filters as "smart filters", with further subcategories of "smart
   stateless filters" and "smart stateful filters", respectively.

   Smart filters involve more complex subscription and implementation
   semantics than the simple selection filters that are currently
   offered as part of YANG-Push.  They involve post processing of
   updates that goes beyond basic update generation for polling
   avoidance and place additional intelligence at the server.  Because
   of this, smart filter functionality was not included in the YANG-Push
   specification, although it was recognized that YANG-Push could be

   extended to include such functionality if needed.  This is the
   purpose of this specification.

   Smart filters facilitate service assurance, because they allow client
   applications to focus on "outliers" and updates that signify
   exceptions and conditions of interest have the biggest operational
   significance.  They save network resources by avoiding the need to
   stream updates that would be discarded anyway, and allow applications
   to scale better since larger networks imply a larger amount of smart
   filtering operations delegated away from the application to the
   network.  Smart filters also facilitate network automation as they
   constitute an important ingredient to specify triggers for automated
   actions.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Definitions and Acronyms

      Smart Filter: A filter that involves some processing, such as
      comparing values or differentiating behavior depending on state.

      TCA: Threshold Crossing Alert.

      YANG-Push: A server capability that allows client applications to
      subscribe to network management datastore updates.

4.  Problem Statement

   YANG-Push provides client applications with the ability to subscribe
   to continuous updates from network management datastores, obviating
   the need to perform polling and resulting in more robust and
   efficient applications.  However, many applications do not require
   every update, only updates that are of certain interest.

   For example, an update concerning interface utilization may be only
   needed when a certain utilization level is breached.  Sending
   continuous updates when utilization is low might divert processing
   resources away from updates regarding interfaces whose utilization
   level may reach a critical point that requires attention.  Doing so
   will require a filter based on an object value.  Even sending
   continuous updates when utilization is high may be too much and
   counterproductive.  It may be sufficient to send an update when a



Clemm, et al.            Expires April 21, 2018                 [Page 3]

   threshold is breached to raise a flag of attention, but then not to
   continue sending updates while the condition still persists but
   simply let the client application know when the threshold is cleared.
   This behavior cannot be accomplished simply by a value-based filter,
   but requires additional state to be maintained (so that the server
   has a memory whether or not the condition of a breached threshold has
   already been reported in prior update cycles).

   What is needed are "Smart Filters" that provide the ability to apply
   filters based on object values, possibly also state.  Smart Filters
   are useful for Service Assurance applications that need to monitor
   operational data for values that fall outside normal operational
   ranges.  They are also useful for network automation, in which
   automated actions are automatically triggered based on when certain
   events in the network occur while certain conditions hold.  A YANG-
   Push subscription with a smart filter can in effect act as a source
   for such events.  Combined with an optional check for a condition
   when an event is observed, this can serve as the basis of action
   triggers.

   Of course, it is possible to conceive filters that are very smart and
   powerful yet also very complex.  While filters as defined in YANG-
   Push may be a tad too simple for the applications envisioned here, it
   is important to keep filters still simple enough to ensure broad
   implementation and support by networking devices.  The smart filters
   defined in this effort intend to apply the "90/10" rule, aiming at
   the sweet spot that addresses 90% of use cases and deployment
   scenarios that can be addressed using 10% of the complexity.  Where
   those filters are not sufficient, additional filters can be
   introduced outside this document.

   It is proposed that Smart Filters for Push Updates will provide
   support for the following features:

   o  Support for smart filter extensions to YANG-Push subscriptions.
      The targeted model takes a "base" YANG-Push subscription and
      subjects updates to an additional filtering stage that is based on
      an object's value.

      *  Filters that match or compare the object value against a fixed
         term or expression.

      *  Filters that match or compare an object value against the value
         of another object.  (This feature is useful particularly in
         conjunction with possible extensions that allow to compute
         aggregates.  Such an ability opens the possibility to compare
         an object's current value to its mean, for example.)

Internet-Draft                                              October 2017


   o  Support for refined on-change update semantics that allow client
      to distinguish whether object values were omitted or included
      because the object was created or deleted, or because the object's
      value fell outside filter range.

   o  Support for selected stateful filters:

      *  This includes specifically support for generalized "threshold
         crossing alert" filters, or filters that provide an update only
         when an object's value passes a filter for the first time, and
         not again until the object's value passes a counter filter.  In
         effect, the support involves attaching filter and counter
         filter to an object, including a switch at the object
         indicating which filter is in effect, and providing a
         distinction in the update which filter (e.g. onset of clear)
         was applied.

      *  It may include additional filters, such a "recent high water
         mark" filters that allow to specify a time horizon until the
         current high water mark clears.  A recent high water mark
         filter sends an update to an object only if its new value is
         greater than the last value that had been previously reported.

   In order to constrain complexity, it is proposed that the following
   items will be outside the scope, subject to discussion by the Working
   Group:

   o  Filters that involve freely programmable logic.

   o  Filters that aggregate or otherwise process information over time.
      An example would be filters that compute an aggregate over a time
      series of data, for example, an object's average or top percentile
      value.  (One way in which this can be accomplished is by defining
      a separate YANG module that allows to specify aggregates
      independent of any filtering, then asking users to subscribe to
      updates of the aggregate objects and applying filters there.  The
      definition of such an aggregation module goes beyond the scope of
      the work defined here.)

   o  Filters that aggregate object's values with those of other
      objects, such as the maximum or average from objects over a list,
      or that operate on a function of other objects.  An example would
      be an object for interface utilization that gets computed from
      objects for interface speed and interface packet rate, with the
      packet rate object itself potentially computed from counter
      snapshots that are taken at different times.  (One way in which
      this can be accomplished is by defining a separate YANG module
      that allows to define objects that compute such functions akin to

      the Expression MIB [RFC2982], then asking users to subscribe to
      updates of those objects and applying filters there.)

5.  IANA Considerations

   Not applicable

6.  Security Considerations

   The application of smart filters requires a certain amount of
   processing resources at the server.  An attacker could attempt to
   attack a server by creating YANG-push subscriptions with a large
   number of complex smart filters in an attempt to diminish server
   resources.  Server implementations can guard against such scenarios
   in several ways.  For one, they can implement NACM [RFC6536] in order
   to require proper authorization for requests to be made.  Second,
   server implementations can reject requests made for a a larger number
   of smart filters than the implementation can reasonably sustain.
