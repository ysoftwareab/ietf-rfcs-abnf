1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow
   monitoring of running instances of robust header compression.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Overview

   This section describes the basic model of RObust Header Compression
   (ROHC, [RFC3095]) used when developing the MIB modules for ROHC
   described in the following sections.

   ROHC presents a framework for IP header compression that allows
   flexible adjustment of compression efficiency versus robustness
   against channel errors depending on the underlying channel
   characteristics.

   ROHC introduces header compressors/decompressors at the end-points
   (interfaces) of (wireless) channels on which packets with compressed
   headers are transferred.  ROHC exploits the temporal redundancy in
   successive packet headers of a packet flow by storing non-changing
   fields of the headers as well as reference values of predictably
   changing fields as context information.  When the context information
   for a packet flow is also established at the decompressor, only
   delta-information and unpredictably changing header fields have to be
   sent over the channel.

   This document specifies MIB modules in order to provide a means for
   managing ROHC implementations via SNMP and within the IETF management
   framework.  The objects defined support configuration management,
   fault management and performance monitoring.

   For configuration management implementation parameters (see Section
   6.3. of [RFC3095]) and configuration parameters (including the ones
   specified in Section 5.1.1 of [RFC3095] and in Section 5.1.1 of
   [RFC3242]) can be verified by using the MIB modules specified below.

   For fault management compressor/decompressor state and mode can be
   checked.

   For performance management a set of statistics is provided including
   the number of flows that have used ROHC, the current and long term
   compression ratio, the number of reinitializations and the number of
   packets sent or received with different header types.


4.  Structure of the MIB modules

   This section presents the structure of the MIB modules that are
   specified in Section 5.  Basically, the MIB is structured according
   to the ROHC architecture described in [RFCXXXX].


Quittek, Stiemerling, Hartenstein                               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   December 2003


   ROHC is an evolving technology.  [RFC3095] specifies the header
   compression framework and four profiles: uncompressed, RTP, UDP, and
   ESP (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User Datagram Protocol,
   Encapsulating Security Payload).  [RFC3242] specifies a profile with
   additional link layer assistance called LLA (Link Layer Assisted).  A
   profile for compression of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) flows
   is under development within the ROHC working group and SCTP (Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol) compression is being discussed as
   potential next candidate.  Therefore, the managed objects defined
   below are structured into three MIB modules: the general ROHC-MIB
   module and the profile-specific ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB and ROHC-RTP-
   MIB modules.  This flexible approach allows to support future
   profiles each by its own profile-specific module.

   The ROHC-MIB module defines properties of information on ROHC
   instances, ROHC channels, ROHC profiles, and ROHC compressor and
   decompressor contexts.  All managed objects in this module are
   assumed to be shared by all profiles.

   The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module extends the ROHC-MIB by managed
   objects that are specific to the ROHC uncompressed profile 0x0000
   defined in [RFC3095].  The ROHC-RTP-MIB module extends the ROHC-MIB
   by managed objects that are specific to the three profiles defined in
   [RFC3095] (ROHC RTP profile 0x0001, ROHC UDP profile 0x0002, and ROHC
   ESP profile 0x0003), and to the ROHC LLA profile 0x0005 defined in
   [RFC3242].  An analysis of these profiles showed that they are
   tightly related and can share most of the managed objects in the
   ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module.  Therefore, a joint module for all of
   them was preferred to individual modules.

   The number of managed objects in the ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB Module and
   the ROHC-RTP-MIB Module is rather small.  They contain context state
   and context mode, and profile-specific context statistics.  It is
   assumed that MIB modules for future profiles, such as TCP and SCTP,
   will be similarly small and easy to design.

4.1.  The ROHC-MIB module

   The ROHC-MIB module defines managed objects that are expected to be
   useful for all current and future ROHC profiles. Objects in the ROHC-
   MIB module are arranged into four tables: the rohcChannelTable, the
   rohcInstanceTable, the rohcProfileTable, and the rohcContextTable.
   The managed objects in the first three tables are rather static
   (except for provided statistics), while the objects in the
   rohcContextTable are more dynamic.

   All tables are indexed by the IP interface number and by a numeric
   channel identifier.  The channel identifier is used for channels to
   which compressors and decompressors are attached (called ROHC
   channels in [RFCXXXX]), as well as for dedicated feedback channels


Quittek, Stiemerling, Hartenstein                               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   December 2003


   (called ROHC feedback channels in [RFCXXXX]).  Compressor and
   decompressor instances are further indexed by their type (either
   compressor or decompressor). Contexts are indexed by the same index
   as their corresponding instance and their individual context
   identifier (CID).

4.1.1.  rohcChannelTable

   The rohcChannelTable lists all channels used by ROHC instances for
   transferring compressed packets and/or for giving feedback from the
   decompressor to the compressor.  Listed channels are either ROHC
   channels or feedback channels as defined in [RFCXXXX].  The channels
   are listed per IP interface.

   The information per channel in the rohcChannelTable includes

    o   the channel ID,

    o   the channel type, either 'notIn&Use', 'rohc', or
        'dedicatedFeedback',

    o   the channel for which feedback is provided by this channel (if
        applicable),

    o   a string for describing the channel, and

    o   the status of the channel being either 'enabled' or 'disabled'.

4.1.2.  rohcInstanceTable

   The rohcInstanceTable defines properties of ROHC compressor instances
   and ROHC decompressor instances.

   As described in [RFCXXXX], an instance is associated with exactly one
   channel and only one instance can be associated with the same
   channel.  Therefore, the same index consisting of ifIndex and
   rohcChannelID could have been used for both tables.  But when
   accessing the rohcInstanceTable (and the rohcContextTable that shares
   a part of its index with the rohcInstanceTable) there are many cases
   where either a compressor contexts or a decompressor contexts are of
   interest.  Therefore, the rohcInstanceType indicating either a
   compressor or a decompressor was added to the table's index.  This
   allows listing all compressors without accessing any decompressor.
   Note that still the combination of ifIndex and rohcChannelID uniquely
   identifies an instance.  It is always possible to directly identify
   and access the channel corresponding to a given instance.

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   December 2003


   The set of instance properties in the rochInstanceTable includes

    o   the vendor of the implementation, version number and
        description,

    o   the channels used for compressed packets and for feedback,

    o   implementation and configuration properties including clock
        resolution, maximum context identifier number (MAX_CID), the
        LARGE_CIDS flag, and the Maximum Reconstructed Reception Unit
        (MRRU),

    o   the storage time for contexts created by this instance,

    o   the status of the instance (operational or not).

   Optionally, the rohcInstanceTable also contains instance statistics
   including

    o   the total number of compressed flows,

    o   the current number of compressed flows,

    o   the total number of packets passing this instance, and

    o   the total compression ratio achieved on the channel.

   Instances are listed per IP interface.

4.1.3.  rohcProfileTable

   The rohcProfileTable lists available profiles per instance including
   information on

    o   the profile number,

    o   the vendor and version number, and

    o   a string describing the profile.

    o   a flag indicating whether or not using this profile has been
        negotiated with the corresponding (de)compressor.

4.1.4.  rohcContextTable

   The rohcContextTable lists compressor contexts or decompressor
   contexts per instance and context identifier (CID).  Each row of this
   table represents a context.  If a new context is created, also a new
   row in this table is created.  After expiration or termination of a
   context, the row will continue to exist until the context's storage


Quittek, Stiemerling, Hartenstein                               [Page 6]

   time expires or until the CID is re-used. Then the row will be
   deleted.

   For each context, the following attributes are listed:

    o   the type of context ('compressor' or 'decompressor'), also used
        as part of the table index,

    o   the CID,

    o   the state of the CID ('unused', 'active', 'expired', or
        'terminated'), also used as part of the table index,

    o   the used profile,

    o   in case of a decompressor: the decompressor depth, and

    o   the storage time.

   Optionally, context statistics is provided including

    o   activation and deactivation time of the context,

    o   the number of packets sent or received, respectively,

    o   the numbers of IRs and IR-DYNs sent or received, respectively,

    o   the number of feedbacks sent or received, respectively,

    o   in case of a decompressor context: the numbers of decompressor
        failures and repairs,

    o   the total compression ratio of all packets passing this context,

    o   the total compression ratio of all packet headers compressed in
        this context,

    o   the mean compressed packet size of all packets passing this
        context,

    o   the mean header size of all compressed headers passing this
        context,

    o   the compression ratio of the last 16 packets passing this
        context,

    o   the compression ratio of the last 16 packet headers compressed
        in this context,

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   December 2003


    o   the mean compressed packet size of the last 16 packets passing
        this context,

    o   the mean header size of the last 16 compressed headers passing
        this context.

4.2.  The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module

   The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module defines managed objects that are
   specific to ROHC uncompressed profile (0x0000) specified in
   [RFC3095].

4.2.1.  rohcUncmprContextTable

   The rohcUncmprContextTable extends the rohcContextTable. It provides
   information on state and mode of the compressor for profile 0x0000.
   Optionally, it also provides a counter of ACK feedbacks sent or
   received by the context, respectively.

4.3.  The ROHC-RTP-MIB module

   The ROHC-RTP-MIB module defines managed objects that are specific to
   three profiles specified in [RFC3095] (ROHC RTP profile 0x0001, ROHC
   UDP profile 0x0002, and ROHC ESP profile 0x0003) and to the ROHC LLA
   profile 0x0005 specified in [RFC3242].  The ROHC-RTP-MIB contains two
   tables, the rohcRtpContextTable and the rohcRtpPacketSizeTable.

4.3.1.  rohcRtpContextTable

   The rohcRtpContextTable extends the rohcContextTable. It provides
   information on context state and context mode for profiles 0x0001 -
   0x0003 and 0x0005.  For compressor contexts it optionally contains
   managed object containing the numbers of allowed and used packet
   sizes.  As futher option, counters of the numbers of ACKs, NACKs, and
   SNACKs in this context are specified.

4.3.2.  rohcPacketSizeTable

   The optional rohcPacketSizeTable lists per compressor context the
   allowed packet sizes for profiles ROHC RTP, ROHC UDP, ROHC ESP, or
   the preferred packet sizes for ROHC LLA, respectively.  Allowed
   packet sizes are marked if they are used. For preferred packet sizes,
   it is indicated whether the preferred size applies to NHP only, to
   RHP only or to all packets.

6.  Security Considerations

   The managed objects defined by the ROHC-MIB module, the ROHC-
   UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module and the ROHC-RTP-MIB module do not have a
   MAX-ACCESS value of read-write and/or read-create except
   rohcInstanceContextStorageTime and rohcContextStorageTime, both of
   which have a MAX-ACCESS value of read-write.  These objects determine
   how long context information is stored after its termination.
   Unauthorized access to these objects can have one of two negative
   effects.  If they are set to a value lower than required, e.g. to
   zero, then context information about past contexts might get lost.
   If they are set to a very high value, then context information will
   not be deleted and memory consumption of the agent implementation
   might become very high.  However, unauthorized access to these
   objects cannot cause harm to existing ROHC connections nor can it
   allow manipulation of running instances of ROHC in a malicious way.

   Another security issue is unauthorized access to readable objects in
   the MIB modules for getting information about existing communication
   sessions.  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  However,
   the only information that might be disclosed is the use of channels.
   Users and their addresses are not visible in the MIB.  This
   information can only be mis-used in conjunction with the mis-use of
   further information.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
