Abstract
   
   This memo describes Textual Conventions and OBJECT-IDENTITIES 
   for use in definitions of management information for IP Over 
   InfiniBand (IPOVERIB) networks. The intent is that these TEXTUAL
   CONVENTIONs (TCs) will be imported and used in IPOVERIB related
   MIB modules.

1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in IETF IPOVERIB 
   and IPOVERIB-related MIBs.
   

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   
   For an introduction to the concepts of InfiniBand, see [INFINIV1].


3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

        The reserved field is octet 20. It is reserved for future use.
        These bits MUST be set to zero.

        The Queue Pair Number field is a 3 octet field (octets 17, 18, &
        19) that identifies the destination queue pair. Note: The 
        reserved field and the QPN field are collectively referred to as
        the interface-id. If an IPOIB interface has only 1 GID 
        associated with it, the interface-id MAY contain all zeroes.

        The Global Identifier field is a 16 octet field (octets 1 
        through 16) that is formed by the combination of the IB subnet 
        prefix and the port's GUID. It is unique in the InfiniBand 
        fabric. NOTE: An IPOIB interface may have more than 1 GID 
        associated with it."

   This memo defines textual conventions and object identities for use
