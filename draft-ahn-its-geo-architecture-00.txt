Internet-Draft  Architectural Framework of IPv6-based Geo  December 2016


Abstract

   For IPv6-based ITS applications, ITS data packets are required to be
   delivered based on the geographical location information of
   the destination ITS node or area. In this draft, we describe
   the architecture of the IPv6-based Geographical Forwarding System
   (IGFS).

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   For the support of IPv6-based ITS (Intelligent Transportation System)
   applications, ITS data packets are required to be delivered based
   on the geographical location (longitude and latitude) information of
   the destination ITS node or area.

   From the considerations in [Geo-Problem], in this draft, we describe
   the architecture of the IPv6-based Geographical Forwarding System
   (IGFS).


3.  Terminology

   IPv6-based Geographical Forwarding System (IGFS)
       The conceptual system consisting of ITS nodes, Location Databases
       (LDBs), Geographical Forwarding DHCPs (G-DHCPs), etc.

   ITS node
       A vehicle or a device (e.g., roadside unit (RSU)) that may
       generate ITS-related data in the form of IPv6 datagrams.

   Geographical Location (Geo-location)
      The location of an ITS node represented in the form of
      longitude and latitude. The geo-location information
      is represented in the form of the World Geodetic System 1984
      (WGS84) [WGS-84] formatted coordinates.

   Geographical Forwarding
       IPv6 datagram forwarding based on the geo-location information
       of the source and the destination ITS node or area.

   Geographical Forwarding Address (Geo-Address)
       An IPv6 address for geographical forwarding that belongs to
       a geographical forwarding address range assigned by IANA.
       An ITS node should have a geo-address to be involved in
       geographical forwarding of IPv6 datagrams.

   Geographical Forwarding DHCP (G-DHCP) Server
       A DHCP server with geo-addresses to be assigned to ITS nodes.

Internet-Draft  Architectural Framework of IPv6-based Geo  December 2016


   Location Database (LDB)
       The database with geo-location information of ITS nodes;
       that is, the database with mapping information of
       geo-locations and geo-addresses of its associated ITS nodes;
       there can be more than one LDBs which may form a hierarchy.
 
   Destination Area
       The rectangular area in which this IPv6 datagram needs to be
       forwarded; that is, all the ITS nodes in the destination area are
       supposed to receive this IPv6 datagram.


4.  IPv6-based Geographical Forwarding System 

   The main entities of the IPv6-based Geographical Forwarding System
   (IGFS) are ITS nodes, Location Databases (LDBs), Geographical
   Forwarding DHCP (G-DHCP) servers (TBD more, if needed).

   If a node wishes to involve in geographical forwarding of IPv6
   datagrams, it SHOULD get a geographical forwarding address
   (geo-address) from a G-DHCP server with the IPv6 addresses for
   geographical forwarding.

   An ITS node SHOULD register its geo-address in the LDB that it is
   associated with. The association with an LDB is to be defined later.

   When an ITS node has ITS data to send by geographical forwarding,
   the geographical location information of the destination ITS node or
   area can be obtained by referring to one or more LDBs or
   from the upper layer (e.g., the coordinate information from a map
   in the application layer).


5.  Other Considerations

   TBD.
