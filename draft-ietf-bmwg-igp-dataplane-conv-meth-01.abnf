   3.2.6 Packet Sampling Interval
   Selection of the Packet Sampling Interval on the Test Equipment 
   impacts the measured Rate-Derived Convergence Time.  Packet
   Sampling Interval time is that is too large exaggerates the 
   slope of the Convergence Event Transition and Convergence 
   Recovery Transition producing a larger than the actual Rate-Derived  
   Convergence Time.  This impact is greater as routers achieve 
   millisecond convergence times.  The recommended value for the
   Packet Sampling Interval is 100 millisecond.  It is possible to 
   have commercially available test equipment with a minimum 
   configurable Packet Sampling Interval of 1 second.  

   3.2.7 Interface Types
   All test cases in this methodology document may be executed with
   any interface type.  SONET is recommended and specifically 
   mentioned in the procedures because it can be configured to have 
   no or negligible affect on the measured convergence time.  
   Ethernet (10Mb, 100Mb, 1Gb, and 10Gb) is not preferred since 
   broadcast media are unable to detect loss of host and rely upon 
   IGP Hellos to detect session loss.

   3.3 Reporting Format
   For each test case, it is recommended that the following reporting 
   format be completed:
	
           	      IGP Data Plane Route Convergence
