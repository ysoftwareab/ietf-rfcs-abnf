Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
   for representing presence information for a presentity.  That format
   defines a textual note, an indication of availability (open or

   closed) and a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) for communication.
   The Rich Presence Information Data format (RPID) described here is an
   extension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information
   Data Format (PIDF).  These extensions provide additional information
   about the presentity and its contacts.  The information is designed
   so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar
   files or user activity.

   This extension includes information about what the person is doing, a
   grouping identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last
   used, the type of place a person is in, what media communications
   might remain private, the relationship of a service tuple to another
   presentity, the person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the
   type of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's status
   and the overall role of the presentity.

   These extensions include presence information for persons, services
   (tuples) and devices.

1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) definition [8] describes
   a basic presence information data format, encoded as an Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) document, for exchanging presence information
   in systems compliant with the common model for presence and instant
   messaging [5].  It consists of a <presence> root element, zero or
   more <tuple> elements carrying presence information including a
   Universal Resource Identifier (URI) for communication. zero or more
   <note> elements and zero or more extension elements from other name
   spaces.  Each tuple defines a basic status of either "open" or
   "closed".

   However, it is frequently useful to convey additional information
   about a user that needs to be interpreted by an automata, and is
   therefore not appropriate to be placed in the <note> element of the
   PIDF document.  Therefore, this specification defines extensions to
   the PIDF document format for conveying richer presence information.
   Generally, the extensions have been chosen to provide features common
   in existing presence systems at the time of writing, in addition to
   elements that could readily be derived automatically from existing
   sources of presence, such as calendaring systems or communication
   devices, or sources describing the user's current physical
   environment.

   The presence data model [12] defines the concepts of service, device,
   and person as the data elements that are used to model the state of a
   presentity.  Services are encoded using the <tuple> element, defined
   in PIDF; devices and persons are represented by the <device> and
   <person> XML elements, respectively, defined in the the data model
   [12].  However, neither PIDF nor the data model define presence
   attributes beyond the <basic> status element.

   This specification defines additional presence attributes to describe
   person, service and device data elements, summarized as "Rich
   Presence Information Data format for presence" (RPID).  These
   attributes are specified by XML elements which extend the PIDF
   <tuple> element and the <device> and <person> elements defined in the
   data model.

   This extension has two main goals:

   1.  Provide rich presence information that is at least as powerful as
       common commercial presence systems.  Such feature-parity
       simplifies transition to CPIM-compliant systems, both in terms of
       user acceptance and protocol conversion.

   2.  Maintain backwards-compatibility with PIDF, so that PIDF-only
       watchers and gateways can continue to function properly,
       naturally without access to the functionality described here.

   We make no assumptions how the information in the RPID elements is
   generated.  Experience has shown that users are not always diligent
   about updating their presence status.  Thus, we want to make it as
   easy as possible to derive RPID information from other information
   sources, such as personal calendars, the status of communication
   devices such as telephones, typing activity and physical presence
   detectors as commonly found in energy-management systems.

   Many of the elements correspond to data commonly found in personal
   calendars.  Thus, we attempted to align some of the extensions with
   the usage found in calendar formats such as iCal [10].

   The information in a presence document can be generated by a single
   entity or can be composed from information published by multiple
   entities.

   Note that PIDF documents and this extension can be used in two
   different contexts, namely by the presentity to publish its presence
   status and by the presence server to notify some set of watchers.
   The presence server MAY compose, translate or filter the published
   presence state before delivering customized presence information to
   the watcher.  For example, it may merge presence information from
   multiple presence user agents, remove whole elements, translate
   values in elements or remove information from elements.  Mechanisms
   that filter calls and other communications to the presentity can
   subscribe to this presence information just like a regular watcher
   and in turn generate automated rules, such as scripts [11], that
   govern the actual communications behavior of the presentity.  Details
   are described in the data model document.

   Since RPID is a PIDF XML document, it also uses the content type
   application/pidf+xml.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in the IMPP Model
   document [5].  Terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT MESSAGE, OPEN, PRESENCE
   SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT in the memo are
   used in the same meaning as defined therein.

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  RPID Elements

3.1  Overview

   Some of the RPID elements describe services, some devices, and some
   the person.  As such, they either extend <tuple>, <device> or
   <person>, respectively.  Below, we summarize the RPID elements.  The
   next sections will then provide more detailed descriptions.
   activities: The <activities> status element enumerates what the
      person is doing.
   class: An identifier that groups similar person elements, devices or
      services.
   device-id: A device identifier in a tuple references a <device>
      element, indicating that this device contributes to the service
      described by the tuple.
   mood: The <mood> status element indicates the mood of the person.
   place-is: The <place-is> status elements reports on the properties of
      the place the presentity is currently at, such as the levels of
      light and noise.
   place-type: The <place-type> status elements reports the type of
      place the person is located in, such as 'classroom' or 'home'.
   privacy: The <privacy> element distinguishes whether the
      communication service is likely to be observable by other parties.
   relationship: When a service is likely to reach a user besides the
      person associated with the presentity, the relationship indicates
      how that user relates to the person.
   service-class: The <service-class> element describes whether the
      service is delivered electronically, is a postal or delivery
      service or describes in-person communications.
   sphere: The <sphere> element characterizes the overall current role
      of the presentity.
   status-icon: The <status-icon> element depicts the current status of
      the person or service.
   time-offset: The <time-offset> status element quantifies the time
      zone the person is in, expressed as the number of minutes away
      from UTC.
   user-input: The <user-input> element records the user-input or usage
      state of the service or device, based on human user input.

   The usage of these elements within the <person>, <tuple> and <device>
   elements is shown in columns 4 through 6 of Table 1.  An 'x' in the
   respective column indicates that the RPID element MAY appear as a
   child of that element.

   +------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

                                  Table 1

   In general, it is unlikely that a presentity will publish or announce
   all of these elements at the same time.  Rather, these elements were
   chosen to give the presentity maximum flexibility in deriving this
   information from existing sources, such as calendaring tools, device
   activity sensors or location trackers, as well as to manually
   configure this information.  In either case, there is no guarantee
   that the information is accurate, as users forget to update calendars
   or may not always adjust the presence information manually.

   The namespace URIs for these elements defined by this specification
   are URNs [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [4]
   and extended by [6]:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid

   The elements marked with the value 'x' in column 2 of Table 1 MAY be
   qualified with the 'from' and 'until' attributes to describe the
   absolute time when the element assumed this value and the absolute
   time until which is element is expected to be valid.  Note that there

   can be multiple elements of the same type, whose time ranges SHOULD
   NOT overlap.

   Elements MAY contain an 'id' attribute that allows to uniquely
   reference the element.

   Enumerations can be extended by elements from other namespaces.  The
   <activities>, <mood> and <place-type> elements can also take <other>
   elements containing text, for custom free-text values specific to an
   application.

   All elements described in this document are optional within PIDF
   documents.

3.2  Activities Element

   The <activities> element describes what the person is currently
   doing, expressed as an enumeration of activity-describing elements.
   A person can be engaged in multiple activities at the same time,
   e.g., traveling and having a meal.  The <activities> element can be
   quite helpful to the watcher in judging how appropriate a
   communication attempt is and which means of communications is most
   likely to succeed and not annoy the person.  The activity indications
   correspond roughly to the category field in calendar entries, such as
   Section 4.8.1.2 of RFC 2445 [10].

   An activities enumeration consists of one or more elements using
   elements drawn from the list below, a string enclosed in the <other>
   element or IANA-registered values from other namespaces (Section 7).

   If a person publishes an activity of "permanent-absence", it is
   likely that all services will report a status of CLOSED.  In general,
   services MAY advertise either service status for any activity value.

   Activities such as <appointment>, <breakfast>, <dinner>, <holiday>,
   <lunch>, <meal>, <meeting>, <performance>, <travel>, or <vacation>
   can often be derived from calendar information.

   appointment: The person has a calendar appointment, without
      specifying exactly of what type.  This activity is indicated if
      more detailed information is not available or the person chooses
      not to reveal more information.
   away: The person is physically away from all interactive
      communication devices.  This activity element was included since
      it can often be derived automatically from security systems,
      energy management systems or entry badge systems.  While this
      activity would typically be associated with a status of CLOSED
      across all services, a person may declare itself away to

      discourage communication, but indicate that it still can be
      reached if needed.  However, communication attempts might reach an
      answering service, for example.
   breakfast: The person is eating the first meal of the day, usually
      eaten in the morning.
   busy: The person is busy, without further details.  While this
      activity would typically be associated with a status of CLOSED
      across all services, a person may declare itself busy to
      discourage communication, but indicate that it still can be
      reached if needed.
   dinner: The person is having his or her main meal of the day, eaten
      in the evening or at midday.
   holiday: This is a scheduled national or local holiday.
   in-transit: The person is riding in a vehicle, such as a car, but not
      steering.  The <place-type> element provides more specific
      information about the type of conveyance the person is using.
   looking-for-work: The presentity is looking for (paid) work.
   lunch: The person is eating his or her midday meal.
   meal: The person is scheduled for a meal, without specifying whether
      it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, or some other meal.
   meeting: The person is in an assembly or gathering of people, as for
      a business, social, or religious purpose.  A meeting is a sub-
      class of an appointment.
   on-the-phone: The person is talking on the telephone.  This activity
      is included since it can often be derived automatically.
   other: The person is engaged in an activity with no defined
      representation as an <activities> element.  The enclosed string
      describes the activity in plain text.
   performance: A performance is a sub-class of an appointment and
      includes musical, theatrical and cinematic performances as well as
      lectures.  It is distinguished from a meeting by the fact that the
      person may either be lecturing or be in the audience, with a
      potentially large number of other people, making interruptions
      particularly noticeable.
   permanent-absence: The person will not return for the foreseeable
      future, e.g., because it is no longer working for the company.
      This activity is associated with a status of CLOSED across all

   sleeping: This activity category can often be generated automatically
      from a calendar, local time information or biometric data.
   spectator: The person is observing an event, such as a sports event.
   steering: The person is controlling a vehicle, ship or plane.
   travel: The person is on a business or personal trip, but not
      necessarily in-transit.
   tv: The person is watching television.
   unknown: The activity of the person is unknown.  This element is
      generally not used together with other activities.
   vacation: A period of time devoted to pleasure, rest, or relaxation.
   working: The presentity is engaged in, typically paid, labor, as part
      of a profession or job.
   worship: The presentity is participating in religious rites.

   The <activities> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.

   Example:


     <activities>
       <note>Enjoying the morning paper</note>
       <vacation/>
       <breakfast/>
       <other>reading</other>
     </activities>



3.3  Class Element

   The <class> element describes the class of the service, device or
   person.  Multiple elements can have the same class name within a
   presence document, but each person, service or device can only have
   one class label.  The naming of classes is left to the presentity.
   The presentity can use this information to group similar services,
   devices or person elements or to convey information that the presence
   agent can use for filtering or authorization.  This information is
   not generally presented to the watcher user interface.

   The <class> element MUST NOT be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.


3.4  Device Identifier

   The <deviceID> element in the <tuple> element references the device
   that provides a particular service.  The element is defined

   syntactically in the data model [12] schema.  One service can be
   provided by multiple devices, so that each service tuple may contain
   zero or more <deviceID> elements.  There is no significance in the
   order of these elements.

   The <deviceID> element MUST NOT be qualified with the 'from' and
   'until' attributes as described in Section 3.1.

3.5  Mood Element

   The <mood> element describes the mood of the presentity.  They are
   enumerated chosen by the presentity.  The mood itself is provided as
   the element name of a defined child element of the <mood> element
   (e.g., <happy/>); one such child element is REQUIRED.  The user MAY
   also specify a natural-language description of, or reason for, the
   mood in the <text> child of the <mood> element, which is OPTIONAL.
   (This definition follows the Jabber Extension JEP-107.)  It is
   RECOMMENDED that an implementation support the mood values proposed
   in Jabber Extension JEP-0107, which in turn are a superset of the
   Wireless Village [14] mood values and the values enumerated in the
   Affective Knowledge Representation that has been defined by Lisetti
   [13]:

   A mood enumeration consists of one or more elements using elements
   drawn from the list below, a string enclosed in the <other> element
   or IANA-registered values from other namespaces (Section 7).

   The <activities> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.

3.6  Place-is Element

   The <place-is> element describes properties of the place the person
   is currently at.  This offers the watcher an indication what kind of
   communication is likely to be successful.  Each major media type has
   its own set of attributes.  Omitting the element indicates that the
   property is unknown.

   For audio, we define the following attributes:

   noisy: The person is in a place with a level of background noise that
      makes audio communications difficult.
   ok: The environmental conditions are suitable for audio
      communications.
   quiet: The person is in a place such as a library, restaurant, place-
      of-worship, or theater that discourages noise, conversation and
      other distractions.
   unknown: The place attributes for audio are unknown.

   For video, we define the following attributes:

   toobright: The person is in a bright place, sufficient for good
      rendering on video.
   ok: The environmental conditions are suitable for video.
   dark: The person is in a dark place, and thus the camera may not be
      be able to capture a good image.
   unknown: The place attributes for video are unknown.

   For text, we define the following attributes:

   uncomfortable: Typing or other text entry is uncomfortable.
   inappropriate: Typing or other text entry is inappropriate, e.g.,
      since the user is in a vehicle or house of worship.
   ok: The environmental conditions are suitable for text-based
      communications.
   unknown: The place attributes for text are unknown.

   This list can be augmented by free-text values in a note or
   additional IANA-registered values (Section 7).

         <noisy />
       </audio>
       <video>

       </video>
     </place-is>


   The <place-is> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.

3.7  Place-type Element

   The <place-type> element describes the type of place the person is
   currently at.  This offers the watcher an indication what kind of

   The <place-type> element is a choice of elements, as in

     <place-type>
       <street/>
     </place-type>


   The <place-type> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.


3.8  Privacy Element

   The <privacy> element indicates which types of communication third
   parties in the vicinity of the presentity are unlikely to be able to
   intercept accidentally or intentionally.  This does not in any way
   describe the privacy properties of the electronic communication
   channel, e.g., properties of the encryption algorithm or the network
   protocol used.

   audio: Audio communication is likely only to be heard by the intended
      recipient.
   text: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see text
      communications.
   unknown: This information is unknown.
   video: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see video
      communications.

      The <privacy> element can be used by logic executing on the
      watcher or by a composer to filter, sort and label tuples.  For
      example, a composer may have rules that limit the publication of
      tuples labeled as "private" to a select subset of the watchers.

   The <privacy> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.

   Example:


     <privacy>
       <text/>
       <audio/>
     </privacy>



3.9  Relationship Element

   The <relationship> element extends <tuple> and designates the type of
   relationship an alternate contact has with the presentity.  This
   element is provided only if the tuple refers to somebody other than
   the presentity.  Relationship values include "family", "friend",
   "associate" (e.g., for a colleague), "assistant", "supervisor",
   "self" and "unknown".  The default is "self".

   If a relationship is indicated, the URI in the <contact> element
   refers to the entity, such as the assistant, that has a relationship
   to the presentity, not the presentity itself.

   Like tuples without a <relationship> qualifier, the <contact> element
   for tuples labeled with a relationship can contain either a
   communication URI such as "im", "sip", "sips", "h323", "tel" or
   "mailto", or a presence URI, such as "pres" or "sip".

   Example:


     <relationship>

       <friend/>
     </relationship>



3.10  Service Class

   The <service-class> element extends <tuple> and designates the type
   of service offered.

   electronic: Delivery of information by electronic means, i.e.,
      without delivering physical objects.  Examples include telephone,
      fax, email, instant messaging, and SMS.
   postal: Delivery by the postal service, e.g., as a letter, parcel or
      postcard.  Delivery could be to a post office box or central mail
      room rather than the presentity's office location, for example.
   courier: Delivery by messenger, overnight delivery or courier.
      Courier-delivered messages are usually delivered to a receptionist
      rather than, say, a mailroom or receiving department.
   freight: Delivery by freight carrier, typically of larger objects
      that are not sent by postal mail or courier.  The recipient is
      often the shipping department or a loading dock.
   in-person: Describes the coordinates for visits in person, as by a
      visitor, i.e., usually somebody's office or residence.
   unknown: The type of service is unknown.

   Electronic service is implied if omitted.  The service types
   'postal', 'courier', 'freight' and 'in-person' MUST NOT be used
   unless the contact URI is empty.  Additional data elements defined
   elsewhere describe the physical service delivery address for the in-
   person, postal or delivery services.  Such addresses might be
   specified in geospatial coordinates, civic addresses or some
   specialized address format, e.g., for interstellar addresses or a
   company-specific delivery system.

   Example:


     <service-class><postal/></service-class>



3.11  Sphere Element

   The <sphere> element designates the current state and role that the
   person plays.  For example, it might describe whether the person is
   in a work mode or at home or participating in activities related to
   some other organization such as the IETF or a church.  This document



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires March 28, 2006                [Page 18]

   does not define names for these spheres except for two common ones,
   "work" and "home", as well as "unknown".

   Spheres allow the person to easily turn on or off certain rules that
   depend on what groups of people should be made aware of the person's
   status.  For example, if the person is a Boy Scout leader, he might
   set the sphere to "scouting" and then have a rule set that allows
   other scout masters in his troop to see his presence status.  As soon
   as he switches his status to "work" or "home" or some other sphere,
   the fellow scouts would lose access.

   The <sphere> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.1.

   Example:


     <sphere>
       <home/>
     </sphere>



3.12  Status-Icon Element

   The <status-icon> element includes a URI pointing to an image (icon)
   representing the current status of the person or service.  The
   watcher MAY use this information to represent the status in a
   graphical user interface.  Presentities SHOULD provide images of
   sizes and aspect ratios that are appropriate for rendering as an
   icon.  Support for JPEG, PNG and GIF formats is RECOMMENDED.

   Watchers resolving the URI MUST validate whether the local copy of
   the icon is current when receiving a notification, using the standard
   cache control mechanism in the URI-identified retrieval protocol.

   Example:


     <status-icon>http://www.example.com/playing.gif</status-icon>



3.13  Time Offset

   The <time-offset> element describes the number of minutes of offset
   from UTC at the person's current location.  A positive number
   indicates that the local time-of-day is ahead (i.e., east of)



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires March 28, 2006                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                    RPID                    September 2005


   Universal Time, while a negative number indicates that the local
   time-of-day is behind (i.e., west of) Universal Time.  Transitions
   into and out of daylight savings time may temporarily cause a
   difference between the true offset from UTC and the time offset
   element.

   An optional attribute, description, can be used to describe the
   offset, e.g., by labeling the time zone.  This description is meant
   for human consumption.

   Publishers on mobile devices SHOULD NOT publish this information
   unless they know the time offset information to reflect the current
   location.  (For example, many laptop users do not update their time
   zone when traveling.)  Publishers SHOULD update the information
   whenever they discover that their UTC offset has changed.

   Example:


     <time-offset description="America/New_York">-300
     </time-offset>



3.14  User-Input Element

   The <user-input> element records the user-input or usage state of the
   service or device, based on human user input, e.g., keyboard,
   pointing device or voice.  If contained in a <person> element, it
   summarize any user input activity across all services and devices
   operated by the presentity.  The mechanism for such aggregation is
   beyond the scope of this document, but generally reflects the most
   recent user input across all devices and services.  The element can
   assume one of two values, namely 'active' or 'idle', with an optional
   'last-input' attribute that records when the last user input has been
   received.  An optional 'idle-threshold' element records how long the
   presentity will wait before reporting the service or device to be
   idle, measured in seconds.

   (A two-state model was chosen since it would otherwise be necessary
   to send repeated last-input updates during continuous activity.)

   A service that wants to indicate user input activity sends a <user-
   input> 'active' indication when the user has provided user input
   within a configurable interval of time, the idle-threshold.  If the
   user ceases to provide input and the idle threshold has elapsed, the
   tuple is marked with a <user-input> 'idle' indication instead,
   optionally including the time of last activity in the 'last-input'



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires March 28, 2006                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                    RPID                    September 2005


   attribute.  An example is below:

     <user-input idle-threshold="600"
       last-input="2004-10-21T13:20:00.000-05:00">idle</user-input>

   Depending on device or service capabilities, user input may be
   detected only for a particular application, i.e., when the
   application has user focus or when a user has sent a message or
   placed a call, or can be based on user input across all applications
   running on one end system.

   The <user-input> element may be used by a watcher, typically in
   combination with other data, to estimate how likely a user is to
   answer when contacting the service.  A tuple that has not been used
   in a while may still be OPEN, but a watcher may choose to first
   contact a URI in a tuple that is both OPEN and has been used more
   recently.

   The <user-input> attribute can be omitted if the presentity wants to
   indicate that the device has not been used for a while, but does not
   want to reveal the precise duration, as in:

     <user-input>idle</user-input>

   Configuration MUST include the option to omit the 'last-input'
   attribute.

4.  Example

   The example below describes the presentity
   'pres:someone@example.com', which has a SIP contact,
   'sip:someone@example.com', representing a service.  It also has a
   device contact, as an email box.  The presentity is in a meeting, in
   a public office setting.  The 'until' information indicates that he
   will be there until 5.30 pm local time.  The presentity also has an
   assistant, sip:secretary@example.com, who happens to be available for
   communications.

5.  XML Schema Definitions

   The RPID schema is shown below.  Due to limitations in composing
   schemas, not all XML documents that validate against the schema below
   are semantically valid RPID documents.  In particular, the schema
   allows each element to appear anyhere in PIDF or data-model elements;
   Table 1 restricts where these elements can appear for semantically
   valid RPID documents.  Elements that do not have from/until
   parameters MUST NOT appear more than once in each <person>, <tuple>
   or <device>.

6.  Extending RPID

   To add new elements to the enumerations <activities>, <mood>, <place-
   type>, <privacy>, <relationship> and <service-class>, the extension
   process described in PIDF [8] is followed, i.e., such extensions
   would use namespace designators such as
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:ext, where 'ext' is the name of the
   extension.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
     'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid'

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid
   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX [RFC editor:  replace with RFC number] to describe rich
      presence information extensions for the status element in the PIDF
      presence document format in the application/pidf+xml content type.

7.2  Schema Registration for Schema
     urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:status:rpid'

   URI: please assign
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See Section 5

   Note that this document does not need a new content type.  It
   inherits the content type from [8], namely application/pidf+xml.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [8] apply, as well as [7].  Compared
   to PIDF, this presence document format reveals additional information
   about presentities that can be highly sensitive.  Beyond traditional
   security measures to protect confidentiality and integrity, systems
   should offer a means to selectively reveal information to particular
   watchers and to inspect the information that is being published,
   particularly if it is generated automatically from other sources,
   such as calendars or sensors.

   Like any reference to an external object, the <status-icon> may allow
   the presentity to induce the watcher to retrieve data from a third
