Abstract

   This document introduces a new option in DHCPv4 for Service-Oriented
   Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv4
   Clients provide.  The Service-Oriented Address can be either
   Anycast/Shared Unicast or a Well-known Unicast Addresses.  This
   address assignment is much similar to other address type assignments,

   except that Service-Oriented Address assignment requires the
   specification of Service Type of the node that is requesting the
   address.

Internet-Draft    Service-Oriented Address Assignment Using DHCPv6              
 February 2005

1.  Introduction

   "Anycast address" is an identifier for a set of interfaces 
   (typically belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to an 
   anycast address is routed to the "nearest" interface having that 
   address, depending on the distance of the routing path.  Anycast
   addresses can be used as unique service identifiers for many services
   such as Domain Name System (DNS) Servers, Web-Servers etc.

   Also usage of Well-known Unicast Addresses is being increasing for
   acheiving Zero-configuration.

   DHCPv4 base specification [RFC2131] provides a way for the DHCPv4
   clients to get permanent/temporary unicast addresses from a DHCPv4
   Server.  This document provides a way for assigning an address to a
   Service provided by the DHCPv4 Clients.  An address that is assigned
   to a service is called Service-Oriented Address (SOA).  The
   Service-Oriented Address can be Anycast/Shared Unicast or a
   Well-known Unicast Address.  This document introduces a new Service Address
   option in DHCPv4 for Service-Oriented Address assignment for a
   particular type of service that DHCPv4 Client provides.  This address
   assignment is much similar to other address types assignments, except
   that the Service-Oriented Address assignment requires the specification
   of Service Type while requesting this address assignement.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Applicability Statements

   With successful adoption of the Anycast Addresses in IPv6 the efforts
   are going on towards the usage of the similar concept in IPv4([RFC 3068]).
   But its usage has been restricted to nodes which are routers.  However,
   the work is in progress to implement the anycast address support in IPv4
   Hosts.

   Anycast addresses can be used as unique service identifiers.  Many
   services such as Domain Name System (DNS) and HTTP proxy are operated
   on the Internet.  It is troublesome that users have to know IP
   addresses of servers for accessing these services at each site.  If
   each service had its own unique anycast address as its service
   identifier and its servers used the address for their network

Internet-Draft    Service-Oriented Address Assignment Using DHCPv6              
 February 2005

   interfaces, users could access the service only with the anycast
   address.  This mechanism can ease users into using services.

   Currently no mechanism exists to automatically configure the hosts
   with a specific (anycast) address for a particular service.  Also
   usage of Well-Known Addresses is increasing for achieving
   zero-configuration.  Currently these addresses are being preloaded
   into the devices before shipping them to the end-users.

   This draft is applicable to the Nodes that provide well-known
   services (e.g.  DNS Servers) and administrator defined servers using
   Anycast/Shared Unicast Addressing (e.g.  Web Servers) for dynamically
   assigning the addresses corresponding the services they provide using
   DHCPv6.

4.  DHCPv4 specification dependency

   This document describes new DHCPv4 option for service-oriented
   address assignment.  This document should be read in conjunction with
   the DHCPv4 specification [RFC2131].  Definitions for terms
   and acronyms not specifically defined in this document are defined in
   [RFC2131].

5.  Service-Oriented Address Option

   Service-Oriented Address Request is an option through which a client can 
   request a server a spcefic service-oriented address. Server identify,
   group and manage a set of related IPv4 service-oriented addresses.
   Server maintains associated configuration information for each client for
   Service-Oriented Address is similar to other adresses as described in
   [RFC2131] for unicast addresses.


   The client can request IPv4 addresses for one or more services in same 
   message with multiple option for different service type . Configuration
   options will be sent by the Server can be sent to client with one or more
   replies with separate parameter list for each of the address list.

5.1  Service-Oriented Address Option Format

   The Service-Oriented Address option carries the information about the
   requested/offered address. 

   The format of the Service Oriented Address option is:

					         Service Oriented Address

   Field description

   o Code :  Service Oriented Address Option (TBD).

   o Len:   7 (Bytes).

   o Service-Type:  The Service Type for which Anycast/Shared Unicast/
   Well-Known Address to be assigned.

   o Anycast:   1 : If the address is an Anycast
                0 : Otherwise

   o Service Oriented Address:  Address allocated by DHCPv4 Server for  
                                Service Type requested by DHCPv4 Client.
                   

   Anycast sub-option specifies that the address is an Anycast address or not.
   Client can request specifically anycast address using this sub-option and the
   Server can set the field to 1 if the address allocated for a requested service
   type is a Anycast address. Server SHOULD allocate any available address for
   selected service, if the Anycast sub-option is set to zero. Server SHOULD 
   ignore the request for Anycast address if the Anycast address address is not
   present for selected service. Server MUST set the Anycast sub-option to 1 if
   the address for the selected service is Anycast address.
    
   Service-Oriented address field in the option will be field by the DHCPv4 Server.
   This field in the option will be set to zero by the client while sending the
   request message and will be ignored by the server while processing it.

Internet-Draft    Service-Oriented Address Assignment Using DHCPv6

   An Service-Oriented Address option may only appear in the options area
   of a DHCP message. A DHCP message may contain multiple Service 
   Orieneted Address options.All other paramter list will remain same 
   as per any other address.


6.  Overview of Service-Oriented Address Assignment

   The DHCPv4 Client that wants to get Service-Oriented Address for a
   specific service Type includes Service Oriented Address option in
   the Solicitation and/or Request that it sends to DHCPv4 Server
   with the Service-Type. If the client requires Service-Oriented
   addresses for multiple service types, it can include multiple 
   Service-Oriented Address option fields in Solicitation and/or
   Request Messages.

   The DHCPv4 server then checks the availability of the Service-Oriented
   Address for the requested service type.  If the Service-Oriented Address
   pertinent to the Service Type is configured in the DHCPv4 Server to
   assign to the clients, then the server fills the Service-Oriented 
   Address in Service-Oriented Address field of Service Oriented option
   with the service type details. The presence of this option conveys the
   DHCPv4 client that the address allocated is for the service specified
   in the Service-Oriented Address Option and address is present in the same
   option.

   If there are multiple Service-Oriented Address available for the same
   service type the server can typically send one or multiple responses to
   the client with same service type included.

   Address assignment and the other operation of the basic DHCP remains
   same excpet the request for the Service-Oriented Address option in
   Request and Reply Message.  

7.  Security Considerations

   The DHCPv4 Option defined here allows a malicious server providing
   incorrect address information to the client, causing users with valid
   service-oriented address unable to use services.  This is a well
   known property of the DCHP protocol [RFC2131].  This option does not
   create any additional risk of such attacks.



8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new DHCPv6 option that IANA needs
   assign a code from DHCPv6 Option codes name space:

   Option Name                         Value     Described in

   Service-Oriented Address Option      TBD       Section 5.1

Internet-Draft    Service-Oriented Address Assignment Using DHCPv6              
 February 2005



   This document introduces a new name space for Service-Type.  The DHC
   WG needs to identify the relevant Service Types for which IANA will
   later need to assign the codes.
