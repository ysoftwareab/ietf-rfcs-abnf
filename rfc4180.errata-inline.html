1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   &quot;text/tab-separated-values&quot; type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the &quot;text/csv&quot; MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional &quot;header&quot; parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;bbb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot; CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;b CRLF
       bb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot; CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;b&quot;&quot;bb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot;

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the &quot;text&quot; tree may be used in conjunction with the
      &quot;charset&quot; parameter.

      The &quot;header&quot; parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are &quot;present&quot; or &quot;absent&quot;.
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should &quot;be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others&quot; (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional &quot;header&quot;
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single &quot;master&quot; specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered the MIME type &quot;text/csv&quot; using the
   application provided in Section 3 of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

<div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid5714'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5714'>EID 5714</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 5, 6

<b>Original Text:</b>

Section 5: 
  &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;bbb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot; CRLF
Section 6: 
  &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;b CRLF
  bb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot; CRLF
  zzz,yyy,xxx

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

Section 5:
  &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;bbb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot;CRLF
Section 6:
  &quot;aaa&quot;,&quot;b CRLF
  bb&quot;,&quot;ccc&quot;CRLF
  zzz,yyy,xxx
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
As implied in the ABNF grammar, escaped (quoted) fields may not be followed by a space.<br/>The corrected text removes those spaces from the examples, making them syntactically correct.
