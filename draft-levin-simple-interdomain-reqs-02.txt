1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

2.  Introduction

   With increased adoption of SIP and SIMPLE based presence and instant
   messaging systems, it becomes more important to specify a uniform
   profile these systems will use to exchange presence information and
   instant messages (IMs) and to document best current practices
   regarding security and "good citizenship" behavior that operators
   should use when interconnecting SIP/SIMPLE clouds.

   The purpose of this document is not to become a normative profile but
   rather to serve as the reference for the SIP/SIMPLE deployers
   community towards inter-domain interoperability and also to identify
   new requirements specific to the inter-domain interface.

   The document is structured into the following main sections:
   o  Topology and Architecture
   o  Connecting Communities via SIP/SIMPLE
   o  Presence
   o  Instant Messaging
   o  Interconnecting Policy
   o  SIP Miscellaneous
   o  Requirements for Standard Extensions

3.  Topology and Architecture

   For the purposes of this document, we consider users as "belonging"
   to a given SIP/SIMPLE presence and messaging community.  A SIP/SIMPLE
   community administers its own namespace of SIP addresses or has other
   administrative authority over a collection of users and/or SIP/SIMPLE
   endpoints.  The users of an enterprise, the subscribers of a mobiler
   operator, or the customers of a given service provider are examples
   of such communities.  A typical deployment topology illustrating how
   two SIP/SIMPLE communities might interconnect is shown in the figure
   below.

          /U-A                                                     /U-B

   The edge proxies (EP-A and EP-B) for a given community are SIP
   proxies that have both ability and authority to route traffic from
   the public network to the SIP entities within that community.  Each
   edge proxy is said to "service", "be responsible for", "act on behalf
   of", or be "in" a community, which is to say that the edge proxy
   listens for requests intended for a given community (identified by
   its domain), routes the SIP traffic "to" and "from" the community,
   and in some cases provides answers on behalf of the users and
   entities within that community.

   The other components shown in the picture are logical SIP/SIMPLE
   entities internal to each community that participate in different
   aspects of presence and IM.  They include UAs/PUAs (U-A and U-B),
   Registrars (R-A and R-B), and Presence Servers (P-A and P-B).

   This document is concerned with the protocols and deployment
   considerations of the "inter-domain interface" between two separately
   administered SIP clouds.  Put another way, the inter-domain interface
   is the path between EP-A and EP-B, where traffic can traverse any
   communication transport layer pertaining SIP/SIMPLE (e.g.  VPN for
   trusted domains).  This path may optionally include a chain of SIP
   proxies for application routing in-between.

4.  Connecting SIP/SIMPLE Communities

4.1  Configuration and Discovery

   When a user in a given SIP/SIMPLE community wishes to communicate
   with users in a different community, a route must exist between the
   sender's edge proxy (EP-A) and that of the destination (EP-B).  To
   establish this route, an edge proxy needs to learn the Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of its peer proxy by means out-of-band
   to SIP.



Levin, et al.            Expires August 25, 2005                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


   One means of discovery is the use DNS SRV records according to the
   procedures in RFC-3263 [5].  However, some communities may wish to
   implement more restrictive policy concerning other communities to
   whom their users may communicate.  Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED
   that local edge proxies have the ability to be statically provisioned
   with the list of valid DNS domains to which they may connect.  These
   are the DNS domains that the remote edge proxy has the authority and
   the ability to route to.

4.2  Connection Management

   Connections between presence and messaging communities SHOULD use
   reliable and congestion safe connection for transport.  These
   connections are bi-directional, semi-persistent, and are established
   on-demand by either edge proxy.

   For large communities many thousands or millions of dialogs may be
   occurring concurrently.  Consequently, it would likely not be
   appropriate for a community to establish one connection per SIP
   dialog.

   Data for multiple SIP dialogs can and will likely flow across a given
   connection.  Conversely, the requests and responses that make up a
   given dialog may flow over any active connection that exists between
   the two SIP/SIMPLE communities and is not guaranteed to flow over the
   same connection as preceding requests.  If a connection fails or
   closed by either side due to a locally defined inactivity period or
   policy, each side can initiate new TLS connection(s) at any time.

   Although SIP/SIMPLE communities may establish more than one
   connection to communicate with other, in consideration of
   scalability, implementers are RECOMMENDED to limit the number of such
   connections to a reasonably small number.  In any event, the
   receiving community's edge proxy MAY refuse to accept more than a
   given number of connections from a given edge proxy or from all of
   the edge proxies that reside within a given community.

4.3  Transport Security

   In order to prevent spoofing, provide better control against spam,
   and allow privacy and secured transport, communities MAY require the
   use of a secured transport layer.  This could be achieved by using
   IPSec or mutually authenticated TLS connection between the edge
   proxies.  The secure connectivity SHOULD be agreed by a bilateral
   offline agreement.  If both edge proxies are in a joint secure area,
   it is possible to use TCP without secure transport measures.

   According to the TLS protocol RFC-2246 [2], for establishment of the



Levin, et al.            Expires August 25, 2005                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


   mutually authenticated TLS connection, each server needs to present a
   valid certificate to the other server.  Each server also needs to
   trust the certificate authority that issued the certificate presented
   by the other proxy or trust the certificate itself.  Once a TLS
   connection is established between two edge proxies, it is trusted for
   the life of the connection as long as the certificate is valid.  When
   using a secure transport, the edge proxy of both side act as the
   security UA, leaving the internal components from dealing with the
   transport security.

   As indicated in the preceding section, between two edge proxies, one
   or more connections can be simultaneously maintained.  If a group of
   TLS connections is maintained between the two edge proxies, the same
   certificate MUST be used for all connections servicing a given
   community.This allows allocation of SIP dialogs among the TLS
   connections according to local policy and without requiring
   additional protocols between the communities.

5.  Presence

5.1  SIP/SIMPLE Profile for Presence

   In order to get the presence information from a user in a different
   community, the standard SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanisms defined in
   RFC-3265 [7] and RFC-3856 [9] are used.

   An edge proxy may receive SUBSCRIBE requests for presentities that do
   not exist within the community, for example, as a result of a
   mistyped contact name or the removal of a previously valid identity
   (e.g.  enterprise user quits the company).  Some presentities may
   also be restricted by local policy from communicating across
   communities.  In these cases, the receiving community SHOULD reject
   the session by issuing one of the 4XX responses (e.g.  "404 Not
   found" or "403 Forbidden") to SUBSCRIBE.  If one of the 4XX responses
   is generated, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that the originating
   community does not automatically (i.e.  without user intervention)
   retries the same SUBSCRIBE request again.

   A receiving edge proxy MAY alternately accept the SUBSCRIBE using a
   2xx response and indicate in a subsequent NOTIFY that the presentity
   is not available (i.e.  has "closed" status).  A given community may
   wish to do this in order to prevent dictionary attacks to harvest
   valid presentity addresses.

5.2  Presence Format

   The basic presence format used between users in different communities
   is defined by Presence Information Data Format [10].  This standard



Levin, et al.            Expires August 25, 2005                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


   format is signaled by including the "Accept" header with
   "application/pidf+xml" in the SUBSCRIBE as (at least) one of the
   possible presence formats the watcher understands.

   Any additional presence information MAY be exchanged over the
   inter-domain interface if encoded according to standard XML extension
   techniques.  It is expected that the following additional standard
   user information is especially useful to be conveyed between
   SIP/SIMPLE communities:
   o  "activity" element defined in Rich Presence Extensions [12].
   o  "icon" element defined in Contact Information [13].
   o  "display-name" element defined in Contact Information [13].

   A PUA MUST be capable of receiving any XML extended schema, compliant
   with the standard, and gracefully ignore any extensions it doesn't
   understand.

   An example of a valid presence document is shown below:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
                   xmlns:es="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-status"
                   xmlns:ci="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid"
          entity="sip:t-jones@example.com">
           <tuple id="0">
             <status>
               <basic>open</basic>
        	     <es:activities>
               <es:activity>on-the-phone</es:activity>
   	     </es:activities>
             </status>
             <contact>sip:tom-pc@example.com</contact>
           </tuple>
           <ci:display-name>Tom Jones</ci:display-name>
         </presence>



5.3  Automatic Periodic Presence Operations

   Some SIP/SIMPLE communities may reassert subscription requests or
   presence notifications without user intervention in order to provide
   a form of self-repair or to update stale data.

5.3.1  Ensuring User Validity

   An edge proxy MAY automatically periodically generate re-SUBSCRIBEs
   towards an external SIP/SIMPLE community (for example, in order to



Levin, et al.            Expires August 25, 2005                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


   ensure contact accuracy).  In the absence of any bilateral agreement
   between the administrative authorities for each community,
   subscriptions to the same URI MUST NOT occur more frequently than
   every two hours.

5.3.2  Ensuring Presence Validity

   An entity within a SIP/SIMPLE community MAY automatically
   periodically generate NOTIFYs towards an external SIP/SIMPLE
   community.  In the absence of any bilateral agreement between the
   administrative authorities for each community, data refreshes within
   the same SUBSCRIBE dialog MUST NOT occur more frequently than every
   10 minutes.  This limitation doesn't apply to notifications about
   dynamic changes in users' state (for example, a user transitioning
   from an "open" to "closed" state).

6.  Instant Messaging (IM)

6.1  General

   At the time of this writing, two major modes of IM are being used in
   networks: Page mode and Session mode.

   It is expected that the two modes will coexist in the future
   side-by-side in the same network: each mode optimized for and being
   used by different applications and potentially resulting in different
   user experiences.

   It is strongly RECOMMENDED that upon receiving a request to initiate
   a specific IM mode, if the requested UA either doesn't support the
   mode or is not willing to communicate by it, the UA responds with
   "488 Not Acceptable Here" with Warning header field value explaining
   why the offer was rejected and expressing the alternative IM mode by
   including its capabilities as specified in section 11.1 and 21.4.26
   of RFC-3261 [4] and as shown for each mode specifically in the
   sections below.

   Since the Page mode is prevalent today, in case any IM mode is
   applicable to the originating application, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   application starts with the Page mode and, if rejected, retries with
   the session mode if it has been expressed in the capabilities of the
   remote application.

   Before establishing IM communications towards a remote UA, a UA MAY
   query its peer's IM capabilities using the SIP OPTIONS request
   specified in RFC-3261 [4].

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


6.2  Page IM

   The Page mode IM is fully specified in RFC-3428 [8].

   A UA that is willing to communicate using the page mode IM, responds
   to the OPTIONS request by including the Allow header with listing the
   MESSAGE as one of the methods it supports as shown in the example
   below:

         SIP/2.0 200 OK
         Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bKhjhs8ass877
          ;received=192.0.2.4
         To: <sip:carol@chicago.com>;tag=93810874
         From: Alice <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;tag=1928301774
         Call-ID: a84b4c76e66710
         CSeq: 63104 OPTIONS
         Contact: <sip:carol@chicago.com>
         Contact: <mailto:carol@chicago.com>
         Allow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, MESSAGE
         Accept: application/sdp
         Supported: foo
         Content-Type: application/sdp
         Content-Length: 274

         (SDP not shown)


   As described for presence, above, an edge proxy may receive MESSAGE
   requests for IM addresses that do not exist within the community or
   are restricted by local policy from communicating with other
   communities.  In these cases, the receiving community SHOULD return a
   4XX response (e.g.  "404 Not found" or "403 Forbidden") to MESSAGE.
   If one of the 4XX responses is generated, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
   that the originating UA refrains from issuing additional MESSAGE
   requests within a reasonable timeframe.  A receiving community MAY
   alternately return a 2xx response and fail to deliver the message.  A
   given community may wish to do this in order to prevent dictionary
   attacks to harvest valid IM addresses.

6.3  Session IM

6.3.1  MSRP

   At the time of this writing, the Message Sessions Relay Protocol
   (MSRP) [11] is under definition.  Once it is standardized, it will
   become a valid IM means over inter-domain links.

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


6.3.2  MESSAGE inside INVITE Session

   At the time of this writing, the only deployed session IM is the
   MESSAGE SIP method being sent inside INVITE SIP dialog.  This is one
   of the possible behaviors described in Section 2 of RFC-3428 [8] and
   the ideas from the draft-ietf-simple-im-sdp-00 "Extensions for SIP
   Instant Message Sessions" by B.  Campbell and J.  Rosenberg from July
   13th 2001.  This mode has never been fully standardized.

   Concerns about streaming data inside the signaling path have been
   expressed in the past.  Most objections were related to the SIP
   ability running over UDP.  As this document recommends the use of TLS
   or TCP, "MESSAGE inside INVITE Session" mode can be used with proper
   data flow control for potentially significant traffic inside the SIP
   signaling path.

   The SIP session is established according to SIP RFC-3261 [4] and SDP
   "Offer-Answer Model" RFC-3264 [6] procedures.

   In order to establish the IM session, a client issues SIP INVITE with
   the SDP body containing (at least) the following m-line:

   m=message 5060 sip <SIP URI>

   The "SIP URI" SHOULD be the value from the Contact header and MAY be
   omitted.

   The consequent MESSAGE methods RFC-3428 [8] are constructed and sent
   according to standard SIP rules for messages inside a SIP dialog as
   defined in section 12.2 of RFC-3261 [4].

   The recipient's UA MUST ignore any headers and parameters in the
   MESSAGE that it doesn't understand.

   The recipient's UA MUST ignore any attributes and parameters in the
   SDP document that it doesn't understand.

   The recipient UA MUST reject all m-lines in the SDP document that it
   doesn't understand or doesn't support by using the standard SDP
   convention (i.e.  by setting the "port" parameter in the m-line to
   "0").

   The recipient's UA MUST ignore all INFO messages RFC-2976 [3] that it
   doesn't understand.

   A UA that is willing to communicate using the MESSAGE method inside
   SIP session, includes an SDP document with

   m=message 5060 sip <SIP URI>

   when responding to OPTIONS and in "488 Not Acceptable Here" responses
   in the SDP format defined in section 9 of "Offer-Answer Model"
   RFC-3264 [6].

7.  SIP Miscellaneous

   SIP public proxies (i.e.  those proxies through which a SIP message
   transits between edge proxies of SIP/SIMPLE communities) SHOULD
   preserve all SIP headers and parameters they don't understand.

   If the accumulated length of Record Route headers in incoming (from
   an inter-domain link) SIP request exceeds the local policy of the
   receiving community, the recipient SHOULD reject the session by
   responding with "513 Message Too Large" to the request.

8.  Agreements

   Before connecting separately administrated SIP/SIMPLE communities,
   certain local procedures need to be implemented by each community in
   order to become a good global SIP/SIMPLE citizen.  Each community
   also SHOULD take precautions in order to defend itself (both
   reactively and proactively) from potentially badly behaving other
   communities.  This document describes a number of these best
   practices.

   However, many of these procedures are largely a matter of local
   policy and in many cases can not be enforced by communication
   protocols.  Therefore, it is expected that many of the proposed
   solutions will be referred to and enforced by bilateral business
   agreements before enabling the inter-domain connection.

   Communities that attempt to communicate with another community in the
   absence of such an agreement MUST adhere to the provisions in this
   document, particularly those referenced in the security
   considerations section, below.

9.  Requirements for Standard Extensions

   In describing the best practices and conventions for communicating
   between disparate SIP/SIMPLE communities, the authors have identified
   several additional areas worthy of potential standardization.  These
   areas are listed here for discussion; as they become formalized, they
   will be described in future versions of this document.

9.1  Recording and Logging

   For each SIP session, during the establishment and renegotiation
   phase it MUST be possible by standard means to inform the
   participants that the session is going to be recorded or logged.

   The recording or logging party, during the session establishment or
   renegotiation, MUST have a standard means to inform the session
   participants about the operation to take place.

9.2  Inter-community User Trust Level

   Each community is responsible for verifying the identities of its
   users.  As verification can take different forms, we introduce the
   concept of "user trust".  While related to authentication, user trust
   differs in that authentication provides assurance that a user with a
   given identity has provided proper credentials to authenticate
   himself into a system.  User trust verifies that the user is
   authorized to use the identity.

   For example, in a system where participants can register using email
   addresses - these addresses may be used as one form of identity
   verification.  The system may send an email message to the given
   identifier and wait for an email response to verify that the
   registrant is authorized to use the email account associated with
   that address.  In another case, a service provider may employ an
   image test or obtain a credit card number to determine that a
   registrant is a person and not a software "bot".  Accreditation
   systems may also play a role in establishing user trust.

   Because of the wide range of verification assertions (including,
   potentially the "null" assertion), and because it is possible that
   users in the same community are being verified by different means and
   are being consequently assigned a different trust level by their same
   community, it is REQUIRED that a "user trust level" be defined and
   standardized to convey this information to other trusted communities
   across the inter-domain link.  The scope of "user trust level"
   terminology should cover presence exchange, call establishment, and
   page IM communications.

   Over the inter-domain link, it MUST be possible to convey per user
   the level of the "user trust" as considered by its own community.
   For communities that implement a single level trust policy across
   their users, the edge proxies MAY provide this indication.  If the
   indication is not present, the federated users MAY be regarded as
   "non-trusted" by other communities.

   This technique will allow providing between good to decent user

   experience depending on the trust level of a watcher or of a
   communications' requestor.

9.3  Add/Remove Contact

   In the event a user is removed from its SIP/SIMPLE community, it MUST
   be possible (though not required) for the community to communicate
   this removal to the presentity's known watchers in external
   communities using standard means.

   Some communities require a watcher to obtain consent from a
   presentity before establishing a presence subscription, or to obtain
   consent from the recipient before a message can be sent.  In order to
   support these kinds of communities, it MUST be possible for users to
   request these kinds of consent without actually establishing
   communication (i.e., without establishing a presence subscription or
   sending a message).

   This consent request will allow the recipient to validate the
   requesting user and consider adding him/her to the contact list
   and/or accept communications and result in a better user experience
   for interacting with initially non-trusted users.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a number of requirements and best practices
   for interconnecting distinctly administered SIP/SIMPLE communities
   for the purpose of exchanging presence and instant messages.  Because
   these inter-domain connections traverse the public Internet, it is
   especially important to be conscious of security in order to preserve
   user privacy and to take into account scalability and operational
   requirements for the network.

   In that vein, this entire document describes a number of practices
   that directly or indirectly relate to security, but in particular,
   section "Mutual TLS" describes specific tactics meant to defend
   against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, and to provide
   for data integrity and other protections.  Other sections describe
   conventions and techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk of
   DOS attacks and to prevent undue traffic over the network.

   It is important to note that this document primarily describes the
   interactions that take place over the inter-domain interface.
   Because these inter-domain connections exist between edge proxies and
   not directly between end-user UAs, issues surrounding the
   authentication of UAs internally or of securing intra-community
   traffic are considered out of scope.  Nonetheless, each community is
   assumed to be responsible for its own internal security, and edge

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


   proxies are explicitly assumed to be authoritative and responsible
   for traffic originating within a community.

10.1  Spam Prevention

   Given the prevalence of spam in other communications media, it
   deserves special consideration.  Spam is defined in this case as
   unsolicited presence requests and instant messaging traffic and sent
   from an inter-domain link to a recipient unwilling to process this
   traffic.

   The SIP and Spam [14] document discusses many techniques that can be
   used to reduce spam with their advantages and disadvantages.

   This document concentrates on technologies that are deployable today
   and the techniques applicable to the multi-domain topology with SIP
   edge proxies on the borders of each domain or community.  Because
   edge proxies (and the intermediate proxies, if deployed) are
   interconnected using mutually authenticated TLS links, the
   fundamental trust model for parties in the network can be reliably
   maintained.

   Each community is assumed to be responsible for taking measures to
   prevent its own users from generating spam.  Each community is also
   responsible for preventing unauthorized access that would allow a
   malicious third party to gain access to the network for the purpose
   of sending spam.  These techniques are considered out of scope of
   this document.

   Each community SHOULD have mechanisms in place to disable its own
   users that are injecting spam into the inter-domain interface.  Most
   efficiently, this can be achieved by toughening the white list local
   policies around federated users based on the user's perceived trust
   level.  The specifics of these local policies are out of scope of
   this document.

   A receiving community's edge proxy SHOULD take into account factors
   such as the calling party's User Trust Level (section 9.2), the
   number of instant messages received from a given sender or community
   (either to a single recipient or aggregated across all users in a
   community), or using any of the other techniques listed in [14].  The
   receiving proxy MAY reject or close connections, provide degraded
   service, or employ other local policy to deal with these attacks.

10.2  Federated Contacts Accuracy

   An additional issue that occurs with inter-community presence is that
   presence subscriptions are typically long-lived and are identified



Levin, et al.            Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Inter-domain Profile for SIP/SIMPLE     February 2005


   only with a SIP "Address of Record" (AoR).  If a principal leaves a
   community and is subsequently replaced by another principal having
   the same address as the departed principal, the new principal may
   receive messages for, or be exposing presence to, entities that are
   trying to communicate with the previous principal.

   Therefore, for inter-community communications, it is REQUIRED that
   the communities not reassign a removed user AoR to a new user for at
   least 90 days after the old user was removed from the community.

   In order to ensure the validity of a user's contact lists and ACLs,
   it is strongly RECOMMENDED that the network services periodically
   re-SUBSCRIBE to all external contacts in the lists at least every 45
   days.  The availability of the ability to convey Add/Remove contact
   information (section 9.3) may also provide assistance in this regard.
