              SDCP: Streaming Distributed Control Protocol
                      draft-perez-dispatch-sdcp-01

Abstract

   This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia
   streaming in cases where streaming generation should be distributed
   to improve performance.  This is especially useful for Human-Things
   streams.  Usually, real time applications such as virtual reality
   generate a user-controlled multimedia streaming.  This is a time
   continuous data flux that could be divided spatially or temporally to
   distribute processing, memory or network resources.  This protocol
   does not describe streaming communication, but the control of each
   single streaming generation in a best-effort by many nodes or things.

1.  Introduction

   The amount of information transmitted from human-to-computer (H2C) is
   usually very small.  This is the case of information generated by
   input devices, for example, keyboards, mouses or touch screens.
   Conversely, the amount of information transmitted from computer-to-
   human (C2H) is huge which is increasing over time.  This is the case
   of information generated for output devices, such as computer
   monitors, mobile phone screens or virtual reality headsets.
   Furthermore, the hardware resources such as data processing, network
   bandwidth or storage are also considerable.  H2C control data is
   required to generate C2H data, such as virtual reality and other
   applications.  In this way, H2C control data may be sending to many
   nodes in multicast method by best-effort delivery and processing.
   The protocol has been implemented by [Perez-Monte14] with good
   results and its has been descripted in detail by [Perez-Monte16].

Internet-Draft                    SDCP                      January 2017


   Streaming Distributed Control Protocol (SDCP) is an application-level
   protocol for control of streaming distributed generation.  SDCP is
   built over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] or the
   Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) [RFC3828], which
   provides a connection less deterministic transport mechanism.  SDCP
   provides the complete information for suitable streaming distributed
   generation.  Other mechanism have been specified to transmit
   multimedia streaming, including the Real Time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326].  The SDCP is not meant to displace this mechanism
   but rather complement it.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Some clarifications and additional definitions follow:

   o  Multimedia Streaming: It is a group of successive multimedia real-
      time data blocks over time.  A real-time data block can be an
      audio level for multimedia audio streaming or a frame for
      multimedia video streaming.  Successive blocks of multimedia
      streaming must be ordered in time.

   o  Data Block (DB): Data portion of stream with the same shared time
      slot.

   o  Spatial Data Segment (SDS): Spatial Data segment is subdivision or
      partition of each Data block to distributed generation.  These
      fragments could be a piece of a render image.

   o  Processor nodes: These nodes generate the multimedia streaming
      under a distributed scheme.

   o  Administrator Node: This node controls multimedia streaming
      generation by periodically sending streaming control to the
      processor nodes.

   o  Integrator node: This node receives multimedia streaming from
      Processor nodes to display this to a human receptor.

   Integrator and Administrator nodes are the human-side and Processor
   nodes are the things-side of the communication system.

                                 Figure 1

   Administrator Node sends periodically SDCP multicast control
   datagrams to Processor Nodes.  The use of multicast is mandatory to
   select processor group ID.  The amount of SDCP datagrams should be
   sufficient to compensate losses and to allow real-time operation.
   These losses may occur by delivery problems or it could be ignored
   datagrams by processor nodes.  Administrator Node MAY assign
   different Processor Node for processing each SDS.

   Each unoccupied Processor Node receive SDCP datagrams.  Occupied
   Processor Node SHOULD ignore SDCP datagrams.  Each Processor Node
   generates stream portion through the use of more current SDCP control
   data.  This generated stream is sent to an appropriate Integrator
   Node.

   Integrator Node receives stream portion unicast communication.  All
   the stream portion received are integrated in a single stream that is
   sent to remote human receptors or locally visualized.

   Administrator Node MAY assign different destination Integrator Node
   for each SDS.  Each integrator node MAY receive multiple streams, a
   same DB or multiple/single SDS of multiple Processor Node.  However,
   each SDS is assigned to only one Integrator node.  While that
   different SDS of same stream MAY be assigned to send these to
   different integrator nodes, each SDS of same stream MUST NOT be sent
   to more than only one Integrator node.

   Processor Node or Processor Node Group 64 bit ID is determined by
   multicast destination address of IP stack.

   Control data type: 8-bit selector.  Type of control streaming
   generation data.  Types are defined in accordance with specific
   requirement of application.  E.g. virtual reality, game or video
   streaming, drone controller application, etc.

   Control data mode: 1-bit selector.  Instant or Historical Mode.

   0 - Instant Mode: The payload has the last control data configuration
   for the Processor Nodes, which means that the Administrator Node
   sends control data in a deterministic way with the last setup.

   1 - Historical Mode: Administrator Node sends previous and actual
   control data to the processor nodes, in order to help them to
   generate the next streaming sequence.

   RD: 3-bit selector.  Reserved for future use.

   Streaming Generation Source ID: 20-bit unsigned integer.  Multimedia
   generation data source identification.  It identifies the data source
   generating multimedia stream.

   Timestamp: 64-bits unsigned fixed-point.  It includes a 32-bit
   unsigned seconds field spanning 136 years and a 32-bit fraction field
   resolving 232 picoseconds such as RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  This 64-bit
   timestamp format is used in General DB header and payload.

   SDCP Counter: 32-bit unsigned integer.  Total number of SDCP
   datagrams sent.

   Var DB Counter: 32-bit unsigned integer.  Total number of SDCP
   datagrams sent with control data changes.

   DB size: 32-bit unsigned integer.

   SDS size: 32-bit unsigned integer.

   Next Header Counter: 16-bit unsigned integer.  Number of Optional SDS
   Headers.  Length of optional headers in 16-octet units.

4.2.  Specific SDS Header

   SDS header is optional.  This header specifies SDS allocation to
   nodes.  Two functions are defined.  On the one hand, this header MAY
   determine which SDS data are assigned to generate by processor node.
   On the other hand, this header MAY determine which SDS data are
   assigned to send from processor node to integrator node.  Each unique
   64 bit id can identify a node, node group and node role or SDS data
   task or SDS data task group.  The node roles are processor,
   integrator and administrator but others roles can be defined.

   SDS task ID: 64-bit selector.  It identifies individual SDS task or
   SDS group tasks for allocation to nodes.  The tasks already assigned
   to a node can also assigned to other node by setting SDS task ID with
   its node ID.

   Resource ID: 64-bit selector, identifies integrator or processor node
   from its interface identifier from IPv6 unicast destination address
   or identifies processor node group from its low-order 64 bits of an
   IPv6 multicast destination address such as IP Version 6 Addressing
   Architecture [RFC2373].  Allocated Processor Node MUST process all
   SDS assigned in SDS group ID and MUST NOT process SDS not assigned.
   Non-allocated Processor Node MAY process all SDS.  SDS not assigned
   to any Integrator Node MUST be sent to Default Integrator Node.
   Similarly, SDS assigned more than one Integrator Node MUST be sent
   only to Default Integrator Node.

4.3.  Payload

   Payload data format is specified in control data type field of
   general header.  This field determines in virtual reality
   applications variables such as camera positions, light positions,
