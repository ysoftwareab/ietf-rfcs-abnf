Abstract

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP-for-IPv4) option that provides two lists of configuration data
   for nodes that implement the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
   Protocol (ISATAP).

1. Introduction

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP-for-IPv4) option for the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
   Protocol (ISATAP) [1]. The option encodes two lists; the site's
   Potential Router List (PRL) ([1], section 7.3.1) and the list of
   DHCPv6 [2] servers for the site. The option is similar to the one

   specified in RFC 3361 [3] and allows ISATAP site administrators to
   publish the site's PRL and DHCPv6 server lists as zero or more domain
   names or IPv4 addresses.

2. ISATAP DHCP Option

   The ISATAP DHCP option carries two lists. Each list may contain zero
   or more 32-bit IPv4 addresses or DNS (RFC 1035 [4]) fully-qualified
   domain names (FQDNs). The elements in each list MUST NOT include a
   mix of IPv4 addresses and FQDNs; instead, the data type for each list
   is identified by an 'enc' byte in the DHCP option. The ISATAP DHCP
   option has the following format:

    Code   len   enc      Potential Router List
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD |  m  |  x  |  p1 |  p2 |  p3 |  p4 | p5  | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
     ... |  n  |  y  |  d1 |  d2 |  d3 |  d4 | d5  | ...
      ---+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
     ... | len   enc        DHCPv6 Server List
      ---+

   As can be seen in the figure, the ISATAP DHCP option encodes 'm'
   octets of Potential Router List entries of encoding type 'x' followed
   by 'n' octets of DHCPv6 Server List entires of encoding type 'y'.

   When an 'enc' byte has a value of 0, the list contains a sequence of
   zero or more labels comprising FQDNs encoded exactly as specified in
   ([3], section 3.1). When an 'enc' byte has a value of 1, the list
   contains zero or more IPv4 addresses encoded exactly as specified in
   ([3], section 3.2). The 'len' and 'enc' fields for both the Potential
   Router List and DHCPv6 Server List are always present (i.e., even if
   one or both lists are empty).

   ISATAP nodes use the elements encoded in the Potential Router List
   exactly as specified in ([1], section 7.3.1).

   When the elements encoded in the DHCPv6 Server List are IPv4
   addresses, they are used by ISATAP nodes to construct link-local
   ISATAP addresses exactly as specified in ([1], section 5.1). When the
   elements encoded in the DHCPv6 Server List are FQDNs, they are used
   by ISATAP nodes in DNS queries to obtain IPv4 addresses for
   link-local ISATAP address construction as specified above.

3. IANA considerations

   The DHCPv4 option number for ISATAP is TBD.
