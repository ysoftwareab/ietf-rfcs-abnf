1.  Introduction

   Packet networks are evolving from bandwidth-guaranteed Quality of
   Service (QoS) to latency-guaranteed QoS that guarantees bounded
   latency and definite latency.  Bounded latency and definite latency
   can be further understood as in-time delivery, in which a packet
   arrives without exceeding a predetermined time, and on-time delivery,
   in which a packet arrives at a predetermined time, respectively.  In
   addition, network survivability, which typically guarantees traffic
   recovery within 50 ms in the event of a network failure, is evolving
   to a level that guarantees lossless recovery.  In order to realize
   the evolution of QoS and network survivability of these networks,
   Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology and Deterministic
   Networking (DetNet) technology are considered to be essential.

   TSN is a set of standards developed by the IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group
   (TG) [IEEE802.1TSN] and specifies mechanisms and protocols necessary
   to realize highly available IEEE 802.1 networks with bounded latency
   to carry time-sensitive, real-time application traffic.

   DetNet, of which architecture is defined in RFC 8655 [RFC8655],
   provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data
   flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates
   and bounded latency within a network domain.  Various documents on
   data planes and their interworking technologies to extend the service
   range of data that TSN intends to deliver to the IP (Internet
   Protocol) and MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) networks have
   been standardized.

   Since TSN and DetNet were proposed, application use cases have always
   been one of the hottest topics.  As documented in RFC 8578 [RFC8578],
   the scope of networks addressed by the current DetNet is limited to
   networks that can be centrally controlled, i.e., an "enterprise" (aka
   "corporate") network, excluding "the open Internet," explicitly.
   After years of development, TSN has been used in several industries,
   and has enough public awareness of the industry for its scope.
   DetNet also has done a lot of work and the standards are mature, and
   people become concerned about how to meet deterministic service
   demand in large-scale networks.  The current DetNet is limited to a
   single administrative domain network, and there are technical
   elements necessary for application to a large-scale network spanning
   multiple domains.

   This document describes requirements for large-scale deterministic
   networks where different deterministic levels of applications co-
   exist and large-scale deterministic networking across multiple
   administrative domains is possible.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   While [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] describe interpretations of these key
   words in terms of protocol specifications and implementations, they
   are used in this document to describe technical and operational
   requirements to realize large-scale deterministic networks.

3.  The Overall Characteristics of Large-Scale Deterministic Networks

   When deterministic network services are introduced, network providers
   always face the problem of how to match application needs to the
   technology, so more works are needed for network service providers to
   successfully sell DetNet type services to customers.  The providers
   are in need of the following:

   Service level objective definitions, considering absolute or relative
   latency and jitter bounds, flows types and physical network scale

   Suitable queuing mechanisms, considering more options for queuing
   mechanisms for different service level, and

   Deployment strategies, considering how to integrate into existing
   networks, service, and control plane.

   [RFC8578]provides various use cases and their requirements in the
   areas of industry, electricity, buildings, etc.  Some of them clearly
   specify the requirements for latency and jitter, while some others do
   not for the jitter.  Different types of users have different demands,
   just as a network provider provides different network services for
   personal business or enterprise business.

   One kind has critical SLA requirement, such as remote control or
   cloud Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) of manufacturing and
   differential protection of electricity.  If these services exceed the
   boundaries of latency and jitter, it will bring property losses and
   security risks, so they cannot tolerate with any non-deterministic
   situation and can pay more on the network service.

   Another kind has relatively lower levels of SLA requirement, such as
   cloud gaming, cloud VR and online meeting for "consumer" networks.
   The users of these applications hope to have a better network
   experience, but they can tolerate it to a certain extent.  If the

   network quality is not good sometime, they might be willing to spend
   more money for high-quality network services.  In some aspects,
   because such services have no industry barriers and can tolerate
   exceeding the upper boundary of latency within a small probability,
   they have relatively lower requirements for the network and may be
   easier to deploy.

   Different application demands are actually related to cost.  For
   strict deterministic services, strict technologies need to be used,
   and all network devices may need to be upgraded.  For non-strict
   deterministic services, it may only be necessary to upgrade some
   network devices (maybe edge nodes) or share corresponding network
   resources.  From the perspective of deployment, it is helpful if
   there is a clear classification of application demands, including
   latency, jitter, reliability, etc.  In this way, the corresponding
   technology to implement could be chosen, taking into account both
   performance and cost, but how to make choice is not within the scope
   of this document.

                    Critical latency requirements:

        |      <->| Industrial, tight jitter, hard latency limit
        |<------->| Industrial, hard latency limit
        |
        |<-------------.....>  Relatively lower latency requirements

4.  Technical Requirements in Large-Scale Deterministic Networks

   Due to the different kinds of application requirements in large-scale
   networks, the corresponding technical requirements should be
   considered.

4.1.  Tolerate Time Asynchrony

4.1.1.  Support Asynchronous Clocks Across Domains

   A large-scale network may span over multiple networks with one or
   more administrators.  One of DetNet's objectives is to stitch TSN
   islands together.  All devices inside a TSN domain are time-
   synchronized, and most of TSN technologies rely on precise time
   synchronization[IEEE802.1Qbv][IEEE802.1Qch][IEEE802.1Qav]However,
   different TSN islands may have different clocks which are not
   synchronized as shown in Figure 2, where the time difference of two
   TSN domains is D.  DetNet needs to connect these two TSN domains
   together and provide end-to-end deterministic latency service.  The
   mechanism adopted by a large-scale deterministic network MUST support
   the interaction across time domains, so that time domains are
   synchronized.  This can be done, for example, by putting extra buffer
   space at the ingress of a new domain, increasing the dead time as a
   guard band, or using some timing compensation mechanism.  This
   document does not intend to list all the potential ways.

4.1.2.  Tolerate Clock Jitter & Wander within a Clock Synchronous Domain

   Within a single time synchronization domain, different clock accuracy
   is expected, for example the crystal oscillator in Ethernet is
   specified at 100 ppm[Fast-Ethernet-MII-clock], Synchronous Ethernet
   (SyncE) can achieve 50 ppb[G.8262], and more precise time
   synchronization[G.8273] is expected in 5G mobile backhaul.  The
   clocks experience different jitter and wander.  It may cause
   different level of asymmetry of the path.  The large-scale networks
   SHOULD be able to recover or absorb such time variance within a
   domain and across multiple domains.

Internet-Draft          Deterministic Networking           February 2022


4.1.3.  Provide Mechanisms not Requiring Full Time Synchronization

   Some networks like mobile backhaul use frequency synchronization,
   such as SyncE, instead of the strict time synchronization.  It is
   usually hard to achieve the full time synchronization in large-scale
   networks when considering the size of the network topology.  It is
   desired that the same deterministic performance in term of the
   bounded latency and jitter SHOULD be achieved when full time
   synchronization is not available, that is to say, when only partial
   synchronization (SyncE is one of the examples) is in use.

4.1.4.  Support Asynchronization based Methods

   There are a large number of traffic flows in a large-scale network
   and some of them are acyclic.  Asynchronization based methods can
   meet the requirements of those traffic flows.  Moreover, The
   mechanisms not requiring the time and/or frequency synchronization
   eliminate the hardware cost and difficulty at the network
   nodes.[IEEE802.1Qcr] conceptually uses per-flow based asynchronous
   shaper to achieve bounded latency.  The formula proof shows its
   effectiveness.  It can naturally tolerate the time variance, but it
   exhibits the concerns of per-flow state buffer management as shown
   in[I-D.eckert-detnet-bounded-latency-problems]When it is in use, the
   requirement in Section 4.3 SHOULD be carefully met.

4.2.  Support Large Single-hop Propagation Latency

   In a large-scale network, a single hop distance is enough to generate
   large latency.  The speed of optical transmission in fiber is 200 km/
   ms.  Thus, the propagation delay of a single hop can be in the order
   of a few milliseconds.  It is much greater than that of a LAN, and
   introduces impacts on queuing mechanisms, such as cyclic or time
   aware scheduling method.

   For a cyclic based method, suppose a large-scale network wants to
   keep using the simple cycle mapping relationship, however the link
   distance between two nodes is longer.  Moreover, a downstream node
   may have many upstream nodes each with different link propagation
   delays (e.g., 9 us, 10 us, 11 us, 15 us and 20 us).  In order to
   absorb the longest link propagation delay, the length of cycle must
   be set to at least 20 us.  However, since packet's arrival time
   varies within the receiving cycle, larger cycle length means larger
   delay variance.

                               cyclic method

4.3.  Accommodate the Higher Link Speed

   A large-scale network normally uses higher speed links, especially
   for its backbone.  Current deterministic mechanisms used in a local
   network is usually deployed in link speed of 10 Mbps or 1 Gbps, or
   possibly 10 Gbps.  The data rate of 10G, 100G, 400G and even higher
   is commonly used in wide area networks.  With the increasing of the
   data rate, the network scheduling cycle can be reduced if the same
   amount of the data is required to be sent each cycle for each
   application.  Or more data can be sent if the network cycle time
   remains the same.  For the former, it requires the more precise time
   control (e.g. cycle in the order of a few microseconds or sub-
   microseconds) for the input stream gate and the timed output buffer.
   For the latter, more buffer space is required which imposes more
   complex buffer or queue management and larger memory consumption.

   Another aspect to consider is the aggregation of the flows.  In the
   large-scale network, the number of flows can be hundreds or tens of
   thousands.  They can be aggregated into a small number of
   deterministic path or tunnels.  It is practical to have a few flow-
   based or aggregated-flow based status in the local network.  But in
   higher speed and larger scale networks, it is hardly feasible.
   If[IEEE802.1Qcr]is in use, it requires more buffers comparing to the
   other full/partial time synchronized mechanisms.  Therefore, it
   requires optimizations to support higher link speeds.

4.4.  Be Scalable

   Comparing to a LAN, a large-scale network may have more network
   devices and traffic flows, and there is a greater possibility of
   adding or removing network devices and traffic flows.  The
   deterministic latency forwarding mechanisms MUST scale to networks of
   significant size with numerous network devices and a massive traffic
   flows.

4.4.1.  Be Scalable to Numerous Network Devices

   The increase or decrease of network devices in large-scale networks
   is more frequent than that in LANs.  The change of the number of
   devices may affect the implementation and adjustment of deterministic
   network mechanism, such as the topology discovery, queuing mechanism
   and packet replication and elimination.  A simple use case to
   understand is ultra-low-latency (public) 5G transport networks, which
   would require DetNet extend to every 5G base station.  For some
   network operators, their networks may need to connect to ~100 K base
   stations (serving multiple mobile networks operators), and this
   number will only increase with 5G.

4.4.2.  Be Scalable to Massive Traffic Flows

   It is almost impossible to identify individual IP flows at the DetNet
   data plane because of the large overhead and resource reservation for
   a massive number of flows.  DetNet allows the leverage of the flow
   aggregation.  With the large scaling of the network, proper provision
   at the control plane to accommodate such higher aggregation is
   required.  Individual flows may join and exit the aggregated flow
   rapidly which causes the dynamic in identification of the aggregated
   DetNet flow.  The wildcards and value ranges used in the
   identification may have to change in order to ensure the aggregated
   flows have compatible deterministic characteristics.

   The micro-burst will happen more often due to the massive traffic
   flows, so some methods to decrease it are

4.5.  Tolerate Failures of Links or Nodes and Topology Changes

   Network link failures are more common in large-scale networks.  Path
   switching or re-convergence of routing will cause high latency of
   packet loss and retransmission, which is usually in seconds before
   the network becomes stable again.  It is necessary to support certain
   mechanisms to adapt to failures of links or nodes and topology
   changes.

   The change of path or topology poses a higher challenge to packet
   replication and elimination.  The full disjoint paths when
   implementing the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering
   Functions (PREOF) gives a better chance of survival when one of the
   nodes or links in the path fails.  At the same time, it brings the
   challenges of finding paths with similar distance and/or number of
   hops so that there is enough buffer space to absorb the latency
   difference caused by different paths when the scale is large.

4.6.  Support Configuration of Multiple Queueing Mechanisms

   It is required to provide diversified deterministic service for
   various applications in a large-scale network and to support the
   corresponding diversified queueing mechanisms (possibly at multiple
   DetNet QoS levels).  Different queueing mechanisms can provide
   different levels of latency, jitter and other guarantees, and there
   may be situations where a network device provides multiple queueing
   mechanisms at the same time.  For example, a network aggregation
   device may use the mechanisms specified in [IEEE802.1Qbv] and
   [IEEE802.1Qcr], and other mechanisms to forward traffic to different
   paths at the same time.  By providing a variety of queueing
   mechanisms to meet diversified deterministic service Requirements,
   compared with LAN environment, this demand is particularly prominent
   in large-scale networks.  There are usually eight traffic classes in
   TSN enabled networks.  The different queueing mechanisms can be
   employed to the queues of one or more of those traffic class.  In
   practice, there may be more than eight queues or sub-queues to
   support more complicated queueing mechanisms.

   Accordingly, the configuration for multiple queueing mechanisms is
   complicated in large-scale deterministic networks and MUST support
   the unified or simplified scheduling and management of multiple queue
   mechanisms.  For example, in the distributed scenario where there is
   no controller, flooding the related information of the queue
   mechanism, including the types and related algorithms, queue
   forwarding capability, etc.  In the centralized scenario, the
   queueing mechanisms and other information could be reported to the
   controller to build a deterministic network resource topology pool
   for path calculation.

4.7.  Support Queueing Mechanisms Switchover Crossing Multi-domains

   In large-scale deterministic networks, it may across multiple network
   domains and adopt a variety of different queueing mechanisms within
   each domain.  It is required to support the inter-domain
   deterministic mechanism at the inter-domain boundary nodes such as
   the priority redefinition and rescheduling of queues to achieve the
   end-to-end latency, bounded jitter and packet loss ratio.

   Moreover, changing from one queueing mechanism to another may
   generate additional end-to-end latency and/or jitter which should be
   taken into consideration.  For example, when a flow is forwarded
   across multiple network domains based on different queueing
   mechanisms, such as a time synchronous Qbv mechanism[IEEE802.1Qbv]
   and an asynchronous Qcr mechanism [IEEE802.1Qcr], a collaboration
   mechanism crossing multi-domains MUST be considered, such as
   increasing the buffer of inter-domain devices to provide enough
   adjustment space for the flow to cross different queueing mechanisms,
   so as to provide end-to-end deterministic services across multiple
   network domains.

5.  Conclusion

   This document specifies the technical requirements when ensuring the
   deterministic features in the large-scale networks.  Some of the
   proposed queueing mechanisms are analyzed and the authors of the
   document think those proposals give reasonably sound insights to
   enhancement the current queueing mechanisms to meet the deterministic
   requirements of the large-scale networks.

Appendix A.  Examples of Large-Scale Deterministic Network Trials

   Some trials have been carried out to verify the concept of large-
   scale deterministic networks.

   In order to verify the deterministic technology of large-scale
   networks, a trial of Deterministic IP on China Environment for
   Network Innovations (CENI), which is a network built for new network
   technology trial, was deployed.  A network with a distance of 3,000
   km over 13 hops was tested, and the jitter was controlled within
   100us.

   In order to verify the remote control on Deterministic IP, which
   required that the latency should be controlled within 4 ms and jitter
   should be controlled within 20 us.  A trial cooperated with Baosteel
   spanned 600 km was deployed.  Baosteel is a Chinese steel company and
   put forward this demand.  Both of the first and second trials are
   based on a frequency synchronization solution.  The mechanism details
   could be found in . [I-D.dang-queuing-with-multiple-cyclic-buffers][I
   -D.qiang-detnet-large-scale-detnet].

   In order to realize multi flows synchronization on an inter-
   provincial network in an exhibition, Emergen proposed the requirement
   that two flows of video and virtual reality (VR) were sent from
   province A, and arrived at province B together, so people can see the
   synchronization of video collected by camera and the VR model.  This
   requirement was proposed to facilitate the virtual industry product
   deployment.  Due to time and other problems, it was realized by the
   edge network device for a relatively lower levels of service level
   agreement (SLA).

   Teaming up with a smart factory operator, network operators,
   equipment companies, and universities, ETRI demonstrated an ultra-low
   latency, high-reliability 5G wired and wireless network-based remote
   industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) service by connecting a control

   center and a smart factory through three different operators'
   networks at a distance of 280 km.  In this trail, it was demonstrated
   that real-time remote smart manufacturing service is possible by
   making round-trip delay below 3 ms within a smart factory and below
   10 ms between remote 5G industrial devices.  In the future, the team
   plans to examine feasibility of large-scale deterministic networking
   by connecting smart factories in Gyeongsan, South Korea and Oulu,
   Finland.

   These trials show that both operators and enterprise users begin to
   put forward requirements for the certainty of large-scale networks,
   but the implementation technologies are not exactly the same.
