INTERNET-DRAFT                            Diffie-Hellman Keys in the DNS


1. Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the current global hierarchical
   replicated distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail
   proxy, and similar information. The DNS has been extended to include
   digital signatures and cryptographic keys as described in RFC 2065.
   Thus the DNS can now be used for secure key distribution.

   This document describes how to store Diffie-Hellman keys in the DNS.
   Familiarity with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is assumed
   [Schneier].

   Diffie-Hellman requires two parties to interact to derive keying
   information which can then be used for authentication.  Since DNS SIG
   RRs are primarily used as stored authenticators of zone information
   for many different resolvers, no Diffie-Hellman algorithm SIG RR is
   defined. For example, assume that two parties have local secrets "i"
   and "j".  Assume they each respectively calculate X and Y as follows:

        X = g**i ( mod p )
        Y = g**j ( mod p )

   They exchange these quantities and then each calculates a Z as
   follows:

        Zi = Y**i ( mod p )
        Zj = X**j ( mod p )

   Zi and Zj will both be equal to g**(ij)(mod p) and will be a shared
   secret between the two parties that an adversary who does not know i
   or j will not be able to learn from the exchanged messages (unless
   the adversary can derive i or j by performing a discrete logarithm
   mod p which is hard for strong p and g).

   The private key for each party is their secret i (or j).  The public
   key is the pair p and g which must be the same for the parties and
   their individual X (or Y).

2. Diffie-Hellman KEY Resource Records

   Diffie-Hellman keys are stored in the DNS as KEY RRs using algorithm
   number 2.  The structure of the RDATA portion of this RR is as shown
   below.  The first 4 octets, including the flags, protocol, and
   algorithm fields are common to all KEY RRs as described in RFC 2065.
   The remainder, from prime length through public value is the "public
   key" part of the KEY RR. The period of key validity is not in the KEY
   RR but is indicated by the SIG RR(s) which signs and authenticates
   the KEY RR(s) at that domain name.

                            1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           KEY flags           |    protocol   |  algorithm=2  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     prime length (or flag)    |  prime (p) (or special)       /
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       /  prime (p)  (variable length) |       generator length        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | generator (g) (variable length)                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     public value length       | public value (variable length)/
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       /  public value (g^i mod p)    (variable length)                |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Prime length is length of the Diffie-Hellman prime (p) in bytes if it
   is 16 or greater.  Prime contains the binary representation of the
   Diffie-Hellman prime with most significant byte first.  If "prime
   length" field is 1, then the "prime" field is actually an index into
   a table of 256 predefined prime/generator pairs (Appendix A) in which
   case the generator length should be zero.  The meaning of a zero or 2
   through 15 value for "prime length" is reserved.

   Generator length is the length of the generator (g) in bytes.
   Generator is the binary representation of generator with most
   significant byte first.  PublicValueLen is the Length of the Public
   Value (g**i (mod p)) in bytes.  PublicValue is the binary
   representation of the DH public value with most significant byte
   first.

   The corresponding algorithm=2 SIG resource record is not used so no
   format for it is defined.

3. Performance Considerations

   Current DNS implementations are optimized for small transfers,
   typically less than 512 bytes including overhead.  While larger
   transfers will perform correctly and work is underway to make larger
   transfers more efficient, it is still advisable at this time to make
   reasonable efforts to minimize the size of KEY RR sets stored within
   the DNS consistent with adequate security.  Keep in mind that in a
   secure zone, an authenticating SIG RR will also be returned.



4. Security Considerations

   Many of the security consideration in RFC 2065 apply.  Of course, the
   Diffie-Hellman key stored in the DNS for an entity should not be
   trusted unless it has been obtain via a trusted DNS resolver that
   vouches for its security or unless the application using the key has
   done a similar authentication.

   In addition, the usual Diffie-Hellman key strength considerations
   apply. (p-1)/2 should also be prime, g should be primitive mod p, p
   should be "large", etc.  [Schneier]
