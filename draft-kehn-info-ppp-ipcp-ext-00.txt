Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   defines a family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing
   and configuring different network-layer protocols.  The PPP Internet
   Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) [2] defines the NCP for establishing
   and configuring the Internet Protocol (IP) [3].

   This document extends IPCP by defining the negotiation of IP route
   table entries.  This extension provides added functionality but is
   optional and preserves compatibility.

1. Introduction

   PPP is widely used by broadband service providers as the protocol of
   choice for connecting hosts to the Internet.  PPP is popular because
   it is a well-known protocol that has been utilized by dial-up service
   providers for many years.  PPP also provides per-user access control,
   billing, etc.  These later features of PPP are the most appealing to
   providers.  In recent years, PPP has seen two transport extensions
   emerge to support broadband access.  These transports are PPP over
   Ethernet (PPPoE) [5] and PPP over AAL5 (PPPoA) [6].  With the
   emergence of broadband, the PPP client is migrating from the
   subscribers PC to the broadband customer premise equipment (CPE).

   Broadband provides more bandwidth to the subscriber.  Broadband
   service providers are wanting to utilize this additional bandwidth to
   provide additional services to subscribers.  Service Providers, for
   obvious reasons, desire to isolate these additional services from
   standard Internet service.  As stated earlier, PPP provides the per-
   user access control, billing, etc.  This makes PPP a logical choice
   for providing these additional services.  PPP also allows the service
   provider to utilize its investment in networking hardware used to
   provide standard Internet access.

   If PPP is to be used for both Internet access and additional service
   access, PPP hosts (whether residing in the PC or CPE) must be able to
   establish multiple PPP links.  The presence of multiple PPP links can
   complicate packet routing decisions in the host.  This document
   proposes an extension to IPCP to address the packet routing issues
   induced in the presence of multiple PPP links.  The extension
   provides the ability to add route table entries for specific PPP
   interfaces.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [4].

3. Additional IPCP Configuration Option

3.1 Route-Add

   Description

      This configuration option defines a method for negotiating zero or
      more route table entries for the PPP interface on the local
      (client) end of the link.  If the local peer supports the Route-
      Add option, it MUST include the Route-Add option with a length of
      2 to its IPCP Configure Request.  The remote (server) peer, if it
      supports the Route-Add option, SHOULD return the appropriate

      number of Route-Add option entries in its IPCP response.  If the
      remote peer does not wish to add any route entries to the local
      peer, the remote peer MUST NOT include the Route-Add option in its
      response.  The local peer MUST accept this response as an
      indication that the remote peer does not wish to add any routes to
      the interface.

      If the remote peer does not support the Route-Add option (e.g.
      current implementations), the remote peer MAY reject the Route-Add
      option.  This is an indication to the local peer that the remote
      peer does not support the Route-Add option and IPCP negotiation
      MUST continue with out it.

      A Route-Add option entry with a Route-Address and Route-Mask of
      zero indicates a default route.

      Any routes added via the Route-Add option MUST be deleted when the
      IPCP layer terminates.

   A summary of the Route-Add option format is shown below.  The fields
   are transmitted from left to right and are in network-byte order.

   Route-Mask

      The four octet field defining the subnet mask for the route.  For
      host route entries, this field MUST be set to all one's.

   Route-Next-Hop

      The four octet field defining the route's next hop.  This field
      MAY be zero if the next hop for the route is the remote peer.

   Route-Metric

      The four octet field defining the metric value for the route.
