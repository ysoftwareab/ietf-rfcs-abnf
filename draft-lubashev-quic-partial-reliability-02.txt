                  Partially Reliable Streams for QUIC
               draft-lubashev-quic-partial-reliability-02

Abstract

   This memo introduces MIN_STREAM_DATA and EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frames
   to enable partial reliability for QUIC streams.  The
   EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame allows a sender to give up on
   retransmitting older parts of a stream and to notify the receiver
   about this decision.  The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame allows a receiver to
   express its disinterest in older parts of a stream.  The content of
   this draft is intended for merging into QUIC transport, recovery, and
   applicability drafts as a negotiable extension and/or QUIC Version 2
   transport feature.

2.  Introduction

   Some applications, especially applications with near real-time
   requirements, need transport that supports partially reliable streams
   - streams that deliver bytes in order but allow for applicaiton-
   controlled gaps.  These applications communicate using application-
   specific messages that are serialized over QUIC streams.
   Applications desire partially reliable streams when their messages

   expire and lose their usefulness due to later events (time passing,
   newer messages, etc).

   Examples of applications that can benefit from partially reliable
   streams are real time video (all prior data is to be expired when a
   new key frame is available) and data replication (expire previous
   updates, when a new update overwrites the data).

   The content of this draft is intended for [I-D.ietf-quic-transport],
   [I-D.ietf-quic-recovery] and, [I-D.ietf-quic-applicability] as a QUIC
   extension and/or QUIC Version 2.

2.1.  Stream-per-Message Alternative

   It is possible to avoid the need for partially reliable streams by
   encoding one message per QUIC stream.  When a message expires, the
   sender can reset the stream, causing RST_STREAM frame to be
   transmitted, unless all data in the stream has already been fully
   acknowledged.  Likewise, the receiver can send STOP_SENDING frame to
   indicate its disinterest in the message.  The problem with this
   approach is that messages transmitted by the application typically
   belong to a message stream, and applications may need to support
   multiple concurrent message streams.  Hence, a message-per-stream
   approach requires each message to contain an extra header portion to
   associate the message with a logical application stream.  In case of
   short messages, this approach introduces a significant overhead due
   to STREAM frames and message headers.  It also places the burden on
   the application to reorder data arriving on multiple QUIC streams.
   Furthermore, splitting each application stream into multiple QUIC
   streams renders QUIC's per-stream flow control ineffective and
   requires an application to build its own.

2.2.  Partially Reliable Streams

   The proposed single-stream mechanism keeps aplication messages
   arriving in order on a single stream, while allowing the application
   to control message expiration.  In this proposal, both the sender and
   the receiver are able to control expiration of messages in a stream.

   A feature of the proposed protocol is that data is seen by the
   receiver application at the same stream offsets used by the sender
   application.

   The key to partially reliabile streams is notifying the peer about
   data that will not or should not be retransmitted and managing flow
   control for the connection.

   To facilitate flow control, this proposal introduces a new QUIC per-
   stream value: Exempt Stream Bytes (Section 2.3).

2.3.  Exempt Stream Bytes

   Exempt Stream Bytes is the number of bytes sent on the stream that do
   not count toward connection flow control limit.  Initially, Exempt
   Stream Bytes is 0 for all streams.

2.4.  Minimum retransmittable offset and current receive offset

   For fully reliable streams, the smallest unacknowledged data offset
   is treated by the sender to be the minimum retransmittable offset.
   Likewise, the current receive offset for a stream is the smallest
   data offset that has not been received by the receiver.  Note that
   due to loss and reordering, the current receive offset may be smaller
   than the largest received offset.

   Partially reliable streams allow the sender to advance its minimum
   retransmittable offset and notify the receiver to advance its current
   receive offset.  The receiver can also advance its current receive
   offset and notify the sender to advance its minimum retransmittable
   offset.

3.  New Frames

   This introduces new MIN_STREAM_DATA (Section 3.1) and
   EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA (Section 3.2) frames.

3.1.  MIN_STREAM_DATA Frame

   The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame (type=0x??) is used by a receiver to inform
   a sender of the maximum amount of data that can be sent on a stream
   (like MAX_STREAM_DATA frame) and to request an update to the minimum
   retransmittable offset (Section 2.4) and Exempt Stream Bytes value
   (Section 2.3) for this stream.

   The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame includes MAX_STREAM_DATA frame
   functionality solely for encoding efficiency, since any increase in
   the minimum offset of the stream is likey to come with a
   corresponding increase in stream flow control window.

   The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame includes Minimum Stream Offset and Exempt
   Stream Bytes fields in the same frame, since both affect connection
   flow control.  It would significantly complicate connection flow
   control accounting, if both fields were not updated at the same time.

   The frame is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Maximum Stream Data (i)                  ...

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields in the MIN_STREAM_DATA frame are as follows:

   Stream ID:  The stream ID of the stream that is affected encoded as a
      variable-length integer.

   Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the
      maximum amount of data that can be sent on the identified stream,
      in units of octets.

   Minimum Stream Offset:  A variable-length integer indicating the
      minimum offset of the stream data that the receiver is expecting
      to receive on the identified stream, in units of octets.

   Exempt Stream Bytes:  A variable-length integer indicating the amount
      of data on the identified stream exempt from connection flow
      control, in units of octets.

   The semantics of Maximum Stream Data field is identical to that of
   Maximum Stream Data field in MAX_STREAM_DATA frame.

   Since Stream 0 MUST be reliable, Stream ID MUST NOT be 0.

   Upon receipt of a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame, the sender advances the
   maximum amount of data that can be sent on the stream, the minimum
   retransmittable offset, and the Exempt Stream Bytes value to the
   corresponding values of Maximum Stream Data, Minimum Stream Offset,
   and Exempt Stream Bytes fields.

   If the minimum retransmittable offset becomes larger than the current
   send offset for a stream, the current send offset is advanced to the
   minimum retransmittable offset.

   The receiver MUST NOT reduce the maximum stream data value, minimum
   retransmittable offset, and Exempt Stream Bytes value for the stream,
   but loss and reordering can cause MIN_STREAM_DATA frames to be
   received out of order.  If Maximum Stream Data field does not advance

   the maximum amount of data that can be sent on the stream, or Minimum
   Stream Offset field does not advance the minimum retransmittable
   offset, or Exempt Stream Bytes field does not advance Exempt Stream
   Bytes value, the corresponding stream parameter is not updated.

   A MIN_STREAM_DATA referencing a closed or a "half-closed (local)"
   stream SHOULD be ignored.

   An endpoint that receives a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame for a receive-only
   stream MUST terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

   An endpoint that receives a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame for a send-only
   stream it has not opened MUST terminate the connection with error
   PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

   Note that an endpoint may legally receive a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame on
   a bidirectional stream it has not opened.

   An endpoint MUST terminate a connection with a MIN_STREAM_DATA_ERROR
   error, if one of the three fields is advancing its stream parameter,
   while another field is trying to retard its stream parameter.  An
   endpoint MUST terminate a connection with a MIN_STREAM_DATA_ERROR
   error, if Maximum Stream Data field is smaller than Minimum Stream
   Offset field or Minimum Stream Offset field is smaller than Exempt
   Stream Bytes field.

3.2.  EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA Frame

   The EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame (type=0x??) is used by a sender to
   inform a receiver of the minimum retransmittable offset (Section 2.4)
   for a stream.

   Sending EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame does not change the stream's
   current send offset.

   The frame is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                        Stream ID (i)                        ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                  Minimum Stream Offset (i)                  ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields in the EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame are as follows:

   Stream ID:  The stream ID of the stream that is affected encoded as a
      variable-length integer.

   Minimum Stream Offset:  A variable-length integer indicating the
      minimum offset of the stream data that will sent (or re-
      transmitted) on the identified stream, in units of octets.

   Since Stream 0 MUST be reliable, Stream ID MUST NOT be 0.

   Upon receipt of an EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame, the receiver advances
   the current receive offset for the stream to be Minimum Stream Offset
   value.

   The sender MUST NOT reduce the minimum retransmittable offset for a
   stream, but loss and reordering can cause EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frames
   to be received out of order.  EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frames that do not
   advance the current receive offset for the stream MUST be ignored.

   If the current receive offset becomes larger than the largest
   received offset for the stream, the receiver MUST advance the
   stream's Exempt Stream Bytes value by the difference between the
   current and the largest received offsets.  The largest received
   offset is then set to match the current receive offset, and the
   receiver SHOULD send a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame (Section 3.1).

   Note that receipt of an EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame may cause the
   current receive offset (and hence the largest received offset) to
   exceed a previously advertised maximum stream data value for the
   stream.

   An endpoint that receives an EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame for a send-
   only stream MUST terminate the connection with error
   PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

4.  Flow Control Update

   Flow control changes are designed to allow a sender that desires to
   expire a large number of bytes that have never been transmitted to do
   so efficiently and without closing down the connection flow control
   window (thereby blocking other streams).  That must be done in a way
   that does not open up the connection flow control window, allowing a
   different stream to use connection credits not designed for it.

4.1.  Connection Flow Control

   The connection flow control calculation is redefined to be the sum of
   the current stream offsets (current send offset for the sender and
   the largest received offset for the receiver) minus the sum of Exempt

   Stream Bytes values (Section 2.3) for all streams, including closed
   streams but excluding stream 0.

4.2.  Stream Final Offset

   If a STREAM-with-FIN or an RST_STREAM frame is received with the
   final stream offset smaller than largest received offset for a
   stream, it is only an error, if the final receive offset for the
   stream is smaller than largest offset learned from a STREAM or
   RST_STREAM frames.  If the final stream offset is smaller than the
   largest received offset, the final stream offset is advanced to be
   the largest received offset.

5.  QUIC Interface and Behavior

   QUIC library interface needs to expose additional APIs to allow
   applications to take advantage of partially reliable streams.

5.1.  Sender Interface and Behavior

   It is recommended that a QUIC library provides a way for a sender to
   update the minimum retransmittable offset (Section 2.4) for a stream.
   A typical sender would call this API function whenever data
   previously enqueued for transmission expires, per application
   semantics.  The sender would keep track of the message boundaries and
   request expiration of data on a message boundary.

   When an application instructs its QUIC transport to advance the
   minimum retransmittable offset for a stream, and there there is any
   unacknowledged data (including unsent data) at an offset smaller than
   the new minimum retransmittable offset, the sender SHOULD transmit a
   EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame (Section 3.2).

   An application may decide to conditionally expire messages based on
   the delivery status of prior messages.  For example, an application
   sending large messages may wish to ensure that its messages are
   delivered at least at a given minimum rate before expiring a
   partially-delivered message just because there is a newer message to
   deliver.  That is, if the rate of data the application wishes to
   write exceeds the network's throughput, the application may want to
   ensure that at least some messages are delivered in their entirety.
   To support this use case, it is recommended that a QUIC library API
   provides a way for the sender application to monitor the change in
   minimum retransmittable offset due to receipt of ACKs.

Internet-Draft                   quic-pr                        May 2018


5.2.  Receiver Interface and Behavior

   Upon receipt of an EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame (Section 3.2), the
   receiver SHOULD assume that none of the data before the new current
   receive offset (Section 2.4) will be retransmitted.  A receiver
   SHOULD discard any stream data received for an offset smaller than
   the new current receive offset.  Discarding such data ensures that
   when the application observes a gap in the data stream, what follows
   the gap is a beginning of a new message.

   It is recommended that a QUIC library API provides a way for a
   receiver application to obtain the length of a gap corresponding to
   the expired data in addition to data octets that follow the gap.

   It is recommended that a QUIC library API provide a way for a
   receiver application to skip data octets past the current point in
   the stream.  Such a request from the application should be treated by
   QUIC as a receipt of an EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame with the Minimum
   Stream Offset field set of the offset to which the application wished
   to skip.  If the current receive offset is advanced as a result of
   this application request, QUIC library SHOULD transmit a
   MIN_STREAM_DATA frame.

6.  Retransmission

   Both MIN_STREAM_DATA (Section 3.1) and EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA
   (Section 3.2) frames MUST be retransmitted if declared lost.

6.1.  Retransmission of MIN_STREAM_DATA

   The most recent MIN_STREAM_DATA frame MUST be retransmitted until the
   receiver is certain that the sender is not going to transmit any
   skipped data.  I.e. the frame MUST be retransmitted until the stream
   enters "half-closed (remote)" state, or all data between the largest
   Minimum Stream Offset field in an acknowledged MIN_STREAM_DATA or
   received EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frames and the current receive offset
   (Section 2.4) has been received.

6.2.  Retransmission of EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA

   The most recent EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame for a stream MUST be
   retransmitted until the sender is certain that the receiver is not
   expecting retransmission of any expired data.  I.e. the frame MUST be
   retransmitted until the stream enters "half-closed (local)" state, or
   all data between the largest Minimum Stream Offset field in an
   acknowledged EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA or received MIN_STREAM_DATA frames
   and the current minimum retransmittable offset (Section 2.4) has been
   acknowledged.
