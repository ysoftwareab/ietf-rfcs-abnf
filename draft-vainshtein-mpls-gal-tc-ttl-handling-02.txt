Handling the TC and TTL fields in a Label Stack Entry that Contains the
                    Generic Associated Channel Label
              draft-vainshtein-mpls-gal-tc-ttl-handling-02

Abstract

   This document clarifies handling of the Traffic Class (TC) and Time-
   to-Live (TTL) fields of a Label Stack Entry that contains the Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh) Label (GAL).  These clarifications are
   intended to aid interoperability of implementations.

   Original handling was defined in RFC 5586, and this document updates
   that RFC.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5586] introduced an alert mechanism for the Generic Associated
   Channel (G-ACh) that uses a Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL).
   In particular, [RFC5586] allocated one of the values from the special
   purpose label space to be the GAL, specified that the Label Stack
   Entry (LSE) containing GAL must be always at the bottom of the label
   stack in the case of MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs), and that G-ACh packets must not be forwarded based on
   the GAL.

   Per [RFC3032] each LSE contains, in addition to the label value and
   bottom-of-stack (BoS) flag, two additional fields:

   o  Traffic Class (TC) field - 3 bits (renamed from Experimental (EXP)
      field [RFC5462]).  [RFC5586] defined that the handling of this
      field in an LSE that contains the GAL is as specified and
      referenced in RFC 5462.

   o  Time-to-Live (TTL) field - 8 bits.  [RFC5586] defined that the
      handling of this field in an LSE that contains the GAL is in

      accordance with [RFC3443].  In addition, it defined (in
      Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC3443]) that:

      *  The TTL field of the GAL LSE MUST be set to at least 1.  The
         exact value of the TTL is application specific.

   The above-mentioned references to RFC 5462 and RFC 3443 are not very
   useful for the implementers because they do not define specific
   processing actions for these fields.  That is, even when they give
   guidance on how a sending implementation should set a field, they
   don't explain how a receiving implementation should be "liberal in
   what it accepts".  For example, [RFC5462] says only that the use of
   TC field for Quality of Service (QoS) and Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) "is intended to be flexible".  On the other hand,
   while [RFC3443] is very detailed with regard to processing of the TTL
   field, it mainly deals with issues that are irrelevant for an LSE
   that contains the GAL because RFC 5586 explicitly prohibits
   forwarding labeled packets based on the GAL.

   Implementations of [RFC5586] have encountered interoperability
   problems in their interpretation of these two fields when present in
   an LSE that contains the GAL.

   When this LSE becomes the top entry in the label stack (because the
   previous label has been popped) some receiving implementations have
   attempted to interpret the TC and TTL fields.  In particular, packets
   with an LSE that contains the GAL with TTL set to one can be trapped
   to the generic (slow) MPLS exception handler with appropriate rate
   limiting before the GAL is noticed (which would otherwise result in
   trapping the packet to a fast OAM handler).  The resultant poor
   performance in handling TTL of one could be seen as a poor
   implementation choice, but it does not violate RFC 5586.

   Similarly, the setting of the TC field in the top LSE impacts how a
   packet is forwarded.  When the top LSE contains the GAL, the packet
   will not be forwarded, so the value of the TC field should not be
   relevant (or, at most, should impact only on internal prioritization
   such as within a software implementation).  However, some
   implementations might action the TC field before determining that the
   GAL is present and so might be subject to poor or unexpected behavior
   dependent on the setting of the field.

   This document clarifies the rules for setting and processing the TC
   and TTL fields in the LSE that contains the GAL in an unambiguous way
   without referring to any other documents.  This will improve
   interoperability with implementations that are potentially flawed in
   their handling of these fields.  It updates [RFC5586] in that regard.

   In summary, the objctive of this document is not to change the
   conformance requirements of existing implementations, but to enhance
   the likelihood of new implementations interoperating with each other
   and with implementations already in the field.  In particular, to
   improve the interoperability results where a new implemntation
   interacts with a legacy implementation that may be sender or receiver
   of an LSE that contains the GAL and that may be any of:

   o  built with poor design considerations

   o  implemented with a misunderstanding of RFC 5586

   o  over-zealous in its policing of RFC 5586 behavior

3.  New Procedures

3.1.  New Procedures for Handling the TC Field in an LSE That Contains
      the GAL

   Setting the value of the TC field in an LSE that contains the GAL is
   done by the LER that originates the G-ACh packet and is a matter of
   local policy for that LER.  It is RECOMMENDED that implementations
   set the TC field of an LSE that contains the GAL to all zero (0b000),
   but they MAY vary this according to local policy.

   The LER that inspects an LSE that contains the GAL MUST ignore the
   value of the TC field.

3.2.  New Procedures for Handling the TTL Field in an LSE Containing GAL

   Setting the value of the TTL in an LSE that contains the GAL is done
   by the LER that originates the G-ACh packet and is a matter of local
   policy for that LER.  The LER that originates the G-ACh packet MUST
   NOT set this value to 0 and SHOULD NOT set this value to 1: this will
   avoid possible misinterpretation by the LER that inspects an LSE that
   contains the GAL if that LER does not comply with this document.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that implementations set the TTL of an LSE that
   contains the GAL to 255, but they MAY vary this according to local
   policy.

   An LER that examines an LSE that contains the GAL MUST ignore the
   value of the TTL field.

3.3.  Scope of the new Procedures

   [RFC5586] disallowed the use of the GAL in PWs, but that limitation
   was relaxed in [RFC6423].

   The new procedures defined in this document for handling the TC field
   and the TTL field in an LSE that contains the GAL apply equally to
   all possible uses of the GAL including the so-called "Section G-ACh"
   where the GAL is the only label in the label stack, and the use of
   the GAL in LSPs and PWs.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA action.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document makes a minor update to the processing for MPLS packets
   containing the GAL and does not change any of the security
   fundamentals of MPLS.  For a discussion of security considerations
   relating to MPLS, please refer to [RFC5920].

   Note that the rules set out in this document specify that a receiver
   must ignore the values in the two MPLS LSE fields that are discussed.
   As such, this clarification removes a potential (and minor) attack
   vector where those fields could be malignly set and might cause
   incorrect action by the receiver.
