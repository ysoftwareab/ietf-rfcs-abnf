Abstract

   This memo specifies Traffic Engineering extensions for OSPF version 2
   for dealing with multi-access networks.  In particular, the bandwidth
   attributes in the original OSPFv2 TE specification do not accurately
   model the available bandwidth across a multi-access network; this
   memo rectifies this shortcoming.

1. Introduction

   RFC 3630 [2] specifies how Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of
   links can be carried in OSPF v2 Opaque Link State Advertisements
   (LSAs) [3], but explicits states (in section 1.2) that "The
   reservation state of multi-access links may not be accurately
   reflected".  This is the case for at least two reasons:

      (a) the Designated Router (DR) doesn't generate an Opaque LSA to
          define the reservation state of links _towards_ routers in a
          multi-access network;
      (b) even if it did, it would be hard for the DR to keep track of
          this reservation state.

   Consider the following multi-access network N:

                A           B           C           D

                |           |           |           |
                |           |           |           |
        N   ---------------------------------------------
                      |           |           |
                      |           |           |

                      E           F           G

   This is modelled in OSPF (and OSPF-TE) as:

                            B           C

                             \         /
                              \       /
                               \     /

                       A  -----   X  -----  D

                               /  |  \
                              /   |   \
                             /    |    \

   where one of the routers A-G is elected the DR, here called X.

   In OSPF-TE, each of the routers A through G advertises its available
   (unreserved) bandwidth towards X by means of a TE LSA.  X, on the
   other hand, does not advertise a TE LSA, instead advertising a
   regular network LSA per the OSPF v2 protocol [4], section 7.3.
   Routers computing paths across network N simply assume that there is
   always sufficient bandwidth from X to each of the routers A through
   G.

   Consider the case where N is implemented by a switch such that each
   router has a full-duplex 100Mbps connection to the switch, and
   advertises 100Mbps in its TE LSAs.  A remote router R computing a
   100Mbps path would see that 100Mbps is available from A to X, and
   ignoring the X->D link, could set up a path via A and D.
   Subsequently, another remote router Q looking at the B->X->D links
   would conclude that there was sufficient bandwidth for a 100Mbps path
   via B->D.  However, this would put 200Mbps of traffic on the 100Mbps
   link from the switch to D.

   This memo attempts to rectify this shortcoming of [2].


2. Approach

   A simple approach would be for the DR to advertise TE LSAs for links
   from itself to other routers.  This is undesirable for at least three
   reasons:

      (a) This change is not backward compatible with [2].
      (b) The only relevant TE information on the links advertised from
          the DR to other routers is the available bandwidth.
          Advertising a metric or administrative groups from X to A, for
          example, would change the topology of the overall network.
      (c) It is non-trivial for the DR to track the available bandwidth
          on other routers' links.  In the above example, how would the
          DR know how much traffic has been reserved on the link from N
          to D?

   The approach taken here is for each router (say A) to advertise in
   its TE LSA for its link to the DR (i.e., A->X) the available "reverse
   bandwidth" (i.e., X to A).

   Going back to the example above, each router A-G would advertise its
   available forward bandwidth (100Mbps), as well as its available
   reverse bandwidth (100Mbps).  When router R set up the path via
   A->X->D, D would advertise that its available reverse bandwith (D<-X)
   was now zero.  Hence router Q would not attempt to use the X->D link.

3. Encoding in OSPF v2 TE LSAs

   The Reverse Bandwidth sub-TLV of the TE Link TLV is encoded in OSPF
   v2 as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       Type (TBD by IANA)      |             Length            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Media Type   |                 Reserved (sbz)                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Reverse Available Bandwidth at Index 0             |
      .                                                               .
      .                                                               .
      .                                                               .
      |            Reverse Available Bandwidth at Index k             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   "sbz" means SHOULD be zero when sending, SHOULD be ignored on
   receipt.

   The Type is [TBD].  The Length is equal to 4 + 4*(k+1) octets.

3.1. Types of Multiaccess Media

   Media Type values are given in the following table:

        Value    Media Type
        -----    ----------
            0    Unknown
            1    Shared
            2    Switched Half Duplex
            3    Switched Full Duplex
        4-255    Reserved

   An example of a "Shared" link is a CSMA/CD Ethernet connection ([5]).
   An example of a "Switched Half Duplex" link is a half duplex port on
   a switched Ethernet ([6]).  An example of a "Switched Full Duplex"
   link is a full duplex port on a switched Ethernet.

3.2. Reverse Available Bandwidth

   The semantics of the "Reverse Available Bandwidth at Index i"
   parallels exactly the available bandwidth at index i as advertised in
   the "Unreserved Bandwidth" field, except that it is in the reverse
   direction (DR to router, rather than router to DR).  The format and
   units are identical to that of the "Unreserved Bandwidth" field.

Internet Draft      OSPF TE for Multi-access Networks       October 2003


3.3. Consistency Checks

   A Reverse Bandwidth sub-TLV within a TE Link TLV is ignored in its
   entirety if the link's Link Type is not 'Multiaccess' (value 2).

   Consider the set of links belonging to a given multi-access network.
   Not all the corresponding TE Link TLVs need have a Reverse Bandwidth
   sub-TLV.  However those that do MUST have compatible Media Types,
   i.e., they MUST all be "Shared"; or they MUST all be either "Switched
   Half Duplex" or "Switched Full Duplex".  If this test fails, all
   Reverse Bandwidth sub-TLVs for the set of links connected to this DR
   SHOULD be ignored.

   If a new Media Type is defined, so must corresponding consistency
   checks for the new type.

   For multi-access links with Media Type "Shared" or "Switched Half
   Duplex", the Reverse Available Bandwidths SHOULD NOT be advertised,
   and SHOULD be ignored on receipt (i.e., k = -1, and the Reverse
   Bandwidth TLV Length SHOULD be 4).

   For multi-access links with Media Type "Switched Full Duplex", if the
   Unreserved Bandwidth sub-TLV (type 8) of the Link TLV contains
   priority levels 0 through n, then k SHOULD be equal to n.  Values of
   Reverse Available Bandwidth at index i > n (if any) SHOULD be
   ignored.  If k < n, then computation of available bandwidth for index
   i, k < i < n, will perforce be inaccurate.


4. Computing Available Bandwidth

   This section illustrates how the information in the Reverse Bandwidth
   TLV can be used to compute the available bandwidth in the direction
   DR->router.  It is however not meant as a primer on Constraint-based
   Routing.

4.1. Shared Media

   For each link l in multi-access network N of type Shared, let Ml be
   the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (sub-TLV 7 of the Link TLV) for l,
   and let Ul be the Unreserved Bandwidth at index i for l.

   Let M be min (Ml) over all links l in N.  The available bandwidth at
   index i Ai across N (independent of which pair of routers in N) is
   given by

         Ai = M - sum (Ml - Ul)      (sum taken over all links l in N)

Internet Draft      OSPF TE for Multi-access Networks       October 2003


4.2. Switched Media

   Consider two routers A and B and a designated router X in a multi-
   access network N.  Call the link from A to X 'a' and the link from B
   to X 'b'.  The available bandwidth at index i from A to B when the
   Media Type of b is "Switched Half Duplex" is given by;
         min (Ua, Ub)
   where Ua is the Unreserved Bandwidth at index i for link a, and Ub is
   the Unreserved Bandwidth at index i for link b.

   If link b is of Media Type "Switched Full Duplex", the available
   bandwidth at index i from A to B is given by:
         min (Ua, Rb)
   where Ua is the Unreserved Bandwidth at index i for link a, and Rb is
   the Reverse Available Bandwidth at index i for link b.

   If link b doesn't have a Reverse Bandwidth sub-TLV, it is treated as
   a link of type "Switched Half Duplex".

   Note 1: if a flow of bandwidth B at index i in any direction is
   successfully admitted on a link of Media Type "Switched Half Duplex",
   then the Unreserved Bandwidth at index i on that link is decremented
   by B.

   Note 2: if a flow of bandwidth B at index i in the direction towards
   the DR is successfully admitted on a link of Media Type "Switched
   Full Duplex", then the Unreserved Bandwidth at index i on that link
   is decremented by B.  If the flow is away from the DR, the Reverse
   Available Bandwidth at index i on that link is decremented by B.
