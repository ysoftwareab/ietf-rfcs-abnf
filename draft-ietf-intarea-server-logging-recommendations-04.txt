Internet-Draft       Internet facing server logging           April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The global IPv4 address free pool at IANA was exhausted in February
   2011.  Service providers will now have a hard time finding enough
   IPv4 global addresses to sustain product and subscriber growth.  Due
   to the huge global existing infrastructure, both hardware and
   software, vendors and service providers must continue to support IPv4
   technologies for the foreseeable future.  As legacy applications and
   hardware are retired the reliance on IPv4 will diminish but this is a
   years long perhaps decades long process.

   To maintain legacy IPv4 address support, service providers will have
   little choice but to share IPv4 global addresses among multiple
   customers.  Techniques to do so are outside of the scope of this
   document.  All include some form of address translation/address
   sharing, being NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] or DS-Lite
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   The effects on the Internet of the introduction of those address
   sharing techniques have been documented in
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues].

   Address sharing techniques come with their own logging infrastructure
   to track the relation between which original IP address and source
   port(s) were associated with which user and external IPv4 address at
   any given point in time.  In the past to support abuse mitigation or
   public safety requests, the knowledge of the external global IP
   address was enough to identify a subscriber of interest.  With
   address sharing technologies, only providing information about the
   external public address associated with a session to a service
   provider is no longer sufficient information to unambiguously
   identify customers.

   Note: this document provides recommendations for Internet facing
   servers logging incoming connections.  It does not provide any
   recommendations about logging on carrier-grade NAT or other address
   sharing tools.


2.  Recommendations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   It is RECOMMENDED as best current practice that Internet facing
   servers logging incoming IP addresses from inbound IP traffic also

   log:

   o  The source port number.

   o  A timestamp, RECOMMENDED in UTC, accurate to the second, from a
      traceable time source (e.g., NTP [RFC5905]).

   o  The transport protocol (usually TCP or UDP) and destination port
      number, when the server application is defined to use multiple
      transports or multiple ports.

   Discussion: Carrier-grade NATs may have different policies to recycle
   ports, some implementations may decide to reuse ports almost
   immediately, some may wait several minutes before marking the port
   ready for reuse.  As a result, servers have no idea how fast the
   ports will be reused and, thus, should log timestamps using a
   reasonably accurate clock.  At this point the RECOMMENDED accuracy
   for timestamps is to the second or better.  Representation of
   timestamps in UTC is prefered to localtime with UTC-offset or time
   zone as this extra information can be lost in the reporting chain.

   Examples of Internet facing servers include, but are not limited to,
   web servers and email servers.

   Although the deployment of address sharing techniques is not foreseen
   in IPv6, the above recommendations apply to both IPv4 and IPv6, if
   only for consistency and code simplification reasons.

   Discussions about data retention policies are out of scope for this
   document.  Server security and transport security is important for
   the protection of logs for Internet facing systems.  The operator of
   the Internet facing server must consider the risks, including the
   data and services on the server to determine the appropriate
   measures.  The protection of logs is critical in incident
   investigations.  If logs are tampered with, evidence could be
   destroyed.

   The above recommendations also apply to devices such as load-
   balancers logging incoming connections on behalf of actual servers.

   The above recommendations apply to current logging practices.  They
   do not require any changes in the way logging is performed; e.g.,
   which packets are examined and logged.


3.  ISP Considerations

   ISP deploying IP address sharing techniques should also deploy a

   corresponding logging architecture to maintain records of the
   relation between a customer's identity and IP/port resources
   utilized.  However, recommendations on this topic are out of scope
   for this document.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.


5.  Security Considerations

   In the absence of source port number and accurate timestamp,
   operators deploying any address sharing techniques will not be able
   to identify unambiguously customers when dealing with abuse or public
   safety queries.
