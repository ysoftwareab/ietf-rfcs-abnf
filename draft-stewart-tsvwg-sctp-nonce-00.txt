Internet-Draft             ECN-nonce for SCTP              February 2009


Abstract

   This document describes the addition of the ECN-nonce RFC 3540
   [RFC3540] to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC 2960
   [RFC2960].  The ECN-nonce reduces the vulnerability of ECN senders to
   misbehaving receivers that conceal congestion signals like ECN marks
   and packet losses.  The ECN-nonce approach is different in SCTP
   because SCTP uses chunks for extensible protocol features and is
   selective acknowlegement (SACK)-based; this document describes those
   differences.  In particular this document describes (1) protocol
   extensions in the form of a single new parameter for the INIT/
   INIT-ACK chunks, and a single bit flag in the SACK chunk, and (2)
   rules governing the sender and receiver side implementation.

   This document outlines a minimum response that an SCTP sender should
   apply after detecting a misbehaving receiver.

Internet-Draft             ECN-nonce for SCTP              February 2009


1.  Introduction

   Like TCP, SCTP RFC 2960 [RFC2960] supports Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) RFC 3168 [RFC3168], and therefore is exposed to
   misbehaving receivers that conceal congestion signals.  The
   misbehavior includes the concealment of ECN Echo (ECNE) signals which
   may cause an SCTP sender to be agressive and unfair to compliant
   flows.  The ECN-nonce RFC 3540 [RFC3540] adds robustness to ECN
   signaling for TCP.  This document analogously applies the ECN-nonce
   to SCTP.  The ECN-nonce can be used to protect against other
   misbehaviors as well, such as optimistic acknowledgements
   [paper.savage99], and false Duplicate TSN notifications for more
   information discussions in RFC 3708 [RFC3708] may be helpful.

   The reader should be familiar with the ECN-Nonce as described in RFC
   3540 [RFC3540].  This document describes only the SCTP-specific
   aspects of the ECN-nonce.

1.1.  Overview of Protocol Extensions

   This document specifies the following:

   1.  A single new Nonce-Supported parameter in the INIT/INIT-ACK
   chunks exchanged during the association establishment to indicate to
   the peer whether ECN-nonce is supported.

   2.  A single bit flag in the SACK chunk called the Nonce Sum (NS),
   and the rules governing the sending, calculating and checking of the
   nonce sum.

   The ECN-nonce does not change the existing ECN protocol.  The ECN-
   nonce uses two bits of the IP header called the ECN Capable Transport
   (ECT) bits.  The sender randomly generates a single bit nonce and
   encodes it in the ECT codepoints, ECT(0) or ECT(1).  To indicate
   congestion in the network, routers may overwrite the ECT codepoints
   with a Congestion Experienced (CE) marking.  The nonce sum is a
   cumulative one bit addition of the nonces received so far.  The
   receiver calculates the nonce sum and returns it in the NS flag of
   the SACK chunk.  The sender verifies the value of the NS flag in the
   SACK chunk.  Since all the nonces are needed to calculate the correct
   nonce sum, an incorrect nonce sum implies that one or more nonces are
   missing at the receiver.  If an incorrect nonce sum is received by
   the sender without ECNE signals, the sender can infer that the
   receiver is misbehaving and concealing congestion notifications.

   It is beyond the scope of this document to specify a sender's
   complete response after detecting a misbehaving receiver.  However
   this document outlines the minimum response that a sender SHOULD

   apply to a receiver's misbehavior.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Extension to SCTP

3.1.  Nonce-Supported Parameter Definition

   Endpoints supporting ECN-nonce SHOULD use the following OPTIONAL
   parameter to indicate that the ECN-nonce extension is supported.

   Chunk Flags:

   Reserved: 7 bits

   Set to 0 on transmit and ignored on receipt.

   NS: 1 bit

   The Nonce Sum (NS) flag is set by the sender of the SACK chunk with
   the apropriate calculated value (1 bit cumulative nonce sum).  If
   either peer does not support the ECN-nonce, then the NS flag is
   always set to 0.


4.  Nonce-Supported Parameter Negotiation

   An SCTP endpoint supporting the ECN-nonce SHOULD include the Nonce-
   Supported Parameter in the INIT chunk when initializing the

Internet-Draft             ECN-nonce for SCTP              February 2009


   association to indicate this to the peer.

   When a receiver supports the ECN-nonce and detects a Nonce-Supported
   parameter in the INIT chunk, the receiver SHOULD respond with a
   Nonce-supported parameter in the INIT-ACK chunk.

   When an SCTP endpoint that supports the ECN-nonce receives an INIT
   chunk without the Nonce-Supported parameter, that SCTP endpoint:

   o  MAY include the Nonce-Supported parameter in the INIT-ACK chunk.
   o  SHOULD NOT set the NS flag in the SACK chunk during the lifetime
      of the association.

   An SCTP endpoint that supports the ECN-nonce SHOULD disable ECN
   (i.e., stop setting the ECT codepoints for the association) if its
   peer does not support the ECN-nonce.  An SCTP endpoint that does not
   support the ECN-nonce may be denied preferential treatment or
   otherwise penalized by a peer that supports the ECN-nonce based on
   that peer's policy.


5.  ECN-nonce Operation

   The following sub-sections describe in detail the ECN-nonce
   operation.  This operation includes (i) the local SCTP state to be
   maintained at each endpoint, (ii) the sender procedures for
   transmitting nonces and checking of the nonce sum, (iii) intermediate
   router(s) behavior, and (iv) the receiver procedures for calculating
   the nonce sum from the received nonces, and returning the nonce sum
   to the sender.

5.1.  State Information

   SCTP endpoints should maintain a single bit local state called
   "current nonce sum".  The current nonce sum is a one bit cumulative
   addition of the nonces.  In the beginning of a new SCTP association
   the current nonce sum SHOULD be initialised to one.

   SCTP senders should store a mapping from Transmission Sequence
   Numbers (TSNs) to nonce values associated with packets.

   The following sections describe in detail how these values are
   maintained and updated.

5.2.  Sender Behavior (Transmit)

   The sender's transmit behavior follows Section 3 of RFC 3540
   [RFC3540] with the following changes to nonce handling.



Stewart, et al.          Expires August 20, 2009                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             ECN-nonce for SCTP              February 2009


   The one-bit nonce is placed or encoded only for SCTP packets which
   carry one or more "new" DATA chunks.  Only SCTP packets containing
   one or more "new" DATA chunks can be marked as ECN-capable (with
   either ECT(0) or ECT(1) codepoints set), so only these packets can
   use the one-bit nonce.  This is because control chunks are not
   subject to congestion control, and thus a router's ECN-marking of
   control chunks would not illicit a congestion response.

   The sender maintains a mapping of the TSNs of transmitted DATA chunks
   with the nonce values placed in the respective packets.  When
   multiple DATA chunks are bundled in the same packet, only one of the
   TSNs transmitted in that packet is mapped to the nonce placed in the
   packet.  All other TSNs transmitted in the same packet are mapped to
   a nonce value of zero.

   (Implementation Note: An implementation may maintain the mapping of
   only the single TSN sent in each packet with the corresponding nonce.
   Said implementation will assume that all TSNs lying between two
   consecutive TSNs in the data structure are mapped to a nonce value of
   zero.)

5.3.  Router Behavior

   For the ECN-nonce to function correctly, routers should behave as
   specified in RFC 3168 [RFC3168].

5.4.  Receiver Behavior (Receive and Transmit)

   The receiver updates the value of its current nonce sum on receiving
   a packet carrying one or more new DATA chunks.  Recall that the nonce
   sum is the cumulative one bit addition of the nonces received so far.
   Thus on receipt of a packet with one or more new DATA chunks a single
   bit addition of the current nonce sum and the received nonce is
   performed.  The result is the new value of current nonce sum.

   In contrast to RFC 3540 [RFC3540], the current nonce sum is also
   updated immediately when receiving out of order packets.  SCTP is
   inherently a SACK based protocol, hence an SCTP sender can know
   exactly which packets had reached the receiver out of order.

   When a packet is marked with a Congestion Experienced (CE) signal,
   the original nonce is unknown to the receiver.  The missing nonce
   value is ignored (or equivalently a value of zero is assumed) when
   calculating the current nonce sum.

   When the receiver sends a SACK chunk, the current nonce sum (the
   updated value as described above) is placed in the NS flag (defined
   in Section 3.2) of the SACK chunk.

Internet-Draft             ECN-nonce for SCTP              February 2009


   (Implementation Note: When sending an ECNE chunk and a SACK chunk in
   response to a CE marked packet that contained one or more DATA
   chunks, an SCTP endpoint should try to bundle the ECNE chunk and the
   SACK chunk in the same packet.)

5.5.  Sender Side (Receive)

   This section describes the sender's procedure for verifying the nonce
   sum returned by the receiver.

   The nonce sum is verified on the receipt of a SACK chunk which
   acknowledges new data, either via an advanced Cumulative TSN Ack
   field or by new Gap Ack Blocks.  To verify the nonce sum, the sender
   SHOULD:

   o  Calculate the expected nonce sum.  This calculation is a single
      bit addition of the current nonce sum plus all the nonce values
      corresponding to the new data acknowledged.  The nonce values are
      looked up from the local mapping of TSNs and nonce values
      maintained at the sender.
   o  Set the current nonce sum to the value of expected nonce sum.
   o  Compare the current nonce sum with the NS flag returned in the
      SACK chunk.

   The sender SHOULD disable checking of the nonce sum in the following
   three scenarios (checking of the nonce sum SHOULD be enabled after
   re-synchronization as described in Section 5.6) :

   o  On detecting that a packet has been lost (i.e., after receiving
      four missing reports or after the expiration of the retransmission
      timer).  Nonce checking is suspended because the receiver has
      admitted to missing packets and an ordinary congestion response is
      in effect.
   o  On receiving an ECNE chunk from the receiver.  Nonce checking is
      suspended because the receiver has admitted to a congestion
      experienced mark and an ordinary congestion response is in effect.
   o  After sending a FORWARD TSN chunk defined in RFC 3758[RFC3758].
      The FORWARD TSN chunk is used by SCTP senders that support the
      partially reliable extension to move the receiver's cumulative ack
      point forward.

   If nonce sum checking is enabled, and a SACK chunk is received with
   an incorrect nonce sum, then several scenarios are possible: (i) the
   ECNE and SACK chunks were sent in separate packets and the ECNE chunk
   was dropped by the network, (ii) the ECNE chunk was sent in a
   separate packet after the SACK chunk (i.e., the ECNE chunk is
   currently in the network), or (iii) the receiver is misbehaving and
   concealing Congestion Experienced (CE) signals.

Internet-Draft             ECN-nonce for SCTP              February 2009


   To detect unambiguously that a receiver is misbehaving, the sender
   waits until new data, sent after having received the incorrect nonce
   sum, is acknowledged.  The sender also suspends checking of the nonce
   sum during this period.  If no ECNE chunk is received till the
   acknowledgement for the new data arrives, the sender can be certain
   that the receiver is concealing CE signals and thus misbehaving.

5.6.  Re-synchronization of the Nonce Sum

   To enable proper checking of the nonce sums, re-synchronization of
   the sender and receiver current nonce sums is required in three
   situations.

   o  Loss of one or more packets in a window of data: Re-
      synchronization of the sender and receiver current nonce sum
      occurs when new data sent after the congestion window was reduced
      is acknowledged via the Cumulative TSN Ack field.
   o  After having received an ECNE chunk: Re-synchronization of the
      sender and receiver current nonce sum occurs when new data sent
      after the Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) chunk is acknowldeged
      via the Cumulative TSN Ack field.
   o  After sending a FORWARD TSN chunk: Re-synchronization of the
      sender and receiver current nonce sum occurs when new data sent
      after the FORWARD TSN chunk is acknowledged via the Cumulative TSN
      Ack field.

   To re-synchronize, the sender simply sets its current nonce sum to
   the value of NS flag received in the SACK chunk.


6.  Sender's Response

   The following discussion describes the response that SHOULD be
   applied (i) to a peer that does not support the ECN-nonce, or (ii)
   after having detected a misbehaving receiver.

6.1.  Response to a peer that does not support the ECN-nonce

   o  An SCTP endpoint that supports the ECN-nonce SHOULD disable ECN
      (i.e., stop setting the ECT codepoints for the association) if its
      peer does not support the ECN-nonce.
   o  Optionally, an SCTP sender can further respond by rate limiting
      the association.  Several such responses are possible; this
      document leaves them as a matter of policy that can be exercised
      by an endpoint.

   o  After having detected a misbehaving receiver, the SCTP sender
      SHOULD disable ECN for the rest of the association.
   o  The minimum penalty to a receiver's misbehavior SHOULD be the
      equivalent of the response to an ECNE chunk.
   o  Optionally, an SCTP sender can further respond to a misbehaving
      receiver by setting the congestion window (cwnd) to one, thus re-
      probing the available bandwidth.  This conservative action
      eliminates the incentive for a receiver to misbehave.  Several
      such responses are possible; this document leaves them as a matter
      of policy that can be exercised by an endpoint.


7.  Summary

   This document applies the ECN-nonce proposal RFC 3540 [RFC3540] to
   SCTP.

   A single new parameter called the Nonce-Supported parameter and a
   single bit flag in the SACK chunk called the Nonce Sum (NS) have been
   described along with rules governing the sender and receiver side
   implementation.  This document outlines the minimum response that a
   sender should apply to a receiver's misbehavior.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document shares the same security concerns as RFC 3540
   [RFC3540].


9.  IANA Considerations

   A single bit flag in the SACK chunk called the Nonce Sum (NS) is used
   by this proposal, and must be allocated.

   One new parameter type code is defined by this document to be added
   to SCTP RFC 2960 ('0x8001').
