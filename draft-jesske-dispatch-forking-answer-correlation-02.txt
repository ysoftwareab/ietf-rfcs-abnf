1.  Problem Statement

   The world of SIP networks is steadily growing.  SIP networks based on
   IETF RFC 3261 also networks of operators based on 3GPP IMS or ETSI
   TISPAN NGN and many others are existing.  Now connecting these
   networks may result in problems of interoperability.  One main

   problem is the SIP basic feature forking which allows to spread the
   INVITE request towards multiples registered UA's for one identity.
   Nevertheless the forking feature described in RFC3261 [RFC3261] which
   allows to reach more than one target and which is registered under
   the same identity but at different locations is not really supported
   by all UAC in that way that a connection between UAC and one of the
   UAS will succeed in a successful communication even one of the UAS
   sends a 200 OK for the INVITE.  This apply also to networks having
   B2BUA's (e.g.  PSTN interwoking Gateways or Session Border
   Controller) in the path which should understand multiples responses
   and handle it correctly.

   This could result in many SIP early Dialogs that will never
   established due to the applicability of the UAC to receive multiples
   early dialogs.

   RFC3261 [RFC3261] indicates how the UAC must/should/may behave (some
   aspects updated by RFC6026 [RFC6026] and RFC6141 [RFC6141]); this
   includes the impacts of receiving INVITE's 18x or 2xx on a known or
   unknown dialog.  However, it frequently defers the human interaction
   decisions to the implementor.

   Similarly, a device can be fully compliant with RFC3261 [RFC3261] but
   decide to have a service to terminate call after or before answer (or
   individual early dialogs before answer) if more than 1 dialog was
   observed during call setup.  Such a "service" likely indicates that
   the device doesn't really support forking proxies (or maybe doesn't
   trust forking interactions).

   One use case is when the UAC will alway ever apply to the first
   received provisional response and wait for a final response for the
   certain provisional response.

   Forking itself apply when Bob is registering his home phone and his
   SIP client on his notebook with the same identity.  This INVITE will
   now be sent to both end devices.  And each end device will answer
   with a provisional response (e.G. 180 ringing) or a final response.

   Now the originating SIP device has to understand that two devices are
   ringing and one will answer the call.  No Problem since RFC3261
   [RFC3261] allows this and allows also the originating device to
   handle multiples responses.  But this is not mandated by RFC3261
   [RFC3261] and led to implementers choice.  There will the first
   problem apply that only one of the Responses will be taken into
   consideration for creating a dialog.

   Please Note that RFC3261 [RFC3261] doesn't do require how the
   responses from multiple forks are to be handled and the basic

   transaction and dialog semantics must be followed.  But looking into
   reality there are many broken clients and entities out in the world
   and service provides doing forking for their customers may disappoint
   them because it will not work proper and no connectivity will be
   reached.

   With further features like Preconditions and reliability of
   provisional responses the UAC has to reserve resources for one or
   both of the responses and opens a early dialog.  And has to choose
   which of the dialogs should be reserved when not supporting multiples
   early dialogs.  Thus a spread of problems arise with such behavior.

   This document describes how a correlation for multiples early dialogs
   and other received Responses can done within a B2BUA.  The possible
   roles of a B2BUA is described in the taxonomy document RFC7029
   [RFC7029] The role of the B2BUA is a Signaling/Media Plane B2BUA
   Role.  Thus many possible use cases which will be possible looking on
   the used features are considered in this document

2.  Consideration of RFC's on SIP signalling procedures under
    consideration for forking use cases

2.1.  RFC3261 Session Initiation Protocol

   SIP defined in RFC3261 [RFC3261]describes how forking should apply.
   Also rules for UA for responses in general and merged requests are
   defined.  But it is not stated how a forking correlation should apply
   and what is needed.

   A couple of rules with regard to non 2xx final responses apply to the
   forking proxy with regard to forwarding it to the UAC.  The Response-
   Context defined in RFC3261 [RFC3261] will hold the received non 2xx
   final responses until for all INVITE transactions a final response is
   received. 1xx and 2xx response will be forwarded immediately.  And
   for 6xx Responses the proxy SHOULD cancel all client pending
   transactions.

   So with regard to non 2xx and 1xx final responses the forking proxy
   has to aggregate and act as central element

2.2.  RFC3262 Reliability of provisional responses

   The RFC describing the reliability of provisional Responses RFC3262
   [RFC3262] does not describes interactions with forking.  Thus a PRACK
   for provisional Response is seen as a single transaction and makes
   the SDD reliable for the specific dialog.  This is a end to end
   behavior between the UAS and the related UAC.

Internet-Draft     forking answer correlation in B2BUA      October 2014


2.3.  RFC3312 Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP)

   Also in RFC3313 [RFC3312] describing the precondition mechanism is
   not mentioning any interactions with forking relevant issues.

2.4.  RFC3841 Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP)

   RFC3841 [RFC3841] describes extensions to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) which allow a caller (UAC) to express preferences
   about request handling in servers.

   One of the caller preferences defined in RFC3841 [RFC3841]. is a
   method to signal the "fork-directive" to indicate if the SIP proxy is
   allowed to fork or not fork the request in the forwarding path.  This
   directive is a optional SIP feature which is not implemented in each
   SIP network.  The Request Disposition header contains the regarding
   directive which is requested by the User Agent.

   The parallel-directive does indicate how a SIP proxy should fork the
   request.  Either "parallel" or "sequential"

2.5.  RFC5393 Addressing an Amplification Vulnerability in Session
      Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forking Proxies

   To avoid too many forkings (possible early Dialogs) RFC5393 [RFC5393]
   defines the Max-Breadth header to avoid to many forked Requests.  But
   there is no effect on correlating the responses.  This helps to
   reduce a cascading of multiples forkings in the forward path.  The
   number in the header gives the maximum branches (parallel possible
   early dialogs) of a forked request.  Exceeding the maximum will
   result in error responses 440

2.6.  RFC6228 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Response Code for
      Indication of Terminated Dialog

   RFC6228 [RFC6228]defines a new response code to close early dialogs
   proper.  In case where a forking proxy realizes that a 200 OK has
   been processed the proxy can sent 199 responses to the other open
   dialogs.  This helps in case of correlation when early dialogs has
   been sent till the end user.

   In consideration with the rules defined in RFC3261 for forking proxy
   a received non 2xx final to an initial dialog initiation request that
   it recognizes as terminating one or more early dialogs associated
   with the request.  The forking proxy generates normally (e.g. non

Internet-Draft     forking answer correlation in B2BUA      October 2014


   100rel, no final response sent) 199 response upstream for each of the
   terminated early dialogs.

2.7.  RFC3326 The Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP)

   RFC3326 [RFC3326] defines the Reason header and describes one use
   because in case the INVITE is forked and results in a rejection, the
   error response may never be forwarded to the client unless all the
   other branches also reject the request.  This problem is known as the
   "Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem", or HERFP.  It is
   foreseen that a solution to this problem may involve encapsulating
   the final error response in a provisional response.  The Reason
   header field is a candidate to be used for such encapsulation.  In
   this case the forking proxy will release the dialogs.

2.8.  Conclusions

   All above mentioned RFCs and procedures describes a piece of the
   whole picture how forking apply and what procedures are useabel for
   such cases.  It is also fact that UA's and B2BUA's (e.g.  PSTN GW)
   are existing that will not support multiples early dialogs.  Also the
   support of caller preferences is not secured or implemented by UAC
   and also SIP forking proxies.  Service providers will provide forking
   independent what the source will support or not.  Thus the only
   solution seen is to describe procedures which apply in B2BUA to
   support an correlation of multiples early dialogs and other received
   18x Responses.

3.  Requirements on forking in SIP networks interconnecting with other
    SIP networks

   To improve interoperability with devices which do not support
   forking, a service provider shall have the possibility to use a B2BUA
   to multiplex multiple downstream dialogs into a single dialog toward
   the caller."

   The B2BUS providing such possibility must have to understand where
   the SIP dialog request is coming from and if this originating network
   or entity or UA can or cannot support multiples responses.  This
   could be also assumed by Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the
   interconnection partners.

   The main requirement is to have an entity that can receive multiples
   responses based on forked INVITES which now can be correlated to one
   single dialog towards the originating entity.

   To act proactive the B2BUA should also be possible to include and
   handle preferences (e.g. non forking wished) based on the originating
   and terminating network.

4.  Forking use cases

4.1.  Normal Forking use case

   SIP defined in RFC3261 [RFC3261]describe how forking should apply.
   Also rules for UA for responses and merged requests are defined.  But
   it is not stated how a correlation of multiples provisional responses
   should apply and what is needed.  The numbers in brackets shows the
   INVITES/early dialogs created.

   Figure 1: Example Call Flow Forking



   This figure shows the normal forking case where each UA sends a 18x
   either with or without SDP.  UAS_4 sends a final response and the
   forking proxy has to cancel all other open provisional responses.
   The 487 is sent back to the forking proxy on each early dialog (2)
   and (3) created in the UAS.

   Further possible scenarios are that two or three UAS will answer the
   call with 200 in time so that the UAC has now three open sessions
   which is not really the goal when a user would like to communicate
   with only one person.

   Figure 1 shows an normal example of forking.  With receiving 18x the
   UAC has to open transaction.  So only UAA_4 answers the dialog
   correctly.  It is task of the forking proxy to cancel the remaning
   open early dialogs

4.2.  Multiples provisional responses without SDP

   This section describes the use case where multiples 18x responses are
   sent back which doesn't contain any SDP.  This use case appear when
   the UAS instances where the INVITE is forked without any specific
   requirements and support of specific extensions like 100rel

   In this specific case the B2BUA has not to anchor the media and acts
   only as signalling B2BUA and has to maintain the signalling legs.
   This case is only needed where it is known that the UAC cannot handle
   multiples early dialogs without SDP or interconnection relations has
   to grantee that only single dialoges will pass..

      Figure 2: Example Call Flow

   The B2BUA will maintain a dialog between UAC and the incoming part of
   the B2BUA (UAS) And acts as UAC towards the terminating network
   (UAS_2, UAS_3 and UAS_4).  The INVITE F1 will have another Call-Id as
   INVITE F2, also the to-tags are different.

   The first 18x (F7) will be passed towards the UAC.  The tags (to-tag,
   from-tag), call-id etc will be stored by the B2BUA.  The 18x sent
   towards the UAC will contain the to-tag, Call-Id of INVITE F1 and the
   from-tag is generated by the B2BUA.  With arriving further 18x (F10,
   F12) the B2BUA has to store the status of the to-tags etc and will
   not forward the 180 to the UA.  The B2BUA has not to anchor
   signalling plane i.e as signalling B2BUA.

   With arriving arriving the 200OK (F14) at the B2BUA with the SDP sent
   back form UAS_4 the B2BUA will sent a 200 OK towards the UAC.  In
   this case the B2BUA re-written the to-tag, from-tan and call-id as
   already done for response 18x F7.

   As for normal forking the forking proxy is responsible for canceling
   the open dialogs with the CANCEL F16 and F20.  The CANCEL will be
   initiated with receiving/sending the final 200 OK response And ACK
   F24 finalizes the call initiation.

4.3.  Forking use case with provisional responses with SDP using 100rel

   This section describes use case where reiability of provisional
   responses will be used.  This apply in networks where announcements
   will be played in advance of call aception.  The RFC describing the
   reliability of provisional Responses RFC3262 [RFC3262] does not
   describes interactions with forking.  A B2BUA doing correlation in
   between to allows only one early dialog sent back to the UAC.  The
   B2BUA has to anchor the other early SIP Dialogs.  As long as there is
   no media interaction needed the media has not to be ancored

   This use case apply where multiples 18x responses are sent back with
   different SDP content.  This use case appear when the UAS instances
   where the INVITE is forked to will use different codecs.  E.G one UAS
   is a video phone answering with a video codec the other one a mobile
   phone and a further one using a DECT entity.

   And one or more UAS will require reliability of provisional
   responses.  Please Note that such a behavior could be also caused by
   an application server playing specific announcements which acts on
   behalf of the UAS

   There is the possibility based on the request if the 100rel mechanism
   will only be used between B2BUA and UAS or really end to end.  In
   case where the 100rel is stated as supported it is not mandatory to
   use it.  When the UAS want to have the 18x reliable it will set the
   100rel into the require header field.  In that case where a 18x is
   sent back with a 100rel required then the B2BUA may play the role of
   anchoring the media and apply the 100rel between B2BUA and UAS and
   let the UAC to B2BUA connection as unreliable.  Please note that this
   is only needed in cases where the media anchoring has to do some
   manipulation of the media e.g. transcoding of codecs.

   Where the B2BUA decides to pass the required 100rel header field the
   UAC will send then the PRACK and waits for the 200 OK.  In case there
   are further 18x with equal other type of SDP arriving at the B2BUA .
   B2BUA has to keep handle the 100rel and sent the PRACK to the UAS.

      Figure 3: Example Call Flow with 100rel


   Call will be forked to 3 end devices.  UAS_2 answers with 18x
   containing a SDP and 100rel required. 18x is passed to the UAC and
   made reliable with PRACK (F9-F13) Further 18x arrive at the B2BUA.
   The B2BUA stores the to tag for the call context.  The B2BUA will
   answer the 18x and made it reliable with PRACK.  The UPDATE sent in
   F8 and F16 is not really needed since with arriving the F27 200OK the
   finally used SDP is provided.  Then the SDP negotiated between B2BUA
   and UAS has to be negotiated with the F28 UPDATE sent towards the
   UAC.  No further activity is done towards the UAC.  The B2BUA does
   not need any media awareness for this procedures as long there is no
   need for transcoding or other manipulation of media.

   Please note that this behaviour could result in some media clipping
   since the final 200 OK is delayed due to the UPDATE/200OK cycle.
   Thus UA only cutting through media with 200OK may have some delay

   With arriving of a 200 OK at the B2BUA from UAS_4 the B2BUA has to
   construct first an UPDATE in the case that the SDP differs from the
   last UPDATE sent to the UAC.  The 200 OK received by the B2BUA and
   trigges the final response to the UAC (F27).  Editors NOTE:
   Clarification needed if the UPDATE or 200OK INVITE must be sent
   first.

   Also all other open Call legs are canceled.  F31-34 and F35-38 will
   be done in parallel.  Also ACK F39-F41 is done imediate after the UAC
   has received the 200OK INVITE.

   allows only one early dialog sent back to the UAC.  The B2BUA has to
   anchor the SIP Dialogs as well as the media reservation streams.

   Figure 4 shows the normal forking behavior when the UAC understands
   the prcondition handling.  The use case is handling two UAS where the
   INVITE is forked to.

   UAC supporting 100rel and preconditions

   F1:  INVITE     SDP offer A1 (Codec A, Codec B)
   F7:  183    (2) SDP answer A1 (Codec A)
   F13: UPDATE (2) SDP offer A2 (Codec A) UAC resources reserved
   F18: 200 OK (2) SDP Answer A2 (Codec A) UAS_2 resources reserved


   F30: 183    (3) SDP answer A1 (Codec B)
   F37: UPDATE (3) SDP offer A2 (Codec B) UAC resources reserved
   F42: 200 OK (3) SDP answer A2 (Codec B) UAS_3 resouces reserved
   F45: 200 OK (3) Final Response

   F56: INVITE (3) May appear when F1 offer was set to inactive
   Tis INVITE sets it to sendrecive
   F57: 200 OK (3) Final Response for Re-INVITE

   Figure 5 describes the use case is where the UAC sends a dialog
   request with 100rel and preconditions supported/required and the
   UAS_2 apply to the requested mechanisms.  The B2BUA has to have media
   awareness and also 3PCC capabilities.

   With applying preconditions the resource reservation needs to be
   finalized before 200 OK is sent.  In this scenario where the SIP call
   is forked and the first UAS answers with a 183 containing 100rel and
   preconditions requires an the correct SDP answer to UAC, and UAS
   starts its resource reservation mechanism (F5-F18).  The B2BUA acts
   as signalling and media-aware functionality between the Forking
   Server and the UAC.

   When the UAS_3 will send back also an 183 containing SDP and their
   required header is set to 100rel and preconditions the B2BUA has to
   reserve the resources towards the UAS (F30-F37).  This use case
   assumes that the leg between the UAC and B2BUA will not be updated to
   avoid to many codec renegotiation and resource reservation.  Thus the
   B2BUA will renegotiate when the final 200 OK will arrive at the
   B2BUA.

      Figure 5: Example Call Flow with preconditions




   F1:  INVITE SDP offer A1 (Codec A, Codec B)
   F7:  183 SDP answer A1 (Codec A)
   F13: UPDATE SDP offer A2 (Codec A) UAC resources reserved
   F28: 200 OK SDP Answer A2 (Codec A) UAS resources reserved
   F42: UPDATE SDP offer A3 (Codec B)
   F43: 200 OK SDP Answer A3 (Codec B) UAS resouces reserved
   F46: 200 OK Final Response


   Where the B2BUA decides to pass the required 100rel the UAC will send
   then the PRACK and waits for the 200 OK.  In case there are further
   18x with other type of SDP arriving at the B2BUA the UAC needs to be
   informed about change of codec.  The UAC has again to sent the PRACK.

   Editor's Note: Question is if the above described mechanism would be
   a proper mechanism since the later renegotiation + resource
   reservation could cause media clipping.  Figure 6 shows the other
   possibility.
