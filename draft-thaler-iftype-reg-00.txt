       Guidelines and Registration Procedures for Interface Types
                       draft-thaler-iftype-reg-00

Abstract

   The registration and use of Interface Types ("ifType" values)
   predated the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules,
   and so confusion has arisen about the ifType allocation process.
   This document provides updated guidelines for the definition of new
   Interface Types, for consideration by those who are defining,
   registering, or evaluating those definitions.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA IfType-MIB was originally defined in [RFC1573] as a separate
   MIB module together with the Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB) module.
   The IF-MIB has been updated and is currently specified in [RFC2863],
   but this latest IF-MIB RFC no longer contains the IANA IfType-MIB.
   Instead, the IANA IfType-MIB is now maintained as a separate module.
   Similarly, [RFC7224] created an initial INANA Interface Type YANG
   Module, but the current version is maintained by IANA.

   The current IANA IfType registries are in [iana-if-type],
   [IANAifType-MIB], and [ifType].

   Although the ifType registry was originally defined in a MIB module,
   the assignment and use of ifType values are not tied to MIB modules
   or any other management mechanism.  Interface Type values can be used
   as values of data model objects (MIB objects, YANG objects, etc.), as
   parts of a unique identifier of a data model, if any, for a given
   interface type (e.g., in an OID), or simply as values exposed by
   local APIs or UI on a device.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft              ifType Guidelines              February 2019


3.  Problems

   This document addresses the following issues:

   1.  As noted in Section 1, the former guidance was written with
       wording specific to MIB modules, and accordingly some confusion
       has resulted when using YANG modules.  This document clarifies
       that ifTypes are independent from the type of, or even existence
       of, a data model.

   2.  The use of, and requirements around, sub-layers and sub-types are
       not well understood even though good examples of both exist.
       This is discussed in Section 4.

   3.  Transmission values [ifType] have often been allocated as part of
       ifType allocation, but no guidance exists about whether a
       requester must ask for it or not, and the request form has no
       such required field.  As a result, IANA has asked the Designated
       Expert to answer this, but no relevant guidance for the
       Designated Expert has been documented.  This is discussed in
       Section 5.2.

   4.  Various documents and registries say to submit requests via
       email, but a web form exists for submitting requests, which has
       caused some confusion around which is to be used.  This is
       discussed in Section 6.

4.  Interface Sub-Layers and Sub-Types

   When multiple sub-layers exist below the network layer, each sub-
   layer can be represented by its own row in the ifTable with its own
   ifType, with the ifStackTable being used to identify the upward and
   downward multiplexing relationships between rows.  Section 3.1.1 of
   [RFC2863] provides more discussion, and Section 3.1.2 of that RFC
   provides guidance for defining interface sub-layers.  More recent
   experience shows that these guidelines are phrased in a way that is
   now too restrictive, since at the time [RFC2863] was written, MIB
   modules were the dominant data model.

   This document clarifies that such guidance also applies to YANG
   modules.

   Some ifTypes define sub-types.  For example, the tunnel(131) ifType
   defines sub-types, where each IANAtunnelType can have its own MIB
   and/or YANG module with protocol-specific information, but there is
   enough in common that some information is exposed in a generic IP
   Tunnel MIB corresponding to the tunnel(131) ifType.

Internet-Draft              ifType Guidelines              February 2019


   For requests that involve multiple sub-layers below the network
   layer, requests MUST include (or reference) a discussion of the
   multiplexing relationships between sub-layers, ideally with a
   diagram.  Various well-written examples exist of such definitions,
   including [RFC3637] section 3.4.1, [RFC4087] section 3.1.1, and
   [RFC5066] section 3.1.1.

   Definers of sub-layers and sub-types should consider which model is
   more appropriate for their needs.  A sub-layer is generally used
   whenever either a dynamic relationship (i.e., which instances layer
   over which other instances can change over time) or a multiplexing
   relationship exists with another sub-layer.  A sub-type can be used
   when neither of these are true, but where one interface type data is
   conceptually a subclass of another interface type, as far as a
   management data model is concerned.

   PROPOSED CLARIFICATION/ELABORATION: The intent of an interface type
   or sub-type is that its definition should be sufficient to identify
   an interoperable protocol.  In some cases, a protocol might be
   defined in a way that is not sufficient to provide interoperability
   with other compliant implementations of that protocol.  In such a
   case, an ifType definition should discuss whether specific
   instantiations (or profiles) of behavior should use a sub-layer model
   (e.g., each vendor might layer the protocol over its own sub-layer
   that provides the missing details), or a sub-type model (i.e., each
   vendor might subclass the protocol without any layering
   relationship).  If a sub-type model is more appropriate, then the
   data model for the protocol might include a sub-type identifier so
   that management software can discover objects specific to the
   subtype.  In either case, such discussion is important to guide
   definers of a data model for the more specific information (i.e., a
   lower sub-layer or a subtype), as well as the Designated Expert that
   must review requests for any such ifTypes or sub-types.

5.  Registration

   The IANA policy (using terms defined in [RFC5226]) for registration
   is Expert Review.  The role of the Designated Expert in the procedure
   is to raise possible concerns about wider implications of proposals
   for use and deployment of interface types.  While it is recommended
   for the responsible Area Director and the IESG to take into
   consideratoin the Designated Expert opinions, nothing in the
   procedure empowers the Designated Expert to override properly
   arrived-at IETF or working group consensus.

Internet-Draft              ifType Guidelines              February 2019


5.1.  Procedures

   Someone wishing to register a new ifType value MUST:

   1.  Check the IANA registry to see whether there is already an entry
       that could easily satisfy the modeling and functional
       requirements for the requested entry.  If there is already such
       an entry, use it or update the existing specification.  Text in
       an Internet-Draft, or part of some other some other permanently
       available, stable specification may be written to clarify the
       usage of an existing entry or entries for the desired purpose.

   2.  Check the IANA registry to see whether there is already some
       other entry with the desired name.  if there is already an
       unrelated entry under the name, choose a different name.

   3.  Prepare a registration request using the template specified in
       Section 5.3.  The registration request can be contained in an
       Internet-Draft, submitted alone, or as part of some other
       permanently available, stable, specification.  The registration
       request can also be submitted in some other form (as part of
       another document or as a stand-alone document), but the
       registration request will be treated as an "IETF Contribution"
       under the guidelines of [RFC5378].

   4.  Submit the registration request (or pointer to document
       containing it) to IANA at iana@iana.org or via the web form at
       https://www.iana.org/form/iftype .

   Upon receipt of a registration request, the following steps MUST be
   followed:

   1.  IANA checks the submission for completeness; if required
       information is missing or any citations are not correct, IANA
       will reject the registration request.  A registrant can resubmit
       a corrected request if desired.

   2.  IANA requests Expert Review of the registration request against
       the corresponding guidelines from this document.

   3.  The Designated Expert will evaluate the request against the
       criteria.

   4.  Once the Designated Expert approves registration, IANA updates
       [ifType], [IANAifType-MIB], and [iana-if-type] to show the
       registration.  When adding values to the ianaiftype-mib, IANA
       should verify that the updated MIB module is syntactically

Internet-Draft              ifType Guidelines              February 2019


       correct before publishing the update.  There are various existing
       tools or web sites that can be used to do this verification.

   5.  If instead the Designated Expert does not approve registration
       (e.g., for any of the reasons in [RFC5226] section 3), a
       registrant can resubmit a corrected request if desired, or the
       IESG can override the Designated Expert and approve it per the
       process in Section 5.3 of [RFC5226].

5.2.  Media-specific OID-subtree assignments

   The current ianaiftype-mib notes:

      The relationship between the assignment of ifType values and of
      OIDs to particular media-specific MIBs is solely the purview of
      IANA and is subject to change without notice.  Quite often, a
      media-specific MIB's OID-subtree assignment within MIB-II's
      'transmission' subtree will be the same as its ifType value.
      However, in some circumstances this will not be the case, and
      implementors must not pre-assume any specific relationship between
      ifType values and transmission subtree OIDs.

   CURRENT: For every ifType registration, the corresponding
   transmission number value should be registered or marked "Reserved."

   PROPOSED: For future ifType assignments, an OID-subtree assignment
   MIB-II's 'transmission' subtree will be made with the same value.

   RATIONALE: (1) This saves effort in the future since if a
   transmission number is later needed, no IANA request is needed that
   would then require another Expert Review. (2) The transmision
   numbering space is not scarce, so there seems little need to reserve
   the number for a different purpose than what the ifType is for.

5.3.  Registration Template

   This template describes the fields that MUST be supplied in a
   registration request suitable for adding to the registry:

   Label for IANA ifType requested:  As explained in Section 7.1.1 of
      [RFC2578], a label for a named-number enumeration must consist of
      one or more letters or digits, up to a maximum of 64 characters,
      and the initial character must be a lower-case letter.  (However,
      labels longer than 32 characters are not recommended.)  Note that
      hyphens are not allowed.

   Name of IANA ifType requested:  A short description (e.g., a protocol
      name), suitable to appear in a comment in the registry.

Internet-Draft              ifType Guidelines              February 2019


   Description of the proposed use of the IANA ifType:  Requesters MUST
      include answers, either directly or via a link to some document
      with the answers, to the following questions in the explanation of
      the proposed use of the IANA IfType:

      o  How would IP run over your ifType?

      o  Would there be another interface sublayer between your ifType
         and IP?

      o  Would your ifType be vendor-specific or proprietary?  (If so,
         the label MUST start with a string that shows that.  For
         example, if your company's name or acronym is xxx, then the
         ifType label would be something like xxxSomeIfTypeLabel.)

      o  (ADDED) Would your ifType require or allow vendor-specific
         extensions?  If so, would the vendor use their own ifType in
         sub-layer below the requested ifType, or a sub-type of the
         ifType, or some other mechanism?

   Reference, Internet-Draft, or Specification:  A link to some document
      is required.

   Additional information or comments:  Optionally any additional
      comments for IANA or the Designated Expert.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This entire document is about IANA considerations.

   CURRENT: The registries say to use email, but a web form exists
   (https://www.iana.org/form/iftype), which is an apparent
   contradiction.  Should IANA require using the form?
   Or require using email?  Or accept submisions either way?

   PROPOSED: In addition, IANA is requested to make the following
   changes:

   1.  [IANAifType-MIB] currently says: "Requests for new values should
       be made to IANA via email (iana&iana.org)."  This should be
       updated to instead say: "Requests for new values should be made
       at https://www.iana.org/form/iftype or by email (iana&iana.org)."

   2.  [iana-if-type] currently says: "Requests for new values should be
       made to IANA via email (iana&iana.org)."  This should be updated
       to instead say: "Requests for new values should be made at
       https://www.iana.org/form/iftype or by email (iana&iana.org)."
