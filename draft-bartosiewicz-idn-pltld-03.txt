Abstract

    This document describes rules of Internationalized Domain Name
    registration under PL-TLD. All the rules are based on the idea that
    the Registry registers the ACE label version of the domain name
    instead of IDN in UNICODE. This document also includes the list of
    accepted Unicode codepoints for IDN registration uder ".PL".

Introduction

    NASK is the PL-TLD registry with the liberal policy of the
    internationalized domain name registration.


1. Main concepts

    The Policy of the IDN-registration under .PL is liberal and is based
    on the following concepts:
    -NASK accepts only the proper ACE labels  (according to [3], [8] and
    [9]) which begin with the "xn--" prefix and contain only ASCII
    characters
    -the received string after the ToUnicode operation (according to
    Section  4.2 of [4] and Section 6.2 of [3]) applied to the ACE
    label MUST only include codepoints [5] from the following set:
    U+002D                HYPEN-MINUS
    U+0030..U+0039        DIGIT ZERO .. DIGIT 9

2. The IDN influence on Registry

    Registry's IDN registration policy described in Section 1 has no
    influence on Registry activities especially on invocing, whois and
    registration process. The Registry does not provide sunrise period
    for IDN registrations.


2.1. The subject of the contract

    The subject of the contract between Registry and Registrant is the
    ACE version of the IDN domain name.
    Registry stores ACE version in the zone files, whois and other
    internal databases. Registy MUST NOT store the IDN version of
    the domain name.


2.2. Variant tables

    Registry does not implement variant tables and bundles (concept of
    variant tables and bundles is described in [6])

2.3. Influence on EPP implementation.

    There is no influence on EPP implementation [7].


3. The release date

    The release date for Polish characters registration under .PL
    is September the 11th, 2003.
    The release date for German characters registration under .PL
    is October the 6th, 2003.
    The release date for remaining characters registration uder .PL
    is October the 20th, 2003.



4. Terminology

    Characters in the document are given as their Unicode codepoints on
    U+XXXX format (X is a hexadecimal digit).

    "Registry" in this document is equivalent to PL-TLD Registry "NASK".

    "ACE label" and "ACE prefix" is defined in Section 2 of [4].

    "NAMEPREP" is defined in [1], "PUNYCODE", "ToUnicode" and "ToASCII"
    is defined on [3].
