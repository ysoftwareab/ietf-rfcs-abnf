Abstract

   In the deployment of BGP/MPLS VPN,the PE(Provider Edge)Device should
   maintain all the VPN routes of the VPNs which it belong to.When there 
   are many VPNs converged by a PE,and the capacity of PE is relevant
   limited,then the bottleneck will be encountered.Another problem is 
   that the current BGP/MPLS VPN model is something of a "Plane Modle"
   where the demand of the performance of the PE device are all the 
   same no matter which layer the PE device is belongs to.However,the 
   typical network is "Core-Convergence-Access(Edge)" model,and the 
   performance of the device is superior in Core Layer and inferior in 
   Access Layer,and the scale of network is large in Access Layer and 
   small in Core Layer,the routes are converged in every layer,so in 
   current "Plane Modle",when PE device push to the edge layer,it has 
   to maintain more VPN routes,this makes it difficult to extend the PE

1. Introduction

   This document defines an model of Hierarchy of Provider Edge Device 
   in BGP/MPLS VPN,where Hierarchy of Provider Edge Device can be 
   composed of several device and every device take on the different 
   part,partake the function of the former concentrative PE,we call 
   this model "Hierarchy Model",In this model the demand of 
   performance in Routing and Switching is strict to the PE device in 
   High layer,loose to the PE device in edge layer.
   
   PE device can connect to not only the Customer Edge(CE) device,but 
   also a PE device,or even more generally an MPLS VPN network,and the
   connected PE devices formed the "Hierarchy of PE",and the PE device
   which replace the former position of CE device in "Plane Model" is 
   called Under-layer PE,UPE in short,and the PE device which UPE is 
   connected to is called Superstratum PE,SPE in short,this 
   architiecture is called Hierarchy of PE,HoPE in short.and the 
   architecture figure is as follows(figure 1):

   Several UPE and SPE formed the Hierarchy of PE,which provide the 
   conventional function of PE in "Plane Model",and their respective
   functions are as follows:
   
   UPE maintains only the routes of the VPN sites which is directly 
   connected to UPE,it don't maintain the routes of the remote VPN 
   sites or only maintain the aggregate routes,SPE maintain the routes of
   all the sites directly connected to this SPE and the sites directly 
   connected to UPE which directly connected to this SPE.
   
   UPE distribute the inner MPLS labels for the routes in the sites 
   directly connected to it,and advertise the labels to SPE with the

Draft     <draft-libin-Hierarchy-pe-bgp-mpls-vpn-00.txt>  November 2002


   VPN routes through MP-BGP,SPE don't advertise the routes in the 
   remote sites to UPE,it only advertise the VRF default route or 
   aggregate route to UPE,and the route is concomitant with the MPLS 
   label.
   
   MP-IBGP or MP-EBGP can be applied between UPE and SPE,while MP-IBGP
   is applied,SPE should be the Route Reflector(RR) for all the UPEs 
   collected to it,and UPE play the role of Client of this RR,BUT SPE
   doesn't act as the RR for other PEs. If MP-EBGP is applied 
   between MP-EBGP,the AS number of the UPEs should be the private AS
   number(64512~65535).In fact,the Hierarchy of PE can be handles with
   the rules of Confederation,in which case every confederation AS is 
   composed of only one BGP Speaker,the UPE collected to the SPE.
   
   The packet forwarding between SPE and UPE is based on the label,so
   only one interface is needed to connected to each other,this 
   interface can be a physical interface,or sub-interface,such as VLAN,
   PVC,tunnel such as GRE or LSP.When tunnel is applied between UPE and
   SPE,an IP network or MPLS network can be deployed between them.
   
   Hierarchy of PE takes on all the functions of the normal PE,
   there is no difference between them when looked outside,so this 
   "special" PE can coexist with other PEs in the MPLS network.
   
2. Working Principle

   This section specifies the working principle of Hierarchy of PE 
   including the maintaining of VPN routes,distribution of MPLS labels,
   and packet forwarding.
   
2.1 VPN routes

   SPE can establish MP-BGP neighborship with UPE,if they are 
   administered by the same service provider,they can be MP-IBGP
   neighborship,otherwise should establish the MP-EBGP neighorship.  
     
   In the MP-IBGP case,if there exists the sites of the different UPEs
   collected to an SPE belong to the same VPN,SPE as the Route Reflector
   for the relevant UPEs,otherwise SPE act as the convergent PE for all
   the UPEs collected to it.Route-Target lists are used to select the 
   right VPN routes from other PEs as the normal "Plane Modle" 
   BGP/MPLS VPN(RFC 2547bis),while only SPE will exchange the route 
   information with other PEs,UPE should send the import route 
   target list to SPE,SPE converge the route target lists and derive 
   the HoPE-wide import route target list,with this HoPE-wide import 
   route target,SPE can select the right VPN routes which belong to the 
   VPNs which have the sites connected the SPE directly or through UPE.
   
   This HoPE-wide import route target list can be configured staticly 
   or derived dynamically between SPE and UPEs.The dynamic mechanism is
   as follows:


Libin, et al.  Hierarchy of PE Device in  BGP/MPLS VPN         [Page 4]

Draft     <draft-libin-Hierarchy-pe-bgp-mpls-vpn-00.txt>  November 2002


   
   UPE advertise the ORF(Outbound Route Filter)[BGP-ORF] to SPE through
   Route Refresh(RFC 2918) message,and an extended community list is
   included in the ORF item,the content of the extended community list 
   is the aggregation of the import route target lists of all the VRFs
   in the UPE,and SPE converge all the import route target lists 
   received from the UPEs connected to SPE and derive the HoPE-wide
   import route target list.
   
   In MP-EBGP case,SPE should derive the HoPE-wide import route target
   list all the same with the mechanism as above.In general,UPE should
   adopt the private AS number in VPN routes advertised to SPE.When SPE
   advertised the routes to other PEs,SPE should omitted the private AS.
   
   The scheme in which SPE connected to part of UPEs through MP-IBGP,
   and to the other part UPEs through MP-EBGP is permitted.   
   
   UPE selects its own VPN routes by match its own import route target
   list with the export route target list attached with VPN routes
   respectively. 

   SPE advertised the VRF default route or aggregate routes(by which 
   UPE transfer the VPN packet to SPE) to UPE,this default VRF route 
   can be formed dynamically or configured statically.When formed 
   dynamically,it can be filtered by the ORF mechanism mentioned above.
 
2.2 Control Flow(Route Advertising and Label Distribution)
  
   This section specifies the mechanism the network distribute the  
   labels for the routes in the VPN sites.The following figure(Figure 2) 
   signifies the control flow between VPN1 site1 and VPN1 SITE2,the 
   control flows(route and label distribution) in the two direction are
   different,there are four steps in every direction,labeled (1) through
   (4) in the direction from VPN1 SITE2 to VPN1 site1,and labeled (5)
   through (8) in the direction from VPN1 site1 to VPN1 SITE2.

  In Figure 2,the meanings of (1) through (8) are as follows:
  Label (1) through (4) specifies the procedure in the direction from
  VPN1 SITE2 to VPN1 Site1:
  
  (1) CE2 advertise a route in the VPN1 SITE2 to PE;
  
  (2) PE distribute an inner MPLS label for this route;PE advertise this 
  route to SPE through MP-BGP with the inner label,and the relevant 
  export route target list attached;
  
  (3.a) SPE match the export route target list in the received route with 
  the HoPE-wide import route target list to decide whether or not 
  import the VPN route,in this case,they can be matched,then SPE will 
  import the received VPN route.
  
  (3.b)At the same time SPE will match the 
  export route target list in the received route with the import route 
  target list advertised by VRF in UPEs connected to SPE,in this case,
  the import route target list of the VRF in UPE correspond to VPN1 
  Site1(called VRF1) will match,then SPE will advertise the default VRF1 
  route to UPE,with the inner MPLS label distributed by PE attached;
  
  (4) UPE advertise this route to CE1 through the route protocol(RIP,
  OSPF,BGP,or default route),
    
  Label (5) through (8) specifies the procedure in the direction from
  VPN1 SITE2 to VPN1 Site1:
  
  (5) CE1 advertise a route in the VPN1 site1 to UPE; 
   
  (6) UPE distribute an inner label for this route;UPE advertise 
  this route to SPE through MP-BGP with the inner label;
  
  (7) SPE replace the inner label distributed by UPE with another inner 
  label distributed by SPE,then advertise this route to PE through 
  MP-BGP with the new inner label attached;
  
  (8) PE distributed the route to CE2 with no label attached.
  
  Of course,the LSP should be established between SPE and PE in two 
  directions respectively,This mechanism is the same as RFC 2547bis.
  The procedure of forwarding VPN packet with the two labels detailed 
  in section 2.3
  
2.3 Data Flow(Label Operation and Packet Forwarding)  

   This section specifies the mechanism of forwarding the VPN packets in
   the network with the route and label information derived by section 
   2.2. The following figure(Figure 3) signifies the data flows between

   VPN1 site1 and VPN1 SITE2,the data flows(Label Operation and Packet 
   Forwarding) in the two direction are different,there are five steps 
   in every direction,labeled (1) through (5) in the direction from 
   VPN1 SITE2 to VPN1 site1,and labeled (6) through (10) in the 
   direction from VPN1 site1 to VPN1 SITE2.

                 |------->|------>|--------|----->|----->|
   
           Figure 3: Data Flow(Label Operation and Packet Forwarding)  

  In Figure 3,the meanings of (1) through (10) are as follows:
  Label (1) through (5) specifies the forwarding procedure in the 
  direction of VPN1 Site1 visit VPN1 SITE2:
  
  (1) When the VPN packet of VPN1 Site1 visit VPN1 SITE2 arrived to CE1,
  CE1 forward the packet to UPE based on the default route or the 
  route derive from dynamic route protocol between CE1 and UPE 
  specified in the (4) of section 2.2.
  
  (2) UPE push the inner label based on the default VRF route,forward
  the VPN packet to SPE,the inner label and the default VRF route are
  specified in the (3) of section 2.2.
  
  (3) SPE POP the inner label pushed by UPE specified in (2) above,and
  look up the VRF route,push the new inner label which distributed by 
  PE specified by (2) of section 2.2,then push the outer label 
  distributed by P and forward the VPN packet to P,in backbone network,
  all the P router in the path of LSP from SPE to PE swap the outer 
  label and forward the VPN packet through this LSP until the packet 
  arrived to PE,or optionally the P router pen-ultimate hop the label.
  
  (4) The P router pen-ultimate hop to PE POP the outer label,forward 
  the VPN packet to PE.
  
  (5) PE POP the inner label,forward the VPN packet to CE2,then CE2 
  forward the VPN packet to the VPN1 SITE2 with the route in this site.
   
  Label (6) through (10) specifies the forwarding procedure in the 
  direction of VPN1 SITE2 visit VPN1 Site1:
  
  (6) When the VPN packet of VPN1 SITE2 visit VPN1 Site1 arrived to CE2,

  CE2 forward the packet to PE based on the default route or the route 
  derive from dynamic route protocol between CE2 and PE specified in 
  the (8) of section 2.2.
  
  (7) PE push the inner label distributed by SPE specified in (7) of 
  section 2.2 based on the VRF route,then push the outer label 
  distributed by P and forward the VPN packet to P,in backbone network,
  all the P router in the path of LSP from PE to SPE swap the outer 
  label and forward the VPN packet through this LSP until the P router 
  pen-ultimate hop to SPE.
  
  (8) The P router optioanlly pen-ultimate hop to SPE POP the outer 
  label,forward the VPN packet to SPE.
  
  (9) SPE swap the inner label in the VPN packet replace the inner 
  label distributed by SPE with the new inner label distributed by UPE
  specified in (6) of section 2.2,then forward the VPN packet to UPE.
  
  (10) UPE POP the new inner label,forward the VPN packet to CE1,then 
  CE1 forward the VPN packet to the VPN1 Site1 with the route in this 
  site.

3. Interface between UPE and SPE

   UPE can connect to SPE with any type of interface and sub-interface,
   even with tunnel interface,in this case,UPE can connect with SPE
   through an IP or MPLS network,and because SPE and UPE are MP-BGP 
   peers,the routes can be advertise directly through TCP connection. 
   In MP-EBGP case,UPE and SPE can set up EBGP peers across the 
   IP network or MPLS network by Multi-hop EBGP,when UPE or SPE 
   forwarding the VPN packets with the label,they must pass a tunnel,
   if the tunnel is GRE,MPLS encapsulation must be supported;If the 
   tunnel is LSP,the network between UPE ang SPE must be MPLS network,
   LDP/CR-LDP or RSVP-TE must be supported in UPE and SPE.
   
4. Nesting of HoPE

   One HoPE can be composed of a SPE and UPES connected to the SPE, 
   or be composed of a high-level SPE and HoPEs connected the high 
   level SPE and and build up a new HoPE.This build is called nesting 
   of HoPE,and this kind of nesting can be done for many times.Thus the 
   former HoPE connect to the high-level SPE as a role of UPE,and the 
   new HoPE can connect a single UPE too.Figure 4 in the following 
   signifies a three-layer HoPE,and call the PE in the middle layer as 
   MPE(Middle-level PE).

   Between SPE and MPE,and between MPE and UPE run MP-BGP,if run 
   MP-IBGP,then SPE worked as the route reflector for all the MPE,and
   MPEs worked as the route reflector for all the UPEs,and MP-BGP 
   advertise all the VPN routes of the underlayer PEs to the upperlayer
   PE,and advertise the default VRF route or the aggregate route of the
   upperlayer to the underlayer PE. So SPE maintains all the VPN routes
   of the whole HoPE,and the MPE maintains the VPN routes of UPEs
   connected to this MPE.UPE maintain the VPN routes of sites connected
   to this UPE.
   
   SPE advertise the default VRF routes with the label attached to MPE,
   MPE replaces this label with the new label,and advertise this route 
   with the new label attached to UPE.
   
   The upperlayer PE should create a HoPE-wide global import route 
   target list,filter the VPN routes that don't belong to the VPNs
   connected to this upperlayer PE.MPE converge all the import route 
   target lists of the UPEs connected to this MPE,and SPE converge all
   the converged import route target lists of the MPEs connected to 
   this SPE.And this convergence can be configured statically or 
   derived dynamically,in the latter case,MPE should forward the import
   route target list of MPE to SPE through ORF.
   
   When the VPN packet from the local site of HoPE is forwarded to UPE,

   route or aggregate route to SPE,PUSH a new label forward the packet 
   to SPE,SPE POP this label,look up the VRF forwarding table,PUSH the 
   inner label,and the outer label the P router distribute for this 
   route,then follow the RFC 2547bis forwarding procedure.
   
   Because MPE has distributes the inner label for the destination 
   address of the VPN packet from the remote site,when the remote VPN
   packet is forwarded to SPE through the MPLS network following the 
   RFC 2547bis forwarding procedure. SPE swap the inner label,forward 
   this packet to MPE,for the same reason,MPE swap the inner label and 
   forward this packet to UPE,then UPE POP the inner label and forward 
   this packet to the local site.
5. Multi-Homing UPE

   One UPE can connect to several SPEs,in this case UPE is called
   Multi-Homing UPE,all the SPEs advertise the default VRF routes to 
   this UPE,and UPE select the best one or treat them as ECMP(Equal
   Cost Multi-Path) and share the load among them.UPE advertised the
   VPN routes to all the SPEs,it can advertises all the VPN routes to
   all the SPEs,or it can advertises one part of VPN routes to one SPE,
   the other part to the other and shares the load among the SPEs.
   
6. Backdoor link between UPEs

   A kind of backdoor link can be setup between UPEs,so that the sites 
   connected to these two UPEs can communicate with each other directly
   without passing through the SPE.And these UPEs can be those connect 
   to the same SPE,or can be those connect to the different SPE,these 
   UPEs advertise the VPN routes to each other through MP-BGP,The 
   control flow and data flow are the same with RFC 2547bis Procedures,
   and even theu can cross a network,and the packet can pass through a 
   tunnel such as GRE or LSP.
   
7. The Forwarding Procedure in Some Special Cases

   In one case that SPE connect two UPEs called UPE and UPE2,and these
   two UPEs connect two sites called site1 and site2 respectively,and 
   site1 and site2 belong to the same VPN and visit to each other 
   through SPE.The forwarding procedure is as follows:When the packet 
   sent from site1 arrived to UPE,UPE push the label based on the 
   default route and forward it to SPE,SPE POP this label,then look up
   the VRF route table,PUSH the label distribute by UPE2 and forward it 
   to UPE2,and UPE2 POP the label,forward it to site2,and in the 
   opposite direction,vise versa.
   
   In another case that SPE connect one UPE and one CE,CE connect to
   site1,UPE connect to site2,site1 and site2 belong to the same VPN.
   The forwarding procedure is as follows:
   
   (1)When the packet with no label sent from site1 arrived to SPE 
   through CE, SPE look up VRF route table,and push the label distributed 
   by UPE,forward it to UPE,UPE POP this label,forward it to Site2.
   
   (2)When the packet originated from Site2 arrived to UPE,UPE transfer
   the packet to SPE on the basis of default or aggregate route,SPE then 
   look up the VRF route table,POP the label,forward it to Site1 as an IP
   packet.

8. Security Consideration

   The level of security provided by this architecture is identical to 
   that provided by the RFC 2547bis,there is no security problem 
   introduced.
