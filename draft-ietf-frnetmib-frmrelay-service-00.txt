Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service Level Defs MIB   February 7, 2000


1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

       o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

       o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
           the purpose of management. The first version of this
           Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and
           described in RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
           second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5],
           RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

       o   Message protocols for transferring management information.
           The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
           SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
           SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
           track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
           [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message
           protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC
           2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

       o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
           first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats
           is described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
           operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC
           1905 [13].

       o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
           and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
           2575 [15].



   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in

   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2.  Overview

   This MIB addresses the items required to manage the Frame Relay
   Forum's Implementation Agreement for Service Level Definitions
   (FRF.13 [17]).  At present, this applies to these values of the
   ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:


       o   frameRelay (32)

       o   frameRelayService (44)


   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB.


2.1.  Frame Relay Service Level Definitions

   The frame relay service level definitions address specific
   characteristics of a frame relay service that can be used to
   facilitate the following tasks:

       o   Evaluation of frame relay service providers, offerings or
           products.

       o   Measurement of Quality of Service.

       o   Enforcement of Service Level Agreements.

       o   Planning or describing a frame relay network.


   The following parameters are defined in FRF.13 [17] as a sufficient
   set of values to accomplish the tasks previously stated.

       o   Delay - The amount of time elapsed, in microseconds, from the
           time a frame exits the source to the time it reaches the
           destination.  NOTE: FRF.13 [17] defines this value in terms
           of milliseconds.

       o   Frame Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the number of frames
           delivered to the destination versus the number of frames sent



Expires August 2000      Steinberger & Nicklass                 [Page 4]


Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service Level Defs MIB   February 7, 2000


           by the source.  This ratio can be further divided by
           inspecting either only the frames within the CIR or only the
           frames in excess of the CIR.

       o   Data Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the amount of data
           delivered to the destination versus the amount of data sent
           by the source. This ratio can be further divided by
           inspecting either only the data within the CIR or only the
           data in excess of the CIR.

       o   Service Availability - The amount of time the frame relay
           service was not unavailable.  There are three types of
           availability statistics defined in FRF.13 [17]: Virtual
           Connection Availability, Mean Time to Repair, and Mean Time
           Between Service Outages.  The later two require information
           about the scheduled outage time.  It is assumed that this
           information will be maintained by the network management
           software, so it is not included in the MIB.


           Consult FRF.13 [17] for more details.

2.2.  Terminology


    o   CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber
        data rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to
        deliver under normal network conditions. [18]

    o   DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier. [18]

    o   Logical Port - This term is used to model the Frame Relay
        "interface" on a device. [18]

    o   NNI - Network to Network Interface. [18]

    o   Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that
        has its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at
        subscription time. [18]

    o   Reference Point (RP) - The point of reference within the network
        model at which the calculations or data collection takes place.

    o   UNI - User to Network Interface. [18]

2.3.  Network Model

   The basic model, as illustrated in figure 1 below, contains two frame
   relay DTE endpoints connected to a network cloud via a frame relay
   UNI interface. The network cloud can contain zero or more internal
   frame relay NNI connections that interconnect multiple networks.  The
   calculations and data collection can be performed at any reference
   point within the network.

                    Frame Relay Network Reference Model

2.4.  Reference Points

   The collection and calculations of the service level definitions
   apply to two reference points within the network. These two points
   are the locations where the frames are referenced in the collection
   of the service level specific information. The reference points used
   in the MIB are shown in figure 2 below. For completeness, the MIB
   also allows for a proprietary reference point which can exist
   anywhere in the network that is not a previously defined reference
   point. Its meaning is insignificant unless defined by the device
   manufacturer.

Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service Level Defs MIB   February 7, 2000


   The MIB variables frsldPvcCtrlSrcRP and frsldPvcCtrlDstRP allow the
   user to view and, if supported, configure the reference points at
   which the calculations occur.  These variables are specific to the
   device on which they are located.  Frame relay devices act as both
   frame sources and frame destinations. The definitions in this MIB
   apply to the interaction of a pair of devices on the network path.
   The same device can potentially use different reference points for
   calculation and collection of the statistics based on whether the
   referenced frame is sent or received by the device. When the device
   is acting as a frame source, the value of frsldPvcCtrlSrcRP reflects
   the reference point  used for all source calculations pertaining to
   the specified PVC. When the device is acting as a frame destination,
   the value of frsldPvcCtrlDstRP reflects the reference point used for
   all destination calculations pertaining to the  specified PVC.

   For example, FRF.13 [17] defines an Edge-to-Edge Egress Queue
   measurement domain as a domain in which measurement is performed
   between an Ingress Reference Point and an Egress Queue Input
   Reference Point. For this domain between a source device and a
   destination device, the value of frsldPvcCtrlSrcRP for the source
   device would be set to ingRP(2) and the value of frsldPvcCtrlDstRP
   for the destination device would be set to eqiRP(4).  While it is
   usually the case that the reference points would simply swap when
   looking at frames going in the opposite direction, there is no
   requirement for them to do so.

2.5.  Measurement Methodology

   This document neither recommends nor suggests a method of
   implementation.  This is left to the device manufacturer and should
   be independent of the data that is actually collected.

   Periodic collection of this data can be performed through either
   polling of the data table, use of the sample tables or use of the
   user history group of RFC 2021 [19].

2.6.  Collection Location

   In order to facilitate implementation independence, the location at
   which the calculations are performed must be reported.  In that these
   statistics correlate information between two devices (a source-
   destination node pair), there are multiple locations at which this
   calculation can actually take place.  These locations are specified
   using the MIB variables frsldPvcCtrlDelayLoc and
   frsldPvcCtrlDeliveryLoc.  The potential values for these variables
   have the following meanings:

       o   source - All calculations are performed at the source node

           given statistics from the destination node.  This means that
           the source node collects information from the destination
           node and reports values that are consistent with the current
           state of the network. There may be some delay in updating
           these values due to the cross-network correlation. However,
           all values should be synchronized such that they act as if
           collected simultaneously. The method of cross-network
           communication is implementation independent.

           The network node being queried is acting as the source node.
           The network node at the far end of the PVC is the destination
           node.  The values of the "offered" statistics are associated
           with those frames sent by this node. The values of the
           "delivered" statistics are associated with those frames
           actually reaching the destination node. The one-way delay
           statistics are associated with packets sent from this node to
           the far-end node. The round-trip delay statistics are
           associated with packets sent by this node and received by
           this node.

       o   destination - All calculations are performed at the
           destination node given statistics from the source node.  This
           means that the destination node collects information from the
           source node and reports values that are consistent with the
           current state of the network. There may be some delay in
           updating these values due to the cross-network correlation.
           However, all values should be synchronized such that they act
           as if collected simultaneously.  The method of cross-network
           communication is implementation independent.

           The network node being queried is acting as the destination
           node.  The network node at the far end of the PVC is the
           source node.  The values of the "offered" statistics are
           associated with those frames sent by the source node. The
           values of the "delivered" statistics are associated with
           those frames actually received by this node. The one-way
           delay statistics are associated with packets sent by the far
           end node and received by this node.  The round-trip delay
           statistics are associated with packets sent by the far end
           node, received by the far end node and reported to this node.

       o   intermediate - All calculations are performed at some
           intermediate node such as a probe.  This means that both the
           source and the destination node are referenced such that the
           values reported are consistent with the current state of the
           network. There may be some delay in updating these values due
           to the cross-network correlation. However, all values should
           be synchronized such that they act as if collected

           simultaneously.  The method of cross-network communication is
           implementation independent.

           The network node being queried is acting as neither the
           source nor the destination node.  The network node at one far
           end of the PVC is the source node while the other far end
           node is the destination node.  The values of the "offered"
           statistics are associated with those frames sent by the
           source node. The values of the "delivered" statistics are
           associated with those frames actually received by the
           destination node.  The one-way delay statistics are
           associated with packets traveling from the source reference
           point to the destination reference point.  The round-trip
           delay statistics are associated with packets that leave and
           return to this node.

       o   distributed - There is no cross-network communication
           performed by the device in the collection of statistics.  The
           values in the MIB objects on this device reflect only
           information that this device knows about itself.  The source
           specific values reflect information about this device when it
           acts as the source.  Likewise, the destination specific
           values reflect information about this device when it acts as
           a destination.  It is up to the network management software
           to communicate to each device to collect the statistics.

           The network node being queried is acting as both a source and
           a destination node for separate source-destination node
           pairs. The values of the "offered" statistics are associated
           with those frames sent by this node and are valid in the
           context of the source-destination node pair for which this
           node is the source. The values of the "delivered" statistics
           are associated with those frames actually received by this
           node and are valid in the context of the source-destination
           node pair for which this node is the destination.  All delay
           statistics for this node are deferred to the node at the far
           end.



2.7.  Use of MIB in Calculation of Service Level Definitions

   The MIB variables can be used to calculate statistics defined in
   FRF.13 [17].  For the following explanation, it is assumed that
   statistics can both be collected from the same device, i.e. the
   location type is not distributed.  Should the location be
   distributed, the manager should collect the source information from
   the source node and the network information from the network node.

   Otherwise, all information should be collected from the single device
   representing the correct end of the PVC.

2.7.1.  Delay

   The frame transfer delay is defined as the amount of time elapsed, in
   microseconds, from the time a frame exits the source to the time it
   reaches the destination. The average delay can be found using the
   frsldPvcDataDelayAvg MIB variable. The delay may be calculated as
   either round trip or one way, and this information is held in the
   frsldPvcCtrlDelayType MIB variable. Should the delay be calculated as
   round trip, the value of frsldPvcDataDelayAvg represents the average
   of the total delays of the round trips.  In this case, the manager
   should dive the value returned by the agent by two to obtain the
   frame transfer delay. In the case that frsldPvcCtrlDelayType is
   oneWay, the value of frsldPvcDataDelayAvg represents the average of
   the frame transfer delays.

2.7.2.  Frame Delivery Ratio

   The frame delivery ratio is defined as the total number of frames
   delivered to the destination divided by the frames offered by the
   source.  The destination values can be obtained using FrDeliveredC
   and FrDeliveredE. The source values can be obtained using FrOfferedC
   and FrOfferedE.

                          FrDeliveredC + FrDeliveredE
   Frame Delivery Ratio = ---------------------------
                            FrOfferedC + FrOfferedE

                                     FrDeliveredC

   Excess Frame Delivery Ratio =  ------------
                                   FrOfferedE

2.7.3.  Data Delivery Ratio

   The data delivery ratio is defined as the total amount of data
   delivered to the destination divided by the data offered by the
   source.  The destination values can be obtained using DataDeliveredC
   and DataDeliveredE. The source values can be obtained using
   DataOfferedC and DataOfferedE.

3.  Relation to Other MIBs

   There is no explicit relation to any other frame relay MIB nor are
   any required to implement this MIB. However, there is a need for
   knowledge of ifIndexes and some understanding of DLCIs.  The ifIndex
   information can be found in the IF-MIB which is required. The DLCI
   information can be found in either the Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC 2115)
   [20] or the Frame Relay Network Services MIB (RFC 1604) [18];
   however, neither is required.

   Upon setting of frsldPvcCtrlStatus in the frsldPvcCtrlTable to
   active(1) the system can be in one of the following three states:

   (1) The respective DLCI is known and is active. This corresponds to a
       state in which frPVCEndptRowStatus is active(1) and
       frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus is either active(2) or none(4) for the
       Frame Relay Network Services MIB (RFC 1604) [18].  For the Frame
       Relay DTE MIB, the same state is shown by frCircuitRowStatus of
       active(1) and  frCircuitState of active(2).

   (2) The respective DLCI has not been created.  This corresponds to a
       state in which the row with either frPVCEndptDLCIIndex or
       frCircuitDlci equal to the respective DLCI does not exist in
       either the frPVCEndptTable or the frCircuitTable respectively.

   (3) The respective DLCI has just been removed. This corresponds to a

Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service Level Defs MIB   February 7, 2000


       state in which either frPVCEndptRowStatus is no longer active(1)
       or frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus is no longer active(2) or none(4) for
       the Frame Relay Network Services MIB (RFC 1604) [18]. For the
       Frame Relay DTE MIB, the same state is shown when either
       frCircuitRowStatus is no longer active(1) or frCircuitState is no
       longer active(2).

   For the first case, the row in the frsldPvcDataTable will be filled.
   If frsldSmplCtrlStatus in the frsldSmplCtrlTable for the respective
   DLCI is also 'active' the frsldPvcDataSampleTable and
   frsldPvcAvailSampleTable will be filled as well.

   For the second case, the respective rows will not be added to any of
   the data or sample tables and frsldPvcCtrlStatus should be set to
   notReady(3).

   For the third case, frsldPvcCtrlDeleteOnPurge should direct the
   behavior of the system.  If all tables are purged, this case will be
   equivalent to the second case above.  Otherwise, frsldPvcCtrlStatus
   should remain active(1).


4.  Structure of the MIB

   The FRSLD-MIB consists of the following components:

       o   frsldPvcCtrlTable

       o   frsldSmplCtrlTable

       o   frsldPvcDataTable

       o   frsldPvcDataSampleTable

       o   frsldPvcAvailSampleTable

       o   frsldCapabilities

   Refer to the compliance statement defined within for a definition of
   what objects MUST be implemented.

4.1.  frsldPvcCtrlTable

   The frsldPvcCtrlTable is the central control table for operations of
   the Frame Relay Service Level Definitions MIB.  It provides variables
   to control the parameters required to calculate the objects in the
   other tables.

Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service Level Defs MIB   February 7, 2000


   A row in this table must exist in order for a row to exist in any
   other table in this MIB.

4.2.  frsldSmplCtrlTable

   This is an optional table to allow control of sampling of the data in
   the data table.

4.3.  frsldPvcDataTable

   This table contains the calculated data.  It relies on configuration
   from the control table.

4.4.  frsldPvcDataSampleTable

   This table contains samples of the delay and delivery information
   from the data table.  It relies on configuration from both the
   control table and the sample control table.

4.5.  frsldPvcAvailSampleTable

   This table contains samples of the availability information from the
   data table.  It relies on configuration from both the control table
   and the sample control table.

4.6.  frsldCapabilities

   This is a group of objects that define write capabilities of the
   read-create objects in the tables above.

Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service Level Defs MIB   February 7, 2000


8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
