      Moving Outdated TCP Extensions and TCP-related Documents to
                   Historic and Informational Status
                     draft-ietf-tcpm-undeployed-03

Abstract

   This document reclassifies several TCP extensions and TCP-related
   documents that have either been superseded, have never seen
   widespread use, or are no longer recommended for use to "Historic"
   status.  The affected RFCs are RFC 675, RFC 721, RFC 761, RFC 813,
   RFC 816, RFC 879, RFC 896, RFC 1078, and RFC 6013.  Additionally,
   this document reclassifies RFC 700, RFC 794, RFC 814, RFC 817, RFC
   872, RFC 889, RFC 964, and RFC 1071 to "Informational" status.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on April 15, 2016.

1.  Introduction

   TCP has a long history.  Over time, many RFCs have accumulated that
   describe aspects of the TCP protocol, implementation, and extensions.
   Some of these have been superseded, are no longer recommended for
   use, or have simply never seen widespread use.

   Section 6 and 7.1 of the TCP roadmap document [RFC7414] already
   reclassified a number of TCP extensions as "Historic" and describes
   the reasons for doing so, but it did not instruct the RFC Editor to
   change the status of these RFCs in the RFC database.  The purpose of
   this document is to do just that.

   In addition, this document reclassifies all other documents mentioned
   in the TCP roadmap that currently have an "Unknown" status to either
   "Historic" or "Informational".

2.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The following two sections give a short justification why a specific
   TCP extension or a TCP-related document is being reclassified as
   "Historic" or "Informational".  In addition, the letter code after an
   RFC number indicates from which original status a particular RFC is
   changed to "Historic" or "Informational" (see BCP 9 [RFC2026] for an
   explanation of these categories):

      S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or
      Internet Standard)

      E - Experimental

      I - Informational

      H - Historic

      B - Best Current Practice

      U - Unknown (not formally defined)

   For the content of the documents itself, the reader is referred
   either to the corresponding RFC or, for a brief description, to the
   TCP Roadmap document [RFC7414].

2.1.  Moving to "Historic" Status

   The RFC Editor is requested to change the status of the following
   RFCs to "Historic" [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC0675] U, "Specification of Internet Transmission Control
      Program" was replaced by the final TCP specification [RFC0793]

   o  [RFC0721] U, "Out-of-Band Control Signals in a Host-to-Host
      Protocol" was a proposal that was not incorporated into the final
      TCP specification [RFC0793]

   o  [RFC0761] U, "DoD standard Transmission Control Protocol" was
      replaced by the final TCP specification [RFC0793]

   o  [RFC0813] U, "Window and Acknowledgement Strategy in TCP" was
      incorporated into [RFC1122]

   o  [RFC0816] U, "Fault Isolation and Recovery" was incorporated into
      [RFC1122] and [RFC5461]

   o  [RFC0879] U, "The TCP Maximum Segment Size and Related Topics" was
      incorporated into [RFC1122] and [RFC6691]

   o  [RFC0896] U, "Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks" was
      incorporated into [RFC1122] and [RFC6633]

   o  [RFC1078] U, "TCP Port Service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)" should be
      deprecated, because:

      *  It modifies the TCP connection establishment semantics by also
         completing the three-way handshake when a service is not
         available.
      *  It requires all new connections to be received on a single
         port, which limits the number of connections between two
         machines.
      *  It complicates firewall implementation and management, because
         all services share the same port number.
      *  There are no known client-side deployments.

   o  [RFC6013] E: "TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT)" should be
      deprecated (although only published in 2011), because:

Internet-Draft    Outdated TCP Extensions and Documents     October 2015


      *  It uses the experimental TCP option codepoints, which prohibits
         a large-scale deployment.
      *  [RFC7413] and [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-edo] are alternatives that
         have more "rough consensus and running code" behind them.
      *  There are no known wide-scale deployments.

2.2.  Moving to "Informational" Status

   The RFC Editor is requested to change the status of the following
   RFCs to "Informational" [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC0700] U, "A Protocol Experiment", which presents a field
      report about the deployment of a very early version of TCP

   o  [RFC0794] U, "Pre-emption", which recommends that operating
      systems need to manage their limited resources, which may include
      TCP connection state

   o  [RFC0814] U, "Name, Addresses, Ports, and Routes", which gives
      guidance on designing tables and algorithms to keep track of
      various identifiers within a TCP/IP implementation

   o  [RFC0817] U, "Modularity and Efficiency in Protocol
      Implementation", which contains general implementation suggestions

   o  [RFC0872] U, "TCP-on-a-LAN", which concludes that the fear of
      using TCP on a local network is unfounded

   o  [RFC0889] U, "Internet Delay Experiments", which which describes
      experiments with the TCP retransmission timeout calculation

   o  [RFC0964] U, "Some Problems with the Specification of the Military
      Standard Transmission Control Protocol", which points out several
      specification bugs in the US Military's MIL-STD-1778 document,
      which was intended as a successor to [RFC0793]

   o  [RFC1071] U, "Computing the Internet Checksum", which lists a
      number of implementation techniques for efficiently computing the
      Internet checksum

3.  IANA Considerations

   None of the documents moved to "Historic" or "Informational" status
   have assigned TCP options numbers.  Therefore, no IANA actions are
   required.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.  Each RFC
   listed in this document attempts to address the security
   considerations of the specification it contains.
