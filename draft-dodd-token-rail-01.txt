Abstract

   This memo describes an experimental method for the transmission of
   IP datagrams over token-rail ethernet.
   This specification is primarily useful in
   Metropolitan Area Networks, but can be applied in economies of scale
   (N, HO, WIDE, O, and others).
   This is an experimental, not recommended standard.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Overview and Rationale

   Much of the rural United States, while enjoying many modern conveniences, is 
   still quite limited in the available choices for broadband internet connectivity. 
   This could be remedied by the use of an infrastructure that has existed virtually 
   untapped for its communications potential. The continued advances in DSP        
   technology, multiple frequency encoding, and general, alloy based, metallurgy
   leads to the inevitable conclusion: using encoded signals transmitted over the 
   information super railway could provide much needed relief to users in rural areas.

1. Introduction

   1.1 	Token Rail Ethernet can provide low delay, medium throughput, and low latency service.
   1.2	The connection topology is limited to point-to-point paths along a parallel bus
        topology. The packet format and header information is analogous to current token ring  
        systems.
   1.3 	Switches may be incorporated into the rail network to provide queuing and QOS, 
        at the cost of latency. Bridges are acceptable in the provisioning of connections, but 
        due to safety and conductor stability, the bridges should not be transparent in 
        Nature.
   1.4 	Standards and policies are apparently easily manageable as all carriers are 
        government subsidized.This can be misleading however as it may  cause additional
        latency and congestion of links.
   1.5 	There is limited space available to the carriers, it is allotted in continuous Right 
        of Way, across great distances. This will require better compression/decompression of  
        packet data as usage increases.
   1.6  The collision avoidance system is less than perfect but is bears no direct relation to 
        the network unless a physical rail is completely broken.
   1.7	Connection oriented service are available in some cities, usually based upon a central
        hub/turntable/switch/station topology.

2. Frame Format
   The common frame format is based on the basic ASCII character set
   with a translation table as follows :

3. Discussion
 Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized switch.
The physical implementation of connectivity to the token-rail network may 
be left to the implementer:
Some accepted examples include:
   High Analog/Low Analog, ( V!CC)
   Carrier Sense/Carrier Nonsense,
   High Tty/Low Tty
The MTU is variable, and generally increases with signal voltage
Typical MTU is not fixed but if receive window is not
well tuned to incoming streams, retransmissions will certainly occur.
Upon receipt, datagram is aurally or machine scanned
into a uuencoded message suitable for transmission an other media
(Avian Carriers and the like).
By use of a S.T.A.T.I.O.N or Single Token Asynchronous Transit Input Output Nexus, 
user datagrams may be encoded encapsulated and tokenized for transport. The R.A.I.L or
Random Access Information Link can be algorithmically or randomly assigned. The 
C.A.B.O.O.S.E or Communication Application Out of Service Endpoint, indicates the end 
of the transmission. Monitoring and traffic flow may be managed by the engineer or the 
conductor by use of proprietary, out of band management protocols. 
Authentication may be addresses by a per-session T.I.C.k.E.T or Token Identity Certificate Ensuring Trust.

4. Security Considerations
Security is not generally a problem in normal operation,
but special measures (such as data encryption) must be taken to limit
R.A.I.L. access and prevent collisions
Especially when tokens are present on the R.A.I.L.
