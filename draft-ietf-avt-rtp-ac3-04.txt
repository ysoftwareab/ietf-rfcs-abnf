Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams         May 2005


1. Introduction 

AC-3 is a high quality audio codec designed to encode multiple channels
of audio into a low bit-rate format.  AC-3 achieves its large 
compression ratios via encoding a multiplicity of channels as a single 
entity.  Dolby Digital, which is a branded version of AC-3, encodes up 
to 5.1 channels of audio.
 
AC-3 has been adopted as an audio compression scheme for many consumer 
and professional applications.  It is a mandatory audio codec for 
DVD-video, Advanced Television Standards Committee (ATSC) digital 
terrestrial television, laser disc, and Digital Living Network 
Alliance (DLNA) home networking, as well as an optional multichannel 
audio format for DVD-audio. 

There is a need to stream AC-3 data over IP networks.  Applications for
streaming AC-3 include streaming movies from a home media server to a 
display, video on demand, and multichannel Internet radio.  RTP 
provides a mechanism for stream synchronization and hence serves as 
the best transport solution for AC-3, which is a codec primarily used 
in audio-for-video applications.  

Section 2 gives a brief overview of the AC-3 algorithm.  Section 3 
specifies values for fields in the RTP header, while Section 4 
specifies the AC-3 payload format, itself.  Section 5 discusses MIME 
types and SDP usage.  Security considerations are covered in Section 6,
Congestion Control in Section 7, and IANA considerations in Section 8.
References are given in Sections 9 and 10.  

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMEDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

2. Overview of AC-3

AC-3 can deliver up to 5.1 channels of audio at data rates 
approximately equal to half of one PCM channel [ATSC-A52A], [1994AC3], 
[1996AC3].  The ".1" refers to a band-limited, optional, low-frequency 
enhancement channel.  AC-3 was designed for signals sampled at rates 
of 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz.  Data rates can vary between 64 kbps and 
640 kbps, depending the number of channels and desired quality.

AC-3 exploits psychoacoustic phenomena that cause a significant 
fraction of the information contained in a typical audio signal to be 
inaudible.  Substantial data reduction occurs via the removal of 
inaudible information contained in an audio stream.  Source coding 
techniques are further used to reduce the data rate.

Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams         May 2005


Like most perceptual coders, AC-3 operates in the frequency domain.  A 
512-point TDAC transform is taken with 50% overlap, providing 256 new 
frequency samples.  Frequency samples are then converted to exponents 
and mantissas.  Exponents are differentially encoded.  Mantissas are 
allocated a varying number of bits depending on the audibility of the 
spectral components associated with them. Audibility is determined via 
a masking curve.  Bits for mantissas are allocated from a global bit 
pool.

2.1 AC-3 Bit Stream 

AC-3 bit streams are organized into synchronization frames.  Each AC-3 
frame contains a Sync Information (SI) field, a Bit Stream 
Information (BSI) field, and 6 audio blocks (AB), each representing 
256 PCM samples for each channel.  The entire frame represents the 
time duration of 1536 PCM samples across all coded channels 
[ATSC-A52A].  AC-3 encodes audio sampled at 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 
48 kHz.  From Annex A, Part 2, of [ATSC-A52A], the time duration of 
an AC-3 frame varies with the sampling rate as follows:

      Sampling rate          Frame duration
      _____________________________________
         48   kHz                32    ms
         44.1 kHz        approx. 34.83 ms
         32   kHz                48    ms

                    Figure 1. AC-3 Frame Format

The Synchronization Information field contains information needed to 
acquire and maintain codec synchronization.  The Bit Stream 
Information field contains parameters that describe the coded audio 
service [ATSC-A52A].  Each audio block also contains fields that 
indicate the use of various coding tools: block switching, dither, 
coupling, and exponent strategy.  They also contain metadata, 
optionally used to enhance the playback, such as dynamic range control.
Figure 2 shows the structure of an AC-3 audio block.  Note that field 
sizes vary depending on the coded data.

3. RTP Header Fields 

Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is specified 
by the RTP profile under which this payload format is used, or 
signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).

Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to one to indicate that the RTP 
packet payload contains at least one complete AC-3 frame or contains 
the final fragment of an AC-3 frame. 

Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 

Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant for 
the first AC-3 frame in the RTP packet.  Packets containing fragments 
of the same frame MUST have the same time stamp.  The timestamp of the 
first RTP packet sent SHOULD be selected at random; thereafter it 
increases linearly according to the number of samples included in each 
frame (i.e. by 1576 for each frame).

4. RTP AC-3 Payload Format 

According to [RFC2736], RTP payload formats should contain an integral 
number of application data units (ADUs).  An ADU shall be equivalent 
to an AC-3 frame.  Each RTP payload MUST start with the two-byte 
payload header followed by an integral number of complete AC-3 frames, 
or a single fragment of an AC-3 frame. 

If an AC-3 frame exceeds the MTU for a network, it SHOULD be 
fragmented for transmission within an RTP packet.  Section 4.2 
provides guidelines for creating frame fragments.

4.1 Payload-Specific Header 

There is a two-octet Payload Header at the beginning of each payload.  

4.1.1 Payload Header 

Each AC-3 RTP payload MUST begin with the following payload header.  
Figure 3 shows the format of this header.

Must Be Zero (MBZ): Bits marked MBZ SHALL be set to the value zero and 
SHALL be ignored by receivers. The bits are reserved for future 
extensions.

Frame Type (FT): This two-bit field indicates the type of frame(s) 
present in the payload. It takes the following values:
          0 - One or more complete frames.
          1 - Initial fragment of frame which includes the first 
              5/8ths of the frame.  (See Section 4.2.)
          2 - Initial fragment of frame, which does not include the 
              first 5/8ths of the frame.
          3 - Fragment of frame other than initial fragment.  (Note 
              that M bit in RTP header is set for final fragment.)

Number of frames/fragments(NF): An 8-bit field whose meaning depends 
on the Frame Type (FT) in this payload. For complete frames (FT of 0), 
it is used to indicate the number of AC-3 frames in the RTP payload.  
For frame fragments (FT of 1, 2, or 3), it is used to indicate the 
number fragments (and therefore packets) that make up the current 
frame.  NF MUST be identical for packets containing fragments of the 
same frame.

4.2 Fragmentation of AC-3 Frames 

The size of an AC-3 frame depends on the sample rate of the audio and 
the data rate used by the encoder (which are indicated in the 
"Synchronization Information" header in the AC-3 frame.)  The size of 
a frame, for a given sample rate and data rate, is specified in 
Table 5.18 ("Frame Size Code Table") of [ATSC-A52A].  This table shows 
that AC-3 frames range in size from a minimum of 128 bytes to a

Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams         May 2005


maximum of 3840 bytes.  If the size of an AC-3 frame exceeds the MTU 
size, the frame SHOULD be fragmented at the RTP level.  The 
fragmentation MAY be performed at any byte boundary in the frame. RTP 
packets containing fragments of the same AC-3 frame SHALL be sent in 
consecutive order, from first to last fragment.  This enables a 
receiver to assemble the fragments in correct order.

When an AC-3 frame is fragmented, it MAY be fragmented such that at 
least the first 5/8ths of the frame data is in the first fragment.  
This provides greater resilience to packet loss.  This initial 
portion of any frame is guaranteed to contain the data necessary to 
decode the first two blocks of the frame.  Any frame fragments other 
than those containing the first 5/8ths of frame data are only 
decodable once the complete frame is received.  The 5/8ths point of 
the frame is defined in Table 7.34 ("5/8_frame Size Table") of 
[ATSC-A52A].  

5. Types and Names

5.1 Media Type Registration

Type name:                         audio

Subtype name:                      ac3

Required parameters:
        Rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate which is equal to the audio 
        sampling rate.  Permitted rates are 32000, 44100, and 48000.

        BSID: This parameter is a repetition of the Bit Stream 
        Identification (BSID) field in the AC-3 bit stream 
        [ATSC-A52A].  Its value MUST be equal to the value in the bit 
        stream.  It indicates the version number of the bit stream.  
        An AC-3 decoder is capable of decoding bit streams of a given 
        version number and all lower version numbers.  An AC-3 decoder 
        is incapable of decoding bit streams with higher version 
        number.  In the AC-3 specification, BSID is a 5-bit unsigned 
        integer, so the maximum allowed value is 31.  BSID of 8 
        corresponds to AC-3 as defined in [ATSC-A52A]. Values greater
        than 8 MUST NOT be used with this payload format.

Optional parameters:
        Channels: The number of channels present in the AC3 stream.
        This MUST be a number between 1 and 6. The LFE (".1") channel 
        MUST be counted as one channel. Note that the channel order 
        used in AC-3 differs from the channel order scheme in 
        [RFC3551].  The AC-3 channel order scheme can be found in 
        Table 5.8 of [ATSC-A52A].

        ptime: See RFC 2327 [RFC2327].  

        maxptime: See RFC 3267 [RFC3267].

The AC-3 bit stream MUST be generated according to the AC-3 
specification [ATSC-A52A].  The RTP packets MUST be packetized 
according to the RTP payload format defined in this document. 

Security considerations:                        See Section 6 of this
                                                Document.

5.2 SDP Usage 

The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a 
specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
[RFC2327], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP 
is used to specify sessions employing AC-3, the mapping is as follows:

   o   The Media type  ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o   The Media subtype  ("ac3") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" 
       as the encoding name.

   o   The required parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as the 
       clock rate, optionally followed by the parameter "channel".

   o   The required parameter "BSID" goes in SDP "a=fmtp".

   o   The optional parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP
       "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

An example of the SDP data for AC-3:
   m=audio 49111 RTP/AVP 100
   a=rtpmap:100 ac3/48000/6
   a=fmtp:100 BSID=8

Certain considerations are needed when SDP is used to perform 
offer/answer exchanges [RFC3264].  The "rate" is a symmetric parameter 
and the answer MUST use the same value or remove the payload type.

In unicast usage the "BSID" parameter is declared by each entity.  For 
recvonly or sendrecv, the parameter indicates the highest version 
number that this receiver supports. A media sender MAY use any version 
equal to or lower than that indicated.  For sendonly streams, it 
indicates the version the sender intends to use.  If the answerer 
indicates a lower version, the sender SHALL send with a version equal 
to or lower than the version indicated in the answer or renegotiate 
the session.  For multicast usage, the sender MUST use a version with 
a BSID value equal to or lower than the highest value supported by the 
answerer.

The "channels" parameter is declarative and indicates, for reconly or 
sendrecv, the desired channel configuration to receive, and for 
sendonly, the intended channel configuration to transmit.  All 
receivers are capable of receiving any of the defined channel 
configurations and the parameter exchange might be used to help 
optimize the transmission to the number of channels the receiver 
requests. "ptime" and "maxptime" are negotiated as defined for "ptime" 
in RFC 3264 [RFC3264].

6. Security Considerations 

The payload format described in this document is subject to the 
security considerations defined in RTP [RFC3550] and in any applicable 
RTP profile (e.g. [RFC3551]).  To protect the user's privacy and any 
copyrighted material, confidentiality protection would have to be 
applied.  To also protect against modification by intermediate 
entities and ensure the authenticity of the stream, integrity 
protection and authentication would be required.  Confidentiality, 
integrity protection, and authentication have to be solved by a 
mechanism external to this payload format, e.g. SRTP [RFC3711].

The AC-3 format is designed so that the validity of data frames can 
determined by decoders.  The required decoder response to a malformed 
frame is to discarded the malformed data and mute the audio output 
until a valid frame is detected and decoded.  This is expected to 
prevent crashes and other abnormal decoder behavior in response to 
errors or attacks.

7. Congestion Control

AC-3 encoders may use a range of bit rates to encode audio data, so 
it is possible to adapt network bandwidth by adjusting the encoder 
bit rate in real time or by having multiple copies of content encoded 
at different bit rates. The general congestion control considerations 
for transporting RTP data apply to AC-3 audio over RTP as well, see 
RTP [RFC3550], and any applicable RTP profile (e.g. [RFC3551]).  
Additionally, packing more frames in each RTP payload can reduce the 
number of packets sent and hence the overhead from IP/UDP/RTP headers, 
at the expense of increased delay and reduced error robustness against 
packet losses.

8. IANA Considerations

Registration of a new MIME subtype for AC-3 is requested (see 
Section 5.)
