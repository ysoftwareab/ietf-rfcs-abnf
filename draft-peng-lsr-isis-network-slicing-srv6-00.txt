1.  Introduction

   For a packet network, network slicing requires the underlying network
   to support partitioning of the network resources to provide the
   client with dedicated (private) networking, computing, and storage
   resources drawn from a shared pool.  [I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing]
   defines an unified TN-slice identifier, i.e., AII(administrative
   instance identifier) and related processing combined with Segment
   Routing technology, for the purpose of unified identification of
   topology, computing, storage resources, unified partition of L2 and
   L3 link resources, unified basis of underlay path selection within or
   between domains, and unified flow steering rule with SR policy color
   scheme.

   [I-D.zch-lsr-isis-network-slicing] describes the ISIS extensions
   required to support Packet Network Slicing over SR-MPLS dataplane.
   This document continues to describe the ISIS extensions required to

Internet-Draft        ISIS Extension for SRv6 Slice         January 2020


   support Packet Network Slicing over IPv6 dataplane, it will
   supplement on the basis of [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions].

   For SRv6 case, IPv6 address resource is directly used to represent
   SID, so that different IPv6 block could be allocated to different TN-
   slice.  There are two possible ways to advertise TN-slice specfic
   IPv6 block:

   o  Traditional prefix reachability, for default AII (0) specific IPv6
      block.

   o  New SRv6 Locator per TN-slice advertisement, for nonzero TN-slice
      specific IPv6 block.

2.  Advertising SRv6 Capabilities and Maximum SID Depths

   SRv6 capable router can advertise the SRv6 Capabilities sub-TLV and
   Maximum SRv6 SID Depths (MSD) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions].

3.  Advertising Participated TN-slice

   SRv6 capable router indicates participated TN-slice by advertising
   the TN-slice identifier Participation sub-TLV as defined in
   [I-D.zch-lsr-isis-network-slicing].

4.  TN-slice specific SRv6 SIDs and Reachability

   A node is provisioned with TN-slice specific locators for each of the
   TN-slice identified by AII participated by that node.  Each locator
   is a covering prefix for all SIDs provisioned on that node which have
   the matching AII.

   Locators MUST be advertised in the SRv6 Locator per TN-slice TLV (see
   Section 6.1).  Forwarding entries for the locators advertised in the
   SRv6 Locator per TN-slice TLV MUST be installed in the forwarding
   plane of receiving SRv6 capable routers when the associated AII is
   supported by the receiving node.

   Locators are routable and MAY also be advertised in Prefix
   Reachability TLVs (236 or 237).  But locators associated with non
   default AII SHOULD NOT be advertised in Prefix Reachability TLVs (236
   or 237).

   Locators associated with default AII (0) SHOULD be advertised in a
   Prefix Reachability TLV (236 or 237) so that legacy routers (i.e.,
   routers which do NOT support SRv6) will install a forwarding entry
   for default AII (0) SRv6 traffic.

Internet-Draft        ISIS Extension for SRv6 Slice         January 2020


   In cases where a locator advertisement is received in both in a
   Prefix Reachability TLV and an SRv6 Locator per TN-slice TLV, the
   Prefix Reachability advertisement MUST be preferred when installing
   entries in the forwarding plane.  This is to prevent inconsistent
   forwarding entries on SRv6 capable/SRv6 incapable routers.

   TN-slice specific SRv6 SIDs are advertised as sub-TLVs in the SRv6
   Locator per TN-slice TLV except for TN-slice specific SRv6 End.X
   SIDs/LAN End.X SIDs which are associated with a specific Neighbor/
   Link and are therefore advertised as sub-TLVs in TLVs 22, 23, 222,
   223, and 141.

   TN-slice specific SRv6 SIDs are not directly routable and MUST NOT be
   installed in the forwarding plane.  Reachability to TN-slice specific
   SRv6 SIDs depends upon the existence of a covering TN-slice specific
   locator.

   Adherence to the rules defined in this section will assure that TN-
   slice specific SRv6 SIDs associated with a supported AII will be
   forwarded correctly, while SRv6 SIDs associated with an unsupported
   AII will be dropped.  NOTE: The drop behavior depends on the absence
   of a default/summary route covering a given locator.

5.  Advertising Anycast Property

   The same prefix/SRv6 Locator can be advertised by multiple routers.
   See A-flag defined in [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] to
   advertise the anycast property.

6.  Advertising Locators and End SIDs for specific TN-slice

   The SRv6 Locator per TN-slice TLV is introduced to advertise SRv6
   Locators and End SIDs associated with each locator for specific TN-
   slice.

   This new TLV shares the sub-TLV space defined for TLVs 135, 235, 236
   and 237.

6.1.  SRv6 Locator per TN-slice TLV Format

   The SRv6 Locator per TN-slice TLV has the following format:

   bit set MUST NOT be leaked from level-1 to level-2.  This is to
   prevent looping.

   The remaining bits are reserved for future use.  They SHOULD be set
   to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   AII: 4 octet.  Administrative Instance Identifier, As defined in
   [I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing], represented as the TN-slice
   Identifier.

   Loc-Size: 1 octet.  Number of bits in the Locator field. (1 - 128)

   Locator: 1-16 octets.  This field encodes the advertised SRv6
   Locator.  The Locator is encoded in the minimal number of octets for
   the given number of bits.

   Sub-TLV-length: 1 octet.  Number of octets used by sub-TLVs

   Optional sub-TLVs.

6.2.  SRv6 End SID for specific TN-slice

   The SRv6 End SID sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] can be reused in this document to
   advertise TN-slice specific SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SID) with
   Endpoint behaviors.

   The SRv6 End SID sub-TLV is advertised in the SRv6 Locator per TN-
   slice TLV defined in the previous section.  SRv6 End SIDs inherit the
   AII from the parent locator.

   The SRv6 End SID MUST be a subnet of the associated Locator.  SRv6
   End SIDs which are NOT a subnet of the associated locator MUST be
   ignored.

   Multiple SRv6 End SIDs MAY be associated with the same locator.  In
   cases where the number of SRv6 End SID sub-TLVs exceeds the capacity
   of a single TLV, multiple Locator per TN-slice TLVs for the same TN-
   slice specific locator MAY be advertised.  For a given AII/Locator
   the AII value MUST be the same in all TLVs.  If this restriction is
   not met all TLVs for that AII/Locator MUST be ignored.

7.  Advertising SRv6 Adjacency SIDs for specific TN-slice

   This document defines two new sub-TLVs of TLV 22, 23, 222, 223, and
   141 - namely "SRv6 End.X SID per TN-slice" and "SRv6 LAN End.X SID
   per TN-slice".

Internet-Draft        ISIS Extension for SRv6 Slice         January 2020


   All End.X SIDs for specific TN-slice MUST be a subnet of a Locator
   with matching AII which is advertised by the same node in an SRv6
   Locator per TN-slice TLV.  End.X SIDs which do not meet this
   requirement MUST be ignored.

7.1.  SRv6 End.X SID per TN-slice sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV is used to advertise a TN-slice specific SRv6 SID
   associated with a point to point adjacency.  Multiple SRv6 End.X SID
   per TN-slice sub-TLVs MAY be associated with the same adjacency.

   The SRv6 End.X SID per TN-slice sub-TLV has the following format:

        0                   1                   2                   3

   B-Flag: Backup flag.  If set, the End.X SID is eligible for
   protection (e.g., using IPFRR) as described in [RFC8355].

   S-Flag.  Set flag.  When set, the S-Flag indicates that the End.X SID
   refers to a set of adjacencies (and therefore MAY be assigned to
   other adjacencies as well).

   P-Flag.  Persistent flag.  When set, the P-Flag indicates that the
   End.X SID is persistently allocated, i.e., the End.X SID value
   remains consistent across router restart and/or interface flap.

   Other bits: MUST be zero when originated and ignored when received.

   Weight: 1 octet.  The value represents the weight of the End.X SID
   for the purpose of load balancing.  The use of the weight is defined
   in [RFC8402].

   AII: 4 octet.  Administrative Instance Identifier, As defined in
   [I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing], represented as TN-slice Identifier.

   Endpoint Behavior: 2 octets.  As defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].  Legal behavior values
   for this sub-TLV are defined in Section 8.

   SID: 16 octets.  This field encodes the advertised SRv6 SID.

   Sub-sub-TLV-length: 1 octet.  Number of octets used by sub-sub-TLVs

   Note that multiple TLVs for the same neighbor may be required in
   order to advertise all of the SRv6 End.X SIDs associated with that
   neighbor.

7.2.  SRv6 LAN End.X SID per TN-slice sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV is used to advertise a TN-slice specific SRv6 SID
   associated with a LAN adjacency.  Since the parent TLV is advertising
   an adjacency to the Designated Intermediate System(DIS) for the LAN,
   it is necessary to include the System ID of the physical neighbor on
   the LAN with which the SRv6 SID is associated.  Given that a large
   number of neighbors may exist on a given LAN a large number of SRv6
   LAN END.X SID per TN-slice sub-TLVs may be associated with the same
   LAN.  Note that multiple TLVs for the same DIS neighbor may be
   required in order to advertise all of the TN-slice specific SRv6
   End.X SIDs associated with that neighbor.

   The SRv6 LAN End.X SID per TN-slice sub-TLV has the following format:

   Endpoint Behavior: 2 octets.  As defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].  Legal behavior values
   for this sub-TLV are defined in Section 8.

   SID: 16 octets.  This field encodes the advertised SRv6 SID.

   Sub-sub-TLV-length: 1 octet.  Number of octets used by sub-sub-TLVs.

8.  SRv6 SID Structure Indication

   The SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] can be reused in this document to
   indicate the SRv6 SID Structure information.  The SRv6 SID Structure
   Sub-Sub-TLV could be an optional Sub-Sub-TLV of:

   SRv6 End SID Sub-TLV (Section 6.2)

   SRv6 End.X SID per TN-slice Sub-TLV (Section 7.1)

   SRv6 LAN End.X SID per TN-slice Sub-TLV (Section 7.2)

9.  Advertising Endpoint Behaviors

   The Endpoint behaviors and their codepoints, which MAY be advertised
   by IS-IS and the SID sub-TLVs in which each type MAY Appear, are
   consistent with that in [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions].

10.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in [ISO10589], [RFC5304],
   and [RFC5310].

11.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

12.  IANA Considerations
