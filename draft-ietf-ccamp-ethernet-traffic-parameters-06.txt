     Abstract 
         
        This document describes the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) - specific 
        Ethernet Traffic Parameters as described in MEF10.1 when using 
        Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Resource 
        ReSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling.

     Internet-Draft       Ethernet Traffic Parameters       October 31, 2008 
         

     1. Introduction 
         
        Per [RFC3471], GMPLS allows the inclusion of technology specific 
        parameters in signaling. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC specific 
        objects are introduced in this document that describe Metro Ethernet 
        Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic parameters as specified in [MEF10.1]. 
         
        These traffic parameters MUST be used when the L2SC value is 
        specified in the LSP Switching Type field of a Generalized Label 
        Request (see [RFC3471]) and the LSP encoding type is Ethernet. For 
        example: 
         
        o For Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services [MEF6], these traffic    
          parameters are applicable non-discriminately to all EVCs crossing a  
          given port. 
         
        o For Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services [MEF6], these    
          traffic parameters are applicable per Ethernet Virtual Connection  
          (EVC) with single or multiple Class of Service (CoS), independent  
          of its associated (set of) VLAN ID (VID). 
         
          Association between EVC and VIDs is detailed in [MEF10.1]. The    
          format and encoding of the (set of) VIDs is documented in a  
          companion document [GMPLS-ESVCS].  
         
        This does not prevent broader usage for Ethernet LSP of the traffic 
        parameters specified in this document. 
         
     2. Conventions used in this document 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 
         
        Moreover, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology 
        [MEF10.1] as well as [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. 
         
     3. Overview 
         
       The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link 
       type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP, and the MTU value 
       for the LSP. 
        
       The Bandwidth Profile defines the set of traffic parameters 
       applicable to a sequence of Service Frames, referred to as bandwidth 
       profile parameters:

       o Committed Rate: indicates the rate at which traffic commits to be  
         sent to the Ethernet LSP. The Committed Rate is described in terms 
         of the CIR (Committed Information Rate) and CBS (Committed Burst  
         Size) traffic parameters. 
        
         o CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time) up  
           to which the network is committed to transfer frames and meets  
           its performance objectives. 
        
         o CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units  
           (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the  
           interface speed to remain CIR-conformant. 
        
       o Excess Rate: indicates the extent by which the traffic sent on an 
         Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate. The Excess Rate is 
         described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS  
         (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
        
         o EIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time), 
           in excess of the CIR, up to which the network may transfer frames    
           without any performance objectives. 
        
         o EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information unit 
           (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the  
           interface speed to remain EIR-conformant. 
        
       o Color mode (CM): indicates whether the "color-aware" or "color-    
         blind" property is employed by the bandwidth profile. 
        
       o Coupling flag (CF): allows the choice between two modes of  
         operations of the rate enforcement algorithm. 
         
     4. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC Object 
      
        The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by

        Profile: 8 bits (this field is to be registered by IANA) 
         
           This field is defined as a vector of binary flags. The following  
           flags are defined: 
               
              Flag 1 (bit 0): coupling flag (CF) 
              Flag 2 (bit 1): color mode (CM) 
         
           Where bit 0 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved, they 
           SHOULD be set to zero when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when  
           received. 
               
           A flag is set to value 1 to indicate that the corresponding    
           metering is requested. 
         
           The Flag 1 allows the choice between two modes of operations of 
           the rate enforcement algorithm. 
         
           The Flag 2 indicates whether the color-aware or color-blind 
           property is employed by the bandwidth profile. When Flag 2 is      
           set to value 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm is said to  
           be in color blind (color aware) mode. 
      
        Index: 8 bits 
      
           The index field is used to reference bandwidth allocated for a 
           given traffic class in case a multiple-class LSP is being 
           requested. The index field value MUST correspond to at least one 
           of the index value included in the extended ClassType object ([DS- 
           TE], [MCOS]). 
      
           A given index value j can be associated to at most N Class-Type 
           values CTi (i =< N) of the extended Class-Type object. This 
           applies in case a set of one or more CTi maps a single (shared) BW  
           profile. An example of value setting consists then in assigning 
           an arbitrary value (comprised within the range [0x08,0xF8],  
           defined by the 5 MSB of the Index field) associated to a set of  
           CTi. This allows mapping to one of 248 pre-defined CTi sets. 
      
           A given index value j can be associated to a single CTi (1:1  
           correspondence). In this case, the index value setting consists  
           then in assigning the 3 LSB of the index field itself to the CTi  
           value itself (comprised in the range [0x00,0x07]). This applies in  
           case a single CTi maps a single (dedicated) BW profile or multiple  
           (dedicated) BW profiles. In the former case (single BW profile),  
           the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object includes a single Ethernet  
           Bandwidth Profile TLV. In the second case, the Ethernet

           SENDER_TSPEC includes a set of more than one Ethernet Bandwidth  
           Profile TLVs (whose respective Index value is associated to a  
           single CTi value).     
      
           Note that the current specification allow for combining shared and 
           dedicated BW profiles to the same LSP. That is, an Ethernet      
           SENDER_TSPEC object MAY include multiple Ethernet Bandwidth  
           Profile TLVs whose respective index can be associated on a 1:1  
           basis to a single CTi or to a set of multiple CTi. 
         
           For each subobject of the extended Class-Type object [MCOS]: 
              o Each CTi value SHOULD correspond 1:1 to MEF CE VLAN-CoS 
              o The BW requested per CTi field MAY be used for bandwidth 
                accounting purposes. 
              
           By default, the value of the Index field MUST be set to 0. 
         
        Reserved: 16 bits 
         
           These bits SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored 
           when received. 
         
        CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits 
         
           The value of the CIR is in units of bytes per second. The CIR is 
           encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
           (see [RFC4506]). 
         
           The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
         
        CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits 
         
           The value of the CBS is in units of bytes. The CBS is encoded 
           as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
           [RFC4506]). 
         
           When CIR is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be 
           greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
         
        EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits 
         
           The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second. The EIR 
           is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point 
           number (see [RFC4506]). 
         
           The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.

        EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits 
         
           The value of the EBS is in units of bytes. The EBS is encoded 
           as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
           [RFC4506]). 
         
           When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the EBS MUST be 
           greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
         
     5. Ethernet FLOWSPEC Object 
         
        The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by 
        IANA, with recommended value 6) has the same format as the Ethernet 
        SENDER_TSPEC object. 
         
     6. Ethernet ADSPEC Object 
         
        There is no ADSPEC object associated with the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC 
        object. 
         
        Either the ADSPEC object is omitted or an IntServ ADSPEC with the 
        Default General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service 
        fragment is used, see [RFC2210]. 
         
     7. Processing 
         
        The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object carries the traffic specification 
        generated by the RSVP session sender. The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC 
        object SHOULD be forwarded and delivered unchanged to both 
        intermediate and egress nodes. 
         
        The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object carries reservation request information 
        generated by receivers. As with any FLOWSPEC object, Ethernet 
        FLOWSPEC object flows upstream toward the ingress node. 
         
        Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself and 
        the interfaces on which the LSP will be established can support the 
        requested Switching Granularity, MTU and values included in sub-
        object TLVs. If the requested value(s) can not be supported, the 
        receiver node MUST generate a PathErr message with the error code 
        "Traffic Control Error" and the error value "Service unsupported" 
        (see [RFC2205]). 
         
        In addition, if the MTU field is received with a value smaller than 
        the minimum transfer unit size of the Ethernet frame (e.g. 46 bytes 
        for Ethernet v2, 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3), the node MUST generate a

        PathErr message with the error code "Traffic Control Error" and the 
        error value "Bad Tspec value" (see [RFC2205]). 
         
        Error processing of the Extended Class-Type object follows rules 
        defined in [MCOS]. Moreover, an LSR receiving a Path message with the 
        Extended Class-Type object, which recognizes the object and the 
        particular Class-Type but does detect a mismatch in the index values, 
        MUST send a PathErr message towards the sender with the error code 
        "Extended Class-Type Error" and the error value "Class-Type mismatch" 
        (see [RFC2205]). 
         
     8. Security Considerations 
         
        This document introduces no new security considerations to either 
        [RFC3473]. 
         
        GMPLS security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers to 
        [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE. Further details of MPLS-TE and GMPLS security 
        can be found in [MPLS-SEC]. 
         
     9. IANA Considerations 
         
        IANA maintain registries and sub-registries for RSVP-TE as used by 
        GMPLS. IANA is requested to make allocations from these registries as 
        set out in the following sections. 
         
     9.1. RSVP Objects Class Types 

        This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP 
        objects. IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Resource 
        ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class 
        Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry.

     9.2. Ethernet Switching Granularities 

        IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called "Generalized 
        Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters". IANA is 
        requested to create a new sub-registry called "Ethernet Switching 
        Granularities" to contain the values that may be carried in the 
        Switching Granularity field of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 
         
        Values shall be assigned as follows:
