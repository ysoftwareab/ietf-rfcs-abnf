      It is significant that having the creator of a bounce be able to
      make this assessment, means that all of earlier intermediary MTAs
      also can.  Hence, every MTA would be able to assess whether a
      message has an unauthorized RFC2821.MailFrom.

      Unfortunately, public key services have not yet gained wide
      adoption and there are multiple mechanisms already in service.
      Therefore, this specification is not able to provide a single
      method for public MailFrom validity checking.

local-part       = tag-type "=" tag-val "=" loc-core

tag-type         = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" )
                            ; specific, registered validation scheme
                            ; see <IANA Considerations> section

loc-core         = {original local-part value}

tag-val          = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" )
                            ; the validation data


tag-type       = "prvs"
                           ; simple private signature

tag-val        =  K DDD SSSSSS

K              =  1DIGIT
                           ; key number, to allow key rotation

DDD            =  3DIGIT
                           ; day number, low three digits of
                           ; the number of days since 1970
                           ; when the address will expire

SSSSSS         =  6HEXDIG
                           ; hex of the first three bytes of the
                           ; SHA-1 HMAC of <hash-source> and a key

hash-source    =  K DDD <orig-mailfrom>

orig-mailfrom  =  {original RFC2821.MailFrom address}
