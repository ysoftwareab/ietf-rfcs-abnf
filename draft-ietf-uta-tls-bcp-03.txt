             Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS and DTLS
                       draft-ietf-uta-tls-bcp-03

Abstract

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Security Layer
   (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application
   protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the
   last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged,
   including attacks on its most commonly used cipher suites and modes
   of operation.  This document provides recommendations for improving
   the security of both software implementations and deployed services
   that use TLS and DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Security Layer
   (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application
   protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the
   last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged,
   including attacks on its most commonly used cipher suites and modes
   of operation.  For instance, both AES-CBC and RC4, which together
   comprise most current usage, have been attacked in the context of
   TLS.  A companion document [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-attacks] provides
   detailed information about these attacks.

   Because of these attacks, those who implement and deploy TLS and DTLS
   need updated guidance on how TLS can be used securely.  Note that
   this document provides guidance for deployed services, as well as
   software implementations.  In fact, this document calls for the
   deployment of algorithms that are widely implemented but not yet
   widely deployed.  Concerning deployment, this document targets a wide
   audience, namely all deployers who wish to add authentication,
   confidentiality and data integrity to their communications.  This
   document does not address the rare deployment scenarios where one of
   these three properties is not desired.

   The recommendations herein take into consideration the security of
   various mechanisms, their technical maturity and interoperability,
   and their prevalence in implementations at the time of writing.
   Unless noted otherwise, these recommendations apply to both TLS and
   DTLS.  TLS 1.3, when it is standardized and deployed in the field,
   should resolve the current vulnerabilities while providing
   significantly better functionality, and will very likely obsolete
   this document.

   These are minimum recommendations for the use of TLS for the
   specified audience.  Individual specifications may have stricter
   requirements related to one or more aspects of the protocol, based on
   their particular circumstances.  When that is the case, implementers
   MUST adhere to those stricter requirements.

   Community knowledge about the strength of various algorithms and
   feasible attacks can change quickly, and experience shows that a
   security BCP is a point-in-time statement.  Readers are advised to
   seek out any errata or updates that apply to this document.

2.  Intended Audience

   In the following, we specify which audience this document addresses
   concerning deployment.  Most deployers are very likely part of this
   audience, but very specialized use cases of TLS that are outside of
   the intended audience can exist.

2.1.  Security Services

   This document provides recommendations for an audience that wishes to
   secure their communication with TLS to achieve the following:

   o  Authentication: this means that an end-point of the TLS
      communication is authenticated as the intended entity to
      communicate with.  TLS allows to authenticate one or both end-
      points in the communication.

   o  Confidentiality: all (payload) communication is encrypted with the
      goal that no party should be able to decrypt it except the
      intended receiver.

   o  Data integrity: any changes made to the communication are
      detectable by the receiver.

   Deployers MUST verify that they do not need one of these three
   properties if they deviate from the recommendations given in this
   document.

2.2.  Examples

   The intended audience covers those services that are most commonly
   used on the Internet, among many others:

   o  Operators of WWW servers (HTTPS).

   o  Operators of email servers (SMTPS, IMAPS, POPS).

   o  Operators of instant-messaging services (XMPPS, IRCS).

3.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  General Recommendations

   This section provides general recommendations on the secure use of
   TLS.  Recommendations related to cipher suites are discussed in the
   following section.

4.1.  Protocol Versions

   It is important both to stop using old, less secure versions of SSL/
   TLS and to start using modern, more secure versions.  Therefore:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate SSL version 2.

      Rationale: SSLv2 is considered today as insecure [RFC6176].

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate SSL version 3.

      Rationale: SSLv3 [RFC6101] was an improvement over SSLv2 and
      plugged some significant security holes, but did not support
      strong cipher suites.  In addition, SSLv3 does not support TLS
      extensions, some of which are considered security-critical today.

   o  Implementations SHOULD NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246].

      Rationale: TLS 1.0 (published in 1999) does not support many
      modern, strong cipher suites.

   o  Implementations MAY negotiate TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346].

      Rationale: TLS 1.1 (published in 2006) is a security improvement
      over TLS 1.0, but still does not support certain stronger cipher
      suites.

   o  Implementations MUST support, and prefer to negotiate, TLS version
      1.2 [RFC5246].

      Rationale: Several stronger cipher suites are available only with
      TLS 1.2 (published in 2008).

   This BCP applies to TLS 1.2.  It is not safe for readers to assume
   that the recommendations in this BCP apply to any future version of
   TLS.

4.2.  Applicability to DTLS

   DTLS [RFC4347] [RFC6347] is an adaptation of TLS for UDP datagrams.





Sheffer, et al.          Expires March 25, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


   With respect to the recommendations in the current document, DTLS 1.0
   is equivalent to TLS 1.1.  The only exception is RC4 which is
   disallowed in DTLS.  DTLS 1.2 is equivalent to TLS 1.2.

4.3.  Fallback to SSL

   Some client implementations revert to lower versions of TLS or even
   to SSLv3 if the server rejected higher versions of the protocol.
   This fall back can be forced by a man in the middle (MITM) attacker.
   By default, such clients MUST NOT fall back to SSLv3.

   Rationale: TLS 1.0 and SSLv3 are significantly less secure than TLS
   1.2, the version recommended by this document.  While TLS 1.0-only
   servers are still quite common, IP scans show that SSLv3-only servers
   amount to only about 3% of the current Web server population.

4.4.  Strict TLS

   Combining unprotected and TLS-protected communication opens the way
   to SSL Stripping and similar attacks.  Therefore:

   o  In cases where an application protocol allows implementations or
      deployments a choice between strict TLS configuration and dynamic
      upgrade from unencrypted to TLS-protected traffic (such as
      STARTTLS), clients and servers SHOULD prefer strict TLS
      configuration.

   o  Client and server implementations MUST support the HTTP Strict
      Transport Security (HSTS) header [RFC6797], in order to allow Web
      servers to advertise that they are willing to accept TLS-only
      clients.

   o  When applicable, Web servers SHOULD use HSTS to indicate that they
      are willing to accept TLS-only clients.

4.5.  Compression

   Implementations and deployments SHOULD disable TLS-level compression
   ([RFC5246], Sec. 6.2.2), because it has been subject to security
   attacks.

   Implementers should note that compression at higher protocol levels
   can allow an active attacker to extract cleartext information from
   the connection.  The BREACH attack is one such case.  These issues
   can only be mitigated outside of TLS and are thus out of scope of the
   current document.  See Sec. 2.5 of [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-attacks] for
   further details.

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


4.6.  TLS Session Resumption

   If TLS session resumption is used, care ought to be taken to do so
   safely.  In particular, when using session tickets [RFC5077], the
   resumption information MUST be authenticated and encrypted to prevent
   modification or eavesdropping by an attacker.  Further
   recommendations apply to session tickets:

   o  A strong cipher suite MUST be used when encrypting the ticket (as
      least as strong as the main TLS cipher suite).

   o  Ticket keys MUST be changed regularly, e.g. once every week, so as
      not to negate the benefits of forward secrecy (see Section 7.3 for
      details on forward secrecy).

   o  Session ticket validity SHOULD be limited to a reasonable duration
      (e.g. 1 day), for similar reasons.

4.7.  TLS Renegotiation

   Where handshake renegotiation is implemented, both clients and
   servers MUST implement the renegotiation_info extension, as defined
   in [RFC5746].

   To counter the Triple Handshake attack, we adopt the recommendation
   from [triple-handshake]: TLS clients SHOULD ensure that all
   certificates received over a connection are valid for the current
   server endpoint, and abort the handshake if they are not.  In some
   usages, it may be simplest to refuse any change of certificates
   during renegotiation.

4.8.  Server Name Indication

   TLS implementations MUST support the Server Name Indication (SNI)
   extension for those higher level protocols which would benefit from
   it, including HTTPS.  However, unlike implementation, the use of SNI
   in particular circumstances is a matter of local policy.

5.  Recommendations: Cipher Suites

   TLS and its implementations provide considerable flexibility in the
   selection of cipher suites.  Unfortunately many available cipher
   suites are insecure, and so misconfiguration can easily result in
   reduced security.  This section includes recommendations on the
   selection and negotiation of cipher suites.

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


5.1.  General Guidelines

   It is important both to stop using old, insecure cipher suites and to
   start using modern, more secure cipher suites.  Therefore:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate the NULL cipher suites.

      Rationale: The NULL cipher suites offer no encryption whatsoever
      and thus are completely insecure.

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate RC4 cipher suites

      Rationale: The RC4 stream cipher has a variety of cryptographic
      weaknesses, as documented in [I-D.ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4].

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate cipher suites offering only so-
      called "export-level" encryption (including algorithms with 40
      bits or 56 bits of security).

      Rationale: These cipher suites are deliberately "dumbed down" and
      are very easy to break.

   o  Applications MUST NOT negotiate cipher suites of less than 112
      bits of security.

   o  Implementations SHOULD NOT negotiate cipher suites that use
      algorithms offering less than 128 bits of security.  Note that
      some legacy cipher suites (e.g. 168-bit 3DES) have an effective
      key length which is smaller than their nominal key length (112
      bits in the case of 3DES).  Such cipher suites should be evaluated
      according to their effective key length.

      Rationale: Although these cipher suites are not actively subject
      to breakage, their useful lifespan is short enough that stronger
      cipher suites are desirable. 128-bit ciphers are expected to
      remain secure for at least several years, and 256-bit ciphers
      "until the next fundamental technology breakthrough".

   o  Implementations MUST support, and SHOULD prefer to negotiate,
      cipher suites offering forward secrecy, such as those in the
      Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie
      Hellman ("DHE" and "ECDHE") families.

      Rationale: Forward secrecy (sometimes called "perfect forward
      secrecy") prevents the recovery of information that was encrypted
      with older session keys, thus limiting the amount of time during
      which attacks can be successful.

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


5.2.  Recommended Cipher Suites

   Given the foregoing considerations, implementation of the following
   cipher suites is RECOMMENDED:

   o  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

   o  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

   o  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

   o  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

   We suggest that TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 be preferred in
   general.  See [RFC5289] for additional implementation details.

   It is noted that those cipher suites are supported only in TLS 1.2
   since they are authenticated encryption (AEAD) algorithms [RFC5116].

   [RFC4492] allows clients and servers to negotiate ECDH parameters
   (curves).  Both clients and servers SHOULD include the "Supported
   Elliptic Curves" extension [RFC4492].  For interoperability, clients
   and servers SHOULD support the NIST P-256 (secp256r1) curve
   [RFC4492].  In addition, clients SHOULD send an ec_point_formats
   extension with a single element, "uncompressed".

5.3.  Cipher Suite Negotiation Details

   Clients SHOULD include TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 as the
   first proposal to any server, unless they have prior knowledge that
   the server cannot respond to a TLS 1.2 client_hello message.

   Servers SHOULD prefer this cipher suite whenever it is proposed, even
   if it is not the first proposal.

   Clients are of course free to offer stronger cipher suites, e.g.
   using AES-256; when they do, the server SHOULD prefer the stronger
   cipher suite unless there are compelling reasons (e.g., seriously
   degraded performance) to choose otherwise.

   Note that other profiles of TLS 1.2 exist that use different cipher
   suites.  For example, [RFC6460] defines a profile that uses the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suites.

   This document is not an application profile standard, in the sense of
   Sec. 9 of [RFC5246].  As a result, clients and servers are still

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


   REQUIRED to support the mandatory TLS cipher suite,
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.

5.4.  Public Key Length

   With a key exchange based on modular Diffie-Hellman ("DHE" cipher
   suites), key lengths of at least 2048 bits are RECOMMENDED.

   Rationale: because Diffie-Hellman keys of 1024 bits are estimated to
   be roughly equivalent to 80-bit symmetric keys, it is better to use
   longer keys for the "DHE" family of cipher suites.  Unfortunately,
   some existing software cannot handle (or cannot easily handle) key
   lengths greater than 1024 bits.  The most common workaround for these
   systems is to prefer the "ECDHE" family of cipher suites instead of
   the "DHE" family.  For modular groups, key lengths of at least 2048
   bits are estimated to be roughly equivalent to 112-bit symmetric keys
   and might be sufficient for at least the next 10 years.

   Servers SHOULD authenticate using 2048-bit certificates.  In
   addition, the use of SHA-256 fingerprints is RECOMMENDED (see
   [CAB-Baseline] for more details).  Clients SHOULD indicate to servers
   that they request SHA-256, by using the "Signature Algorithms"
   extension defined in TLS 1.2.

5.5.  Modular vs. Elliptic Curve DH Cipher Suites

   Not all TLS implementations support both modular and EC Diffie-
   Hellman groups, as required by Section 5.2.  Some implementations are
   severely limited in the length of DH values.  When such
   implementations need to be accommodated, we recommend using (in
   priority order):

   1.  Elliptic Curve DHE with negotiated parameters [RFC5289]

   2.  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 [RFC5288], with 2048-bit
       Diffie-Hellman parameters

   3.  The same cipher suite, with 1024-bit parameters.

   Rationale: Elliptic Curve Cryptography is not universally deployed
   for several reasons, including its complexity compared to modular
   arithmetic and longstanding IPR concerns.  On the other hand, there
   are two related issues hindering effective use of modular Diffie-
   Hellman cipher suites in TLS:

   o  There are no protocol mechanisms to negotiate the DH groups or
      parameter lengths supported by client and server.

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


   o  There are widely deployed client implementations that reject
      received DH parameters if they are longer than 1024 bits.

   We note that with DHE and ECDHE cipher suites, the TLS master key
   only depends on the Diffie Hellman parameters and not on the strength
   of the RSA certificate; moreover, 1024 bit modular DH parameters are
   generally considered insufficient at this time.

   With modular ephemeral DH, deployers SHOULD carefully evaluate
   interoperability vs. security considerations when configuring their
   TLS endpoints.

5.6.  Truncated HMAC

   The truncated HMAC extension, defined in Sec. 7 of [RFC6066] does not
   apply to the AEAD cipher suites recommended above.  However it does
   apply to most other TLS cipher suites.  Its use has been shown to be
   insecure in [PatersonRS11], and implementations MUST NOT use it.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no actions of IANA.  [Note to RFC Editor:
   please remove this whole section before publication.]

7.  Security Considerations

   This entire document discusses the security practices directly
   affecting applications using the TLS protocol.  This section contains
   broader security considerations related to technologies used in
   conjunction with or by TLS.

7.1.  Host Name Validation

   Application authors should take note that TLS implementations
   frequently do not validate host names, and must therefore determine
   if the TLS implementation they are using does, and if not write their
   own validation code or consider changing the TLS implementation.

   It is noted that the requirements regarding host name validation (and
   in general, binding between the TLS layer and the protocol that runs
   above it) vary between different protocols.  For HTTPS, these
   requirements are defined by Sec. 3 of [RFC2818].

   Readers are referred to [RFC6125] for further details regarding
   generic host name validation in the TLS context.  In addition, the
   RFC contains a long list of example protocols, some of which
   implement a policy very different from HTTPS.

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


   With some protocols, the host name is obtained indirectly and in an
   insecure manner, e.g.  by an insecure DNS query for an MX record.  In
   these cases, the host name SHOULD NOT be used as a trusted identity
   even when it matches the presented certificate.

7.2.  AES-GCM

   Sec. Section 5.2 above recommends the use of the AES-GCM
   authenticated encryption algorithm.  Please refer to [RFC5246], Sec.
   11 for general security considerations when using TLS 1.2, and to
   [RFC5288], Sec. 6 for security considerations that apply specifically
   to AES-GCM when used with TLS.

7.3.  Forward Secrecy

   Forward secrecy (also often called Perfect Forward Secrecy or "PFS",
   and defined in [RFC4949]) is a defense against an attacker who
   records encrypted conversations where the session keys are only
   encrypted with the communicating parties' long-term keys.  Should the
   attacker be able to obtain these long-term keys at some point later
   in time, he will be able to decrypt the session keys and thus the
   entire conversation.  In the context of TLS and DTLS, such compromise
   of long-term keys is not entirely implausible.  It can happen, for
   example, due to:

   o  A client or server being attacked by some other attack vector, and
      the private key retrieved.

   o  A long-term key retrieved from a device that has been sold or
      otherwise decommissioned without prior wiping.

   o  A long-term key used on a device as a default key [Heninger2012].

   o  A key generated by a Trusted Third Party like a CA, and later
      retrieved from it either by extortion or compromise
      [Soghoian2011].

   o  A cryptographic break-through, or the use of asymmetric keys with
      insufficient length [Kleinjung2010].

   PFS ensures in such cases that the session keys cannot be determined
   even by an attacker who obtains the long-term keys some time after
   the conversation.  It also protects against an attacker who is in
   possession of the long-term keys, but remains passive during the
   conversation.

   PFS is generally achieved by using the Diffie-Hellman scheme to
   derive session keys.  The Diffie-Hellman scheme has both parties

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


   maintain private secrets and send parameters over the network as
   modular powers over certain cyclic groups.  The properties of the so-
   called Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) allow to derive the session
   keys without an eavesdropper being able to do so.  There is currently
   no known attack against DLP if sufficiently large parameters are
   chosen.  A variant of the Diffie-Hellman scheme uses Elliptic Curves
   instead of the originally proposed modular arithmetics.

   Unfortunately, many TLS/DTLS cipher suites were defined that do not
   feature PFS, e.g.  TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256.  We thus advocate
   strict use of PFS-only ciphers.

7.4.  Diffie Hellman Exponent Reuse

   For performance reasons, many TLS implementations reuse Diffie-
   Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exponents across multiple
   connections.  Such reuse can result in major security issues:

   o  If exponents are reused for a long time (e.g., more than a few
      hours), an attacker who gains access to the host can decrypt
      previous connections.  In other words, exponent reuse negates the
      effects of forward secrecy.

   o  TLS implementations that reuse exponents should test the DH public
      key they receive, in order to avoid some known attacks.  These
      tests are not standardized in TLS at the time of writing.  See
      [RFC6989] for recipient tests required of IKEv2 implementations
      that reuse DH exponents.

7.5.  Certificate Revocation

   Unfortunately there is currently no effective, Internet-scale
   mechanism to affect certificate revocation:

   o  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are non-scalable and therefore
      rarely used.

   o  The On-Line Certification Status Protocol (OCSP) presents both
      scaling and privacy issues when used for heavy traffic Web
      servers.  In addition, clients typically "soft-fail", meaning they
      do not abort the TLS connection if the OCSP server does not
      respond.

   o  OCSP stapling (Sec. 8 of [RFC6066]) resolves the operational
      issues with OCSP, but is still ineffective in the presence of a
      MITM attacker because they can simply ignore the client's request
      for a stapled OCSP response.

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2014


   o  OCSP stapling as defined in [RFC6066] does not extend to
      intermediate certificates used in a certificate chain.  [RFC6961]
      addresses this shortcoming, but is a recent addition without much
      deployment.

   o  Proprietary mechanisms that embed revocation lists in the Web
      browser's configuration database cannot scale beyond a small
      number of the most heavily used Web servers.

   The current consensus appears to be that OCSP stapling, combined with
   a "must staple" mechanism similar to HSTS, would finally resolve this
   problem; in particular when used together with the extension defined
   in [RFC6961].  But such a mechanism has not been standardized yet.
