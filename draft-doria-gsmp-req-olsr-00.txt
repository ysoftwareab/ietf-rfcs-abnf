1.  Overview

   This draft is intended to open up discussion of the required
   changes to GSMP for support of optical (WDM or DWDM) switching of
   IP packets and flows. It is uncertain at this point what the mix
   of implementations will be, but the possibilities include: IP
   based optical routers, optical label switches, wavelength routers,
   and optical crossconnects.  There are also several different
   generic models that might be applied to running IP over WDM.[7]
   One item which seems probable, however, is that it will be
   advantageous to separate the control plane functions from the data
   plane functions in order to provide a more flexible network
   architecture.[4]

   In this draft, no position will be taken about the eventual
   architectural model which will be most appropriate for IP over
   WDM. The only assumption is that the ability to separate the
   control plane from the data plane is as useful in IP over WDM as
   it is in current MPLS technology.

   GSMP[3] is well suited for providing the optical switch control
   mechanism necessary for allowing an IP based controller to direct
   the activities of an optical switch. In order for GSMP to operate
   between IP controllers and optical switches and cross connects,
   support for optical labels and service and resource abstractions
   must be added to GSMP.


2.  Connection Management Issues

   The current connection management commands shouldn't need to be
   changed to support optical switches. There will, however, need to
   be new label types defined.  Optical labels are too long to use
   the GSMP short labels, and will therefore require that a new set
   of TLVs be created.  There are two options for this that are
   explored below.

2.1  Single Optical Label TLV

   An "optical" label TLV is needed in order to encode optical
   labels. However a label in an MPLS enabled optical network may
   represent any of the following:

       A fiber bundle
       An arbitrary number of fibers in that bundle
       A single fiber
       An arbitrary number of lambdas within a fiber
       A single fiber

Internet Draft     Requirements for OLSR support      Jan 2000

       An arbitrary number of sub-lambda channels
       A single sub-lambda channel

   One way to support these assumptions/requirements in GSMP would be
   to provide a single (but complicated) optical label TLV which
   would accommodate all the ways of expressing a label. A general
   format would be as follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |T|S|x|x| Optical Label (0x3xx) |          Label Length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Label Component 1                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ~                              ...                              ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Label Component N                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Each of the label components would encode the variants of channel
   group types such as Fiber, Lambda, Gigabit Ethernet, SONET (with
   line rate specified) etc.

      T: Label Type Indicator
         T = 0: Short 28 bit Label
         T = 1: TLV label

         Both label types are discussed below in [3] (section
         3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2).

      S: Stacked Label Indicator
         Label Stacking is discussed in [3] (section 3.1.3.3)

      X: Reserved Flags. These are generally used by specific
         messages and will be defined in those messages.

2.2  Separate Variant Labels

   Or as an alternative we could use one label tlv for each variant
   as follows:

2.2.1  Fiber Label TLV


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |T|S|x|x|   Fiber Label (0x3xx) |          Label Length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           Fiber ID            |            Lambda ID          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ~                              ...                              ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           Fiber ID            |            Lambda ID          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   If the group type is fiber, the all lambda id fields should be
   0x0000 or 0xffff as other have suggested. An alternative could be
   to use the Lambda Label TLV specified below for expressing a fiber
   label with the Lambda ID set as proposed above.


2.2.2  Lambda Label TLV


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |T|S|x|x|  Lambda Label (0x3xx) |          Label Length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           Fiber ID            |            Lambda ID          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ~                              ...                              ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           Fiber ID            |            Lambda ID          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   An optical label may be composed of fiber id's and lambdas. The
   Fiber ID identifies the physical fiber(s) and the Lambda ID
   identifies the individual Lambda(s). This label tlv could describe
   what lambdas to use in one or several fibers.

2.2.3  SONET/SDH Label TLV

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |T|S|x|x|SDH/SONET Label (0x3xx)|          Label Length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            Fiber ID           |            Lambda ID          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Channel ID                          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The channel Id identifies the line rate that is used, e.g. OC-48,
   OC-192 in STM-1 channel steps (representing each bit) as proposed
   in [5].


3.  Port and Label Management Issues

3.1  Port Management Message

   No changes are currently seen as needed in the port management
   message.

3.2  Label Range Message

   An updated label range message is needed. An example of Lambda
   label ranges below.


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |T|Q|V|M|  Lambda Label (0x3xx) |          Label Length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |          Fiber ID             |        Minimum Lambda ID      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |          Reserved             |        Maximum Lambda ID      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Remaining Lambda ID                      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Label Range for a Specific Fiber ID (or port).

   There is also a need to address the support of multiplexing (e.g.
   no multiplexing, SONET multiplexing, Gigabit Ethernet multiplexing
   etc).

Internet Draft     Requirements for OLSR support      Jan 2000

   The semantics of T, Q, V and M bits are GSMP specific and
   described in [3] (chapter 5.2).


4.  Statistics messages

   No changes are currently proposed for the statistics messages to
   support optical switching.


5.  Configuration Issues

5.1  Switch Configuration

   No changes are currently proposed for the switch configuration
   messages to support optical switching.

5.2  Port Configuration

   The port configuration message supplies the controller with the
   configuration information related to a single port.  In order to
   handle the specific port types in a WDM switch, extensive
   additions will need to be made to this command.

   Port types will need to be added to support the mix of SONET
   signals that can operate over a single fiber.  Information that
   may need to be conveyed includes[7]:

         - wavelengths available on the fiber

         - serial bit rate per wavelength

         - type of fiber

5.3  Service Configuration

   While new capability sets will need to be added to support quality
   parameters in optical switches, no changes are foreseen to the
   service configuration message as its role to carry the service
   information as defined in the applicable service model. The
   changes related to the service model will be discussed in section
   6.


6.  Service Model issues

   While one assumption of using optical media is that bandwidth is
   plentiful, it should be expected that traffic engineering will be
   necessary in any case[4].  GSMP provides the means for each

Internet Draft     Requirements for OLSR support      Jan 2000

   connection, or in this each light trail, to be created with
   specific quality attributes. Certainly re-timing and re-shaping
   will need to be controlled.

   Currently, the default set of service models in GSMP are all based
   on the services models defined elsewhere, e.g. the intserv model,
   the diffserv model, ATM QoS models and the Frame relay forum QoS
   models. A determination needs to be made of the applicable quality
   models for optical channel trails. These models must then be
   mapped to the GSMP capability set mechanism.


7.  Encapsulation issues

   The working group needs to decide whether a new encapsulation is
   required.  In other words, will all optical switches used in
   either the MPLS over Optics and the IP over optics applications
   require that IP be implemented on the control channel connecting
   the GSMP controller and Optical switch (the GSMP target).  If a
   raw wavelength control connection is to be allowed, a new
   encapsulation will need to be added to the encapsulation
   document.[2]

   The authors of this draft recommend that IP be required on the
   control channel.


8.  MIB issues

   If a new encapsulation is defined, then the encapsulation group
   will need to be updated.  No other changes should be required.


9.  Security Considerations

   The security of GSMP's TCP/IP control channel has been addressed
   in [2]. Any potential remaining security considerations are not
   addressed in the current revision of this draft.
