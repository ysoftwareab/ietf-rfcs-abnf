Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it defines a minimal set of managed objects
for SNMP-based management of ISDN terminal interfaces.  ISDN interfaces
are supported on a variety of equipment (for data and voice) including
terminal adapters, bridges, hosts, and routers.

This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
definitions.

This document is a product of the ISDN MIB working group within the
Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
addressed to the working group's mailing list at isdn-mib@cisco.com
and/or the author.


1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three
major components.  They are:

o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
     accessing managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.


2.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

3.1.  Structure of MIB

For managing ISDN interfaces, the following information is necessary:

o    Information for managing physical interfaces. In case of ISDN
     primary rate, this will usually be T1 or E1 lines, being managed in
     the DS1/E1 MIB [12].  For Basic Rate lines, physical interfaces
     will be managed by this MIB.

o    Information for managing bearer channels, usually referred to as B
     channels.

o    Information for managing signaling channels.

o    Optionally, information for managing Terminal Endpoints (TE).  A
     Terminal Endpoint is a link layer connection to a switch.

o    Optionally, information for managing a list of directory numbers.


Within this document, this information has been structured into five
groups, which will be described in the following chapters.

In order to manage connections over ISDN lines, the management of
neighbors and call history information is required as well.  This
information will be defined in the Dial Control MIB.

The purpose for splitting the required information in two MIBs is to be
able to use parts of this information for non-ISDN interfaces as well.
In particular, the Dial Control MIB might also be used for other types
of interfaces.


3.1.1.  General Description

This MIB controls all aspects of ISDN interfaces.  It consists of five
groups.

o    The isdnMibBasicRateGroup is used to provide information regarding
     physical Basic Rate interfaces.

o    The isdnMibBearerGroup is used to control bearer channels, usually
     referred to as B channels. It supports configuration parameters as

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                   February 1996


     well as statistical information related to B channels.

o    The isdnMibSignalingGroup is used to control D channels.  There are
     three tables in this group. The isdnSignalingTable and
     isdnSignalingStatsTable support ISDN Network Layer configuration
     and statistics. The isdnLapdTable supports ISDN Data Link Layer
     (LAPD) configuration and statistics.

o    The optional isdnMibEndpointGroup can be used to specify Terminal
     Endpoints. It is required only if there are non-ISDN endpoints
     defined for a given D channel, or if additional information like
     Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) values or Service Profile
     IDentifiers (SPID) is required.

o    The optional isdnMibDirectoryGroup can be used to specify a list of
     directory numbers for each signaling channel. It is required only
     if the directory numbers to be accepted differ from the
     isdnSigTblCallingAddress as specified in the isdnSignalingTable.


3.2.  Relationship to RFC 1573

RFC 1573 [11], the Interface MIB Evolution, requires that any MIB module
which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas within
the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague in RFC
1573 to avoid over constraining the MIB module, thereby precluding
management of certain media-types.

Section 3.3 of RFC 1573 enumerates several areas which a media-specific
MIB module must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a
following subsection.  The implementor is referred to RFC 1573 in order
to understand the general intent of these areas.


3.2.1.  Layering Model

An ISDN interface usually consists of a D channel and a number of B
channels, all of which will be layered on top of a physical interface.

Furthermore, there are multiple interface layers for each D channel.
There are Data Link Layer (LAPD) as well as Network Layer entities.

This is accomplished in this MIB by creating a logical interface
(ifEntry) for each of the D channel entities and a logical interface
(ifEntry) for each of the B channels. These are then correlated to each

other and to the physical interface using the ifStack table of RFC 1573.

The basic model, therefore, looks something like this:

       | |
    +--+ +--+
    | D ch. |
    |Layer 3|
    +--+ +--+
       | |        | |            | |    <== interface to upper

    |         physical interface        |   by ifStack table
    |          (S/T, U or T1/E1)        |
    +-----------------------------------+

Mapping of B/D channels to physical interfaces


Each D channel can support multiple Terminal Endpoints.  Terminal
Endpoints can either be one or multiple ISDN signaling channels, or
channels supporting X.25 based packet mode services.

To accomplish this, there can be multiple Network Layer entities on top
of each ISDN Data Link Layer (LAPD) interface.  The detailed model
therefore looks something like this, including interface types as
examples:

Mapping of Terminal Endpoints (D channel Layer 3) to Layer 2 interfaces


IfEntries are maintained for each D channel Network Layer entity
(Terminal Endpoint), for LAPD and for each B channel.

The ifType for a Terminal Endpoint can be isdn(63) for ISDN signaling
channels or x25ple(40) for X.25 based packet mode services.  The ifType
for D channel Data Link Layer (LAPD) interfaces is lapd(77).  The ifType
for B channels is ds0(81).  The ifType for physical interfaces is the
matching IANA ifType, usually ds1(18) for Primary Rate interfaces or
ISDNs(75)/ISDNu(76) for Basic Rate interfaces.

The ifStackTable is used to map B channels and LAPD interfaces to
physical interfaces and to map D channel Network Layer interfaces
(Terminal Endpoints) to LAPD.

Mapping of B channels to upper interface layers will usually be done
using the Dial Control MIB. For example, mapping on top of B channels
might look as follows:

3.3.  ISDN interface specific information

3.3.1.  ISDN leased lines

ISDN leased lines can be specified on a per-B-channel basis.  To do so,
the value of isdnBearerChannelType has to be set to leased(2).  There
will be no signaling protocol support for leased line B channels, since
there is no signaling protocol action for this kind of interfaces.

If there is no signaling support available for an ISDN interface, this
must be specified in the according interface specific table.  For Basic
Rate interfaces, isdnBasicTblSignalMode of isdnBasicRateTable must be
set to inactive(2).  For Primary Rate interfaces, dsx1SignalMode of

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                   February 1996


dsx1ConfigTable in DS1/E1 MIB [12] must be set to none(1).  There will
be no isdnLapdTable or isdnSignalingTable entries for such interfaces.

Depending on the leased line type and the service provider, the D
channel can then eventually be used for data transfer.  To support this,
the D channel interface type will be ds0(81) instead of lapd(77) and its
usage will be identical to B channel usage if there is no signaling
channel available.

For a Primary Rate interface which is entirely used as a leased line,
there will be no ISDN specific information available or required.  Such
leased lines can entirely be handled by the DS1/E1 MIB.


3.3.2.  Hyperchannels

The switch protocol in use will define if hyperchannels are supported,
and the actual support will be implementation dependent. Hyperchannel
connections itself will be requested by the interface user, e.g. by the
neighbor connection handling procedures.

In the ISDN MIB, the isdnBearerStatsMultirate object of
isdnBearerStatsTable can be used to check if hyperchannels are being
used for an active call.

If hyperchannels are being used, there will be another interface layer
required to map multiple B channels to a single hyperchannel.  This is
accomplished by the DS0Bundle MIB [13].


3.3.3.  D channel backup and NFAS trunks

D channel backup is defined in Q.931 [8], Annex F.  It describes Non-
Associated signaling and its use and functionality is basically
identical to NFAS trunks.

Non Facility Accociated Signaling (NFAS) basically means that a D
channel on a PRI interface is used to manage calls on other PRI trunks.
This is required in North America for H11 channels, since all 24 time
slots are being used for bearer channels.

According to Q.931, Annex F, the D channel backup feature can be
provided on a subscription basis and is network dependent.  The D
channel backup procedure is described in detail in Q.931.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                   February 1996


For D channel backup, the controlling isdnSignalingTable entry will be
layered on top of all attached LAPD interfaces.  This layering will be
done using the ifStack table.  There will be only one active LAPD
interface, however.  Inactive LAPD interfaces will have an ifOperStatus
of dormant(5).

NFAS trunks will also be handled using the ifStack table. In this case,
a signaling channel will be layered on top of a LAPD interface as well
as on top of all physical interfaces which are controlled by the
signaling channel, but do not supply a D channel.


3.3.4.  X.25 based packet-mode service in D channel

X.25 based packet mode service over B channels can be handled using the
Dial Control MIB by creating an appropriate neighbor entry.  The
neighbor entry ifType can then be x25(5), thus providing access to X.25
service.

X.25 based packet mode service over D channels can be handled by
creating an ifEndpointTable entry with an isdnEndpointIfType of
x25ple(40).  The upper protocol layers can then be attached to this
interface using the ifStack table.


3.3.5.  SPID handling

Service Profile IDentifiers (SPIDs) are defined for BRI interfaces only,
and being used in North America.  SPIDs are required for DMS-100, NI-1
and NI-2, and are optional for 5ESS.  A switch can define up to 8 SPIDs
per BRI.

Each Terminal Endpoint has a SPID assigned.  It is normally built from
the party number (calling address for outgoing calls) with a number of
digits prepended and appended.  Since each network appears to be
different, both the calling address and the SPID have to be stored.

The SPID identifies the particular services that have been provisioned
for a terminal. If there are two B channels on a BRI, there can be two
SPIDs, one for each of the two B channels.  There can also be a single
SPID, providing access to both B channels.

The SPID gets registered with the switch after link establishment.
There is one data link for each SPID. As part of terminal registration,
an EID (Endpoint IDentifier) is defined by the switch.  On incoming

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                   February 1996


calls, the switch may provide the EID, a called party number, or both,
depending on the ISDN code implemented in the switch.

The EID has two bytes: USID (User Service IDentifier) and TID (Terminal
IDentifier). These are later used by some of the software versions
running on the switch side (e.g. compliant with NI-1, 5ESS custom) to
broadcast SETUP messages with these included, so the correct endpoint
would accept the call. Other switch software versions identify the
endpoint with the Called Party Number.

In the ISDN MIB, the SPID can be entered using the isdnEndpointSpid
object of isdnEndpointTable.  The isdnSigTblCallingAddress, already
being used to specify the calling number, cannot be used for this
purpose, since both may differ and be required in parallel.


3.3.6.  Closed User Groups

Closed User Groups (CUG), as defined in I.255.1 [14], are supported for
circuit mode calls by ETSI (ETS 300 138) and 1TR6.  In these networks,
an ISDN address can have one or more Closed User Groups assigned.  If
there is more than one Closed User Group assigned to a given address,
one of those will be the preferred Closed User Group.  For such
addresses, only calls from assigned Closed User Groups will be accepted
by the network.

Thus, Closed User Groups are a parameter for neighbor entries and will
be defined in the Dial Control MIB. A neighbor entry attached to a
Closed User Group will have to point to an ISDN interface which is
attached to the Closed User Group in question.


3.3.7.  Provision of point-to-point line topology

In the ISDN standards, there are two different meanings for the term
"point-to-point".

In ISDN standards, the term point-to-point will usually be used for data
link connections, i.e. layer 2 connections, where each layer 2
connection from the TE to the network is a single point-to-point
connection.  Multiple connections of this kind may exist on one physical
(layer 1) connection, however, and in case of Basic Rate interfaces
there may be several TE's connected to one physical line to the network.






Expires August 1996                                            [Page 17]




INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                   February 1996


The second meaning of "point-to-point" refers to the line topology, i.e.
to layer 1 connections.  For Primary Rate interfaces, the line topology
will always be point-to-point.  For Basic Rate interfaces, layer 1
point-to-point connections do exist in several countries, usually being
used for connecting PBX systems to the network.

The second meaning (layer 1 connections) is what will be referred to as
"point-to-point" connection throughout this document.

For Basic Rate interfaces, the isdnBasicRateTable object
isdnBasicTblLineTopology can be used to select the line topology.


3.3.8.  Speech and audio bearer capability information elements

The objects speech(2), audio31(6) and audio7(7), as being used in
isdnBearerStatsInfoType, refer to the Speech, 3.1 kHz Audio and old 7
kHz Audio (now Multi-use) bearer capabilities for ISDN, as defined in
Q.931 [8], chapter 4.5.5, octet 3 of bearer capability information
element.

These capabilities are signaling artifices that allow networks to do
certain things with the call.  It is up to the network to decide what to
do.

The Speech Bearer Capability means that speech is being carried over the
channel, as in two people talking.  This would be POTS-type speech.  The
network may compress this, encrypt it or whatever it wants with it as
long as it delivers POTS quality speech to the other end.  In other
words, a modem is not guaranteed to work over this connection.

The 3.1 kHz Audio capability indicates that the network carries the 3.1
kHz bandwidth across the network.  This would (theoretically) allow
modem signals to be carried across the network.  In the US, the network
automatically enters a capability of 3.1 kHz Audio on calls coming into
the ISDN from a POTS network.  This capability restricts the network
from interfering with the data channel in a way that would corrupt the
3.1 kHz VoiceBand data.

7 kHz Audio was meant to signal the use of a higher quality audio
connection (e.g., music from radio).  It was changed to Multi-Use
capability to allow it to be used for video-conferencing with fall back
to audio.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                   February 1996


In some cases, the Speech or 3.1 kHz Bearer Capability provides a 56
kbit/s data path through the network.  Therefore, some people are
setting up calls with the Speech or 3.1 kHz BC and transmitting 56
kbit/s data over the connection.  This is usually to take advantage of
favorable tariffs for Speech as opposed to Data.

On the incoming side, the equipment is usually configured to ignore the
Bearer Capability and either answer all Speech calls as 56 kbit/s data
or to use one Directory Number for real speech and another for data.
