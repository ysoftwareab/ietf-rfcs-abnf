Abstract

   This document describes generic requirements for Pseudo-Wire
   Emulation Edge to Edge. It provides guidelines for other working
   group documents that will define mechanisms for providing pseudo-wire
   emulation of specific services such as Ethernet, PPP, (Cisco) HDLC,
   ATM, Frame Relay and TDM. It should be noted that the PWE3 Working
   Group (WG) standardizes mechanisms that can be used to provide
   pseudo-wire emulation services, but not the services themselves.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Reference Model of Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge to Edge (PWE3)

   To provide pseudo-wire emulation, two end-services of the same type
   are first configured between each service endpoint (SE) and the
   corresponding PWE3 Edge (PE) device (See Figure 1).  An end-service
   is either:
     - an Ethernet link between two ports or two VLANs, or
     - a PPP link, or
     - a (Cisco) HDLC link, or
     - an ATM VC or VP, or
     - a Frame Relay VC, or
     - a TDM circuit.
   A connection is then set up between the two PEs to connect these two
   end-services. This connection is called a pseudo-wire in the PWE3
   context. During the setup of a pseudo-wire, the two pseudo-wire
   endpoints will exchange information about the service to be emulated
   so that later they know how to handle packets coming from the other
   end of the pseudo-wire. After the pseudo-wire is set up, layer-2
   (e.g. Ethernet, ATM and Frame Relay) or layer-1 (e.g. SONET/SDH) PDUs
   of frames from an end-service are encapsulated at the pseudo-wire
   ingress. The encapsulated PDUs are then transported over the pseudo-
   wire to the egress, where L2 or L1 header information is re-
   constructed and the resulted frames are forwarded in their native
   format to the other end-service.

          |<---------------- emulated service ---------------->|

                  Figure 1: Pseudo-Wire Reference Model

   Different carriers may choose different types of pseudo-wires. For
   example, carriers may choose to use GRE tunnels [GRE], L2TP tunnels
   [L2TP], or MPLS LSPs [MPLS] as pseudo-wires. This document does not
   assume that a particular type of pseudo-wires is used. Instead, it
   describes generic requirements that apply to all pseudo-wires, for
   all services including Ethernet, PPP, (Cisco) HDLC, ATM, Frame Relay
   and TDM.

   This document is not an introductory document. Readers are assumed to
   be familiar with the PWE3 framework document [PATE], especially the
   architecture assumptions stated in that document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   Below are the definitions for the terms used throughout the document.

   End-Service             An End-Service is either an Ethernet link
                           between two ports or two VLANs, or a PPP
                           link, or a (Cisco) HDLC link, or an ATM VC or
                           VP, or a Frame Relay VC, or a TDM circuit.

   Pseudo-Wire Emulation   Pseudo-Wire Emulation is an approach to
                           emulate the essential attributes of a service
                           over a packet network so that two remote
                           end-services appear directly connected by a
                           wire.

   Emulated Service        An Emulated Service is a service that is
                           provided via pseudo-wire emulation.

   Service Endpoint        A Service Endpoint (SE) is a device where one
                           end of an emulated service terminates.

   Pseudo-Wire             A Pseudo-Wire is a connection between two
                           end-services.

   Pseudo-Wire Endpoint    A Pseudo-Wire Endpoint is a device where one
                           end of a pseudo-wire terminates.

   Path-oriented           A Path-oriented Pseudo-Wire is a pseudo-wire
   Pseudo-Wire             for which core network devices must maintain
                           state information, for example, an MPLS LSP.

   Non-path-oriented       A Non-path-oriented Pseudo-Wire is a
   Pseudo-Wire             pseudo-wire for which core network devices
                           need not maintain state information, for
                           example, a L2TP tunnel.

   Transport Tunnel        A Transport Tunnel is a tunnel inside which
                           multiple pseudo-wires can be nested so that

                           they are transparent to core network devices.

2.  PDU Encapsulation

   Every pseudo-wire edge device MUST provide service interfaces to use
   common service-specific techniques for encapsulating PDUs.  It should
   be noted that the PDUs to be encapsulated may or may not contain L2
   or L1 header information.  This is service specific.  Every PWE3
   service MUST specify what a PDU is.

   A pseudo-wire header must contain sufficient but not excessive
   information so that the other end of the pseudo-wire, aided with
   information obtained during the pseudo-wire setup process, knows
   exactly how to handle the encapsulated PDUs. A pseudo-wire header
   consists of all the header fields in an encapsulated PDU that are
   used by the pseudo-wire egress to determine how to handled the PDU.
   The header that is used for transporting the encapsulated PDUs from
   the pseudo-wire ingress to the egress (e.g. the tunnel label in
   [MART2]) is not considered as part of the pseudo-wire header.  It is
   called transport header instead. It should be noted that transport
   headers are totally different from transport-layer headers (e.g.
   TCP/UDP headers).

   Specific requirements on PDU encapsulation for a PWE3 approach are
   listed below.

2.1.  Conveyance of Necessary L2/L1 Header Information

   Sometimes the egress of a pseudo-wire needs some L2 or L1 header
   information in order to know how to process the PDUs received.  A
   PWE3 approach SHOULD provide some mechanism (e.g. using one or more
   control words) for conveying such L2/L1 header information from the
   pseudo-wire ingress to the egress. The use of these mechanisms can be
   REQUIRED or OPTIONAL, depending on services.

2.2.  Location of the Pseudo-Wire Header

   A pseudo-wire header MUST be between the PDU and the transport
   header. This is necessary for the pseudo-wire egress to locate the
   pseudo-wire header, and to process the PDU.

2.3.  PDU Length

   A PWE3 approach MUST accommodate variable length PDUs, if variable
   length PDUs are allowed by the native service.  For example, a PWE3
   approach for Frame Relay MUST accommodate variable length frames.

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

2.4.  Encapsulation of Signaling Messages of the Native Services

   PDUs that contain signaling information of the native service SHOULD
   be encapsulated in the same way as data PDUs. This simplifies
   handling at both the ingress and the egress of a pseudo-wire.

2.5.  Timing Information

   Timing information can be essential for the endpoints of a service.
   If the original frames contain timing information, the encapsulation
   mechanism SHOULD not cause loss of such timing information.
   Requirements on clock recovery between pseudo-wire endpoints are
   further discussed in the "Maintenance of Emulated Services" section.

2.6.  Support for Circuit Multiplexing

   If a service in its native form is capable of grouping multiple
   circuits into a "trunk", e.g. an ATM VP, some mechanism SHOULD be
   provided so that a single pseudo-wire can be used to connect two
   end-trunks.  From encapsulation perspective, the encapsulation header
   MUST carry sufficient information, e.g. VCI of each cell, so that the
   egress of the pseudo-wire can demultiplex individual circuits from
   the pseudo-wire.

2.7.  Packet Ordering

   When packets carrying the encapsulated PDUs traverse a pseudo-wire,
   they may arrive at the egress out of order. For some services, the
   encapsulated PDUs must be delivered in order. For such services, some
   mechanism MUST be provided to ensure that. Providing a sequence
   number in the pseudo-wire header for each packet is one possible
   approach. Every specific PWE3 approach MUST define as a mechanism if
   in-order PDU delivery is required.

3.  Packet Transport

   This section describes requirements on how to transport packets
   carrying the encapsulated PDUs over the network that provides PWE3
   services.

3.1.  Setup of Pseudo-Wires

   A pseudo-wire is a tunnel that connects two end-services. After the
   L2/L1 PDUs of a service are encapsulated, they must be transported
   over the pseudo-wire to the other end-service.

   Every PWE3 approach MUST define some signaling mechanism for setting
   up the pseudo-wires. During the setup process, the pseudo-wire

Expires 11/2001    Xiao/McPherson/Pate/White/Kompella           [Page 7] 
Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   endpoints need to exchange some information (e.g. learn each other's
   capability).  The signaling mechanism MUST enable the pseudo-wire
   endpoints to exchange all necessary information.  For example, both
   endpoints must agree on an encapsulation method and the MTU size for
   the pseudo-wire. As another example, in order to support circuit
   multiplexing using ATM VPs, both pseudo-wire endpoints must agree on
   using the VCIs in the encapsulated PDUs to demultiplex individual VCs
   from the VP at the pseudo-wire egress.  Which signaling protocol to
   use and what information to exchange are service specific. Every PWE3
   approach MUST specify these.  Manual configuration can be considered
   as a special kind of signaling and is explicitly allowed.

   This document does not assume a particular type of pseudo-wires. GRE
   tunnels, L2TP tunnels, or MPLS LSPs can all be used. Selection of a
   particular type of pseudo-wires is carrier-dependent and is outside
   scope of the PWE3 WG.

   A pseudo-wire can be either path-oriented or non-path-oriented. The
   difference is core network devices need to maintain state information
   for path-oriented pseudo-wires (e.g. LSPs) but not for non-path-
   oriented ones (e.g. GRE/L2TP tunnels).  This has scalability
   implication that is further discussed in the "Scalability" section.

3.2.  Pseudo-Wire MTU

   A pseudo-wire MUST be able to be configured with an MTU that is
   sufficient to transport packets whose size equals to the largest PDU
   size of the native service plus the pseudo-wire header and transport
   header. At a pseudo-wire ingress, if a packet's length exceeds the
   pseudo-wire MTU, it MUST be dropped. At a pseudo-wire egress, if the
   length of a frame that is restored from a PDU exceeds the MTU of
   destination end-service, it MUST be dropped.

3.3.  Transport of Signaling Messages of the Native Services

   Some native services use signaling messages for maintaining the
   circuits. These signaling messages may be in-band, e.g. Ethernet flow
   control or ATM performance management, or out-of-band, e.g. the
   signaling VC of an ATM VP (from the perspective of other VCs in that
   VP).  If such signaling messages are lost, functionality of the
   services will be significantly affected. Therefore, it can be
   desirable to provide higher reliability for transporting signaling
   messages.

   Each PWE3 approach MAY state what approach can be used to ensure that
   signaling messages of the native service will be delivered over the
   network with high probability. Differentiating signaling packets from
   data packets and giving them preferable forwarding treatment in the
   network is one possible approach.  Such approaches NEED not be

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   defined in a PWE3 approach itself.

3.4.  Transport Efficiency

   In order to reduce transport header overhead and increase bandwidth
   efficiency, multiple PDUs MAY be concatenated before a transport
   header is added. Each PDU still carries its own pseudo-wire header so
   that the egress of the pseudo-wire knows how to handle it.

4.  Faithfulness of Emulated Services

   An emulated service SHOULD be as similar to the native service as
   possible, but it is not REQUIRED that they should be identical. Each
   difference between an emulated service and the corresponding native
   service, if any, can be classified as either functional or non-
   functional.  Functional differences are those that cause some
   features of the native service to become disabled in the emulated
   one. For example, if an emulated Ethernet service introduces some
   difference that can cause the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to mal-
   function, such a difference will be classified as a functional
   difference.  Other differences are non-functional.  For examples,
   differences in service quality between an emulated service and the
   native one are non-functional.  In every PWE3 approach:

   - All functional differences and the features disabled MUST be
     pointed out;

   - Non-functional differences SHOULD be pointed out.

   Some basic requirements on faithfulness of an emulated service are
   described below.

4.1.  Characteristics of an Emulated Service

   Functionally, two service endpoints that are connected by an emulated
   service MUST appear directly connected by a native service, although
   service quality of the emulated service may be different from that of
   a native one. Specifically, this implies (but is not limited to) the
   followings:

   1) It MUST be possible to define type (e.g. Ethernet or PPP, which is
      inherited from the native service), speed (e.g. 100Mbps), and MTU
      size for an emulated service.

   2) From the service endpoints' perspective, each emulated service
      MUST appear as unshared.


Expires 11/2001    Xiao/McPherson/Pate/White/Kompella           [Page 9] 
Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   3) If an emulated service fails (either at one of the end-services or
      in the middle of the pseudo-wire), both service endpoints MUST be
      notified reasonably timely.  The definition of "reasonable
      timeliness" is service-dependent.

   4) Two service endpoints connected by an emulated service MUST be
      able to establish routing protocol (e.g. IGP) adjacency over the
      emulated service. To be clear, the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is
      not considered as a routing protocol and requirements on
      support/non-support of STP is outside scope of this document.

   5) When desired, an emulated service MUST be able to appear as a
      normal link in the service endpoints' IGP routing table.

   6) The TTL fields of the encapsulated PDUs, if exist, MUST not be
      changed inside an emulated service.

4.2.  Service Quality of Emulated Services

   It is RECOMMENDED but not REQUIRED that an emulated service provide
   as high service quality as the native service.  However, the PWE3 WG
   only defines mechanisms for providing pseudo-wire emulation, not the
   services themselves. What quality to provide for a specific emulated
   service is a matter between a service provider (SP) and its
   customers, and is outside scope of the PWE3 WG. In fact, different
   SPs can use the same PWE3 approach but different QoS approaches to
   provide the same emulated service with different service quality.

4.3.  Signaling of Native Services

   A PWE3 approach SHOULD support signaling of the native service. This
   is further discussed in the "Maintenance of Emulated Services"
   section.

5.  Maintenance of Emulated Services

   Every PWE3 approach MUST provide mechanisms for maintaining the
   working condition of an emulated service and for signaling any status
   changes.

5.1.  Signaling of Status Changes of an Emulated Service

5.1.1.  Up/Down Notification

   With pseudo-wire emulation, a failure may occur at a remote place
   such that one or both physical links between the SEs and PEs remains
   up.  For example in Figure 1, if the physical link between SE1 and
   PE1 fails, the physical link between SE2 and PE2 will not be affected

Expires 11/2001    Xiao/McPherson/Pate/White/Kompella          [Page 10] 
Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   and will remain up. Unless some signaling is done to notify SE2 of
   the remote failure, SE2 will continue to send traffic over the
   emulated service to SE1. Such traffic will be discarded at PE1.
   Therefore, when an emulated service fails (either at an end-service
   or in the middle of the pseudo-wire), both service endpoints MUST be
   notified.  Every PWE3 approach MUST provide such a signaling
   mechanism. This functionality is equivalent to failure notification
   of normal links.

   Similarly, every PWE3 approach MUST provide some signaling mechanism
   so that when a network failure is fixed, all the affected emulated
   services will change status from "Down" to "Up".

5.1.2.  Packet Loss and/or Out-of-order Delivery

   A pseudo-wire can incur packet loss and/or out-of-order delivery.
   This can significantly impact the working condition of an emulated
   service.  Number of packets lost or delivered out of order in unit
   time can be considered as two new types of "generalized bit error
   rate" of a pseudo-wire. Every PWE3 approach SHOULD provide some
   mechanism so that if either type of "generalized bit error rate"
   exceeds some configured threshold, the pseudo-wire and the emulated
   service will be signaled down.

5.1.3.  Other Status Signaling

   A PWE3 approach MAY provide mechanism for other status signaling, if
   any.

5.1.4.  Collective Status Signaling

   Status of a group of emulated services may be affected identically by
   a single network incidence.  For example, when the physical link
   between a SE and a PE fails, all the emulated services that go
   through that link will fail.  It is likely that there exists a group
   of emulated services which all terminate at a remote SE. (There can
   be multiple such SEs). Therefore, it is desirable that a single
   signaling message can be used to signal the failure of the whole
   group of emulated services.  A PWE3 approach MAY provide some
   mechanism for signaling status changes of a group of emulated
   circuits.  One possible approach is to associate each emulated
   service with a group ID when the pseudo-wire for that emulated
   service is set up. Multiple emulated services can then be grouped by
   associated them with identical group ID. In status signaling, that
   group ID can then be used to refer all the emulated services in that
   group.

5.2.  Clock Recovery

   For some services, the pseudo-wire endpoints need to maintain some
   kind of timing relationship (e.g. synchronization). A PWE3 approach
   for such services MUST provide some mechanism to support that.

6.  Management of Emulated Services

   Each PWE3 approach SHOULD provide some mechanisms for network
   operators to manage the emulated service.

6.1.  MIB

   A pseudo-wire MIB (PW-MIB) MAY be provided for managing each emulated
   service.  The MIB SHOULD have the following requirements:

   - The counters in the MIB SHOULD NOT replicate existing MIB counters.

   - Each end-service SHOULD appear as an interface in the ifTable.

   - The MIB SHOULD describe how the existing counters are used for
     pseudo-wire emulation.

   - The MIB MAY support row creation to create new end-service pairs.

   - The MIB MAY augment existing tables.  For example, the ifTable
     SHOULD be augmented to provide counts of out-of-order packets.

   - The MIB SHOULD define meanings for the standard linkUp and linkDown
     traps, as well as any protocol-specific traps that are needed.

   - The MIB SHOULD be structured in a hierarchical fashion such that
     generic PW objects and tables are not duplicated for each service.

6.2.  Pseudo-Wire Traceroute

   It can be desirable to know the exact path of a pseudo-wire,
   especially for troubleshooting purpose. A pseudo-wire emulation
   service MAY support pseudo-wire traceroute, even if the pseudo-wire
   used is non-path-oriented.

7.  Scalability

   Scalability requirements for Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge to Edge are
   described below.

Expires 11/2001    Xiao/McPherson/Pate/White/Kompella          [Page 12] 
Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   - Pseudo-wire emulation services SHOULD be transparent to other
     packet services (e.g. best effort Internet service).

   - Only pseudo-wire endpoints should be aware of existence of pseudo-
     wires and PWE3 services. Core network devices SHOULD NOT be exposed
     to a large number of pseudo-wires.

     Pseudo-wires can be path-oriented or non-path-oriented. For path-
     oriented pseudo-wires, core network devices must maintain state
     information for them. If a large number of path-oriented pseudo-
     wires are used, core network devices will have to maintain a large
     amount of state information. In order to avoid scalability problem,
     transport tunnels between pseudo-wire endpoints can be introduced.
     Pseudo-wires from the same ingress to the same egress are nested
     inside the transport tunnel that is from that ingress to that
     egress. By creating such a tunnel hierarchy, individual pseudo-
     wires are transparent to the core devices.  If a specific PWE3
     approach uses path-oriented pseudo-wires, transport tunnels SHOULD
     be used to improve scalability.  However, a transport tunnel is not
     part of any pseudo-wire. Signaling of transport tunnels NEED NOT be
     defined in the PWE3 approach itself. As an example, if LSPs are
     used as pseudo-wires in a PWE3 approach, they can be nested inside
     a tunnel LSP from the pseudo-wire ingress to the pseudo-wire
     egress.  The tunnel LSPs can be signaled by any mechanism defined
     in [MPLS].

   - Circuit multiplexing: circuit multiplexing SHOULD be supported.

   - Collective status signaling: Collective status signaling SHOULD be
     supported.

8.  Other Generic Requirements

   Other generic requirements for Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge to Edge
   include:

   - No New Protocol Operations:

     No matter which protocol (e.g. GRE or L2TP or MPLS) is used for
     packet transport, PWE3 SHOULD just be an application of that
     protocol. In other words, no new protocol (GRE or L2TP or MPLS)
     operations SHOULD be introduced.  For example, if an MPLS label
     switching operation is performed, a PWE3 approach SHOULD not
     require that the TTL field of the top label remains unchanged.
     (Otherwise, this label switching would be different from a normal
     MPLS label switching and would be considered as a new protocol
     operation). If any new operations are indeed introduced in a PWE3
     approach, they MUST be clearly pointed out.

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   - Minimum configuration work at the pseudo-wire endpoints;

   - Easy to maintain and manage.

9.  Non-Requirements

   Some non-requirements are mentioned in various sections of this
   document. Those work items are outside scope of the PWE3 WG.  The
   non-requirements are listed below:

   - Selection of a particular type of pseudo-wires;

   - Striving to make the emulated services perfectly match their native
     services;

   - Defining mechanisms for signaling the transport tunnels;

   - Defining how to perform traffic management on packets that carry
     encapsulated PDUs;

   - Providing security for the encapsulated PDUs;

   - Providing any multicast service that is not native to the emulated
     medium.

     To illustrate this point, Ethernet transmission to a multicast
     IEEE-48 address is considered in scope, while multicast services
     like [MARS] that are implemented on top of the medium are out of
     scope;

10.  Quality of Service (QoS) Considerations

   In this document, QoS means satisfactory service quality.  It should
   not be confused with QoS mechanisms such as Weighted Fair Queueing
   (WFQ) or Random Early Detection (RED).

   QoS is essential for ensuring that the emulated services are similar
   (but not necessarily identical) to their native forms. It is up to
   network operators to decide how to provide QoS - They can choose to
   rely on over-provisioning and/or deploy some QoS mechanisms.

   In order to take advantage of some QoS mechanisms defined in other
   working groups, e.g. the traffic management schemes defined in
   DiffServ WG, it is desirable that some mechanisms exists for
   differentiating the packets resulted from PDU encapsulation. These
   mechanisms need not be defined in the PWE3 approaches themselves. For

Internet Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-requirements-00         May 17, 2001

   example, if the resulted packets are MPLS or IP packets, their EXP or
   DSCP fields can be used for marking and differentiating,
   respectively.  Every PWE3 approach SHOULD provide guidelines for
   marking and differentiating, e.g. what fields in the original L2 or
   L1 headers should be used for determining the EXP/DSCP value. But the
   exact procedure on how to perform marking and differentiating, e.g.
   the mapping from Ethernet .1P field to EXP field, is out of scope.

11.  Inter-domain Pseudo-Wires

   The PWE3 WG will determine the requirements for having a pseudo-wire
   pass across an administrative boundary.  An edge could be a native
   hand-off or hand-off to a further pseudo-wire.  The working group may
   analyze requirements for both security and performance for the
   inter-administration technology. This topic is for further study.

12.  Security Considerations

12.1.  Security Considerations for the Signaling/Control Channel

   If a signaling/control channel is used in a PWE3 approach, some
   security mechanism SHOULD be provided to ensure integrity of the
   information transmitted across the signaling/control channel.

12.2.  Security Considerations for the Encapsulated PDUs

   Providing security for the encapsulated PDUs is outside scope of the
   PWE3 WG.

13.  Deployment Considerations

   Transition from using separate networks for TDM, ATM, Frame Relay and
   IP services to using a single network for multiple services requires
   careful planning and execution.  This is an important topic for
   further study.
