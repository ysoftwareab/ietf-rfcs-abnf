1.  Introduction

   IER [RFC8279](Bit Index Explicit Replication) is an alternative
   method of multicast forwarding.  It does not require any multicast-
   specific trees, and hence does not require any multicast-specific
   tree building protocols.  Due to the particular sensitivity of adding
   new significant functionality into the data-plane, the BIER work
   began progress as Experimental.  The current status of the experiment
   is documented in this draft and is intended to provide justification
   for re-charting the BIER Working Group (WG) as Standards Track and to
   move all published documents of the BIER WG to Standards Track.  This
   document will detail the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using
   BIER instead of traditional multicast forwarding mechanisms, as
   required by the BIER WG Charter charter-ietf-bier-01

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  IP Multicast Challenges

   Current IP Multicast solutions require a tree-building control plane
   to build and maintain end-to-end tree state per flow, impacting
   router state capacity and network convergence times.  Multi-point
   tree building protocols are often considered complex to deploy and
   debug and may include mechanics from legacy use-cases and/or
   assumptions which no longer apply to the current use-cases.  When
   multicast services are transiting a provider network through an
   overlay, the core network has a choice to either aggregate customer

   state into a minimum set of core states resulting in flooding traffic
   to unwanted network end-points, or to map per-customer, per-flow tree
   state directly into the provider core state amplifying the network-
   wide state problem.  Though the value proposition of network
   replication is high, the cost of deploying IP Multicast is often
   considered too high to justify deployment.

3.  Benefits of BIER

   BIER is a radical simplification of IP Multicast.  BIER has no tree-
   building protocol.  BIER has no end-to-end tree/flow state.  BIER has
   no RPF requirements.  BIER packets follow the same path to a
   destination as a unicast packet would take to the same destination.
   BIER provides deterministic convergence times regardless of how many
   (S,G)s are being transported through the BIER network.  BIER can be
   deployed in SDN-driven deployment models, that minimize protocols
   required in a network as well by eliminating multicast protocols and
   relying on IGP infrastructure or direct SDN programmability.

4.  Trade Offs

   BIER is intended to carry IP Multicast packets - though not
   explicitly restricted to this - across an overlay.  Therefore, BIER
   is not end-to-end like IP Multicast.  This isn't an inherent
   tradeoff, but it does focus the scope of the solution and the
   discussion.  The lack of (S,G) state often comes up as a perceived
   limitation.  But considering IP Unicast does not have active flow
   state in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) of each node, the
   expectation that Multicast needs flow state for debugging purposes is
   more of an artifact of legacy solutions rather than a requirement.
   Debugging individual flows in BIER will require unicast techniques
   such as flow export tools rather than forwarding state entries of IP
   Multicast.  BIER's primary limitation is the size of the bitmask.
   The BIER architecture requires 256 bit mask support, but can
   accommodate larger and smaller masks.  As the masks get larger (+1024
   bits) transport tax begins to exceed what is reasonable. 256 to 1024
   end nodes of a BIER domain could then be considered a limitation.
   Larger numbers of end nodes can be addressed with the use of BIER
   Sets or via multiple BIER domains.

   Because BIER is a forwarding plane feature significantly different
   from IP Unicast or Multicast, not all routers today can be programmed
   to support BIER.  Transition mechanisms have already been introduced
   to facility migration to an expanding BIER domain.

5.  Impact of BIER on the Forwarding Plane

   Bitmask forwarding techniques have been used in embedded systems and
   software communication for decades.  BIER is the first time the
   mechanism has been extended to address distributed forwarding and
   replication across a network.  Though the BIER forwarding rules are
   different than IP forwarding, it is significantly simpler than IP
   Multicast forwarding.  Detailed description of BIER forwarding is
   documented in RFC8279.  The BIER forwarding logic is simple, and the
   state requirements minimal enough, that some existing micro-codable
   forwarding hardware is programmable to support BIER today.  It is
   expected that dedicated BIER forwarding hardware will be developed to
   extend the solution beyond micro-codable forwarding hardware - that
   is expected to then further reduce hardware costs.  Multiple router
   vendors and chip vendors either have plans to support BIER or will be
   announcing new products with BIER support very soon.  In addition,
   multiple operators are now actively evaluating and planning the
   deployment of BIER for multicast delivery in their networks.  This
   validates BIER as next generation technology for multicast delivery.

6.  Conclusion

   The overall benefits of BIER over traditional IP Multicast are quite
   significant, and the value of network replication is so well
   understood, that operator and vendor engagement and support for BIER
   was strong from the beginning and has only grown over time.  It is
   expected that BIER adoption will begin to take over as the dominant
   network replication transport in all networks where traditional IP
   Multicast is used today.  It is our recommendation that the BIER work
   and all existing BIER published RFCs be moved from the Experimental
   track to the Standards track.
