 1. Introduction  
     
    Telephony traffic is conventionally carried over connection-
    oriented synchronous or plesiosynchronous networks (which will be 
    loosely called TDM networks herein). With the proliferation of 
    packet-switched networks (PSNs), telephony carriers desire 
    integration of TDM services into a unified PSN infrastructure. 
    This integration requires emulation of TDM circuits within the 
    PSN, a function that can be carried out using Pseudo Wires (PWs), 
    as described in the PWE3 requirements [PWE-REQ] and framework 
    [PWE-FR] documents. This emulation must ensure QoS and voice 
    quality similar to those of existing circuit-based networks as 
    well as preserving signaling features. 
     
     
     
 2. Applicability Statement 
  
    2.1 Reliability 
    A method of transporting TDM traffic over PWs must take into 
    account a customer's expectations regarding end-to-end behavior of 
    TDM services. Customers have become accustomed to "five nine" 
    reliability, meaning that the infrastructure functions correctly 
    99.999 percent of the time.  
     
    Due to the limitations of packet switched networks (PSNs), it will 
    not be possible to maintain this level of service reliability in 
    PW emulations of TDM services. Instead we suggest requiring "three 
    nines" reliability. This means in particular, that no more than

    one in a thousand calls will be disconnected prematurely, no more 
    than one in a thousand initiations will be misrouted, etc. 
     
    When transporting SS7 signaling, the availability and 
    dependability performance objectives of [Q.766] are not expected 
    to be met unless further mechanisms are put in place. 
     
     
    2.2 TDM traffic types 
    A method for transporting TDM traffic over PWs MUST be able to 
    handle all of the following types of TDM traffic 
    [G.703,G.704,G.751,T1.107] 
     
       n*64K 
       unstructured T1 
       unstructured E1 
       structured T1 without CAS 
       structured E1 without CAS 
       structured T1 with CAS 
       structured E1 with CAS 
       T3 
       E3 
     
    The traffic may consist of any combination of multiplexed voice, 
    voice-band data, or leased-line services. 
     
     
    2.3 Timing transport 
    TDM circuits need to maintain jitter and wander to within limits 
    specified by the relevant standards [G.823,G.824]. In all cases a 
    jitter buffer will be required to be supplied by the edge devices, 
    in order to allow compensation for the packet delay variation of 
    the underlying PSN. 
     
    If a reliable local source of timing is not available, clock 
    information MUST be transferred edge to edge. Although some 
    degradation in the stratum level is to be expected, the recovered 
    clock must conform to the standards. 
     
     
    2.4 TDM Alarms 
    Standard TDM alarms MUST be both transferred edge to edge and MUST 
    be generated when required. 
     
     
    2.5 Latency 
    Latency and hence round trip delay may increase when transporting 
    over a PW. Since round-trip delay may not conform to what is 
    termed "acceptable for most user applications" in [G.114], 
    mechanisms for reducing latency (such as trading off reduced 
    efficiency for reduced latency) SHOULD be provided.

    2.6 Audio Quality 
    For voice traffic the voice quality MUST be similar to those of 
    existing circuit-based networks, but may suffer minor degradation 
    due to increased delay and jitter. [P.800] 
     
    Non-voice, in-band signals required for the proper operation of 
    the public switched telephone network MUST be transported 
    sufficiently accurately as to enable their detection and disallow 
    their false-alarms, in order to maintain proper operation 
    according to their normative standards. Such signals include dual 
    tone multifrequency (DTMF) tones, the 2100 Hz tone including any 
    associated phase reversals and amplitude modulations, 
    multifrequency tones incorporated in the various signaling systems 
    of the PSTN, and tones used in national signaling systems for 
    ring-back, busy and congestions indication. 
     
    Voice-band modem transmissions MUST be transported sufficiently 
    accurately as to enable their essentially unimpaired operation. 
     
     
    2.7 Echo cancellation 
    Echo cancellation conforming to [G.168] MUST be provided whenever 
    the emulated service would have provided it. In addition, due to 
    latency often exceeding that of the emulated service, echo 
    cancellation MUST be provided whenever the latency exceeds 30 
    milliseconds and echo cancellation is not otherwise provided. 
     
     
    2.8 CAS signaling 
    When present, CAS signaling MUST be transparently transferred edge 
    to edge. The precise phase of signaling bits inside multiframes 
    need not always be retained. 
     
    Since CAS signaling bits can be used to transport hooking, hook-
    flash, and pulse dialing indications, CAS transition timings and 
    durations MUST be maintained. 
     
    2.9 CCS signaling 
    Trunk associated CCS signaling (e.g. [Q.700]) MUST be transferred 
    edge to edge. For HDLC type payloads the precise number of idle 
    flags may not be preserved, and to conserve bandwidth, unnecessary 
    flags SHOULD be removed. 
     
    2.10 PSN Bandwidth Conservation 
    In order to conserve PSN bandwidth the encapsulation overhead 
    SHOULD be kept to a minimum. 
     
    Whenever possible, PSN bandwidth conservation techniques such as 
    dynamic bandwidth allocation (whereby only active timeslots are 
    transported), SHOULD be employed.
