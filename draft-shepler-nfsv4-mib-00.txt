Title                       NFS version 4 MIB                   May 2003


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which
   describe the behavior of an SNMP entity, as defined in the SNMP
   architecture STD 62, [RFC3411].


2.  Discussion

   The reader of this MIB is assumed to be familiar with the NFS version
   4 protocol, as defined in [RFC3530].  In the tradition of the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) this MIB defines the minimum
   number of objects necessary for providing as rich a set of management
   information.  Thus, this MIB provides a set of objects from which
   other management information may be derived.  Additionally, this MIB
   structure is intended to satisfy fault, configuration, performance,
   accounting, and security management for an NFS version 4 server
   implementation.  There may be a need for providing a MIB for the
   client side implementation of the protocol, as well as intermediaries
   such as a file cache.  This will be covered in a future MIB
   definition.

   It is currently structured around objects such as clients,
   filesystems and operations in the context of a filesystem.  Note that
   while it may be possible to provide information at the granularity of
   a file, that would potentially increase the amount of information
   that would have to be collected.

   The root of the objects in this MIB is the nfsv4mgmt object.  Below
   this object, the following tables exist.

   serverTable lists all server instances that the SNMP agent provides
   objects for.

   fsTable lists all root-level filesystem instances known.  This table
   contains an entry for each fs_root pathname that this server would
   present in a fs_locations attribute.

   fsLockTable lists all locks and information related to locks, on a
   per file system basis.

   Each object contains a fairly standard list of statistics.  Some
   would appear to be redundant, and could be computed from lower-level
   objects.  However, some of the objects are transient (clients, and
   even filesystems), so we felt that duplicating them was not too high
   of a price for the availability of good information.

   There are no doubt still some important statistics and other
   information still missing; the authors would welcome any comments.
   One area where there could be quite a bit of value is in tracking the
   RPC layer as well.
