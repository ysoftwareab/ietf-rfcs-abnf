Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks           September 2006


1.  Introduction

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) design
   provides support for various types of deployments.  DSL networks were
   identified as a typical example of such a deployment.  This document
   provides guidelines for PANA deployment over DSL access networks.
   The document specifically describes the introduction of PANA in DSL
   networks migrating from a traditional PPP access model to a pure IP-
   based access environment.  In such environment, additional
   authentication mechanisms are required to provide a complete secure
   network access solution to Network Access Providers (NAP) willing to
   overtake inadequate methods such as basic DSL link-layer
   identification or application-layer ad-hoc authentication mechanisms
   (e.g., HTTP redirects with web-based login).


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the PANA terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].
   This document uses the DSL Forum terminology defined in [TR25],
   [TR59] and [WT146].


4.  PANA Framework Overview

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a
   link-layer agnostic transport for EAP [RFC3748] to enable network
   access authentication between clients and access networks.

   The motivation to define such a protocol and the requirements are
   described in [RFC4058].  Protocol details are documented in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].  There are components that are part of a
   complete secure network access solution but are outside of the PANA
   protocol specification, including IP address configuration,
   authentication method choice, filter rule installation, data traffic
   protection, PAA-EP protocol and PAA discovery.  These components
   except for IP address configuration (see Appendix A of
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana]) are described in separate documents (see
   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework], [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp] and
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-paa-option].

   networks were identified as a typical example of such a deployment
   (see Appendix A of [RFC4058]).


5.  PANA in DSL environment

5.1.  Evolution of DSL Environment

   Traditional DSL deployments followed the architectural guidelines
   provided in [TR25] or [TR59].  Theses architectures use ATM to
   aggregate the access networks into a regional broadband network.  The
   traffic aggregated from the access nodes (DSLAM) is steered to an IP
   node, the Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  In this
   environment, PPP sessions are set-up between the CPN (Customer
   Premises Network) and the BRAS, which acts as either a PPP
   termination point or a L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) tunnelling
   multiple subscriber PPP sessions directly to an Internet/Corporate
   Service Provider.  The CPN is usually defined as the combination of
   the DSL Modem/RG, acting as the termination point of the physical DSL
   signal, and the subscriber's computers and other devices (named hosts
   hereafter) connected to the DSL Modem/RG.

   The devices at the customer premises have been shown as "hosts" in
   the above network.

   DSL architectures are now emerging from a "low" speed best effort
   delivery network to an infrastructure capable of supporting higher
   subscriber bit rates.  At the application layer, DSL service
   providers are looking to support enhanced services layered on top of
   basic Internet access, including entertainment video services
   (Broadcast TV and VoD), video conferencing, VoIP, gaming, and
   business class services (e.g.  IP VPN), that have prohibitive
   requirements to deploy them in a pure ATM based environment.  Moving
   to on a Gigabit Ethernet instead of an ATM aggregation network offers
   an highly efficient transport technology for delivering large amounts
   of bandwidth to a highly distributed access node topology.

   In this evolution path towards Giga Ethernet, there is in parallel a
   growing interest in migrating from the traditional PPP access model
   to one relying on an network access control of IP sessions
   establishment.  The "IP Sessions" model is a concept introduced in
   DSL Forum that covers a cycle consisting of IP session Detection and
   creation, application of IP session policies, and IP session
   termination.  Details of this work are documented in [WT146].
   Basically, an IP session represents subscriber IP traffic which is
   associated with a subscriber's IP address parameters.  A subscriber
   may have multiple IP addresses (or sessions) in simultaneous use.  An
   IP session may in turn be associated with multiple IP flows.  The
   relation between subscribers and policies associated with it are
   described in [WT134].  The policy relationships in this document show
   that subscribers have services that are governed by policies.  Thus,
   the same subscriber policies govern all IP sessions/flows belonging
   to the subscriber.

5.2.  Advisability of Introducing PANA in DSL Environment

   Among other challenges for DSL environment migrating from pure PPP
   based networks, one is the need for the creation of an IP session
   subscriber authentication model to secure network access and IP
   address management provided by a DHCP infrastructure.  Indeed,



Morand, et al.           Expires March 18, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks           September 2006


   contrary to PPP environment, an IP sessions model has no built-in
   mechanisms for authentication purposes in a DHCP based environment.
   Hence additional mechanisms are required to provide Network Access
   Providers (NAP) with an explicit access authentication solution.

   Providing a native support of EAP frames over IP, PANA is therefore a
   natural candidate to provide the protocol support of an IP subscriber
   authentication model.  Moreover, PANA provides functionalities
   fulfilling basic and advanced security requirements within an IP
   session based environment (as described in [WT146]) , such as:

   o  IP address based session management mechanisms, using an explicit
      session identifier;

   o  Authentication mechanism independent of the physical medium type;

   o  Per-session enforcement policies (i.e. filters) depending on the
      creation and deletion of the PANA session;

   o  Session keep-alive and session monitoring functionalities.


   In this new context for DSL networks, PANA may be introduced to
   authenticate the credentials of a user prior to the setup of an IP
   session.  The user selects the service provider and authenticates
   itself.  During IP session setup, policies for the use of connection
   resources related to the IP session are established in the BRAS.
   These policies govern the subscriber's use of network resources.  IP
   flows are accounted for and associated with the IP session and the
   service session that triggered it.

   Some examples to illustrate use cases for PANA in the DSL IP Session
   model are given below:

   o  A user has an intelligent terminal (e.g. smart phone) that is able
      to provide both voice and data services.  In this case, the user
      has subscribed two services e.g.  VoIP and Internet.  Following a
      PANA authentication, an IP session is created based on the single
      IP address allocated to the terminal.  However it is possible to
      distinguish two distinct IP flows within the same IP session, one
      for each service, and the accounting policy may be different for
      theses two flows.  The service provider is therefore able to
      associate the accounting records to each flow within the same IP
      session in order to bill the two services according to the
      subscribed rates.

   o  A user has subscribed to two services in addition to Internet
      access e.g.  VoIP and IP TV.  Each of these services has a

Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks           September 2006


      dedicated host associated with it.  The hosts authenticate on
      behalf of the subscriber.  After successful multiple PANA
      authentications (one per host), a distinct IP address is allocated
      to each of these hosts.  Thus, there are at this point three IP
      sessions related to the same IP subscriber.  The VoIP and IP TV
      flows may be provided a differentiated level of quality.
      Corresponding accounting records and their association with the
      service sessions need to be maintained for billing and settlement.

   o  A user starts a session in one network, authenticates using PANA
      and starts using a network service.  At some point in time, the
      user moves to another network (i.e., continues the session in
      another network).  In this case, there are two IP sessions (that
      results subsequent to PANA authentication in first network, and
      PANA authentication in second network) used during the course of
      the same service session.  Accounting (in the service provider)
      should be able to associate the flows related to the two IP
      sessions (from different networks) with the same service session.


6.  Applicability of PANA to IP Session based DSL Environment

6.1.  Functional Architecture

6.1.1.  Location of PAA and EP

   In a PPP based environment, the BRAS is in charge of interfacing with
   CPE for authenticating and authorizing them for the network access
   service as well as performing policy control by acting as en
   enforcement point.  In an IP session based environment, such
   functionalities may be provided at the same level by locating the PAA
   and EP entities in the BRAS.  One advantage provided by this
   implementation is to preserve a improved and well-established DSL
   network configuration.  Moreover, PAA and EP being collocated, there
   is no need to rely on an external interface between them to carry the
   authorized client attributes i.e. filters, an API being sufficient in
   that case.  However, it is possible to have PAA and BRAS/EP not
   collocated, as described in [I-D.ietf-pana-framework].  In that
   specific case, a PAA-BRAS interface may be based on SNMP (see
   [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp]) or on the future ANCP protocol (see charter of
   the ANCP IETF Working Group [www.ietf.org/html.charters/
   ancp-charter.html]).

   In such a configuration, the PAA will have to verify the credentials
   provided by a PaC located in the CPN and authorize network access to
   the host associated with the client and identified by a Device
   Identifier (DI).

Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks           September 2006


   As described in [WT146], the subscriber IP address is the main mean
   of classifying and managing an IP subscriber session.  Therefore,
   despite the fact that a link-layer identifier (e.g.  MAC address) may
   be used in some cases, the subscriber IP address will have to be the
   Device Identifier (DI) used in PANA by PAA/EP as a handle to control
   and police the network access.

   The host in CPN that can be authenticated by the PAA, and therefore
   where the PaC should be implemented, will be determined by the
   operation mode of the DSL Modem/RG, which may act as either a Layer-2
   Ethernet bridge (Bridged Mode) or a Layer-3 IP router (Routed Mode).

6.1.2.  Location of the PaC

6.1.2.1.  Bridged Mode

   In the Bridged mode, the DSL Modem/RG acts as a simple link-layer
   bridge.  The DSL Modem/RG is here transparent at the IP layer.  The
   hosts (e.g.  PC) connected to the DSL Modem/RG in the CPN and the
   BRAS are then on the same IP link.  Hosts may have a statically
   configured IP address or obtain an IP address from a DHCP server
   through the DSLAM (acting as a DHCP-Relay agent) and the BRAS
   (filtering DHCP requests towards the DHCP server).

   In this model, the PaC can be easily implemented in the hosts.  Any
   host connected to the DSL Modem/RG will be authenticated by the PAA
   locating in the BRAS.  It is therefore possible to perform a network
   access control on a per-host basis, as required by the IP session
   model.

                              Figure 3: Bridged Mode

6.1.2.2.  Routed Mode

   In the Routed mode, the DSL Modem/RG acts as an IP router for the
   CPN.  In this configuration, only the DSL Modem/RG and BRAS are on
   the same IP link.  The DSL Modem/RG may have a statically configured
   IP address or obtain an IP address from a DHCP server through the
   DSLAM (acting as a DHCP-Relay agent) and the BRAS (filtering DHCP
   requests towards the DHCP server).  Hosts connected to the DSL
   Modem/RG may use either (1) either private IP addresses in an IPv4
   environment with the DSL Modem/RG implemented a Network Address Port

   Translation (NAPT) function or (2) routable IP addresses if the modem
   is an IPv6 router.

   In the IPv4 context (1), the simplest method is to implement the PaC
   in the DSL Modem/RG.  Only the DSL Modem/RG will be authenticated/
   authorized by the PAA.  All hosts at the customer premises will then
   have access to the service provider's network using private IP
   addresses obtained from the DSL Modem/RG.

   (NOTE: Per-host authentication may be achieve also in the Routed mode
   if the EP function is performed by the DSL Modem/RG.  However it is
   for further studies to see how to introduce such a configuration in
   the global DSL Forum "IP Sessions" model.)

   In the IPv6 case (2), the BRAS will detect any new IP address used by
   the DSL Modem/RG and the hosts connected to the DSL Modem/RG if they
   use an non-local IP address.  To allow a suitable network access
   rights management based on the IP address, PANA clients will have to
   be therefore implemented in the DSL Modem/RG and the hosts.  As in
   the Bridged Mode, the network access control is also performed on a
   per-host basis, in addition to the handling of the DSL Modem/RG 's
   own IP sessions.

6.2.  IP Address Configuration

   As described in [I-D.ietf-pana-framework], the PaC MUST obtain an IP
   address prior to performing PANA-based authentication, called pre-
   PANA address (PRPA).

   In the context of PANA deployment in DSL environment based on the IP
   Sessions model, the PRPA MAY be configured by the following methods:

Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks           September 2006


   1.  The PaC MAY be statically configured with an IP address.  This
       address is therefore used as a PRPA.

   2.  The PaC MAY dynamically configure the PRPA using DHCPv4 [RFC2131]
       or DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   3.  In IPv6, the PaC MAY also configure non-link-local address(es)
       using IPv6 stateless auto-configuration [RFC2461] if router

   (NOTE: PANA supports also hosts using IPv4 link-local addresses
   [RFC3927] as PRPA.  However, at this time, it is not clear if such IP
   address configuration is supported in the DSL Forum "IP Sessions"
   model.)

   After a successful authentication, the PaC MAY have to configure a
   new IP address for communication with other nodes if the PRPA is a
   local-use (e.g., a link-local or private address) or a temporarily
   allocated IP address.  This IP address is called a post-PANA address
   (POPA).  An operator might choose allocating a POPA only after
   successful PANA authorization either to prevent waste of premium
   (e.g., globally routable) IP resources until the PaC is authorized
   (especially in the IPv4 case), or to enable PaC identity based
   address assignment.  POPA can be configured using DHCP [RFC2131]
   [RFC3315] or using IPv6 stateless auto-configuration [RFC2461].

   See Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] for further details on IP
   address configuration.

6.3.  PANA and Dynamic ISP Selection

   In some installations, a BRAS is shared by multiple service
   providers.  Each service provider configures the BRAS with a specific
   IP address space.

   The hosts at the customer premises network indicate their choice of
   service provider and the BRAS chooses the IP address from the
   appropriate service provider's pool.  In many cases, the address is
   assigned not by the BRAS but by the AAA server that is managed fully
   by the service provider.

   This simplifies the management of the DSL access network as it is not
   always necessary to configure each DSL access line with the service
   provider's identity.  The service provider is chosen dynamically by
   the DSL Modem/RG.  This is typically known as "dynamic Internet
   Service Provider selection".  The AAA function is usually overloaded
   to perform dynamic ISP selection.

6.3.1.  Selection as Part of the DHCP protocol or an Attribute of DSL
        Access Line

   The ISP selection, therefore the IP address pool, can be conveyed
   based on the DHCP protocol exchange using, e.g., the 'client-id'
   field of a DHCP packet, or by associating the DSL access line to the
   service provider before the PANA authentication begins.  When any of
   these schemes is used, the IP address used during PANA authentication
   (PRPA) is the ultimate IP address and it does not have to be changed
   upon successful authorization.

6.3.2.  Selection as Part of the PANA Authentication

   The ISP selection of the client can be explicitly conveyed during the
   PANA authentication (see "Network Selection" in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana]).  In that case, the client can be assigned a
   temporary IP address (PRPA) prior to PANA authentication.  This IP
   address might be obtained via DHCP with a lease reasonably long to
   complete PANA authentication, or via stateless auto-configuration.
   In either case, successful PANA authentication signalling prompts the
   client to obtain a new (long term) IP address via DHCP.  This new IP
   address (POPA) replaces the previously allocated temporary IP
   address.

6.4.  Cryptographic Protection

   DSL networks are protected by physical means.  Eavesdropping and
   spoofing attacks are prevented by keeping the unintended users
   physically away from the network media.  Therefore, generally
   cryptographic protection of data traffic is not common.
   Nevertheless, if enhanced security is deemed necessary for any
   reason, IPsec-based access control can be enabled on DSL networks as
   well by using the method described in [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].

6.5.  Example of Basic Flows

   The following flows are provided for illustration.  In the proposed
   use case, PANA clients are implemented in hosts connected to a DSL
   Modem/RG acting as an Ethernet bridge (which is therefore transparent
   at the IP layer).  IP addresses are configured using DHCP.  DSL
   network operator allocates temporary IP addresses (e.g. private IPv4
   addresses) until hosts are authenticated.  After a successful
   authentication, hosts have to configure a new IP address for
   communication with other nodes.

      The host performs a DHCP procedure to configure an IP address that
      will be used as PRPA.

      After configuration of the IP address, a PANA authentication
      procedure is performed between the host and the BRAS, that
      involves here a remote authentication server .  This phase may be
      initiated either by the host or the BRAS detecting the use of the

      PRPA.  For further details, see [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

      Following a successful authentication/authorization, the
      Authentication server passes any relevant service parameters for
      this subscriber IP session.

      The BRAS authorizes therefore the creation of the PANA session and
      creates an IP Session context for that subscriber.  The user
      service policy is applied to the IP session.

      As a temporary IP address was used as PRPA, the host performs a
      new DHCP procedure to configure a permanent IP address (aka POPA).

      When configured, the PaC notifies the PAA about the change of
      address and the BRAS updates the IP Session context with this new
      IP address.  For further details, see [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

      The BRAS should start accounting at this stage (using for instance
      Accounting Request (ACR) START and Accounting Answer (ACA) over a
      Diameter interface with a remote accounting server).

      When the user disconnects (L2 indication) or if there is an
      explicit PANA session termination request, the IP Session is
      terminated and accounting of the IP Session is stopped.


7.  Security Considerations

   The DSL infrastructure that connects the CPE to the DSLAM/BRAS is
   assumed to run over a physically-secured non-shared media.  For that
   reason, neither the use of a key-generating EAP method nor a secure
   L2/L3 channel bootstrapped by PANA is required.  The current DSL
   deployments are satisfied by using non-key-generating client-only
   authentication methods (e.g., CHAP and its EAP equivalent EAP-MD5).
   The same model can be maintained even with the PANA-based
   deployments.  If next generation deployments prefer key-generating
   mutual authentication methods, they can be naturally used with PANA
   too.
