Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and interpretations       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document provides suggested use cases, direction and
   interpretations for organisations and relying parties when creating
   or encountering RPKI object scenarios in the public RPKI in relation
   to the Internet routing system.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "A Profile
   for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates" [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs]
   "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "A
   Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format], "A Profile for Bogon Origin
   Authorizations (BOAs)" [I-D.ietf-sidr-bogons], "Validation of Route
   Origination in BGP using the Resource Certificate PKI"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation],

1.2.  Definitions

   The following definitions are in use in this document.

   Autonomous System (AS) Number (ASN) - An officially registered number
   reprsenting a common, clearly defined routing policy for use in
   Internet routing systems.

   Prefix - A network address and the prefix length.

   Route - A tuple of prefix and Autonomous System Number announced to
   Internet routing systems.

   Origin AS - The Autonomous System, designated by number, which
   originates a route.

   Aggregate - The result of where multiple specific prefixes are
   aggregated into one covering route.

   More specific - A route that has a longer prefix than a covering
   aggregate.

   Multi-homed - An Autonomous System that has active connections to
   more than one other Autonomous System

   Resource - An Internet (IP) addresses or Autonomous System Number.

   Sub-allocation - Where a holder of a resource further allocates a

   portion of the resource to another entity or organisation.

   Allocation - The set of resources allocated to an entity or
   organisation.

   Transit Provider - An Autonomous System that provides access to other
   networks through itself.

   Upstream - See "Transit Provider".

   Grandchild - A Sub-allocation that has resulted from one or more
   previous Sub-allocations.

   Parent - An allocation from which the subject prefix was sub-
   allocated.

   Grandparent - The allocation from which the prefix is a grandchild.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Overview

2.1.  General interpretation of RPKI object semantics

   It is important that the interpretation of relying parties, or
   relying party routing software, that implements a level of routing
   decision, when a routing update ("route") is received in light of the
   existence or non-existence of a corresponding RPKI object a 'make
   before break' stance is taken.  This means that the relying party
   should do all possible steps to ensure a route is valid, before
   attempting to declare it otherwise.  For all of the cases in this
   document it is assumed that RPKI objects validate (or otherwise) in
   accordance with [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs], [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch],
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation], and [I-D.ietf-sidr-bogons] unless
   otherwise stated.

   While many of the examples provided here demonstrate organisations
   with their own autonomous system numbers, it should be recognised
   that a prefix holder not necessarily be the holder of an autonomous
   system number, but simply use the autonomous system number for the
   purposes of origination.

3.  Origination use cases

3.1.  Single announcement

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   192.168.2.0/24, it wishes to announce the /24 prefix from ASN 64496
   to the Internet routing system such that relying parties interpret
   the route as valid.

   The resulting valid announcement (and organisation) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organisation |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 192.168.2.0/24  | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.2.  Aggregate with a more specific

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it wishes to announce the more specific prefix
   10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496 as well as the aggregate route to the
   Internet routing system such that relying parties interpret the
   routes as valid.

   The resulting valid announcements (and organisation) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organisation |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.3.  Aggregate with more specific from different ASN

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496 and ASN 64499) has been
   allocated the prefix 10.1.0.0/16, it wishes to announce the more
   specific prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64499 as well as the aggregate
   route from ASN 64496 to the Internet routing system such that relying
   parties interpret the routes as valid.

   The resulting valid announcements (and organisation) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64499     |  Org A      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.4.  Sub-allocation to multi-homed customer

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it wishes to announce the more specific prefix
   10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496.  It has further delegated 10.1.16.0/20 to
   a customer (Org B with ASN 64511) who is multi-homed and will
   originate the route prefix route from ASN 64511.  ASN 64496 will also
   announce the aggregate route to the Internet routing system such that
   relying parties interpret the routes as valid.

   The resulting valid announcements (and organisation) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organisation |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.16.0/20    | AS64511     |  Org B      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing parties would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.5.  Restriction of new allocation

   An organisation has recently been allocated the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.
   Its network deployment is not yet ready to announce the prefix and
   wishes to restrict all possible announcements of 10.1.0.0/16 and more
   specifics in routing using RPKI.

   The following announcements would be considered invalid:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organisation |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.6.  Restriction of new ASN

   An organisation has recently been allocated an additional 4 byte ASN
   65551.  Its network deployment is not yet ready to use this ASN and
   wishes to restrict all possible uses of ASN 65551 using RPKI.

   The following announcements would be considered invalid:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organisation |

      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.7.  Restriction of part of allocation

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  Its network topology permits the announcement of
   10.1.0.0/17 and the /16 aggregate however it wishes to restrict any
   possible announcement of 10.1.128.0/17 or more specifics of that /17
   using RPKI.

   The resulting valid announcements would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organisation |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |

3.8.  Restriction of prefix length

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it wishes to announce the aggregate and any or all more
   specific prefixes up to and including a maximum length of /20, but
   never any more specific than a /20.

   Examples of the resulting valid announcements (and organisation)
   would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organisation |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/17     | AS64496     |  Org A      |

      |     ...         | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.128.0/24   | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.9.  Restriction of sub-allocation prefix length

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it sub-allocates several /20 prefixes to its multi-homed
   customers Org B with ASN 65551, and Org C with ASN 64499.  It wishes
   to restrict those customers from advertising any corresponding routes
   more specific than a /22.

   The resulting valid announcements would be:

3.11.  Rogue Aggregation and origination by an upstream

   Consider four organisations with the following resources which were
   acquired independently from any transit provider.

      | Org D            | AS64512 |  10.1.2.0/24       |
      +-------------------------------------------------+

   These organisations share a common upstream provider Transit A (ASN
   64497) that originates an aggregate of these prefixes where possible.
   Org B (ASN 65551, 10.1.3.0/24) does not wish for its prefix to be

4.  Adjacency use cases

   Issues regarding validation of adjacency, or path validation, are
   currently out of scope of the SIDR-WG charter.  The use cases is this
   section are listed here as a reminder that the work goes beyond
   origination and at the stage when origination has been addressed by
   the WG, a re-charter to encompass adjacency will allow consideration
   of these use cases.

4.1.  Multi-homed

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  Its upstreams transit providers are Transit A with ASN
   65551 and Transit B ASN 64499.  The organisation announces the /16
   aggregate.  It permits that ASN 65551 and ASN 64499 may further pass
   on the aggregate route to their peers or upstreams.

   The following announcements and paths would be considered valid:

      +---------------------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |    Path                 |

      +---------------------------------------------------------+

   The issuing parties would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

4.2.  Restricting peers

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  Its two upstreams are Transit A with ASN 65551 and
   Transit B with ASN 64499.  The organisation (ASN 64496) peers with a
   third AS, Peer A with ASN 64511.  Org A announces the more specific
   10.1.0.0/24 and the /16 aggregate.  It wishes that only ASNs 65551
   and 64499 may announce the aggregate and more specifics to their
   upstreams.  ASN 64511, the peer, may not further announce (pass on,
   or leak) any routes for 10.1.0.0/16 and 10.1.0.0/24.

5.  Partial Deployment use cases

5.1.  Parent does not do RPKI

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64511) is multi-homed has been
   assigned the prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from its upstream (Transit A with ASN
   64496) Org A wishes to announce the prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64511
   to its other upstream(s).  Org A also wishes to create RPKI
   statements about the resource, however Transit A (ASN 64496) which
   announces the aggregate 10.1.0.0/16 has not yet adopted RPKI.

   The resulting valid announcements (and organisation with RPKI
   adoption) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organisation | RPKI |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64511     |  Org A      | Yes  |
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Transit A  | No   |

5.2.  Only some children participate

   An organisation (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16 and participates in RPKI, it wishes to announce the more
   specific prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496.  It has further delegated
   10.1.16.0/20 and 10.1.32.0/20 to customers Org B with ASN 64511 and
   and Org C with ASN 65551 (respectively) who are multi-homed.  Org B
   (ASN 64511) does not participate in RPKI.  Org C (ASN 65551)
   participates in RPKI.

   The resulting valid announcements (and organisation with RPKI
   adoption) would be:

5.3.  Grandchild allocations

   Consider the previous example with an extension by where Org B, who
   does not participate in RPKI, further allocates 10.1.17.0/24 to Org X
   with ASN 64512.

6.  Transfer use cases

6.1.  Transfer of in-use prefix and autonomous system number

   Organisation A holds the resource 10.1.0.0/20 and is currently is use
   and originated from AS64496 with valid RPKI objects in place.
   Organisation B has acquired these resources and desires an RPKI
   transfer on a particular date and time without adversely affecting
   the operational use of the resource.

   The following RPKI objects would be created/revoked: TBC

6.2.  Transfer of in-use prefix

   Organisation A holds the resource 10.1.0.0/8 and it is currently is
   use and originated from AS64496 with valid RPKI objects in place.
   Organisation B has acquired this resource and desires an RPKI
   transfer on a particular date and time with the additional change of
   originating the prefix from AS65551.

   The following RPKI objects would be created/revoked: TBC

6.3.  Transfer of un-used prefix

   Organisation A holds the resource 10.1.0.0/8 (with RPKI objects).
   Organisation B has acquired an unused portion of the resource
   (10.1.4.0/24) and desires an RPKI transfer on a particular date and

7.  Relying Party use cases

7.1.  Use Cases Related to ROA Expiry or receipt of a CRL covering a ROA

   Note: In the cases which follow the terms "expired ROA" or "revoked
   ROA" are shorthand, and describe the appropriate revocation or expiry
   of EE or Resource Certificates which result in the RPKI invalidation
   of a ROA.

7.1.1.  ROA of Parent Prefix is Revoked

   A revocation certificate list (CRL) is received which reveals that
   the ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496
   is revoked.  Further, a prefix route exists in the Internet routing
   system for 10.1.4.0/24 originated from ASN64496.

   Note: Parent prefix here simply means a less specific prefix.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.2.  ROA of Prefix Revoked

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   A Counter Example: If there was a valid ROA containing the (less
   specific) prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.3.  ROA of Grandparent Prefix Revoked while that of Parent Prefix
        Prevails

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: ROA for less specific grandparent prefix 10.1.0.0/16
   was withdrawn)

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.4.  ROA of Prefix Revoked while that of Parent Prefix Prevails

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: Perhaps the revocation of ROA for prefix 10.1.4.0/24
   was initiated just to eliminate redundancy)

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: ROA for less specific grandparent prefix 10.1.0.0/16
   expired.)

7.1.8.  Expiry of ROA of Prefix while ROA of Parent Prefix Prevails
