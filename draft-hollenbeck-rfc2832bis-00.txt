Abstract

  This document updates version 1.1.0 of the NSI Registry Registrar
  Protocol specified in RFC 2832.  The changes described in this
  document combined with the base specification documented in RFC 2832
  specify version 2.0.0 of the VeriSign Registry Registrar Protocol.

Conventions Used In This Document

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1. Introduction

  The Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP)
  was developed by NSI in 1998 and 1999 to allow multiple registrars to
  provide second level Internet domain name registration services in the
  top level domains (TLDs) administered by the NSI TLD registry.
  Version 1.1.0 of the NSI RRP was published as Informational RFC 2832
  [RFC2832] in May 2000.  This document describes changes to RFC 2832
  that specify version 2.0.0 of the protocol.

  NSI was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. in June 2000.  The protocol name
  change from "NSI RRP" to "VeriSign RRP" is a reflection of that
  acquisition.

2. Protocol Updates

  This specification describes three modifications to [RFC2832]: a new
  error response code is defined, domain TRANSFER command processing is
  updated to allow a client to cancel a requested domain transfer, and
  support for IPv6 name server addresses is added.

2.1 Response Code Update

  Section 5.1 of [RFC2832] is updated to include an additional error
  response code:

  557 Name server locked

  This response indicates that a name server has been locked by the
  registry.  A name server cannot be modified or deleted while it is
  locked.

  Section 5.2 of [RFC2832] is updated to include the addition of
  response code 557 to the possible error values returned from the DEL
  and MOD commands:

  Command: DEL
  Success: 200, 220
  Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 520, 531, 532,
  533, 541, 544, 545, 547, 549, 551, 552, 553, 557

  Command: MOD
  Success: 200, 220
  Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 520, 531, 535,
  540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 557

2.2 TRANSFER Command Update

  Section 4.3.10 of [RFC2832] is updated to include an additional
  TRANSFER command processing option.

  Old text:

  Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
  request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting
  registrar.  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name may
  explicitly approve or reject a requested transfer.  The registry MAY
  implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed amount
  of time.


  New text:

  Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
  request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting
  registrar.  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name may
  explicitly approve a requested transfer.  The current sponsoring
  registrar MAY explicitly reject a requested transfer. The registry MAY
  implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed amount
  of time.  The requesting registrar MAY cancel a pending request, but
  the request to cancel the transfer MUST be sent before it has been
  explicitly approved or rejected by the current sponsoring registrar or
  it has been implicitly approved or rejected by the registry.

  Example:

  A registrar cancels a previously requested domain transfer:

  C:transfer<crlf>
  C:-Approve:No<crlf>
  C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
  C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
  C:.<crlf>
  S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
  S:.<crlf>

2.3 Name Server IP Address Update

  Section 7 of [RFC2832] is updated to include support for name servers
  using IPv6 addresses.  IPv6 addressing architecture is described in
  [IPv6].  This ABNF grammar supplements the grammar defined in RFC
  2832.

  ; Lexical Tokens

  hexdigit = digit / %X41-46 / %x61-66   ; 0-9 / A-F / a-f

  doubleoctet = 1*4hexdigit

  docolon = doubleoctet colon

  colondo = colon doubleoctet

  ip-address =  ip-address-v4 / ip-address-v6

  ; ipv4 addresses
  ip-address-v4 = 1*3digit dot 1*3digit dot 1*3digit dot 1*3digit

  ip-address-v6 =  ip-address-v6-standard / ip-address-v6-compressed

  ; Standard form of IPv6 addresses
  ; 8 hexdigit strings of length 1-4 separated by colons
  ;
  ; Eg: 10AA:0:0:00:8:800:200C:417A

  ip-address-v6-standard = doubleoctet 7colondo

  ; Compressed form of IPv6 addresses
  ; Runs of zero-value octets are represented by '::'
  ;
  ; Eg:
  ;       ::                        ==> 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
  ;
  ;       1::                       ==> 1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
  ;       2:2::                     ==> 2:2:0:0:0:0:0:0
  ;       7:7:7:7:7:7:7::           ==> 7:7:7:7:7:7:7:0
  ;
  ;       ::1                       ==> 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
  ;       ::2:2                     ==> 0:0:0:0:0:0:2:2
  ;       ::7:7:7:7:7:7:7           ==> 0:7:7:7:7:7:7:7
  ;
  ;       E::1                      ==> E:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
  ;       E::2:2                    ==> E:0:0:0:0:0:2:2
  ;       E::6:6:6:6:6:6            ==> E:0:6:6:6:6:6:6
