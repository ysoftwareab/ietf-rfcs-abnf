1.  Introduction

   It might be desirable to create a PIM interface between routers where
   only PIM Join/Prunes and Asserts packets are triggered over it
   without having a full PIM neighbor discovery.  As an example, this
   type of PIM interface can be useful in some scenarios where the
   multicast state needs to be signaled over a network or medium which
   is not capable of creating full PIM neighborship between its Peer
   Routers.  These type of PIM interfaces are called PIM Light
   Interfaces (PLI).

3.  PIM Light Interface

   RFC [RFC7761] section 4.3.1 describes the PIM nighbor discovery via
   Hello messages.  It also describes that PIM Join/Prune or Assert
   messages are not accepted from a router unless a Hello message has
   been heard from that router.

   In some scenarios it is desired to build a multicast state between
   two directly attach or remote routers without establishing a PIM
   neighborship.  There could be many reasons for this desired, but one
   example is the desired to signal multicast states upstream between
   two PIM Domains via a network or medium that is not optimized for PIM
   Neighbor establishment.  A BIER network is an example of this, where
   the BIER network is connecting two PIM domains as per
   [draft-hfa-bier-pim-signaling] and the multicast states from the
   hosts to the source are signaled via two edge PIM networks through
   the BIER domain.

   A PIM Light Interface (PLI) does accept Join/Prune and Assert
   messages from a unknown PIM router, without receiving a PIM Hello
   message form other routers.  Lack of Hello Messages on a PLI means
   there is no mechanism to learn about the neighboring PIM routers on
   each interface and there is no DR Priority options communicated
   between Routers either.  As such the router doesn't create any
   General-Purpose state for neighboring PIM routers and it accepts and
   installs each Join message from upstream routers in its multicast
   routing table.

   Because of this a PLI needs to be created in very especial cases and
   the application that is using these PLIs should ensure there is no
   multicast duplication of packets.  As an example, multiple upstream
   routers sending the same multicast stream to a single downstream
   router.

   As an example, in a BIER domain which is connecting 2 PIM networks.
   A PLI can be established between two edge BIER routers and only
   multicast states communicated via PIM Join/prunes over the BIER
   domain.  In this case to ensure there is no multicast stream
   duplication the PIM routers attached on each side of the BIER domain
   might want to establish PIM Adjacency via [RFC7761] to ensure DR
   selection on the edge of the BIER router and PLI is used in core of
   the BIER Domain.

3.1.  PLI Configuration

   Since a PLI doesn't support PIM Hello Messages to discover other PIM
   routers, for security reasons, there needs to be a mechanism to
   enable PLI on an interface or the router.  This can be achieved via
   different methods and is implementation specific.  As an example:

   *  For Point to Point interface PLI can be enabled on an interface
      that is accepting the PIM Join/Prune or Assert messages only.

   *  A PLI can also be configured on a logical interface or a tunnel
      interface, like a MPLS tunnel or a GRE tunnel to accept PIM Join/
      Prune or Assert messages.

   *  In some cases it is not possible to configure a PLI between two
      routers, as an example in a BIER network where multicast states
      are communicated via PIM Join/Prunes.  As per
      [draft-hfa-bier-pim-signaling] there can be multiple BIER Edge
      routers that can signal their desire for a multicast state.  In
      these scenarios the router needs to be configured to support PLI
      and only accept PIM Join/Prune or Assert messages based on this
      global configuration

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value (TBD) to the BIER Information
   Vector PIM Join Attribute from the PIM Join Attribute Types registry.
