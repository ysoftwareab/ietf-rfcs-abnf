Internet-Draft                   6LoPLC                       March 20141.  Introduction   6LOWPAN technology defines the transport of IPv6 packets over IEEE   802.15.4-2006 low power and lossy networks (LLNs). Because the   802.15.4-2006 wireless links do not support the IPv6 requirement for   a link MTU of at least 1280 octets, 6LOWPAN adaptation layer defines   header compression and fragmentation of IPv6 packets.   A link in a LLN is characterized as lossy, low-power, low bit-rate,   and short range.  The LLN nodes have resources constrained in terms   of processing power, memory capabilities, and communication   bandwidth, due to a combination of factors including regulations on   spectrum use, form factor and cost considerations.   Recently, IEEE Standard Association published the IEEE 1901.2 PHY and   MAC standard for narrowband powerline communications (NB-PLC). When   used in LLNs, apart from using powerline communications instead of   wireless communications, the devices implementing IEEE 1901.2   standard share the same constraints as their wireless counterparts.1.1.  Applicability   This document updates [RFC4944] and [RFC6282] and specifies 6LoPLC:   the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 1901.2 NB-PLC networks.   The term 6LoPLC is used to make a clear difference between the   6LOWPAN technology, known in the industry as a mechanism to transmit   IPv6 packets over 802.15.4-2006 wireless networks, and the use of   6LOWPAN technology for the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE   1901.2 networks.   This document specifies a set of behaviors between devices in 1901.2   networks, which apply to both mesh and star topologies.  An   implementation that adheres to this document MUST implement these   behaviors.1.2.  IEEE 1901.2 Technology   This section describes those features from IEEE 1901.2 standard that   are relevant to the transmission of IPv6 packets over 1901.2   networks.  For further details on IEEE 1901.2 technology, the reader   is invited to refer to [IEEE1901.2].   IEEE 1901.2 standard defines a Narrowband PLC PHY and MAC technology   for indoor and outdoor communications (e.g., smart grid networks,   home area networks).   IEEE 1901.2 MAC frame format endorses the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC   frame format [IEEE802.15.4], with a few exceptions described below.Popa & Hui             Expires September 30, 2014               [Page 2]
Internet-Draft                   6LoPLC                       March 2014   o  The IEEE 1901.2 MAC frame format is obtained by prepending a      Segment Control Field to the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC frame.  One      function of the Segment Control Field is to carry inline      information for the MAC sub-layer fragmentation and reassembly      process.  Note that the complete format and use of Segment Control      Field are not relevant to the transmission of IPv6 packets over      IEEE 1901.2 networks.   o  IEEE 1901.2 MAC frame format endorses only the IEEE 802.15.4-2006      short and extended MAC addresses with a length of 16 and 64 bits,      respectively.   o  IEEE 1901.2 MAC frame format endorses the concept of Information      Elements, as defined in IEEE 802.15.4e-2012 [IEEE802.15.4e].  Note      that the format and use of Information Elements are not relevant      to the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 1901.2 networks.   The maximum size of a 1901.2 MAC frame payload is 1280 bytes, while   the maximum size of a 1901.2 PHY frame payload is 512 bytes.  The PHY   frame payload size can vary from frame to frame, as a function of the   modulation used to transmit the frame and the strength of the Forward   Error Correction scheme.   To cope with the mismatch between the size of the PHY frame payload   and the size of the MAC frame, the IEEE 1901.2 standard specifies a   mandatory MAC sub-layer fragmentation and reassembly process.  This   process fragments an upper layer datagram into multiple fragments and   provides a reliable one-hop transfer of the resulting fragments.2.  Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 1901.2 Networks   The transmission of IPv6 packets over low-power and lossy networks   relies on two mechanisms defined at 6LOWPAN adaptation layer.  The   first mechanism defines a set of procedures for IPv6 and UDP header   compression (as specified in [RFC4944] and updated in [RFC6282]).   The second mechanism defines a scheme for one-hop fragmentation and   reassembly of IPv6 packets (as specified in [RFC4944]).2.1.  6LOWPAN Header compression   Because IEEE 1901.2 fundamentally supports the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC   frame format and addressing scheme, IEEE 1901.2 devices implementing   this specification MUST support the 6LOWPAN header compression   schemes specified in [RFC6282].   Note that header compression mechanisms defined in [RFC6282]   completely replace the header compression mechanisms defined in   [RFC4944].2.2.  6LOWPAN FragmentationPopa & Hui             Expires September 30, 2014               [Page 3]
Internet-Draft                   6LoPLC                       March 2014   The use of fragmentation and reassembly consumes resources in terms   of buffering and processing power.  Also, fragmentation and   reassembly consumes link capacity because, for each fragment that is   transmitted, additional headers are required to properly manage the   transmission, retransmission and reassembly of the fragments.  As   such, in the context of LLNs, where HW resources are constrained and   network capacity is scarce, the fragmentation and reassembly should   be avoided whenever possible.   Because IEEE 1901.2 fundamentally supports a MAC payload of 1280   bytes and provides its own MAC sub-layer fragmentation mechanism, the   use of 6LOWPAN fragmentation scheme defined in [RFC4944], when   transmitting IPv6 packets over IEEE 1901.2 networks, is NOT   RECOMMENDED.3.  IANA Considerations   No IANA considerations.4.  Security Considerations   This document has no security considerations beyond those in   [RFC4291].5.
