                       draft-ietf-cbor-packed-02

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.  CBOR data
   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models often
   allow considerable gains in compactness when applying data
   compression.  While traditional data compression techniques such as
   DEFLATE (RFC 1951) work well for CBOR, their disadvantage is that the
   receiver needs to unpack the compressed form to make use of data.

   This specification describes Packed CBOR, a simple transformation of
   a CBOR data item into another CBOR data item that is almost as easy
   to consume as the original CBOR data item.  A separate decompression
   step is therefore often not required at the receiver.

Internet-Draft                 Packed CBOR                 February 2021


   The specification defines a transformation from a Packed CBOR data
   item to the original CBOR data item; it does not define an algorithm
   for an actual packer.  Different packers can differ in the amount of
   effort they invest in arriving at a minimal packed form.

   Packed CBOR can employ two kinds of optimization:

   *  item sharing: substructures (data items) that occur repeatedly in
      the original CBOR data item can be collapsed to a simple reference
      to a common representation of that data item.  The processing
      required during consumption is limited to following that
      reference.

   *  affix sharing: data items (strings, containers) that share a
      prefix or suffix (affix) can be replaced by a reference to a
      common affix plus the rest of the data item.  For strings, the
      processing required during consumption is similar to following the
      affix reference plus that for an indefinite-length string.

   A specific application protocol that employs Packed CBOR might allow
   both kinds of optimization or limit the representation to item
   sharing only.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Packed reference:  A shared item reference or an affix reference

   Shared item reference:  A reference to a shared item as defined in
      Section 2.2

   Affix reference:  A reference that combines an affix item as defined
      in Section 2.3.

   Affix:  Prefix or suffix.

   Packing tables:  The triple of a shared item table, a prefix table,
      and a suffix table.

   Expansion:  The result of applying a packed reference in the context
      of given Packing tables.

Internet-Draft                 Packed CBOR                 February 2021


   The definitions of [RFC8949] apply.  The term "byte" is used in its
   now customary sense as a synonym for "octet".  Where bit arithmetic
   is explained, this document uses the notation familiar from the
   programming language C (including C++14's 0bnnn binary literals),
   except that, in the plain text form of this document, the operator
   "^" stands for exponentiation.

2.  Packed CBOR

   Packed CBOR is defined in two parts: Referencing packing tables (this
   section) and setting up packing tables (Section 3).

2.1.  Packing Tables

   At any point within a data item making use of Packed CBOR, there is a
   Current Set of packing tables that applies.

   There are three packing tables in a Current Set:

   *  Shared item table

   *  Prefix table

   *  Suffix table

   Without any table setup, all these tables are empty arrays.
   Table setup can cause these arrays to be non-empty, where the
   elements are (potentially themselves packed) data items.  In the
   abstract, each of the tables is indexed by an unsigned integer
   (starting from 0).

2.2.  Referencing Shared Items

   Shared items are stored in the shared item table of the Current Set.

   The shared data items are referenced by using the reference data
   items in Table 1.  When reconstructing the original data item, such a
   reference is replaced by the referenced data item, which is then
   recursively unpacked.

               | Tag 6(unsigned integer N) | 16 + 2*N     |
               +---------------------------+--------------+
               | Tag 6(negative integer N) | 16 - 2*N - 1 |
               +---------------------------+--------------+

                    Table 1: Referencing Shared Values

   As examples in CBOR diagnostic notation (Section 8 of [RFC8949]), the
   first 22 elements of the shared item table are referenced by
   "simple(0)", "simple(1)", ... "simple(15)", "6(0)", "6(-1)", "6(1)",
   "6(-2)", "6(2)", "6(-3)".  (The alternation between unsigned and
   negative integers for even/odd table index values makes systematic
   use of shorter integer encodings first.)

   Taking into account the encoding of these referring data items, there
   are 16 one-byte references, 48 two-byte references, 512 three-byte
   references, 131072 four-byte references, etc.  As integers can grow
   to very large (or negative) values, there is no practical limit to
   how many shared items might be used in a Packed CBOR item.

   Note that the semantics of Tag 6 depend on its content: An integer
   turns the tag into a shared item reference, a string or container
   (map or array) into a prefix reference (see Table 2).

2.3.  Referencing Affix Items

   Prefix items are stored in the prefix table of the Current Set;
   suffix items are stored in the suffix table of the Current Set. We
   collectively call these items affix items; when referencing, which of
   the tables is actually used depends on whether a prefix or a suffix
   reference was used.

           +-----------------------------------+---------------+

                     Table 3: Referencing Suffix Values

   Affix data items are referenced by using the data items in Table 2
   and Table 3.  Each of these implies the table used (prefix or
   suffix), a table index (an unsigned integer) and contains a "rump
   item".  When reconstructing the original data item, such a reference
   is replaced by a data item constructed from the referenced affix data
   item (affix, which might need to be recursively unpacked first)
   "concatenated" with the tag content (rump, again possibly recursively
   unpacked).

   *  For a rump of type array and map, the affix also needs to be an
      array or a map.  For an array, the elements from the prefix are
      prepended, and the elements from a suffix are appended to the rump
      array.  For a map, the entries in the affix are added to those of
      the rump; prefix and suffix references differ in how entries with
      identical keys are combined: for prefix references, an entry in
      the rump with the same key as an entry in the affix overrides the
      one in the affix, while for suffix references, an entry in the
      affix overrides an entry in the rump that has the same key.

      |  ISSUE: Not sure that we want to use the efficiencies of
      |  overriding, but having default values supplied out of a
      |  dictionary to be overridden by a rump sounds rather handy.
      |  Note that there is no way to remove a map entry from the table.

   *  For a rump of one of the string types, the affix also needs to be
      one of the string types; the bytes of the strings are concatenated
      as specified (prefix + rump, rump + suffix).  The result of the
      concatenation gets the type of the rump; this way a single affix
      can be used to build both byte and text strings, depending on what
      type of rump is being used.

   As a contrived (but short) example, if the prefix table is
   "["foobar", "foob", "fo"]", the following prefix references will all
   unpack to ""foobart"": "6("t")", "224("art")", "225("obart")" (the
   last example isn't really an optimization).

   Taking into account the encoding, there is one single-byte prefix
   reference, 31 (2^(5)-2^(0)) two-byte references, 4064 (2^(12)-2^(5))
   three-byte references, and 26843160 (2^(28)-2^(12)) five-byte
   references for prefixes. 268435455 (2^(28)) is an artificial limit,
   but should be high enough that there, again, is no practical limit to
   how many prefix items might be used in a Packed CBOR item.  The
   numbers for suffix references are one quarter of those, except that
   there is no single-byte reference and 8 two-byte references.

      |  Rationale: Experience suggests that prefix packing might be
      |  more likely than suffix packing.  Also for this reason, there
      |  is no intent to spend a 1+0 tag value for suffix matching.

2.4.  Discussion

   This specification uses up a large number of Simple Values and Tags,
   in particular one of the rare one-byte tags and half of the one-byte
   simple values.  Since the objective is compression, this is warranted
   if and only if there is consensus that this specific format could be
   useful for a wide area of applications, while maintaining reasonable
   simplicity in particular at the side of the consumer.

   A maliciously crafted Packed CBOR data item might contain a reference
   loop.  A consumer/decompressor MUST protect against that.

   The current definition does nothing to help with packing CBOR
   sequences [RFC8742]; maybe it should.

3.  Table Setup

   The packing references described in Section 2 assume that packing
   tables have been set up.

   By default, all three tables are empty (zero-length arrays).

   Table setup can happen in one of two ways:

   *  By the application environment, e.g., a media type.  These can
      define tables that amount to a static dictionary that can be used
      in a CBOR data item for this application environment.

   *  By one or more tags enclosing the packed content.  These can be
      defined to add to the packing tables that already apply to the
      tag.  Usually, the semantics of the tag will be to prepend items
      to one of the tables.  Note that it may be useful to leave a
      particular efficiency tier alone and only prepend to a higher
      tier; e.g., a tag could insert shared items at table index 16 and
      shift anything that was already there further down in the array
      while leaving index 0 to 15 alone.  Explicit additions by tag can
      combine with application-environment supplied tables that apply to
      the entire CBOR data item.

   The present specification only defines a single tag for prepending to
   the (by default empty) tables.

      |  We could also define a tag for dictionary referencing (or
      |  include that in the basic packed CBOR), but the details are
      |  likely to vary considerably between applications.  A URI-based
      |  reference would be easy to add, but might be too inefficient
      |  when used in the likely combination with an "ni:" URI
      |  [RFC6920].

3.1.  Basic Packed CBOR

   A predefined tag for packing table setup is defined in CDDL [RFC8610]
   as in Figure 1:

   Basic-Packed-CBOR = #6.51([[*shared], [*prefix], [*suffix], rump])
   rump = any
   prefix = any
   suffix = any
   shared = any

                       Figure 1: Packed CBOR in CDDL

   (This assumes the allocation of tag number 51.)

Internet-Draft                 Packed CBOR                 February 2021


   The arrays given as the first, second, and third element of the
   content of the tag 51 are prepended to the tables for shared items,
   prefixes, and suffixes that apply to the entire tag (by default empty
   tables).

   The original CBOR data item can be reconstructed by recursively
   replacing shared, prefix, and suffix references encountered in the
   rump by their expansions.

4.  IANA Considerations

   In the registry [IANA.cbor-tags], IANA is requested to allocate the
   tags defined in Table 4.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8949] apply.

   Loops in the Packed CBOR can be used as a denial of service attack,
   see Section 2.4.

   As the unpacking is deterministic, packed forms can be used as
   signing inputs.  (Note that if external dictionaries are added to
   cbor-packed, this requires additional consideration.)

Appendix A.  Examples

   The (JSON-compatible) CBOR data structure depicted in Figure 2, 400
   bytes of binary CBOR, could lead to a packed CBOR data item depicted
   in Figure 3, ~309 bytes.  Note that this particular example does not
   lend itself to prefix compression.

Acknowledgements

   CBOR packing was originally invented with the rest of CBOR, but did
   not make it into [RFC7049], the predecessor of [RFC8949].  Various
   attempts to come up with a specification over the years didn't
   proceed.  In 2017, Sebastian K√§bisch proposed investigating compact
   representations of W3C Thing Descriptions, which prompted the author
   to come up with essentially the present design.
