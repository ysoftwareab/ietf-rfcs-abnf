Abstract

   This document defines the format and procedures for interchange of
   network news articles. It updates and obsoletes RFC 1036, in
   particular adding support for internationalization of headers and
   message bodies and multimedia support in message bodies.  It does
   this in a manner designed to maximize backward compatibility with
   mail and news servers, gateways, and user agents.

   Network news articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast to
   potentially-large audiences, using a flooding algorithm that
   propagates one copy to each interested host (or group thereof),
   typically stores only one copy per host, and does not require any
   central administration or systematic registration of interested

   users. Network news originated as the medium of communication for
   Usenet, circa 1980. Since then Usenet has grown explosively, and many
   Internet sites participate in it. In addition, the news technology is
   now in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet and
   elsewhere.

Internet-Draft            News Article Format              February 2003


1. Introduction

1.1 Scope

   "Netnews" is a set of protocols for generating, storing and
   retrieving news "articles" (which resemble email messages) and for
   exchanging them amongst a readership which is potentially widely
   distributed. It is organized around "newsgroups", with the
   expectation that each reader will be able to see all articles posted
   to each newsgroup in which she participates. These protocols most
   commonly use a flooding algorithm which propagates copies throughout
   a network of participating servers.  Typically, only one copy is
   stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to
   readers able to access that server.

   The predecessor to this document [RFC1036] said that: "In any
   situation where this standard conflicts with the Internet [email
   standard, the latter] should be considered correct and this standard
   in error." The basic philosophy of this document follows that
   previous convention, so as to standardize news article syntax firmly
   in the context of email syntax.  Further, this document uses a cite
   by reference methodology, rather than trying to repeat the contents
   of other standards, which could otherwise result in subtle
   differences and interoperability challenges.  Although this document
   is as a result rather short, it requires complete understanding and
   implementation of the normative references to be compliant.

   This document specifies only the syntax of compliant news articles. A
   companion document will be necessary to specify the policy
   requirements and recommendations of news agents, servers, and
   gateways.

1.2 Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3 Syntax notation

   Headers defined in this specification use the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation specified in [RFC2234] and many constructs
   defined in [RFC2822].

1.4 Structure of this document

   Section 2 defines the format of news articles. Section 3 defines some
   additional headers necessary for the netnews environment.

Internet-Draft            News Article Format              February 2003


2. Format

2.1 Base

   News articles MUST conform to the "legal to generate syntax"
   specified in Section 3 of [RFC2822], except for the different
   requirement of mandatory headers as specified in Section 3.1. News
   agents SHOULD also support the obsolete syntax specified in Section 4
   of [RFC2822], particularly to support old news messages and gatewayed
   obsolete mail messages, but they MUST NOT generate such syntax.

2.2 MIME Conformance

   News agents MUST meet the definition of MIME-conformance in
   [RFC2049].  Note that this requires support for [RFC2047]
   internationalization (i18n) of headers.  In addition, news agents
   MUST support the i18n extensions for parameters and language tagging
   specified in [RFC2231].

   Section 2.10 of [RFC2049] describes the display of encoded-words.
   This document adds an additional requirement that for encoded words
   using the UTF-8 charset, the news agent MUST at least be able to
   display the characters which are also in the US-ASCII charset.

   News agents conformant with this document MUST also support receipt
   (and automatic reassembly) of message/partial MIME messages, as
   specified in Section 5.2.2 of [RFC2046].  News agents SHOULD support
   generation of message/partial articles for excessively large
   articles.

   The one change from [RFC2047] is that while Section 3 of that
   document recommends that "members of the ISO-8859-* series be used in
   preference to other character sets", this document specifies that
   news agents SHOULD use UTF-8 as the charset for encoded words.  Among
   other things, this is conformant with the IETF recommendations of
   [RFC2277].

Internet-Draft            News Article Format              February 2003


3. Headers

3.1 Mandatory headers

   Each news article conformant with this specification MUST have
   exactly one of each of the following headers: Date, From, Message-ID,
   Subject, Newsgroups, and Path. The first 4 are specified in
   [RFC2822].

3.2 News headers

3.2.1 Newsgroups

   The Newsgroups header specifies which newsgroup(s) the article is
   posted to:

   newsgroups      =  "Newsgroups: " newsgroup-list CRLF

   newsgroup-list  =  newsgroup-name *( "," [FWS] newsgroup-name )

   newsgroup-name  =  component *( "." component ) ; 71 character max

   component       =  plain-component / encoded-comp

   plain-component =  component-start *29component-rest

   component-start =  lowercase / DIGIT

   lowercase       =  %x61-7A ;  a-z

   component-rest  =  component-start / "+" / "-" / "_"

   encoded-comp    =  ace-prefix 1*25ldh

   ace-prefix      =  "zz--"

   ldh             =  lowercase / DIGIT / "-"

   A newsgroup name consists of one or more components separated by
   periods, with no more than 71 characters total.  Each component
   consists of less than 30 lowercase letters and digits, or is an
   encoded component. The order of newsgroup names in the Newsgroups
   header is not significant.

3.2.1.1 Encoded components

   Encoding of i18n newsgroup names follows the general approach laid
   out in [IDNA]. Encoded components are strings of Unicode characters



Kohn                     Expires August 2, 2003                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            News Article Format              February 2003


   that have been normalized using [nameprep] and encoded using
   [punycode]. The main difference from [IDNA] is that this
   specification limits encoded components to 30 characters, not 63.
   With the 4 character ACE prefix, that means that the output of
   punycode is limited to 26 characters.

   This example encodes the newsgroup name that would be displayed as
   "test.3<nen>B<gumi><kinpachi><sensei>.misc", where the middle
   component consists of the Unicode string U+0033 U+5E74 U+0042 U+7D44
   U+91D1 U+516B U+5148 U+751F.  Punycode encodes that string as
   "3B-ww4c5e180e575a65lsy2b".  So, the resulting newsgroup name, which
   has been encoded so as to comply with this document, is
   "test.zz--3B-ww4c5e180e575a65lsy2b.misc".

3.2.2 Path

   The Path-header shows the route taken by a message since its entry
   into the Netnews system.

   path            =  "Path: " path-content CRLF

   path-content    =  [FWS] *( path-host [FWS] path-delimiter [FWS] )
                      tail-entry [FWS]

   path-host       =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
                      *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / ":" / "_" )

   path-delimiter  =  "/" / "?" / "%" / "," / "!"

   tail-entry      =  path-identity

3.2.3 Followup-To

   The Followup-To header specifies to which newsgroup(s) followups
   should be posted.

   followup-to     =  "Followup-To: " followup-value CRLF

   followup-value  =  newsgroups-list / poster-text

   poster-text     =  [FWS] %x70.6F.73.74.65.72 [FWS]
                      ; "poster" in lower-case

   The syntax is the same as that of the Newsgroups content, with the
   exception that the magic word "poster" means that followups should be
   mailed to the article's reply address rather than posted. In the
   absence of Followup-To, the default newsgroup(s) for a followup are
   those in the Newsgroups header.

Internet-Draft            News Article Format              February 2003


3.2.4 Expires

   The Expires header content specifies a date and time when the article
   is deemed to be no longer useful and should be removed ("expired").

   expires         =  "Expires: " date-time CRLF

   The content syntax is the same as that of the Date content. In the
   absence of Expires, the default is decided by the administrators of
   each host the article reaches, who MAY also restrict the extent to
   which the Expires header is honored.

3.3 Other headers

   Add info on References, Control, Distribution, Summary, Approved,
   Lines, Xref, Supercedes, Also-Control, See-Also, Article-Names, and
   Article-Updates.

4. Security Considerations

   The News Article Format specified in this document does not provide
   any security services, such as confidentiality, authentication of
   sender, or non-forgery.  Instead, such services need to be layered
   above, using such protocols as S/MIME [RFC2633] or PGP/MIME
   [RFC3156], or below, using secure versions of news transport
   protocols.  Additionally, several currently non-standardized
   protocols [PGPVERIFY] will hopefully be standardized in the near
   future.
