                 draft-raszuk-idr-bgp-auto-discovery-06

Abstract

   This document describes a method for automating portions of a
   router's BGP configuration via discovery of BGP peers with which to
   establish further sessions from an initial "bootstrap" router.  This
   method can apply for establishment of either Internal or External BGP
   peering sessions.

1.  History

   An idea for IBGP Auto Mesh [I-D.raszuk-idr-ibgp-auto-mesh] was
   originally presented at IETF 57.  The concept made use of an IGP
   (either ISIS or OSPF) for flooding BGP auto discovery information.
   In this proposal both auto-discovery/bootstrapping and propagation of
   BGP configuration parameters occur within the BGP4 protocol itself.

   The IGP based IBGP discovery mechanism presented was well fitted to
   the native IP switching, in which all nodes in the IGP need to
   participate in BGP mesh.  However, it also came with a number of
   drawbacks, some of which include the requirement for leaking between
   area boundaries or possible race conditions between disjoint flooding
   paths from which the information arrived.

   The BGP peer auto discovery mechanism described in this document was
   conceived initially in 2008 as a way to distribute peering session

   establishment information via BGP for IBGP applications which are
   only active on the edge of the network.  For example, these
   applications include BGP MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364], rt-constrain
   [RFC4684], flow-spec [RFC5575], or Multicast VPNs [RFC6513].  However
   the idea was not documented for the community to discuss further at
   that time.

   In 2011, another solution for BGP peer discovery that targeted EBGP
   peer discovery for Internet Exchange Point (IXP) participants was
   described in [I-D.wkumari-idr-socialite].  This idea was useful as a
   potential alternative solution for operators who wished to maintain
   individual peering sessions with other IXP participants, rather than
   receiving information through route-servers operated by the IXP
   operator without the associated administrative burden of configuring
   and maintaining sessions with all the other participants.  This draft
   distributed the participant sessions information utilizing a BGP
   capability code [RFC5492] that was ill-suited for updating the
   information after initial session establishment.

   This draft represents an attempt by the authors of both drafts to
   provide a solution that can be used in multiple IBGP or EBGP
   applications when the operator desires to automatically collect and
   distribute basic BGP session establishment information from a
   centralized BGP speaker.

2.  Introduction

   The base BGP-4 specification [RFC4271] utilizes TCP for session
   establishment between peers, which requires prior knowledge of the
   endpoint's address to which a BGP session should be targeted.  This
   endpoint in most deployments is configured manually by the operator
   at each end of pair of network elements.  In numerous applications,
   the list of all valid endpoints may be available centrally; however,
   the task of configuring or updating all of the network elements that
   require this information becomes a much larger task.

   The most typical application of this in most networks is the
   establishment of a full mesh of IBGP routers to distribute standard
   IPv4 and IPv6 unicast routing information, such as the Internet route
   table, within an Autonomous System (AS).  This was one of the reasons
   that lead to the introduction of BGP Route Reflection [RFC4456].  The
   most common benefits/drawbacks associated with route reflection are
   listed below:

   o  Configuration ease when adding or deleting new IBGP peers

   o  Reduction number of TCP sessions to be handled by ASBRs/PEs




Raszuk, et al.            Expires June 10, 2020                 [Page 3]

   o  Information reduction - best path propagation only

   o  Limitation for new applications that require more than best path
      propagation

   o  Route instabilities caused by information reduction (ex:
      oscillations) etc. ...

   Another application which requires prior knowledge of a large number
   of BGP endpoints is at Internet Exchange Points (IXP).  These
   networks are specifically built and operated as locations for
   different networks to peer and exchange traffic.  Multilateral
   Interconnection at an IXP
   [I-D.ietf-grow-ix-bgp-route-server-operations] is utilized to avoid
   having each participant at the IXP having to contact all of the other
   participants to enter into peering relationships, utilizing a Route
   Server (RS).  Some of the reasons why participants peer with route-
   servers at IXPs include:

   o  reducing the administrative burden of arranging and configuring
      BGP sessions with all the other participants

   o  not wanting (or being able) to carry views from all the
      participants

   o  relying on the IXP operator to implement routing policy decisions
      (see [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server])

   This document describes an alternate solution for BGP peering session
   endpoint information discovery.  This alternate solution reduces the
   administrative burden of configuring and maintaining BGP sessions in
   both IBGP applications (such as the full or partial mesh) and EBGP
   applications (such as at an IXP) as described above.  This document
   does not address the other reasons why operators may choose to take
   alternative approaches that still require manual configuration or
   relying other devices for routing information distribution; however,
   auto-discovery and manual configuration are not mutually exclusive,
   and it is expected that some network elements will utilize both
   approaches.

   In many cases existing route reflectors (in the IBGP use case) or
   route-servers (in the IXP) case may be utilized for the bootstrapping
   discovery mechanism in this document.  This has several advantages:

   o  Re-use of already deployed devices for an add on and incremental
      automated BGP peer discovery





Raszuk, et al.            Expires June 10, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     draft-raszuk-idr-bgp-auto-discovery     December 2019


   o  Current place and operation in the network is optimal for session
      establishment for the relevant subset of clients that need the
      information.

   o  A verification only mode to analyze and generate a warning only
      message when manual IBGP peering configuration mistakes are
      detected.

3.  Auto discovery mechanism

   The amount of discovery information distributed via this mechanism is
   likely to be orders of magnitude less than the amount of underlying
   prefix (or other information) distributed today by existing route
   reflectors or route servers, so scalability for this mechanism should
   not be a concern.

   This mechanism is designed to work on a per AFI/SAFI basis.  For
   example, a currently deployed route reflector, providing route
   reflection for IPv4 unicast routes could continue in that function
   and at the same time provide a BGP peer discovery functionality for
   that or other address families.  That could have a very positive
   effect for the deployment of any of the new address families as core
   RRs would not need to be upgraded to support new address families yet
   could still serve as information brokers for them.

   In order to propagate information describing their BGP active
   configuration (activated AFI/SAFIs) we propose to define a new
   address family with the NLRI format of <Group_ID:Router_ID>.

   The new address family will inherit current BGP update & msg formats
   as well as all necessary attributes used for normal and loop free BGP
   route distribution.

   The Group Identifier Group_ID is a four octet value, and Router_ID is
   a four octet value [RFC6286].

   The new type code for the new BGP Peer Discovery AFI/SAFI will be
   TBD1.

   The role of the Group_ID is to allow scoped group creation in the
   same ASN/AFI/SAFI tuple.  If not set by the operator, implying all
   peers will be in the same group, this value will be all zeros.

   The way to group mesh interconnectivity is left to the operator.  The
   Group_ID could be used for instance to group sub-AS or RR clients (if
   the RR is not doing client to client reflection), or for tying sets
   of EBGP peers to specific policy.  A similar model takes place today
   for interconnecting confederation Sub-ASes as described in [RFC5065].

   A new BGP Peer Discovery Attribute is defined to carry information
   about all activated and flagged for automatic provisioning AFI/SAFIs
   by a given BGP speaker.  The format of the new BGP Peer Discovery
   Attribute is defined below in Figure 1:

                       Figure 3: AFI/SAFI Descriptor

   AFI/SAFI Descriptor Flags (1 octet):

   o  O bit - Route originator or EBGP speaker (Yes - 1, No - 0)

   o  F bit - Force new peering.  Default not set - 0, set - 1.

   o  I bit - Informational only (Do not attempt to establish a BGP
      connection)

   Peer Autonomous System Number:

   o  This is the neighbor's BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN), as
      described in [RFC6793], that should be expected for peering, iBGP
      if it matches the local router ASN, eBGP otherwise.

   Identifier:

   o  This field is set to 0.  If a non-zero value is set then the peer
      connection should be viewed as a tuple of <AFI/SAFI/Identifier>.
      Also at the same time the peer connection should be viewed as
      <AFI/SAFI/Identifier> and a separate connection should be
      initiated if the peer connection is not yet established.

   Peering Address:

   o  Depending on the value of Peering AFI peering address on which BGP
      speaker is expecting to receive BGP session OPEN messages.

   The special value of AFI/SAFI Descriptor can be all zeros.  That will
   indicate that the information contained in the Group_id applies to
   all AFI/SAFIs given receiver supports.  In those cases BGP OPEN msg
   will negotiate the subset of AFI/SAFIs to be established between
   given BGP peers.

   It is expected that when Router_ID is changed on the BGP speaker
   sessions are restarted and therefore NLRI received with the former
   Router_ID withdrawn.  When sessions restart, the new Router_ID will
   be sent in the NLRI corresponding to the BGP speaker with the
   reconfigured Router_ID.  It is highly advised to change Router_ID
   only when critical as the impact to BGP is for any AFI/SAFI sever.
   An implementation may force the user to configure BGP Router_ID
   explicitly, before activating the new BGP Peer Discovery AFI/SAFI.

   From the RR perspective as each BGP speaker can have only one
   Router_ID value, there would be only a single BGP Peer Discovery NLRI
   originated by one.  It was a conscious design decision not to create
   a new BGP attribute for the reflector and require route reflector to
   build an aggregate list of AFI/SAFI descriptors common to given set
   of BGP Peer Discovery NLRIs in such a new attribute.  We prefer to
   allow RR to remain simple with no additional code changes required
   for the price of no update packing possibility when it handles BGP
   Peer Discovery NLRIs in an atomic way.

   Implementations MAY support local configuration of all possible
   remote peering address ranges, autonomous system numbers or other
   filters expected to be received via BGP Peer Discovery, or on a per
   group basis.  Implementations SHOULD allow operators to group
   specific auto-discovered peers with specific groups based on
   Group_ID.

   On the receive side, a persistent cache SHOULD be maintained by BGP
   with all received information about other BGP speakers announcing
   their BGP Peer Discovery information in a given Group's scope.

   BGP Peer Discovery implementation should allow for per address
   family, subsequent address family and Group_ID disjoint topologies
   granularity.

   When multiple AFI/SAFI pairs match on any two BGP speakers and value
   of the Identifier passed on AFI/SAFI Descriptor field is set to all
   zeros only one BGP session should be attempted.  Regular BGP
   capabilities will be used to negotiate given AFI/SAFI mutual set.
   AFI/SAFI granularity is required to allow for disjoint topologies of
   different information being distributed by BGP.

   BGP speakers "O" flag eligible may establish session with any other
   BGP speaker if passing all peering criteria for a given AFI/SAFI.

   BGP speakers "O" flag not eligible (ex: P routers) should not
   establish IBGP peering to any other "O" flag not eligible BGP
   speakers.

   When peering address changes for an existing AFI/SAFI and new BGP
   update is received with the new peering address old peering should
   remain intact when "F" flag is not set (default = 0).  When session
   is cleared manually or goes down for any other reason, the new
   peering address should be used.

   When "F" flag is set new peering address should be used immediately
   and current BGP session to the peer restarted for given AFI/SAFI.

4.  Deployment Considerations

   All implementations SHOULD still allow manual neighbor establishments
   which in fact could be complimentary and co-existing to the BGP Peer
   Auto Discovery neighbors.

   In addition BGP Peer Auto Discovery exchange can be enabled just for
   informational purposes while provisioning would remain manual before
   operational teams get familiar with new capability and verify it's
   mechanics.

   Within each Group_ID upon which auto-discovery is enabled, it is
   expected that neighbors will form sessions with all peers received
   within the group.  This allows the building of full-mesh or partial-
   mesh topologies of peers for iBGP by varying the Group_ID field.

   Incremental deployment with enabling just a few routers to advertise
   BGP Peer Discovery AF while maintaining manual configuration based
   peering with the rest of the network is supported.

   Another key aspect of today's BGP deployment, other then peer to peer
   filtering push via ORF [RFC5292], is outbound customization of BGP
   information to be distributed among various peers.  The most common
   tools for such customization could be peer templates, peer groups or
   any other similar local configuration grouping.  Individual members
   of such groups can still be added to them manually, and BGP auto-
   discovery peers can be grouped to such groups using the Group_ID.
   The Peer Discovery implementation supports the ability to specify
   peer ranges which could automatically achieve addition or deletion of
   BGP peers to such groups.  This can save a lot of manual
   configuration and customization for outbound policies shared by
   multiple peers.  Individual session customization would be still
   possible by manual provisioning.

5.  Capability Advertisement

   A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange BGP Peer Discovery Information
   must use the the BGP Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code as

   defined in [RFC4760], to advertise the corresponding (AFI, SAFI)
   pair.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP Auto Discovery SAFI type code TBD1
   which will be used to carry local BGP peering configuration data.
   That value will need to be assigned by IANA from BGP SAFI Type Code
   space.

   This document defines a new NLRI format, called BGP Auto Discovery
   NLRI, to be carried in BGP Auto Discovery SAFI using BGP
   multiprotocol extensions.  This document defines a new BGP optional
   transitive attribute, called BGP Peer Discovery Attribute.  A new
   attribute type code TBD2 is to be assigned by IANA from the BGP path
   attribute Type Code space.

   This document defines a new BGP Capability Type code (TBD3) to be
   allocated by IANA.

   Once TBD1, TBD2, and TBD3 values are allocated please replace them in
   the above text.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document allows for local configuration of BGP authentication
   mechanisms such as BGP-MD5 [RFC2385] or TCP-AO [RFC5925] and these
   are highly recommended for deployment on the BGP peer auto-discovery
   neighbor sessions.  Similar authentication could be configured on a
   per peer or peer-group basis based on the auto-discovery information
   received before session establishment, however no exchange of
   authentication information occurs within the protocol itself.
   Operators SHOULD NOT use peer auto-discovery with untrusted peers as
   attacks on implementation scalability could be triggered by
   overwhelming the router with a larger number of auto-discovery peers
   then can be supported.  Operators should also use caution on what
   addresses and AFI/SAFI combinations they want to allow reception of
   auto-discovery information for.

8.  Contributors

   The BGP auto-discovery idea contained in this document was originally
   developed by Pedro Roque Margues and Robert Raszuk in 2008 to cover
   the IBGP full mesh use case however it was not published at that
   time.
