 An Architecture for Data Model Driven Network Management: the Network
                          Virtualization Case
           draft-wu-model-driven-management-virtualization-01

Abstract

   Data Model driven network management can be used at various phases of
   service and network management life cycle such as service
   instantiation, service provision, optimization, monitoring, and
   diagnostic.  Also, it can be designed to provide closed-loop control
   for the sake of agile service creation, delivery and maintenance.

   This document describes an architecture for data model driven network
   management with a sample applicability case: network virtualization
   environments.

Internet-Draft           Model Driven Management               June 2018


1.  Introduction

   As observed in [I-D.arkko-arch-virtualization], many IETF discussions
   earlier in the summer of 2017 started from a top-down view of new
   virtualization technologies, but they were often unable to explain
   the necessary delta to the wealth of existing IETF technologies in
   this space.  Therefore, [I-D.arkko-arch-virtualization] considered a
   bottom-up approach to provide an overview of existing technologies
   which is aiming at identifying areas for further development.

   For years, the IETF has been driving the industry transition from an
   overloaded Software Defined Networking (SDN) buzzword to focus on
   specific areas such as data modeling-driven management.  [RFC7149]
   provides a first tentative to rationalize that space by identifying
   concrete technical domains that need to be considered:

   o  Techniques for the dynamic discovery of network topology, devices,
      and capabilities, along with relevant information and data models
      that are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and
      their capabilities.

   o  Techniques for exposing network services [RFC8309] and their
      characteristics.

   o  Techniques used by service-requirement-derived dynamic resource
      allocation and policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be
      programmed accordingly.

   o  Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
      efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
      service fulfillment and assurance perspective.

   Models are key for each of these technical items.

   In the later development, , as described in [RFC8199], YANG module
   developers have taken both top-down and bottom-up approaches to
   develop modules and establish mapping between network technology and
   customer requirements on the top or abstracting common construct from
   various network technologies.  At the time of writing this document
   (2018), we see the large number of data models including
   configuration models and service models developed or under
   development in IETF covering much of networking protocols and
   techniques.  In addition, how these models work together to fully
   configure a device, or manage a set of devices involved in a service
   aren't developed yet in IETF.

   This document takes both bottom up approach and top down approach to
   provide a framework that discusses the architecture for data model

   driven network management, with a focus on network virtualization
   environment.

   This document also describes specific YANG modules needed to realize
   connectivity services and investigates how top down built model
   (e.g., customer-facing data models) interact with bottom up built
   model (network resource-facing data models) in the context of service
   delivery and assurance.

2.  Architectural Concepts

2.1.  Data Models: Layering and Representation

   As described in [RFC8199], layering of modules allows for better
   reusability of lower-layer modules by higher-level modules while
   limiting duplication of features across layers.

   The IETF has developed large number of network level and device level
   modules and service level module.  Different service level modules
   may rely on the same set of network level or device level modules.
   Service level modules follow top down approach and are mostly
   customer-facing models providing a common model construct for higher
   level network services, which can be further mapped to network
   technology-specific models at lower layer.

   Network level modules mostly follow bottom up approach and are mostly
   network resource-facing model and describe various aspects of a
   network infrastructure, including devices and their subsystems, and
   relevant protocols operating at the link and network layers across
   multiple devices (e.g., Network topology and TE Tunnel modules).

   Device level modules follow bottom up approach and are mostly
   technology-specific modules used to realize a service.

2.2.  Service and Network Resources Exposure:

   Service level model defines a service ordered by a customer from an
   operator.  The service can be built from a combination of network
   elements and protocols configuration which also include various
   aspects of the underlying network infrastructure, including
   functions/devices and their subsystems, and relevant protocols
   operating at the link and network layers across multiple device.

2.3.  Service Element Configuration Model Composition

   To provide service agility (including network management automation),
   lower level technology-specific models need to be assembled together
   to provision each involved network function/device and operate the

   network based on service requirements described in the service level
   model.

   IETF RTGWG working group has already been tasked to define service
   elements configuration model composition mechanism and develop
   several composition model such as network instance model, logical
   network element model and device model.

   These models can be used to setup and administrate both virtualized
   system and physical system.

2.4.  A Catalog for YANG Modules

   The idea of a catalog is similar to service catalogs in traditional
   IT environments.  Service catalogs serve as a software-based
   registries of available services with information needed to discover
   and invoke available services.

   The IETF has already tasked to develop a YANG catalog which can be
   used to manage not only IETF defined modules, but also non-IETF
   defined ones [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog].

   The YANG catalog allows to align IETF work with other SDOs work and
   prevent duplicated building blocks being developed.  It also
   encourages reusability of common building blocks.

   The YANG catalog allows both YANG developers and operators to
   discover the more mature YANG modules that may be used to automate
   services operations .

3.1.  Network Service and Resource Models

   Service and Network Resource Exposure modules define what the
   "service"/"resource" is.  These modules can be classified into two
   categories:

   o  Network Service Models

   o  Network Resource Models

3.1.1.  Network Service Models: Definition and Samples

   As described in [RFC8309], the service is some form of connectivity
   between customer sites and the Internet or between customer sites
   across the network operator's network and across the Internet.

   For example,

   o  L3SM model [RFC8299] defines the L3VPN service ordered by a the
      customer from a network operator.

   o  L2SM model [I-D.ietf-l2sm-l2vpn-service-model] defines the L2VPN
      service ordered by a the customer from a network operator.

   o  L1CSM model [I-D.ietf-ccamp-l1csm-yang]defines a YANG data model
      for Layer 1 Connectivity Service Model (L1CSM).

   o  ACTN model [I-D. ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] defines YANG data model
      for the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered (TE)
      networks (ACTN) Virtual Network Service (VNS) operation.  Unlike
      L3SM model, ACTN model can also be used as operator facing model,
      e.g., establish interconnection between L3VPN sites across
      multiple ASs.

   o  TE service mapping model [I-D.lee-teas-te-service-mapping-yang] a
      YANG data model to map service model (e.g., L3SM) and Traffic
      Engineering model (e.g., TE Tunnel or ACTN VN model).  This model
      is applicable to the operation's need for a seamless control and
      management of their VPN services with TE tunnel support.

   o  Composite VPN model [I-D.chen-opsawg-composite-vpn-dm] the YANG
      data model of the composite VPN for operators to provision,
      optimize, monitor and diagnose the end to end PE-based VPN
      services across multiple autonomous systems (ASes).  The model
      from this document are limited to multiple ASes within one service
      provider.  Ulike L3SM model, Composite VPN model is operator
      facing model.

   The IETF is currently defining three other customer-facing modules:
   ietf-dots-signal-channel [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] and ietf-
   dots-data-channel [I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel] and I2NSF Consumer-
   Facing Interface YANG module
   [I-D.jeong-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm].  The first two
   modules are meant to be used by clients to signal DDoS attacks or to
   request installing filters for the sake of DDoS mitigation.  Those
   modules do not intervene directly in the configuration of underlying
   network devices.  The third module is required for enabling different

   users of a given I2NSF system to define, manage, and monitor security
   policies for specific flows within an administrative domain.

   Topology YANG Models:

   o  Network Topology Models: [I.D-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] defines
      base model for network topology and inventories.  Network topology
      data include link resource, node resource and terminate-point
      resource.

   o  TE Topology Models: [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] defines a data
      model for representing and manipulating TE Topologies.

      This module is extended from network topology model defined in
      [I.D-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] with TE topologies specifics.
      This model contains technology agnostic TE Topology building
      blocks that can be augmented and used by other technology-specific
      TE Topology models.

   o  L3 Topology Models

Internet-Draft           Model Driven Management               June 2018


      [I.D-ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology] defines a data model for
      representing and manipulating L3 Topologies.  This model is
      extended from the network topology model defined in [I.D-ietf-
      i2rs-yang-network-topo] with L3 topologies specifics.

   o  L2 Topology Models

      [I.D-ietf-i2rs-yang-l2-topology] defines a data model for
      representing and manipulating L2 Topologies.  This model is
      extended from the network topology model defined in [I.D-ietf-
      i2rs-yang-network-topo] with L2 topologies specifics.

   o  L3 TE Topology Models

      When traffic engineering is enabled on a layer 3 network topology,
      there will be a corresponding TE topology.  [I.D-liu-teas-yang-l3-
      te-topo] defines data models for layer 3 traffic engineering
      topologies.  Two data models are defined, one is layer 3 TE
      topology model, the other is packet switching TE topology model.
      Layer 3 TE topology model is extended from Layer 3 topology model.
      Packet switching TE topology model is extended from TE topology
      model.

   o  SR TE Topology Models

      [I-D.liu-teas-yang-sr-te-topo] defines a YANG module for Segment
      Routing (SR) topology and Segment Routing (SR) traffic engineering
      (TE) topology.  Two models are defined, one is SR topology model,
      the other is SR TE topology model, SR topology model is extended
      from L3 Topology model.  SR TE topology model is extended from
      both SR Topology model and L3 TE topology model.

   o  SF Aware TE Topology YANG Model

      [I-D.  ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model] defines a YANG data model
      for TE network topologies that are network service and function
      aware.

         yang]defines a YANG model for flexi-grid objects in the dynamic
         optical network, including the nodes, transponders and links
         between them, as well as how such links interconnect nodes and
         transponders.

   Tunnel YANG Models:

   o  TE Tunnel Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] defines a YANG module for the
      configuration and management of TE interfaces, tunnels and LSPs.

   o  SR TE Tunnel Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for Segment Routing (SR) TE
      specific data.

   o  MPLS TE Model

      [I.D-ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for MPLS TE configurations,
      state, RPC and notifications.

   o  RSVP-TE MPLS Model

      with parameters to configure and manage signaling of MPLS RSVP-TE
      LSPs.

   o  Optical Transport Tunnel Models:

      *  Flexigrid Media Channel Tunnel Models: [I-D.ccamp-flexigrid-
         media-channel-yang] defines a YANG model for the flexi-grid

      [I.D-ietf-teas-path-computation] yang model for a stateless RPC
      which complements the stateful solution defined in [I.D-ietf-teas-
      yang-te].

   o  OAM Models

      [I.D-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam] defines a base YANG module
      for the management of OAM protocols that use Connectionless
      Communications.  [I.D-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods]
      defines a retrieval method YANG module for connectionless OAM
      protocols.  [I.D-ietf-lime-yang-connection-oriented-oam-model]
      defines a base YANG module for connection oriented OAM protocols.
      These three models can be used to provide consistent reporting,
      configuration and representation.

   o  PM Models

   o  Alarm Models

      Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
      Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the
      network services or necessarily point to the root cause.  [I.D-
      ietf-ccamp-alarm-module]defines a YANG module for alarm
      management.

   o  Generic Policy Model

      The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based
      management framework [RFC8328] defines base YANG data models to
      encode policy.  These models point to device-, technology-, and
      service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.  Policy
      rules within an operator's environment can be used to express
      high-level, possibly network-wide, policies to a network
      management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a
      network element).  The network management function can then
      control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements
      and services.  This document describes the SUPA basic framework,
      its elements, and interfaces.

3.2.  Network Element Models

   Network Element models are used to describe how a service can be
   implemented by activating and tweaking a set of functions (enabled in
   one or multiple devices) that are involved in the service delivery.

3.2.1.  Model Composition

   o  Device Model

      [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-device-model] presents an approach for organizing
      YANG models in a comprehensive logical structure that may be used
      to configure and operate network devices.The structure is itself
      represented as an example YANG model, with all of the related
      component models logically organized in a way that is
      operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be
      implemented.

   o  Logical Network Element Model

      [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-lne-model] defines a logical network element
      module which can be used to manage the logical resource
      partitioning that may be present on a network device.  Examples of
      common industry terms for logical resource partitioning are
      Logical Systems or Logical Routers.

   o  Network Instance Model

      [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-ni-model] defines a network instance module.  This
      module can be used to manage the virtual resource partitioning
      that may be present on a network device.  Examples of common
      industry terms for virtual resource partitioning are Virtual
      Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch
      Instances (VSIs).

3.2.1.1.  Schema Mount

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount] defines a
   mechanism, denoted schema mount, that allows for mounting one data
   model consisting of any number of YANG modules at a specified
   location of another (parent) schema.

   That capability does not cover design time.

3.2.2.  Protocol/Function Configuration Models

   BGP:       [I-D.mks-idr-bgp-yang-model] defines a YANG module for
              configuring and managing BGP, including protocol, policy,
              and operational aspects based on data center, carrier and
              content provider operational requirements.

   MPLS:      [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang] defines a base model for MPLS
              which serves as a base framework for configuring and
              managing an MPLS switching subsystem.  It is expected that
              other MPLS technology YANG models (e.g.  MPLS LSP Static,
              LDP or RSVP-TE models) will augment the MPLS base YANG
              model.

   QoS:       [I-D.asechoud-netmod-diffserv-model] describes a YANG
              model of Differentiated Services for configuration and
              operations.

   ACL:       Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements
              used to configure device forwarding behavior.  It is used
              in many networking technologies such as Policy Based
              Routing, Firewalls etc.  [I.D-ietf-netmod-acl-model]
              describes a data model of Access Control List (ACL) basic
              building blocks.

   NAT:       For the sake of network automation and the need for
              programming Network Address Translation (NAT) function in
              particular, a data model for configuring and managing the
              NAT is essential.  [I.D-ietf-opsawg-nat-yang] defines a
              YANG module for the NAT function.

   Multicast: [I-D.ietf-pim-yang] defines a YANG module that can be used
              to configure and manage Protocol Independent Multicast
              (PIM) devices.  [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-yang] defines a
              YANG module that can be used to configure and manage
              Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast
              Listener Discovery (MLD) devices.

   Microwave: [I-D. ietf-ccamp-mw-yang] defines a YANG data model for
              control and management of the radio link interfaces, and
              their connectivity to packet(typically Ethernet)
              interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node.

   EVPN:      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] defines a YANG data model for
              Ethernet VPN services.The model is agnostic of the
              underlay.  It apply to MPLS as well as to VxLAN
              encapsulation.  The model is also agnostic of the services
              including E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE services.  This
              document mainly focuses on EVPN and Ethernet-Segment
              instance framework.

   L3VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang] defines a YANG model that can
              be used to configure and manage BGP L3VPNs [RFC4364].  It
              contains VRF sepcific parameters as well as BGP specific
              parameters applicable for L3VPNs.

   L2VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] defines a YANG data model for
              MPLS based Layer 2 VPN services (L2VPN) [RFC4664] and
              includes switching between the local attachment circuits.
              The L2VPN model covers point-to-point VPWS and Multipoint
              VPLS services.  These services use signaling of
              Pseudowires across MPLS networks using LDP
              [RFC8077][RFC4762] or BGP[RFC4761].

   Routing Policy:  [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] defines a YANG data
              model for configuring and managing routing policies in a

              vendor-neutral way and based on actual operational
              practice.  The model provides a generic policy framework
              which can be augmented with protocol-specific policy
              configuration.

   BFD:       [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]defines a YANG data model that can be
              used to configure and manage Bidirectional Forwarding
              Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].  BFD is a network protocol
              which is used for liveness detection of arbitrary paths
              between systems.

4.1.  End-to-End Service Delivery and Service Assurance Procedure

4.1.1.  Resource Collection and Abstraction (a)

   Network Resource such as links, nodes, or terminate-point resources
   can be collected from the network and aggregated or abstracted to the
   management system.  Periodic fetching of data is not an adequate
   solution for applications requiring frequent or prompt updates of
   network resource.  Applying polling-based solutions to retrieve
   network resource also imposes a load on networks, devices, and
   applications.These limitations can be addressed by including generic
   object subscription mechanisms within network elements.

   These resources can be modelled using network topology model, L3
   topology model, L2 topology model, TE topology model, L3 TE topology
   model, SR TE topology models at different layers.

   In some cases, there may have multiple overlay topologies built on
   top of the same underlay topology, and the underlay topology can be
   also built from one or more lower layer underlay topology.

   In some cases, there may have multiple overlay topologies built on
   top of the same underlay topology, and the underlay topology can be
   also built from one or more lower layer underlay topology.  The
   network resources and management objects in these multi-layer
   topologies are not recommended to be exposed to customers who (will)
   order the service from the management system, instead it will be
   exposed to the management system for IP service mapping and TE path
   Management.

   The abstract view is likely to be technology-agnostic.

4.1.2.  Service Exposure & Abstraction (b)

   Service exposure & abstraction is used to capture services offered to
   customers.

   Service abstraction can be used by a customer to request a service
   (ordering and order handling).  One typical example is that a
   customer can use L3SM service model to request L3VPN service by
   providing the abstract technical characterization of the intended
   service.  Such L3VPN service describes various aspects of network
   infrastructure, including devices and their subsystems, and relevant
   protocols operating at the link and network layers across multiple
   device.  The L3SM service model can be used to interact with the
   network infrastructure, e.g., configure sites, decide QoS parameters
   to be applied to each network access within a site, select PEs, CEs,
   etc.

   Service catalogs can be created to expose the various services and
   the information needed to invoke/order a given service.

   YANG modules can be grouped into various service bundles; each
   service bundle is corresponding to a set of YANG modules that have
   been released or published.  Then, a mapping can be established
   between service abstraction and service bundles at higher layer and
   between service bundle and a set of YANG modules at lower layer.

4.1.3.  IP Service Mapping (c)

   Service abstraction starts with high-level abstractions exposing the
   business capabilities or capturing customer requirements.  Then, it
   needs to maps them to resource abstraction and specific network
   technologies.

   Therefore, the interaction between service abstraction and resource
   abstraction or between overlay and underlay is required.  For
   example, in the L3SM service model, we describe VPN service topology
   including sites relationship, e.g., hub and spoke and any to any,
   single homed, dual-homed, multi-homed relation between PEs and CEs,
   but we don't know how this service topology can be mapped into
   underlying network topology.  For detailed interaction, please refer
   to Section 4.1.7

   In addition, there is a need to decide on a mapping between service
   abstraction and underlying specific network technologies.  Take L3SM
   service model as an example, to realize L3VPN service, we need to map
   L3SM service view defined in Service model into detailed
   configuration view defined by specific configuration models for
   network elements, these configuration models include:

   o  VRF definition, including VPN Policy expression

   o  Physical Interface

   o  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6).

   o  QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in the document, as well as routing policies associated
      with those protocols.

   o  Multicast Support

   o  NAT

4.1.4.  IP Service Composition (d)

   These detailed configuration models are further assembled together
   into service bundle using, e.g., device model, logical network
   element model or network instance model defined in [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-
   device-model] [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-lne-model] [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-ni-model]
   provide the association between an interface and its associated LNE
   and NI and populate into appropriate devices(e.g., PE and CE).

4.1.5.  IP Service Provision (e)

   IP Service Provision is used to provision service or network
   infrastructure using various configuration models, e.g., use service
   element models such as BGP, ACL, QoS, Interface model, Network
   instance models to configure PE and CE device within the site.  BGP
   Policy model is used to establish VPN membership between sites and
   VPN Service Topology.  Traditionally, "push" service element
   configuration model one by one to the network device and provide
   association between an interface and each service element
   configuration model is not efficient.

   To automate configuration of the service elements, we first assemble
   all related service elements models into logical network element
   model defined in [I.D-ietf-rtgwg-lne-model] and then establish
   association with an interface and a set of service elements.

   In addition, IP Service Provision can be used to setup tunnels
   between sites and setup tunnels between PE and CE within the site
   when tunnels related configuration parameters can be generated from
   service abstraction.However when tunnels related configuration
   parameters can not be generated from service abstraction, IP Service
   to TE Mapping procedure is required.

4.1.6.  IP Service to TE Mapping (e)

   In L3SM Service Model, the management system will have to determine
   where to connect each site-network-access of a particular site to the
   provider network (e.g., PE, aggregation switch).  L3SM Service model
   proposes parameters and constraints that can influence the meshing of
   the site-network-access.

   Nodes used to connect a site may be captured in relevant clauses of a
   service exposure model (e.g., Customer Nodes Map [RFC7297]).

   When Site location is determined, PE and CE device location will be
   selected.  Then we can replace parameters and constraints that can
   influence the meshing of the site-network-access with specified PE
   and CE device information associated with site- network-access and
   generate resource facing VN Overlay Resource model.One example of
   resource facing VN Overlay Resource model is ACTN VN Service Model.

   This VN Overlay Resource model can be used to calculate node and link
   resource to Meet service requirements based on Network Topology
   models collected at step (a).

4.1.7.  Path Management (f)

   Path Management includes Path computation and Path setup.  For
   example, we can translate L3SM service model into resource facing VN
   Overlay Resource Model, with selected PE and CE in each site, we can
   calculate point to point or multipoint end to end path between sites
   based on VPN Overlay Resource Model.

   After identifying node and link resources required to meet service
   requirements, the mapping between overlay topology and underlay
   topology can be set, e.g., establish an association between VPN
   service topology defined in customer facing model and underlying
   network topology defined in I2RS network topology model (e.g., one
   overlay node is supported by multiple underlay nodes, one overlay
   link is supported by multiple underlay nodes)and generate end to end
   VN topology model.

4.1.8.  Performance Measurement and Alarm Telemetry (g)

   Once the mapping between overlay and underlay has been setup, PM and
   Warning information per link based on end to end VN topology can be
   collected and report to the management system.

   Performance metrics can be collected before instantiating a service,
   too.

4.1.9.  TE Resource Exposure (h)

   When tunnels related configuration parameters can not be generated
   from service abstraction, IP Service to TE Mapping procedure can be
   used to generate TE Resource Exposure view, this TE reource Exposure
   view can be modeled as resource facing VN model which is translated
   and instantiated from L3SM model and manage TE resource based on path
   management information and PM and alarm telemetry information.

   Operators may use this dedicated TE resource Exposure view to
   dynamically capture the overall network status and topology to:

   o  Perform all the requested recovery operations upon detecting
      network failures affecting the network service.

   o  Adjust resource distribution and update to end to end Service
      topology models

   o  Provide resource scheduling to better guarantee services for
      customers and to improve the efficiency of network resource usage.

   o  Pre-provision multiple (virtualized) overlay networks on top of
      the same basic network infrastructure and establish resource pool
      for each overlay network.

   o  Request to create two sites based on L3SM Service model with each
      having one network access connectivity:

         Site A: Network-Access A, Bandwidth=20M, for class "foo",
         guaranteed-bw-percent = 10, One-Way-Delay=70 msec

         Site B: Network-Access B, Bandwidth=30M, for class "foo1",
         guaranteed-bw-percent = 15, One-Way-Delay=60 msec

   o  Select appropriate virtualized overlay networks topology based on
      Service Type and service requirements defined in L3SM service
      model.

   o  Translate L3SM service model into resource facing VN Network
      Model, based on selected virtualized overlay network topology and
      PE and CE info in the generated resource facing VN network model,
      calculate node resource, link resource corresponding to
      connectivity between sites or connectivity between PE and CE
      within a Site.

   o  Setup tunnels between sites and tunnels between PE and CE within a
      Site and map them into the selected (virtualized) overlay topology
      and establish resource facing VN topology model.

      The source facing VN topology model and corresponding Tunnel model
      can be used to notify all the parameter changes and event related
      to VN topology or Tunnel.  These information can be further used
      to adjust network resource distributing in the network.
