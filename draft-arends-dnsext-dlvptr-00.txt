Internet-Draft               DLV Pointer RR                     May 2007


1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) [4] [2][5] is a method to publish
   Trust Anchors (TAs) for islands of security [3] outside the
   delegation chain.  This, in turn, has the potential for efficient TA
   management on the validator, as the validator can configure the TA
   for the DLV repository, instead of TAs for each island of security.

   Due to the design of DLV it is not efficient to have more than a few
   TAs for DLV repositories.  DLV requires the validator to send
   additional requests to each DLV repository for each response, for
   which there is no configured TA.

   This memo introduces a change to the design of DLV.  An island of
   security can publish a pointer (DLVPTR) to the DLV repository of
   choice.  When the validator has a configured TA for this DLV,
   additional requests will be send to just this DLV.

   This change allows configuration of multiple DLV TAs in a validator
   without significantly degrading response times.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


2.  DLVPTR Processing

   A Security Aware Resolver sends requests with the DNSSEC-OK bit set,
   regardless of any configured TA.  It expects the zone at a configured
   TA to be secured, and thus responses to contain DNSSEC records.

   When a Security Aware Resolver has no TAs configured for a requested
   name, and has one or more DLV-TAs configured, and receives a response
   for that name containing DNSSEC records, it sends a request for a
   DLVPTR to the highest point in the delegation chain that contained
   DNSSEC records.

      DLV-ANCHOR && DLVPTR && DLV == record
      DLV-ANCHOR && (!DLV) == remove


3.  The DLVPTR Resource Record

3.1.  The DLVPTR RDATA Format

   The DLVPTR (type=TBD) record contains a domain name.

         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         /                 DLVPTRDNAME                   /
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   A DLVPTR record causes no additional section processing.  DLVPTR RRs
   are used in domains to point to some other location in the domain
   space.

3.2.  Presentation Format of the DLVPTR RR

   The RDATA of the presentation format of the DLVPTR resource record
   consists of one string (the domain name of the target DLV [2]), e.g.:

         example.net.  DLVPTR  xyzzy.dlv.arpa.


4.  Security Considerations


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to allocate a RR type code for DLVPTR from the standard RR
   type space (type 50 requested).
