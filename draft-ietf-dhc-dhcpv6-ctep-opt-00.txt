  Abstract 
      
     For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly  
     deployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been 
     proposed.  One such mechanism is configured tunnels.  This document 
     provides a mechanism by which the DHCPv6 servers can provide 
     information about the various configured tunnel end points to reach 
     the IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.

  INTERNET-DRAFT           CTEP Option for DHCPv6           January 2004 
   
   
  1. Introduction 
      
     In the initial deployment of IPv6, the IPv6 nodes may need to 
     communicate with the other IPv6 nodes via IPv4 networks.  Configured 
     tunnels [3] provide a way to encapsulate the IPv6 packets in IPv4 
     packets and tunnel them in the IPv4 network.   
      
     This document defines a new option called Configured Tunnel End 
     Point by which the DHCPv6 [1] server can notify the client with the 
     list of end point of the configured tunnels to the various IPv6 
     networks separated by the IPv4 networks. 
   
   
  2. Requirements 
      
     The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, 
     SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this 
     document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] 
   
   
  3. Terminology 
      
     This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as 
     defined in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [1]. 
   
   
  4. Configured Tunnel End Point Option 
      
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Option gives the information to the 
     clients about the Configured Tunnel End Point [3] to be contacted 
     for reaching the nodes in the various IPv6 networks which are 
     separated by IPv4 networks.  The clients are expected to install 
     these routes in their machines. 
      
     The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Option is as shown 
     below:

     The clients are expected to install the routes identified by the 
     tuples <Destination Prefix/prefix-len, Configured TEP Address> once 
     they receive this option from the server. 
   
   
  5. Appearance of this option  
      
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Option MUST NOT appear in other  
     than the following messages:  Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, 
     Rebind, Information-Request and Reply. 
      
     The option numbers of Configured Tunnel End Point option MAY appear 
     in the Option Request Option [1] in the following messages:  Solicit, 
     Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure. 
   
   
  6. Security Considerations  
      
     The Configured Tunnel End Point Option may be used by an intruder  
     DHCPv6 server to provide invalid or incorrect configured tunnel end 
     point.  This makes the client unable to reach its destination IPv6 
     node or to reach incorrect destination.  The latter one has very 
     severe security issues as IPv6 destination is spoofed here. 
      
     To avoid attacks through this option, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use 
     authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" in 
     the DHCPv6 specification [1]). 
   
   
  7. IANA Considerations 
      
     IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options 
     from the option-code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of 
     the DHCPv6 specification [1]. 
      
     Option Name       Value           Described in  
     OPTION_CTEP        TBD             Section 4
