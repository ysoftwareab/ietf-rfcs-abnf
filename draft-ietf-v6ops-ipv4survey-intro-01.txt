1.0 Introduction


This document is the introduction to a document set aiming to 
document all usage of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards. In an effort to
have the information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 
documents conforming to the current IETF areas (Application[1],  
Internet[2], Manangement & Operations[3], Routing[4], Security[5], 
Sub-IP[6] and Transport[7]).  It also describes the methodology used 
during documentation, which type of RFCs that has been documented, 
and a concatenated summary of results.



1.1 Short Historical Perspective

There are many challenges that face the Internet Engineering community.
The foremost of these challenges has been the scaling issue.  How to 
grow a network that was envisioned to handle thousands of hosts to one 
that will handle tens of millions of networks with billions of hosts.  
Over the years this scaling problem has been overcome with changes to 
the network layer and to routing protocols.  (Ignoring the tremendous 
advances in computational hardware)

The first "modern" transition to the network layer occurred in during 
the early 1980's from the Network Control Protocol (NCP) to IPv4.  This
culminated in the famous "flag day" of January 1, 1983.  This version of
IP was documented in RFC 760.  This was a version of IP with 8 bit 
network and 24 bit host addresses.  A year later IP was updated in RFC 
791 to include the famous A, B, C, D, & E class system.

Networks were growing in such a way that it was clear that a need for
breaking networks into smaller pieces was needed.  In October of 1984 
RFC 917 was published formalizing the practice of subnetting.

By the late 1980's it was clear that the current exterior routing 
protocol used by the Internet (EGP) was not sufficient to scale with the
growth of the Internet.  The first version of BGP was documented in 
1989 in RFC 1105.

The next scaling issues to became apparent in the early 1990's was the
exhaustion of the Class B address space.  The growth and 
commercialization of the Internet had organizations requesting IP 
addresses in alarming numbers.  In May of 1992 over 45% of the Class B 
space was allocated.  In early 1993 RFC 1466 was published directing 
assignment of blocks of Class C's be given out instead of Class B's.  
This solved the problem of address space exhaustion but had significant 
impact of the routing infrastructure.

The number of entries in the "core" routing tables began to grow
exponentially as a result of RFC 1466.  This led to the implementation 
of BGP4 and CIDR prefix addressing.  This may have solved the problem 
for the present but there are still potential scaling issues.

Current Internet growth would have long overwhelmed the current address
space if industry didn't supply a solution in Network Address 
Translators (NATs).  To do this the Internet has sacrificed the 
underlying "End-to-End" principle.

In the early 1990's the IETF was aware of these potential problems and
began a long design process to create a successor to IPv4 that would
address these issues.  The outcome of that process was IPv6.

The purpose of this document is not to discuss the merits or problems of
IPv6.  That is a debate that is still ongoing and will eventually be
decided on how well the IETF defines transition mechanisms and how
industry accepts the solution.  The question is not "should," but 
"when."


1.2 A Brief Aside

Throughout this document there are discussions on how protocols might be
updated to support IPv6 addresses.  Although current thinking is that 
IPv6 should suffice as the dominant network layer protocol for the 
lifetime of the author, it is not unreasonable to contemplate further 
upgrade to IP.  Work done by the IRTF Interplanetary Internet Working 
Group shows one idea of far reaching thinking.  It may be a reasonable 
idea (or may not) to consider designing protocols in such a way that 
they can be either IP version aware or independent.  This idea must be 
balanced against issues of simplicity and performance.  Therefore it is 
recommended that protocol
designer keep this issue in mind in future designs.

Just as a reminder, remember the words of Jon Postel:

	"Be conservative in what you send; be liberal in what
         you accept from others."


1.3 An Observation on the Classification of Standards

It has become clear during the course of this investigation that there
has been little management of the status of standards over the years.
Some attempt has been made by the introduction of the classification of
standards into Full, Draft, Proposed, Experimental, and Historic.
However, there has not been a concerted effort to actively manage the
classification for older standards.  Standards are only classified as
Historic when either a newer version of the protocol is deployed,
it is randomly noticed that an RFC describes a long dead protocol, or
a serious flaw is discovered in a protocol.  Another issue is the status
of Proposed Standards.  Since this is the entry level position for
protocols entering the standards process, many old protocols or non-
implemented protocols linger in this status indefinitely.  This problem
also exists for Experimental Standards.  Similarly the problem exists
for the Best Current Practices (BCP) and For You Information (FYI)
series of documents.

It is the intention of the author to actively pursue the active
management of protocol series.  There is no current responsibility in
the management structure of the IETF (WG, AD, IESG, IETF-Chair, IAB
RFC Editor, or IANA) to perform this function.  All of these positions
are usually concerned with the current and future developments of
protocols in the standards process (i.e. they look at the present and
the future, but not the past).

It is likely that unless this function is formalized in some way, that
any individual effort will be of limited duration.  It is therefore
proposed that this responsibility be embodied formally.  Three possible
suggestion are the creation of a working group in the General Area be
created to actively and periodically review the status of RFC
classifications.  A second possibility is to more formally and actively
have this duty taken up by the RFC Editor.  A final possibility is the
creation of a permanent position (similar to the RFC Editor) who is
responsible for the active management of the document series.

To exemplify this point, there are 61 Full Standards, only 4 of which
have been reclassified to Historic. There are 65 Draft Standards, 611
Proposed Standards, and 150 Experimental RFCs, of which only 66
have been reclassified as Historic.  That is a rate of less than 8%.
It should be obvious that in the more that 30 years of protocol
development and documentation there should be at least as many (if
not a majority of) protocols that have been retired compared to the ones
that are currently active.

Please note that there is occasionally some confusion of the meaning of
a "Historic" classification.  It does NOT necessarily mean that the
protocol is not being used.  A good example of this concept is the
Routing Information Protocol(RIP) version 1.  There are many thousands
of sites using this protocol even though it has Historic status.  There
are potentially hundreds of otherwise classified RFC's that should be
reclassified.


2.0 Methodology

To perform this study each class of IETF standards are investigated in
order of maturity:  Full, Draft, and Proposed, as well as Experimental.
Informational RFC are not addressed.  RFCs that have been obsoleted by
either newer versions or as they have transitioned through the standards
process are not covered.

Please note that a side effect of this choice of methodology is that
some protocols that are defined by a series of RFC's that are of 
different levels of standards maturity are covered in different spots 
in the document.  Likewise other natural groupings (i.e. MIBs, SMTP 
extensions, IP over FOO, PPP, DNS, etc.) could easily be imagined.


2.1 Scope

The procedure used in this investigation is an exhaustive reading of the
applicable RFC's.  This task involves reading approximately 25000 pages
of protocol specifications.  To compound this, it was more than a 
process of simple reading.  It was necessary to attempt to understand 
the purpose and functionality of each protocol in order to make a proper
determination of IPv4 reliability.  The author has made ever effort to 
make this effort and the resulting document as complete as possible, but
it is likely that some subtle (or perhaps not so subtle) dependence was 
missed.  The author encourage those familiar (designers, implementers 
or anyone who has an intimate knowledge) with any protocol to review 
the appropriate sections and make comments.


3.0  Summary of Results

In the initial survey of RFCs 177 positives were identified, broken
down as follows:

	Standards				 26 or 38.25%
	Draft Standards				 19 or 29.23%
	Proposed Standards			110 or 13.94%
	Experimental RFCs			 23 or 20.13%

Of those identified many require no action because they document 
outdated and unused protocols (see STD 44/RFC 891 in Section 3.44 for
example), while others are document protocols that are actively being
updated by the appropriate working groups (SNMP MIBs for example).  
Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be 
updated but do not cause any operational impact (STD 3/RFCs 1122 & 1123 
for example) if they are not updated.  The remaining instances are 
documented below.



3.1  Standards


3.1.1  STD3  Requirements for Internet Hosts (RFC 1122 & 1123)

RFC 1122 is essentially a requirements document for IPv4 hosts and a
similar document for IPv6 hosts should be written.

RFC 1123 should be updated to include advances in application 
protocols, as well as tightening language regarding IP addressing. 


3.1.2 STD 4  Router Requirements (RFC 1812)

RFC 1812 should be updated to include IPv6 Routing Requirements (once
they are finalized)


3.1.3 STD 5 Internet Protocol (RFC 791, 922, 792, & 1122)

RFC 791 has been updated in the definition of IPv6 in RFC 2460.

RFC 922 has been included in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture, RFC 
2373.

RFC 792 has been updated in the definition of ICMPv6 in RFC 2463.

RFC 1122 has been updated in the definition of Multicast Listener 
Discovery in RFC 2710.


3.1.4 STD 7 Transmission Control Protocol (RFC 793)

Section 3.1 defines the technique for computing the TCP checksum that
uses the 32 bit source and destination IPv4 addresses.  This problem is
addressed in RFC 2460 Section 8.1.


3.1.5 STD 9 File Transfer Protocol (RFC 959)

Problems have been fixed in RFC 2428 FTP Extensions for IPv6 and NATs


3.1.6 STD 10 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC 821)

The use of literal IP addresses as part of email addresses
(i.e. phil@10.10.10.10) is depreciated and therefore no additional
specifications for using literal IPv6 addresses should not be
defined.


3.1.7 STD 11 Standard for the format of ARPA Internet Text Messages
		 RFC 822
See the above section (3.1.6).

3.1.8 STD 12 Network Time Protocol (RFC 1305)
As documented in Section 3.12 above, there are many specific steps
that assume the use of 32-bit IPv4 addresses.  An updated specification
to support NTP over IPv6 packets must be created.


3.1.9 STD 13 Domain Name System (RFCs 1034 & 1035)
New resource records for IPv6 addresses have been defined (AAAA & A6).

3.1.10 STD 15 Simple Network Management Protocol (RFCs 1157, 1155, 1213)
The limitations identified have been addressed.

3.1.11 STD 19 Netbios over TCP/UDP (RFCs 1001 & 1002)
These two RFCs have many inherent IPv4 assumptions and a new set of 
protocols must be defined.

3.1.12 STD 35 ISO Transport over TCP (RFC 1006)
This problem has been fixed in RFC 2126, ISO Transport Service on 
top of TCP.

3.1.13 STD 36 IP and ARP over FDDI (RFC 1390)
This problem has been fixed by RFC2467, A Method for the Transmission 
of IPv6 Packets over FDDI Networks.

3.1.14 STD 41 IP over Ethernet (RFC 894)
This problem has been fixed by RFC2464, A Method for the Transmission 
of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks.

3.1.15 STD 42 IP over Experimental Ethernets (RFC 895)
See above section.

3.1.16 STD 43 IP over IEEE 8.02 (RFC 1042)
The functionality of this RFC is included in subsequent standards 
defining IPv6 over XXX.

3.1.17 STD 44 DCN Networks (RFC 891)
This protocol is no longer used and an updated protocol should not 
be created.

3.1.18 STD 45 IP over HyperChannel (RFC 1044)
No updated document exists for this protocol.  It is unclear whether one
is needed.  An updated protocol may be created.

3.1.19 STD 46 IP over Arcnet (RFC 1201)
This problem has been fixed by RFC 2497, A Method for the Transmission 
of IPv6 Packets over ARCnet Networks.
 		
3.1.20 STD 48 IP over Netbios (RFC 1088)

A new protocol specification for tunneling IPv6 packets through Netbios
networks should be defined.


3.1.21 STD 49 802.2 Over IPX (RFC 1132)

This protocol specification is not tightly defined and it can easily be
updated to tighten the language and explicitly include IPv6 packets.  
Since it defines a generic way of tunneling many protocols over IPX 
networks and the large installed base of IPX networks, an updated RFC
should be written.


3.1.22 STD 52 IP over SMDS (RFC 1209)

An updated protocol for the transmission of IPv6 packets over SMDS must 
be written.


3.1.23 STD 54 OSPF (RFC 2328)

This problem has been fixed by RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.


3.1.24 STD 56 RIPv2 (RFC 2453)

4.0  Discussion of "Long Term" Stability of Addresses on Protocols

In attempting this analysis it was determined that a full scale 
analysis is well beyond the scope of this document.  Instead a short
discussion is presented on how such a framework might be established.

A suggested approach would be to do an analysis of protocols based on 
their overall function, similar (but not strictly) to the OSI network
reference model.   It might be more appropriate to frame the discussion
in terms of the different Areas of the IETF.  

The problem is fundamental to the overall architecture of the Internet
and its future.  One of the stated goals of the IPng (now IPv6) was 
"automatic" and "easy" address renumbering.  An additional goal is
"stateless autoconfiguration."  To these ends, a substantial amount of
work has gone into the development of such protocols as DHCP and Dynamic
DNS.  This goes against the Internet age-old "end-to-end principle."

Most protocol designs implicitly count on certain underlying principles
that currently exist in the network.  For example, the design of packet
switched networks allows upper level protocols to ignore the underlying
stability of packet routes.  When paths change in the network, the 
higher level protocols are typically unaware and uncaring.  This works
well since whether the packet goes A-B-C-D-E-F or A-B-X-Y-Z-E-F is of
little consequence. 

In a world where endpoints (i.e. A and F in the example above) change 
at a "rapid" rate, a new model for protocol developers should be 
considered.  It seems that a logical development would be a change in 
the operation of the Transport layer protocols.  The current model is
essentially a choice between TCP and UDP,  Neither of these protocols
provides any mechanism for an orderly handoff of the connection if and
when the network endpoint (IP) addresses changes.  Perhaps a third 
major transport layer protocol should be developed, or perhaps updated
TCP & UDP specifications that include this function might be a better
solution.  

There are many, many variables that would need to go into a successful
development of such a protocol.  Some issues to consider are: timing 
principles; overlap periods as an endpoint moves from address A, to 
addresses A & B (answers to both), to  only B; delays due to the 
recalculation of routing paths, etc...


5.0 Security Consideration

This memo examines the IPv6-readiness of specifications; this does not
have security considerations in itself.
