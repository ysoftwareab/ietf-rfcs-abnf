Abstract

   This document defines three X.509 v3 Certificate Extensions.  The
   first binds a list of IP Address blocks to the public key of the
   subject of a certificate.  The second binds a list of Autonomous
   System Numbers to the public key of the subject of a certificate.
   The third binds a BGP Router Identifier and an Autonomous System
   Number to the public key of the subject of a certificate.  Third
   parties, e.g., BGP routers, may use these certificates to verify that
   the holder of the private key corresponding to the public key in the
   certificate has been properly authorized to use resources specified
   in the certificate extension.

Internet Draft     X.509 Extensions for Authorization       October 1999

1.  Introduction

   Internet routing is based on a distributed system composed of many
   routers, grouped into management domains called Autonomous Systems
   (ASes).  Routing information is exchanged between ASes in Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC1771, BGP4] UPDATE messages.  BGP has
   proven to be highly vulnerable to a variety of attacks [Murphy], due
   to the lack of a scalable means of verifying the authenticity and
   legitimacy of BGP control traffic.

   Verification of the legitimacy of the control traffic requires that
   several conditions be met.  Some of the conditions are:

   *  The AS number of each peer in a BGP peering session has been
      authorized for use and to be a neighboring AS.

   *  The peer that sends an UPDATE was authorized to act on behalf of
      its AS to advertise the routing information contained within the
      UPDATE to BGP peers in the recipient AS.

   *  The AS that originates an UPDATE was authorized, by the owners of
      the address space corresponding to the set of reachable
      destinations, to advertise those destinations.

   *  The owner of an address space corresponding to a reachable
      destination advertised in an UPDATE was authorized by its parent
      organization to own that address space.

   Checking these conditions requires a mechanism that can be used to
   verify: the ownership of IP Address Prefixes, the ownership of AS
   Numbers, and the authorization of a router to represent an AS.  The
   mechanism must scale to the projected number of address prefixes, AS
   numbers, and inter-AS routers in the Internet.  Due to the
   distributed nature of Internet routing, the entities that are
   checking the conditions will generally be unknown to the entities
   that own these resources, and thus any mechanism that requires a peer
   to peer security relationship between the entities will not meet the
   scaling requirements.

   Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) have been designed to solve such
   problems.  PKIs can be created, rooted at the Internet Corporation
   for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN, formerly IANA), that
   corresponds to the assignment delegation system for IP address
   prefixes and AS numbers that is currently used in the Internet.

   This document describes these PKIs and defines the X.509 Certificate
   Extensions that they use to convey the necessary authorizations.  See
   [RFC2459] for a more complete description certificates, CRLs, and the
   PKIX X.509 profile.

   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  X.509 Certificate Extensions

   Version 3 of X.509 [X.509] provides an extensible mechanism to
   include application specific information in certificates.  Each
   extension contains three elements: an OBJECT IDENTIFIER that is
   associated with the syntax of the application specific data, a
   BOOLEAN that indicates if the certificate user must reject the
   certificate if it does not properly process the extension, and the
   application specific data encoded in an OCTET STRING.

   The ASN.1 specification for an X.509 v3 Certificate Extension is:

   Extension ::= SEQUENCE {
      extnID     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ,     -- identifies extnValue syntax
      critical   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE , -- must reject if unknown
      extnValue  OCTET STRING }          -- application specific data

2.  PKI for IP Address Allocation

   A certificate will be issued to each organization that is given
   ownership of a portion of the IP address space.  This certificate is
   issued through a hierarchy of entities that, in the physical
   environment, is responsible for address allocation.  The root of this
   hierarchy is ICANN, and includes at lower layers regional address
   space allocation authorities (e.g., APNIC, ARIN, RIPE), Internet
   Service Providers (ISPs), Down Stream Providers (DSPs), and
   subscribers owning IP address prefixes.  Note, however, that address
   assignments do not have to be certified all the way to every
   subscriber.  If a subscriber's address is allocated from that of a
   DSP or an ISP with which it is currently affiliated, then the
   certification process need only be effected as far as the DSP/ISP.
   The same applies to DSPs that receive their address space assignments
   from ISPs.

   This PKI reflects the assignment of address blocks to organizations
   by binding address blocks to a public key belonging to the
   organization to whom the addresses are being assigned.  It has the
   possible drawback that this violates the "assumption" that for a
   typical X.509 certificate, the issuer is vouching for the identity of
   the subject.  Instead, these certificates will be used for proving
   ownership of a block of addresses.

   In Figure 1 below,

   (a) ICANN is the root and issues certificates to the first tier of
       organizations (Org1_x).  At present, Org1_x could be an Internet

       Registry, an ISP, an organization, etc.  ICANN signs the tier 1
       certificates using its private key.  A certificate extension is
       used to specify a list of address families and address blocks.
       The alternate name in the certificate is the DNS name of the
       organization.

   (b) Org1_x then assigns sub-blocks of its address space to ISPs,
       DSPs, etc.  In the diagram, for example, Org1_1 issues a
       certificate to each of Org2_1 through Org2_7 while Org1_N issues
       a certificate to Org2_8.  Org1_x signs the certificate using the
       private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate it
       received in (a).  The same certificate extension as in (a) is
       used to specify a list of address families and address blocks to
       be delegated to ISPs, DSP, etc.  The alternate name in the
       certificate is the DNS name of the organization.

   (c) Org2_x then assigns sub-blocks of its address space to DSPs,
       customers, etc.  In the diagram, Org2_1 issues a certificate to
       each of Org3_1 through Org3_4.  Org2_x signs the certificate
       using the private key corresponding to the public key in the
       certificate it received in (b).  The same certificate extension
       is used to specify a list of address families and address blocks
       to be delegated to organizations.  The alternate name in the
       certificate is the DNS name of the organization.

2.1.  IP Address Block Certificate Extension

   X.509 v3 Certificate Extension with OID XXX is used to bind the
   subject organization and its public key to one or more address
   prefixes.  This extension is CRITICAL since, for a given certificate,
   the certificate user must verify that all prefixes and address ranges
   present in the extension are subsets of those present in the
   certificate of the certificate authority that signed the given
   certificate.

      IPAddressRanges ::= SEQUENCE OF IPAddressRange

      IPAddressRange ::= SEQUENCE {
         addressFamily     OCTET STRING,
         addressRanges     IPAddresses } -- may be repeated

      IPAddresses ::= CHOICE {
         prefixList        [0] OCTET STRING,
         addressRange      [1] OCTET STRING }

   The type of address is specified by the addressFamily OCTET STRING.
   The values of the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and Subsequent
   Address Family Identifier (SAFI) are specified on the IANA web page
   http://www.iana.org under the "Address Family Numbers" item, or in
   [RFC1700].  The 16-bit AFI and 8-bit SAFI are encoded as three
   octets: two octets of AFI followed by a single octet of SAFI (see
   [RFC2283]).

   The addressRanges element may appear multiple times.  Each instance
   is either a list of address prefixes, or an address range specified
   by minumum and maximum address.  Both the prefixes and the minimum
   and maximum address in a range are encoded as specified in the "NLRI
   encoding" section of the BGP-4 protocol specification [RFC1771]: each
   prefix is encoded as a one-octet count of significant (left-most)
   bits (0 to 255) in the prefix, followed by as many address prefix
   octets as are required to hold that many bits.  The value of any bits
   beyond those specified in the count octet MUST be zero.  However the
   interpretation of the maximum address is that all bits beyond those
   specified in the count octet are 1s.

   Within the addressRange, the minimum and maximum addresses MUST have
   identical values for the count octet.

   The both the IPAddresses and the prefixes within the prefixList OCTET
   STRING MUST be jointly sorted in ascending order by IP address (not
   by the prefix length octet).

2.2.  Examples

      An extension that specifies net 10, i.e., 10/8 or addresses
      10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255 would be (in hexadecimal):

                  80 02  08 0A             prefixList    -- 10/8

      An extension specifying 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 and 5800::/8
      would be:

2.3.  Certification Path Verification

      During certification path verification of a certificate containing
      the IP Address Block Extension, additional processing is required.
      Each preceding certificate in the certification path must contain
      an IP Address Block Extension that contains all of the IP Address
      Block(s) in the certificate being verified, recursively, until a

      trusted certificate has been verified.

3.  PKI for Assignment of ASes and Router Associations

   Two types of certificates will be used to support the authentication
   of ASes, BGP speakers and the relationship between speakers and ASes.
   As shown in Figure 2 below, these certificates bind together:

   (a) one or more a blocks of AS numbers and an organization's public
       key -- a registry issues these to organizations and signs them
       using its private key.  The alternate name in the certificate is
       the DNS name of the organization.  An extension contains the
       (list of) AS number(s).

   (b) an AS number and its public key -- An organization owning an AS
       number issues these and signs them using the private key
       corresponding to the public key in the certificate described in
       (a).  The certificate extension containing the AS nubmer is the
       same as is used in (a).  The alternate name in the certificate is
       the DNS name of the organization.

Internet Draft     X.509 Extensions for Authorization       October 1999

   (c) a router (DNS) name, a router id, an AS number, and the router's
       public key -- An organization owning the AS number of the AS of
       the router issues these and signs them using the private key
       corresponding to the public key in the certificate described in
       (a).  Note that both the router id (an IP address) and the AS
       number are extensions in this certificate, and the binding of
       three items is a critical aspect of this certificate.  The
       alternate name in the certificate is the DNS name of the router
       corresponding to the router id.

3.1.  Autonomous System Number Extension

   X.509 v3 Certificate Extension with OID YYY is used to bind the
   subject organization and its public key to one or more Autonomous
   System Number ranges.  An Autonomous System Number is currently an
   unsigned 16-bit unsigned quantity, but may be enlarged in the future,
   e.g., IDRP Routing Domain Identifiers are 32 bits.  Each
   ASNumberRange specifies identifiers of a given signle length, which
   is specified in the itemSize element as a byte count.  Items within
   an ASNumberRange MUST be sorted in increasing numerical order.

   This extension is CRITICAL since, for a given certificate, all
   Autonomous System number ranges present in the extension must be
   subsets of those present in the certificate of the certificate
   authority that signed the given certificate.

   Each range of Autonomous System Numbers is encoded as an OCTET STRING
   with the minimum value in the range preceeding the maximum value.  If
   a single Autonomous System Number is being specified the maximum
   value is omitted from the OCTET STRING.

      ASNumberRanges ::= SEQUENCE OF ASNumberRange
      ASNumberRange ::= SEQUENCE {
         itemSize       INTEGER,        -- bytes per value
         ASNumbers      OCTET STRING }  -- min [max], may be repeated

3.1.2.  Certification Path Verification

   During certification path verification of a certificate containing
   the Autonomous System Number Extension, additional processing is
   required.  Each preceding certificate in the certification path must
   contain an Autonomous System Number Extension that contains all of
   the Autonomous System Number(s) in the certificate being verified,
   recursively, until a trusted certificate has been verified.

3.2.  Router Authorization Certificate Extension

   X.509 v3 Certificate Extension with OID ZZZ is used to bind the
   subject router (specified, e.g., by a DNS name), its public key, its
   BGP Router Identifier (currently a 32-bit IPv4 address), and the
   number of the Autonomous System of which the router is an authorized
   BGP speaker.  This extension is not CRITICAL.

   Currently, the owningASNumber OCTET STRING would have a length of two
   and the routerId OCTET STRING a length of four.

            04 04  0A 00 00 01        routerId

3.2.2.  Certification Path Verification

   During certification path verification of a certificate containing
   the Router Authorization Extension, additional processing is
   required.  The issuer's certificate must contain an Autonomous System
   Number Extension that contains the owningASNumber in one of its
   ASNumberRange elements.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification is devoted to the format and encoding of three
   extensions for X.509 certificates.  Since certificates are digitally
   signed, no additional integrity service is necessary.  Certificates
   need not be kept secret, and unrestricted and anonymous access to
   certificates and CRLs has no security implications.

   However, security factors outside the scope of this specification
   will affect the assurance provided to certificate users.  This
   section highlights critical issues that should be considered by
   implementors, administrators, and users.

   The procedures performed by CAs and RAs to validate the binding of
   the subject's identity and their public key greatly affects the
   assurance that should be placed in the certificate.  Certificate
   users may wish to review the CA's certificate practice statement to
   determine what level of assurance, if any, may be associated with the
   identity of the subject of the certificate.

   The protection afforded private keys is a critical factor in
   maintaining security.  Failure of organizations or routers to protect

   their private keys will permit an attacker to masquerade as them.

   The availability and freshness of revocation information will affect
   the degree of assurance that should be placed in a certificate.

   While certificates expire naturally, events may occur during its
   natural lifetime which negate the binding between the subject and
   either public key or the information in the extension.  If revocation
   information is untimely or unavailable, the assurance associated with
   the bindings is clearly reduced.  Similarly, implementations of the
   additional Certification Path Verification mechanisms described in
   sections 2.3, 3.1.2, and 3.3.2 that omit revocation checking provide
   less assurance than those that support it.

   Certification Path Verification depends on the certain knowledge of
   the public keys (and other information) about one or more trusted
   CAs.  The decision to trust a CA is an important decision as it
   ultimately determines the trust afforded a certificate.  The
   authenticated distribution of trusted CA public keys (usually in the
   form of a "self-signed" certificate) is a security critical out of
   band process that is beyond the scope of this specification.

   In addition, where a key compromise or CA failure occurs for a
   trusted CA, the user will need to modify the information provided to
   the Certification Path Verification routine.

   The quality of implementations that process certificates may also
   affect the degree of assurance provided.  Certification Path
   Verification relies upon the integrity of the trusted CA information,
   and especially the integrity of the public keys associated with the
   trusted CAs.  By substituting public keys for which an attacker has
   the private key, an attacker could trick the user into accepting
   false certificates.

   The binding between a key and resources specified in the certificate
   extension cannot be stronger than the cryptographic module
   implementation and algorithms used to generate the signature.
