            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93



            1.Introduction

            The past decade has witnessed the development of enterprise
            wide networks composed of a multi-vendor environment
            containing heterogeneous protocol and hardware suites.
            Organizations have become increasingly dependent on these
            enterprise networks for their daily operations.  This
            dependence has focused attention on the need for operation,
            administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) of the
            multi-vendor enterprise network on an end-to-end basis.

            1.1 Background

            This document is part of a package of ISO/CCITT and Internet
            Management Coexistence (IIMC) drafts.  Other documents
            included in this package are:

            [IIMCIMIBTRANS]     Translation of Internet MIBs to
                                ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs

            [IIMCOMIBTRANS]     Translation of ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs to
                                Internet MIBs

            [IIMCMIB-II]        Translation of Internet MIB-II to
                                ISO/CCITT GDMO MIB

            [IIMCPROXY]         ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Proxy

            These documents together comprise a package aimed at
            integrating ISO/CCITT-based and Internet-based management
            systems.  These documents represent coexistence and
            interworking efforts underway within the IIMC working group,
            chartered under the auspices of the Network Management Forum
            Architecture Integration ISO/Internet technical team.

            This work was initiated, in part, by NM Forum efforts to
            translate RFC 1214 for use with OMNIPoint 1 implementations.
            Through this effort, it became obvious that end-to-end
            management requires an integrated, unified view of the
            managed network, despite differences in management protocol
            and information structure.  Integrated management can be
            facilitated by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent service, protocol,
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.  MIB
            translation procedures can be used to support proxy
            management, as well as to take advantage of existing MIB
            definition and avoid duplication of effort. In this way,
            commercial investment in both ISO/CCITT and Internet-based
            management technologies can be preserved through deployment
            of common methods and tools which support integration.

            This overall strategy was outlined in a joint publication
            developed by the NM Forum and X/Open entitled "ISO/CCITT and


            LaBarre            Expires August 27, 1993            Page 1


            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93


            Internet Management: Coexistence and Interworking Strategy"
            [NMFMC92].  The documents included in the IIMC package are
            the next level of detailed specifications which implement
            several of the methodologies identified in the strategy.

            1.2 Overview

            The response to the need for OAM&P of enterprise networks
            has been the development of network management standards
            within various networking communities - most notably the
            ISO/CCITT and Internet communities. However, coordination of
            standards activities between these two communities has not
            occurred.  As a result, although they share a nearly common
            management model, differences in their management protocols
            and structures of management information (SMIs) have
            developed due to differing management philosophies.

            The ISO/CCITT community has developed the Common Management
            Information Protocol (CMIP) [ISO9596-1], and related SMI
            documents [ISO10165-1,2,4].  The Internet community has
            developed the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
            [RFC1157], and its successor, SNMPv2 [SNMPv2PROT]. The
            Internet SMI is defined in [RFC1155] and [SNMPv2SMI].
            Although functionally similar, the Internet and ISO/CCITT
            protocols and SMIs differ in terms of their complexity and
            specific operations.

            The focus on the need for end-to-end enterprise management
            has indicated the need to integrate the management of
            components accessed by ISO/CCITT management, Internet
            management and proprietary management mechanisms in a manner
            which presents a unified view of the network, despite
            protocol and SMI differences.  One way to integrate
            management is by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent services, protocol
            and SMI differences to create this unified view.

            A body of telecommunications and computer vendors,
            represented by organizations such as the Network Management
            Forum (NMF), and the U.S. government, as specified in the
            Government Network Management Profile (GNMP) have based
            their integrated management model on the ISO/CCITT
            management model using CMIP and the ISO/CCITT SMI.  These
            organizations are particularly interested in the development
            of proxies for devices that use the Internet management
            protocols and SMI.  Their interest is primarily due to the
            widespread commercial implementation and use of such devices
            within their enterprises, especially devices that use the
            Internet TCP/IP protocol suite.

            The proxy architecture provides emulation of CMIS services
            by mapping to the corresponding SNMP message(s) necessary to
            carry out the service request.  The service emulation allows
            management of Internet objects by an ISO/CCITT manager.  The
            left hand side of the proxy behaves like an ISO/CCITT agent,
            communicating with the ISO/CCITT manager using CMIP
            protocols.  The right hand side  of the proxy behaves like
            an Internet manager, communicating with the Internet agent
            using SNMP protocols.

            The proxy relies on the existence of a pair of directly-
            related MIB definitions, where the Internet MIB has been
            translated into ISO/CCITT GDMO using the procedures
            specified in [IIMCIMIBTRANS]. The proxy defined in
            [IIMCPROXY] uses these MIB definitions and rules to provide
            run-time translation of management information carried in
            service requests and responses.

            The proxy architecture is designed with a specified
            interface between the proxy and the underlying protocol
            stacks, and so deals primarily in terms of CMIS services and
            SNMP "services".  The proxy emulates services such as CMIS
            scoping and filtering, processing of CMIS operations, and
            forwarding/logging of CMIS notifications by performing a
            mapping process which must be tailored for each protocol
            (for example, SNMP and SNMPv2 are variants of the same
            protocol mapping process).

            In addition, [IIMCOMIBTRANS] specifies translation
            procedures
            for converting ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs into Internet MIBs.  MIBs
            generated by this translation process cannot be utilized by
            the Proxy defined in [IIMCPROXY], although another kind of
            Proxy could be defined for this purpose in the future.

            Finally, note that MIBs translated by procedures such as
            those defined by [IIMCIMIBTRANS] and [IIMCOMIBTRANS] may
            also be used without a proxy. For example, a translated MIB
            may be used to take advantage of existing MIB definitions
            when business needs require deployment in a different
            management environment. Translated MIBs may also be used to
            provide uniformity when multiple management environments are
            supported by a single system (e.g., dual stack managers).

            One of the IIMC objectives is to provide for the secure end-

            to-end management of resources managed using ISO/CCITT and
            Internet management services, protocols and SMI.  Security and
            management by their very nature are entwined such that each
            needs the services of the other.  Security services are
            required to protect management services.  Management services
            are required to monitor and control security services.

            This document defines the security architecture for end-to-
            end security between an ISO/CCITT manager and an Internet
            agent via proxies such as that defined in [IIMCPROXY]. The
            architecture requires that information required to support
            Internet security mechanisms from an end-to-end perspective,
            and to manage it, be translated into the ISO/CCITT SMI.
            This document applies the procedures described in
            [IIMCMIBTRANS] to the translation and registration of the
            Internet SNMP Parties MIB defined in [SNMPv2PARTY].

            This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
            ISO/CCITT and Internet management security services,
            protocols and mechanisms.

            This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the

            2. Security and Management Requirements

            Security and management are entwined by their very nature such
            that each needs the services of the other.  Security services
            are required to protect management services.  Management
            services are required to monitor and control security
            services.  These requirements are briefly presented in this
            section.

            2.1 Security of Management

            Management is most vulnerable to security attacks at the
            manager user interface, the communications path over which
            management messages are transmitted, and at the managed
            system that contains the resources being managed.
            Accordingly, management's security requirements are to


            LaBarre            Expires August 27, 1993            Page 5


            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93


            overcome these threats by:

                 - Preventing unauthorized operator access to manager
                 applications and associated management information
                 contained in a manager workstation,

                 - Protecting management information in transit between
                 managers and agents, and

                 - Enforcing management policy regarding access to
                 information within the managed system.

            Preventing unauthorized access to manager applications is
            beyond the scope of this document, and therefore will not be
            discussed.  The characterization of the security threats in
            relation to the other two vulnerable areas are discussed
            more fully in the following sections.

            2.2 Management of Security

            Security requires management support for three basic
            activities:

                 - monitoring and control of security mechanisms,
                 - detection of security related events through security
                   alarm generation, reporting
                   and audit trail analysis,
                 - damage assessment and recovery from a security attack.

            Security mechanisms and algorithm resources are modeled as
            managed objects and the management information is stored in
            a secure portion of the management information base.  The
            same management and security mechanisms used to manage non-
            security managed objects may be applied to the management of
            security objects.

            2.3 Threat Characterization

            Security threats for management are the same as for any
            distributed application.  Security threats can be
            characterized as being active or passive.  Active threats to
            a management system may effect changes to the state or
            operation of the managed resource.  Examples of active
            threats are malicious changes to the routing tables of a
            system, or to the objects used to control decisions related
            to policies, such as security policies relating to resource
            access.

            Active threats include:

                 -  masquerade,
                 -  modification and fabrication of messages and stored
                    data,
                 -  replay and reordering of messages, and


            LaBarre            Expires August 27, 1993            Page 6


            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93


                 -  denial of management services.

            Passive threats are those which, if realized, would not
            result in any modifications to information contained in the
            system, e.g., management information, and where neither the
            operation nor the state of the system is changed.

            Passive threats include:

                 -  disclosure of message contents and stored data,
                 -  traffic analysis, and
                 -  repudiation.

            2.3.1 Communications Path Security

            The threats to the communications path used for manager to
            agent communications, and applicable security services
            include:

                 -  modification and fabrication of management messages
                      * integrity

                 -  disclosure of management message data
                      * confidentiality, selective field confidentiality

                 -  replay and reordering of messages
                      * integrity

                 -  denial of management services
                      * continuity of operations

                 -  traffic analysis
                      * confidentiality

            Note that the communications path from the manager to an
            agent may be direct, or indirect via the management
            applications of an intermediate manager or proxy.  In the
            indirect case, the portion of the message that must be
            exposed in the intermediate manager for the purpose of
            application layer relaying is subject to unauthorized
            disclosure and modification.  Such entities must be trusted
            not to perform such modifications or to disclose the
            contents of the management messages.  Selective field
            confidentially services may be required if intermediate
            managers or proxies are acting as application layer relays
            in the path.  Such selective field services allow only the
            information in management messages required for application
            layer routing to be unprotected while preventing other
            fields in the message from disclosure or modification.

            2.3.2 Managed System Security

            The threats to the managed system include:



            LaBarre            Expires August 27, 1993            Page 7


            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93


                 -  masquerade of a manager application or operator
                      * peer authentication, data origin authentication

                 -  modification and fabrication of data residing in the
                    management information base
                      * access control, data integrity

                 -  disclosure of management data in the managed system
                      * access control, confidentiality

                 -  repudiation of management requests at the destination
                      * non-repudiation at destination.

            Non-repudiation services may be provided in circumstances
            where such accountability is required.  While the non-
            repudiation service does nothing to protect the network, it
            does provide the capability to trace the entities that are
            to be blamed for mis-management.


            3. Security Model, Requirements, and Constraints

            3.1 Security Model

            The model for IIMC end-to-end security is illustrated in
            Figure 2.  The objective is to provide continuity of
            security services from the ISO/CCITT Manager through to the
            Internet Agent.  The end-to-end solution is constrained by
            the security services available at the Internet agent and
            those available at the ISO/CCITT Manager. The mapping of
            security services is provided by the ISO/CCITT-Internet
            proxy.  The mapping of those services at the proxy will
            depend upon the availability of the services and the
            compatibility of the mechanisms used to provide the
            services.

            Figure 2 illustrates the proxy in a separate device from the
            manager or the agent.  If the proxy function is performed in
            the manager, then how the manager's internal security
            mechanisms map to Internet security services is beyond the
            scope of this document.  If ISO management services and
            protocol are provided in the managed device, and the proxy
            function is still applied, then ISO security services apply
            at the managed system.  The mapping of ISO security services
            that still apply at the internal proxy to Internet agent
            interface into equivalent Internet services, e.g.,
            authentication and access control, is beyond the scope of
            this document.

            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93


            The security services are not required to be provided at the
            same layers in the protocol suites on the two external proxy
            interfaces.  For example, integrity and confidentiality
            services may be applied at the transport or network layer at
            the interface to the ISO/CCITT manager, and at the
            application layer at the interface to the Internet agent.

            Depending on the environment, some security services may not
            be required proxy's interface to the ISO/CCITT manager.  For
            example, data origin authentication and confidentiality
            services may not be required if the two devices are close
            together and physical security is adequate to satisfy the
            security policy.

            3.2 Requirements

            The basic requirements to be met by the architecture for
            providing end-to-end security services are support for:

                 - enforcement of SNMPv1 security services at the agent
                 (community string).

                 - enforcement of SNMPv2 security services at the agent
                 (party based).

                 - optional enforcement of access control at the proxy on
                 either SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 agents.  Since SNMPv1 does not
                 support access control, this implies that SNMPv2 party
                 based access control shall be enforced at the proxy
                 for both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 agents.

                 - optional enforcement of access control at the proxy
                 using OSI access control mechanisms (ISO 10164-9) to 
                 the  ISO/CCITT managed objects derived from Internet
                 objects for all proxied agents.

                 - enforcement of access control at the proxy for MIB
                 objects and attributes defined specifically for the
                 proxy operation.

                 - OSI security services between the ISO/CCITT manager
                 and the proxy.

                 - mapping of OSI security services into Internet
                 security services, where possible, and forwarding form
                 the ISO/CCITT manager of information required Internet
                 security mechanisms.

            Draft     ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security  3/26/93


            3.3 Constraints on Mapping Security Services

            The major constraint on mapping security services is that
            there is no way that all information required for Internet
            security services can be derived from parameters provided
            with OSI security services.  The security mechanisms are
            dissimilar enough that mappings do not exist.  The result is
            that the ISO/CCITT manager must be aware of Internet
            security services used by the proxy, and transfer the
            information required for those services to operate.

            The Internet management SNMPv2 security architecture relies
            on the identification of distinct entities, called
            "parties", for peers that exchange SNMP messages
            [SNMPv2ADMIN].  Multiple parties may exist at the manager
            and at the agent.

            Each distinct SNMPv2 peer is identified by a "party
            identifier", an OID.  Associated with the party identifier
            are it's agent address, and parameters for authentication,
            integrity and confidentiality services to be used when
            communicating with other parties.  Since parties form a peer
            relationship, these security service parameters for peer
            parties must be compatible.

            The peer relationship between SNMPv2 parties is established
            via an associated "context", identified by an OID, which
            provides a means to identify constraints on valid management
            operations and associated resources (MIB objects).  The
            context also specifies whether the constraints apply to
            local resources or to remote resources via a proxy
            relationship.

            Therefore, SNMPv2 security requires that the peer parties
            and their context be identified before an SNMPv2 message
            will even be accepted by an agent - even if no security
            services are to be invoked.  Only then may data
            authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and access
            control services be invoked.

            The problem, from a decoupling perspective, is that there is
            no way that party and context information required for
            Internet security services can be derived from parameters
            provided with OSI security services.  The same concepts
            simply do not exist.  The result is that the ISO/CCITT
            manager must be aware of Internet security services used by
            the proxy, and transfer the party and context information
            required for those services to operate.

            Note, however, that the Internet has registered a set of
            default parties and contexts that cover a few basic security
            policies when communicating directly with SNMPv2 agents.
            These include: no authentication and confidentiality with
            restricted monitoring privileges; authentication (using MD5)

            without confidentiality but with full management privileges,
            and authentication(using MD5) with confidentiality using DES
            and with full management privileges.  If the ISO/CCITT
            manager specifies to the Internet agent (or proxy) which of
            these default sets of parties and contexts to use, then the
            specific parties and contexts need not be known to the
            manager.

            Editor's Note: [We could provide the capability of
            specifying the default community string, parties and
            contexts to use when the proxy communicates to agents.  This
            capability could relieve the ISO/CCITT manager from being
            aware of specific community string or party based security
            service requirements. The sets could be specified in
            attributes of the cmipsnmpProxyagent object.  In the absence
            of security parameters being provided by the ISO/CCITT
            manager, the default parties and context would be in effect.
            Of course, agents must be configured to support these sets,
            and the manager would be constrained to work within the
            limits of these sets.]


            3.4 Consequences of Requirements and Constraints

            The consequences of the constraint described in 3.3 are:

                 - the ISO/CCITT-Internet proxy shall use community
                 string and party/context information provided by the
                 ISO/CCITT manager to determine security services to be
                 invoked relative to an Internet agent.

                 - if access control mechanisms are used by the proxy on
                 behalf of Internet agents, then the security parameters
                 that would be required by the agent to enforce access
                 control shall be maintained by the proxy.  This applies
                 whether Internet or OSI access control mechanisms are
                 used.


            4. Manager to Internet Proxy Security

            OSI peer authentication services shall be supported in
            accordance with OMNIPoint 1 security specifications. [NMFSEC]

            OSI data origin authentication services shall optionally be
            supported in accordance with (TBD)

            Editor's Note: [To Be Provided.]

            Integrity services shall optionally be supported using (TBD).

            (TBD).

            Editor's Note: [The use of security services for transport
            (TLSP), network (NLSP), or the generic upper layer
            security(GULS) [ISO11586-1,2,3,4] to provide these services
            might be appropriate.]

            OSI access control services shall optionally be supported in
            accordance with [ISO10164-9].

            Internet security services shall optionally be supported as
            follows:

                 - the following privileged attribute certificate (PAC)
                 shall be used to convey Internet security parameters:

            Editor's Note: [Format is TBD.  Contents shall include party
            and context, or community string information.]


            5. Internet Proxy to Internet Agent Security

            All SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 security services shall be supported.

            Editor's Note: [Should we have conformance classes?]

            6. Party MIB

            The IIMC Party MIB is derived from the Internet Party MIB
            defined in[SNMPv2PARTY].  Adjustments have been made to the
            behavior of some elements in the MIB to accommodate SNMPv1
            community string based security.

            6.2 Object Class Definitions

            The Internet SNMP Parties MIB objects [RFC1353]are recast into
            OSI GDMO templates as defined in [ISO10165-4], and registered,
            using the procedures defined in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            The object identifier {iimcAutoTrans} is defined in
            [IIMCIMIBTRANS].

            The templates for the object classes are listed in
            alphabetical order.

            Editor's Note: [The OID fragment "iimcAutoTrans-partyMIB" will
            be resolved when the iimcAutotrans and partyMIB OID are
            allocated.]

                      !Locally held information about the MIB views
                       known to this SNMPv2 entity.

                       Each SNMPv2 context which is locally accessible
                       has a single MIB view which is defined by two
                       collections of view subtrees: the included view
                       subtrees, and the excluded view subtrees.  Every
                       such subtree, both included and excluded, is
                       defined in this table.

                       To determine if a particular object instance is in
                       a particular MIB view, compare the object
                       instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB
                       view's entries in this table.  If none match, then
                       the object instance is not in the MIB view.  If
                       one or more match, then the object instance is
                       included in, or excluded from, the MIB view
                       according to the value of viewType in the entry
                       whose value of viewSubtree has the most sub-
                       identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
                       the same number of sub-identifiers, then the
                       lexicographically greatest instance of viewType
                       determines the inclusion or exclusion.

                       An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches
                       an entry in this table when the number of sub-
                       identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                       value of viewSubtree for the entry, and each sub-
                       identifier in the value of viewSubtree matches its
                       corresponding sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-
                       identifiers match either if the corresponding bit
                       of viewMask is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if

                       they are equal.

                       Due to this 'wild card' capability, we introduce
                       the term, a 'family' of view subtrees, to refer to
                       the set of subtrees defined by a particular
                       combination of values of viewSubtree and viewMask.
                       In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in
                       viewMask, the family of view subtrees reduces to a
                       single view subtree.!;;

                       If the value of partyAuthProtocol is not
                       {snmpv1CommString} then this attribute contains an
                       encoding of the party's private authentication
                       key which may be needed to support the
                       authentication protocol.  Although the value of
                       this variable may be altered by a management
                       operation (e.g., a SNMPv2 Set-Request), its value
                       can never be retrieved by a management operation:
                       when read, the value of this variable is the zero
                       length OCTET STRING.

                       The private authentication key is NOT directly
                       represented by the value of this variable, but
                       rather it is represented according to an encoding.
                       This encoding is the bitwise exclusive-OR of the
                       old key with the new key, i.e., of the old private
                       authentication key (prior to the alteration) with
                       the new private authentication key (after the
                       alteration).  Thus, when processing a received
                       protocol Set operation, the new private
                       authentication key is obtained from the value of
                       this variable as the result of a bitwise
                       exclusive-OR of the variable's value and the old
                       private authentication key.  In calculating the
                       exclusive-OR, if the old key is shorter than the
                       new key, zero-valued padding is appended to the
                       old key.  If no value for the old key exists, a
                       zero-length OCTET STRING is used in the
                       calculation.!;;

                       Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-
                       identifier of viewSubtree, with the most

                       sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

                       Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                       the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
                       determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
                       family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an

                                    the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to
                                    the i-th sub-identifier of the value of

                       there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
