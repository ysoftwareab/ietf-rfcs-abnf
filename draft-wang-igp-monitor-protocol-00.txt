Abstract 

   This document proposes a protocol named IMP, which can be used for 
   monitoring IGP routing protocol. Compared to the widely used packets 
   catch and route listening method, this protocol is more convenient 
   for obtaining routing information and capturing routing changes, can 
   well satisfy network routing monitoring and research purpose.

1. Introduction 

   Routing protocol is used to direct IP packet forwarding. The quality 
   and usability of IP network is depend on routing protocol's

   correctness, so, monitor the status of routing protocol, diagnose 
   routing fault and recovery fault as fast as possible are important 
   to IP network O&M. 

   When link has fault or change, routing changing can spread 
   automatically till routing convergence to a new usable path. When a 
   new router linked to existing network, router's information and new 
   import routing information can spread to whole network automatically, 
   at the same time, the new router can get other router's routing 
   information also. These features simplifies configuration and 
   deployment of network extraordinarily, but meanwhile, introduce the 
   uncertainty of service flow path, make operator hard to know the 
   route of service , they can't make sure whether IP packet is 
   forwarding or not, all of this make network fault locate more and 
   more difficulty. 

2. Problem statement 

   Routing abnormity monitoring and service path detecting are hot 
   topic in route management area. 

   As for routing abnormity monitoring, there is no any router and 
   SNMP-based management system can well meet customer's requirement. 

   As for path detecting, usually use ping and traceroute tools. Ping 
   can detect the connectivity from one router to another given IP 
   address. Traceroute can detect the hop by hop information of given 
   IP address peer. These tools have some disadvantages such as, 

     1   May get invalid path at route convergence period 

     2   Can only support fault locating on spot, but can't support 
          off-line fault diagnosis, and what's more, can't provide 
          history change information of service path, so it is hard to 
          locate service's instantaneous fault. 

     3   Can't discover ECMP paths, so the operator has to take lots of 
          time to analysis routing table for estimating service off-load 
          status. 

     4   Help to locate fault manually ,but it is low-efficiency, can't 
          well satisfy automatic fault location requirement.

   There has some works done on route monitoring and path discovering 
   now, aim to overcome these disadvantages, typical solution is using 
   collector to establish OSPF/ISIS routing neighborhood to deployed 
   routers. It utilize router's flooding mechanism to collect route 
   information, then can detect routing abnormity by analysing routing 
   information actively, and calculate required IP path by simulating 
   router's path calculation process. 

   Using route analysis system to collect route update message is use 
   for routing monitor and path discovery, but the use of listener is 
   also have some disadvantages: 

     1  As for establishing route neighborhood between listener and 
        router ,the router can't tell the difference between listener 
        peer and router peer, so there is no chance for the listened 
        router to take suitable priority level of processing for its 
        different type of peers. Another question is security issue, 
        incorrect listener may import unexpected route update to network. 

     2  When network has many Areas, listener has to establish 
        neighborhood to each OSPF/ISIS route Ares at least one, because 
        OSPF/ISIS neighborhood can't across other routes, it needs 
        deploy one listener for every Area. The management cost and 
        hardware cost is high because it needs deploy so many listeners. 
        Another solution is using IP Tunnel cross IP network to 
        establish remote route neighbor session, but its configuration 
        cost and maintenance cost is high, and besides, during route 
        convergence process , it have chance to collect insufficient 
        messages due to path dis-connectivity. 

     3  Needs hard listener device, and occupy precise router's physical 
        ports. When listen VRF route instance, in extreme situation, PE 
        router may needs support port to communicate with listener for 
        each VRF. But in Metro and Access network , there is many small

        and insulated route Areas, because remote ISIS/OSPF peer is not 
        always available, so needs more listener device, it is make the 
        hardware cost more high. 

     4  Complicated and discommodious deployment. Need go to scene to 
        deploy listener and configure route peer in related routers. 
        When needs to adjust the position of listener, it needs repeat 
        the process above. 
        

   The IGP monitoring protocol is a simplified and effective route 
   monitoring solution, it is include two parts: 

     1  Routing collection: implement by router and monitoring system, 
        the router packed LSDB and the update information as OSPF/ISIS 
        protocol message format and send to listener system. 

     2  Routing analysis: implement on monitoring system. Receive route 
        update message from routers, detect route abnormity, calculate 
        IP path. 
   This solution can satisfied route message collection and monitoring 
   requirement excellently, and not import performance effect on 
   router's other task. 

    

3. IMP Protocol 

3.1. IMP Session 

   IMP is a connection-oriented protocol, it is composed of client and 
   server. Server is deployed in router; Client is deployed in 
   monitoring system. 

   IMP message transport is based on TCP. Router listened at a given 
   port, monitoring system establish connection to router via this port. 

   After TCP connection established, Router send an open message to 
   monitoring system, the message will take a session-keep time. When 
 
 
Wang, et al.            Expires July 4, 2011                  [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft                   I                       January 2011 
    

   Monitoring system receives open message, it check the parameters in 
   this message, if this open message is acceptable, monitoring system 
   send a keep alive message to router to acknowledge open message, 
   hereto, the connection has established, then can send Route 
   Monitoring, Statistic Report and keep alive messages. 

   Keep alive message is sent at 1/3(but can't less than one second) of 
   hold-time, if negotiated hold-time is ZERO, it means needs not to 
   send keep alive message. 

   If there is any abnormity occurs, it just needs to simply drop the 
   connection. 

3.2. Route Report 

   Route report is aimed to obtain router's LSDB data, include initial 
   synchronization message and real-time update. 

   After IMP connection is established, router initiates the first 
   initial synchronization by send a route report message which 
   encapsulates a snapshot of LSDB to monitoring system. Meanwhile, 
   router start real-time listen, when LSDB have change, it sends route 
   report message to monitoring system immediately. 

   Router need to judge whether send route report message to monitoring 
   system or not, the principle is the same as send link state update 
   message to IGP neighbor. The difference between them is that the 
   router needs not to send period audit check messages(such as ISIS 
   CSNP) and period link state updates (that is, the link state 
   advertisements with only sequence number and remaining lifetime 
   change) to IMP peer. i.e., as for LSA/LSP that router sends to its 
   IGP neighbors, if there has route message change, route send a copy 
   to IMP peer as IMP message format. 

   Route report is not a real-time copy of LSA/LSP message. As for IMP 
   route message, packet sending many be delayed due to routing busy, 
   but at the condition of not effect route convergence and route 
   calculation, routes need to notify monitoring system as soon as 
   possible. So, these is delay between route receive LSA/LSP and 
   create and send to monitoring system. If the link state changed 
   again during this period, the router should try to transfer every 
   time link state changes to the monitoring system, but also allows 
   the router to send directly the final state to the monitoring system.

3.3. Statistics Report 

   The purpose of statistics report is to monitor interesting events 
   occur on router or some concerned packet counters. Following 
   statistic types are pre-defined: Number of the received link state 
   advertisements with invalid check sum, Number of duplicate link 
   state advertisements received from the same peer. Statistic types 
   can be expanded as needed. 

   The IMP implementation can both report statistics periodically or 
   immediately. It is not limited. However, configuration control of 
   the timer and/or threshold values should be provided. 

3.4. Multiple routing instances support 

   Routers may support multiple routing instances. LSDB between routing 
   instances are independent, typically example VRF. 

   One IMP instance can simultaneously monitor multiple routing 
   instances. IMP message carries an identifier of the routing instance 
   to separate routing information that belong to different routing 
   instances. 

4. Message Format 

4.1. IMP Header 

   IMP header appears in all IMP messages. The rest of the data depends 
   on the "Message Type" field in the IMP header. 

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Version (1 byte) IMP protocol version, the current version is '1'. 

   Message Length (2 bytes): Length of the whole message in bytes, 
   including headers and data. 

   Message Type (1 byte): Type of the IMP message. The IMP client MUST 
   ignore unrecognized message types when received.

             Type = 3: Statistics Report (SR) 
    
4.2. Routing Instance Header 

   The routing instance header follows the IMP header for most IMP 
   messages except ''Open'' and ''Keep Alive'' messages. The rest of the 
   data depends on the ''Message Type'' field in the IMP header and the 
   ''Protocol Type'' field in the routing instance header.

   Protocol Type (1 byte): Indicates the routing protocol type of the 
   data following the routing instance header in the route report 
   messages and statistics report messages. 

   - Type = 0: OSPF 

   - Type = 1: ISIS 

   Instance Type (1 byte): Routers may have multiple routing instances 
   (example L3VPNs). This field is used to indicate the type of the 
   routing instance which the routing data following the routing 
   instance header belongs to. 

   - Type = 0: Global Instance 

   - Type = 1: L3VPN Instance 

   Distinguisher Length(1 byte) Length of instance distinguisher in

   Instance Distinguisher: This field is used to distinguish routing 
   instances from each other.  

   For a ''Global Instance'', this field is set to null, correspondingly 
   the ''Distinguisher Length'' field is set to zero. For a ''L3VPN 
   Instance'', it is set to route distinguisher of the particular L3VPN 
   instance that the routing data belongs to. 

   Routing Identifier 4 bytes  Identifier used by routing protocol to 
   separate different routing domains in router. It can be router ID 
   for OSPF, or system ID for ISIS. 

   Timestamp: The time when the routes were received by the router, it 
   is used for the monitoring system to know when the route change 
   happened. This field expressed in seconds and microseconds since 
   midnight (zero hour), January 1, 1970 (UTC). If zero, the time is 
   unavailable. Precision of the timestamp depends on implementation. 

4.3. Open Message 

   Open message is the first message after the session is established.  

   Following the IMP header is a 2-byte field that indicates the hold 
   time of the session in seconds. 

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

   Hold Time 2 bytes   This field is used to indicate the expected 
   session hold time in seconds, the receiver either accepts the time 
   value, or reject the connection. 

4.4. Keep Alive Message 

   Keep alive messages have only the IMP header, does not contain any 
   other data. 

   If the ''Hold Time'' in the open message is set to zero, keep alive 
   messages are not needed. 

4.5. Route Report Message 

   Route Report messages are used for initial synchronization and real-
   time monitoring of LSDB.

   Following the IMP header and routing instance header is an OSPF or 
   ISIS PDU, depends on the ''Protocol Type'' field in the routing 
   instance header. 

4.6. Statistics Report Message 

   This message is used to help the monitoring system to observe 
   interesting events that happen on the router. 

   Following the IMP header and routing instance header is a 4-byte 
   field that indicates the number of counters in the statistics report 
   message where each counter is encoded as a TLV.
