Abstract
This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-
independent Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to Internet email-based
transports. Calendaring entries defined by the iCalendar Object Model
[ICAL] are composed using constructs from [RFC-822], [RFC-2045], [RFC-
2046], [RFC-2047], [RFC-2048] and [RFC-2049].

This document is based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined
by [ICMS].

This document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group.
More information about the IETF CALSCH working group activities can be
found on the IMC web site at http://www.imc.org, the IETF web site at

Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                             March 13, 1998

1.1 Related Memos

Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
scheduling standards.

This document - specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP].

[ICMS] - specifies a common terminology and abstract;

[ICAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
properties and property parameters;

[ITIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling between
different implementations;

[IRIP] - specifies an Internet real time protocol binding for [ITIP].

This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are made
to the memo that provides for the specification of these concepts or
definitions.


1.2 Formatting Conventions

The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose. In order to
refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
or interoperability protocol defined in [ICMS], [ICAL] and [ITIP] some
formatting conventions have been used.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

Calendaring and scheduling roles described by [ICMS] are referred to in
quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper
case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User"
within the scheduling protocol defined by [ITIP].

Calendar components defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start with the letter
"V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component,
"VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to
the daily journal calendar component.

Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for
requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified,
"REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update
their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.

Properties defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-
strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          3             Expires September 1998


Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                             March 13, 1998

"ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey the
calendar address of a calendar user.

Property parameters defined by [ICAL] are referred to with lower case,
quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "parameter". For example,
"value" parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to
override the default data type for a property value.


1.3 Terminology

The email terms used in this memo are defined in [RFC-822] and [RFC-
2045]. The calendaring and scheduling terms used in this memo are
defined in [ICMS], [ICAL] and [ITIP].


2  MIME Message Format Binding

This section defines the message binding to the MIME electronic mail
transport.

The sections below refer to the "originator" and the "respondent" of an
iMIP message. Typically, the originator is the "Organizer" of an event.
The respondent is an "Attendee" of the event.

The Reply-To header typically contains the email address of the
originator or respondent of an event. However, this cannot be guaranteed
as Mail User Agents (MUA) are not required to enforce iMIP semantics.


2.1 MIME Media Type

A MIME entity containing content information formatted according to this
document will be referenced as a "text/calendar" content type. It is
assumed that this content type will be transported through a MIME
electronic mail transport.


2.2 Security

This section addresses several aspects of security including
Authentication, Authorization and Confidentiality. Authentication and
confidentiality can be achieved using [RFC-1847] that specifies the
Security Multiparts for MIME. This framework defines new content types
and subtypes of multipart: signed and encrypted. Each contains two body
parts: one for the protected data and another for the control
information necessary to remove the protection.


2.2.1     Authorization

In [ITIP] messages, only the "Organizer" is authorized to modify or
cancel calendar entries they organize. That is, spoof@xyz.com is not
allowed to modify or cancel a meeting that was organized by


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          4             Expires September 1998


Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                             March 13, 1998

a@example.com. Furthermore, only the respondent has the authorization to
indicate their status to the "Organizer". That is, the "Organizer" must
ignore an [ITIP] message from spoof@xyz.com that declines a meeting
invitation for b@example.com.

IMIP implementations SHOULD verify the authenticity of the sender of an
iCalendar object before taking any action.

ITIP message flow supports someone working on behalf of a "Calendar
User" through use of the "sent-by" parameter which is associated with
the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties. However, there is no
mechanism to verify whether or not a "Calendar User" has authorized
someone to work on their behalf. It is left to implementations to
provide mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to make that decision.


2.2.2     Authentication

Authentication can be performed using an implementation of [RFC-1847]
Multipart/signed that supports public/private key certificates.
Authentication is possible only on messages that have been signed.
Authenticating an unsigned message may not be reliable.


2.2.3     Confidentiality

To ensure confidentiality using iMIP implementations should utilize
[RFC-1847] compliant encryption. The protocol does not restrict a CUA
from forwarding Requests or Responses to other users or agents.


2.3 RFC-822 Addresses

The calendar address specified within the "ATTENDEE" property in an
iCalendar object MUST be a fully qualified, RFC-822 address
specification for the corresponding "Organizer" or "Attendee" of the
"VEVENT" or "VTODO".

Because [ITIP] does not preclude "Attendees" from forwarding "VEVENTS"
or "VTODOS" to others, the [RFC-822] "Sender" value may not equal that
of the "Organizer". Additionally, the "Organizer" or  "Attendee" cannot
be reliably inferred by the [RFC-822] "Sender" or "Reply-to" values of
an IMIP message.  The relevant address MUST be ascertained by opening
the "text/calendar" MIME body part and examining the "ATTENDEE" and
"ORGANIZER" properties.


2.4 Content Type

A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this
document MUST have a Content-Type value of "text/calendar". The content
type header field must also include the type parameter "method". The
value MUST be the same as the value of the "METHOD" calendar property
within the iCalendar object. This means that a MIME message containing


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          5             Expires September 1998


Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                             March 13, 1998

multiple iCalendar objects with different method values must be further
encapsulated with a "multipart/mixed" MIME entity. This will allow each
of the iCalendar objects to be encapsulated within their own
"text/calendar" MIME entity.

A CHARSET parameter MUST be present when the "text/calendar" is used.
[RFC-2046] discusses the selection of an appropriate CHARSET value.

The optional Content-Type COMPONENT parameter defines the iCalendar
component type contained within the iCalendar object.

The following is an example of this header field with a value that
indicates an event message.


        Content-Type:text/calendar; method=request; charset=UTF-8;
              component=vevent

The "text/calendar" content type allows for the scheduling message type
to be included in a MIME message with other content information (i.e.,
multipart/mixed) or included in a MIME message with a clear-text, human-
readable form of the scheduling message (i.e., multipart/alternative).

In order to permit the information in the scheduling message to be
understood by MIME user agents (UA) that do not support the
text/calendar content type, scheduling messages SHOULD be sent with an
alternative, human-readable form of the information.


2.5 Content-Transfer-Encoding

Note that the default character set for iCalendar objects is UTF-8. A
transfer encoding SHOULD be used for iCalendar objects containing any
characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set.


2.6 Content-Disposition

The handling of a MIME part should be based on its "Content-Type".
However, this is not guaranteed to work in all environments.  Some
environments handle MIME attachments based on their file type or
extension. To operate correctly in these environments, implementations
may wish to include a "Content-Disposition" property to define a file
name.



3  Security Considerations

[ITIP] details the security threats that applications must address when
implementing ITIP.  Two spoofing threats are identified:  Spoofing the
"Organizer", and Spoofing an "Attendee". To address these threats, the
originator of an iCalendar object must be authenticated by a recipient.
Once authenticated, a determination can be made as to whether or not the


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          6             Expires September 1998


Internet DraftiCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)
                             March 13, 1998

originator is authorized to perform the requested operation. Compliant
applications MUST support signing and encrypting text/calendar
attachments using a mechanism based on Security Multiparts for MIME
[RFC1847] to facilitate the authentication the originator of the
iCalendar object. Implementations MAY provide a means for users to
disable signing and encrypting.  The steps are described below:

1. The iCalendar object must be signed by the "Organizer" sending an
update or the "Attendee" sending a reply.

2.  Using the RFC1847-compliant security mechanism, determine who signed
the iCalendar object. This is the "signer". Note that the signer is not
necessarily the person sending an e-mail message.  An e-mail message can
be forwarded.

3. Correlate the "signer" to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar
object.  If the signer cannot be correlated to an "ATTENDEE" property,
ignore the message.

4. Determine whether or not the "ATTENDEE" is authorized to perform the
operation as defined by [ITIP]. If the conditions are not met, ignore
the message.

5. If all the above conditions are met, the message can be processed.

To address the confidentiality security threats, signed IMIP messages
SHOULD be encrypted by a mechanism based on Security Multiparts for MIME
[RFC1847].

It is possible to receive IMIP messages sent by someone working on
behalf of another "Calendar User". This is determined by examining the
"sent-by" parameter in the relevant "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" property.
[ICAL] and [ITIP] provide no mechanism to verify that a "Calendar User"
has authorized someone else to work on their behalf.  To address this
security issue, implementations MUST provide mechanisms for the
"Calendar Users" to make that decision before applying changes from
someone working on behalf of a "Calendar User".
