         This document describes the  org.ietf.sip.call extensions
         to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The document
         also describes how standard telephony services can be
         implemented in SIP.

1 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations.

2 Introduction

   This document describes the  org.ietf.sip.call extensions to the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2]. When using the extensions

   general header, "*": needed if message body is not empty.  A  numeric
   value in the "type" column indicates the status code the header field
   is used with.


3.1  Accept-Location

   The  Accept-Location request header allows the caller to provide
   hints to proxy and redirect servers. It uses the same parameters as
   the Location header (Section 3.4).

3.2  Also

   The  Also request and response header advises the recipient to issue
   INVITE requests to the addresses listed. Each of these invitations
   SHOULD contain a  Requested-By header that contains the  From field
   of the message containing the  Also field. The  Also header MUST only
   be processed by the calling or called user agent, not by any
   intermediate proxy or redirect servers.

   If a message contains both  Also and  Replaces, the invitations
   requested in the  Also header MUST be completed, successfully or not,
   before the terminations requested in the Replaces header.


   Also    =    "Also" ":" 1#( SIP-URL | URI ) [ comment ]

   Example header:


     Also: sip://jones@foo.com, sip://mueller@bar.edu



   If A, B and C are end points, the following is a typical scenario:


   A -> B:    INVITE B SIP/2.0
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              Also: C
              From: A
   B -> A:    SIP/2.0 200 OK
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: A
   B -> C:    INVITE C SIP/2.0
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: B
              Requested-By: A
   C -> B:    SIP/2.0 200 OK
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: B


   If G is a group address with members X through Z, a group invitation
   may proceed as follows:


   A -> G:    INVITE G SIP/2.0
              From: A
              Call-ID: 19971214T124523.00@A

   G -> A:    SIP/2.0 200 OK
              From: A
              Call-ID: 19971214T124523.00@A
              Also: X, Y, Z

   A -> X:    INVITE X SIP/2.0
              From: A
              Call-ID: 19971214T124523.00@A
              Requested-By: G

   A -> Y:    INVITE Y SIP/2.0
              From: A
              Call-ID: 19971214T124523.00@A
              Requested-By: G

Internet Draft              SIP Call Control              March 13, 1998



   A -> Z:    INVITE Z SIP/2.0
              From: A
              Call-ID: 19971214T124523.00@A
              Requested-By: G



        The  Also header makes it possible to create full meshes
        (generalized "three-way" calling) and supports the
        resolution of group addresses. Unlike the  Location header,
        which enumerates alternatives to be tried, the  Also header
        lists addresses to be all invited.

3.3  Call-Disposition

   The  Call-Disposition request header field allows the client to
   indicate how the server is to handle the call. The following options
   can be used singly or in combination:

   all: If the user part of the SIP request address identifies a group
        rather than an individual, the " all" feature indicates to a
        proxy or redirect server that it should resolve the address to a
        list of group members and return a 300 (Multiple Choices)
        response. The list of group members is contained in an  Also
        header.

   do-not-forward: The "do-not-forward" request prohibits proxies from
        forwarding the call to another individual (e.g., the call is
        personal or the caller does not want to be shunted to a
        secretary if the line is busy.)

   queue: If the called party is temporarily unreachable, e.g., because
        it is in another call, the caller can indicate that it wants to
        have its call queued rather than rejected immediately. If the
        call is queued, the server returns "181 Queued" (see Section
        4.1). A pending call be terminated by a SIP  BYE request.

   do-not-respond: The  do-not-respond directive indicates to the callee
        that it should not issue a response, informational or final.
        This may be used to send invitations to multicast groups.


        Maybe the combination of do-not-respond and all could be
        used for group invitations to larger lists?


   Call-Disposition    =    "Call-Disposition" ":" 1#( "all" | "do-not-forward"

   Example:

     Call-Disposition: all, do-not-forward, queue



3.4  Location

   This document adds extension parameters to the  Location header.


   extension-name       =    token
   extension-value      =    *( token | quoted-string | LWS | extension-specials)
   extension-specials   =     < any element of  tspecials except <"> >
   language-tag         =    <  see [H3.10] >
   priority-tag         =    "urgent" | "normal" | "non-urgent"
   service-tag          =    "fax" | "IP" | "PSTN" | "ISDN" | "pager"
   media-tag            =    Internet media type [ "/" subtype ]
   feature-list         =    "voice-mail" | "attendant" | "permanent"




        extension-attribute   |    "class"          "="    ( "personal" | "business" )
                              |    "description"    "="    quoted-string
                              |    "duplex"         "="    ( "full" | "half" |
                                                           "receive-only" | "send-only" )
                              |    "features"       "="    1# feature-list
                              |    "language"       "="    1# language-tag
                              |    "media"          "="    1# media-tag
                              |    "mobility"       "="    ( "fixed" | "mobile" )
                              |    "priority"       "="    1# priority-tag
                              |    "service"        "="    1# service-tag


   class: The class parameter indicates whether this terminal is found
        in a residential or business setting. (A caller may defer a
        personal call if only a business line is available, for
        example.)

   description: The description field further describes, as text, the
        terminal. It is expected that the user interface will render
        this text.

   duplex: The duplex parameter lists whether the terminal can



Schulzrinne/Rosenberg                                         [Page 5]

Internet Draft              SIP Call Control              March 13, 1998


        simultaneously send and receive ("full"), alternate between
        sending and receiving ("half"), can only receive ("receive-
        only") or only send ("send-only"). Typically, a caller will
        prefer a full-duplex terminal over a half-duplex terminal and
        these over receive-only or send-only terminals.

   features: The feature list enumerates additional features of this
        address. The "permanent" flag indicates that this address is a
        new, permanent address. When used for registration, the server
        SHOULD return a 301 status instead of 302.

   language: The language parameter lists, in order of preference, the
        languages spoken by the person answering. This feature may be
        used to have a caller automatically select the appropriate
        attendant or customer service representative, without having to
        declare its own language skills.

   media: The media tag lists the media types supported by the terminal.
        Media types can be the standard Internet media types ("audio",
        "video", "text", "application"), optionally followed by a
        subtype (e.g., "text/html"). In addition, the type
        "application/email" is defined.

   mobility: The mobility parameter indicates if the terminal is fixed
        or mobile. In some locales, this may affect voice quality or
        charges.

   priority: The priority tag indicates the minimum priority level this
        terminal is to be used for. It can be used for automatically
        restricting the choice of terminals available to the user.

   service: The service tag describes what service is being provided by
        the terminal.

   Attributes which are unknown should be omitted. New tags for class-
   tag and  service-tag can be registered with IANA.  The media tag uses
   Internet media types, e.g., audio, video, application/x-wb. This is
   meant for indicating general communication capability, sufficient for
   the caller to choose an appropriate address.

   A 301 or 302 response MAY contain additional information in human-
   readable form, e.g., as  Content-Type: text/html. It is up to the
   server issuing the  Location header to ensure consistency between the
   content of the  Location header and the response entity.

3.5  Replaces

   The  Replaces request and response header is analogous to the Also
   header (Section 3.2, except that it asks the recipient to issue a
   BYE to the addresses listed, with the same Call-ID as the request
   containing the  Replaces header.  The special address "*" indicates
   that the recipient should replace all existing legs of the call
   within the  Call-ID. If a message contains both  Also and  Replaces,
   the invitations requested in the  Also header MUST be completed,
   successfully or not, before the terminations requested in the
   Replaces header.

   For example, with entities A, B and M (an MCU):


   A -> B:    INVITE B SIP/2.0
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: A

   B -> A:    SIP/2.0 200 OK
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: A

   M -> B:    INVITE B SIP/2.0
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: M
              Replaces: *

   B -> M:    SIP/2.0 200 OK
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A

              From: M

   B -> A:    BYE A SIP/2.0
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: B
              Requested-By: M

   A -> B:    SIP/2.0 200 OK
              Call-ID: 19971214T123503.33@A
              From: A


3.6  Requested-By

   The  Requested-By request header is only used in requests triggered
   by  Also or  Replaces. It contains the URI of the entity that issued
   the request containing the  Also header. The URI is taken from the
   From header of the request. For example, if A sends an invitation to
   B containing  Also: C, B issues an invitation to C with  Requested-
   By: A.

4 Status Code Definitions

   This feature set defines one additional status code.

4.1 181 Queued

   The called party was temporarily unavailable, but the caller
   indicated via a "Call-Disposition: Queue" directive (Section 3.3) to
   queue the call rather than reject it. When the callee becomes
   available, it will return the appropriate final status response. The
   reason phrase MAY give further details about the status of the call,
   e.g., "5 calls queued; expected waiting time is 15 minutes". The
   server may issue several 181 responses to update the caller about the
   status of the queued call.

5 ISDN and Intelligent Network Services

   SIP may be used to support a number of ISDN [4] and Intelligent
   Network [5] telephony services, described below. Due to the
   fundamental differences between Internet-based telephony and
   conferencing as compared to public switched telephone network
   (PSTN)-based services, service definitions cannot be precisely the
   same.  Where large differences beyond addressing and location of
   implementation exist, this is indicated below. The term address
   implies any SIP address.

   This section is for information and illustration only. There are many



Schulzrinne/Rosenberg                                         [Page 8]

Internet Draft              SIP Call Control              March 13, 1998


   different ways of implementing services in SIP. Since SIP only
   describes the behavior induced by messages, different means of
   implementing services will interoperate.

5.1 Call Redirection and "Number"-Translation Services

   Call transfer (TRA) enables a user to transfer an established (i.e.,
        active) call to a third party. SIP signals this via the Location
        header in the  BYE method.

   Call forwarding (CF) permits the called user to forward particular
        pre-selected calls to another address. Unlike telephony, the
        choice of calls to be forwarded depends on program logic
        contained in any of the SIP servers and can thus be made
        dependent on time-of-day, subject of call, media types, urgency
        or caller identity, rather than being restricted to matching
        list entries. This forwarding service encompasses:

   Call forwarding busy/don't answer (CFB/CFNR, SCF-BY/DA) allows the
        called user to forward particular pre-selected calls if the
        called user is busy or does not answer within a set time.

   Selective call forwarding (SCF) permits the user to have her incoming
        calls addressed to another network destination, no matter what
        the called party status is, if the calling address is included
        in, or excluded from, a screening list. The user's originating
        service is unaffected.

   Destination call routing (DCR) allows customers to specify the
        routing of their incoming calls to destinations according to

        - time of day, day of week, etc.;

        - area of call origination;

        - network address of caller;

        - service attributes;

        - priority (e.g., from input of a PIN or password);

        - charge rates applicable for the destination;

        - proportional routing of traffic.

   In SIP, destination call routing is implemented by user agents, proxy
   and redirect servers that implement custom call handling logic, with
   parameters including, but not limited to the set listed above. Caller

   preferences are expressed in the  Accept-Location header, callee
   preferences in the  Location header.

   Follow-me diversion (FMD) allows the service subscriber to remotely
        control the redirection (diversion) of calls from his primary
        network address to other locations.

   In SIP, finding the current network-reachable location of a callee is
   left to the location service and is outside the scope of this
   specification. However, users may use the  REGISTER method to
   appraise their "home" SIP server of their new location.

   Universal access number (UAN) allows a subscriber with several
        network addresses to be reached with a single, unique address.
        The subscriber may specify which incoming calls are to be routed
        to which address. SIP offers this functionality through proxies
        and redirection.

   Universal personal telecommunications (UPT) is a mobility service
        which enables subscribers to be reached with a unique personal
        telecommunication number (PTN) across multiple networks at any
        network access. The PTN will be translated to an appropriate
        destination address for routing based on the capabilities
        subscribed to by each service subscriber. A person may have
        multiple PTNs, e.g., a business and private PTN. In SIP, a
        host-independent address of the form user@domain serves as the
        PTN, which is translated into one or more host-dependent
        addresses.

5.2 Camp-on

   Completion of calls to busy subscriber (CCBS) allows a calling user
   encountering a busy destination to be informed when the busy
   destination becomes free, without having to make a new call attempt.
   SIP supports services close to CCBS by allowing a callee to indicate
   a more opportune time to call back with the  Retry-After header.
   Also, calling and called user agents can easily record the URI of
   outgoing and incoming calls, so that a user can re-try or return
   calls with a single mouse click or automatically.  Call-Disposition:
   queue allows a caller to wait until the line becomes available. This
   service is also known as a "camp-on" service.

5.3 Call Screening

   Originating call screening (OCS) controls the ability of a node to
   originate calls. In a fashion similar to closed user groups, a
   firewall would have to be used to restrict the ability to initiate
   SIP invitations outside a designated part of the network. In many

Internet Draft              SIP Call Control              March 13, 1998


   cases, gateways to the PSTN will require appropriate authentication.

5.4 Directed Call Pickup

   Directed call pickup allows a station user to answer calls directed
   to a specific address from any other address by providing the address
   of the line to be answered. The rung station must permit pickup. If
   the call has not been answered at the ringing station, regular call
   pickup occurs. If the call has been answered already, an error is
   generated.

5.5 Directed Call Pickup with Barge-In

   Directed call pickup with barge-in establishes a 3-way call if the
   call has been answered at the original destination.

5.6 Outgoing Call Routing

   User-defined routing (UDR) allows a subscriber to specify how
   outgoing calls, from the subscriber's location, shall be routed. SIP
   cannot specify routing preferences; this is presumed to be handled by
   a policy-based routing protocol, source routing or similar
   mechanisms.  However, the SIP  Accept-Location header may be used by
   proxies and redirect servers to route calls according to caller
   preferences.

5.7 End-System Services

   Some telephony services can be provided by the end system, without
   involvement by SIP:

   Abbreviated dialing allows users to reach local subscribers without
        specifying the full address (domain or host name). For SIP, the
        user application completes the address to be a fully qualified
        domain name.

   Call waiting (CW) allows the called party to receive a notification
        that another party is trying to reach her while she is busy
        talking to another calling party.

   For SIP-based telephony, the called party can maintain several call
   presences at the same time, limited by local resources. Thus, it is
   up to the called party to decide whether to accept another call. The
   separation of resource reservation and call control may lead to the
   situation that the called party accepts the incoming call, but that
   the network or system resource allocation fails. This cannot be
   completely prevented, but if the likely resource bottleneck is at the
   local system, the user agent may be able to determine whether there

   are sufficient resources available or roughly track its own resource
   consumption.

   Consultation calling (COC) allows a subscriber to place a call on
        hold, in order to initiate a new call for consultation. In
        systems using SIP, consultation calling can be implemented as
        two separate SIP calls, possibly with the temporary release of
        reserved resources for the call being put on hold.

   Customized ringing (CRG) allows the subscriber to allocate a
        distinctive ringing to a list of calling parties. In a SIP-based
        system, this feature is offered by the user application, based
        on caller identification ( From header) provided by the SIP
        INVITE request.

   Malicious call identification (MCI) allows the service subscriber to
        control the logging (making a record) of calls received that are
        of a malicious nature. In SIP, by default, all calls identify
        the calling party and the SIP servers that have forwarded the
        call. In addition, calls may be authenticated using standard
        HTTP methods or transport-layer security. A callee may decide
        only to accept calls that are authenticated.

   Multiway calling (MWC) allows the user to establish multiple,
        simultaneous calls with other parties. For a SIP-based end
        system, the considerations for consultation calling apply.

   Terminating call screening (TCS) allows the subscriber to specify
        that incoming calls either be restricted or allowed, according
        to a screening list and/or by time of day or other parameters.

5.8 Billing Features

   Billing features such as account card dialing , automatic alternative
   billing , credit card calling (CCC) , reverse charging , freephone
   (FPH) , premium rate (PRM) and split charging are supported through
   authentication. However, mechanisms for indicating billing
   preferences and capabilities have not yet been specified for SIP.

   Advice of charge allows the user paying for a call to be informed of
   usage-based charging information. Charges incurred by reserving
   resources in the network are probably best indicated by a protocol
   closely affiliated with the reservation protocol. Advice of charge
   when using Internet-to-PSTN gateways through SIP appears feasible,
   but is for further study. Desirable facilities include indication of
   charges at call setup time, during the call and at the end of the
   call

   Closed user groups (CUGs) that restrict members to communicate only
   within the group can be implemented using firewalls and SIP proxies.

5.9 User-to-User Signaling

   User-to-user signaling is supported within SIP through the addition
   of headers, with predefined header fields such as  Subject or
   Organization.

5.10 Operator Services

   There are a number of services which involve three parties, for
   example, a secretary dialing for boss, an auto-dialer handing a call
   to a telemarketer, attended call transfer, operator services such as
   person-to-person calls and full-mesh "multicast".

   Operator services can be implemented in a number of ways, combining
   Also,  Replaces with either  INVITE or  BYE. The callee's end system
   does not have to be cognizant of the fact that this an operator
   service. The services make use of the  Call-ID rules that stipulate
   that a new  INVITE for an existing  Call-ID does not alert the user,
   but is added silently.

   Figure 1 shows the example of an autodialer connecting to a
   prospective customer and, once the callee picks up, transfering the
   call to the telemarketer. (This goes to show that SIP is morally
   neutral.)

5.11 Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) Services

   In the language of IN services, SIP supports:

   Conferencing (CON) allows the user to communicate simultaneously with
        multiple parties, which may also communicate among themselves.
        SIP can initiate IP multicast conferences with any number of
        participants, conferences where media are mixed by a conference
        bridge (multipoint control unit or MCU) and, for exceptional
        applications with a small number of participants, fully-meshed
        conferences, where each participant sends and receives data to
        all other participants. This is described in more detail in
        Sections 5.11 and 5.12.

   Conference calling add-on allows a user to add and drop participants
        once the conference is active. Participants in the SIP session
        accomplish this by sending  INVITE and  BYE requests to the
        parties to be added and dropped. If A wants B to drop out of a
        conference, it sends a  BYE request with " Replaces: *".

   Conference calling meet-me (MMC) allows the user to set up a
        conference or multi-party call, indicating the date, time,
        conference duration, conference media and other parameters. The
        conference session description included in the SIP invitation
        may indicate a time in the future. For multicast conferences,
        participants do not have to connect using SIP at the actual time
        of the conference; instead, they simply subscribe to the
        multicast addresses listed in the announcement. For MCU-based
        conferences, the session description may contain the address of
        the MCU to be called at the time of the conference.

   Some conferences use a multipoint control unit (MCU) to mix, convert
   and replicate media streams. While this solution has scaling
   problems, it is widely deployed in traditional telephony and ISDN
   conferencing settings, as so-called conference bridges. In a MCU-
   based conference, the conference initiator or any authorized member
   invites a new participant and indicates the address of the MCU in the
   Also header. The invitee then contacts the MCU using the same session
   description and requests to be added to the call, just like a normal
   two-party call.

   Parties inviting others to a conference do not have to know that the
   conference media is managed by an MCU. The inviting party A treats
   the MCU M like another participant and includes it in the  Also list.
   The newly invited participant B invites the MCU, which in turn sends
   a  Replaces header with all participants. (See example in Section
   3.5). Figure 2 shows the transition from a fully-meshed conference
   (see below) to an MCU-based conference.

   Operator-assisted dial-out: The operator calls each participant, and
        simply indicates the MCU in the  Also list. The  Call-ID and/or
        the address used by the operator serves as the identifier to the
        MCU. For example:


   O -> A:    INVITE A SIP/2.0
              From: O
              Also: conference176@M

   A -> M:    INVITE conference176@M
              Requested-By: O


   Meet-me: The leader and participants dial into their conference at
        the scheduled time with an assigned conference identifier and
        security code.


   A -> M:    INVITE conference189@M
              From: A


5.12 Fully-Meshed Conferences

   For very small conferences, such as adding a third party to a two-
   party call, multicast may not always be appropriate or available.
   Instead, when inviting a new participant, the caller asks the new
   member to call the remaining members. The  Call-ID for all
   participants is the same.
