1.  Introduction

   IMAP stores are often used by many clients.  Each client may cache
   data from the server so that they don't need to re-download
   information.  [RFC3501] defines that a mailbox can be uniquely
   referenced by its name and UIDVALIDITY, and a message within that
   mailbox can be uniquely referenced by its mailbox (name +
   UIDVALIDITY) and UID.  The triple of mailbox name, UIDVALIDITY and
   UID is guaranteed to be immutable.

Internet-Draft                IMAP ObjectID                     May 2018


   [RFC4315] defines a COPYUID response which allows a client which
   copies messages to know the mapping between the UIDs in the source
   and destination mailboxes, and hence update its local cache.

   If a mailbox is successfully renamed, the client knows that the same
   messages exist in the destination mailbox name as previously existed
   in the source mailbox name.

   The result is that the client which copies (or [RFC6851] moves)
   messages or renames a mailbox can update its local cache, but any
   other client connected to the same store can not know with certainty
   that the messages are identical, and so will re-download everything.

   This extension adds new properties to a message (EMAILID) and mailbox
   (MAILBOXID) which allow a client to quickly identify messages or
   mailboxes which have been renamed by another client.

   This extension also adds an optional thread identifier (THREADID) to
   messages, which can be used by the server to indicate messages which
   it has identified to be related.

2.  Conventions Used In This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when they
   appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear in this document in
   lower case as plain English words, absent their normative meanings.

3.  CAPABILITY Identification

   IMAP servers that support this extension MUST include "OBJECTID" in
   the response list to the CAPABILITY command.

4.  MAILBOXID object identifier

   The MAILBOXID is a server-allocated unique identifer for each
   mailbox.

   The server SHOULD return the same MAILBOXID for a server with the
   same mailbox name and UIDVALIDITY.  This is almost MUST, but weakened
   to allow for the possibility of loss of OBJECTID data during disaster
   recovery while still keeping the name and UIDVALIDITY the same.

Internet-Draft                IMAP ObjectID                     May 2018


   The server MUST NOT report the same MAILBOXID for two mailboxes at
   the same time.

   The server MUST NOT reuse the same MAILBOXID for a mailbox which does
   not obey all the invarients that [RFC3501] defines for a mailbox
   which does not change name or UIDVALIDITY.

   The server MAY choose to create a MAILBOXID value in a way that does
   not survive RENAME (e.g. a digest of name + uidvalidity could be
   used), however the client then loses the major benefit of having an
   identifier.

4.1.  New response code for CREATE

   This document extends the CREATE command to have the response code
   MAILBOXID on successful mailbox creation.

   A server advertising the OBJECTID capability MUST include the
   MAILBOXID response code in the tagged OK response to all successful
   CREATE commands.

   Syntax: "MAILBOXID" SP "(" <objectid> ")"

         Response code in tagged OK for successful CREATE command.

   Example:

     C: 3 create foo
     S: 3 OK [MAILBOXID (F2212ea87-6097-4256-9d51-71338625)] Completed
     C: 4 create bar
     S: 4 OK [MAILBOXID (F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3)] Completed
     C: 5 create foo
     S: 5 NO Mailbox already exists

4.2.  New OK Untagged Response for SELECT and EXAMINE

   This document adds a new untagged response code to the SELECT and
   EXAMINE commands.

   A server advertising the OBJECTID capability MUST return an untagged
   OK response with the MAILBOXID response code on all successful SELECT
   and EXAMINE commands.

   Syntax: "OK" SP "[" "MAILBOXID" SP "(" <objectid> ")" "]" text

                Untagged OK response to SELECT or EXAMINE.

   Example:

        C: 27 select "foo"
        [...]
        S: * OK [MAILBOXID (F2212ea87-6097-4256-9d51-71338625)] Ok
        [...]
        S: 27 OK [READ-WRITE] Completed

4.3.  New attribute for STATUS

   This document adds the MAILBOXID attribute to the STATUS command
   using the extended syntax defined in [RFC4466].

   A server that advertises the OBJECTID capability MUST support the
   MAILBOXID status attribute.

   Syntax: "MAILBOXID"

                   The attribute in the STATUS command.

   Syntax: "MAILBOXID" SP "(" <objectid> ")"

      The response item in the STATUS response contains the objectid
      assigned by the server for this mailbox.

   Example:

    C: 6 status foo (mailboxid)
    S: * STATUS foo (MAILBOXID (F2212ea87-6097-4256-9d51-71338625))
    S: 6 OK Completed
    C: 7 status bar (mailboxid)
    S: * STATUS bar (MAILBOXID (F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3))
    S: 7 OK Completed
    C: 8 rename foo renamed
    S: * OK rename foo renamed
    S: 8 OK Completed
    C: 9 status renamed (mailboxid)
    S: * STATUS renamed (MAILBOXID (F2212ea87-6097-4256-9d51-71338625))
    S: 9 OK Completed
    C: 10 status bar (mailboxid)
    S: * STATUS bar (MAILBOXID (F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3))
    S: 10 OK Completed

   When the LIST-STATUS IMAP capability defined in [RFC5819] is also
   available, the STATUS command can be combined with the LIST command.

   C: 11 list "" "*" return (status (mailboxid))
   S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." INBOX
   S: * STATUS INBOX (MAILBOXID (Ff8e3ead4-9389-4aff-adb1-d8d89efd8cbf))
   S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." bar
   S: * STATUS bar (MAILBOXID (F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3))
   S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." renamed
   S: * STATUS renamed (MAILBOXID (F2212ea87-6097-4256-9d51-71338625))
   S: 11 OK Completed (0.001 secs 3 calls)

5.  EMAILID object identifier and THREADID correlator

   This document defines the data items EMAILID and THREADID on
   messages.

5.1.  EMAILID identifier for identical messages

   The EMAILID data item is an objectid which uniquely identifies the
   content of a single message.  Anything which must remain immutable on
   a {name, uidvalidity, uid} triple must also be the same between
   messages with the same EMAILID.

   The server SHOULD return the same EMAILID for the same UID triple.
   As with MAILBOXID above, this is almost a MUST, but allows for the
   possibility of loss of OBJECTID data in disaster recovery without
   having to change UIDVALIDITY.

   The server SHOULD return the same EMAILID for the exact same message
   content in different folders after a COPY or [RFC6851] MOVE command.

   The server MAY assign the same EMAILID as an existing message upon
   APPEND if it detects that the new message has exactly identical
   content to that existing message.

5.2.  THREADID identifer for related messages

   The THREADID data item is an objectid which uniquely identifies a set
   of messages which the server believes should be grouped together when
   presented.

   THREADID calculation is generally based on some combination of
   References, In-Reply-To and Subject, but the exact logic is left up
   to the server implementation.  [RFC5256] describes some algorithms
   that MAY be used, however this specfication does not mandate any
   particular strategy.

   The server MUST return the same THREADID for all messages with the
   same EMAILID.

Internet-Draft                IMAP ObjectID                     May 2018


   The server SHOULD return the same THREADID for related messages even
   if they are in different mailboxes.

   THREADID is optional, if the server is unable to calculate
   relationships between messages, it MUST return NIL to in all FETCH
   responses for the THREADID data item, and a SEARCH for THREADID MUST
   NOT match any messages.

   The server MAY use the same objectid value for both EMAILID and
   THREADID, for example the THREADID could be the EMAILID of the first
   message that the server has seen in each thread.

5.3.  New Message Data Items in FETCH and UID FETCH Commands

   This document defines two FETCH items:

   Syntax: EMAILID

     The EMAILID message data item causes the server to return EMAILID
     FETCH response data items.

   Syntax: THREADID

    The THREADID message data item causes the server to return THREADID
    FETCH response data items.

   And the following responses:

   Syntax: EMAILID ( <objectid> )

   The EMAILID response data item contains the server-assigned objectid
   for each message.

   Syntax: THREADID ( <objectid> )

   The THREADID response data item contains the server-assigned objectid
   for the set of related messages to which this message belongs.

   Syntax: THREADID NIL

     The NIL value to the THREADID response data item is returned when
     the server mailbox does not support THREADID calculation.

6.  New Filters on SEARCH command

   This document defines filters EMAILID and THREADID on the SEARCH
   command.

   EMAILID <objectid>

         Messages whose EMAILID is exactly the specified objectid.

   THREADID <objectid>

        Messages whose THREADID is exactly the specified objectid.

   Example: (as if run before the MOVE above when the mailbox had 3
   messages)

                 C: 27 search emailid M6d99ac3275bb4e
                 S: * SEARCH 1

                 S: 28 OK Completed (2 msgs in 0.000 secs)

7.  Formal syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.  Elements not defined here can be
   found in the formal syntax of the ABNF [RFC5234], IMAP [RFC3501], and
   IMAP ABNF extensions [RFC4466] specifications.

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper- or lowercase characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability =/ "OBJECTID"

   fetch-att =/ "EMAILID" / "THREADID"

   fetch-emailid-resp = "EMAILID" SP "(" objectid ")" ; follows tagged-
   ext production from [RFC4466]

   status-att =/ "MAILBOXID"

   status-att-value =/ "MAILBOXID" SP "(" objectid ")" ; follows tagged-
   ext production from [RFC4466]

8.  Implementation considerations

8.1.  Assigning object identifiers

   All objectid values are allocated by the server.

   In the interests of reducing the possibilities of encoding mistakes,
   objectids are restricted to a safe subset of possible byte values,
   and in order to allow clients to allocate storage, they are
   restricted in length.

   An objectid is a string of 1 to 255 characters from the following set
   of 64 codepoints. a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_', '-'.  These characters are safe
   to use in almost any context (e.g. filesystems, URIs, IMAP atoms).

   For maximum safety, servers SHOULD also follow defensive allocation
   strategies to avoid creating risks where glob completion or data type
   detection may be present (e.g. on filesystems or in spreadsheets).
   In particular it is wise to avoid:

   o  ids starting with -

   o  ids starting with digits

   o  ids which contain only digits

   o  ids which differ only by ASCII case (A vs a)

   o  the specific sequence of 3 characters NIL

Internet-Draft                IMAP ObjectID                     May 2018


   A good solution to these issues is to prefix every ID with a single
   alphabetical character.

8.2.  Interaction with special cases

   The case of RENAME INBOX may need special handling for unique ids.

   It is advisable (though not required) to have MAILBOXID be globally
   unique, but it is only required to be unique within messages offered
   to a single client login to a single server hostname.  For example, a
   proxy which aggregates multiple independent servers MUST NOT
   advertise the OBJECTID capability unless it can guarantee that the
   backends will not use the same identifiers for different objects.

8.3.  Client usage

   Servers that implement both RFC 6154 and this specification SHOULD
   optimize their execution of command like UID SEARCH OR EMAILID 1234
   EMAILID 4321.

   Clients can assume that searching the all-mail mailbox using OR/
   EMAILID or OR/THREADID is a fast way to find messages again if some
   other client has moved them out of the mailbox where they were
   previously seen.

   Clients that cache data offline SHOULD fetch the EMAILID of all new
   messages to avoid re-downloading already cached message details.

   Clients SHOULD fetch the MAILBOXID for any new mailboxes before
   discarding cache data for any mailbox which is no longer present on
   the server, so that they can detect renames and avoid re-downloading
   data.

9.  Future considerations

   This extension is intentionally defined to be compatible with the
   data model in [I-D.ietf-jmap-mail].

   A future extension could be proposed to give a way to SELECT a
   mailbox by MAILBOXID rather than name.

   An extension to allow fetching message content directly via EMAILID
   and message listings by THREADID could be proposed.

Internet-Draft                IMAP ObjectID                     May 2018


10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add "OBJECTID" to the "IMAP Capabilities"
   registry located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-
   capabilities>.

   IANA is requested to add "MAILBOXID" to the "IMAP Response Codes"
   registry located at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-response-
   codes> with a Reference of [[THIS RFC]].

11.  Security Considerations

   It is strongly advised that servers generate OBJECTIDs which are safe
   to use as filesystem names, and unlikely to be auto-detected as
   numbers.  See implementation considerations.

   If a digest is used for ID generation, it must have a collision
   resistent property, so server implementations are advised to monitor
   current security research and choose secure digests.

   The use of a digest for ID generation may be used as proof that a
   particular sequence of bytes was seen by the server.

   extensions>.

   Dovecot X-GUID implementation.

13.1.  Appendix 1: ideas for implementing object identifiers

   Ideas for implementing MAILBOXID:

   o  Digest of (MailboxName/UIDVALIDITY) - not kept when renaming, but
      is guaranteed unique and doesn't require storage.

   o  [RFC4122] UUID

   o  Server assigned sequence number (guaranteed not to be reused)

   Ideas for implementing EMAILID:

   o  Digest of (MailboxName/UIDVALIDITY/UID) - is not kept when copying
      messages, but is guaranteed unique and doesn't require storage.

   o  Concatenation of MAILBOXID-UID - for servers which store MAILBOXID
      but not EMAILID.

   o  Digest of message content (RFC822 bytes) - expensive unless cached

   o  [RFC4122] UUID

   o  Server assigned sequence number (guaranteed not to be reused)

   Ideas for implementing THREADID:

   o  Derive from EMAILID of first seen message in the thread.

   o  [RFC4122] UUID

   o  Server assigned sequence number (guaranteed not to be reused)

   There is a need to index and look up reference/in-reply-to data at
   message creation to efficiently find matching messages for threading.
   Threading may be either across folders, or within each folder only.
   The server has significant leeway here.
