                     EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment
              draft-ietf-bess-evpn-virtual-eth-segment-07

Abstract

   EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint
   Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced features
   among which their multi-homing capabilities.  These solutions
   introduce Single-Active and All-Active for an Ethernet Segment (ES),
   itself defined as a set of physical links between the multi-homed
   device/network and a set of PE devices that they are connected to.
   This document extends the Ethernet Segment concept so that an ES can
   be associated to a set of EVCs (e.g., VLANs) or other objects such as
   MPLS Label Switch Paths (LSPs) or Pseudowires (PWs), referred to as
   Virtual Ethernet Segments (vES).  This draft describes the
   requirements and the extensions needed to support vES in EVPN and
   PBB-EVPN.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] introduce a family of solutions for
   multipoint Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced
   features among which their multi-homing capabilities.  These
   solutions introduce Single-Active and All-Active for an Ethernet
   Segment (ES), itself defined as a set of links between the
   multi-homed device/network and a set of PE devices that they are
   connected to.

   This document extends the Ethernet Segment concept so that an ES can
   be associated to a set of EVCs (e.g., VLANs) or other objects such as
   MPLS Label Switch Paths (LSPs) or Pseudowires (PWs), referred to as
   Virtual Ethernet Segments (vES).  This draft describes the
   requirements and the extensions needed to support vES in EVPN and
   PBB-EVPN.

1.1.  Virtual Ethernet Segments in Access Ethernet Networks

   Some Service Providers (SPs) want to extend the concept of the
   physical links in an ES to Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs) where
   many of such EVCs (e.g., VLANs) can be aggregated on a single
   physical External Network-to-Network Interface (ENNI).  An ES that
   consists of a set of EVCs instead of physical links is referred to as
   a virtual ES (vES).  Figure 1 depicts two PE devices (PE1 and PE2)
   each with an ENNI where a number of vESes are aggregated on - each of
   which through its associated EVC.

   ENNIs are commonly used to reach off-network / out-of-franchise
   customer sites via independent Ethernet access networks or third-
   party Ethernet Access Providers (EAP) (see Figure 1).  ENNIs can
   aggregate traffic from hundreds to thousands of vESes, where each vES
   is represented by its associated EVC on that ENNI.  As a result,
   ENNIs and their associated EVCs are a key element of SP off-networks
   that are carefully designed and closely monitored.

   In order to meet customers' Service Level Agreements (SLA), SPs build
   redundancy via multiple EVPN PEs and across multiple ENNIs (as shown
   in Figure 1) where a given vES can be multi-homed to two or more EVPN
   PE devices (on two or more ENNIs) via their associated EVCs.  Just
   like physical ES's in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] solutions, these vESes
   can be single-homed or multi-homed ES's and when multi-homed, then
   can operate in either Single-Active or All-Active redundancy modes.
   In a typical SP off-network scenario, an ENNI can be associated with
   several thousands of single-homed vESes, several hundreds of Single-
   Active vESes and it may also be associated with tens or hundreds of
   All-Active vESes.

1.2.  Virtual Ethernet Segments in Access MPLS Networks

   Other Service Providers (SPs) want to extend the concept of the
   physical links in an ES to individual Pseudowires (PWs) or to MPLS
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Access MPLS networks - i.e., a vES
   consisting of a set of PWs or a set of LSPs.  Figure 2 illustrates
   this concept.

   In some cases, Service Providers use MPLS Aggregation Networks that
   belong to separate administrative entities or third parties as a way
   to get access to their own IP/MPLS Core network infrastructure.  This
   is the case illustrated in Figure 2.

   In such scenarios, a virtual ES (vES) is defined as a set of
   individual PWs if they cannot be aggregated into a common LSP.  If
   the aggregation of PWs is possible, the vES can be associated to an
   LSP in a given PE.  In the example of Figure 2, EVC3 is connected to
   a VPWS instance in AG2 that is connected to PE1 and PE2 via PW3 and
   PW5 respectively.  EVC4 is connected to a separate VPWS instance on

   AG2 that gets connected to an EVI on PE1 and PE2 via PW4 and PW6,
   respectively.  Since the PWs for the two VPWS instances can be
   aggregated into the same LSPs going to the MPLS network, a common
   virtual ES can be defined for LSP1 and LSP2.  This vES will be shared
   by two separate EVIs in the EVPN network.

   In some cases, this aggregation of PWs into common LSPs may not be
   possible.  For instance, if PW3 were terminated into a third PE, e.g.
   PE3, instead of PE1, the vES would need to be defined on a per
   individual PW on each PE, i.e. PW3 and PW5 would belong to ES-1,
   whereas PW4 and PW6 would be associated to ES-2.

   For MPLS/IP access networks where a vES represents a set of PWs or
   LSPs, this document extends Single-Active multi-homing procedures of
   [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] to vES.  The vES extension to All-Active
   multi-homing is outside of the scope of this document for MPLS/IP
   access networks.

   This draft describes requirements and the extensions needed to
   support a vES in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623].  Section 3 lists the set of
   requirements for a vES.  Section 4 describes extensions for a vES
   that are applicable to EVPN solutions including [RFC7432] and
   [RFC7209].  Furthermore, these extensions meet the requirements
   described in Section 3.  Section 4 gives solution overview and
   Section 5 describes failure handling, recovery, scalability, and fast
   convergence of [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] for vESes.

3.1.  Single-Homed and Multi-Homed vES

   A PE needs to support the following types of vESes:

   (R1a) A PE MUST handle single-homed vESes on a single physical port
   (e.g., single ENNI)

   (R1b) A PE MUST handle a mix of Single-Homed vESes and Single-Active
   multi-homed vESes simultaneously on a single physical port (e.g.,
   single ENNI).  Single-Active multi-homed vESes will be simply
   referred to as Single-Active vESes through the rest of this document.

   (R1c) A PE MAY handle All-Active multi-homed vESes on a single
   physical port.  All-Active multi-homed vESes will be simply referred
   to as All-Active vESes through the rest of this document.

   (R1d) A PE MAY handle a mix of All-Active vESes along with other
   types of vESes on a single physical port.

   (R1e) A Multi-Homed vES (Single-Active or All-Active) can be spread
   across two or more ENNIs, on any two or more PEs.

3.2.  Scalability

   A single physical port (e.g., ENNI) can be associated with many
   vESes.  The following requirements give a quantitative measure for
   each vES type.

   (R2a) A PE SHOULD handle very large number of Single-Homed vESes on a
   single physical port (e.g., thousands of vESes on a single ENNI).

   (R2b) A PE SHOULD handle large number of Single-Active vESes on a
   single physical port (e.g., hundreds of vESes on a single ENNI).

   (R2c) A PE MAY handle large number of All-Active vESes on a single
   physical port (e.g., hundreds of vESes on a single ENNI).

   (R2d) A PE SHOULD handle the above scale for a mix of Single-homed
   vESes and Single-Active vESes simultaneously on a single physical
   port (e.g., single ENNI).

   (R2e) A PE MAY handle the above sale for a mix of All-Active vESes
   along with other types of vESes on a single physical port.

3.3.  Local Switching

   Many vESes of different types can be aggregated on a single physical
   port on a PE device and some of these vES can belong to the same
   service instance (or customer).  This translates into the need for
   supporting local switching among the vESes of the same service
   instance on the same physical port (e.g., ENNI) of the PE.

   (R3a) A PE MUST support local switching among different vESes
   belonging to the same service instance (or customer) on a single
   physical port.  For example, in Figure 1, PE1 MUST support local
   switching between CE11 and CE12 (both belonging to customer A) that
   are mapped to two Single-homed vESes on ENNI1.  In case of Single-
   Active vESes, the local switching is performed among active EVCs
   belonging to the same service instance on the same ENNI.

3.4.  EVC Service Types

   A physical port (e.g., ENNI) of a PE can aggregate many EVCs each of
   which is associated with a vES.  Furthermore, an EVC may carry one or
   more VLANs.  Typically, an EVC carries a single VLAN and thus it is
   associated with a single broadcast domain.  However, there is no
   restriction on an EVC to carry more than one VLAN.

   (R4a) An EVC can be associated with a single broadcast domain - e.g.,
   VLAN-based service or VLAN bundle service.

   (R4b) An EVC MAY be associated with several broadcast domains - e.g.,
   VLAN-aware bundle service.

   In the same way, a PE can aggregate many LSPs and PWs.  In the case
   of individual PWs per vES, typically a PW is associated with a single
   broadcast domain, but there is no restriction on the PW to carry more
   than one VLAN if the PW is of type Raw mode.

   (R4c) A PW can be associated with a single broadcast domain - e.g.,
   VLAN-based service or VLAN bundle service.

   (R4d) An PW MAY be associated with several broadcast domains - e.g.,
   VLAN-aware bundle service.

3.5.  Designated Forwarder (DF) Election

   Section 8.5 of [RFC7432] describes the default procedure for DF
   election in EVPN which is also used in [RFC7623] and [RFC8214].
   [RFC8584] describes the additional procedures for DF election in
   EVPN.  These DF election procedures is performed at the granularity
   of (ESI, Ethernet Tag).  In case of a vES, the same EVPN default



Sajassi, et al.          Expires January 7, 2022                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


   procedure for DF election also applies; however, at the granularity
   of (vESI, Ethernet Tag); where vESI is the virtual Ethernet Segment
   Identifier and the Ethernet Tag field is represented by and I-SID in
   PBB-EVPN and by a VLAN ID (VID) in EVPN.  As in [RFC7432], this
   default procedure for DF election at the granularity of (vESI,
   Ethernet Tag) is also referred to as "service carving".  With service
   carving, it is desirable to evenly partition the DFs for different
   vES's among different PEs, thus evenly distributing the traffic among
   different PEs.  The following list the requirements apply to DF
   election of vES's for (PBB-)EVPN.

   (R5a) A vES with m EVCs can be distributed among n ENNIs belonging to
   p PEs in any arbitrary order; where n >= p >= m.  For example, if
   there is an vES with 2 EVCs and there are 5 ENNIs on 5 PEs (PE1
   through PE5), then vES can be dual-homed to PE2 and PE4 and the DF
   election must be performed between PE2 and PE4.

   (R5b) Each vES MUST be identified by its own virtual ESI (vESI).

3.6.  OAM

   In order to detect the failure of an individual EVC and perform DF
   election for its associated vES as the result of this failure, each
   EVC should be monitored independently.

   (R6a) Each EVC SHOULD be monitored for its health independently.

   (R6b) A single EVC failure (among many aggregated on a single
   physical port/ENNI) MUST trigger DF election for its associated vES.

3.7.  Failure and Recovery

   (R7a) Failure and failure recovery of an EVC for a Single-homed vES
   SHALL NOT impact any other EVCs within its service instance or any
   other service instances.  In other words, for PBB-EVPN, it SHALL NOT
   trigger any MAC flushing both within its own I-SID as well as other
   I-SIDs.

   (R7b) In case of All-Active vES, failure and failure recovery of an
   EVC for that vES SHALL NOT impact any other EVCs within its service
   instance or any other service instances.  In other words, for PBB-
   EVPN, it SHALL NOT trigger any MAC flushing both within its own I-SID
   as well as other I-SIDs.

   (R7c) Failure and failure recovery of an EVC for a Single-Active vES
   SHALL impact only its own service instance.  In other words, for PBB-
   EVPN, MAC flushing SHALL be limited to the associated I-SID only and
   SHALL NOT impact any other I-SIDs.



Sajassi, et al.          Expires January 7, 2022               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


   (R7d) Failure and failure recovery of an EVC for a Single-Active vES
   MAY only impact C-MACs associated with MHD/MHNs for that service
   instance.  In other words, MAC flushing SHOULD be limited to single
   service instance (I-SID in the case of PBB-EVPN) and only C-MACs for
   Single-Active MHD/MHNs.

3.8.  Fast Convergence

   Since a large number of EVCs (and their associated vESes) are
   aggregated via a single physical port (e.g., ENNI), then the failure
   of that physical port impacts a large number of vESes and triggers
   equally many ES route withdrawals.  Formulating, sending, receiving,
   and processing such large number of BGP messages can introduce delay
   in DF election and convergence time.  As such, it is highly desirable
   to have a mass-withdraw mechanism similar to the one in [RFC7432] for
   withdrawing many Ethernet A-D per ES routes.

   (R8a) There SHOULD be a mechanism equivalent to EVPN mass-withdraw
   such that upon an ENNI failure, only a single BGP message is needed
   to indicate to the remote PEs to trigger DF election for all impacted
   vES associated with that ENNI.

4.  Solution Overview

   The solutions described in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] are leveraged
   as-is with the modification that the ESI assignment is performed for
   an EVC or a group of EVCs or LSPs/PWs instead of a link or a group of
   physical links.  In other words, the ESI is associated with a virtual
   ES (vES), hereby referred to as vESI.

   For the EVPN solution, everything basically remains the same except
   for the handling of physical port failure where many vESes can be
   impacted.  Sections 5.1 and 5.3 below describe the handling of
   physical port/link failure for EVPN.  In a typical multi-homed
   operation, MAC addresses are learned behind a vES and are advertised
   with the ESI corresponding to the vES (i.e., vESI).  EVPN aliasing
   and mass-withdraw operations are performed with respect to vES
   identifier: the Ethernet A-D routes for these operations are
   advertised with vESI instead of ESI.

   For PBB-EVPN solution, the main change is with respect to the B-MAC
   address assignment which is performed similar to what is described in
   section 7.2.1.1 of [RFC7623] with the following refinements:

   o  One shared B-MAC address SHOULD be used per PE for the
      single-homed vESes.  In other words, a single B-MAC is shared for
      all single-homed vESes on that PE.

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


   o  One shared B-MAC address SHOULD be used per PE per physical port
      (e.g., ENNI) for the Single-Active vESes.  In other words, a
      single B-MAC is shared for all Single-Active vESes that share the
      same ENNI.

   o  One shared B-MAC address MAY be used for all Single-Active vESes
      on that PE.

   o  One B-MAC address SHOULD be used per set of EVCs representing an
      All-Active vES.  In other words, a single B-MAC address is used
      per vES for All-Active scenarios.

   o  A single B-MAC address MAY also be used per vES per PE for Single-
      Active scenarios.

4.1.  EVPN DF Election for vES

   The procedure for service carving for virtual Ethernet Segments is
   the same as the ones outlined in section 8.5 of [RFC7432] and
   [RFC8584] except for the fact that ES is replaced with vES.

   For the sake of clarity and completeness, the default DF election
   procedure of [RFC7432] is repeated below:

   1.  When a PE discovers the vESI or is configured with the vESI
       associated with its attached vES, it advertises an Ethernet



Sajassi, et al.          Expires January 7, 2022               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


       Segment route with the associated ES-Import extended community
       attribute.

   2.  The PE then starts a timer (default value = 3 seconds) to allow
       the reception of Ethernet Segment routes from other PE nodes
       connected to the same vES.  This timer value MUST be same across
       all PEs connected to the same vES.

   3.  When the timer expires, each PE builds an ordered list of the IP
       addresses of all the PE nodes connected to the vES (including
       itself), in increasing numeric value.  Each IP address in this
       list is extracted from the "Originator Router's IP address" field
       of the advertised Ethernet Segment route.  Every PE is then given
       an ordinal indicating its position in the ordered list, starting
       with 0 as the ordinal for the PE with the numerically lowest IP
       address.  The ordinals are used to determine which PE node will
       be the DF for a given EVPN instance on the vES using the
       following rule: Assuming a redundancy group of N PE nodes, the PE
       with ordinal i is the DF for an EVPN instance with an associated
       Ethernet Tag value of V when (V mod N) = i.  It should be noted
       that using "Originator Router's IP address" field in the Ethernet
       Segment route to get the PE IP address needed for the ordered
       list, allows for a CE to be multi-homed across different ASes if
       such need ever arises.

   4.  The PE that is elected as a DF for a given EVPN instance will
       unblock traffic for that EVPN instance.  Note that the DF PE
       unblocks all traffic in both ingress and egress directions for
       Single-Active vES and unblocks multi-destination in egress
       direction for All-Active Multi-homed vES.  All non-DF PEs block
       all traffic in both ingress and egress directions for Single-
       Active vES and block multi-destination traffic in the egress
       direction for All-Active vES.

   In the case of an EVC failure, the affected PE withdraws its Virtual
   Ethernet Segment route if there are no more EVCs associated to the
   vES in the PE.  This will re-trigger the DF Election procedure on all
   the PEs in the Redundancy Group.  For PE node failure, or upon PE
   commissioning or decommissioning, the PEs re-trigger the DF Election
   procedure across all affected vESes.  In case of a Single-Active,
   when a service moves from one PE in the Redundancy Group to another
   PE as a result of DF re-election, the PE, which ends up being the
   elected DF for the service, SHOULD trigger a MAC address flush
   notification towards the associated vES.  This can be done, for e.g.
   using IEEE 802.1ak MVRP 'new' declaration.

   For LSP-based and PW-based vES, the non-DF PE SHOULD signal PW-status
   'standby' to the Aggregation PE (e.g., AG PE in Figure 2), and a new



Sajassi, et al.          Expires January 7, 2022               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


   DF PE MAY send an LDP MAC withdraw message as a MAC address flush
   notification.  It should be noted that the PW-status is signaled for
   the scenarios where there is a one-to-one mapping between EVI/BD and
   the PW.

4.2.  Grouping and Route Colouring for vES

   Physical ports (e.g.  ENNI) which aggregate a large number of EVCs
   are 'coloured' to enable the grouping schemes described below.

   By default, the MAC address of the corresponding port (e.g.  ENNI) is
   used to represent the 'colour' of the port, and the EVPN Router's MAC
   Extended Community defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding] is used to signal this
   colour.

   The difference between colouring mechanism for EVPN and PBB-EVPN is
   that for EVPN, the extended community is advertised with the Ethernet
   A-D per ES route whereas for PBB-EVPN, the extended community may be
   advertised with the B-MAC route.

   The following sections describe Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES and
   Grouping B-MAC, will become crucial for port failure handling as seen
   in Section 5.3, Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 below.

4.2.1.  EVPN Route Colouring for vES

   When a PE discovers the vESI or is configured with the vESI
   associated with its attached vES, an Ethernet-Segment route and
   Ethernet A-D per ES route are generated using the vESI identifier.

   These Ethernet-Segment and Ethernet A-D per ES routes specific to
   each vES are coloured with an attribute representing their
   association to a physical port (e.g.  ENNI).

   The corresponding port 'colour' is encoded in the EVPN Router's MAC
   Extended Community defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding] and advertised along
   with the Ethernet Segment and Ethernet A-D per ES routes for this
   vES.

   The PE also constructs a special Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES route
   which represents all the vES associated with the port (e.g.  ENNI).
   The corresponding port 'colour' is encoded in the ESI field.  For
   this encoding, Type 3 ESI ([RFC7432] Section 5) is used with the MAC
   field set to the colour (MAC address) of the port and the 3-octet
   local discriminator field set to 0xFFFFFF.

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


   The ESI label extended community ([RFC7432] Section 7.5) is not
   relevant to Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES.  The label value is NOT
   used for encalsulating BUM packets for any split-horizon function and
   the 'Single-Active' but is left as 0.  To save label space, all
   Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES of a PE SHOULD use same label value.

   This Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES is advertised with a list of Route
   Targets corresponding to the impacted service instances.  If the
   number of Route Targets is more than can fit into a single attribute,
   then a set of Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES routes are advertised.

4.2.2.  PBB-EVPN Route Colouring for vES

   For PBB-EVPN, especially where there here are large number of service
   instances (i.e., I-SIDs) associated with each EVC the PE MAY colour
   each vES B-MAC route with an attribute representing their association
   to a physical port (e.g.  ENNI).

   The corresponding port 'colour' is encoded in the EVPN Router's MAC
   Extended Community defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding] and advertised along
   with the B-MAC for this vES in PBB-EVPN.

   The PE MAY then also construct a special Grouping B-MAC route which
   represents all the vES associated with the port (e.g.  ENNI).  The
   corresponding port 'colour' is encoded directly into this special
   Grouping B-MAC route.

5.  Failure Handling and Recovery

   There are a number of failure scenarios to consider such as:

   A: CE uplink port failure

   B: Ethernet Access Network failure

   C: PE access-facing port or link failure

   D: PE node failure

   E: PE isolation from IP/MPLS network

   [RFC7432], [RFC7623], and [RFC8214] solutions provide protection
   against such failures as described in the corresponding references.
   In the presence of virtual Ethernet Segments (vESes) in these
   solutions, besides the above failure scenarios, individual EVC
   failure is an additional scenario to consider.  Handling vES failure
   scenarios implies that individual EVCs or PWs need to be monitored

   and upon detection of failure or restoration of services, appropriate
   DF election and failure recovery mechanisms are executed.

   [RFC7023] is used for monitoring EVCs and upon failure detection of a
   given EVC, DF election procedure per Section 4.1 is executed.  For
   PBB-EVPN, some extensions are needed to handle the failure and
   recovery procedures of [RFC7623] in order to meet the above
   requirements.  These extensions are described in the next section.

   [RFC4377] and [RFC6310] are used for monitoring the status of LSPs
   and/or PWs associated to vES.

5.1.  EVC Failure Handling for Single-Active vES in EVPN

   In [RFC7432], when a DF PE connected to a Single-Active multi-homed
   Ethernet Segment loses connectivity to the segment, due to link or
   port failure, it signals to the remote PEs to invalidate all MAC
   addresses associated with that Ethernet Segment.  This is done by
   means of a mass-withdraw message, by withdrawing the Ethernet A-D per
   ES route.  It should be noted that for dual-homing use cases where
   there is only a single backup path, MAC invalidating can be avoided
   by the remote PEs as they can update their nexthop associated with
   the affected MAC entries to the backup path per procedure described
   in section 8.2 of [RFC7432].

Internet-Draft        EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment            July 2021


   In case of an EVC failure which impacts a single vES, this same EVPN
   procedure is used.  In this case, the mass-withdraw is conveyed by
   withdrawing the Ethernet A-D per vES route carrying the vESI
   representing the failed EVC.  The remote PEs upon receiving this
   message perform the same procedures outlined in section 8.2 of
   [RFC7432].

5.2.  EVC Failure Handling for Single-Active vES in PBB-EVPN

   In [RFC7432], when a PE connected to a Single-Active Ethernet Segment
   loses connectivity to the segment, due to link or port failure, it
   signals the remote PE to flush all C-MAC addresses associated with
   that Ethernet Segment.  This is done by updating the advertised a
   B-MAC route's MAC Mobility Extended community.

   In case of an EVC failure that impacts a single vES, if the above
   PBB-EVPN procedure is used, it results in excessive C-MAC flushing
   because a single physical port can support large number of EVCs (and
   their associated vESes) and thus updating the advertised B-MAC
   corresponding to the physical port, with MAC mobility Extended
   community, will result in flushing C-MAC addresses not just for the
   impacted EVC but for all other EVCs on that port.

   In order to reduce the scope of C-MAC flushing to only the impacted
   service instances (the service instance(s) impacted by the EVC
   failure), the PBB-EVPN C-MAC flushing needs to be adapted on a per
   service instance basis (i.e., per I-SID).
   [I-D.ietf-bess-pbb-evpn-isid-cmacflush] introduces B-MAC/I-SID route
   where existing PBB-EVPN B-MAC route is modified to carry an I-SID in
   the "Ethernet Tag ID" field instead of NULL value.  This field
   indicates to the receiving PE, to flush all C-MAC addresses
   associated with that I-SID for that B-MAC.  This C-MAC flushing
   mechanism per I-SID SHOULD be used in case of EVC failure impacting a
   vES.  Since typically an EVC maps to a single broadcast domain and
   thus a single service instance, the affected PE only needs to
   advertise a single B-MAC/I-SID route.  However, if the failed EVC
   carries multiple VLANs each with its own broadcast domain, then the
   affected PE needs to advertise multiple B-MAC/I-SID routes - one for
   each VLAN (broadcast domain) - i.e., one for each I-SID.  Each B-MAC/
   I-SID route basically instructs the remote PEs to perform flushing
   for C-MACs corresponding to the advertised B-MAC only for the
   advertised I-SID.

   The C-MAC flushing based on B-MAC/I-SID route works fine when there
   are only a few VLANs (e.g., I-SIDs) per EVC.  However if the number
   of I-SIDs associated with a failed EVC is large, then it is
   recommended to assign a B-MAC per vES and upon EVC failure, the
   affected PE simply withdraws this B-MAC message to other PEs.

5.3.  Port Failure Handling for Single-Active vESes in EVPN

   When a large number of EVCs are aggregated via a single physical port
   on a PE, where each EVC corresponds to a vES, then the port failure
   impacts all the associated EVCs and their corresponding vESes.  If
   the number of EVCs corresponding to the Single-Active vESes for that
   physical port is in thousands, then thousands of service instances
   are impacted.  Therefore, the propagation if failure in BGP needs to
   address all these impacted service instances.  In order to achieve
   this, the following extensions are added to the baseline EVPN
   mechanism:

   1.  When a PE advertises an Ethernet A-D per ES route for a given
       vES, it is coloured as described in Section 4.2.1 using the
       physical port MAC by default.  The receiving PEs take note of
       this colour and create a list of vESes for this colour.

   2.  The PE also advertises a special Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES
       route for that colour, which represents all the vES associated
       with the port.

   3.  Upon a port failure (e.g., ENNI failure), the PE sends a
       mass-withdraw message by withdrawing the Grouping Ethernet A-D
       per ES route.

   4.  The remote PEs upon receiving this message, by identifying the
       Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES route, detect the special vES
       mass-withdraw message.  The remote PEs then access the list
       created in (1) of the vES's for the specified colour, and
       initiate locally MAC address invalidating procedures for each of
       the vES's in the list.

   In scenarios where a logical ENNI is used the above procedure equally
   applies.  The logical ENNI is represented by a Grouping Ethernet A-D
   per ES where the Type 3 ESI and the 6 bytes used in the ENNI's ESI
   MAC address field is used as a colour for vESes as described above
   and in Section 4.2.1.

5.4.  Port Failure Handling for Single-Active vESes in PBB-EVPN

   When a large number of EVCs are aggregated via a single physical port
   on a PE, where each EVC corresponds to a vES, then the port failure
   impacts all the associated EVCs and their corresponding vESes.  If
   the number of EVCs corresponding to the Single-Active vESes for that
   physical port is in thousands, then thousands of service instances
   (I-SIDs) are impacted.  In such failure scenarios, the following two
   MAC flushing mechanisms per [RFC7623] can be performed.

   1.  If the MAC address of the physical port is used for PBB
       encapsulation as B-MAC SA, then upon the port failure, the PE
       MUST use the EVPN MAC route withdrawal message to signal the
       flush.

   2.  If the PE shared MAC address is used for PBB encapsulation as
       B-MAC SA, then upon the port failure, the PE MUST re-advertise
       this MAC route with the MAC Mobility Extended Community to signal
       the flush.

   The first method is recommended because it reduces the scope of
   flushing the most.

   As noted above, the advertisement of the extended community along
   with B-MAC route for colouring purposes is optional and only
   recommended when there are many vESes per physical port and each vES
   is associated with very large number of service instances (i.e.,
   large numbe of I-SIDs).

   If there are large number of service instances (i.e., I-SIDs)
   associated with each EVC, and if there is a B-MAC assigned per vES as
   recommended in the above section, then in order to handle port
   failure efficiently, the following extensions are added to the
   baseline PBB-EVPN mechanism:

   1.  Each vES MAY be coloured with a MAC address representing the
       physical port similar to the colouring mechanism for EVPN.  In
       other words, each B-MAC representing a vES is advertised with the
       'colour' of the physical port per Section 4.2.2.  The receiving
       PEs take note of this colour being advertised along with the
       B-MAC route and for each such colour, create a list of vESes
       associated with this colour.

   2.  The PE also advertises a special Grouping B-MAC route for that
       colour (consisting by default of port MAC address), which
       represents all the vES associated with the port.

   3.  Upon a port failure (e.g., ENNI failure), the PE sends a
       mass-withdraw message by withdrawing the Grouping B-MAC route.

   4.  The remote PEs upon receiving this message, by identifying the
       Grouping B-MAC route, detect the special vES mass-withdraw
       message.  The remote PEs then access the list created in (1) of
       the vES's for the specified colour, and flush C-MACs associated
       with the failed physical port.

5.5.  Fast Convergence in (PBB-)EVPN

   As described above, when a large number of EVCs are aggregated via a
   physical port on a PE, and where each EVC corresponds to a vES, then
   the port failure impacts all the associated EVCs and their
   corresponding vESes.  Two actions must be taken as the result of such
   port failure:

   o  For EVPN initiate mass-withdraw procedure for all vESes associated
      with the failed port to invalidate MACs and for PBB-EVPN flush all
      C-MACs associated with the failed port across all vESes and the
      impacted I-SIDs

   o  DF election for all impacted vESes associated with the failed port

   Section 5.3 already describes how to perform mass-withdraw for all
   affected vESes and invalidating MACs using a single BGP withdrawal of
   the Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES route.  Section 5.4 describes how to
   only flush C-MAC address associated with the failed physical port
   (e.g., optimum C-MAC flushing) as well as, optionally, the withdrawal
   of a Grouping B-MAC route.

   This section describes how to perform DF election in the most optimal
   way - e.g., to trigger DF election for all impacted vESes (which can
   be very large) among the participating PEs via a single BGP message
   as opposed to sending large number of BGP messages (one per vES).
   This section assumes that the MAC flushing mechanism described in
   Section 5.4, bullet (1) is used and route colouring is used.

      Figure 5: Fast Convergence Upon ENNI Failure


   The procedure for colouring vES Ethernet Segment routes is described
   in Section 4.2.  The following describes the procedure for fast
   convergence for DF election using these coloured routes:

   1.  When a vES is configured, the PE advertises the Ethernet Segment
       route for this vES with a colour corresponding to the physical
       port.

   2.  All receiving PEs (in the redundancy group) take note of this
       colour and create a list of vESes for this colour.

   3.  Recall, that the PE is advertising also a Grouping Ethernet A-D
       per ES (for EVPN) and a Grouping B-MAC (for PBB-EVPN)
       representing this colour and vES grouping.

   4.  Upon a port failure (e.g., ENNI failure), the PE withdraws this
       previously advertised Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES or Grouping
       B-MAC associated with the failed port.  The PE should prioritize
       sending these Grouping routes withdraw message over individual
       vES route withdrawal messages of impacted vESes.

   5.  On reception of Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES or Grouping B-MAC
       route withdrawal, other PEs in the redundancy group initiate DF
       election procedures across all their affected vESes.

   6.  The PE with the physical port failure (ENNI failure), also sends
       vES route withdrawal for every impacted vES.  The other PEs upon
       receiving these messages, clear up their BGP tables.  It should
       be noted the vES route withdrawal messages are not used for
       executing DF election procedures by the receiving PEs when
       Grouping Ethernet A-D per ES or Grouping B-MAC withdrawal has
       been previously received.

   The authors would like to thank Mei Zhang, Jose Liste, and
   Luc Andre Burdet for their reviews of this document and feedback.

7.  Security Considerations

   All the security considerations in [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] apply
   directly to this document because this document leverages the control
   and data plane procedures described in those documents.

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond that of [RFC7432] and [RFC7623] because advertisements and
   processing of Ethernet Segment route for vES in this document follows
   that of physical ES in those RFCs.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated sub-type value 7 in the "EVPN Extended Community
   Sub-Types" registry defined in "https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-
   extended-communities/bgp-extended-communities.xhtml#evpn" as follows:


      SUB-TYPE   NAME           Reference
      ----   --------------   -------------
      0x07   I-SID Ext Comm   [draft-ietf-bess-evpn-virtual-eth-segment]


   It is requested from IANA to update the reference to this document.

9.  Intellectual Property Considerations

   This document is being submitted for use in IETF standards
   discussions.
