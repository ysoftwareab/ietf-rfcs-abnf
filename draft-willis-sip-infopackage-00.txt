Abstract

   The SIP INFO method (RFC 2976) establishes a method by which
   applications may transfer application-specific information within a
   SIP dialog.  However, RFC 2976 does not provide a mechanism for
   describing and documenting an application of INFO, nor does it
   provide a mechanism by which applications may negotiate such uses.
   This document provides a framework for documenting and naming
   specific uses of INFO (called INFO packages), for registering those
   package names with IANA, and for negotiating the support for various
   INFO packages between applications using SIP.

Internet-Draft     SIP INFO Packaging and Negotiation       January 2002


1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

2. Background

   The SIP INFO Method is defined in RFC 2976 [4].  The purpose of INFO,
   as described therein, is The purpose of the INFO message is "to carry
   application level information along the SIP signaling path." This
   purpose is further clarified as "The INFO method is not used to
   change the state of SIP calls, or the parameters of the sessions SIP
   initiates.  It merely sends optional application layer information,
   generally related to the session."

   However, RFC 2976 [4] is restrained in its discussion of the
   semantics and usage of info.  Particularly, it says "There are no
   specific semantics associated with INFO.  The semantics are derived
   from the body or new headers defined for usage in INFO." RFC 2976 [4]
   further says "Handling of INFO messages that contain message bodies
   is outside the scope of this document.  The documents defining the
   message bodies will also need to define the SIP protocol rules
   associated with those message bodies."

   This lack of specificity has given rise to concerns such as those
   defined in draft-rosenberg-sip-info-harmful [8] that poorly
   documented uses of INFO might become commonplace, and that the lack
   of a negotiation mechanism for uses of INFO might make determining
   when and how two communication applications should use INFO dificult.
   This situation would not provide favorable conditions for the
   reliable interoperability expected of Internet protocols.

   The SIP Events specification RFC 3265 [6] dealt with a similar
   problem of documentation and negotiation problem through the use of a
   registration template called an "event package", an accompanying IANA
   registray, and the use of a SIP extension header field
   "allow-events".

   This document uses a similar approach, specifying a registration
   template called an "info package", an accompanying IANA registry, and
   the SIP extension header field "Allow-Info".  An options tag
   "info-package" is also provided to enable the negotiation of this
   capability using SIP options negotiation.  The extension header field
   "Info-Type" is used in INFO requests to identify the type of
   information being transmitted in the request.

3. Applicability Statement

   The info package mechanism is applicable whenever an application
   makes use of the SIP INFO method.  Any pre-existing usage of the INFO
   method will require publictaion and usage of an appropriate INFO
   package for conformance with thsi document.

4. Allow-Info Header Field Definition and Syntax

   The Allow-Info header field is a SIP extension header field.  It is
   used in conjunction with SIP requests to which the response may
   instantiate a dialog (e.g., INVITE, SUBSCRIBE) and with responses to
   the SIP OPTIONS request to indicate support for a set of info
   packages by the application issuing the request or response.
   Multiple instances of the Allow-Info header field may be present in a
   request or response, in which case the value is equivalent to the
   unordered union of all values in the set of Allow-Info header fields.

   The syntax for Allow-Info is defined as follows:

   Allow-Info = "Allow-Info" HCOLON info-value * (COMMA) info-value )

   info-value = token

   Note that the value specified MUST be registered in the
   IANA-maintained INFO Packages Namespace registry specified in this
   document.

   Support for the Allow-Info header field MUST be indicated by the
   inclusion of the "info-package" option tag as a value in the
   Supported header field of the request or reponse containing the
   Allow-Info header field.

   Implementations conformant with this specification MUST include the
   options tag "info-package" in all "Supported" header fields, and
   SHOULD include a "Supported" header field in all requests.
   Furthermore, whenever "info-package" is indicated as supported in a
   request or response, conformant implementations MUST include an
   "Allow-Info" header field containing as values the registered info
   package names of all info packages supported by that implementation
   in the context of that specific request or response.

   The allowable usage of header fields is described in tables 2 and 3
   of RFC 3162 [5].  The following additions to this table are required:

                                Figure 1


5. Info-Type Header Field Definition and Syntax

   The Info-Type header field is a SIP extension header field.  It is
   used in conjunction with SIP INFO requests to indicate the specific
   Info Package relevant to the containing INFO request.

   The syntax for Info-Type is defined as follows:

   Info-Type = "Info-Type" HCOLON info-value

   info-value = token

   Note that the value specified MUST be registered in the
   IANA-maintained INFO Packages Namespace registry specified in this
   document.

   Support for the Info-Type header field MUST be indicated by the
   inclusion of the "info-package" option tag as a value in the
   Supported header field of the request or reponse containing the
   Allow-Info header field.

   Implementations conformant with this specification MUST include the
   options tag "info-package" in all "Supported" header fields, and
   SHOULD include a "Supported" header field in all requests.
   Imeplementations MUST include an "Info-Type" header field conatining
   as a )singular) value the registered Info Package na.

   The allowable usage of header fields is described in tables 2 and 3
   of RFC 3162 [5].  The following additions to this table are required:

6. Registration of Info Packages

   This document does not define any info packages.  Such packages will
   be defined by additional documents, published a standard,
   informational, experimental, or best-current-practice RFCs.  In
   accordnance with the SIP Change process as documented in
   draft-tsvarea-sipchange [7], such documented shoud be accorded expert
   review by the SIP Working Group or its successor under that process.

7. Usage

   The Info Package framework provides both for negotiating which info
   packages may be applied, and for declaring which INFO package is
   being applied to a specific INFO message.

7.1 Usage in Negotiation

   A SIP UA that understands Info Packages inserts the allow-info option
   tag as a value in a Supported header field.  A UA receiving a message
   containing an all-info option tag (that understands this option tag)
   therefore knows that the sender understands Info Packages and is
   prepared to receive an Info request qualified by the Info-Type
   headerfield.

   A SIP UA that understands Info=Packages and sends a request or
   response including an allow-info option tag also includes an
   Allow-Info header field listing as values the info packages it is
   willing to support.

   Consequently, usage of the allow-info option tag and the Allow-Info
   header field and associated values allows each UA in a dialog to
   positively discover that which of its peers in the dialog support
   Info Packages,and specifically which Info Packages they are willing
   to support.

Internet-Draft     SIP INFO Packaging and Negotiation       January 2002


7.2 Usage in INFO Deliveries

   A SIP UA sending an INFO request indicates the Info Package
   applicable to that request by including an Info-Type header field
   that contains a value indicating the specific Info Package being
   applied.

8. Security Considerations

   There are few security considerations for this draft beyond those in
   RFC 3162 [5].  In particular, the threat model and defenses specified
   therien apply.

   However, special guidance may be necessary for particular usages of
   INFO which may be specified in INFO packages documented and
   registered as described in this document.  Where appropriate, such
   packages must document any security considerations that apply to the
   associated usage of INFO.

9. IANA Considerations

9.1 Additions to Existing SIP Registries

   This document defines the SIP extension header field "Allow-Info",
   which IANA will add to the registry of SIP header fields defined in
   RFC 3162 [5].

   This document also defines a new SIP option tag "info-package" which
   IANA will add to the registry of SIP option tags defined in RFC 3162
   [5].

   The following is the registration for the Allow-Info header field:

      RFC Number: RFCXXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of
         this specification.]

      Header Field Name: Allow-Info

      Compact Form: none


   The following is the registration for the info-package option tag:

      RFC Number: RFCXXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of
         this specification.]

Internet-Draft     SIP INFO Packaging and Negotiation       January 2002



      Option Tag: info-package

9.2 INFO Package Registry

   This document defines a new registry for "SIP Info Packages
   Namespace" to be maintained by IANA.  This registry shall include the
   following fields:

      Package Name: The assigned name of the package.
      Contact: The name and email address of the registering party.
      Reference: The number of the RFC documenting the package.

   This document defines no packages to be added to this regisry, so
   this registry will initially be blank.  IANA is instructed to add
   packages to this registry upon publication of an RFC that defines the
   package name and its usage and directs IANA to add a package name to
   this registry.  Such RFCs MUST be reviewed by the SIP Working Group
   or its successor in accordance with the SIP Change Process defined in
   draft-tsvarea-sipchange [7].
