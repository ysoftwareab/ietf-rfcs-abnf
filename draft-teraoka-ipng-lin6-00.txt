Abstract

    This memo is the revised document of draft-teraoka-mobility-lin6-00.txt.
    LIN6 is a protocol based on IPv6 and supports mobility and multi-homing
    with IPsec by employing a new addressing architecture.  The title and
    the file name of this document have changed because the previous
    document dealt only with mobility support.

1.  Introduction

    This document describes the protocol specification of LIN6.  We propose
    LINA (Location Independent Network Architecture) to solve several
    problems such as mobility and multi-homing by redesigning network
    architecture and addressing.  LIN6 is an application of LINA to
    IPv6[RFC2460].  LIN6 supports mobility and multi-homing with
    IPsec[RFC2401] in IPv6.

    From mobility support viewpoint, LIN6 has several advantages in
    comparison with Mobile IPv6[MIPv6] as follows:

       o  LIN6 has no header overhead because it does not use any extension
          headers of IPv6 while Mobile IPv6 uses the Destination Options
          Header for the Home Address Option and the Routing Header for
          optimal routing.

       o  LIN6 is more fault tolerant than Mobile IPv6.  In Mobile IPv6, the
          Home Agent cannot be replicated to the subnet other than the home
          link of the mobile node.  LIN6 introduces the Mapping Agent which
          can be replicated anywhere in the Internet.

       o  LIN6 keeps end-to-end communication model, that is, LIN6 does not
          use any packet intercepter/forwarder such as the Home Agent of
          Mobile IPv6.  There is no tunneling in LIN6.

    LIN6 also has several advantages from multi-homing support viewpoint.
    Assume that Node-A starts TCP communication with Node-B, a multi-homing
    node with two network interfaces, by using IPsec.

       o  Node-A can recognize the identity of Node-B by the LIN6 address of
          Node-B no matter which network interface of Node-B is used.

       o  The same security association (SA) can be used between Node-A and
          Node-B no matter which network interface of Node-B is used.

       o  The TCP connection and the SA are still available even after the
          used network interface of Node-B is switched to another during
          communication.


2.  Terminology

    This document uses the following terms.

       node:
          The node is the general term to specify the equipment that
          understands IP in the Internet.  The node includes hosts, mobile
          terminals, routers, and so on.

       LIN6 ID:

draft-teraoka-ipng-lin6-00.txt                             23 February 2001


          The LIN6 ID is assigned to the node and uniquely identifies the
          node in the Internet.  It is 64 bits in length.

       LIN6 prefix:
          The LIN6 prefix is a predefined constant value attached to the
          head of the LIN6 ID to construct the LIN6 generalized ID.

       LIN6 generalized ID:
          The LIN6 generalized ID is the identifier of the node used in the
          transport layer and the upper layers.  It is 128 bits in length.
          The higher 64 bits of the LIN6 generalized ID is the LIN6 prefix
          and the lower 64 bits is the LIN6 ID.  The LIN6 generalized ID is
          assigned to the node, not to the network interface.  Application
          programs use the LIN6 generalized ID to indicate the target node.
          TCP establishes the TCP connection between two LIN6 generalized
          IDs.  Note that the LIN6 generalized ID does not appear in the
          IPv6 header on the link.

       network prefix:
          The network prefix indicates the subnet to which the node is
          connected.  It is attached to the head of the LIN6 ID to construct
          the LIN6 address.

       LIN6 address:
          The LIN6 address is assigned to the network interface of the node.
          The higher 64 bits of the LIN6 address is the network prefix and
          the lower 64 bits is the LIN6 ID so that the LIN6 address
          specifies the identifier of the node as well as the point of
          attachment to the Internet of the node.  Note that the LIN6
          address appears in the IPv6 header on the link and is not passed
          to the transport layer.

       mapping:
          The mapping is the relation between the LIN6 ID and the network
          prefix.

       Mapping Agent:
          The Mapping Agent (MA) is the function that maintains the mapping
          of the mobile node.  Each mobile node is associated with one or
          more Mapping Agents.  The relation between the LIN6 ID of the
          mobile node and the address of the Mapping Agent is registered
          with the DNS.

       Mapping Cache:
          The Mapping Cache is the cache for mapping in the node.

       normal IPv6 address:
          The aggregatable global unicast address.

3.  Protocol Overview

3.1.  Address

    LIN6 uses two types of network addresses: the LIN6 generalized ID and
    the LIN6 address.  Figure 1 depicts their formats.  The LIN6 generalized
    ID is 128 bits in length and is used in the transport layer and the
    upper layers.  LIN6 generalized ID is the identifier of the node in the
    transport layer and the upper layers and does not change even if the
    node moves.  The LIN6 address is also 128 bits in length and is used in
    the network layer.  The LIN6 address specifies both the location and the
    identifier of the node.  The network prefix part of the LIN6 address
    changes when the node moves to anther subnet.  The formats of the LIN6
    generalized ID and the LIN6 address are the same as the format of IPv6
    aggregatable global unicast address[RFC2374].


                    <-------- 64 bits --------> <-------- 64 bits ------->
       LIN6        +---------------------------+--------------------------+
       generalized |   LIN6 prefix (constant)  |          LIN6-ID         |
       ID          +---------------------------+--------------------------+

                   +---------------------------+--------------------------+
      LIN6 address |      network prefix       |          LIN6-ID         |
                   +---------------------------+--------------------------+

    aggregatable   +--+------+---+------+------+--------------------------+
    global unicast |FP|TLA ID|res|NLA ID|SLA ID|     Interface ID         |
    address        +--+------+---+------+------+--------------------------+

             Figure 1: The LIN6 generalized ID and the LIN6 address


    Both the LIN6 generalized ID and the LIN6 address consist of two fields:
    the network prefix and the LIN6 ID.  Both fields are 64 bits in length.
    The LIN6 ID is the global unique identifier of the node.  EUI-64[EUI64]
    will be used as LIN6-ID.  The network prefix of the LIN6 address
    indicates the subnet to which the node is connected while that of the
    LIN6 generalized ID is the constant value and is called the LIN6 prefix.
    In other words, the LIN6 address indicates both the location and the
    identifier of the node while the LIN6 generalized only identifies the
    node.  Thus, the LIN6 generalized ID is used in the transport layer and
    the upper layers to identify the node, and the LIN6 address is used in
    the network layer to indicate both the location and the identifier of
    the node.  Note that the LIN6 ID and the LIN6 generalized ID are
    assigned per node while the LIN6 address is assigned per network
    interface.  Also note that the normal IPv6 address, i.e., the
    aggregatable global unicast address, is assigned to the network
    interface of the node in addition to the LIN6 address.

3.2.  Address Processing

    Figure 2 shows the procedures of address processing.  As mentioned
    above, the LIN6 generalized ID consists of the (constant) LIN6 prefix
    and the LIN6 ID.  In packet transmission, the transport layer specifies
    the LIN6 generalized ID of the destination node to the network layer.
    The network layer obtains the network prefix, i.e., the current
    location, of the destination node by some means (see Section 3.3).  The
    network layer concatenates the obtained network prefix and the LIN6 ID
    contained in the LIN6 generalized ID to create the LIN6 address of the
    destination node.

    In packet reception, the source address field of the packet contains the
    LIN6 address of the source node.  The network layer concatenates the
    LIN6 prefix and the LIN6 ID contained in the LIN6 address of the source
    node to create the LIN6 generalized ID, and then the network layer
    notifies the transport layer of the packet reception with the LIN6
    generalized ID of the source node.  Thus, from the transport layer's
    viewpoint, communication is done between the two LIN6 generalized IDs.

3.3.  Distinction between the LIN6 Address and the Normal IPv6 Address

    As shown on the right side of Figure 2, the receiving node must
    distinguish the LIN6 address from the normal IPv6 address to decide
    whether address conversion must be done.  From address format viewpoint,
    however, the LIN6 address is indistinguishable from the normal IPv6
    address.  (i.e., LIN6 is fully compatible with IPv6.) There are some
    methods to distinguish the two address types.  As a temporary solution,
    LIN6 employs a special value as a part of the LIN6 ID.  To distinguish
    the LIN6 address, Sony CSL obtained the OUI value 0x00-01-4A of EUI-
    64[EUI64].  Thus, if the upper 24 bits of the lower 64 bits of the IPv6
    address is 0x00-01-4A, the IPv6 address is the LIN6 address.

3.4.  Mapping Agent

    The relation between the LIN6 ID and the network prefix is called
    mapping.  LIN6 introduces the Mapping Agent (MA) to maintain the mapping
    of the mobile node.  The Mapping Agent maintains the mapping of the
    mobile node and replies to queries about mapping.  Each mobile node is
    associated with one or more Mapping Agents.  When the network prefix of
    the mobile node changes, i.e., when the mobile node moves, the mobile
    node registers the new network prefix with one of the Mapping Agents
    that maintain the mapping of the mobile node.  Consistency among the
    databases on the Mapping Agents must be kept by some procedures.  These
    procedures are beyond of the scope of this document.

    It can be assumed that the relation between the mobile node and its
    Mapping Agent is almost static in contrast to the mapping of the mobile
    node.  LIN6 makes use of the Domain Name System (DNS) to maintain the
    relation between the mobile node and its Mapping Agents.  A new DNS
    record MA is introduced to register the address of the Mapping Agent of
    the mobile node with the DNS database.


3.5.  Communication Procedure

    The LIN6 Communication procedure is shown in Figure 3.  Assume that
    Node-A tries to send a packet to Node-B.  For simplicity, Node-A and
    Node-B are associated with only a single Mapping Agent, respectively
    (MA-A and MA-B).  The communication procedure is as follows:

       1. At first, Node-A and Node-B register their network prefixes with
          MA-A and MA-B, respectively.  The Authentication Header of IPv6 is
          used in registration.

       2. The Node-A obtains the address (AAAA record) of Node-B from the
          name server by indicating the domain name of Node-B.  The obtained
          address is the LIN6 generalized ID of Node-B.

       3. Node-A obtains the address of MA-B from the name server by
          indicating the LIN6 generalized ID of Node-B.

       4. Node-A obtains the network prefix of Node-B from MA-B by
          indicating the LIN6 ID of Node-B.

       5. Node-A sends a packet to Node-B.

       6. To avoid impersonation, Node-B must obtain the network prefix of
          Node-A from MA-A.  Node-B obtains the address of MA-A from the
          name server by indicating the LIN6 generalized ID of Node-A.

       7. Node-B obtains the network prefix of Node-A from MA-A by
          indicating the LIN6 ID of Node-A.

3.6.  IPsec Operation

    In the sending node, IPsec is processed as follows.  When the packet is
    passed from the transport layer, the source and destination address
    fields in the IPv6 header contain LIN6 generalized IDs.  The security
    association is decided by using the destination LIN6 generalized ID, and
    then IPsec calculation is executed.  After that, the source and
    destination LIN6 generalized IDs are converted to LIN6 addresses.

    In the receiving node, IPsec is processed as follows.  Upon packet
    reception, the source and destination address fields of IPv6 header
    contain LIN6 addresses.  First, these LIN6 addresses are converted to
    LIN6 generalized IDs.  The security association is decided by using the
    destination LIN6 generalized ID, and then IPsec calculation is executed.


3.7.  Mobility Support

    Mobility support in LIN6 is shown in Figure 4.  Assume that SAs are
    established between the mobile node (MN) and the correspondent node
    (CN), and between the MN and the MA.

       1. The MN registers its current network prefix with the Mapping Agent
          (MA).  The Authentication Header is used in this registration.

       2. The CN obtains the LIN6 address and MA's address from the name
          server.

       3. The CN obtains MN's network prefix from the MA.

       4. The CN sends a packet to the MN.  The source address of this
          packet is the normal IPv6 address because the CN is stationary in
          this case.

       5. The MN returns a packet to the CN.  The source address of the
          received packet is used as the destination address of the return
          packet because the source address of the received packet is the
          normal IPv6 address.

       6. The MN moves to another subnet.

       7. The MN registers the new network prefix with the MA and the CN.
          The Authentication Header is used in these registrations.

       8. The CN sends a packet to the MN.

3.8.  Multi-Homing Support

    Figure 6 shows multi-homing support in LIN6.  In the figure, Node-B is a
    multi-homing host which has two network interfaces.  Node-A and Node-B
    have the LIN6 generalized ID, "LIN6_P+ID_A" and "LIN6_P+ID_B",
    respectively, where "LIN6_P" is the LIN6 Prefix, and "ID_A" and "ID_B"
    are the identifiers of Node-A and Node-B, respectively.  Node-A has the
    LIN6 address, "P_A+ID_A", where "P_A" is the network prefix of Node-A.
    Node-B has two LIN6 addresses, "P_B1+ID_B" and "P_B2+ID_B", where "P_B1"
    and "P_B2" are the network prefixes of Node-B corresponding to the two
    network interfaces.

       1. Node-A establishes a TCP connection with Node-B by using IPsec.
          This TCP connection is established between {LIN6_P+ID_A, port_A}
          and {LIN6_P+ID_B, port_B}.  The SA of IPsec is established between
          "LIN6_P+ID_A" and "LIN6_P+ID_B".  Assume that Node-A obtains
          "P_B1" and "P_B2" as the network prefixes of Node-B and selects
          "P_B1".  The packet in the TCP connection has "P_A+ID_A" and
          "P_B1+ID_B" as the source/destination addresses.  The packets in
          the TCP connection traverse Path_A in the figure.

       2. Assume that Path_A crashes due to some reason, and ICMP Unreach is
          returned to Node-A.

       3. Node-A knows that Path_A is unavailable and selects "P_B2" as the
          network prefix of Node-B.  The packet in the TCP connection has
          "P_A+ID_A" and "P_B2+ID_B" as the source/destination addresses.
          The packets in the TCP connection traverse Path_B in the figure.
          Although the LIN6 address of Node-B changes, the TCP connection
          and the SA are still available even after the path change because
          the TCP connection is established between {LIN6_P+ID_A, port_A}
          and {LIN6_P+ID_B}, and the SA is established between "LIN6_P+ID_A"

4.2.  Mapping Update and Reply Messages

    When a mobile node moves to another subnet, i.e., when the network
    prefix of the mobile node changes, the mobile node sends the Mapping
    Update Message to the Mapping Agent and the correspondent nodes.  Upon
    receiving the Mapping Update Message, the Mapping Agent or the
    correspondent node returns the Mapping Reply Message to the mobile node.
    The Mapping Update and Reply Messages are UDP packets.  The
    Authentication Header of IPv6 must be included in the Mapping Update
    Message to avoid illegal mapping update.  Figure 8 shows the formats of
    the Mapping Update and Reply Messages.

4.3.  MA Query and Reply Messages

    When a node wants to send a packet to a mobile node, the node sends the
    MA Query Message to the Mapping Agent to obtain the current network
    prefix of the mobile node.  When the Mapping Agent receives the MA Query
    Message, it returns the MA Reply Message to the node to notify the
    network prefix of the mobile node.  Figure 9 shows the format of the MA
    Query and Reply Messages.

       Lifetime: the period of time in which this mapping is valid.



4.4.  I_Have_Moved Message

    Figure 10 shows the format of the I_Have_Moved Message.  When the
    network prefix of a node changes due to, for example, node movement, if
    there is no security association between the node and the correspondent
    node, the node sends the I_Have_Moved Message to the correspondent node.
    Upon receiving the I_Have_Moved Message, the receiving node sends the MA
    Query Message to obtain the new network prefix of the node sending the
    I_Have_Moved Message.

5.1.  Bootstrap

    When the mobile node is powered on, it obtains the network prefix of the
    subnet to which it is connected by sending the Router Solicitation
    Message[RFC2461] and receiving the Router Advertisement Message.  Next,
    the mobile node sends a DNS query packet to obtain the address of the
    Mapping Agent that maintains the mapping of the mobile node.  Next, the
    mobile node establishes a security association of IPsec[RFC2401] with
    the Mapping Agent.  Next, the mobile node sends the Mapping Update
    Request Message to the Mapping Agent to register the current network
    prefix and receives the Mapping Update Reply Message.


5.2.  Processing on Movement

    The mobile node detects the change of the point of attachment to the
    Internet by some mechanisms, for example, 1) interrupt by hardware, 2)
    upcall from the link layer, and 3) router advertisement message.  When
    the mobile node detects a location change, first, it sends the Router
    Solicitation Message and receives the Router Advertisement Message to
    obtain the network prefix of the subnet to which the mobile node is
    connected.  Next, the mobile node sends the Mapping Update Request
    Message to the Mapping Agent to notify the current network prefix.  The
    mobile node also sends the Mapping Update Request Message to the
    correspondent nodes with which it has a security association.  The
    Mapping Update Request Message must include the Authentication Header.
    The mobile node sends the I_Have_Moved Message to the correspondent
    nodes with which it has no security association.


6.  Processing on Mapping Agent

    Upon receiving the Mapping Update Request Message from the mobile node,
    first, the Mapping Agent makes it sure that the Authentication Header is
    correct.  If authentication fails, the Mapping Agent returns the Mapping
    Update Reply Message with the error code Authentication Failed.  If
    authentication succeeds, the Mapping Agent updates the mapping of the
    mobile node and returns the Mapping Update Reply Message to the mobile
    node.

    If the mobile node is associated with two or more Mapping Agents,
    consistency among the databases on the Mapping Agents must be kept by
    some procedures.  These procedures are beyond of the scope of this
    document.


7.  Packet Transmission and Reception

7.1.  Packet Transmission

    When the network layer receives a packet transmission request from the



Teraoka                   Expires 23 August 2001                  [Page 17]
draft-teraoka-ipng-lin6-00.txt                             23 February 2001


    transport layer, the network layer makes sure that the destination
    address passed from the TCP/UDP is a LIN6 generalized ID or a normal
    IPv6 address by checking the upper 64 bits of the destination address.
    If the destination address is a normal IPv6 address, the network layer
    executes the normal IPv6 transmission procedure.  If the destination
    address is a LIN6 generalized ID, the network layer executes the LIN6
    procedure described below.

    The network layer extracts the LIN6 ID from the LIN6 generalized ID and
    searches the Mapping Cache for the network prefix by using the LIN6 ID
    as the key.  If the network prefix is found, the network layer
    concatenates the network prefix and the LIN6 ID to create the LIN6
    address of the destination node.  After that, the network layer executes
    the normal IPv6 transmission procedure.

    If the network prefix of the destination node is not found in the
    Mapping Cache, the node keeps the packet waiting for transmission, and
    then sends the MA Query Message to the Mapping Agent to obtain the
    network prefix.  If the source node does not know the address of the
    Mapping Agent, it obtains the Mapping Agent's address from the name
    server by indicating the LIN6 ID of the destination address.  Upon
    receiving the MA Reply Message, the node creates the LIN6 address of the
    destination node, and then executes the normal IPv6 transmission
    procedure.


7.2.  Packet Reception

    When the network layer receives a packet from the link layer, first the
    network layer makes sure that the source address of the IPv6 header is a
    LIN address or a normal IPv6 address.  Refer to the next subsection
    about how to distinguish between the LIN6 address and the normal IPv6
    address.  If the source address is the normal IPv6 address, the network
    layer executes the normal IPv6 reception procedure.

    If the source address is the LIN6 address, the network layer removes the
    network prefix part of the LIN6 address, and then attaches the LIN6
    prefix to create the LIN6 generalized ID of the source node.  After
    that, the network layer executes the normal IPv6 reception procedure.


7.3.  I_Have_Moved Message Reception

    When a node receives the I_Have_Moved Message, it sends the MA Query
    Message to the Mapping Agent of the node sending the I_Have_Moved
    Message.  If the node does not know the address of the Mapping Agent, it
    obtains the Mapping Agent's address from the name server by indicating
    the LIN6 ID of the node sending the I_Have_Moved Message.

    applications that have been FILED to the Japanese Patent office.

       - Japanese application No.2000-005560 Sony

       - Japanese application No.2000-036693 Toshiba

    These include the mapping agent and address processing mechanisms. It
    must be stressed that they have only been filed, and have not been
    granted. They have been filed separately by Sony and Toshiba.

    We really intend to contribute to development of the Internet community
    and to keep a good relationship with IETF. And our primary concern is to
    promote our technology so that others may feel it is useful and
    worthwhile in the spirit of the IETF.

    If indeed the mechanisms are granted as patents, the patents will be
    licensed under reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions to any
    person who wants to implement the mechanisms.
