     2.  Abstract

     This document specifies a set of RADIUS attributes designed to support
     the provision of mandatory  tunneling  in  dial-up  networks.   RADIUS
     attributes for both authorization and accounting are specified.



     3.  Introduction

     Many  of the most interesting applications of tunneling protocols such
     as PPTP [PPTP] and L2TP [L2TP] involve dial-up network access.   Some,
     such  as the provision of secure access to corporate intranets via the
     Internet, are characterized by voluntary tunneling: the tunnel is cre-
     ated at the request of the user for a specific purpose.  Other, poten-
     tially more compelling, applications involve compulsory tunneling: the
     tunnel  is created automatically, without any action from the user and
     more importantly, without allowing the user any choice in the  matter.
     Examples  of  applications  that might be implemented using compulsory
     tunnels are Internet software upgrade servers,  software  registration
     servers  and  banking services.  These are all services which, without

     compulsory tunneling, would probably be provided using dedicated  net-
     works  or  at least dedicated network access servers (NAS), since they
     are characterized by the need to limit user access to specific  hosts.
     Given  the  existence  of widespread support for compulsory tunneling,
     however, these types of services could be accessed via  virtually  any
     Internet  service provider (ISP).  The most popular means of authoriz-
     ing dial-up network users today is through the RADIUS  protocol.   The
     use  of RADIUS allows the dial-up users' authorization and authentica-
     tion data to be maintained in a central location,  rather  than  being
     subject to manual configuration.  It makes sense to use RADIUS to cen-
     trally  administer  compulsory  tunneling,  since  RADIUS  is   widely
     deployed  and  was  designed  to  carry this type of information.  New
     RADIUS attributes are needed to carry the tunneling  information  from
     the  RADIUS server to the NAS and to transfer accounting data from the
     NAS to the RADIUS server; this document defines those attributes.


     4.  Attributes

     4.1.  Tunnel-Type

        Description

           This Attribute indicates the tunneling protocol to be used.   It
           MAY be used in both Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.  A
           NAS is not required to implement all of these tunnel types,  and
           MUST  treat  unknown  or  unsupported  Tunnel-Types as though an
           Access-Reject had been received instead.

        A summary of the Tunnel-Type Attribute format is shown below.   The
        fields are transmitted from left to right.

        Description

           The   Tunnel-Medium-Type  Attribute  indicates  which  transport
           medium to use when creating a tunnel for those  protocols  (such
           as L2TP) that can operate over multiple transports.

        below.  The fields are transmitted left to right.

           The format of  the  address  represented  by  the  String  field
           depends  upon  the  value  of  the Tunnel-Medium-Type attribute.
           This attribute, along with the Tunnel-Server-Endpoint  and  Tun-
           nel-ID  attributes,  may  be  used  to provide a globally unique
           means to identify a tunnel for accounting purposes.


     4.4.  Tunnel-Server-Endpoint

        Description

           This Attribute indicates the address of the server  end  of  the
           tunnel.

        A  summary  of the Tunnel-Server-Endpoint Attribute format is shown
        below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.
