Internet-Draft  PS of IPv4 Support for PMIPv6 local routing   June 2009


Abstract

   [ID-PMIP6-RO-PS] describes the problem space of localized routing
   which allows end-to-end user traffic forwarding between MN and CN
   directly without involving Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a single
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] domain. However, localized routing with
   IPv4 support which allows IPv4 transport between MAG and LMA and/or
   IPv4 enabled user traffic between MN and CN is not considered. This
   document details the scenarios and problem statement for localized
   routing with IPv4 support.

Internet-Draft  PS of IPv4 Support for PMIPv6 local routing   June 2009




1. Introduction

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is
   responsible for forwarding the user traffic from the correspondent
   node to the current location of registered mobile nodes. To reduce
   latency and backhaul load, optimized routing path without involving
   LMA in path is expected. [ID-PMIP6-RO-PS] has outlined some possible
   problems during setting up an optimized routing path between MN and
   CN which requires that MN and CN are connected to same PMIP domain.
   However, the scenarios and problems for the IPv4 support of PMIP6
   localized routing [ID-PMIP6-IPv4] are not specified.

   As [ID-PMIP6-IPv4] described, PMIPv6 with IPv4 support contains two
   basic features: IPv4 transport support and IPv4 HoA support. This
   document details these scenarios and describes its relevant problems
   during setting up an optimized routing path. In these IPv4 support
   localized routing scenarios, it allows a MN and a CN subscription
   belong to different operators.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology of [RFC5213].  The following terms
   are used in the context of this problem statement:

   o Routing Optimization (RO): referred as the functionality that
      makes end-to-end user traffic between the MN and the CN go through
      an optimized routing path in the same PMIPv6 domain.

   o Routing Optimization Path (ROP): the direct MAG-to-MAG path for a
      user traffic between the MAG the MN is attached to and the MAG the
      CN is attached to.

   o Routing Optimization States (ROS): referred as RO information that
      is generally stored in the corresponding LMA(s) and MAG(s). Such
      information includes RO policies and tunnel ID of ROP, etc.

   o Routing Optimization Control (ROC): the ROP setting up and the ROS
      management done by the PMIPv6 network entities participating to
      the RO.

3. Scenarios and Problem Statement

   Fig.1 shows a generic IPv4 support architecture. In this architecture,
   the end-to-end user traffic routing is allowed between MN and CN (CN1,
   CN2 or CN3). To make the description simple, we have the following
   general assumptions to this architecture.

   -  LMA1 and LMA2 which MN and CN are respectively anchored to may be
   the same LMA or different LMA in the same PMIPv6 domain.

   -  With IPv4 user traffic support, MN and CN both are IPv4-only
   enabled nodes or dual stack nodes.

   -  With IPv4 transport support, we assume IPv4 network is deployed
   between LMA1 and MAG1. However, the transport network between LMA2
   and MAG2, MAG1 and MAG2 is not limited to IPv4 network.

                        Fig.1 IPv4 support architecture

   Based on the assumption mentioned above, we have the following three
   use cases on IPv4 support for PMIPv6 localized routing.

   Case 1: Both MN and CN attached MAGs are using IPv4 transport

   In this case, the PMIPv6 signaling between MAGs and LMAs for MN and
   CN is carried over IPv4 network. The end-to-end user traffic between
   MN and CN can be IPv4 or IPv6 application. With IPv4 transport
   support, the NAT may exist between MAG1 and MAG2 or between the LMA1
   and LMA2.

   Case 2: MN and CN attached MAGs are using IPv4 transport and IPv6
   transport respectively

   In this case, the PMIPv6 signaling between MAG1 and LMA1 for MN is
   carried over IPv4 network while the PMIP6 signaling between MAG2 and
   LMA2 for CN is carried over IPv6 network. The end-to-end user traffic
   between MN and CN can be IPv4 or IPv6 application. With the IPv4
   transport support, the NAT may exist between MAG1 and MAG2 or between
   the LMA1 and LMA2.

   Case 3: Both MN and CN are IPv4 enabled nodes

   In this case, MN is using IPv4 address to communicate with CN through
   the direct path between the MN and CN's MAGs located in the same
   PMIP6 domain. The end-to-end user traffic between MN and CN belongs
   to the IPv4 application. Furthermore, MN and CN may be attached to
   the same or different MAGs. MN and CN attached MAGs communicate with
   the LMAs using IPv6 transport.

   Case 4: Roaming user MN and non-roaming user CN subscription belong
   to different Operators
   In this case, Roaming user MN moves to the visited network owned by
   the operator using IPv4 transport where no-roaming CN is located. MN
   and CN are under the same PMIP6 domain. However, MN and CN
   subscription belong to the different operators.

   Case 5: Both MN and CN are "roaming" and using visited network LMAs
   In this case, both MN and CN moves to the same visited network owned
   by the operator using IPv4 transport. MN and CN are roaming users and
   both using visited network LMAs. However MN and CN subscription
   belong to the different operators.

   On the basis of the above use cases, we have several problems of IPv4
   Support for PMIPv6 localized routing to be considered below.

   o P1: NAT Detection





Wu                   Expires December 23, 2009               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  PS of IPv4 Support for PMIPv6 local routing   June 2009


   For IPv4 transport support, when the IPv4 network is deployed between
   both MAG(s) in an optimized routing path, NAT [RFC3022] device may be
   located. In general, [ID-DSMIP6] for detecting the on-path NAT device
   may be applicable for ROP setup. However, if there existing NAT
   between the MAGs associated with the MN and CN and the MAG is not
   aware of it, the NAT may automatically drop the user traffic between
   the MN and CN and prevent setting up localized routing path.

   o P2: Encapsulation Mode Negotiation

   There may be some situations where MN communicates with CN using the
   direct path between the MAGs to which both MN and CN attached and
   such MAGs support different tunnel encapsulation or transport (e.g.,
   IPv4 over IPv6 transport, IPv6 over IPv4 transport, IPv6 over IPv4
   UDP). In such cases, there may be various encapsulation modes existed
   between MAG1 and MAG2 for choice. Therefore, it is expected to
   negotiate and determine the appropriate encapsulation mode for end-
   to-end user traffic routing between MN and CN during ROC processing.


   o P3: IPv4 address space overlapping

   There may be some situations where mobile nodes from different
   operators may be assigned the same IPv4 HoA from overlapping private
   address space. In PMIPv6 domain, the MAG and the LMA can distinguish
   each mobile node flow based on the GRE key encapsulated within the
   tunneled packet [ID-PMIP-GREKEY], even though two mobile nodes are
   assigned the same IPv4 HoA. However, when the traffic destined for
   the CNs with same HoA does not pass through the tunnel between the
   MAG and the LMA and go directly to the path between the MAGs
   associated with MN and CN, the MAG attached by the CN can not
   identify the right CN based on the overlapped IPv4 HoA in the
   destination field of the incoming packet, therefore can not forward
   the user traffic to the right CN.


   o P4: IP Protocol Version Transition

Internet-Draft  PS of IPv4 Support for PMIPv6 local routing   June 2009


   There may be some situations where the IPv4 network is deployed
   between both MAG(s) in an optimized routing path and the IPv6 network
   is deployed between the MAG and the LMA, in such cases, once the
   local routing is allowed between both MAG(s) and the traffic from the
   MN or CN does not pass through the LMA and is sent directly to the
   corresponding MAG, the dual stack MAG needs to transit from the IPv6
   transport version to the IPv4 transport version ,e.g., change the
   destination address of the packet from IPv6-Proxy-CoA to IPv4-Proxy-
   CoA. This change should be considered during ROC processing.

   o P5: ROS Maintaining

   For IPv4 support, the ROS should include the additional source/
   destination IPv4 address or the transport IPv4 address (e.g. IPv4-
   Proxy-CoA), etc. Further more, RO policy (e.g. whether per-MN based
   RO is enabled or disabled) may be downloaded from AAA as an attribute
   of ROS and maintained locally in the ROS.


4. Security Considerations

   The scenarios and problems specified in this document can use the
   security association between the LMA and the MAG to create security
   association between MAGs associated with the MN and CN in the
   communication.
