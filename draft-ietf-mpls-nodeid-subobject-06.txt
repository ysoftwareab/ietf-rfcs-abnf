Abstract 
 
In the context of MPLS TE Fast Reroute, the Merge Point (MP) address is 
required at the Point of Local Repair (PLR) in order to select a backup 
tunnel intersecting a fast reroutable Traffic Engineering Label 
Switched Path (TE LSP) on a downstream Label Switch Router (LSR).  
However, existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to find an MP 
address in multi-domain routing networks where a domain is defined as 
an IGP area or an Autonomous System. Hence, the current MPLS Fast 
Reroute mechanism cannot be used to protect inter-domain TE LSPs from a 
failure of an ABR (Area Border Router) or ASBR (Autonomous System 
Border Router) respectively. This document specifies the use of 
existing Route Record Object (RRO) IPv4 and IPv6 sub-objects (with a 
new flag defined) thus defining the node-id subobject in order to solve 
this issue. Note that the MPLS Fast reroute mechanism mentioned in this 
document refers to the "Facility backup" MPLS TE Fast Reroute method.

2. Introduction    

MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) ([FAST-REROUTE]) is a fast recovery local 
protection technique used to protect Traffic Engineering LSPs from 
link/SRLG/node failure.  One or more backup tunnels are pre-established 
to protect against the failure of a link/node/SRLG. In case of failure,

every protected TE LSP traversing the failed resource is rerouted onto 
the appropriate backup tunnels in tens of msecs. 
 
There are several requirements on the backup tunnel path that must be 
satisfied. First, the backup tunnel must not traverse the element that 
it protects. Additionally, a primary tunnel and its associated backup 
tunnel should intersect at least at two points (nodes): Point of Local 
Repair (PLR) and Merge Point (MP). The former should be the head-end 
LSR of the backup tunnel and the latter should be the tail-end LSR of 
the backup tunnel. The PLR is where FRR is triggered when 
link/node/SRLG failure happens.  
 
There are different methods for computing paths for backup tunnels at a 
given PLR. Specifically, a user can statically configure one or more 
backup tunnels at the PLR with an explicitly configured path or the PLR 
can be configured to automatically compute a backup path or to send a 
path computation request to a PCE. 
 
Consider the following scenario (figure 1) 
 
Assumptions: 
- A multi-area network made of three areas: 0, 1 and 2, 
- A fast reroutable TE LSP T1 (TE LSP signaled with the "local 
Protection desired" bit set in the SESSION-ATTRIBUTE object or the 
FAST-REROUTE object) from R0 to R3, 
- A backup tunnel B1 from R1 to R2, not traversing ABR1, and following 
the R1-ABR3-R2 path.  
- The PLR R1 reroutes any protected TE LSP traversing ABR1 onto the 
backup tunnel B1 in case of ABR1's failure. 
 
           <--- area 1 --><---area 0---><---area 2---> 
              R0-----R1-ABR1--R2------ABR2--------R3 
                     \        / 
                      \      / 
                        ABR3 
 
Figure 1: Use of Fast Reroute to protect a TE LSP against an ABR 
failure with MPLS Traffic Engineering Fast Reroute 
 
When T1 is first signaled, the PLR R1 needs to dynamically select an 
appropriate backup tunnel intersecting T1 on a downstream LSR. However, 
existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to unambiguously find 
the MP address in a network with inter-domain TE LSP. Note that 
although the example above was given in the context of inter-area TE 
LSPs, a similar reasoning applies to the case of inter-AS TE LSP. This 
document addresses these limitations.  
 
R1 needs to ensure the following:  
 
  1. The backup tunnel intersects with the primary tunnel at the MP 
     (and thus has a valid MP address). For the sake of illustration, 
 
Vasseur, Ali and Sivabalan                                    4 
 

 
draft-ietf-mpls-nodeid-subobject-06.txt                        May 2005 
 
 
     in Figure 1, R1 needs to determine that T1 and B1 share the same 
     MP node R2. 
 
  2. The backup tunnel satisfies the primary LSP's request with 
     respect to the bandwidth protection request (i.e., bandwidth 
     guaranteed for the primary tunnel during failure), and the type 
     of protection (preferably, protecting against a node failure 
     versus a link failure), as specified in [FAST-REROUTE]. 
 
A PLR can make sure that condition (1) is met by examining the Record 
Route Object (RRO) of the primary tunnel to see if any of the addresses 
specified in the RRO is attached to the tail-end of the backup tunnel. 
As per [RSVP-TE], the addresses specified in the RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-
objects sent in Resv messages can be node-ids and/or interface 
addresses. Hence, in Figure 1, router R2 may specify interface 
addresses in the RROs for T1 and B1. Note that these interface 
addresses are different in this example.  
 
The problem of finding the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids 
can be easily solved in the case of a single IGP area. Specifically, in 
the case of a single IGP area, the PLR has the knowledge of all the 
interfaces attached to the tail-end of the backup tunnel. This 
information is available in PLR's IGP topology database. Thus, the PLR 
can unambiguously determine whether a backup tunnel intersecting a 
protected TE LSP on a downstream node exists and can also find the MP 
address regardless of how the addresses carried in the RRO IPv4 or IPv6 
sub-objects are specified (i.e., whether using the interface addresses 
or the node-ids). However, such routing information is not available in 
the case of inter-domain environments. Hence, unambiguously making sure 
that condition (1) above is met in the case of inter-domain TE LSPs is 
not possible with existing mechanisms. 
 
In this document, we define extensions to and describe the use of RSVP 
[RSVP, RSVP-TE] to solve the above-mentioned problem. Note that the 
requirement for the support of the fast recovery technique specified in 
[FAST-REROUTE] to inter-domain TE LSPs has been specified in [INTER-
AREA-TE-REQS] and [INTER-AREA-TE-REQS]. 
 
2.     Signaling node-ids in RROs
 
As mentioned above, the limitation that we need to address is the 
generality of the contents of the RRO IPv4 and IPv6 sub-objects, as 
defined in [RSVP-TE]. [RSVP-TE] defines the IPv4 and IPv6 RRO sub-
objects. Moreover, two additional flags are defined in [FAST-REROUTE]: 
the "Local Protection Available" and "Local protection in use" bits. 
 
In this document, we define the following new flag: 
 
Node-id: 0x20 
 
 
Vasseur, Ali and Sivabalan                                    5 
 

 
draft-ietf-mpls-nodeid-subobject-06.txt                        May 2005 
 
 
      When set, this indicates that the address specified in the 
      RRO's IPv4 or IPv6 subobject is a node-id address, which refers 
      to the "Router Address" as defined in [OSPF-TE], or "Traffic 
      Engineering Router ID" as defined in [ISIS-TE]. A node MUST use 
      the same address consistently. Once an address is used in RRO's 
      IPv4 or IPv6 subobject, it should always be used for the 
      lifetime of the LSP. 
 
An IPv4 or IPv6 RRO subobject with the node-id flag set is also called 
a node-id subobject. The problem of finding a MP address in a network 
with inter-domain TE LSP is solved by inserting a node-id subobject (an 
RRO "IPv4" and "IPv6" sub-object with the 0x20 flag set) in the RRO 
object carried in the RSVP Resv message. 
       
An implementation may either decide to:  
 
1) Add the node-id subobject in an RSVP Resv message and, when 
required, also add another IPv4/IPv6 subobject to record interface 
address. 
 
Example: an inter-domain fast reroutable TE LSP would have in the RRO 
object carried in Resv message two sub-objects: a node-id subobject and 
a label sub-object. If recording the interface address is required, 
then an additional IPv4/IPv6 subobject is added.  
 
2) Add an IPv4/IPv6 sub-object recording the interface address and, 
when required, add a node-id subobject in the RRO object. 
 
Example: an inter-domain fast reroutable TE LSP would have in the RRO 
object carried in Resv message three sub-objects: an IPv4/IPv6 sub-
object recording interface address, a label sub-object and a node-id 
sub-object. 
 
Note also that the node-id sub-object may have other application than 
Fast Reroute backup tunnel selection. Moreover, it is RECOMMENDED that 
an LSR recording a node-id address in an IPv4/IPv6 RRO sub-object also 
set the Node-id flag. 
 
3.     Finding Merge Point                                   
 
Two cases should be considered: 
 
- Case 1: the backup tunnel destination is the MP's node-id. Then a PLR 
can find the MP and suitable backup tunnel by simply comparing the 
backup tunnel's destination address with the node-id included in the 
RRO of the primary tunnel.  
- Case 2: the backup tunnel terminates at an address different than the 
MP's node-id. Then a node-id subobject MUST also be included in the RRO 
object of the backup tunnel. A PLR can find the MP and suitable backup 
tunnel by simply comparing the node-ids present in the RRO objects of 
both the primary and backup tunnels.

draft-ietf-mpls-nodeid-subobject-06.txt                        May 2005 
 
 
 
When both IPv4 node-id and IPv6 node-id sub-objects are present, a PLR 
may use any or both of them in finding the MP address.  
 
4.     Security Considerations                              
 
This document does not introduce new security issues. The security 
considerations pertaining to [RSVP] and [RSVP-TE] remain relevant. 
 
5.     IANA considerations                                 
 
IANA will assign a new flag in the RRO object defined in [RSVP-TE]: 
 
Node-id flag: 0x20 (to be assigned by IANA). 
 
6.     Intellectual Property Considerations
