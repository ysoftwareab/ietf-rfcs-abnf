Internet-Draft       Media Type Registration for MXF          March 2006


1.  Introduction

   The present document registers a media type for SMPTE Material
   Exchange Format (MXF).  MXF, defined by SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M], is a
   standard wrapper format developed for the interchange of audiovisual
   material, including both audiovisual essence and rich metadata.

   Essence is the raw video, audio, and data streams contained and
   described by MXF.  Metadata carried by MXF includes structural
   metadata and descriptive metadata.  Structural metadata relates to
   the structure and capabilities of the MXF file, and is generally
   required for proper decoding.  Some examples of structural metadata
   are descriptions of essence types, information to help synchronize
   playout of audio and video, and content length.  Descriptive metadata
   gives information about the program content in the file, and is not
   essential for decoding.  Some examples of descriptive metadata are
   program title, actors, and scene descriptions.  The essence in MXF
   files may itself carry data, such as vertical blanking interval data
   used for carriage of Closed Captioning and other purposes.

   MXF is an important tool in providing interoperation between
   different video systems as well as digital cinema systems.  MXF also
   aids in the development of video production and distribution
   workflows that are more efficient, multi-vendor, file-based, and IT-
   oriented.

   SMPTE currently has standards for the mapping of the following
   essence types to the MXF generic container: MPEG (including MPEG-1
   and MPEG-2 video streams, as well as MPEG audio), DV-DIF (Digital
   Video Digital Interface Format for the DV family of related video
   encodings), Uncompressed Pictures, SDTI-CP (Serial Digital Transport
   Interface Content Package for delivering packetized audiovisual
   content over the SDI interface), D-10 (a specialized video stream
   incorporating MPEG-2 4:2:2P@ML), D-11 (a high-definition video
   compression standard), AES3 audio, Broadcast Wave audio, and A-Law
   audio.  The flexibility of the MXF generic container allows for the
   possibility of mappings of additional essence types in the future.

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify MXF files
   when they are served over HTTP or other network connections, included
   in multi-part documents, indexed by operating systems and digital
   asset management systems, or when used in other places where media
   types are used.


2.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for the application/mxf media type are

   discussed in the IANA media type registration (Section 3.1).


3.  IANA Considerations

   The present document requests that IANA registers the media type
   application/mxf as specified in Section 3.1.  The registration uses
   the template present in [RFC4288].

3.1.  Media Type for SMPTE Material Exchange Format (MXF)

      To: ietf-types@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of media type application/mxf

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: mxf

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: ULs

      The optional parameter ULs is a single Uniform Resource Name
      (URN), or a comma-separated list of multiple URNs of SMPTE
      Universal Labels (which are defined by SMPTE 400M [SMPTE400M]).

      This optional parameter provides hints to the decoder regarding
      the structure of the MXF file, which could include Operational
      Pattern, essence types, descriptive metadata schemes, and other
      elements that are identified by their SMPTE Universal Label.

      SMPTE Universal Labels are Object Identifiers (OIDs) as specified
      by [ASN1].  Thus a URN of a SMPTE Universal Label can use the OID
      URN namespace specified in [RFC3061], or any other future URN
      namespace that is appropriate for SMPTE Universal Labels.

      Note that, per [RFC2045], some characters (including the comma
      used to separate multiple values) require that the entire
      parameter value be enclosed in quotes.

      Below is an example of use of the optional parameter.  The two
      SMPTE Universal Labels indicate that the MXF file utilizes the
      OP1a Operational Pattern and contains IEC DV video at 25 Mbps, 525
      lines, 59.94 fps interlaced essence.

      Content-Type: application/mxf;
         ULs="urn:oid:1.3.52.4.1.1.1.13.1.2.1.1.1,
         urn:oid:1.3.52.4.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1"

      Encoding considerations: binary

      Security considerations: Application/mxf objects are not signed
      but may be partially encrypted internally.  External security
      mechanisms must be employed to ensure content confidentiality.
      MXF, through metadata extensions, may allow executable code to be
      transferred in the file.  It is suggested that no unauthenticated
      executables decoded from an MXF file be executed.  Some compressed
      essence types carried in MXF may carry a risk that certain
      pathological bitstreams could lead to potential denial-of-service
      attacks against these essence decoders.

      Interoperability considerations: MXF provides a standard wrapping
      for a number of audio and video essence types according to a
      number of different Operational Patterns (OP).  Thus
      interoperability depends upon the MXF file decoder having the
      capability to match the features of the MXF file encoder.  An
      Application Specification (AS) can ensure that MXF encoders and
      decoders can effectively interoperate.

      Published specification: RFC XXXX, SMPTE 377M [SMPTE377M]

      Applications which use this media type: MXF is a wrapper for many
      types of audio and video essence types in use by many applications
      in the broadcast and digital cinema industries.  These include
      non-linear editing systems, video servers, video camera systems,
      digital asset management systems, and digital video distribution
      systems.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): none

         File extension(s): .mxf

         Macintosh File Type Code(s): "mxf "
