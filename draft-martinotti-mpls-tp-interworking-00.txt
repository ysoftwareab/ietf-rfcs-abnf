1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   MPLS-TP is a joint ITU-IETF effort to include a MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS architecture to support the capabilities
   and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by
   ITU-T.  In the MPLS-TP requirements [draftjenkins] it is highlighted
   that an MPLS-TP architecture must allow interworking with new and
   already deployed IP/MPLS networks.

   ...

1.2.  Scope of this document

   This document illustrates the most likely interworking scenarios
   between MPLS-TP and IP/MPLS.  For each of the examined scenario
   interworking limitations, issues and open points, with particular
   focus on OAM capabilities, are provided.

   The main architectural construct considered in this document foresees
   PWE3 Protocol Stack Reference Model, however also MPLS Protocol Stack
   Reference Model is presented.  See [draftblb] for details.

4.  Problem Statement

   The problem this document is addressing is the network scenarios in
   which a MPLS-TP network can be interconnected with a IP/MPLS network
   in different ways, such that the network decomposition can envisage
   network layering and/or network partitioning.

   The presented scenarios are not intended to be comprehensive, for
   instance more complex scenarios can be created composing those
   presented in this document.


5.  Terminology

   As far as this document is concerned, the following terminology is
   used:

   o  MPLS-TP NE: a NE that supports MPLS-TP functions




Martinotti, et al.        Expires May 21, 2009                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  draft-martinotti-mpst-tp-interworking-00   November 2008


   o  MPLS-TP Network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed

   o  IP/MPLS NE: a NE that supports IP/MPLS functions

   o  IP/MPLS Network: a network in which IP/MPLS NEs are deployed

   For each of the scenarios described in this document, there are two
   paragraphs, one related to possible issues already envisaged by the
   authors (Open Issues), the other related to aspects still left for
   furthr study and/or definition (open Points).

   This Section provides some terminology about network layering and
   partitioning.  Primarily source of those definitions is [ITU-T
   G.805].  Readers already familiar with these concepts can skip this
   Section.

5.1.  Network Layering

   The following figure illustrates the Network Layering concept:


        ____     ___                                    ___     __

                          |    /           \__    |
                          |   /               \   |
                          +-0|                 |0-+
                              \               /
                               \   __   _    /
                                \_/  \_/ \__/
                                  Layer n-1


                             Network Layering

                                 Figure 1

   Layer n is carried over Layer n-1.  Some reader will also call this
   concept "Overlay model".

5.2.  Network Partitioning

   The following figure illustrates the Network Partitioning concept:


     ___     ___       ____                ____     ___       ___
   _/   \___/   \    _/    \__           _/    \___/   \    _/   \__

 /                              \  |   /                              \
|     Sub-Network Domain 1      |+++++|    Sub-Network Domain 2        |
 \                              /  |   \                              /
  \   __      ___     __      _/        \   ___      ___     __     _/
   \_/  \____/   \___/  \____/           \_/   \____/   \___/  \___/



                           Network Partitioning

                                 Figure 2

   The boundary between the two subnetworks can be a link (as defined by
   [ITU-T G.805]), but also a node, which in this case SHALL be able to
   handle the technologies of both subnetworks.

   The two subnetworks are at the same level.  Some reader will also
   call this concept "Peer model".


6.  Elements used in the figures

   A legenda of the symbols, which are most used in the following
   Sections, is provided, in order to facilitate compreension of the
   scenarios.

7.  Network Decomposition

   This Section provides some interworking scenarios, using the concepts
   described in Section 5.

7.1.  Network Layering

   In the rest of this Section the following roles applies:

   o  Customer network is carried over IP/MPLS (e.g. via PW
      encapsulation)

   o  IP/MPLS network is client of MPLS-TP subnetwork

   o  MPLS-TP subnetwork is deployed over Ethernet, other server layers
      are possible (not shown in this document)

7.1.1.  Ethernet encapsulation over MPLS-TP

   In this scenario the physical interface between the IP/MPLS and the
   MPLS-TP network is Ethernet; the interworking is done via Ethernet
   frame encapsulation in PW over MPLS-TP (as per PWE3 Protocol Stack
   Reference Model).

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks:

                  Ethernet encapsulation - Networks view

                                 Figure 4

   The LSR 3 and 7 are one hop away from the IP/MPLS layer point of
   view, thus there is no interaction between the control plane of IP/
   MPLS and MPLS-TP.

   The service provided by the MPLS-TP network is an E-Line service
   realized via VPWS, thus the LER4 and 6 are unaware that above the
   Ethernet layer there is a MPLS LSP.

   The following figure illustrates the stacking relationship among the
   technology layers and OAM relationship among the networks:

   Several levels of OAM are shown in the previous figure, these are not
   comprehensive (e.g.  Ethernet OAM defines several levels for each
   layer), any subset of them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief
   description of the different levels is provided:

      (9) End-to-End Client level OAM on Client network

      (8) Edge-to-Edge Client level OAM on IP/MPLS network

      (7) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at PW level)

      (6) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at LSP level)

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on MPLS-TP network (at PW level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on MPLS-TP network (at LSP level)

   Note that the OAM layers not directly related to MPLS-TP network have
   been reported just for completeness of the scenario, however their
   behaviour and interworking are out of scope of this document.

   Open Issues:

   o  None up to now

   Open Points:

   o  Inteworking between LSP OAM (2) and ETH OAM (3) and/or (4) is
      still to be cleared/defined

7.1.2.  IP/MPLS encapsulation over MPLS-TP

   In this scenario the physical interface between the IP/MPLS and the
   MPLS-TP network MAY be Ethernet; the interworking is done via client
   LSP encapsulation over MPLS-TP (as per MPLS Protocol Stack Reference
   Model).

   The following main features SHOULD be taken into account:

   o  Interaction at Data Plane

   o  Possible support of Management Plane of client MPLS Layer

   o  Possible support of Control Plane of client MPLS Layer

   o  Possible handling of PHP of client MPLS Layer

7.1.2.1.  IP/MPLS does not require PHP from MPLS-TP

   In this scenario the edge nodes of the MPLS-TP subnetwork are one hop
   away from no client node (of the IP/MPLS network) requiring PHP.

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks.

   which act as penultimate hop is required to drop LSP label of client
   IP/MPLS tunnel (indicated in direction from center to right on

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at PW level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on MPLS-TP network (at LSP level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kind)

   Open Issues:

   o  As in the IP/MPLS network the LSP, which is tunneled over MPLS-TP
      network, is terminated on an equipment requiring PHP (Equipment n.
      8), IP/MPLS OAM cannot be used at LSP level, so monitoring can be
      performed at PW level.  Interworking between MPLS-TP OAM and IP/
      MPLS on node 6 MAY be performed, but its deteils are out of scope
      of this document.

   Open Points:

   o  Inteworking between LSP OAM (2) and PW OAM (3) is still to be
      cleared/defined

7.2.  Network Partitioning

   In the rest of this Section the following roles applies:

   o  Customer network is carried partly over IP/MPLS subnetwork (e.g.
      via PW encapsulation) and partly over MPLS-TP subnetwork.

   For the purposes of this Section, MPLS-TP subnetwork is deployed
   between a CE and an IP/MPLS subnetwork.  Other kind of deployment are
   possible (not shown in this document), for instance:

   o  More than two subnetworks are deployed between the CEs

   o  MPLS-TP can be deployed between two subnetworks

7.2.1.  Border Equipment

   Main features to be taken into account:

   o  MultiSegment Pseudowire

   o  LSP Stitching

   o  Network Interworking

   o  End-to-End OAM support
