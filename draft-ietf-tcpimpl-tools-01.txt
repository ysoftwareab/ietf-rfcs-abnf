    1.	Status of this Memo

       This document is	an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are	working
       documents of the	Internet Engineering Task Force	(IETF),	its
       areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also
       distribute working documents as Internet	Drafts.

       Internet	Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
       months, and may be updated, replaced, or	obsoleted by other docu-
       ments at	any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet Drafts as
       reference material or to	cite them other	than as	``work in pro-
       gress''.

       To learn	the current status of any Internet Draft, please check

       bution of this memo is unlimited.



    2.	Introduction

       Available tools for testing TCP implementations are catalogued by
       this memo.  Hopefully disseminating this	information will
       encourage those responsible for building	and maintaining	TCP to
       make the	best use of available tests.  The type of testing the
       tool provides, the type of tests	it is capable of doing,	and its
       availability is enumerated.  This document lists	only tools which
       can evaluate one	or more	TCP implementations, and which can
       privde some specific results which describe or evaluate the TCP
       being tested.

    Category
       Performance / Stress


    Description
       Dbs is a	tool which allows multiple data	transfers to be	coordi-
       nated, and the resulting	TCP behavior to	be reviewed.  Results
       are presented as	ASCII log files.


    Automation
       Command of execution is driven by a script file.


    Availability
       See http://www.ai3.net/products/dbs for details of precise OS
       versions	supported, and for download of the source code.	 Current
       implementation supports BSDI BSD/OS, Linux, mkLinux, SunOS, IRIX,
       Ultrix, NEWS OS,	HP-UX.	Other environments are likely easy to
       add.


    Required Environment
       C language compiler, UNIX-style socket API support.



    3.2.  Dummynet

       Luigi Rizzo


    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       Dummynet	is a tool which	simulates the presence of finite size
       queues, bandwidth limitations, and communication	delays.	 Dum-
       mynet inserts between two layers	of the protocol	stack (in the
       current implementation between TCP and IP), simulating the above
       effects in an operational system.  This way experiments can be
       done using real protocol	implementations	and real applications,
       even running on the same	host (dummynet also intercepts communi-
       cations on the loopback interface).  Reconfiguration of dummynet
       parameters (delay, queue	size, bandwidth) can be	done on	the fly

       by using	a sysctl call.	The overhead of	dummynet is extremely
       low.


    Automation
       Requires	merging	diff files with	kernel source code.  Command-
       line driven through the sysctl command to modify	kernel vari-
       ables.

    3.4.  Orchestra


    Author
       Scott Dawson, Farnam Jahanian, and Todd Mitton


    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       This tool is a library which provides the user with an ability to
       build a protocol	layer capable of performing fault injection on
       protocols.  Several fault injection layers have been built using
       this library, one of which has been used	to test	different vendor
       implementations of TCP.	This is	accomplished by	probing	the ven-
       dor implementation from one machine containing a	protocol stack
       that has	been instrumented with Orchestra.  A connection	is
       opened from the vendor TCP implementation to the	machine	which
       has been	instrumented.  Faults may then be injected at the
       Orchestra side of the connection	and the	vendor TCP's response
       may be monitored.  The most recent version of Orchestra runs
       inside the X-kernel protocol stack on the OSF MK	operating sys-
       tem.

       When using Orchestra to test a protocol,	the fault injection
       layer is	placed below the target	protocol in the	protocol stack.
       This can	either be done on one machine on the network, if proto-
       col stacks on the other machines	cannot be modified (as in the
       case of testing TCP), or	can be done on all machines on the net-
       work (as	in the case of testing a protocol under	development).
       Once the	fault injection	layer is in the	protocol stack,	all mes-
       sages sent by and destined for the target protocol pass through



Parker,	Schmechel, Editors				[Page 5]

       it on their way to/from the network.  The Orchestra fault injec-
       tion layer can manipulate these messages.  In particular, it can
       drop, delay, re-order, duplicate, or modify messages.  It can
       also introduce new messages into	the system if desired.

       The actions of the Orchestra fault injection layer on each mes-
       sage are	determined by a	script,	written	in Tcl.	 This script is
       interpreted by the fault	injection layer	when the message enters
       the layer.  The script has access to the	header information about
       the message, and	can make decisions based on header values.  It
       can also	keep information about previous	messages, counters, or
       any other data which the	script writer deems useful.  Users of
       Orchestra may also define their own actions to be taken on mes-
       sages, written in C, that may be	called from the	fault injection
       scripts.


    Automation
       Scripts can be specified	either using a graphical user interface
       which generates Tcl, or by writing Tcl directly.	 At this time,
       post-analysis of	the results of the test	must also be performed
       by the user.  Essentially this consists of looking at a packet
       trace that Orchestra generates for (in)correct behavior.	 Must
       compile and link	fault generated	layer with the protocol	stack.

    Description
       An extensible Tcl/Tk based software toolset for protocol	develop-
       ment and	testing. Tcl (Tool Command Language) is	an embeddable
       scripting language and Tk is a graphical	user interface toolkit
       based on	Tcl.  The Packet Shell creates Tcl commands that allow
       you to create, modify, send, and	receive	packets	on networks.
       The operations for each protocol	are supplied by	a dynamic linked
       library called a	protocol library.  These libraries are silently
       linked in from a	special	directory when the Packet Shell	begins
       execution. The current protocol libraries are: IP, IPv6,	IPv6
       extensions, ICMP, ICMPv6, Ethernet layer, data layer, file layer
       (snoop and tcpdump support), socket layer, TCP, TLI.

       It includes harness, which is a Tk based	graphical user interface
       for creating test scripts within	the Packet Shell.  It includes
       tests for no initial slow start,	and retain out of sequence data
       as TCP test cases mentioned in Vern Paxson's first I-D [Pax97b].

       It includes tcpgraph, which is used with	a snoop	or tcpdump cap-
       ture file to produce a TCP time-sequence	plot using xplot.


    Automation
       Command-line driven through Tcl commands, or graphical user
       interface models	are available through the harness format.

    Required Environment
       Solaris 2.4 or higher.  Porting required	for other operating sys-
       tems.



    3.6.  Tcpanaly

    Category
       Functional Correctness /	Performance


    Description
       This is a tool for automatically	analyzing a TCP	implementation's
       behavior	by inspecting packet traces of the TCP's activity. It
       does so through packet filter traces produced by	tcpdump.  It has
       coded within it knowledge of a large number of TCP implementa-
       tions.  Using this, it can determine whether a given trace
       appears consistent with a given implementation, and, if so,
       exactly why the TCP chose to transmit each packet at the	time it
       did.  If	a trace	is found inconsistent with a TCP, tcpanaly
       either diagnoses	a likely measurement error present in the trace,
       or indicates exactly whether the	activity in the	trace deviates
       from that of the	TCP, which can greatly aid in determining how
       the traced implementation behaves.

       Tcpanaly's category is somewhat difficult to classify, since it
       attempts	to profile the behavior	of an implementation, rather
       than to explicitly test specific	correctness or performance
       issues.	However, this profile identifies correctness and perfor-
       mance problems.

       Adding new implementations of TCP behavior is possible with tcpa-
       naly through the	use of C++ classes.


    Automation
       Command-line driven and only the	traces of the TCP sending and
       receiving bulk data transfers are needed	as input.


    Availability

    Required Environment
       C++ compiler.

    Description
       This is a TCP trace file	analysis tool.	It reads output	trace
       files in	the formats of : tcpdump, snoop, etherpeek, and	netm.

       For each	connection, it keeps track of elapsed time,
       bytes/segments sent and received, retransmissions, round	trip
       times, window advertisements, throughput, etc from simple to very
       detailed	output.

       It can also produce three different types of graphs:

       Time Sequence Graph (shows the segments sent and	ACKs returned as
       a function of time)

       Instantaneous Throughput	(shows the instantaneous, averaged over
       a few segments, throughput of the connection as a function of
       time).

       Round Trip Times	(shows the round trip times for	the ACKs as a
       function	of time)


    Automation
       Command-line driven, and	uses the xplot program to view the
       graphs.


    Availability
       Source code is available, and Solaris binary along with sample
       traces.	See

INTERNET-DRAFT	Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors	   November 1997


    Description
       This is a TCP throughput	measurement tool based on sending UDP or
       ICMP packets in patterns	that are controlled at the user-level so
       that their timing reflects what would be	sent by	a TCP that
       observes	proper congestion control (and implements SACK).  This
       allows it to measure throughput independent of the TCP implemen-
       tation of end hosts and serve as	a useful platform for prototyp-
       ing TCP changes.


    Automation
       Command-line driven.  No	"server" is required, and it only
       requires	a single argument of the machine to run	the test to.

    4.	Summary
       This draft lists	all TCP	tests and testing tools	reported to the
       authors as part of TCP Implementer's working group and is not
       exhaustive.  These tools	have been verified as available	by the
       authors.



    5.	Security Considerations

       This version of this memo does not discuss any security-related
       issues though general packet manipulation and packet tracing can
       raise significant security issues.  These issues	may be covered
       in a later draft.
