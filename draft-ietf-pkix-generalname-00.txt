Abstract

   The PKIX working group has created the GeneralName [RFC2459] to support
   more name types than just the distinguished name specified by OSI.
   GeneralName is encoded in ASN.1.  When a GeneralName is communicated
   not using a ASN.1 encoded protocol (e.g., in a configuration file), there
   is a need to have a string representation of GeneralName.  This document
   specifies a string format for representing names, which is designed to give
   a clean representation of commonly used names, whilst being able to represent
   any GeneralName.  This specification also recognizes that GeneralName needs
   to be communicated to humans, in which case the encoding has to be user friendly
   for display purposes, for e.g. on a business card or in an email message.

   This is being published as a separate draft for convenience, but
   probably will be merged with RFC 2459 [RFC2459].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


1.  A notation for GeneralName


1.1  Goals

   The following goals are laid out:

    o  To provide an unambiguous representation of a GeneralName

    o  To be an intuitive format for the majority of GeneralNames

    o  To be fully general, and able to represent GeneralName with
       extension capability

    o  To give a clear representation of the contents of the
       GeneralName


1.2  Informal definition

   This notation is designed to be convenient for common forms of name.
   Some examples are given.  The author's directory distinguished name
   would be written:

                  directory:CN=Amit Kapoor, O=Trustpoint, C=US

   Or the author's mail name could be written as:

                  mail:ronald@trustpoint.com

   The IP address for a machine could be written as:

                  ip:192.168.0.10

   The basic structure is to provide the name type tag followed by
   the string representation of the name value.   


1.3  Formal definition

   A formal definition can now be given.  The structure is specified using
   the [ABNF] grammar:

     general-name = name-type ":" name-value
     name-type    = ALPHA *( ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" | "-" )
     name-value   = <any character>


   The name-type is case-insensitive.

   The list of valid name types and the corresponding name values
   with both application and display encodings are given below:


    GeneralName  Name-type       Name-value       Application   Display
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    RFC822       "mail"          addr-spec        [RFC822]      [RFC822]

    Directory    "directory"     name             [DN1]         [DN2]
 
    RegisteredId "registeredID"  oid              [DN1]         [DN1]

    DNSName      "dns"           hostname         [URI]         [URI]

    URI          "uri"           absoluteURI      [URI]         [IURI]

    X400Address  "x400"          O/R              [O/R]         [O/R]

    OtherName    "other"         other-value       <specified below>

    EDIPartyName "edi"           edi-value         <specified below>

    IPAddress    "ip"            (IPv4address     [IPV6]        [IPV6]
                                  | IPv6address)



     other-value      = <oid [DN1]> ":" <base64 encoded ANY value>

     edi-value        = [ name-assigner "," ] party-name
     name-assigner    = "assigner" ":" directory-string
     party-name       = "name" ":" directory-string
                         ; The "name" and "assigner" are case-insensitive

     directory-string = *(stringchar | pair) | 
                                 QUOTATION *(quotechar | pair) QUOTATION
     stringchar       = <any character except one of special, "\" or
                         QUOTATION >
     quotechar        = <any character except "\" or QUOTATION >
     pair             = "\" ( special | "\" | QUOTATION | hexpair )
     special          = ","
     hexpair          = hexchar hexchar

     hexchar          = DIGIT | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"
                              | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
     QUOTATION        = <ASCII double quotation mark character '"'>


   Elements of GeneralName not specified in this specification SHOULD
   be encoded in ASN.1 value notation form [X680].

   Application encoding MUST be used when communicating the name
   between applications, whereas Display encoding SHOULD be used
   for human readable purposes like business cards etc. The difference
   between the Application and Display encodings (if any) is that the
   Application encodings use a UTF-8 encoding step; this step is not
   desirable when intending a name for human consumption. Conversion
   between Display and Application encoding is an implementation detail
   and outside the scope of this specification.


2.  Examples

   This section gives a few examples of GeneralName's written
   using this notation:

   1. Distinguished Name

     display encoding:

        directory:CN=Ronald Tschal„r, O=Trustpoint, C=US

     application encoding:

        directory:CN=Ronald Tschal\C3\A4r, O=Trustpoint, C=US

   2. RFC822Mail Name

     mail:amit@trustpoint.com

   3. URI

     uri:http://www.trustpoint.com/

   4. DNS

     dns:gandalf.trustpoint.com

   5. IP Address

     ip:191.162.20.10

   6. Registered

     registeredID:1.22.3456.4.58.60
