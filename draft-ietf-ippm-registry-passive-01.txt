                Passive Performance Metrics Sub-Registry
                draft-ietf-ippm-registry-passive-01.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry
   of the Performance Metric Registry.  This sub-registry contains
   Passive Performance Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs
   prepared in the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the
   IETF, and possibly applicable to other IETF metrics.

   This document specifies a way to organize registry entries into
   columns that are well-defined, permitting consistent development of
   entries over time (a column may be marked NA if it is not applicable
   for that metric).  The design is intended to foster development of
   registry entries based on existing reference RFCs, whilst each column
   serves as a check-list item to avoid omissions during the
   registration process.  Every entry in the registry, before IANA
   action, requires Expert review as defined by concurrent IETF work in
   progress "Registry for Performance Metrics" (draft-ietf-ippm-metric-
   registry).

   The document contains example entries for the Passive Performance
   Metrics sub-registry: a registry entry for a passive metric based on
   octetTotalCount as defined in RFC5102 and a protocol specific passive
   metric based on RTP packets lost as defined in RFC3550.  The examples
   are for Informational purposes and do not create any entry in the
   IANA registry.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   The IETF has been specifying and continues to specify Performance
   Metrics.  While IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) is the working group
   (WG) primarily focusing on Performance Metrics definition at the
   IETF, other working groups, have also specified Performance Metrics:

      The "Metric Blocks for use with RTCP's Extended Report Framework"
      [XRBLOCK] WG recently specified many Performance Metrics related
      to "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)" [RFC3611],
      which establishes a framework to allow new information to be
      conveyed in RTCP, supplementing the original report blocks defined
      in "RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications",
      [RFC3550].

      The Benchmarking Methodology" [BMWG] WG proposed some Performance
      Metrics as part of the benchmarking methodology.

      The IP Flow Information eXport WG (IPFIX) [IPFIX] has existing and
      proposed Information Elements related to performance metrics.

      The Performance Metrics for Other Layers (PMOL) [PMOL], a
      concluded working group, defined some Performance Metrics related
      to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) voice quality [RFC6035], as
      well as guidelines for defining performance metrics [RFC6390]

   It is expected that more and more Performance Metrics will be defined
   in the future, not only IP based metrics, but also protocol-specific
   ones and application-specific ones.

   "Registry for Performance Metrics" [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry]
   specifies a common registry for Performance Metrics.  This document
   specifies the creation of a sub-registry specific to Performance
   Metrics metered by an Passive Measurement Method (passive metrics).
   Note that a sister document, "Active Performance Metric Sub-Registry"

Internet-Draft            Passive Sub-Registry                 July 2014


   [I-D.ietf-ippm-registry-active], specifies a sub-registry for the
   active metric (Performance Metrics metered by an Active Measurement.

   The Passive Performance Measurements Sub-Registry contains passive
   performance metrics that meet the criteria set by the IETF and review
   of the Performance Metric Experts.  It is expected that the majority
   of the metrics will have been defined elsewhere within the IETF
   working groups such as IPPM, BMWG, IPFIX, etc.

   This sub-registry is part of the Performance Metric Registry
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] which specifies that all sub-
   registries must contain at least the following common fields: the
   identifier, the name, the URI, the status, the requester, the
   revision, the revision date, the description, and the reference
   specification(s).  In addition to these common fields the passive
   metrics sub-registry has additional fields that provide the necessary
   background for interoperability and adoption.

3.  Terminology

   "Registry for Performance Metrics" [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry]
   specifies the following terms: Performance Metric, Registered
   Performance Metric, Performance Metrics Registry (also known as
   Registry), Proprietary Registry, Performance Metrics Experts,
   Performance Metrics Directorate, Parameter, Active Measurement
   Method, Passive Measurement Method, and Hybrid Measurement Method.

   Capitalized terms used in this document that are defined in the
   Terminology section of [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] are to be
   interpreted as defined there.

4.  Background and Motivation

   EDITOR's NOTE: from draft-manyfolks-ippm-metric-registry-00.
   Proposal: we can simply refers to draft-ietf-ippm-registry-active-00
   section 5, instead of duplicating text.

   IPPM Passive Performance Metric registration is meant to allow wider
   adoption of common metrics in an inter-operable way.  There are
   challenges with metric interoperability and adoption (to name a few)
   due to flexible input parameters, confusion between many similar
   metrics, and varying output formats.

   One clear motivation for having such a registry is to allow a
   controller to request a measurement agent to perform a measurement
   using a specific metric (see [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework]).  Such a
   request can be performed using any control protocol that refers to
   the value assigned to the specific metric in the registry.

Internet-Draft            Passive Sub-Registry                 July 2014


   Similarly, the measurement agent can report the results of the
   measurement and by referring to the metric value it can unequivocally
   identify the metric that the results correspond to.

   There are several side benefits of having a registry with well-chosen
   entries.  First, the registry could serve as an inventory of useful
   and used metrics that are normally supported by different
   implementations of measurement agents.  Second, the results of the
   metrics would be comparable even if they are performed by different
   implementations and in different networks, as the metric and method
   is unambiguously defined.

5.  Scope

   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] defines the overall structure for a
   Performance Metric Registry and provides guidance for defining a sub
   registry.

   This document defines the Passive Performance Metrics Sub-registry;
   passive metrics are those where the measurements are based the
   observation of on network traffic, generated either from the end
   users or from network elements.  Specifically, this traffic has not
   been generated for the purpose of measurement.

   A row in the registry corresponds to one Registered Performance
   Metric, with entries in the various columns specifying the metric.
   Section 6 defines the additional columns for a Registered Passive
   Performance Metric.

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry], each entry (row)
   must be tightly defined; the definition must leave open only a few
   parameters that do not change the fundamental nature of the
   measurement (such as source and destination addresses), and so
   promotes comparable results across independent implementations.
   Also, each registered entry must be based on existing reference RFCs
   (or other standards) for performance metrics, and must be
   operationally useful and have significant industry interest.  This is
   ensured by expert review for every entry before IANA action.

6.  Passive Registry Categories and Columns

   This section defines the categories and columns of the registry.
   Below, categories are described at the 6.x heading level, and columns
   are at the 6.x.y heading level.  There are three categories, divided
   into common information (from [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry]),
   metric definition and an open Comments section.

6.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt all necessary details
   related to the passive performance metric definition, including the
   RFC reference and values of input factors, called fixed parameters,
   which are left open in the origin definition but have a particular
   value defined by the performance metric.

6.2.1.  Reference Definition

   This entry provides references to relevant sections of the RFC(s)
   defining the metric, as well as any supplemental information needed
   to ensure an unambiguous definition for implementations.

6.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors whose value must be specified in
   the Registry.  The measurement system uses these values.

   Where referenced metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Fixed Parameters.  For example, for RTP packet loss calculation
   relies on the validation of a packet as RTP which is a multi-packet
   validation controlled by MIN_SEQUENTIAL as defined by [RFC3550].
   Varying MIN_SEQUENTIAL values can alter the loss report and this
   value could be set as a fixed parameter.

   A Parameter which is Fixed for one Registry entry may be designated
   as a Run-time Parameter for another Registry entry.

6.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous method for implementations.

6.3.1.  Reference Implementation

   This entry provides references to relevant sections of the RFC(s)
   describing the method of measurement, as well as any supplemental
   information needed to ensure unambiguous interpretation for
   implementations referring to the RFC text.

   Specifically, this section should include pointers to pseudocode or
   actual code that could be used for an unambigious implementation.

6.3.2.  Traffic Filter Criteria

   The filter specifies the traffic constraints that the passive
   measurement method used is valid (or invalid) for.  This includes
   valid packet sampling ranges, width of valid traffic matches (eg. all
   traffic on interface, UDP packets packets in a flow (eg. same RTP
   session).

   It is possible that the measurement method may not have a specific
   limitation.  However, this specific registry entry with it's
   combination of fixed parameters implies restrictions.  These
   restrictions would be listed in this field.

6.3.3.  Measurement Timing

   Measurement timing defines the behavior of the measurement method
   with respect to timing.

      Is the measurement continuous?

      If the measurement is sampled, what is the format of sampling? (eg
      random packet, random time, etc.)

      How long is the measurement interval?

6.3.4.  Output Type(s) and Data Format

   For entries which involve a stream and many singleton measurements, a
   statistic may be specified in this column to summarize the results to
   a single value.  If the complete set of measured singletons is
   output, this will be specified here.

   Some metrics embed one specific statistic in the reference metric
   definition, while others allow several output types or statistics.

   Each entry in the output type column contains the following
   information:

   o  Value: The name of the output type

   o  Data Format: provided to simplify the communication with
      collection systems and implementation of measurement devices.

   o  Reference: the specification where the output type is defined

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.
   It can be the raw result(s) or it can be some form of statistic.  The
   specification of the output type must define the format of the

Internet-Draft            Passive Sub-Registry                 July 2014


   output.  In some systems, format specifications will simplify both
   measurement implementation and collection/storage tasks.  Note that
   if two different statistics are required from a single measurement
   (for example, both "Xth percentile mean" and "Raw"), then a new
   output type must be defined ("Xth percentile mean AND Raw").

6.3.5.  Metric Units

   The measured results must be expressed using some standard dimension
   or units of measure.  This column provides the units.

   When a sample of singletons (see [RFC2330] for definitions of these
   terms) is collected, this entry will specify the units for each
   measured value.

6.3.6.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Run-Time Parameters.

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   Examples of Run-time Parameters include IP addresses, measurement
   point designations, start times and end times for measurement, and
   other information essential to the method of measurement.

6.4.  Comments and Remarks

   Besides providing additional details which do not appear in other
   categories, this open Category (single column) allows for unforeseen
   issues to be addressed by simply updating this Informational entry.
