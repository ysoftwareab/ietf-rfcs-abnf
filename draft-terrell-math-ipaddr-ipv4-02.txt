Abstract

This paper was necessitated by an overwhelming desire. An attempt to
end the disparity in the dissemination of information which is absent
of the logical and thoroughness in rendering an explanation of the IP
Addressing Scheme. To render a more pointed fact, I needed to pass a
CISCO Certification Examination. However, this can never be
accomplished, if the information that is needed and used in the
preparation thereof, lacks continuity and propagates errors pertaining
to foundational information. That is,as a direct result of this
undertaking, I corrected  the underlining errors, derived a possible
alternative approach to the IPv4 Addressing Scheme, and expanded its
Class system ( that is no longer in use ). In other words, I was
indeed successful in the elimination of the problems associated with
IP Address Flooding inherent in IPv4 and the complexities of IPv6.
In short, small business and single family dwellings can now have the
option of having their own private IP Addressing Scheme, without the
disparity resulting from the steep learning curve presented in IPv6.
While the Internet Community at large, will not suffer a shortage of
the availability IP Addresses for assigned distribution. Especially
since, while the number available IP Addresses do not exceed the
amount reported to be provided, if IPv6 is implemented. It does
indeed, provide enough IP Addresses to cover their continued issuance
for at least another 100 years or so. Which is dependent upon the
adoption of an adequate scheme for its allocation and distribution.



Introduction

The DARPA mission was quite clear from its inception. However, the
demand for simplification and ease of implementation promoted the
need for a further ' break down ' of the Addressing Scheme regarding
IPv4 configuration. Needless to say, while this simplicity in its
ease of use and implementation will be lost with the establishment
of the next generation, IPv6. It is nonetheless, the objective of
this paper to rekindle an interest for a further exploitation of
IPv4 prior to any implementation of IPv6. Nevertheless, the
current Classification of the IPv4 Addressing Scheme yields;

1. Class A: 1 - 126, with 24 Bit Host count ; Where 0 ( Zero ) and
   127 reserved   unknown Network and loopback

2. Class B: 128 - 191, with 16 Bit Host count

3. Class C: 192 - 223, with 8 Bit Host count

4. Class D: 224 - 239 ; Used for Multicasting, Host count not
   applicable

5. Class E: 240 - 254 ; Denoting Experimental, Host counts not
   applicable

Note: There is no Division of Classes D or E, in fact they are not
      capable of being Subnetted.

The problem however, is that, throughout every explanation ( read thus
far ) of this IPv4 Addressing Scheme. It is a given that, the Network
Address is determined by the ( or Should be determined by ) First
Octet in the Address Scheme. However, this method is reserved for
the Class A. In other words, if the Addressing Scheme ( or Pattern )
that resolves the Class A, were used to determine the number of
Networks and Hosts within all Classes of IPv4 Addressing Scheme.
Then, one would find that the number of Networks and their associated
Hosts, which could be associated with every Class other than Class
A, would increase. Especially if the Subnet were defined and employed
as an additional Identifier, not only of the number of Networks, but
the number of Hosts as well. Nonetheless, the logical discrepancy
within the Mathematical Calculation of the present IPv4 Addressing
Scheme shall become even more apparent. Especially when one is
required to determine the number of Networks that would result from
the determination of the Address Range for each Subnet of a given
Network Address. That is, if one were to continue to employ the
current methods as outlined and defined for the IPv4 Addressing
Scheme, then they would also discover the difference between the
mathematical calculation of  the Decimal and Binary numbers
associated with the IP Addresses.

Nevertheless, it is from the discovery of these minor discrepancies
and their solution, which prompted the need for this Internet Draft.

Please note: Only IP Addressing and its related Mathematical
             Calculations, shall be discussed here. All other quires
             inherent to IP Addressing and Messaging should be sought
             within the Subject Matter of their respective RFC's.

Chapter I  'The 32 Bit Structure and the Layout of the 4 Octets'

We currently utilize the 32 Bit, 4 Octet Rule as the instrument of
choice in the IPv4 Addressing Scheme. Furthermore, while the Class
System has been eliminated for the current IP Addressing Scheme. I
will, because of my continued belief in its importance, and the
significance of the resulting information,  begin with an overview
of the IP Class Addressing Scheme.

Nevertheless, there are two additional points that warrant mention
in this deliberation:

1. The Octet Rule

2. The Laws of Ones and Zeros in the IP Address format.

Let's examine number 2 first. Where the Laws of IP Addressing States:

1. The Network Address portion of an IP address cannot be Set to
   either all Binary Ones or All Binary Zeros

2. The Subnet portion of an IP address cannot be Set to either All
   Binary Ones or All Binary Zeros

3. The Host portion of an IP address cannot be Set to All
   Binary Ones or All Binary Zeros

4. The IP address 127.x.x.x can never be assigned as a Network Address

Asides from noting the fact that, these Laws govern only Binary
representation ( with the exception of number 4, of course ). It
should be quite clear that there is a marked difference between the
results and the mathematical calculation of decimal and binary
numbers. Nonetheless, from the analysis of number one above, one
observes that if it is violated in either case. Then the violations
would interfere with the predefined assignment of All Binary Ones;
being the Broadcast Address. Or if the IP address were All Zeros,
then it would interfere with the predefined IP address indicating
that the Network in question has an Unknown Address. Nevertheless,
with the defining premise or argument of the basic IP Address of
All Binary Ones being given as the Broadcast Address. Then it stands
to reason that; for every IP Address prefixed with the Address of a
Host followed by Octets of Binary Ones. This would also be a
Broadcast Address, whose broadcasts would be directed to, and defined
by the Octets preceding those containing All Binary Ones. Where any
IP Address of a Subnet whose remaining Octets contain All Binary
Ones, then this would be a Broadcast Address for every Subnet
maintaining this Address. Needless to say, this same line of
reasoning can be applied to Host Addressing as well. However, while
the definition for an IP Address containing All Binary Zeros is well
established, its logical reasoning does not map as easily as that
containing the Binary of All Ones. Nevertheless, for every IP Address
of any Host, whose remaining Octets are All Binary Zeros, then the
IP Address resolves to the Host Address as defined by the Octets
preceding the Octets having All Binary Zeros assigned. In other
words, if the remaining Octets in a Subnet IP Address are All Binary
Zeros, then this Address location is defined as being Address for
the Subnet in question. This rules applies for the Host Address as
well, except that the IP Address would be the location of the Host
having this IP Address assignment.

The OCTET Rule, while less cumbersome to explain, has presented a
difference, because its definition concerns two different systems
of Counting: Decimal and Binary. Nevertheless, IPv4 IP Addressing
Scheme is a 32 Bit implementation containing 4 sections for its
addressing space. However, for ease of translation for electronic
communication, each of these address spaces has 8 Binary numerical
representations. That can only maintain either one of two states,
which is represented as either a 1 or a 0. However, these Binary
digits, collectively called an OCTET, that represent a Binary Number,
can also be translated into Integer. The mathematical numeration more
easily understood by every casual person, and known as the Counting
Numbers. Needless to say, it is the Translation or Numerical
conversion of these different Systems of Enumeration where the
Equivalency between them, begins and ends. In other words, Binary
is not equal in any way to Decimal, and any translation a variable
pertaining to one or the other, requires another mathematical
operation for this equivalency to be realize. Given by the example
Equations:

                     1. xxxxxxx    /=    yyyyyyy


                     2. ( xxxxxxx ) * v   =   ( yyyyyyy )

     { Where /= means "NOT EQUAL TO", and " x " is Binary, " y " is
       Decimal. The ' * ' is used to denote the operation of
       multiplication, and 'v' represents some Mathematical
       Expression used to Translate the Banary to its Decimal
       equivalent. }

In words, the Octet Rule states: " There must exist 8 Bits for every
Byte of Address Space used in an IP Address Format, and this Address
Space is called an Octet. " However, while the method, specification,
and procedures for the Internet Protocol is defined in RFC 791. Which
defines the boundary of the Address Space as being from ' 0 - 255 ',
in a 32 Bit logical Address Format. It can be proven mathematically
that the Octet Rule is indeed valid, even if the size of the Logical
Address Format changes. In other words, under the IPv4 system there
is 4 Octets in the Logical Address Format, which renders a 32 Bit
Address Format. While the IPv6 system provides a 128 Bit Address
Format, and there is a marked difference in their structures. Where
by, the former maintains a two tier system, while the latter is 3
tier system comprising HEX notation. Nonetheless, neither system
violates the Octet Rule, which is more clearly understood when the
former explanation used with the pictorial given by Figure A.

Chapter II  'Subnetting the Past, its future a boon for Squeezing Out
             more IP's'

The Subnetting features of IPv4 did not offer much through options and
choice regarding IP Address assignment, allocation, or Networking in
general. And while Subnetting the Network ( The sub-division of the
Parent Network IP Address ) did relieve congestion, provided
performance gains, and improved management. Needless to say, these
were indeed significant benefits for the groping beginnings. Still,
it did nothing to increase the number of IP Addresses for allocation
to establish a new Network, that is, offer another outside connection:
the Parent Network. However, it did provide the IETF with a foundation,
if exploited, would have avoided the necessity of an urgency fostered
by explosive growth, to implement a new IP Addressing Scheme.

Nevertheless, by exploiting the Default Subnet Mask, that is,
understanding its real purpose as used in BITWISE ANDING. That being,
IP Network Address Resolution, Octet by Octet. Then anyone could
easily visualize that, the former IPv4 Class Addressing Scheme, as
depicted in Appendix I, Table 6, could be expanded to that rendered
in Table 4. Where the Default Subnet Mask, now the Subnet Identifier,
assumes the duties of its actual definition. That is, it remains the
Default Subnet Mask, which when used in Bitwise Anding serves to
resolve the Parent Network IP Address. This working definition itself,
commands the expansion and the results as depicted in Table 4. In
other words, the Default Subnet Mask, is indeed a Subnet, and it is
also an Identifier of the Parent Network.

It should be understood, that the explosive growth of the Internet
and Internetworking environments fostered a serious burden upon the
IETF, as well as every other IT Professional. Notwithstanding the
hurried imposition of market demands, the voice of the consumer,
and the shortage of the insightful. It is easy to understand why the
nearly Doubled Number of Available IP Addresses, from an expansion of
this 32 Bit Addressing Scheme was over looked. In other words, the
original IPv4 Class Addressing Scheme yield the possible number of
available IP Addresses as being approximately 3.12 * 10^9. While
the expansion given be Table 4, renders the number of available IP
Addresses as being approximately 5.46 * 10^9. Which, to say the very
least, is nearly double the original value, while the Address Range
remained Constant; i.e. 32 Bits. Now, just consider what could be
achieved if the Address Bit Range was increased to 128 Bit, which
is the case for IPv6. It is worthy of note, to mention that, while
IPv6 has a reported address range of approximately Y.YY * 10^39 at
an 128 Bit Address Space. Well- Only a test of Class A-1, of IPv4
was performed. Nonetheless, the value of the number of available
IP Addresses in IPv4 was approximately Y.YY * 10^22, however this
was only a 64 Bit Address Space.

Moreover, the great benefit of this analysis is that, IPv4 was shown
to have a life, retained its simplicity, and would prove to be cost
effective if its expansion were implemented. Furthermore, from
Figure 1, it can be easily seen that, tools can be created to assist
the professional, that is, if IPv4 were implemented as either a 64 or
128 Bit IP Address Range, that would facilitate IP resolution, and
expedite IP deployment in any Network.

Chapter III  'Addressing the Future, taking notes on the IP's past'

The IP Addressing Scheme of IPv4 served, some actually thought, the
limits of its rational purpose. It was indeed successful in meeting
the challenges of the growing Internetworking community. However, it
has been shown and proven that, it limits may not possess a boundary.
Nevertheless, while there exist the possibility of expanding the
number of Bits of any IP Addressing Scheme either previously or
currently employed. At this junction, one would perhaps question the
aggression of this endeavor. In other words, prior to any major
change, it now seem more rational to consider directing ones thoughts
towards the simple idea of exploitation that which is already in
place.

Just imagine for a moment, the cost of implementing another more
radical, or different IP Addressing Scheme. 'If it ain't broke, don't
fix it! ' Clearly, this phrase has no application here, because, even
with backward compatibility were employed. Would that suffice? Would
it allow the millions of software applications, or hardware for that
matter, and the purchaser's to run their course of time through its
normal use and associated life expectancy? Or is this some sort proof, t
hat we have not learned to fully use and exploit our available
resources? Nonetheless, one of the most obvious implications of
the exploitation of IPv4 was that an Addressing beyond the 32 Bit now
employed is not necessary. Furthermore, the analogy of the Telephone
Area Codes, renders an excellent example of measures that might be
employed to separate the current IPv4 Addressing Scheme so that every
country could used the same scheme, differing only by the Code of the
Country that uses it. While clearly, the Class System has been
erroneously blamed, guilty of providing too many IP Addresses because
the Classes were too large in size. However, this class system
provided a greater structure to the IP Addressing System, one that I
fear, will be lost when IPv6 is employed.

Chapter IV  'The Questions Raised: Is there Tenure for a Better
             Allocation Plan?'

When entertaining the thoughts of a tenure, I think of Einstein and
Newton, whose works will never be forgotten, and will forever retain a
significance in natural science and mathematics. Even when reading the
works dealing with Internetworking, I noticed the popular catch
phrases of its underlining philosophy: ' Careful Planning ' ,
' Attention to Detail ', ' Thorough Analysis 'or ' Planned Expansion'.
In other words, it is possible to plan or devise an IP Address
Allocation Scheme , with the appropriate IP Address System, that will
not have a tenure. Because, the right IP Addressing System, with an
accompanying Allocation Scheme could possibly last forever, and never
would be an exhaustion of the available IP Addresses. In other words,
the foundation has been provided, all that is needed now are the
careful collective thoughts for its use and implementation.

Chapter V Conclusion; 'An Alternate View of the IPv4 Addressing
                       Scheme would prove Beneficial now!'

Nevertheless, if we allowed the Pre-Defined ' Class Address Range ',
remain as the standard classification for the division of the IPv4
Addressing Scheme Classes, and redefined the application / used of the
Default Subnet  as the Subnet Identifier. We could effectively extend
the amount of Addresses available for use under our current system.
Where by, we could  increase the number of addresses available in the
current system ( IPv4 ) while retaining the simplicity of its ease of
use and implementation. As has been clearly shown.

Needless to say, this can be organized as:

                        Table 1.

Note: The Equation for Determining the IP Address Range for
      any IP Class is; (REN - RBN) + 1 =
      Total of Available IP Addresses for the given Class.
      (Where, R = Range, E = End, B = Beginning, N = Number)

Special Note: 255.255.255.255 remains' a Broadcast IP, 127.x.x.x
              remains LoopBack IP, and 0.0.0.0 remains Network
              Unknown. This renders the Range of possible Hosts to
              the Value of the given range; 1 - 254. However, with
              the implementation of this minor change to the Class
              Addressing Scheme, not only can Class D and E be given
              their respective Multicast and Experimental IP
              Addresses. But, with this new division, even smaller
              Companies or perhaps private homes can now have their
              individual IP Addresses without the problems associated
              with IP Address Flooding, which plagued the former
              Addressing Scheme. Moreover, this minor change does
              not usher the complexities or sharpen the learn curve,
              as does IPv6. And while it does not provide a greater
              number of available IP Addresses for allocation to
              public and private sectors, there is a definite
              increase of available IP Addresses.


Nevertheless, from the above representation ( table 1 ) it can seen
that the calculations for the total number of Hosts ( that is the
combined number of Networks and Hosts, from each class ) is similar
to the layout of IPv4. And while the learning curve still exists,
the difficulties would be miniscule when compared to that of learning
Ipv6, at least for those acquainted with IP Addressing.

Needless to say, a comparison between the entries of Table 1, when
utilizing Figure 1 ( taking the " ** " of the first IP Slide Ruler
as our reference point ), that renders a clear and concise view of
the ease of use and possible implementation of this minor change in
the IPv4 Addressing Scheme. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized, that
the authoritative community as a whole; i.e. Authors of IP Addressing
or Internetworking Fundamentals, have shown a lack of continuity and
consistency regarding the actual methods, determination and or actual
explanation of the processes involved in these calculations. Where by,
it has been a consistent error regarding the confusion or inability
to differentiate between the calculation of the Decimal Number and
the Binary Number for their individual determination. Which, to say
the very least, has rendered the understanding of the most
significant part of the concept of Internetworking ( that of IP
Addressing ) almost an impossible undertaking. However, this is not,
nor is it intended to be, a verbal lashing of the Computer Science
Community. Needless to say, through the use of the IP Slide Rules,
one can easily see the difference between the numeral values of the
Decimal and Binary calculations, including their results.

Nevertheless, to continue with the analysis and the comparison. It
should now become easy to determine the number of Networks and Hosts
for a given Network Address. For example, if anyone needed to know
the number of Hosts for a given Class, they need only to observe the
First Octet of the Network Address and its Subnet Identifier.
Especially since, it has been established that there is a distinct
difference between the calculation of the Decimal and the Binary
notations. Where by, the clarity of the latter is given by Table II
when compared with that of Table1.

      is the 'Quantified difference between the IP Address Range
      Plus 1', for each respective Class Boundary's.
      [(REN - RBN) + 1)] Moreover, the Subnet Identifier, 255, has
      a Binary Representation of; 11111111.

>From the above however, it can be clearly seen that the Total Number
of Hosts resulting from this 32 Bit Expansion achieves approximately
5.xx * 10^9. However, it does, at least make provisions for
individualized IP Addressing assignments. Nevertheless, it is far
less than the reported X.xx * 10^39 number of Hosts promised by the
implementation of IPv6. The conclusions of the former notwithstanding,
however, it should be pointed out. That a 64 or more Bit Expansion of
the current IPv4 Addressing Scheme would more closely approach, and
possibly exceed, not only the Number of Hosts, as is the promise of
IPv6. But, would retain its overall simplicity, in its implementation
and ease of use.

Furthermore, this particular Addressing Scheme follows, as can be
argued, directly from Logic of the Binary Representation and its
inherent methods of Mathematical Reasoning. Where by, the clarity and
support of this argument is given by Table 3.

Note: The Ternary Section of every Network Class need not be
      Sub-Divided, and could be combined for the issuance of
      Individual IP Addresses.

Nevertheless, the question of ponderence, is whether or not this is
the perfect IP Addressing System. That is, does it have a tenure or
life expectancy? I would assume that almost everyone would answer
these questions with a no.

In fact, an issue, while not a major problem, does indeed exist with
the current expansion of IPv4 Class Addressing Scheme, as depicted in
Table 1. Where by, the Mathematics Analysis reveals that the Second
Octet of the Primary Section of Each Class maintains a Set of Values
within each of their respective IP Address Ranges. Which can not be
employed or used as part of the count resulting in the total number
of available IP Addresses. This is because they are not available as
a valid IP Address, and if they were, then there would exist a
mathematical conflict with the calculation of the total number of
available IP Addresses of the Secondary Section for each IP Address
Class. In other words, there would arise an error in reporting the
results of the calculated totals. This can easily visualized when
compared with the results of the second Octet of the Secondary
Section for each of the IPv4 Class Address Ranges. That is, there
exist a barrier imposed by the use of the Subnet Identifier of the
second Octet from the Secondary Section of each IPv4 Class Address
Schemes, with bars the use of any of the numbers given by the IP
Address Range for that given IP Address Class. This is seen true,
because the 1 - 254 total Host Count, does indeed contain all of the
numbers available to be used as IP Addresses. However, this does
cripple the IPv4 Class Addressing System. Where by, the calculation
of the mathematical difference between IP Address Range for each Class
and the total Host count would yield the valid Address Range that can
be use to calculate that total number of  available IP Addresses.
Nonetheless, while using the pictorial of Figure A, this is given by
the following Table of Laws / Rules:

              { The IPV4 The Laws of the Octet }

1. By definition, there exist 3 distinct Sections or Divisions for
   every IP Address Class. However, the number of Sections or
   Divisions is dependent upon IP Bit Address Range defined for the
   IP Address.

2. The Sections or Divisions of the IP Address Class are defined as:
   Primary, Secondary, Ternary, etc...And are labeled according to
   their respective Class Location (e.g.: Class A would be Class A-1,
   Class A-2, Class A-3, and continued as would be necessary to
   distinguish the remaining Classes, B - E.)

3. The Subnet Identifier assigns to any Octet in which it defines,
   within any Section or Division of every IP Class, when not use as
   the Default Subnet Mask, only the value of the numbers available
   in the IP Address Range assigned to that IP Class.

4. For every OCTET within any Section or Division of any IP Class,
   which is not defined by the Subnet Identifier, can be assigned
   any value in the range of 1 - 254. That is, provided that there
   is no succeeding Section or Division, or the OCTET of the
   succeeding Section or Division, whose reference is the same Octet,
   is not defined by the Subnet Identifier.

5. For every OCTET within any Section or Division of any IP Class,
   that is defined by the Subnet Identifier and is preceded by a
   Section or Division whose reference is the same Octet. Where the
   case is such that: The Octet of the preceding Section or Division
   is not defined by the Subnet Identifier. Then, the Octet of the
   preceding Section or Division can not be assigned any value as
   given by the IP Address Range assigned to that IP Class.

Needless to say, this situation can be further explored, through
mathematical calculations. Where the given example in this case would
be Class A-1 and Class A-2.

1.Class A-1, 1 - 126, Subnet Identifier 255.000.000.000:
                    126 Networks and 254^3 Hosts: 0

2.Class A-2, 1- 126, Subnet Identifier 255.255.000.000:
                     126^2 Networks and 254^2 Hosts: 10

Nevertheless, upon examination of these classes, it is quite obvious
that if Class A-1's second Octet were to maintain the IP Address
Range from 1 - 126, then it would be reporting IP Address of Class
A-2 because the second Octet of this Class is defined by the Subnet
Identifier. However, the easiest mathematical method for the
determination of the total number of available IP Addresses from Class
A-1 would be to calculate the total number of IP Addresses available
from its original configuration. Then subtract the value as would be
determined from the calculation of the Class A-1 IP Address
configuration that can not be used. In which case, we have:

3. Class A-1, 1 - 126, Subnet Identifier 255.126.000.000: 126 Networks
                       and 254^2 Hosts    0

   (Which in Reality is actually the Subnet Address of a Subnetted
    Network IP Address Range: Subnet 255.126.000.000: 126 Networks
    and 254^2 Hosts: 0 )

                           or

4.   126 * (254)^2 = 8,129,016

Where the total, would be that given by Table 1., as being:

5.   126 * (254)^3 = 2,064,770,064

In other words, the total number of available IP Addresses in
Class A-1, that could be assigned as a Parent Network IP Address for
connection to the Internetwork ( That is, other than the in house
Network ), would be the difference between these equations. As given
by:

6.   2,064,770,064 - 8,128,016 = 2,056,641,048

This method is demonstrated and render by Table 4. Where the results
of equation 6 equals the total number of IP Addresses available for
assignment as a Parent Network in an Internetworking Environment, and
the results of equation 4 yield the number of Hosts that can be
repeatedly assigned and used as private Domain Network IP Addresses.
In which case, one would need to access the Parent Network to have
access to any of these internal private Networks and Hosts identified
by these IP Addresses. Thus, there would be no conflict from there
continued use!

Nonetheless, this line of logical reasoning can be and is applied
throughout the expansion of the IPv4 Class Addressing Scheme, as
denoted by Table 4. Where it can be concluded that, regardless of IP
Address Range, that being 32, 64, 128, or 256 Bit, it does not matter.
This method of mathematical calculation would still apply. In which
case, this white paper concludes; There yet remains a value in the
IPv4 Addressing Scheme, which surpasses the promises of IPv6, and
could conceivably satisfy our needs indefinitely without an expansion
beyond the 32 Bit address range. That is, if it were distributed with
country and or state codes as its prefix.

                   and 32,004 Hosts:  10

                      2,097,151 Networks and 254 Hosts:110

Appendix II : The Mathematical Anomaly Explained

Nonetheless, this mathematical issue is an argument concerning,
whether or not there exist a 'One-to-One' Correspondence between the
Mathematical Calculations involving the Decimals (represented as
Intehers) and those concerning the Binary Operators (Logical
Expressions; the Truth Table values of 1's and 0's). Needless to say,
this Mathematical Anomaly becomes even more apparent when one observes
the Class B situation. Where by:

1. Class B; 128 -191, IP Address Range
   Default Subnet Mask; 255.255.000.000
   (Which yields: 2^14 Networks and 2^16 Hosts;
   that is, 16,384 Networks and 65,536 Hosts.)

However, this total is not the correct method of enumeration,
and it is not the actual number (Integer Number) of available
networks. And this FACT becomes even more apparent when the
Binary Translation of the Decimal (Integers) Numbers is
completed. That is, the result would yield 64 Binary
Numerical Representations, ONE for each of the Decimal numbers
(Integers) that are available in the IP Address for the Class B.
Where Class B should maintain the representation
(Which provides the actual Integer enumeration for the
calculation of the total IP Addresses available.
In other words, their independent count, of their respective
totals for the Actual Number of Available IP Addresses in the
Class B should Equal 64.) given by:

2. Class B: 128 -191, (Which equal the total of 64
   possible IP Addresses for the given Address Range)
   Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.000.000
   9Which results in 64^2 Networks and 254^2 Hosts;
   that is, 4,096 Networks and 64,516 Hosts.)

Nevertheless, an enumeration or break down count
association, of each representation, that is, Binary and Decimal.
Would indeed, provide a greater support for the conclusion presented
thus far. Where by, given the Classes noted in 1 & 2 above. We have:

1a. (128 + 128 + 128 + 128 + ...+ 128) = 128 x 128 = 2^14
        1     2     3     4  ...  -  128 = Total Count

Which equal the Total number of Networks for the Given Address
Range.

and

1b. (255 + 255 + 255 + 255 +...+ 255) = 255 x 255 = 2^16
        1     2     3     4 ...  - 255 = Total Count

Which equals the Total Number of Hosts for the Given Address
Range.

While noting that these equations represent the Binary Method
for determining the number of Networks and Hosts for the given
Address Range of Class B. However, keeping this in mind, notice
the difference that exist when this same calculation is used
for the Decimal (Integer) representation.

2a. (64 + 64 + 64 + 64 +...+ 64) = 64 x 64 = 64^2
       1    2    3    4  ... - 64 = Total Count


Where this number equals the number of Networks for the
Given Address Range assigned to Class B.

And

2b. (254 + 254 + 254 + 254 +...+ 254) = 254 x 254 = 254^2
        1     2     3     4 ...  -  254 = Total Count

Where this equation represent the Total Number of Hosts for
the Given Address Range of Class B.

In other words, given the equation (191 -128) + 1 = 64.
We are then presented with the Total Number of Addresses
available for the given Address Range, 128 - 191, for the
Class B. Where it can be seen that, any One-to-One mapping
of the Numbers in the Address Range and the Counting
Numbers (Integers), beginning with 1. Should yield the
Total Number of Addresses available in any Count, for
the Determination of the Total Number of Networks. And
this same line of reasoning applies to the Host count, as
well.

['Where the Subscript Number equals the Value of
 the Total Number of Availabe IP Addresses (a
 One-to-One  Correspondence between the Enumeration
 of, and the Address Ranges given) for the Network
 and Host Ranges in Class B. Where both Binary and
 Decimal Number representations are the given examples.']

Nevertheless, when the Decimal and Binary conversion
is completed. That is, when you establish a One-to-One
relationship between the Binary and Decimal Numbers.
You would discover that the their respective totals
would be the same. That is, there can only be 64 Binary
numbers and 64 Decimal numbers for the calculation
of the Total Number of Networks. And there can only be
254 Binary Numbers and 254 Decimal Numbers for the
calculation of the Total Number of Hosts. The difference is
that, the former method reveals the Binary calculation, while
the latter is the Integer (called the Decimal) Calculation.
Needless to say, it should be very clear that the Binary
method is a Logical Expression, and does see the Integer Count,
that is the 'Difference between the Range Boundaries Plus 1'.
Which yields the total number of available IP Addresses to be
used to determine the actual number of Hosts within a given IP
Address Class Range. Clearly, the Decimal method is indeed a
Mathematical Expression representing the operations involving the
Integers.

Needless to say, if you are confused or are in doubt of these
conclusions. Then my suggestion, would be to present my findings
to a Professor of Mathematics at some well established university.

Appendix III : A Peak into the Classless IP System
                   (Are the Advantages Real?)

The main point of CLASSLESS ADDRESSING (CIDR), concerns Routing, and
the Router's Route Table Size. However, while this does speak of the
so-called "Classless System as being a Boon for IP Address Management.
The reality is that, it is nothing more than a conformation in reason/
justification, of the Error that the IPv4 Class System maintained. In
other words, even with CIDR, the problem of understanding the
difference between the Binary and the Decimal Mathematical Operations
still exist. Needless to say, this system established a means to
combine several smaller networks into one larger network, and provided
a 'One (Internet) Route Path with a
Mulit-IP-Network-Address-Thoroughfare'.

Nonetheless, the BAND-AID is clearly short lived, because it still
uses the same IP System of Addressing. So- What is the Advantage?

        1. Housing several Smaller Networks under One Large Network.
           (Big Boy Little Boy. The Bully Scenario, because we know
           who pay's who!  (CIDR)

        2. Since the Mathematical Error was never corrrected, the
           Calculated total Number of available IP Addresses is
           still wrong. And it is for this reason, that someone has
           to pay someone else. (IPv4 Expansion)

In other words, the only real advantage of CIDR is that of improved
Router performance. Surely it can be clearly seen, that the
UNADDRESSED Mathematical Error was the cause for the restructuring
of the IP Addressing Scheme, under the guise of CLASSLESS SYSTEM.
But who's Fooled? Especially since, the IP Class Address Range still
governs this Invisible Class: called "CLASSLESS". Nonetheless, if
you are in doubt of this conclusion, then ignore the recommendations.
However, if it is the Internet you are connecting to- You will not
obtain a connection! In short- Stay within the assigned boundaries
of the assigned IP Address Class Range. Nevertheless, the conclusions
of this white paper remain unchanged.

(For a more detailed explanation of CIDR, See Reference Section, # 7)

[Special Note: My original discovery of the Mathematical Anomaly
               dealt with 'Determining the Address Ranges for
               each Subnet'. This meant that the Subnet IP
               Address was not counted in the calculation of
               the Total Number of available IP Addresses,
               within the given IP Address Range for any
               given IP Class. It was not counted because it
               was being used. Which meant an error of +1
               in calculating the total number of IP Addresses
               available. 'Mr. Alun Jones' informed me of this
               error in my calculations. That change is
               reflected in this writing.]
