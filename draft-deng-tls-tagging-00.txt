1  Introduction

   The document discusses the motivation and use-cases for coding third-
   party aware tags for content/source related information into resource
   retrieval process.

2  Motivating Scenario







2.1 Reverse Charging

   The dominating billing method is subscriber-oriented model, which is
   used by the operator to charge the subscriber for the volume of or
   expected bandwidth for the Internet traffic he consumes for a given
   period of time (e.g. on a monthly basis). In practice, such model is
   implemented by the network devices monitoring the flows targeted to
   or originated from  a given subscriber (e.g. local IP address). 

   However, reverse charging is becoming a desirable new billing method,
   which is motivated from ICPs, who want to cooperative with the ISPs
   to enable free-access to its content/service from the subscribers to
   attract users, especially the mobile subscribers. The key to enable
   such billing model is how to effectively distinguish the traffic
   flows belonging to the same content/application which might be
   comprised of complex  groups of IP flows from others. The current
   subscriber-based billing model is not very helpful in such scenario.

3  Requirements

3.1 Identifying the content

   In order to improve the hit ratio and actively push the hot resources
   to the local subscribers, the cache system need a succinct way to
   learn the buffered contents and can judge the hot content according
   to the actual content information. 

3.2 Identifying the source

   To enable flexible reverse charging, we need a third party
   recognizable tag of the traffic for the charging GW located between
   the client and server, which helps in recognition of its source and
   billing model, and other features to enable other cultivated
   transport services, e.g. QoS for selected content types for a given

   ICP.

4 Challenges




4.1 On identifying the source

   It is expected that tag for the source in the reverse charging case
   is independent of IP address and above of IP layer, since source IP
   is not working for CDN cases. 

   The tag is expected to also provide information about content type
   for finer-grained charging policies, as the diversity of network
   applications has high demand for the charging policy flexibility,
   e.g. a single application may produce both video traffic and audio
   traffic, which decides to promote its upgraded video service for free
   while keeping its commercial voice service intact.

4.2 On tagging the encrypted traffic

   Another big challenge for third-party resource tagging is encryption.
   If the tag is added at the application layer and encrypted end-to-
   end, that would block a cache or charging GW to retrieval the
   embedded information.
