Abstract

   This document defines a new name form for inclusion in the otherName
   filed of an X.509 Subject Alternative Name extension which allows a

   Record.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 2782 [N3] Defines a DNS RR (Resource Record) for specifying the
   location of services (SRV RR) which allows clients to ask for a
   specific service/protocol for a specific domain and get back the
   names of any available servers.

   Current defined dNSName GeneralName name forms only provide for DNS
   host names to be expressed in "preferred name syntax," as specified
   by RFC 1034 [N4]. This definition is not broad enough to allow
   expression of a SRV RR. To accommodate expression of a SRV RR in
   X.509 certificates this document therefore defines an otherName for
   SRV RR.

   As DNS query based on an SRV RR returns the name of the host
   currently available for the requested service, reasonable subsequent
   authentication of that host as the appropriate host for the service
   will require the host to demonstrate that it is an authorized to
   provide the requested service.

   The ability to associate a host with a SRV RR in an X.509 certificate
   therefore facilitates the binding of the host to the originally
   requested SRV RR in order to protect against DNS spoofing attacks
   where an altered DNS could return the host name of a rouge or hacked
   host.

   One example where expression of a SRV RR can be very useful is to
   identify a host as a legitimate Kerberos KDC server.

2.  SRV RR otherName

   This section defines the SRVRRName as a form of otherName from the
   GeneralName structure in SubjectAltName.

   The SRVRRName if present MUST contain a Service Resource Record (SRV
   RR) formed according to RFC 2782 [N3].

   The use of a SRVRRName is OPTIONAL. The SRVRRName is defined as
   follows:

      id-on-sRVRRName   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on ? }

      SRVRRName ::= IA5String



3  Security Considerations

   Since assignment of services to hosts may be subject to change,
   implementers should be aware of the issues involved with transfer and
   suspension of services between different hosts to make sure that
   issued certificates are up to date and that old inaccurate
   certificates are revoked.
