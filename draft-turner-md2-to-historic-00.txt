Internet-Draft          MD2 to Historic Status                 May 2010 
    

   This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's Legal 
   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents 
   (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of 
   publication of this document. Please review these documents

1. Introduction 

   MD2 [MD2] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input a message 
   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or 
   "message digest" of the input.  This document recommends that MD2 be 
   retired.  Specifically, this document recommends RFC 1319 [MD2] be 
   moved to Historic status.  The reasons for taking this action are 
   discussed. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119]. 

2. Rationale 

   MD2 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since its 
   publication, MD2 has been shown to not be collision free 
   [MD2-Collisions].  In fact, RSA, in 1996, suggested that MD2 should 
   not be used [RSA-AdviceOnMD2]. 

3. Documents that Reference RFC 1319 

   MD2 has been specified in the following RFCs: 

   Proposed Standard (PS): 

      o [RFC2246] The TLS Protocol Version 1.0. 

      o [RFC2459] Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate 
        and CRL Profile. 

      o [RFC3279] Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 
        Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate 
        Revocation List (CRL) Profile.

Internet-Draft          MD2 to Historic Status                 May 2010 
    

      o [RFC4572] Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the 
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session 
        Description Protocol (SDP). 

   Informational: 

      o [RFC2313] PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5. 

      o [RFC2315] PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax Version 1.5. 

      o [RFC2437] PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.0. 

      o [RFC2898] PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification 
        Version 2.0. 

      o [RFC3447] Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA 
        Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1. 

   Experimental: 

      o [RFC2660] The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol. 

   Historic: 

      o [RFC1423] Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail: 
        Part III: Algorithms, Modes, and Identifiers.  

4. Impact of Moving MD2 to Historic. 

   The impact of moving MD2 to Historic on the RFCs specified in Section 
   3 is minimal, as described below.   

   Concentrating on the PS RFCs: 

      o MD2 support in TLS was dropped in TLS 1.1.  Additionally, many 
        TLS implementations, OpenSSL, Network Security Services, and 
        GNUTLS, have disabled support for MD2.  

      o MD2 support is optional in [RFC4572], and SHA-1 is specified as 
        the preferred algorithm.  

      o MD2 is included in the original PKIX certificate profile 
        [RFC2459] and the PKIX algorithm document [RFC3279] for 
        compatibility with older applications, but its use is 
        discouraged.  SHA-1 is identified as the preferred algorithm 
        for the Internet PKI.

   Looking at the Informational RFCs: 

      o PKCS#1 [RFC2313] indicates that support MD2 is only retained 
        for compatibility with existing applications.  One of the 
        motivations for updating PKCS#1 was to add support for 
        algorithms such as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. 

      o PKCS#5 [RFC2898] recommends that the Password Based Encryption 
        Scheme (PBES) that uses MD2 not be used for new applications.  

      o PKCS#7 [RFC2315] was replaced by a series of standards track 
        publications, "Cryptographic Message Syntax" [RFC2630] 
        [RFC3369] [RFC3852] [RFC5652] and "Cryptographic Message Syntax 
        (CMS) Algorithms" [RFC3370]. Support for MD2 was dropped in 
        [RFC3370].  

   RFC 2818 "HTTP Over TLS", which does not reference MD2, largely 
   supplanted implementation of RFC 2660.  S/MIME has largely replaced 
   implementations of PEM.  Support for MD2 was dropped in S/MIME v3.1 
   [RFC3851].  

5. Recommendation 

   Implementers have been warned for many years not to implement MD2 due 
   to its lack of collision resistance.  It is RECOMMENDED that [MD2] be 
   moved to Historic Status. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   None. 

7. Security Considerations 

   MD2 MUST continue to be considered non-collision resistant.
