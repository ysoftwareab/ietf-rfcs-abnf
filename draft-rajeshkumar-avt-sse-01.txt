Abstract 
 
This document defines a mechanism to signal state changes using RTP packets 
called State Signaling Events (SSEs). The proposed MIME type is  "audio/sse". 
SSE messages  signal a media state which has no specified duration. In general, 
media state changes result in a two-way synchronization handshake via SSEs. 
 
 
1 Introduction 
 
1.1 Terminology 
 
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be 
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [7] and indicate requirement levels for 
compliant implementations.  
 
1.2 Motivation for an RTP-based State Signaling Mechanism 
 
This signaling mechanism (SSEs) was initially proposed to the TIA [4] and 
subsequently used by the ITU SG16 as a key element of on-going MoIP 
standardization work [Q11, Ref. 14]. This mechanism was initially meant to 
address a need for fast media state synchronization in V.MoIP. Without such 
fast synchronization, high speed modem operation is not possible.  This is also 
true for high-speed, V.34 faxes. 
 
1.3 Applicability to Fax Relay 
 
We recommend that applications that implement both MoIP and FoIP also support 
this mechanism for group 3 fax relay in addition to V.34 fax relay and modem 
relay. When such a mechanism is mandated on the basis of one set of drivers 
(e.g. MoIP and V.34 fax), it is cost-effective to make it available as a common 
synchronization mechanism for other contexts such as group 3 fax relay. For a 
call that supports a range of capabilities, we  deem it unwise to mandate the 
use of external signaling control (e.g. SIP or call agent) for group 3 fax 
relay, while mandating fast synchronization for modem relay. This is does not 
diminish the utility of external signaling mechanisms for media changes in call 
contexts that support a group 3 fax capability, but not modem relay or V.34 fax 
capabilities.

1.4 Scope and Limitation of State Signaling Events (SSEs) 
 
State Signaling Events are RTP-encoded event messages that coordinate switches 
between different media states as defined in Section . The combination of a 
port and an RTP payload type defines an SSE stream. An SSE stream governs: 
  
 
* a flow consisting of multiple media streams. When such a flow is defined and 
contains an SSE stream [19], then the SSE stream governs all the remaining 
media streams in that flow. These streams may span several ports. 
 
* all media streams/ports explicitly associated with the MIME definition at 
call establishment, if the explicit association is elected. 
 
* the media stream associated with the port to which the SSEs are sent, if the 
SSEs are not part of a flow, or are explicitly associated with ports via the 
MIME definition. 
 
  
To multiplex the RTP-based SSEs with media packets, it is necessary for the 
media packets to be RTP, or a non-RTP media format that has a payload type 
discriminator in the same position as RTP. To permit proper identification, the 
payload type values associated with the  non-RTP media packets SHOULD NOT 
overlap with values assigned to RTP encodings, including SSEs. An example of 
such a non-RTP encoding is SPRT [14] proposed for modem relay.   
  
      
The use of the SSE mechanism to switch from RTP media to the use of non-RTP 
media (such as UDPTL-encapsulated ITU T.38 Group 3 fax relay [10]) on the same 
or different UDP port is possible. If the SSEs share a port with the T.38  
media stream, then they cannot be use used to synchronize the switchback since 
SSE messages cannot be interleaved with UDPTL packets. This is not a 
significant drawback, since the end of T.38 fax relay can be detected 
independently at each end of an fax relay session, and can result in a pre-
determined action such as switchback to voice, or session termination for 
signaled (non-provisioned) sessions.  
 
The SSE Protocol Operation (Section ) is described for bidirectional RTP/RTP-
compatible media streams or groups of media streams between two session users.  
One transmitter and receiver is associated with each session user. A session 
user, or endpoint,  is located in a "gateway" that converts between an IP media 
stream and a TDM or analog signal.   
 
In multimedia applications, video media use a different port from audio media. 
No SSEs have been defined for use with video media, but such extensions are not 
precluded by this document (Section ).  
 
The application of the SSE protocol to multicast media streams is an object of 
further study.

2 Definition of Media States 
 
For the purposes of this document, "media state" is defined in terms of the   
ultimate use of the media.  The definition is similar, though not identical, to 
that of the MIME media type registered by IANA [15] and used as the "media 
type" parameter in SDP [2].    
 
As a background, some of the media types described in [2] and [15] are: 
 
     * Audio. This includes voice and voiceband data content. 
 
     * Video. 
 
     * Data. 
 
     * Application 
 
     * Control. 
 
     * Image. 
 
     * Multipart. 
      
     * Text. 
 
     * Message. 
 
     * Model. 
 
The current document defines the following values of the media state parameter: 
 
     *    Audio. This refers to the content intended for the human ear, rather  
          than modulated data. Note the subtle difference from the MIME media  
          type "audio". 
           
     *    Voiceband data. This refers to data modulated as a voiceband signal. 
          This data could be modem or facsimile data. Using the definition of 
          media type [2 & 15], this is subsumed under  "audio". 
      
     *    Fax Relay. No further restriction is placed: the fax signal could be 
          group 3, V.34 etc., and could be encapsulated in T.38 UDPTL packets, 
          or in RTP packets (currently under study). Using the definition of 
          media type [15], the media state "Fax Relay" is subsumed under the 
          value "image".  
      
     *    Modem Relay. Although the current MoIP work [14] does not use RTP, 
          the definition of media state "Modem Relay" in this document does not 
          place this restriction. In the current modem relay definition, a 
          baseband (unmodulated) data signal is  encapsulated within an SPRT 
          (Simple Packet Relay Transport). Although SPRT is not RTP,  it has a 
          payload type field in the same position as RTP. Further, for media

                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
          streams that could be switched between RTP and SPRT, SPRT MUST NOT 
          use payload types assigned to RTP encodings. Using the definition of 
          media type [15], the media state "Modem Relay" is subsumed under the 
          value "application".  
      
     *    Text Relay. This media stream is a simple sequence of text characters 
          [18]. This is primarily used in TDD (Telecommunications Device for 
          the Disabled) applications. 
      
No media  state is currently defined for n x 64 clear channel data, 
commensurate with the user state  "circuit" defined for circuit emulation in 
AAL2 [5]. There are no current RTP encodings or on-going standardization 
activities in this area. Such encodings would typically be used for 
unmodulated, baseband data streams such as those produced by an ISDN end-
subscriber equipment. A basic requirement is bit integrity of the composite n x 
64 kbps, precluding the use of robbed-bit CAS signaling, and TDM line codes 
that violate bit-level transparency to achieve clock density. Other basic 
requirements are low, controlled latencies and error rates, objectives that are 
not characteristic of most IP networks of today. 
 
Media states are represented numerically (Section ). The State Signaling Event 
(SSE) protocol defined in this document is used,  by compliant implementations, 
to synchronize shifts between these media states, and other media states which 
MAY be defined in the future (Section ).   
 
Apart from the high-level definitions in this section, this document does not 
intend to detail the range of media properties associated with each media 
state. These properties, which are negotiated as active  or latent capabilities 
at the time of session establishment [2 & 16], SHOULD be found in the existing 
and planned ITU, IETF etc. standards specifications which define VoIP [12], 
Voiceband Data [10, 14, 17],  modem relay [14] and fax relay [10] applications. 
The following observations can, however, be made with respect to these media 
states:  
 
*    The audio media state includes the entire range of audio codecs that 
     conform to the RTP/AVP profile [12]. 
 
*    The voiceband data media state is used, to transmit modem and fax signals. 
     It is associated with a unique encoding name, "vbd", which is dynamically 
     mapped into one or more  RTP payload types [17]. As described in [17], 
     each instance of  the "vbd" payload type MAY be further associated with 
     format-specific parameters which define the underlying audio encoding. 
     Since voiceband data has a much lower distortion tolerance, not all audio 
     encodings are suitable for use with voiceband data. Some examples of 
     encodings suitable for voiceband data are PCMU, PCMA, G726-40 and G726-32. 
     Voiceband data requires the absence of any DC removal filters in the 
     encoding algorithm. (PCM and ADPCM do not have any.) Silence suppression 
     and voice packet loss concealment algorithms, which work well with voice,  
     cannot  be used with voiceband data, which requires a continuous carrier 
     signal. Unlike voice, voiceband data is found to work best with fixed 
     jitter buffers rather than adaptive jitter buffers.

*    The common fax relay format is per the ITU T.38 specification, and it uses 
     non-RTP, UDPTL packets. 
 
*    The common modem relay format is the non-RTP, SPRT format currently under 
     study [14]. 
 
When an SSE payload type governs more than one port, then the media state is 
associated with the entire set of ports. In this case, the media properties 
described on the different ('m=') lines need not have resources allocated to 
them until activation of the corresponding  local media state (Section ). 
 
3 RTP Packet Format for State Signaling Events 
 
The payload format for State Signaling Events described below is suitable for 
both end-to-end and gateway contexts. The generation of State Signaling Events 
by an endpoint has no impact on the simultaneous generation of other RTP 
payload formats such a audio [12], telephone events and telephone tones [1], or 
of RTP-compatible formats such as SPRT [14]. If on the same port, it is 
distinguished from these other formats by its unique, dynamic payload type.  
 
The RTP payload format for State Signaling Events is designated as "sse". The 
MIME type is designated as "audio/sse", pending registration [Section ]. 
 
In conformance with the Internet Protocol, all fields are carried in network 
byte order, that is, most significant byte (octet) first. Within a byte, the 
most significant bit is transmitted first. This byte order is commonly known as 
big-endian. In this specification, bytes and bits shown on the left are more 
significant. 
 
3.1 Use of RTP Header Fields 
 
  
SSRC: State Signaling Events MAY use one of  the SSRC values sent to one of the 
port(s) they govern. Alternately, the use of a unique SSRC dedicated to SSEs is 
not precluded. In either case, SSEs qualify all media stream(s) sent to the 
port(s) they qualify. 
 
Timestamp: The RTP timestamp reflects when a local decision is made to issue 
the SSE message, in response to either an internal event or a received SSE 
message. It serves to distinguish between consecutive SSE messages sent by an 
entity. 
  
Marker bit: Since SSEs have no duration, the marker field is a don't care.  For 
SSEs, receivers SHALL ignore the RTP marker bit. Transmitters SHOULD set it to 
1.  
 
Parenthetically, for audio media, a marker value of 1 can indicate the 
beginning of a talkspurt. For RFC 2833 telephone events, it can indicate the 
beginning of a new event rather than the continuation of a previous event.

The payload format for State Signaling Events without payload extension 
(extension bit set to 0) is shown in Fig. 1.  The payload format for State 
Signaling Events with payload extension (extension bit set to 1) is shown in 
Fig. 2. All fields, except the extension length and extension information 
fields, are the same as in Fig. 1. In this case, it is possible to attach a 
variable number of  extension bits at the end of the payload.

event:    The events are encoded as shown in Section .  
          The number of bits available for representing state  
          signaling events is 8. Extensions of event numbering into  
          the area of reserved bits is possible, but unnecessary at 
          present. 
 
E:        "End" bit. Although this field is a donÆt care for State  
          Signaling Events, it is preferable to always set to 1 in all 
          State Signaling Event messages, including all redundant copies. 
          Receivers SHOULD tolerate and ignore either value of this bit. 
 
X:        "Extension" bit. If set to 0, then the SSE payload does not have a 
          payload extension at the end (Figure 1). Otherwise, there is a 
          payload extension (Figure 2). 
 
PP:       "Priority/Precedence" bit. A value of zero indicates normal  
          priority/precedence. A value of one indicates a high priority/  
          precedence.   
 
cause code: This is an six-bit code that indicates the rationale for sending  
          the SSE message. The rationale could be a local event detection, a  
          a received SSE message,  or a combination of local events and 
          received SSE messages.  A value of all zeros is  a null cause code, 
          indicating non-communication of the rationale for sending an SSE 
          message. The receiver MAY then use a default value if it needs to. 
          Distinct events MAY share cause codes, or MAY have cause codes that 
          are unique to the event. However, note that the cause code space for 
          each event is distinct. 
           
cause code information:  This 15-bit field is used to provide additional 
          information associated with the cause code. For instance, if the 
          cause code refers to the modem CM (call menu) signal, this field MAY 
          be used to indicate the actual CM bits. If the cause code is null, 
          then this field is always null regardless of its value. Also, a value 
          of all zeros indicates a null cause code information field.

extension length:   This 16-bit field is used to indicate the number of 
         extension bits after it. Obviously, a value of all zeros in the 
         extension length field, although permissible, is not useful. This 
         field exists only if the extension (X) bit is 1.  
 
extension information:   This field consists of a variable number of bits, 
         indicated by the extension length field.   
 
The extension length and extension information are meant to allow future 
extensions of the SSE protocol. 
 
  
4 Reliability 
 
4.1 Use of simple packet repetition 
 
Redundant transmission of State Signaling Event messages is RECOMMENDED. A 
receiver acts on the first redundant message it receives. Except for 
incrementing the sequence number count, it ignores the remaining redundant SSE 
messages. Although they have different sequence numbers, redundant SSE messages 
have identical timestamps.   
 
Along the lines of AAL2 type 3 user state control messages [5], SSE packets 
SHOULD be repeated three times, at 20 ms intervals. The number of repetitions 
and the repetition interval can be a provisionable parameter, with 3 times and 
20 ms as the default. Identical provisioning of different nodes in a network is 
desirable, but not necessary.   
 
4.2 Use of RFC 2198-based redundancy 
 
It is possible to combine the SSE payload with other RTP payloads, including 
itself, within an RFC 2198 payload [9] in a manner similar to that for Named 
Telephone Events [1]. When this is done, the association between the different 
constituents of an RFC 2198 payload MUST be defined at session establishment 
using SDP or another protocol such as H.245.   
 
Simple repetitive redundancy and RFC 2198 redundancy SHOULD NOT be 
simultaneously used for SSEs.

                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
An implementation need not support RFC 2198 encapsulation of SSEs in order  to 
be compliant with this document.  Further, it must be noted that there is 
little bandwidth incentive to use RFC 2198 encapsulation in conjunction with 
State Signaling Events, since they are relatively infrequent. 
 
5 Indication of Receiver Capabilities using SDP 
 
5.1 Indication of the Support of Media Properties 
 
Properties associated with a media state MUST be advertised via SDP (or a 
similar protocol such as H.245) before an SSE is used to indicate it. It is not 
the intention of this document to specify how SDP MAY be used to describe the 
properties of audio, voiceband data, fax relay or modem relay media. The basics 
of audio data media description are in RFC 2327 [2]. Other documents expand on 
these  requirements, such the SDP description of one specific redundancy method 
in RFC 2198 [9]. The SDP description of Fax Relay sessions is found in Annex D 
of ITU T.38 [10]. Recently, work has been done towards the explicit designation  
of media encoding formats for Voiceband Data [17] and Modem Relay [4 & 14]. 
Work has also been done towards the description of media capabilities, some of 
which MAY be latent, in SDP [16].  Work on equivalent H.245 descriptions of 
these media capabilities has been done, or is in progress. 
 
5.2 Indication of SSE Support 
 
Indication of SSE support via SDP is similar to the indication of telephone 
event support via SDP [1]. This document is limited to describing the 
indication of SSE support in SDP.  Work is being done in  ITU SG16  to 
formulate H.245 descriptions of SSE support.  
 
For a given session, the dynamic payload type for State Signaling Events is 
different from the dynamic payload type for rfc2833 Network Telephone Events. 
Since these represent distinct capabilities,  assigning different MIME types to 
telephone events and state signaling events permits separate definition and 
possible extension of these mechanisms. An RTP endpoint advertising support for 
telephone-events need not advertise support for state signaling events. 
 
To indicate support for State Signaling Events, the receiver MUST associate a 
dynamic payload type with the encoding name æsseÆ corresponding to the proposed 
MIME type audio/sse. This is done via the ærtpmapÆ attribute: 
 
     a=rtpmap:<payload type> sse/<clock rate> 
 
Although the clock rate is not very useful for SSEs, it must be included for 
compatibility with RFC 2327 [2]. It does no harm to set it to 8000 in all 
instances, regardless of the possible timestamp rate(s) of the media stream 
being qualified by the State Signaling Events.  
 
The following example, 
 
     a=rtpmap:97 sse/8000

indicates that an RTP payload type of 97 is associated with State Signaling 
Events. 
 
Receivers indicate which State Signaling Events they can receive through an 
æfmtpÆ format line: 
 
   a=fmtp:<format> <list of values> 
 
The <format> parameter is the  dynamically assigned RTP payload type in the 
'rtpmap' attribute. The list of values consists of comma-separated elements, 
which can be either a single decimal number or two decimal numbers separated by 
a hyphen (dash), where the second number is larger than the first. No 
whitespace is allowed between numbers or hyphens. The list does not have to be 
sorted. 
 
If a receiver does not enumerate the events it supports, none may be assumed by 
default. As a result of this omission, the SSE payload type declaration, 
although syntactically valid, is not very useful. 
 
Receivers MAY  indicate whether cause codes (Section ) MAY be sent for any of 
the events supported: 
 
     a=fmtp:<format> sseCauseCodeEnable=<yes/no> 
 
If omitted, then a transmitter MAY not assume their support, unless it is aware 
of their support by other means (e.g. hardcoding, provisioning etc.). 
 
Receivers MAY  indicate the port numbers governed by an SSE stream. Recall that 
an SSE stream is a combination of port number and SSE payload type. The 
SSEscope attribute MAY be used to bind this stream to a set of ports, which may 
or may not include the port on which the SSEs are received. If omitted, then an 
SSE payload type value governs the port or flow [19] on which it is received. 
 
The  SSEscope attribute is expressed as: 
 
     a=fmtp:<format> SSEscope=<portNumber1> <portNumber3>...<portNumber3> 
 
where the port numbers are assigned to media streams within the session. 
 
 
The following example, 
 
     a=rtpmap:97 sse/8000 
     a=fmtp:97 192,194,200,203 
 
indicates a willingness to receive State Signaling Events 192, 194, 200 and 
203. No willingness to receive cause codes with any State Signaling Event is 
indicated; however, this may be inferred by default or by provisioning. The 
meaning of these events is defined later. Contrariwise,  
 
     a=rtpmap:97 sse/8000 
     a=fmtp:97 192,194,200,203

explicitly indicates a willingness to receive State Signaling Events 192, 194, 
200 and 203 along with all cause codes defined for these SSEs in standards 
documents.   
 
The lines 
 
     a=rtpmap:97 sse/8000

     a=fmtp:97 SSEscope=49230 49238 49375 
 
indicate that SSEs with payload type 97 govern all media streams sent to ports 
49230, 49238 and 49375. None of these need be the port to which the SSEs are 
sent. 
 
The following sample media type definition corresponds to the SDP example 
above: 
 
     audio/sse;events="192,194,200,203"; 
sseCauseCodeEnable="yes";SSEscope="49230 49238 49375"  
 
An implementation SHOULD NOT transmit a state signaling event whose support has 
not been explicitly indicated, via SDP [2] or an equivalent ITU H.245 [8] 
mechanism,  by the receiver. If such a state signaling event is received, it 
MAY be ignored.

The media states in  are defined in Section . Each SSE is an indication of 
status. By sending a specific SSE, a gateway or endpoint is indicating its 
local media state with respect to a specific media stream (port).  
  
6.3 SSE Protocol Operation 
  
At present, the SSE protocol does not apply to multicast media streams (Section 
). 
  
For a media stream (port) or set of media streams (ports or 'flow') governed by 
an SSE payload type value, the "local" media state represents the view of the 
gateway or endpoint regarding the media state. The "remote" media state 
represents the corresponding view of the remote endpoint, communicated via 
SSEs. The "SSE protocol state" for the port or ports  is a pair consisting of 
the local and remote media states. 
 
The local state (represented by S) can take on the following values (based on 
Section ): 
 
     a:   audio, not including voiceband data 
     v:   voiceband data 
     f:   fax relay (FR) 
     m:   modem relay (MR) 
     t:   text relay (TR). 
 
In addition to all of these values, the remote state (represented by S') can 
take on the following value: 
 
     i:   indeterminate.   
 
For the port(s) governed by an SSE payload type value, an SSE protocol state, 
P, that is a composite of the local and remote media states is defined. 
Expressed as a pair, P = (S, S'). 
 
On initialization, the audio media state is the "base" state of any SSE-driven 
media state machine. Thus, on initialization, S = S' = a and  (S, S') = (a, a). 
 
6.3.1 SSE Generation Rules 
 
Consider a change in the SSE protocol state from P1 = (S1, S1') to P2 = (S2, 
S2'), where one or both of the following propositions is true:   
 
     S1 != S2 
     S1' != S2'.  
 
On any change in the SSE protocol state from P1 = (S1, S1') to P2 = (S2, S2'), 
an SSE indicating media state S2 SHALL be sent to the remote endpoint or 
gateway, except for case in which (S1' != S2') && (S1 == S2) && (S2 == S2'). In 
this last case, an SSE indicating media state S2 SHALL NOT be sent. In the last 
case, the SSE message indicates that the remote end has changed  to a media  
state that is  identical to the local media state, which is itself unchanged. 
This can only happen in  response to a prior SSE sent to the remote end. To

                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
send an SSE again with an identical media state is unnecessary and would 
introduce a three-way handshake into the protocol. 
 
In the context of protocol error recovery, the gateway or endpoint is permitted 
to re-send the audio SSE on timeout expiration (Section ), even though there 
has been no change in protocol state.   
 
It is not the intention of this document to delineate all the events that can 
cause the local media state, S1, to change. One such event is the receipt of an 
SSE (Section ). Other, local events are specific to MoIP, FoIP, ToIP 
applications, and are expected to be listed in standards or interoperability 
documents related to these applications. Such documents are expected to specify 
any permissible variability in setting the local media state in response to 
local triggers, and the means for maintaining viable operation in the face of  
such variability. For example, endpoints and gateways might be allowed to 
respond to a V.21 fax preamble by setting the local media state, S, to v 
(Voiceband Data) or f (fax relay). The declaration of the necessary media 
parameters and capabilities (via H.245 or SDP) at connection establishment, and 
the SSE-based coordination of the media state switch on detection of the V.21 
fax preamble are necessary ingredients of ensuring interoperability between 
different gateway/endpoint designs, configurations etc. 
  
 
6.3.2 Media State Transition  Rules  
 
By definition, on receipt of a new SSE message, the remote media state, S', is 
set to the media state (a, v, f, m, t) indicated in the SSE. 
 
 
The setting of the local media state, S, on receipt of a new SSE message 
depends on a number of factors such as: 
 
* Permitted media states. See the list below. 
* Current resource availability. 
* Support of the media state by the design. 
* SSE priority/precedence (PP) value. Per section , PP = 0 or 1.  
   
 
 
The permitted local media states on receipt of a new SSE are: 
 
1.   If (S' == a), then S = a. 
 
2.   If (S' == v) && (PP==0), then S = a | v. 
 
3.   If (S' == f) && (PP==0), then S = a | v | f. 
 
4.   If (S' == m) && (PP==0), then S = a | v | m. 
 
5.   If (S' == t) && (PP==0), then S = a | v | t. 
 
6.   If (S' == v) && (PP==1), then S = v.

                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
 
7.   If (S' == f) && (PP==1), then S = f. 
 
8.   If (S' == m) && (PP==1), then S = m. 
 
9.   If (S' == t) && (PP==1), then S = t. 
 
  
These rules (1-9) limit the freedom of a compliant endpoint or gateway with 
respect to local media state change on receipt of an SSE message. Any 
contravention of these rules MUST be handled via the recovery procedures in 
Section . Particular implementations MAY further limit the range of values for 
the local media state in response to an SSE. 
 
Per rule 1, when an SSE indicating the audio media state is received, a 
compliant implementation MUST change the local media state (for the port(s) in 
question) to audio. There is no choice, since the audio media state is the 
"base" state of any SSE-driven media state machine.  
 
Rules 2-5 assume a priority/precedence value of 0 (normal). Rules 6-9 assume a 
priority/precedence value of 1 (high). 
 
Rule 2 allows the possibility of not changing to a VBD media state when the 
other side indicates that is has changed media state to VBD. Such a choice is 
application-specific. 
 
Rules 3, 4 and 5 allow the possibility of not setting the local media state to 
match the remote media state, and of, instead, selecting the audio or VBD as 
the local state. Again, such a choice is application-specific.  
 
When the priority/precedence indication (PP) is set to high, then compliant 
implementations SHALL set the local media state to match the remote media 
state. This is indicated in rules 6-9. An inability to comply SHALL result in 
invocation of the recovery procedures in Section .  _ 
 
Note that there is no possibility of setting the local media state to, say, fax 
relay, when the remote end indicates, say, modem relay. If the gateway or 
endpoint is already has a local state, S1 = (f, m, t) and a received SSE 
indicates a remote state, S2' = (f, m, t) such that S1 != S2', then an out-of-
context SSE has been received. It MUST be handled by error procedures [Section 
]. 
 
6.3.3 Protocol Error Recovery 
 
This section does not address additional steps that might be taken, such as 
logging and reporting  alarm messages. 
 
The simplest "recovery" mechanism is to terminate the session (clear the call) 
when a protocol error occurs. Another, more complex recovery mechanism is to 
set both sides to the audio media state, which is the "base" , "ground" or 
"reset" state for the SSE protocol state machine. The choice can be 
 
R.Kumar           Informational û Expires August 2002              14 
                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
provisionable. If the two parties in a session are provisioned inconsistently, 
then session recovery SHALL result in session termination. 
 
In the case where recovery consists of consistently resetting the local media 
state  on both sides to audio, it SHALL consist of the following sequence of 
actions: 
 
     1.   Set S = a and S' = i (local media state set to audio, remote media 
          state set to indeterminate). 
     2.   Send an SSE indicating the audio state. This is to be repeated every 
          T1 seconds (defined below) until S'=a.  If S'!=a after N tries, then 
          the session SHALL be terminated.  
 
The following is a list of conditions, not necessarily exhaustive, that SHALL 
trigger this recovery procedure: 
 
     1.   Inability to comply with  the rules of Section . This covers the 
          receipt of out-of-context SSEs, and an inability to make one of the 
          permitted local media state transitions for reasons such as changes 
          in resource status. 
     2.   If S != S' (local and remote media state not the same) for more than 
          T2  seconds (defined below). 
     3.   If the received payload type and/or packet format is inconsistent 
          with the local media state, S1, for more than T2 seconds (defined 
          below). Note that this allows asymmetrical payload types, but not 
          asymmetrical media states. If at all there is such a need, a 
          multimedia session is RECOMMENDED. 
 
The following is a list of timeouts associated with this recovery procedure: 
 
     1.   T1. Repeat interval for audio SSEs used for resetting the SSE 
          protocol. The suggested default is 1 seconds, this MAY be 
          provisionable. This is to be distinguished from normal SSE redundancy 
          (Section ). Note that each the SSE redundancy modes described in 
          Section 4 MAY co-exist with the ones described in this section. The 
          value of N (number of retries) SHALL be defaulted to 5.  
     2.   T2.  Transience  interval for media states. This is the  time 
          interval for which an inconsistency in the local and remote media 
          states is permitted. Theoretically, this can be made equal to the 
          Round Trip Delay for SSEs, plus a margin for processing delays, delay 
          fluctuations etc. In practice, it is not always possible to set this 
          parameter separately for each possible session. A default value that 
          is large enough for all connections MAY be chosen; it is suggested 
          that this be 1 seconds. 
 
 
The timeouts, T1 and T2, and the retry count, N, MAY be provisionable.

SSE cause codes are to be defined per SSE event. Some SSE events MAY have no 
cause codes associated with them. 
 
The definition of SSE cause codes is not complete, and will be included in a 
later version of this internet draft. Examples of this on-going work are the 
draft definitions of MoIP-specific SSE cause codes currently being reviewed  by 
the TIA TR-30.1 and ITU Q11/16 study groups.   
  
 
7 Examples of the use of State Signaling Event Messages 
 
In this set of examples, entity 1, 2, 3 etc. are gateways/endpoints that share 
a VoIP RTP session and that use SSEs to communicate media state changes. 
  
These examples are meant to illustrate the use of State Signaling Event 
Messages in normal and error scenarios. Any reference to local event triggers 
is meant for illustrative purposes only, and it not intended to specify a right 
response to those triggers. This SHOULD be found in application-specific 
documents such as [14].

Figure 3: Examples of successful and failed media state change attempts 
  
In , both ends are in a protocol state (S, S') = (a, a) initially (Section ). 
Entity 2 detects a 2100 Hz ANS tone and sets its local media state, S = v. 
Since the local media state has changed to 'v', entity 2 sends SSE: VBD to 
entity 1. Entity 1 determines that it has the resources to do a media state 
shift to VBD. It sets the local media state to 'v'. It MUST now send SSE : VBD 
to entity 2. At this point, by the rules of Section , entity 2 need not send a 
further SSE: VBD to entity 1.  
 
Subsequently, entity 2 detects a V.21 fax preamble, changes its local media 
state to 'f' and sends SSE: FR to entity 1. Entity 1 determines that it does 
not have the resources to do a media shift to fax relay, and sets the local 
media state to audio. Per the rules of , it could have left it as voiceband 
data. However, this is not how this example progresses. Entity 1 sends an SSE:

                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
audio to entity 2, which sets its media state to audio and responds with SSE: 
audio.   
 
If entity 1 does not receive SSE: audio within T1 seconds, it will resend SSE: 
audio to entity 2, for a total of N retries (Section ).   
  
Note that this document does not mandate a switch to a voiceband data media 
state on detection of a 2100 Hz tone. It merely illustrates the use of SSEs to 
synchronize this and other media state changes. 
 
In addition to the media state change, it is necessary to ensure that the 2100 
Hz tone is transmitted end to end. Other means, used in addition to SSEs,  MUST 
be used to accomplish this. These could be one of the following: RFC 2833 
telephone events, RFC 2833 telephony tones, or in-band transmission via the 
voice codec. 
  
 
8 Justification for State Signaling Events 
 
8.1 A Precedent for In-band State Signaling (AAL2 type 3 packets) 
 
Like RTP sessions, AAL2 channels can be used to carry real-time media. Even 
though the out-of-band signaling method defined in ITU Q.2630.1 can be used to 
effect changes in media properties and states [6], it is supplemented with in-
band signaling that is integrated into the media stream through use of the same 
channel identifier (CID). This signaling scheme uses "type 3" packets to 
signal, reject and accept state changes, and to perform other time-critical 
messaging such as relaying alarm conditions, controlling loopback, and 
synchronizing previously signalled changes in media ("Service-Specific 
Convergence Sublayer") attributes. Because of the dynamic nature of resource 
availability, unsynchronized, autonomous local switching between alternative 
media properties that have been agreed to a priori (via out-of-band signaling) 
is not workable. The type 3 packet-based, explicit, in-band synchronization 
method used does not incur the potential delays inherent in out-of-band 
signaling.  AAL2 state change messages cover the following modes or "user" 
states: voice, voiceband data, circuit emulation and fax demodulation (fax 
relay). Reliable transmission of type 3 messages is ensured via a triple 
redundancy scheme, and CRC-10 protection of individual type 3 packets. 
 
8.2 Comparison of SSEs with other alternatives 
 
In the case of real-time communications over IP, several alternatives have been 
suggested to SSEs for synchronizing media state changes. These were considered 
by the ITU SG16 and found inferior compared to the in-band, SSE signaling 
alternative. These options are: 
 
  1. Unsynchronized, on the fly-media state switches. If the capabilities 
     associated with media states have been advertised at session establishment 
     time, then both ends should be able to switch on the fly between these 
     states. Although this is possible, this requires that both ends tie up the 
     necessary resources to support all advertised capabilities. If they do not 
     do so for the sake of efficiency, then there is a possibility of erroneous

     operation due to resource starvation. This is specially true in large 
     trunk gateways that handle several thousands of concurrent VoIP  sessions, 
     and use dynamic allocation of resources such as bandwidth and DSP power.  
 
  
  2. Use out-of-band signaling (such as a SIP invite, [3]) with a fresh session 
     description each time a media property needs to be changed. In certain 
     configurations, this method has the problem of unacceptable delay due to 
     congestion on common signaling (SIP etc.) ports that handle multiple 
     sessions. Note that in-band SSE signaling cannot supplant out-of-band 
     signaling for changing media properties, which used an integral part of 
     signaling protocols such as SIP, H.248 and H.323. Further, it must be 
     noted that if media properties need to be changed with greater precision 
     that what is afforded by SSEs, out-of-band signaling, which uses a wealth 
     of SDP or  H.245 constructs might be needed. If SSEs are available, then 
     such changes based on out-of-band signaling can be made rare enough so as 
     not burden signaling ports, agents etc.   Since SSEs are bound to a 
     session, they do not suffer the possible congestion and delays associated 
     with common signaling paths. 
 
  3. Extension of the list of rfc2833 Named Telephone Events (NTEs) to include 
     state signaling messages. Members of the IETF AVT study group have found 
     this unacceptable since these RFC 2833 NTEs indicate the detection of 
     stateless, raw stimuli such as tones and preamble bits, which need to be 
     qualified with duration information. Further, it is not desirable to 
     complicate RFC 2833 Named Telephone Event definition with a state 
     transition protocol such as Section . Keeping the MIME media types for the 
     two sets of events separate allows equipment to implement RFC 2833 
     telephone events but not State Signaling Events, or both,  and to indicate 
     the applicable protocol support at session establishment time. Also note 
     that SSEs can never replace RFC 2833 telephone events, which perform the 
     critical task of providing a "compression-friendly" means of transporting 
     tones over an IP session. 
 
  4. Define a new RTCP message for synchronizing media state changes, and 
     parameterize it with specific  media state transitions, precedence values, 
     cause code fields etc. This approach is rejected for the reason that RTCP 
     is, in general, not meant to be an extensible protocol. All RTP-compliant 
     sessions are required to support the full complement of RTCP messages. 
     This is in contrast with the flexible definition of audio MIME types, and 
     the mapping of these MIME types and related parameters into dynamic 
     payload types and SDP attributes. It would be inconsistent with the 
     current state of the protocol to detail RTCP capabilities, with a fine 
     granularity, at the time of session establishment. On the other hand, 
     there is no inconsistency in defining a new audio MIME type for State 
     Signaling Event messages, and to allow receivers to flexibly indicate 
     support for individual messages. Sessions lacking in adequate support for 
     in-band state signaling must, of necessity, fall back to out-of-band 
     signaling for synchronized changes in media state.

9 Proposed MIME Registration  
 
This section provides a MIME registration proposal for State Signaling Events. 
 
 
      MIME media type name: audio 
 
      MIME subtype name: sse 
 
Required parameters: events 
 
The "events" parameter lists the State Signaling   
Events supported by the implementation. Events are 
listed as one or more comma-separated elements. Each element can 
either be a single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen. 
The range of these integers is 0-255. No white space is allowed in the 
argument. The integers designate the State Signaling  Event numbers  
supported by the implementation.  Thus, events="192,194,200-202" indicates  
that the State Signaling  Events supported by the implementation are 192,  
194, 200, 201 and 202.  The "events" parameter is represented in the  Session 
Description Protocol (SDP, RFC 2327) by the "fmtp"  attribute.  
When this is done, its value is represented in a format that is identical in 
format to the "events" MIME parameter. The encoding name used in conjunction 
with this MIME is "sse". Since the "events" parameter is mandatory with the 
MIME audio/sse, there is no default list of events that can be assumed when 
this MIME is supported for a session or connection.   
 
Optional parameters: sseCauseCodeEnable,SSEscope 
 
The "sseCauseCodeEnable" parameter can be assigned a value of "yes" and "no". A 
"yes" value implies that the events listed in the mandatory "events" parameter 
may be supplemented with cause code fields. All standard cause codes for the 
advertised events must be supported.  A "no" value implies the absence of this 
information by setting these SSE fields to a null value. If 
"sseCauseCodeEnable" is omitted, then these fields are set to null. The 
sseCauseCodeEnable boolean may be represented within an SDP "fmtp"  attribute.   
 
The "SSEscope" parameter is a list of ports. These are the ports governed by 
the SSE payload type in question. These may or may not include the port on 
which SSEs are received. If omitted, SSEs MAY only govern the media stream on 
the port to which they are received. 
 
Encoding considerations: 
The  MIME audio/sse is only defined for transfer via the Real Time 
Protocol (RTP) as defined in RFC 1889. As such, it consists of packets 
of binary data.  
 
 
Security considerations:  
 
See the "Security Considerations" (Section ) section in this document.

10 Security Considerations 
 
RTP packets using the payload format used for State Signaling Events 
defined in this specification are subject to the security 
considerations discussed in the RTP specification (RFC 1889) and any 
appropriate RTP profile (for example RFC 1890). This implies that 
confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption. Since 
there is no data compression of State Signaling Events, there is no 
potential conflict between compression and encryption.  
 
This payload type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the 
receiver side computational complexity for packet processing to cause a 
potential denial-of-service threat. Any flooding of a receiver with State 
Signaling Events does not have an impact on unrelated sessions that is 
different from flooding a session with any other payload format (e.g. PCM or 
telephone event). Regardless of the payload type used for the attack, the 
remedy is to limit resource allocation to any and all RTP sessions, to 
authenticate session participants, and to log and penalize disruptive or 
illegal behavior. 
 
The MIME subtype contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a participant. For 
these session legs, changes to media state are well within the normal 
prerogatives of the requester. 
 
The switchover from one media state to another may cause the use of a different 
media port. However, this does not pose a security hazard since this

                       RTP State Signaling Events             February 2002 
 
 
switchover, which may be governed by SSEs, is limited to a set of ports 
assigned, at session establishment, via the media/flow/session description. 
SSEs cannot be used to specify arbitrary port changes. 
  
  
11 IANA Considerations  
 
This document defines one new RTP payload formats, state signaling event, and 
the associated Internet media (MIME) type, audio/sse. The initial assignment of 
possible values to the parameter "events" will be based on the RFC that will 
come out of this internet draft. This document will contain a complete 
description of the non-null cause code field values associated with each event 
in this initial list of  events. It will also describe the  cause code 
information, if any, associated with each cause code. 
 
Within the audio/sse type, additional events MUST be registered with IANA. 
Registrations are subject to approval by the current chair of the IETF 
audio/video transport working group, or by an expert designated by the 
transport area director if the AVT group has closed.   
  
The meaning of new events MUST be documented either as an RFC or an equivalent 
standards document produced by another standardization body, such as ITU-T. The 
description of each new event must be accompanied with a complete description 
of any non-null cause codes and cause code information values associated with 
that event. Additions to the list of cause codes or cause code information 
values will require an amendment to the document defining the event.
