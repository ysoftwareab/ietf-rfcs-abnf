 Deprecation of MIB Module NAT-MIB (Managed Objects for Network Address
                           Translators (NAT))
             draft-perrault-behave-deprecate-nat-mib-v1-01

Abstract

   This memo deprecates MIB module NAT-MIB, a portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) previously defined in RFC 4008 for devices
   implementing Network Address Translator (NAT) function.  A companion
   document defines a new version, NAT-MIB-V2, which responds to
   deficiencies found in module NAT-MIB and adds new capabilities.

   This document obsoletes RFC 4008.

1.  Introduction

   This memo deprecates a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB), MIB module NAT-MIB, for devices implementing the Network
   Address Translator (NAT) function.  New implementations are
   encouraged to base themselves upon the second version of this MIB
   module, NAT-MIB-V2, defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2].  NAT
   types and their characteristics are defined in [RFC2663].
   Traditional NAT function, in particular is defined in [RFC3022].
   Neither NAT-MIB nor NAT-MIB-V2 addresses firewall functions and
   neither can be used for configuring or monitoring them.

   Section 2 provides references to the SNMP management framework, which
   was used as the basis for the original MIB module definition and its
   deprecation.  Section 3 provides motivation for the deprecation of
   module NAT-MIB and its replacement by module NAT-MIB-V2.  Section 4
   has the complete NAT-MIB module definition, with the STATUS of all
   objects changed to deprecated.  Section 5 describes security
   considerations relating to NAT-MIB, basically elaborating on the
   security considerations in [RFC4008].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].

3.  Motivation For Deprecating NAT-MIB

   This section provides the motivation for deprecating the NAT-MIB
   module and its replacement by a new version.

3.1.  Deprecated Features

   All objects defined in [RFC4008] have been marked with "STATUS
   deprecated" for the following reasons:

   Writability:  Experience with NAT has shown that implementations vary
      tremendously.  The NAT algorithms and data structures have little
      in common across devices, and this results in wildly incompatible
      configuration parameters.  Therefore, few implementations were
      ever able to claim full compliance.

      Lesson learned: the MIB should be read-only as much as possible.

   Exposing configuration parameters:  Even in read-only mode, many
      configuration parameters were exposed by [RFC4008] (e.g.
      timeouts).  Since implementations vary wildly in their sets of
      configuration parameters, few implementations could claim even
      basic compliance.

      Lesson learned: the NAT MIB's purpose is not to expose
      configuration parameters.

   Interfaces:  Objects from [RFC4008] tie NAT state with interfaces
      (e.g. the interface table, the way map entries are grouped by
      interface).  Many NAT implementations either never keep track of
      the interface or associate a mapping to a set of interfaces.

Internet-Draft          Deprecation of NAT MIB v1           January 2015


      Since interfaces are at the core of [RFC4008], many NAT devices
      were unable to have a proper implementation.

      Lesson learned: NAT is a logical function that may be independent
      of interfaces.  Do not tie NAT state with interfaces.

   NAT service types:  [RFC4008] used four categories of NAT service:
      basicNat, napt, bidirectionalNat, twiceNat.  These are ill-defined
      and many implementations either use different categories or do not
      use categories at all.

      Lesson learned: do not try to categorize NAT types.

   Limited transport protocol set:  The set of transport protocols was
      defined as: other, icmp, udp, tcp.  Furthermore, the numeric
      values corresponding to those labels were arbitrary, without
      relation to the actual standard protocol numbers.  This meant that
      NAT implementations were limited to those protocols and were
      unable to expose information about DCCP, SCTP, etc.

      Lesson learned: use standard transport protocol numbers.

3.2.  Desirable New Features

   A number of desirable new features have been identified that are not
   present in NAT-MIB.  See the latter part of
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib-v2] Section 2.

4.  Definitions

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and
   [RFC4001].

                Session direction (inbound or outbound) is

                Traditionally, address maps for Basic NAT and NAPT are

                value for this object for the map entries
                would be inboundSrcEndPoint (i.e., effecting translation
                of source end-point for inbound sessions).

5.  Security Considerations

   The threats that need to be addressed are described in Section 1.4 of
   [RFC3411].  They include modification of information, masquerade,
   message stream modification and disclosure.  No protection is needed
   against denial of service and traffic analysis.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Timers:  An attacker setting very low timer values can easily cause a
      denial-of-service situation.  NAT-MIB has the following read-write
      timers:

      *  natBindDefIdleTimeout

      *  natUdpDefIdleTimeout

      *  natIcmpDefIdleTimeout

      *  natOtherDefIdleTimeout

      *  natTcpDefIdleTimeout

      *  natTcpDefNegTimeout

   Notification throttling:  An attacker setting a very low throttling
      interval can cause many useless notifications to be generated.
      Disabling notifications could be used to hide another attack.
      Notification throttling is controlled by the object
      natNotifThrottlingInterval.

   Other configuration:  The following tables provide write access, at
      least in part:

      *  Rows of the natInterfaceTable are read-create, and the columnar
         objects indicating realm and service type are read-write.  An
         attacker could deny service by modifying interface
         configuration, for instance by changing the realm from public
         to private where the interface is actually on the public side
         of the NAT.

      *  Similarly (to support static mapping), rows of the
         natAddrMapTable are read-create and thus potentially modifiable
         by an attacker.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Objects that reveal host identities:  Various objects can reveal the
      identity of private hosts that are engaged in a session with
      external end nodes.  A curious outsider could monitor these to
      assess the number of private hosts being supported by the NAT
      device.  The outsider could use the information to break into
      specific private hosts by intercepting the existing sessions or
      originating new sessions into the host.  This applies to the
      address and port related objects within the following tables:

      *  natAddrMapTable

      *  natAddrBindTable

      *  natAddrPortBindTable

      *  natSessionTable

   Other objects that reveal NAT state:  Other managed objects in this
      MIB may contain information that may be sensitive from a business
      perspective, in that they may represent NAT state information.
      This applies to the following counters:

      *  natAddrBindNumberOfEntries

      *  natAddrPortBindNumberOfEntries

      *  natInterfaceTable: natInterfaceInTranslates,
         natInterfaceOutTranslates, and natInterfaceDiscards

      *  natAddrMapTable: natAddrMapInTranslates,
         natAddrMapOutTranslates, natAddrMapDiscards, and
         natAddrMapAddrUsed

      *  natAddrBindTable: natAddrBindSessions, natAddrBindInTranslates,
         natAddrBindOutTranslates

      *  natAddrPortBindTable: natAddrPortBindSessions,
         natAddrPortBindInTranslates, natAddrPortBindOutTranslates

      *  natSessionTable: natSessionInTranslates,
         natSessionOutTranslates

      *  natProtocolTable: natProtocolInTranslates,
         natProtocolOutTranslates, natProtocolDiscards

   There are no objects that are sensitive in their own right, such as
   passwords or monetary amounts.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for

   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned object identifier 123 to the natMIB module, with
   prefix iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2 in the Network Management
   Parameters registry [SMI-NUMBERS].

   No IANA actions are required by this document.
