INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Terminology for     October 2006
                            SIP Networking Devices

ABSTRACT
This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP 
performance in networking devices.  Terms are included for test 
components, test setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics 
for black-box benchmarking of SIP networking devices.  The 
Performance Benchmark Metrics are obtained for the SIP Control Plane 
and Media Plane.  The terms are intedned for use in a companion 
Methodology document for complete performance characterization of a 
device in a variety of network conditions making it possible to 
compare performance of different devices. It is critical to provide 
Test Setup Parameters and a Methodology document for SIP performance 
benchmarking because SIP allows a wide range of configuration and 
operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark 
measurements.  It is necessary to have terminology and methodology
standards to ensure that reported benchmarks have consistent 
definition and were obtained following the same procedures.
Benchmarks can be applied to compare performance of a variety 
of SIP networking devices.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Terminology for       October 2006
                            SIP Networking Devices

1. Introduction
Service Providers are now planning Voice Over IP (VoIP) and Multimedia 
network deployments using the IETF developed Session Initiation Protocol 
(SIP) [Ro02].  VoIP has led to development of new networking devices 
including SIP Server, Session Border Controller, and SIP-Aware Stateful 
Firewall.  The mix of voice and IP functions in this variety of devices 
has produced inconsistencies in vendor reported performance metrics and 
has caused confusion in the service provider community. SIP allows a 
wide range of configuration and operational conditions that can 
influence performance benchmark measurements.  It is important to be 
able to correlate a signalling measurement with the media plane 
measurements to determine the system performance.  

When defining SIP performance benchmarks it is critical to also provide 
definitions for Test Setup Parameters and a corresponding Methodology 
document for SIP performance benchmarking.  This enables benchmarks to 
be understood, fairly compared, and repeatable.  This document provides 
the benchmarking terms for performance benchmarking the SIP control 
and media planes.  Terms are included for Test Components, Test Setup 
Parameters, and Benchmarks.  All benchmarks are black-box measurements 
of the SIP Control and Media Planes.  It is intended that these terms 
be used in a companion Methodology document.  

SIP is used to create a growing number of very different applications 
and features.  The set of benchmarking terms provided in this document 
is intended for application to each.  SIP is frequently used to 
create streams of media.  The control plane and the media plane are 
treated as orthogonal in this document.  In order to characterize the 
performance of one or another application or feature it may be 
necessary to logically associate several of the benchmarking metrics 
provided here.  Benchmarks to be obtained and compared for different 
types of Devices Under test (DUTs) such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, 
P-CSCF, Proxy Server paired with a Firewall/NAT device, and P-CSCF 
paired with a Firewall/NAT device.  Media benchmarks can also be made 
when testing Systems Under Test (SUTs).     

2.  Existing definitions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119.  
   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.  The term Throughput is defined in RFC 2544.

   Many SIP terms used in this document are defined in [Ro02].

3. Term Definitions

   3.1 Test Components
       3.1.1 SIP Control Plane

           Definition:
           The logical plane in which SIP Signaling messages are 
           exchanged between SIP Agents.
           
           Discussion:
           SIP signaling messages are used to establish SIP signaling 
           sessions in several ways: directly between two User Agents; 
           between a User Agent and a Proxy Server; or between a 
           series of Proxy Servers.
           
           Measurement Units:

           Emulated Agents

        3.1.2 SIP Media Plane

           Definition:
           The logical plane in which media streams, also known as
           the "payload" or "bearer channel", established by the 
           SIP Signaling messages are exchanged. 
          
           Discussion:
           The Media Plane is analagous to the Data Plane.
           Packets for the SIP Control Plane and the SIP Media Plane 
           traverse different paths, which can produce variation
           in performance.  For this reason it is necessary to 
           benchmark performance of the SIP Control Plane and the 
           SIP Media Plane.

        3.1.3 Emulated Agent

           Definition:
           Device in test topology that initates/responds to SIP 
           signaling as a session endpoint and sources/receives 
           associated media for established connections.  

           Discussion:
           The Emulated Agent (EA) is a function of the Tester.     
           The Tester MAY be configured to be multiple EAs.
 
           Measurement Units:
           N/A

        3.1.4 Session Server

           Definition:
           Device in test topology that acts as proxy between Emulated
           Agents.  This device is either a DUT or component of a SUT. 

           Discussion:
           The Session Server MUST be a RFC 3261 [Ro02] compliant 
           device.  It MAY be a Proxy Server, Session Border Controller 
           (SBC), or other type of device that is RFC 3261 compliant.  
           
           Measurement Units:  N/A

        3.1.5 SIP-Aware Stateful Firewall

           Definition:
           Device in test topology that provides SIP DoS Protection 
           for the Emulated Agents and Session Server
 
           Discussion:
           The SIP-Aware Stateful Firewall MAY be an internal 
           component or function of the Session Server.  The 
           SIP-Aware Stateful Firewall MAY be a standalone device 
           that MUST be pairedwith a Session Server to be benchmarked 
           as a SUT. SIP-Aware Stateful Firewalls MAY include 
           Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality.  
           Additional functionality MAY NOT be supported.

        3.1.6 Invite-Initiated Control Session (IICS)

           Definition:  
           A SIP signaling exchange that includes an initial SIP INVITE 
           message exchanged between Emulated Agent and DUT/SUT.

           Discussion:

           An Invite-Initiated Control Session (IICS) MAY have 
           associated media.  The inclusion of media is test case 
           dependent. An IICS may be in one of several different 
           states:  Attempting , Established, Disconnecting. These 
           states are distinguished as follows:  

           Attempting - the state after the invite is sent by or 
           received at the Tester and before the ack to that Invite 
           is received at or sent by the Tester. This definition 
           includes possible reinvites as well as redirects. It also 
           includes all Invites that are rejected for lack of 
           authentication information.

           Established - the state after the 200 OK for the initiating 
           Invite is sent by or received at the Tester. This definition 
           includes possible reinvites as well as redirects.  It also 
           includes all invites that are rejected for lack of 
           authentication information.

           Disconnecting - the state after a BYE is sent by or received 
           at the Tester.

       3.1.7 Non-INVITE-initiated Control Session (NIICS)

           Definition:  
           A SIP signaling exchange that does not include an initial SIP 
           INVITE message exchanged between Emulated Agent and DUT/SUT.

           Discussion:
           A Non-INVITE-initiated Control Session (N-IICS) does not have 
           Associated media. 

           Measurement Units:
           N/A

       3.1.8 Registration

           Definition:  
           A NIICS whose initial SIP message is a REGISTER request.

           Discussion:
           Registrations represent a percent of SIP network traffic.  
           As such they represent a significant part of the work of 
           some elements of the DUT/SUT.  A Registration attempt
           MAY be sussessful or unsuccessful.  A suuccessful 
           registration is determined by receipt of a 200 OK 
           response.  An unsuccessful registration is one that
           does not receive a 200 OK response.

           Measurement Units:
           N/A

       3.1.9 Associated Media Stream 

           Definition:  
           A media stream that is associated with an IICS.

           Discussion:
           Any media protocol MAY be used.  If RTP is used, the 
           Associated Media Stream of the IICS is identified as 
           the concatenation of 
           (1) the IP address and transport port identified by the 
               originator in its SDP.
           (2) the IP address and transport port identified by the 
               destination in its SDP. 
           (3) the SSRC in the RTP sent by the originator.
           (4) the SSRC in the RTP sent by the destination.
           (5) the RTCP ports identified by the originator and 
               destination.

           Definition:  
           The collection of associated media streams created by 
           an IICS and identified by a SIP Call-ID.

           Discussion:
           A session, as defined by SDP, can comprise one or more media 
           streams.  
         
           Measurement Units:
           NA

    3.2 Test Setup Parameters

       3.2.1 SIP Transport Protocol 

           Definition:
           The protocol used for transport of the SIP Control Plane 
           messages.           

           Discussion:
           Performance benchmarks may vary for the same SIP networking 
           device depending upon whether TCP, UDP, TLS, SCTP, or another 
           transport layer protocol is used.  For this reason it MAY
           be necessary to measure the SIP Performance Benchmarks using 
           these various transport protocols.  Performance Benchmarks 
           MUST report the SIP Transport Protocol used to obtain the 
           benchmark results.

           Definition:
           Configuration on the Emulated Agent for time from an IICS 
           establishment to BYE.  This is the duration of the 
           Established State.
           
           Discussion:
           The Intended Session Duration is configured on the Emulated 
           Agent. This value is used for all sessions.  When 
           benchmarking Session Capacity the effective value of the

           establishment to BYE.

           Discussion:
           The value of the Measured Session Duration MAY not equal
           the Intended Session Duration.  This parameter requires 
           that the session duration be measured for every session 
           through the test duration.

        3.2.4 Session Attempt Rate

           Definition:
           Configuration on the Emulated Agent for number of 
           sessions to be established at the DUT per continuous 
           one-second intervals.

           Discussion:
           The Session Attempt Rate can cause variation in 
           performance benchmark measurements.  Since this is 
           the number of sessions configured on the Tester, some 
           sessions may not be successfully established on the 
           DUT.  Sessions may be IICS or NIICS.

           For a fixed value of Session Attempt Rate, more stress 
           may be incurred on the DUT/SUT when it processes 
           sessions setups and teardowns concurrently during each 
           one-second interval.
         
           Measurement Units:
           session attempts per second (saps)

           Configuration on the Emulated Agent for number of 
           media sessions to be established at the DUT per 
           continuous one-second intervals.

           Discussion:
           The Media Session Attempt Rate can cause variation in 
           performance benchmark measurements.  Since this is 
           the number of sessions configured on the Tester, some 
           sessions may not be successfully established on the 
           DUT.  Media Sessions MUST be associated to IICSes.

        3.2.4.2 NIICS Attempt Rate

           Definition:
           Configuration on the Emulated Agent for number of 
           NIICSes to be established at the DUT per continuous 
           one-second intervals.

           Discussion:
           The NIICS attempts include registrations, Instant Messages, 
           and Presence-related messages.

           Definition:
           Configuration on the Emulated Agent for a fixed number 
           of media streams offered for each session.

           Discussion:
           For a single benchmark test, all sessions use the 
           same number of Media Streams per Session.  Presence 
           of media streams and the number of media streams per 
           session can cause variation in performance benchmark 
           measurements.  The RECOMMENDED values for Media 
           Streams per Session are 0,1,2,3,4, but higher values 
           MAY be used.
         
           Measurement Units:

           packets used for media streams.

           Discussion:
           For a single benchmark test, all sessions use the

           Definition:
           The maximum number of SIP sessions that the DUT/SUT 
           can simultaneously have established.

           Discussion:
           The Session Duration MUST be infinite so that sessions
           remain established for the duration of the test to 
           obtain the Session Capacity benchmark.  The Session 
           Capacity must be reported with the Session Rate used to 
           reach the maximum.  Since Session Rate is a zero-loss 
           measurement, there must be zero failures to achieve the 
           Session Capacity.  Sessions may be IICS or NIICS.

           for the duration of a benchmarking test.
           
           Discussion:
           Session Establishment Performance is a benchmark to indicate 
           session establishment success for the duration of a test.  
           The duration for measuring this benchmark is to be specified 
           in the Methodology.  The Session Duration may be configured 
           so that sessions terminate during the test duration.  
           Established Sessions MAY be reported as the percentage of 
           Session Attempts that failed or the percentage of Session 
           Attempts that were successful.

        3.3.5 Session Setup Delay 

           Definition:
           The average time for a session to establish.
 
           Discussion:
           Time is from the Emulated Agent to signal the first 
           INVITE.  Session Setup Delay MUST be measured for 
           every established session to calculate the average.

        3.3.7 Standing Sessions

           Definition:  
           Measurement of the number of Active Control Sessions 
           concurrently established on the DUT/SUT at an instant.

           Discussion:
           The number of Standing Sessions is influenced by 
           the Session Duration and the Session Rate (or 
           Session Attempt Rate).  Benchmarks MUST be reported 
           with the maximum and average Standing Sessions for 
           the DUT/SUT.  In order to determine the maximum and 
           average Standing Sessions on the DUT/SUT for the 
           duration of the test it is necessary to make 
           periodic measurements of the number of Standing 
           Sessions on the DUT/SUT.  The recommended value 
           for the measurement period is 1 second.

    3.3.8 IM Rate

    Definition: 
    Maximum number of IM messages completed successfully 
    by the DUT/SUT.

    Discussion: 
    For a UAS, the definition of success is
    the receipt of an IM request and the subsequent sending
    of a final response.  For a UAC, the definition of success
    is the sending of an IM request and the receipt of
    a final response to it.  For a proxy, the definition of
    success is as follows:
      a) the number of IM requests it receives from the upstream
      client MUST be equal to the number of IM requests it
      sent to the downstream server; and
      b) the number of IM responses it receives from the
      downstream server MUST be equal to the number of IM
      requests sent to the downstream server; and
      c) the number of IM responses it sends to the upstream
      client MUST be equal to the number of IM requests it
      received from the upstream client.

    Measurement Units:
    IM Messages Per Second

    Issues:
    None.

    3.3.9 Presence Rate

    Definition: 
    Maximum number of presence notifications sent out by 
    the DUT/SUR acting as a Presence Agent [Ro04].

    Discussion: The intent of this benchmark is to assess the
    throughput of a Presence Agent (PA, see [Ro04]).  The
    PA will accept subscriptions from watchers, and when the
    target of the subscription is registered with the PA (who
    is acting as a registrar), a notification is generated to
    the watcher.  This benchmark will use the presence event
    package as documented in [Ro04].  The Presence Rate will 
    be less than or equal to the Registration Rate.

    Measurement Units:
    Presence Notifications Per Second

    See Also:
    Registration Rate.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

5. Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not 
   performed on devices or systems connected to production
   networks.  Security threats and how to counter these in SIP 
   and the media layer is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and 
   RFC3711 and various other drafts.  This document attempts to
   formalize a set of common terminology for benchmarking SIP
   networks.
