1.  Introduction

   Local/Remote Interface Identifiers are flooded by OSPF [RFC2328] as
   defined in [RFC4203].  From the perspective of the advertising
   router, the Local Interface Identifier is a known value, however the
   Remote Interface Identifier needs to be learnt before it can be
   advertised.  [RFC4203] suggests to use TE Link Local LSA [RFC3630] to
   communicate Local Interface Identifier to neighbors on the link.
   Though such mechanism works, it has some drawbacks.

   This draft proposes an extension to OSPF link-local signaling (LLS)
   [RFC5613] to advertise the Local Interface Identifier.

2.  Interface ID Exchange using TE Opaque LSA

   Usage of the Link Local TE Opaque LSA to propagate the Local
   Interface Identifier to the neighbors on the link is described in
   [RFC4203].  This mechanism has following problems:

      LSAs can only be flooded over an existing adjacency that is in
      Exchange state or greater.  The adjacency state machine progresses
      independently on each side of the adjacency and, as such, may
      reach the Full state on one side before the TE Link Opaque LSA
      arrives.  The consequence is that link can be initially advertised
      without the Remote Interface Identifier.  Later when the TE Link
      Opaque LSA arrives, the link must be advertised again, this time
      with the valid Remote Interface Identifier.  Implementation may

      choose to wait before advertising the link, but there is no
      guarantee that the neighbor will ever advertise the TE Link Opaque
      LSA with the Interface Identifier.  In summary, the existing
      mechanism does not guarantee that Remote Interface Identifier is
      known at the time the link is advertised.

      TE Opaque LSA is defined for MPLS Traffic Engineering, but the
      knowledge of the Remote Interface Identifier is useful for other
      cases where MPLS TE is not used.  One example is the lack of valid
      2-way connectivity check for remote parallel point-to-point links
      in OSPF.  In such case, TE Opaque LSAs are not exchanged solely
      for 2-way connectivity correctness.

3.  Interface ID Exchange using OSPF LLS

   To address the problems described earlier and to allow the Interface
   Identifiers exchange to be part of the neighbor discovery process, we
   propose to extend OSPF link-local signaling to advertise the Local
   Interface Identifier in OSPF and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] Hello and Database
   Description packets.

3.1.  Local Interface Identifier TLV

   The Local Interface Identifier TLV is a new LLS TLV.  It has
   following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                   Local Interface Identifier                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

      Type: TBD, suggested value 18

      Length: 4 octet

      Local Interface Identifier: The value of the local Interface
      Identifier.

   If the Local Interface ID is advertised in both OSPF LLS and in Link
   Local TE Opaque LSA, the value of the Local Interface ID MUST be the
   same in both advertisements.  If different values are advertised in
   OSPF LLS and in Link Local TE Opaque LSA, then the receiver SHOULD

   ignore both values and treat it as if the Local Interface ID was not
   advertised at all.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates Link Local Signalling TLV Identifiers
   registry.

   Following values is allocated:

   o 18 - Local Interface Identifier TLV

5.  Security Considerations

   Implementations must assure that malformed LLS TLV and Sub-TLV
   permutations do not result in errors which cause hard OSPF failures.
