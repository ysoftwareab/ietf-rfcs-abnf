Abstract

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute indicates an IPv6 prefix that is
   to be delegated to the user.

1.  Introduction

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix indicates an IPv6 prefix to be delegated to
   the user.  For example, the prefix in a Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
   attribute can be delegated to another node through DHCP Prefix

   Delegation [2].  This is different from the usage of Framed-IPv6-
   Prefix attribute in which the prefix remains in control of the
   Network Access Server (NAS).  The prefix in the Framed-IPv6-Prefix
   attribute can be assigned to a link to which the NAS is attached, and
   may subsequently be advertised through Router Advertisement messages
   [3].

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MAY be used in Access-Accept packets, and
   can appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an Access-Request
   packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would prefer these
   prefix(es), but the server is not required to honor the hint.

2.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

3.  Attribute format

   The format of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |  Reserved     | Prefix-Length |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


       Type

            TBD for Delegated-IPv6-Prefix

       Length

            At least 4 and no larger than 20

       Reserved

            Always set to zero

       Prefix-Length

            The length of the prefix, in bits.  At least 0 and no larger
            than 128

   Note that the prefix field is only required to be long enough to hold
   the prefix bits and can be shorter than 16 bytes.  Any bits in the
   prefix field that are not part of the prefix MUST be zero.

   The definition of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute is based on the
   Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute.

   The following table describes which messages the Delegated-IPv6-
   Prefix attribute can appear in and in what quantity.

   Request Accept Challenge Reject Accounting  #   Attribute
                                   Request
   0+      0+     0         0      0+          TBD Delegated-IPv6-Prefix

   In this table 0 indicates that an attribute MUST NOT be present in
   the packet and 0+ means that zero or more instances of this attribute
   MAY be present in packet.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a Type value, TBD, for this attribute
   from the RADIUS Types registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed
   in RFC 2607 [5], RFC 2865 [6] and RFC 2869 [7].  Use of IP SEC [8]
   for providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in
   RFC 3162 [1].
