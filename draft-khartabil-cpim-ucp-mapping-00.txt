Abstract 
 
   Messaging is the fastest growing means of communication in the 
   world. Mobile telephony and SMS have also been growing at an 
   enormous rate, eventually bound to edge out traditional telephony 
   systems in volumes and importance. 
    
   Presence and Instant Messaging have become the cornerstones of 
   modern communication. Mobile Presence integrates the concepts of 
   presence over fixed and wireless networks for a wide variety of 
   terminals. 
    
   This memo introduces protocol mapping between CPIM [1], an IETF 
   presence and messaging protocol, and UCP [2], an SMS protocol. This 
   brings the Presence and Instant Messaging service to the mobile 
   user.

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
1.0 Introduction 
 
   Until today, presence updates can only be done through accessing a 
   PC or a PDA. The problem arises when a person needs to update 
   his/her presence information whilst they are in a public place, on a 
   street or any other place where there is no access to a PC. Also, 
   PDA are very expensive and are very scarce in the market today.  The 
   average user on the street needing to update the presence 
   information does not have means of doing so. 
    
   This memo introduces protocol mapping between CPIM [1], an IETF 
   presence and messaging protocol, and UCP [2], an SMS protocol, 
   through some Gateway. This brings the Presence and Instant Messaging 
   service to the mobile user. 
    
   CPIM complaint client users want to send IMÆs to Mobile phones (GSM 
   numbers) and the Mobile users need to be able to send replies back 
   to the CPIM complaint client user by pushing just the REPLY button 
   in their mobile phone. Therefore the IMs (SMSs) need to be sent 
   between two legitimate GSM numbers.

         h: From: Hisham Khartabil <im:hisham.khartabil@hosip.com>  
         h: To: Anas Naim <im:anas.naim@hotsip.com>  
         h: Date: 2001-12-13T13:40:00-08:00 
         s: 
         e: Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 
         e: Content-ID: 1234567890@hotsip.com 
         e: 
         e: Here is the text of my message. 
    
   The relevant parts from the CPIM message are the From-header, To-
   header and the Message-content. 
    
   The following UCP message example shows the result of the mapping 
   from the above CPIM message: 
    
   stx37/00138/O/51/358400067890/358400012345/////////////////3//41202D
   2D48657265206973207468652074657874206F66206D79206D6573736167652E////
   /////////7Eetx 
    
   More generic: 
   stxTRN/00138/O/51/ADC/OADC/////////////////3//AMsg/////////////7Eetx 
    
3.1 From-header mapping 
    
   There are two options here: 
    
   An ENUM [3] lookup is performed on the URL in the from-header. This 
   lookup returns a phone number that is to be used.  This phone number 
   is stored in the UCP's OADC header. 
    
   The second option is assigning a temporary number to the UCP OADC, 
   this helps the gateway map any replies by the recipient to the 
   original message. 
    
3.2 To-header mapping 
    
   An ENUM [3] lookup is performed on the URL in the to-header. This 
   lookup returns a phone number that is to be used.  This phone number 
   is stored in the UCP's ADC header. 
    
   If a phone number is alreadyin the user-name portion of the im URL, 
   this number can be used as the ADC number. 
    
3.3 Message-content mapping 
    
   The CPIM Message-content is encoded according to [2] then copied 
   directly into the UCP's AMsg header if the CPIM Message-content 
   length is smaller than 160 characters. 
    
   When the CPIM message Message-content is greater than 160 
   characters, there needs to be multiple UCP messages sent out. This 
   is due to the limitations of the GSM SMS.  
    
 
Khartabil                                                     [Page 3] 

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
   The multiple UCP messages will have the same OADC and ADC, but the 
   TRN value would increment for every message with the different 
   Message-content. For example, if a message with content-length 430 
   is being sent from: Hisham Khartabil 
   <im:hisham.khartabil@hotsip.com> to: anas naim 
   <im:anas.khartabil@hotsip.com> who is on a GSM phone connected to a 
   UCP enabled SMSC, then that message needs to be mapped to a UCP 
   message(s). The first 160 characters will be in the first mapped UCP 
   message with an OADC value of Hisham's GSM number, ADC value of 
   Anas's GSM number. The TRN value of, say, 37 is assigned. The second 
   mapped UCP message will have the same OADC and ADC values of the 
   first message, with the message content from 161 to 320. The TRN 
   value will be 38. The final mapped UCP message will have the same 
   OADC and ADC values with the last characters 321 to 430 with a TRN 
   value of 39. 
    
4.0 UCP-side Originated Instant Message (SMS) 
    
4.1 OADC mapping 
    
   The UCP OADC field will be in the form of a mobile phone number. 
   This is made into a CPIM To-header by: 
    
   - Either attaching the host name at the end of the number, and by 
   adding the string ôim:ö in front of the number, or 
   - Performing an ENUM lookup on the number and retrieving the im 
   address of the intended recipient. 
    
4.2 ADC mapping 
    
   The UCP ADC field will be in the form of a mobile phone number. This 
   is made into a CPIM To-header by: 
    
   - Either attaching the host name at the end of the number, and by 
   adding the string ôim:ö in front of the number, or 
   - Performing an ENUM lookup on the number and retrieving the im 
   address of the intended recipient. 
    
4.3 AMsg mapping 
    
   The message content of the UCP message stored in the AMsg field is 
   converted into ASCII, UTF-8 or any other desired character set. It 
   is then copied into the CMIP message-content field. 
    
5.0 CPIM-Side Originated NOTIFY 
    
   The from-header and to-header mapping are exactly as defined in 
   section 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. This section will only talk about 
   the message-content mapping. 
    
   According to [5], a CPIM NOTIFY looks like this: 
    
         m: Content-type: Message/CPIM 
         s:

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
         h: From: Anas Naim <im:anas.naim@hotsip.com> 
         h: To: Hisham Khartabil <im:hisham.khartabil@hosip.com>  
         h: Date: 2001-12-13T13:40:00-08:00 
         s: 
         e: Content-type: application/cpim-pidf+xml 
         e: Content-ID: 1234567890@hotsip.com 
         e: Content-Length: .. . 
    
          <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:"> 
            <presentity id="pres:anas.naim@hotsip.com"> 
            <tuple id="mobile-phone"> 
              <status> 
                <value>open</value> 
              </status> 
              <contact priority="9">tel:09012345678</contact> 
              <note>Call me please!</note> 
            </tuple> 
          </presence> 
    
   AMsg is build from 3 components of the pidf mime body: presentity 
   id, value and note. 
    
   The final SMS could look like: "anas.naim@hotsip.com (open, Call me 
   please!)" 
    
   Or to save some SMS characters, you could represent is as follows: 
   "anas naim (+, Call me please!)". 
    
6.0 UCP-Side Originated NOTIFY 
    
   The OADC and ADC mapping are exactly as defined in section 4.1 and 
   4.2 respectively. This section will only talk about the AMsg 
   mapping. 
    
   The AMg could look like "hisham.khartabil@hotsip.com (closed, 
   sleeping)" or "Hisham (-, sleeping)" 
    
   Building this is easy: 
   - tuple id is mobile-phone 
   - presentity id is found like the from-header (by ENUM lookup), or 
   by just copying the from-header 
   - value is closed (the - signed means closed) 
   - contact is the originator's mobile phone number as a tel-url 
   - note is also copied from the SMS itself. 
    
   The final presence document would look like: 
    
          <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:"> 
            <presentity id="pres:hisham.khartabil@hotsip.com"> 
            <tuple id="mobile-phone"> 
              <status> 
                <value>closed</value> 
              </status> 
              <contact priority="9">tel:0407654321</contact>
