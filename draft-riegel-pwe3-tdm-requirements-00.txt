Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


1. Introduction

   This document specifies the particular requirements for edge-to-edge-
   emulation of circuits carrying time division multiplexed (TDM)
   digital signals over packet-switched networks.  It is based on the
   common framework of PWE3 as defined in [PWE3-FW] and the
   considerations on protocol layering in PWE3 as discussed in [PWE3-
   LAYERS].
   It makes references to requirements in [PWE3-REQ] where applicable
   and complements [PWE3-REQ] by defining additional requirements
   originating from specifics of TDM circuits.

   Circuits carrying TDM signals have been defined in such normative
   documents as [G.703], [G.704] and [T.107].

   To support TDM traffic, which includes voice, data, and private
   leased line service, the network must emulate the circuit
   characteristics of a TDM network.

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


2. Motivation

   [PWE3-REQ] specifies common requirements for edge-to-edge-emulation
   of circuits of various types.  However, these requirements, as well
   as references in [PWE3-FW] and [PWE3-LAYERS] do not fully cover all
   specifics of PWs carrying TDM circuits.

   The need for a specific document complementing [PWE3-REQ] with regard
   to edge-to-edge-emulation of TDM circuits arises from following
   causes:

   o  Specifics of the TDM circuits,
      e.g.:

      *  the need for balance between the clock of ingress and egress
         end services in each direction of the PW,

      *  the need to maintain jitter and wander of the clock of the
         egress end service within the limits imposed by the appropriate
         normative documents in spite of the packet delay variation
         produced by the PSN.

   o  Specifics of applications using (native and emulated) TDM
      circuits,
      e.g.  voice applications:

      *  put special emphasis on minimization of one-way delay,

      *  are relatively tolerant to errors in data.

      Other applications might have different specifics.

   o  Specifics of the customers' expectations regarding end-to-end
      behavior of services that contain emulated TDM circuits,
      e.g., experience with carrying such services over SONET/SDH
      networks increases the need for:

      *  isolation of problems introduced by the PSN from those
         occurring beyond the PSN bounds,

      *  higher sensitivity to misconnection, etc.

   It is our intention that this document will be used in the PWE3
   community discussions regarding specific proposals for edge-to-edge-
   emulation of TDM circuits.

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


3. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms defined in [PWE3-FW], Section 1.4 are consistently used,
   usually without additional explanations.  However:

   CE-bound, PSN-bound
      These terms are consistently used instead of 'outbound' and
      'inbound' when describing traffic directions.  These terms have
      been adopted in [PWE3-LAYERS].

   Interworking function (IWF)
      This term is often used for describing the protocol operation with
      explicit references to CE-bound or PSN-bound direction of the IWF.

   Some terms and acronyms are commonly used in conjunction with the TDM
   services.  In particular:

   Channel-Associated Signaling (CAS)
      It is one of several signaling techniques used by the telephony
      applications to convey various states of these applications (e.g.,
      off-hook and on-hook).  CAS uses a certain, circuit-specific
      multiframe structure that is imposed on the TDM bit stream and a
      predefined association between the relative timeslot (= channel)
      number within this stream and position of certain bits within this
      multiframe structure.  In the case of E1 there are four 500 bit/s
      channels for each timeslot used to distinguish and signal
      application states (see [G.704] for details).
      CAS is also used in conjunction with D4 and ESF formats of T1
      using "robbed bits".  In case of D4 this results in 2 channels of
      333.(3) bit/s, and in case of ESF - 4 such channels.
      [## Ed-note##: more details to be included here?]

   Common Channel Signaling (CCS)
      This is an alternative to the CAS method of signaling used by the
      telephony applications.  E.g., for SS7 Common Channel Signaling is
      described in [Q.700] and references therein.
      [## Ed-note##: more to be included here?]

   For the TDM network we use the terms "jitter" and "wander" as defined
   in [G.823] and [G.824], while for the PSN measures from IETF IPPM
   (like packet delay variation - see [IPPM-IPDV]) are used.

4. Reference Models

4.1 Generic PWE3 Models

   Generic models that have been defined in [PWE3-FW] in Sections
   - 3.1 (Network Reference Model),
   - 3.2 (Maintenance Reference Model),
   - 3.4 (Protocol Stack Reference Model) and
   - 3.5 (Logical Protocol Layering Model).
   They are fully applicable for the purposes of this document without
   any modifications.

   All the services considered in this document represent special cases
   of the generic circuit-oriented payload type defined in Section
   3.5.2.1 of [PWE3-FW].

4.2 Network Synchronization Reference Model

   The network synchronization reference model shown in Figure 1 below
   is copied, with some modifications, from one of the expired versions
   of [PWE3-FW]:

   "==>"
      TDM end service circuits

   "::>"
      PW providing edge-to-edge-emulation for the TDM circuit.

   The characters "A" - "L" are denoting various clocks:

   "A"
      The clock used by CE1 for transmission of the TDM end circuit
      towards CE1.

   "B"
      The clock recovered by PE1 from the incoming TDM end circuit.  "A"
      and "B" always have the same frequency.

   "G", "H"
      The same as "A" and "B" respectively for CE2 and PE2 ("G" and "H"
      have the same frequency).

   "C", "D"
      Local oscillators available to PE1 and PE2 respectively.

   "E"
      Clock used by PE2 to transmit the TDM end service circuit to CE2
      (the recovered clock).

   "F"
      Clock recovered by CE2 from the incoming TDM end service ("E and
      "F" have the same frequency).

   "I"
      If it exists, it is the common network reference clock available
      to PE1 and PE2.

   "J", "K"
      The same as "E" and "F" respectively for PE1 and CE1 ("J" and "K"
      have the same frequency).

   "L"
      If it exists, it is the common reference clock of CE1 and CE2.
      Note that different pairs of CE devices may use different common
      reference clocks.

   One of the objectives of edge-to-edge-emulation of a TDM circuit is
   balance between clocks "B" and "E" (i.e., these clocks MUST have the
   same frequency).  This objective may be achieved by different means
   depending on the actual network synchronization scheme deployed.

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


   The following groups of the network synchronization deployment
   scenarios can be considered:

4.2.1 Synchronous Network scenarios

   The common network reference clock "I" is available to all the PE
   devices, and local oscillators "C" and "D" are locked to "I":

   o  One Synchronous Network:

      *  Clocks "E" and "J" are the same as "D" and "C" respectively.

      *  Clocks "A" and "G" are the same as "K" and "F" respectively
         (i.e., CE1 and CE2 use the so-called loop timing).

   o  Synchronous Carrier of Carriers:

      *  Clocks "A" and "G" are locked to the common reference clock "L"
         which is not locked to clock "I".

      *  More than one such clock is used by appropriate pairs of CE
         devices connected to the given pair of PE devices PE1 and PE2
         (otherwise it could be used by PE1 and PE2 as their common
         network reference clock "I").


4.2.2 Asynchronous Carrier of Carriers scenario

   The asynchronous scenario is characterized by:

   o  No common network reference clock "I" is available to PE1 and PE2.

   o  More than one reference clock is used by CE devices connected to
      PE1 and PE2.

   Asynchronous Carrier of Carriers scenario clearly represents the
   worst case for achieving the goal of balancing clocks "A" and "E".

   Note that one of the means available for achieving this goal is the
   compensation buffer in the CE-bound IWF, and the balance between
   clocks "A" and "E" must be exact over the period required for
   replaying out of this buffer.

   [##Ed-note##: The section about network synchronization reference
   models is for further discussion.]

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


5. Emulated Services

   This document defines requirements for the payload and encapsulation
   layers for edge-to-edge emulation of TDM services with structured
   payload as well as unstructured payload.

   Wherever possible, the requirements specified in this document SHOULD
   be satisfied by appropriate arrangements of the encapsulation layer
   only.  The (rare) cases when the requirements apply to both the
   encapsulation and payload layers (or even only to the payload layer
   only) will be explicitly noted.

   Applicability of these requirements to edge-to-edge-emulation of
   structured and unstructured SONET/SDH circuits is left for further
   study.

   The service-specific encapsulation layer for edge-to-edge emulation
   comprises the following TDM services over a PSN:

5.1 Structured TDM Circuits

   o  Transparent N*DS0, 1 <= N <= 31 as described in [G.704].
      This circuit can be accompanied by channel-associated or common
      channel CE application state signaling.


5.2 Unstructured TDM Circuits

   o  Unstructured E1 as described in [G.704].

   o  Unstructured T1 (DS1) as described in [G.704].

   o  Unstructured E3 as defined in [G.751].

   o  Unstructured T3 (DS3) as described in [T.107].

6. Generic Requirements

6.1 Relevant Common PW Requirements

   The combination of encapsulation and payload layers for edge-to-
   edge-emulation of TDM circuits considered in this document should
   comply with the following common PW requirements defined in [PWE3-
   REQ]:

   1.  Conveyance of Necessary L2/L1 Header Information:

       1.  For unstructured circuits this functionality MAY be provided
           by the payload layer.

       2.  For structured circuits, the necessary information MUST be
           provided by the encapsulation layer.

   2.  Support of Multiplexing and Demultiplexing if supported by the
       native services:

       1.  Relevant for N*DS0 circuits with or without signaling.

       2.  For these circuits means that the combination of
           encapsulation and payload layers MUST provide for separate
           treatment of every DS0 sub-circuit.

   3.  Intervention or transparent transfer of Control Messages of the
       Native Services depending on the particular scenario.

   4.  Consideration of the PSN Tunnel Header Overhead (see also Section
       7.5 below).

   5.  Detection and handling of PW faults.  The list of faults is given
       in Section 7.9 below.

   6.  Clock Recovery (see also Section 7.2 below).

6.2 Common Circuit Payload Requirements

   Structured circuits considered in this document belong to the generic
   'Structured Bit-Stream Payload' type defined in [PWE3-LAYERS].

   Unstructured circuits considered in this document belong to the
   generic Bit-Stream Payload type.

   Accordingly, the encapsulation layer MUST provide the common
   Sequencing service and SHOULD provide Timing information
   (Synchronization services).

   Note: The encapsulation layer for the (Structured) Bit-Stream Payload
   circuits MAY NOT provide the length service.

6.3 General Design Issues

   The combination of payload and encapsulation layers SHOULD comply
   with the general design principles of the Internet protocols as
   presented in [RFC1958], Section 3.

7. Service-Specific Requirements

7.1 Interworking

   1.  The emulation MUST support network interworking between end
       services of the same kind (structured, unstructured) and bit-
       rate.

   2.  The encapsulation layer SHOULD remain unaffected by specific
       characteristics of connection between the end services and PE
       devices at the two ends of the PW.


7.2 Network Synchronization

   1.  The encapsulation layer MUST provide synchronization services
       that are sufficient for:

       1.  balancing of clock of ingress and egress end services
           regardless of the specific network synchronization scenario,

       2.  keeping the jitter and wander of the clock of the egress
           service within the service-specific limits as defined by the
           appropriate normative references.

   2.  If the same high-quality synchronization source is available to
       all the PE devices in the given domain, the encapsulation layer
       SHOULD be able to offer additional benefits (e.g., facilitate
       better reconstruction of the native service clock).


7.3 Robustness

   The robustness of the emulated service does not only depend upon
   means applied to the edge-to-edge-emulation but also upon proper
   implementation of the procedures of the native TDM service.

7.3.1 Packet loss

   Edge-to-edge-emulation of TDM circuits MAY assume very low
   probability of packet loss between ingress and egress PE.  In
   particular, no retransmission mechanisms are required.

   In order to minimize effect of occasional loss of a single packet on
   the egress service, the encapsulation layer SHOULD:

   1.  Allow independent interpretation of TDM data in each specific
       packet by the egress PE (see [RFC2736].  This requirement MAY be



Riegel, et al.          Expires December 17, 2002              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


       disregarded if the egress PE has to interpret structures that
       exceed the path MTU between the ingress and egress PEs.

   2.  Allow reliable detection of lost packets (See next section).  In
       particular, it should allow prediction (within reasonable limits)
       of the arrival time of the next PW packet and detection of lost
       packets that takes such a prediction into account.

   3.  Minimize possible effect of lost packets on recovery of the
       circuit clock by the egress PE depending on the actual network
       synchronization scheme deployed.


7.3.2 Out-of-order delivery

   The encapsulation layer MUST provide the necessary mechanisms that
   guarantee ordered delivery of packets carrying the TDM data over the
   PSN.  Packets that have arrived out-of-order:

   1.  MUST be detected,

   2.  SHOULD [##Ed-Note##: MAY?] be reordered if not judged to be too
       late or too early for playout.

   Out-of-order packets that cannot be reordered MUST be treated as
   lost.

7.4 CE Signaling

   Unstructured TDM circuits do not usually require any special
   mechanisms for carrying CE signals as these would be carried as part
   of the emulated service.

   Some CE applications using structured TDM circuits (e.g., telephony)
   require specific signaling that conveys changes of state of these
   applications relative to the TDM data.

   The encapsulation layer SHOULD support signaling of state of CE
   applications for the relevant circuits providing for:

   1.  Ability to support different signaling schemes with minimal
       impact on encapsulation of TDM data,

   2.  Multiplexing of application-specific CE signals and data of the
       emulated service in the same PW,

   3.  Synchronization (within the application-specific tolerance
       limits) between CE signals and data at the PW egress,



Riegel, et al.          Expires December 17, 2002              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


   4.  Probabilistic recovery against possible occasional loss of
       packets in the PSN,

   5.  Deterministic recovery of the CE application state after PW setup
       and network outages.

   CE signaling that is used for maintenance purposes (loopback
   commands, performance monitoring data retrieval, etc.) SHOULD be
   dealt within the scope of the generic PWE3 maintenance protocol.

7.5 PSN bandwidth utilization

   1.  The encapsulation layer SHOULD allow for an effective trade-off
       between the following requirements:

       1.  Effective PSN bandwidth utilization.  Assuming that the size
           of encapsulation layer header does not depend on the size of
           its payload, increase in the packet payload size results in
           increased efficiency.

       2.  Low edge-to-edge latency.  Low end-to-end latency is the
           common requirement for Voice applications over TDM services.
           Packetization latency is one of the components comprising
           edge- to-edge latency and decreases with the packet payload
           size.

       The compensation buffer used by the CE-bound IWF increases
       latency to the emulated circuit.  Additional delay introduced by
       this buffer SHOULD NOT exceed the packet delay variation observed
       in the PSN.

   2.  The encapsulation layer SHOULD provide for saving the PSN
       bandwidth by not sending invalid TDM data across the PSN.

   3.  The encapsulation layer MAY provide the ability to save the PSN
       bandwidth for the structured case by not sending TDM timeslots
       that are inactive.


7.6 Packet Delay Variation

   In accordance with the PWE3 principles, the PWs do not exert any
   control over the underlying PSN.  In particular, the encapsulation
   layer for edge-to-edge-emulation of TDM circuits does neither affect
   one-way delay of packets from ingress to egress PE, nor its
   variation.

   The encapsulation layer SHOULD provide for ability to compensate for

Internet-Draft            PWE3 TDM Requirements                June 2002


   the packet delay variation without affecting jitter and wander of the
   egress end service clock.

   The encapsulation layer MAY provide for run-time adaptation of delay
   introduced by the jitter buffer if the packet delay variation varies
   with time.  Such an adaptation MAY introduce low level of errors
   (within the limits tolerated by the application) but SHOULD NOT
   introduce additional wander of the egress end service clock.

7.7 Compatibility with the Existing PSN Infrastructure

   The combination of encapsulation and PSN tunnel layers used for edge-
   to-edge emulation of TDM circuits SHOULD be compatible with the
   existing PSN infrastructures.  In particular, compatibility with the
   mechanisms of header compression over links where capacity is at a
   premium SHOULD be provided.

7.8 Congestion Control

   Edge-to-edge emulation of TDM circuits may result in constant bit
   rate flows in the PSN.  Such flows do not admit any meaningful
   congestion control.

7.9 Fault Detection and Handling

   The encapsulation layer for edge-to-edge emulation of TDM services
   SHOULD, separately or in conjunction with the lower layers of the
   PWE3 stack, provide for detection, handling and reporting of the
   following defects:

   1.  Misconnection, or Stray Packets.  Importance of this requirement
       stems from the customers' expectations based upon powerful means
       of misconnection detection in SONET/SDH networks.

   2.  Loss of packets.  Importance of this requirement stems from the
       providers' need to distinguish between various causes of the end-
       to-end outage of the emulated service.

   3.  Malformed packets.

   4.  Loss of synchronization.


7.10 Performance Monitoring

   The encapsulation layer for edge-to-edge emulation of TDM services
   SHOULD provide for collection of performance monitoring (PM) data
   that is compatible with the parameters defined for 'classic', TDM-

   left for further study.
