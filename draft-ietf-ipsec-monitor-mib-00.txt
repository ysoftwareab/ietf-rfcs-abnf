1. Introduction

   This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPSec.
   It does not define MIBs that may be used for configuring IPSec
   implementations or for providing low-level diagnostic or debugging
   information. It assumes no specific use of IPSec. Further, it does
   not provide policy information.

   The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to
   determine operating conditions and perform system operational level
   monitoring of the IPSec portion of their network. Statistics are
   provided as well. Additionally, it may be used as the basis for
   application specific MIBs for specific uses of IPSec.


2. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [2271].

   o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in


IPSec Working Group                                             [Page 2]

Internet Draft           IPSec Monitoring MIB               January 1999


     RFC 1155 [1155], RFC 1212 [1212] and RFC 1215 [1215]. The second
     version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [1902],
     RFC 1903 [1903] and RFC 1904 [1904].

   o Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second version of the SNMP message
     protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
     called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [1901] and
     RFC 1906 [1906]. The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [1906], RFC 2272 [2272]
     and RFC 2274 [2274].

   o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second set of protocol operations
     and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [1905].

   o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [2273] and
     the view-based access control mechanism described in
     RFC 2275 [2275].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2.1 Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
   use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object
   type.

3. IPSec MIB Objects Architecture

   The IPSec MIB provides information related to both phase 1 or
   Internet Key Exchange (IKE) security associations (SAs) and phase 2
   (or IPSec) SAs. Configuration about the SAs is provided as are
   statistics related to the SAs themselves. Additionally, the MIB
   provides a number of entity level aggregate totals for the SAs.

   There are also traps defined. These may be used by system
   administrators to help detect mis-configurations or possible attacks.


3.1 MIB Tables

   The MIB uses two tables to show phase 1 SAs and phase 2 SAs.

   The IPSec SAs appear in the IPSec protection suite table. IPSec
   protection suites are as defined by [ISAKMP]. An SA is effectively a
   protection suite that provides only a single security service.


3.2 Phase 1 Security Association Table

   Phase 1 SAs presented in the table contain information about their
   services provided, lifetime, end point authentication and some
   aggregate performance statistics.


3.3 Phase 2 Protection Suite Table

   As stated above, phase 2 SAs appear in the protection suite table.
   Since both protection suites and SAs are negotiated within IKE using
   a single proposal payload during a single quick mode, SAs are
   considered a subset of protection suites.

   [ISAKMP] also requires that attributes negotiated within a protection
   suite apply to all SAs. Therefore, the protection suite table
   provides expiration values, selectors and statistics only once for
   all SAs in a protection suite.

   Further, it is assumed that protection suites have only a single
   occurrence of any one of the three defined security services. (IP
   compression is considered a security service for the purposes of this
   MIB.) The order of these services within the protection suite is
   assumed to be compression before ESP before AH (in the
   encrypting/hashing direction) as also stated in [ISAKMP] and
   [SECARCH].

Internet Draft           IPSec Monitoring MIB               January 1999


   Entries in the protection suite table are uniquely identified by the
   SPI, remote IP address and security protocol.

   The table shows the security services, expiration values and SA
   statistics.

   Note that both statically keyed SAs and SAs created by a key exchange
   protocol may be shown in the table.


3.3.1 Asymmetric Use

   This MIB is defined assuming symmetric use of SAs and protection
   suites. That is to say that it assumes that an inbound SA is always
   set up with a corresponding outbound SA that provides the same
   security service.

   In cases where this MIB is required for asymmetric use, the
   corresponding objects that describe the unused direction may be set
   to the equivalent of the unknown or zero state.


3.3.2 Security Association Bundles

   This MIB does not explicitly show SA bundles or any combination of
   layered SAs that do not meet the protection suite definition as
   defined in [ISAKMP]. However, these may be represented in this MIB by
   separate protections suites with the appropriate set of selectors.


3.4 Notify Messages

   Notify messages sent from peer to peer are not necessarily sent as
   traps. However, they are collected as they occur and accumulated in a
   parse table structure.

   A notify message object is defined. This object is used as the index
   into the table of accumulated notify messages. This helps system
   administrators determine if there are potential configuration
   problems or attacks on their network.


3.5 IPSec MIB Traps

   Traps are provided to let system administrators know about the
   existence of error conditions occurring in the entity. Errors are
   associated with the creation and deletion of SAs, and also

Internet Draft           IPSec Monitoring MIB               January 1999


   operational errors that may indicate the presence of attacks on the
   system.

   Traps are not provided when SAs come up or go down, unless they
   cannot be negotiated or go down due to error conditions.

   The causes of SA negotiation failure are indicated by a notify
   message object.


3.6 IPSec Entity Level Objects

   This part of the MIB carries statistics global to the IPSec device.

   Statistics included are aggregate usage and aggregate errors for both
   phase 1 SAs and phase 2 protection suites. The statistics are
   provided as objects in a tree below these groups.

5. Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to IKE SAs and IPSec protection suites. There are no objects
   with MAX-ACCESS clauses of read-write or read-create.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to those objects through an insecure
   channel can provide attackers with more information about a system
   than an administrator may desire.


6. Acknowledgments

   This document is based in part on an earlier proposal titled "draft-
   ietf-ipsec-mib-xx.txt". That series was abandoned, since it included
   application specific constructs in addition to the IPSec only
   objects.

   Portions of the original document's origins were based on the working
   paper "IP Security Management Information Base" by R. Thayer and U.
   Blumenthal.

   Significant contribution to the IPSec MIB series of documents comes
   from Charles Brooks and Carl Powell, both of GTE Internetworking.
   Obviously, the IPSec working group made signification contributions,
   specifically including M. Daniele, T. Kivinen, J. Shriver, J. Walker,
   S. Kelly, J. Leonard and M. Richardson.

   Additionally, thanks are extended to Gabriella Dinescu for assistance
   in the preparation of the MIB structures.


7. Revision History

   This section will be removed before publication.

9. Appendix A - Some Related Assigned Numbers

   This appendix reproduces the assigned numbers from the referenced
   IPSec documents that are used in the MIB. They are to be used as a
   reference only and are not part of this specification. As the IPSec
   protocol evolves, this list is almost certain to become incomplete.

   Portions are blatantly copied from [IKE],[IPDOI] and [ISAKMP].
