1. Introduction 

   This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) of <Name 
   of ISP>.  It describes the practices employed by the <Name of ISP> 
   Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource Public Key 
   Infrastructure (RPKI).   These practices are defined in accordance 
   with the requirements of the Certificate Policy (CP, [RFCxxxx]) of 
   this PKI.  

   The RPKI is designed to support validation of claims by current 
   holders of Internet Number Resources (INRs, see definition in 1.7) in 
   accordance with the records of the organizations that act as CAs in 
   this PKI. The ability to verify such claims is essential to ensuring 
   the unique, unambiguous distribution of these resources 

   This PKI parallels the existing INR distribution hierarchy. These 
   resources are distributed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
   (IANA) to the Regional Internet Registries. In some regions, National 
   Internet Registries (NIRs) form a tier of the hierarchy below the 
   RIRs for internet number resource (INR) distribution. ISPs and 
   network subscribers form additional tiers below registries.

   This PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see IETF document 
   draft-ietf-sidr-arch-xx [ARCH] for more details): 

  . CA certificates for each organization distributing INRs and for 
     each subscriber 

  . End entity (EE) certificates for organizations to use to validate 
     digital signatures on RPKI-signed objects (see definition in 1.7). 

  . In the future, the PKI also may include end entity certificates in 
     support of access control for the repository system as described in 
     2.4.  

1.2. Document name and identification 

   The name of this document is ''<Name of ISP>'s Certification Practice 
   Statement for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)''.  

1.3. PKI participants 

   Note: In a PKI, the term ''subscriber'' refers to an individual or 
   organization that is a Subject of a certificate issued by a CA. The 
   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without 
   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of 
   the term to refer to an individual or organization that receives 
   service from an ISP. In such cases the term ''network subscriber'' will 
   be used. Also note that, for brevity, this document always refers to 
   PKI participants as organizations or entities, even though some of 
   them are individuals. 

       1.3.1. Certification authorities 

   <Describe the CAs that you will operate for the RPKI.  One approach 
   is to operate two CAs: one designated ''offline'' and the other 
   designated ''production.'' The offline CA is the top level CA for the 
   <Name of ISP> portion of the RPKI. It provides a secure revocation 
   and recovery capability in case the production CA is compromised or 
   becomes unavailable. Thus the offline CA issues certificates only to 
   instances of the production CA; and the CRLs it issues are used to 
   revoke only certificates issued to the production CA. The production 
   CA is used to issue RPKI certificates to <Name of ISP> members, to 
   whom INRs have been distributed.> 

       1.3.2. Registration authorities 

   <Describe how the registration authority function is handled for the 
   CA(s) that you operate.  The RPKI does not require establishment or

   use of a separate registration authority (RA) in conjunction with the 
   CA function. The RA function will be provided by the same entity 
   operating as a CA, e.g., entities listed in Section 1.3.1. An entity 
   acting as a CA in this PKI already has a formal relationship with 
   each organization to which it distributes INRs. These organizations 
   already perform the RA function implicitly since they already assume 
   responsibility for distributing INRs.>  

       1.3.3. Subscribers 

   The primary types of organizations that receive distributions of INRs 
   from this CA and thus are subscribers in the PKI sense are network 
   subscribers. 

       1.3.4. Relying parties 

   Entities or individuals that act in reliance on certificates or RPKI-
   signed objects issued under this PKI are relying parties. Relying 
   parties may or may not be subscribers within this PKI. (See section 
   1.7 for the definition of an RPKI-signed object.)  

       1.3.5. Other participants  

   <If <Name of ISP> operates a repository that holds certificates, 
   CRLs, and other RPKI-signed objects, then indicate this here.> 

1.4. Certificate usage 

       1.4.1. Appropriate certificate uses 

   The certificates issued under this hierarchy are for authorization in 
   support of validation of claims of current holdings of INRs. 

   Additional uses of the certificates, consistent with the basic goal 
   cited above, are also permitted under the RPKI certificate policy. 

   Some of the certificates that may be issued under this PKI could be 
   used to support operation of this infrastructure, e.g., access 
   control for the repository system as described in 2.4. Such uses also 
   are permitted under the RPKI certificate policy.  

       1.4.2. Prohibited certificate uses 

   Any uses other than those described in Section 1.4.1 are prohibited.

1.5. Policy administration 

       1.5.1. Organization administering the document 

   This CPS is administered by <Name of ISP> 

       1.5.2. Contact person 

   <Insert ISP contact info here> 

       1.5.3. Person determining CPS suitability for the policy 

   Not applicable.  Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI 
   is attesting to the distribution of INRs to the holder of the private 
   key corresponding to the public key in the certificate. The issuing 
   organizations are the same organizations as the ones that perform the 
   distribution hence they are authoritative with respect to the 
   accuracy of this binding.  

       1.5.4. CPS approval procedures 

   Not applicable. Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI 
   is attesting to the distribution of INRs to the holder of the private 
   key corresponding to the public key in the certificate. The issuing 
   organizations are the same organizations as the ones that perform the 
   distribution hence they are authoritative with respect to the 
   accuracy of this binding.  

1.6. Definitions and acronyms 


BPKI - Business PKI: A BPKI is an optional additional PKI used to 
       identify members to whom RPKI certificates can be issued. 

CP-    Certificate Policy. A CP is a named set of rules that indicates 
       the applicability of a certificate to a particular community 
       and/or class of applications with common security requirements. 

CPS -  Certification Practice Statement. A CPS is a document that 
       specifies the practices that a Certification Authority employs 
       in issuing certificates. 

Distribution of INRs -                          - A process of distribution of the INRs along the 
       respective number hierarchy. IANA distributes blocks of IP 
       addresses and Autonomous System Numbers to the five Regional

Internet-Draft          Template CPS for ISPs                March 2010 
    

       Internet Registries (RIRs). RIRs distribute smaller address 
       blocks and Autonomous System Numbers to organizations within 
       their service regions, who in turn distribute IP addresses to 
       their customers. 

IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. IANA is responsible for 
       global coordination of the Internet Protocol addressing systems 
       and Autonomous System (AS) numbers used for routing internet 
       traffic. IANA distributes INRs to Regional Internet Registries 
       (RIRs).  

INRs - Internet Number Resources. INRs are number values for three 
       protocol parameter sets, namely:  
          . IP Version 4 addresses,  

          . IP version 6 addresses, and  

          . Identifiers used in Internet inter-domain routing, currently 
            Border Gateway Protocol-4 Autonomous System numbers. 


ISP -         -  Internet Service Provider. An ISP is an organization managing 
       and selling Internet services to other organizations. 

NIR -         -  National Internet Registry. An NIR is an organization that 
       manages the distribution of INRs for a portion of the 
       geopolitical area covered by a Regional Registry. NIRs form an 
       optional second tier in the tree scheme used to manage INR 
       distribution.  

RIR -   Regional Internet Registry.  An RIR is an organization that 
       manages the distribution of INRs for a geopolitical area.  

RPKI-signed object -                        - An RPKI-signed object is a digitally signed data 
       object (other than a certificate or CRL) declared to be such by 
       a standards track RFC, and that can be validated using 
       certificates issued under this PKI. The content and format of 
       these data constructs depend on the context in which validation 
       of claims of current holdings of INRs takes place. Examples of 
       these objects are repository manifests and CRLs.

2. Publication And Repository Responsibilities 

2.1. Repositories 

   As per the CP, certificates, CRLs and RPKI-signed objects MUST be 
   made available for downloading by all relying parties, to enable them 
   to validate this data.  

   <If you maintain a local repository system, describe here its basic 
   set up. For example, ''The <Name of ISP> RPKI CA will publish 
   certificates, CRLs, and RPKI-signed objects via a repository that is 
   accessible via RSYNC at rpki.<Name of ISP>.net.''> 

2.2. Publication of certification information 

   <Name of ISP> MUST publish certificates, CRLs and RPKI-signed objects 
   issued by it to a repository that operates as part of a world-wide 
   distributed system of repositories. <Name of ISP> will also publish 
   to this repository system any RPKI-signed objects that it creates. 

2.3. Time or Frequency of Publication 

   <Describe here your procedures for publication (to the global 
   repository system) of the certificates, CRLs and RPKI-signed objects 
   that you issue. If you choose to outsource publication of PKI data, 
   you still need to provide this information for relying parties. This 
   should include the period of time within which a certificate will be 
   published after the CA issues the certificate and the period of time 
   within which a CA will publish a CRL with an entry for a revoked 
   certificate after it revokes that certificate.>  

   As per the CP, the following standard exists for publication times 
   and frequency: 

   The <Name of ISP> CA MUST publish its CRL prior to the 
   nextScheduledUpdate value in the scheduled CRL previously issued by 
   the CA.  

2.4. Access controls on repositories  

   Access to the repository system, for modification of entries, must be 
   controlled to prevent denial of service attacks. All data 
   (certificates, CRLs and RPKI-signed objects) published to a 
   repository are digitally signed RPKI items that <Name of Registry> 
   issues MUST be published to the repository that it runs by means not 
   accessible to the outside world. <If <Name of Registry> offers

   repository services to its subscribers, then <describe here the 
   protocol(s) that you support for their publishing of signed objects.>

3. Identification And Authentication 

3.1. Naming 

       3.1.1. Types of names 

   The Subject of each certificate issued by this ISP is identified by 
   an X.500 Distinguished Name (DN). The distinguished name will 
   consist of a single Common Name (CN) attribute with a value 
   generated by <Name of ISP>. Optionally, the serialNumber attribute 
   may be included along with the common name (to form a terminal 
   relative distinguished name set), to distinguish among successive 
   instances of certificates associated with the same entity. 

       3.1.2. Need for names to be meaningful 

   The Subject name in each subscriber certificate will be unique 
   relative to all certificates issued by <Name of ISP>. However, there 
   is no guarantee that the subject name will be globally unique in this 
   PKI. Also, the name of the subscriber need not to be ''meaningful'' in 
   the conventional, human-readable sense.  The certificates issued 
   under this PKI are used for authorization in support of applications 
   that make use of attestations of Internet resource holding, not for 
   identification 

       3.1.3. Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers 

   Although Subject names in certificates issued by this ISP need not be 
   meaningful, and may appear ''random,'' anonymity is not a function of 
   this PKI, and thus no explicit support for this feature is provided. 

       3.1.4. Rules for interpreting various name forms 

   None 

       3.1.5. Uniqueness of names 

   <Name of ISP> certifies Subject names that are unique among the 
   certificates that it issues. Although it is desirable that these 
   Subject names be unique throughout the PKI, to facilitate certificate 
   path discovery, such uniqueness is neither mandated nor enforced 
   through technical means.

Internet-Draft          Template CPS for ISPs                March 2010 
    

       3.1.6. Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks 

   Because the Subject names are not intended to be meaningful, there is 
   no provision to either recognize or authenticate trademarks, service 
   marks, etc. 

3.2. Initial identity validation 

       3.2.1. Method to prove possession of private key 

   <Describe the method whereby each subscriber will be required to 
   demonstrate proof-of-possession (PoP) of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate, prior to <Name of 
   ISP's> issuing the certificate. One possible approach makes use of 
   the PKCS #10 format, as profiled in [RFCyyyy]. This request format 
   requires that the PKCS #10 request be signed using the (RSA) private 
   key corresponding to the public key in the certificate request. This 
   mechanism provides proof of possession by the requester.> 

       3.2.2. Authentication of organization identity 

   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the 
   organizational identity of subscribers, with the exception of 
   registries. However, certificates are issued to subscribers in a 
   fashion that preserves the accuracy of distributions of INRs in this 
   <Name of ISP's> records.  

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that each 
   certificate that is issued, accurately reflects your records with 
   regard to the organization to which you have distributed (or sub-
   distributed) the INRs identified in the certificate. For example, a 
   BPKI certificate could be used to authenticate a certificate request 
   that serves as a link to the <Name of ISP's> subscriber database that 
   maintains the resource distribution records. The certificate request 
   could be matched against the database record for the subscriber in 
   question, and an RPKI certificate would be issued only if the 
   resources requested were a subset of those held by the subscriber. 
   The specific procedures employed for this purpose should be 
   commensurate with those you already employ as an ISP in the 
   maintenance of INR distribution.> 

       3.2.3. Authentication of individual identity 

   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the individual 
   identity of a subscriber. However, <Name of ISP> maintains contact 
   information for each subscriber in support of certificate renewal, 
   rekey, or revocation.

Internet-Draft          Template CPS for ISPs                March 2010 
    

   <Describe the procedures that MUST be used to identify at least one 
   individual as a representative of each subscriber. This is done in 
   support of issuance, renewal, and revocation of the certificate 
   issued to the organization. For example, one might say ''The <Name of 
   ISP> BPKI (see Section 3.2.6) issues certificates that MUST be used 
   to identify individuals who represent <Name of ISP> subscribers.'' The 
   procedures should be commensurate with those you already employ in 
   authenticating individuals as representatives for INR holders. Note 
   that this authentication is solely for use by you in dealing with the 
   organizations to which you distribute (or sub-distribute) INRs, and 
   thus must not be relied upon outside of this CA-subscriber 
   relationship.> 

       3.2.4. Non-verified subscriber information 

   No non-verified subscriber data is included in certificates issued 
   under this certificate policy except for SIA/AIA extensions. 

       3.2.5. Validation of authority 

   <Describe the procedures that MUST be used to verify that an 
   individual claiming to represent subscriber, is authorized to 
   represent that subscriber in this context. For example, one could 
   say, ''Only an individual to whom a BPKI certificate (see Section 
   3.2.6) has been issued may request issuance of an RPKI certificate. 
   Each certificate issuance request is verified using the BPKI.'' The 
   procedures should be commensurate with those you already employ as an 
   ISP in authenticating individuals as representatives of subscribers.> 

       3.2.6. Criteria for interoperation 

   The RPKI is neither intended nor designed to interoperate with any 
   other PKI. <If you operate a separate, additional PKI for business 
   purposes (BPKI), then describe (or reference) how the BPKI is used to 
   authenticate subscribers and to enable them to manage their resource 
   distributions.> 

3.3. Identification and authentication for re-key requests 

       3.3.1. Identification and authentication for routine re-key 

   <Describe the conditions under which routine re-key is required and 
   the manner by which it is requested. Describe the procedures that 
   MUST be used to ensure that a subscriber requesting routine re-key is 
   the legitimate holder of the certificate to be re-keyed. State the 
   approach for establishing PoP of the private key corresponding to the

   new public key. If you operate a BPKI, describe how that BPKI is used 
   to authenticate routine re-key requests.> 

       3.3.2. Identification and authentication for re-key after 
          revocation 

   <Describe the procedures that MUST be used to ensure that an 
   organization requesting a re-key after revocation is the legitimate 
   holder of the INRs in the certificate being re-keyed. This should 
   also include the method employed for verifying PoP of the private key 
   corresponding to the new public key. If you operate a BPKI, describe 
   how that BPKI is used to authenticate re-key requests. With respect 
   to authentication of the subscriber, the procedures should be 
   commensurate with those you already employ in the maintenance of INR 
   distribution records.> 

3.4. Identification and authentication for revocation request 

   <Describe the procedures that MUST be used by an RPKI subscriber to 
   make a revocation request.  Describe the manner by which it is 
   ensured that the subscriber requesting revocation is the subject of 
   the certificate (or an authorized representative thereof) to be 
   revoked. Note that there may be different procedures for the case 
   where the legitimate subject still possesses the original private key 
   as opposed to the case when it no longer has access to that key. 
   These procedures should be commensurate with those you already employ 
   in the maintenance of subscriber records.> 

   Note that if a subscriber requests a new INR distribution, an 
   existing RPKI certificate issued to the subscriber is NOT revoked, so 
   long as the set of INRs distributed to the subscriber did not 
   ''shrink,'' i.e., the new INRs are a superset of the old INR set. 
   However, if a new INR distribution results in ''shrinkage'' of the set 
   of INRs distributed to a subscriber, this triggers an implicit 
   revocation of the old RPKI certificate(s) associated with that 
   subscriber.

4. Certificate Life-Cycle Operational Requirements  

4.1. Certificate Application 

       4.1.1. Who can submit a certificate application 

   Any subscriber who holds INRs distributed by this ISP may submit a 
   certificate application to this CA. 

       4.1.2. Enrollment process and responsibilities 

   <Describe your enrollment process for issuing certificates both for 
   initial deployment of the PKI and as an ongoing process. Note that 
   most of the certificates in this PKI are issued as part of your 
   normal business practices, as an adjunct to INR distribution, and 
   thus a separate application to request a certificate may not be 
   necessary.  If so, reference should be made to where these practices 
   are documented.> 

4.2. Certificate application processing 

   <Describe the certificate request/response processing that you will 
   employ.  You should make use of existing standards for certificate 
   application processing.  Relevant standards include RFC 4210, 
   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Management 
   Protocol (CMP), RFC 2797, Certificate Management Messages over CMS, 
   and RSA Labs standards PKCS #7 and PKCS #10. >  

       4.2.1. Performing identification and authentication functions 

   <Describe your practices for identification and authentication of 
   certificate applicants.  Often, existing practices employed by you to 
   identify and authenticate organizations can be used as the basis for 
   issuance of certificates to these subscribers.  Reference can be made 
   to documentation of such existing practices.> 

       4.2.2. Approval or rejection of certificate applications 

   <Describe your practices for approval or rejection of applications 
   and refer to documentation of existing business practices relevant to 
   this process.  Note that according to the CP, certificate 
   applications will be approved based on the normal business practices 
   of the entity operating the CA, based on the CA's records of 
   subscribers. The CP also says that each CA will follow the procedures 
   specified in 3.2.1 to verify that the requester holds the private key 
   corresponding to the public key that will be bound to the certificate 
   the CA issues to the requester.>

   applications.> 

4.3. Certificate issuance 

       4.3.1. CA actions during certificate issuance 

   <Describe in this section your procedures for issuance and 
   publication of a certificate.>  

       4.3.2. Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of 
          certificate 

   <Name of ISP> MUST notify the subscriber when the certificate is 
   published. <Describe in this section your procedures for notification 
   of a subscriber when a certificate has been published.> 

       4.3.3. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other 
          entities 

   <Describe here any other entities that MUST be notified when a new 
   certificate is published.> 

4.4. Certificate acceptance 

       4.4.1. Conduct constituting certificate acceptance 

   When a certificate is issued, the CA MUST publish it to the 
   repository and notify the subscriber.  This will be done without 
   subscriber review and acceptance.  

       4.4.2. Publication of the certificate by the CA 

   Certificates MUST be published in the RPKI distributed repository 
   system once issued following the conduct described in 4.4.1. This 
   will be done within <specify the timeframe within which the 
   certificate will be placed in the repository and the subscriber will 
   be notified>.<Describe your procedures for publication of the 
   certificate.> 

4.5. Key pair and certificate usage 

   A summary of the use model for the RPKI is provided below.

       4.5.1. Subscriber private key and certificate usage 

   The certificates issued by <Name of ISP> to subscribers are CA 
   certificates. The private key associated with each of these 
   certificates is used to sign subordinate (CA or EE) certificates and 
   CRLs.  Subscribers who are ISPs will issue CA certificates to any 
   organizations to which they in turn distribute INRs, one or more end 
   entity (EE) certificates for use in verifying signatures on RPKI-
   signed objects signed by the suscriber, and end entity certificates 
   to operators in support of repository access control. Non-ISP INR 
   holders will issue just the latter two kinds of certificates since 
   they will not be distributing INRs to other organizations. 

       4.5.2. Relying party public key and certificate usage 

   The primary relying parties in this PKI are organizations who will 
   use EE certificates to verify RPKI-signed objects.  Repositories will 
   use operator certificates to verify the authorization of entities to 
   engage in repository maintenance activities, and thus repositories

4.6. Certificate renewal 

       4.6.1. Circumstance for certificate renewal 

   As per the CP, a certificate will be processed for renewal based on 
   its expiration date or a renewal request from the certificate 
   Subject.  If <Name of ISP> initiates the renewal process based on the 
   certificate expiration date, then <Name of ISP> will notify the 
   subscriber <insert the period of advance warning, e.g., ''2 weeks in 
   advance of the expiration date'', or the general policy, e.g., ''in 
   conjunction with notification of service expiration''.>  The validity 
   interval of the new (renewed) certificate will overlap that of the 
   previous certificate by <insert length of overlap period, e.g., 1 
   week>, to ensure uninterrupted coverage.  

   Certificate renewal will incorporate the same public key as the 
   previous certificate, unless the private key has been reported as 
   compromised.  If a new key pair is being used, the stipulations of 
   Section 4.7 will apply. 

       4.6.2. Who may request renewal 

   The subscriber or <Name of ISP> may initiate the renewal process. 
   <For the case of the subscriber, describe the procedures that will be 
   used to ensure that the requester is the legitimate holder of the 
   INRs in the certificate being renewed. This should also include the

   method employed for verifying PoP of the private key corresponding to 
   the public key in the certificate being renewed or the new public key 
   if the public key is being changed.  With respect to authentication 
   of the subscriber, the procedures should be commensurate with those 
   you already employ in the maintenance of INR distribution records. If 
   you operate a BPKI for this, describe how that business-based PKI is 
   used to authenticate re-newal requests and refer to 3.2.6.> 

       4.6.3. Processing certificate renewal requests 

  <Describe your procedures for handling certificate renewal requests.  
  This must include verification that the requester is the subscriber 
  or is authorized by the subscriber and that the certificate in 
  question has not been revoked.>  
       4.6.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   <Name of ISP> MUST notify the subscriber when the certificate is 
   published <Describe your procedure for notification of new 
   certificate issuance to the subscriber. This should be consistent 
   with 4.3.2.> 

       4.6.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of a renewal certificate 

   When a renewal certificate is issued, the <name of ISP> CA MUST 
   publish it to the repository and notify the subscriber.  This will be 
   done without subscriber review and acceptance. 

       4.6.6. Publication of the renewal certificate by the CA 

   <Describe your policy and procedures for publication of a renewal 
   certificate. This should be consistent with 4.4.2.> 

       4.6.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other 
          entities 

   <List here any other entities (besides the subscriber) who will be 
   notified when a renewed certificate is issued.> 

4.7. Certificate re-key 

       4.7.1. Circumstance for certificate re-key 

   As per the CP, re-key of a certificate will be performed only when 
   required, based on:

   1. knowledge or suspicion of compromise or loss of the associated 
      private key, or  

   2. the expiration of the cryptographic lifetime of the associated key 
      pair  

   If a certificate is revoked to replace the RFC 3779 extensions, the 
   replacement certificate will incorporate the same public key, not a 
   new key, unless the subscriber requests a re-key at the same time. 

   If the re-key is based on a suspected compromise, then the previous 
   certificate will be revoked.  

   Section 5.6 of the Certificate Policy notes that when a CA signs a 
   certificate, the signing key should have a validity period that 
   exceeds the validity period of the certificate.  This places 
   additional constraints on when a CA should request a re-key. 

       4.7.2. Who may request certification of a new public key 

   Only the subscriber may request a re-key. In addition, <Name of ISP> 
   may initiate a re-key based on a verified compromise report. <If the 
   subscriber (certificate Subject) requests the rekey, describe how 
   authentication is effected, e.g., using the <Name of Registry> BPKI. 
   Describe how a compromise report received from other than a 
   subscriber is verified.>   

       4.7.3. Processing certificate re-keying requests 

   <Describe your process for handling re-keying requests.  As per the 
   CP, this should be consistent with the process described in Section 
   4.3.  So reference can be made to that section.> 

       4.7.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   <Describe your policy regarding notifying the subscriber re: 
   availability of the new re-keyed certificate.  This should be 
   consistent with the notification process for any new certificate 
   issuance (see section 4.3.2).> 

       4.7.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of a re-keyed certificate 

   When a re-keyed certificate is issued, the CA will publish it in the 
   repository and notify the subscriber.  This will be done without 
   subscriber review and acceptance.

       4.7.6. Publication of the re-keyed certificate by the CA 

   <Describe your policy regarding publication of the new certificate.  
   This should be consistent with the publication process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.2).> 

       4.7.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other 
          entities 

   <List here any entities (other than the subscriber) who will be 
   notified when a re-keyed certificate is issued.> 

4.8. Certificate modification 

       4.8.1. Circumstance for certificate modification 

   As per the CP, modification of a certificate occurs to implement 
   changes to the RFC 3779 extension values in a certificate.  A 
   subscriber can request a certificate modification when this 
   information in a currently valid certificate has changed, as a result 
   of changes in the INR holdings of the subscriber.  

   If a subscriber is to receive a distribution of INRs in addition to a 
   current distribution, and if the subscriber does not request that a 
   new certificate be issued containing only these additional INRs, then 
   this is accomplished through a certificate modification. When a 
   certificate modification is approved, a new certificate is issued.  
   The new certificate will contain the same public key and the same 
   expiration date as the original certificate, but with the incidental 
   information corrected and/or the INR distribution expanded. When 
   previously distributed INRs are to be removed from a certificate, 
   then the old certificate MUST be revoked and a new certificate 
   (reflecting the new distribution) issued.  

       4.8.2. Who may request certificate modification 

   The subscriber or <Name of ISP> may initiate the certificate 
   modification process. <For the case of the subscriber, state here 
   what steps will be taken to verify the identity and authorization of 
   the entity requesting the modification.> 

       4.8.3. Processing certificate modification requests 

   <Describe your procedures for verification of the modification 
   request and procedures for the issuance of a new certificate.  These 
   should be consistent with the processes described in Sections 4.2 and 
   4.3.1.>

       4.8.4. Notification of modified certificate issuance to 
          subscriber 

   <Describe your procedure for notifying the subscriber about the 
   issuance of a modified certificate.  This should be consistent with 
   the notification process for any new certificate (see section 
   4.3.2).> 

       4.8.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of modified certificate 

   When a modified certificate is issued, the CA will publish it to the 
   repository and notify the subscriber.  This will be done without 
   subscriber review and acceptance. 

       4.8.6. Publication of the modified certificate by the CA 

   <Describe your procedure for publication of a modified certificate.  
   This should be consistent with the publication process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.2).> 

       4.8.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other 
          entities  

   <List here any entities (other than the subscriber) who will be 
   notified when a modified certificate is issued. 

4.9. Certificate revocation and suspension 

       4.9.1. Circumstances for revocation 

   As per the CP, certificates can be revoked for several reasons.  
   Either <Name of ISP> or the subject may choose to end the 
   relationship expressed in the certificate, thus creating cause to 
   revoke the certificate. If one or more of the INRs bound to the 
   public key in the certificate are no longer associated with the 
   subject, that too constitutes a basis for revocation. A certificate 
   also may be revoked due to loss or compromise of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  Finally, a 
   certificate may be revoked in order to invalidate data signed by the 
   private key associated with that certificate.   

       4.9.2. Who can request revocation 

   The subscriber or <Name of ISP> may request a revocation. <For the 
   case of the subscriber, describe what steps will be taken to verify 
   the identity and authorization of the entity requesting the 
   revocation.>

   <Describe your process for handling a certificate revocation request.  
   This should include:  

   o  Procedure to be used by the subscriber to request a revocation 

   o  Procedure for notification of the subscriber when the revocation 
      is initiated by <Name of ISP>.> 

       4.9.4. Revocation request grace period 

   A subscriber should request revocation as soon as possible after the 
   need for revocation has been identified.  

       4.9.5. Time within which CA must process the revocation request 

   <Describe your policy on the time period within which you will 
   process a revocation request.> 

       4.9.6. Revocation checking requirement for relying parties 

   As per the CP, a relying party is responsible for acquiring and 
   checking the most recent, scheduled CRL from the issuer of the 
   certificate, whenever the relying party validates a certificate. 

       4.9.7. CRL issuance frequency  

   <State the CRL issuance frequency for the CRLs that you publish.> < 
   Each CRL will carry a nextScheduledUpdate value and a new CRL will be 
   published at or before that time. <Name of ISP> will set the 
   nextScheduledUpdate value when it issues a CRL, to signal when the 
   next scheduled CRL will be issued. 

       4.9.8. Maximum latency for CRLs  

   A CRL will be published to the repository system within <state the 
   maximum latency> after generation.

6. Technical Security Controls 

   This section describes the security controls used by <Name of ISP>.  

6.1. Key pair generation and installation 

       6.1.1. Key pair generation 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to generate the CA key 
   pair, and, if applicable, key pairs for subscribers.  In most 
   instances, public-key pairs will be generated by the subscriber, 
   i.e., the organization receiving the distribution of INRs.  However, 
   your procedures may include one for generating key pairs on behalf of 
   your subscribers if they so request. (This might be done for 
   subscribers who do not have the ability to perform key generation in 
   a secure fashion or who want a registry to provide backup for the 
   subscriber private key.) Since the keys used in this PKI are not for 
   non-repudiation purposes, generation of key pairs by CAs does not 
   inherently undermine the security of the PKI.> 

       6.1.2. Private key delivery to subscriber 

   <If the procedures in 6.1.1 include providing key pair generation 
   services for subscribers, describe the means by which private keys 
   are delivered to subscribers in a secure fashion. Otherwise say this 
   is not applicable.> 

       6.1.3. Public key delivery to certificate issuer 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to deliver a subscriber's 
   public keys to the <Name of ISP> RPKI CA.  These procedures should 
   ensure that the public key has not been altered during transit and 
   that the subscriber possesses the private key corresponding to the 
   transferred public key. > 

       6.1.4. CA public key delivery to relying parties 

   CA public keys for all entities (other than trust anchors) are 
   contained in certificates issued by other CAs and MUST be published 
   to the RPKI repository system. Relying parties MUST download these 
   certificates from this system. Public key values and associated data 
   for (putative) trust anchors MUST be distributed out of band and 
   accepted by relying parties on the basis of locally-defined criteria, 
   e.g., embedded in path validation software that will be made 
   available to the Internet community.

   statement.>  

   <If the procedures in 6.1.1 include subscriber key pair generation, 
   EITHER insert here text specifying that the subscriber is responsible 
   for performing checks on the quality of its key pair and saying that 
   <Name of ISP> is not responsible for performing such checks for 
   subscribers OR describe the procedures used by the CA for checking 
   the quality of these subscriber key pairs.> 

       6.1.7. Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field) 

   The Key usage extension bit values will be consistent with RFC 5280. 
   For <Name of ISP>'s CA certificates, the keyCertSign and cRLSign bits 
   will be set TRUE. All other bits (including digitalSignature) will be 
   set FALSE, and the extension will be marked critical. <Specify 
   whether end entity certificates (e.g., issued by the CA for its 
   operators) will include this extension and if so, the appropriate bit 
   values as per RFC 5280.> 

6.2. Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering 
   Controls 

       6.2.1. Cryptographic module standards and controls 

   The <Name of ISP> CA employs a cryptographic module evaluated under 
   FIPS 140-2/3, at level 2 or 3 [FIPS].  

       6.2.2. Private key (n out of m) multi-person control 

   <If you choose to use multi-person controls to constrain access to 
   your CA's private keys, then insert the following text. ''There will 
   be private key <insert here n> out of <insert here m> multi-person 
   control.''>  

       6.2.3. Private key escrow 

   No private key escrow procedures are required for this PKI.

       6.2.4. Private key backup 

   <Describe the procedures used for backing up your CA's private key.  
   The following aspects should be included. (1) The copying should be 
   done under the same multi-party control as is used for controlling 
   the original private key.  (2) At least one copy should be kept at an 
   off-site location for disaster recovery purposes.> 
       6.2.5. Private key archival 

   See sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 

       6.2.6. Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module 

   The private key for <Name of ISP>'s production CA <if appropriate, 
   change ''production CA'' to ''production and offline CAs''> MUST be 
   generated by the cryptographic module specified in 6.2.1.  The 
   private keys will never leave the module except in encrypted form for 
   backup and/or transfer to a new module. 
       6.2.7. Private key storage on cryptographic module 

   The private key for <Name of ISP>'s production CA <if appropriate, 
   change ''production CA'' to ''production and offline CAs''> MUST be 
   stored in the cryptographic module and will be protected from 
   unauthorized use in accordance with the FIPS 140-2/3 requirements 
   applicable to the module. (See [FIPS]) 

       6.2.8. Method of activating private key 

   <Describe the mechanisms and data used to activate your CA's private 
   key.> 

       6.2.9. Method of deactivating private key 

   The cryptographic module, when activated, will not be left 
   unattended.  After use, it will be deactivated by <Describe the 
   procedure for deactivation of your CA's private key.> The module will 
   be stored securely when not in use. 

       6.2.10. Method of destroying private key 

   <Describe the method used for destroying your CA's private key, e.g., 
   when it is superseded.  This will depend on the particular module.>

       6.2.11. Cryptographic Module Rating 

   The cryptographic module will be certified FIPS 140-2/3, at level 2 
   or 3 [FIPS].  

6.3. Other aspects of key pair management 

       6.3.1. Public key archival 

   Because this PKI does not support non-repudiation, there is no need 
   to archive public keys. 

       6.3.2. Certificate operational periods and key pair usage 
          periods 

   The <Name of ISP> CA's key pair will have a validity interval of 
   <insert number of years -                                - ISP key pairs and certificates should have 
   reasonably long validity intervals, e.g., 10 years, to minimize the 
   disruption caused by key changeover.>   

6.4. Activation data 

       6.4.1. Activation data generation and installation 

   <Describe how activation data for your CA will be generated.>

   The degree to which a relying party can trust the binding embodied in 
   a certificate depends on several factors.  These factors can include 
   the practices followed by the certification authority (CA) in 
   authenticating the subject; the CA's operating policy, procedures, 
   and technical security controls, including the scope of the 
   subscriber's responsibilities (for example, in protecting the private 
   key), and the stated responsibilities and liability terms and 
   conditions of the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of 
   warranties, and limitations of liability). This document provides a 
   framework to address the technical, procedural, personnel, and 
   physical security aspects of Certification Authorities, Registration 
   Authorities, repositories, subscribers, and relying party 
   cryptographic modules, in order to ensure that the certificate 
   generation, publication, renewal, re-key, usage, and revocation is 
   done in a secure manner.  Specifically, Section 3 Identification and 
   Authentication (I&A); Section 4 Certificate Life-Cycle Operational 
   Requirements; Section 5 Facility Management, and Operational 
   Controls; Section 6 Technical Security Controls; Section 7 
   Certificate and CRL Profiles; and Section 8 Compliance Audit and 
   Other Assessments are oriented towards ensuring secure operation of 
   the PKI entities such as CA, RA, repository, subscriber systems, and 
   relying party systems.
