Internet-Draft           HIP Experiment Report              October 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document summarizes the work and experiences of the Host
   Identity Protocol IRTF Research Group (HIP-RG).  The HIP-RG was
   chartered to explore the possible benefits and consequences of
   deploying the Host Identity Protocol architecture [1] in the
   Internet.

1.1  What is HIP?

   The Host Identity Protocol introduces a new name space, the "host
   identity" name space, to the Internet architecture.  The express
   purpose of this new name space is to allow for the decoupling of
   identifiers (host identities) and locators (IP addresses) in the
   architecture.  The authors and technical contributors to HIP have
   assumed that HIP will allow for alternative solutions for several of
   the Internet's challenging technical problems.  Although there have
   been many architectural proposals to decouple identifiers and
   locators over the past 20 years, HIP is currently the most actively
   developed proposal in this area.  A number of experimental draft
   specifications are in work in the IETF's HIP Working Group, including
   the  HIP base protocol [2], among other drafts dealing with mobility
   management, DNS resource records, and HIP rendezvous servers.

   Section 2 below provides an overview of HIP.

1.2  Scope

   The research group is tasked with producing an "experiment report"
   documenting the collective experiences and lessons learned from other
   studies, related experimentation, and designs completed by the
   research group.  The question of whether the basic identifier/locator
   split assumption is valid falls beyond the scope of this research
   group.  When indicated by its studies, the HIP RG can suggest
   extensions and modifications to the protocol and architecture.  It is
   also in scope for the RG to study, in a wider sense, the consequences
   and effects that wide-scale adoption of any type of separation of the
   identifier and locator roles of IP addresses is likely to have.

2.  HIP architectural overview

   Note:  The purpose of this section is to summarize basic features
   (identifier name space, handshake, mob.  mgmt., multi-homing, DNS RR,
   and initial rendezvous) and then introduce more advanced proposals
   (HIT resolution, advanced rendezvous/overlay architectures,
   lighterweight HIP, ...).  For example, some infrastructure impacts
   might be overcome by a clever idea that someone proposed but that is
   not yet included in the HIP-WG scope.

2.1  Basic HIP architectural elements

2.1.1  Separating identifier from locator

   Reference Saltzer, Chiappa, others...  Just briefly touch on the
   implications of this (less security if not secured somehow, need for
   new name service)

2.1.2  Cryptographic name space

   Introduce motivation for this part of HIP

2.1.3  HIP handshake

   Reference SIGMA and client puzzles papers for more information

2.1.4  Mobility management

   briefly describe how this works, and provide reference

2.1.5  Initial rendezvous

   briefly describe how this works, and provide reference

2.1.6  Host multihoming

   briefly describe how this works, and provide reference

2.1.7  DNS resource record

   briefly describe how this works, and provide reference

2.2  Advanced HIP concepts

2.2.1  Referrals

   a.k.a.  HIT resolution

Internet-Draft           HIP Experiment Report              October 2004


2.2.2  Overlay routing and rendezvous

   Discuss the work on i3, Lars's more advanced draft, ...

2.2.3  Lighterweight HIP

   Discuss and reference the multi6 proposal.

2.2.4  Common Endpoint Locator Pools (CELP)

   Introduce the problem, and reference Crocker/Doria.

2.2.5  NAT traversal

   Dealing with legacy middleboxes.

2.2.6  Managing identities and privacy

   e.g.  location privacy

2.2.7  BLIND

   keeping complete identity protection

2.2.8  native API

   reference Mika's work

2.2.9  HIP cookie mechanism

   more egalitarian cookie functions?

3.  HIP architectural/deployment impact

   This section describes positive and negative implications of
   deploying HIP.  Where possible, we provide experimental evidence to
   support claims-- otherwise, identify them as conjecture.

   Initial list of issues to cover here:
   1.  Impact on host stack implementations
   2.  application impact and API
   3.  impact on DNS
   4.  managing and securing host identities
   5.  access control lists
   6.  firewall/NAT issues
   7.  HIT resolution infrastructure
   8.  location privacy issues
   9.  advanced rendezvous/overlay architectures
   10.  lighterweight HIP

4.  HIP experience

   This section describes any real-world HIP experience.  Include also
   recommendations to change HIP?

   HIP experience:
   1.  DoS protection on HIP handshake
   2.  managing locator sets
   3.  NAT traversal experience
   4.  rendezvous server experience
   5.  application experience
   6.  implementation experience
