Internet-Draft     Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers        March 2007


Abstract

   Interface Identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify
   interfaces on a link.  They are required to be unique within a
   subnet.  Several RFCs have specified interface identifiers or
   identifier ranges that have a special meaning attached to them.  An
   IPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these ranges
   will encounter unexpected consequences.  Since there is no
   centralized repository for such reserved identifiers, this document
   aims to create one.

2.  Introduction

   An IPv6 unicast address is composed of two parts.  A subnet prefix
   and an interface identifier (IID) that identifies an unique interface
   within the subnet prefix.  The structure of an IPv6 unicast address
   is depicted in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291] and is
   replicated here for clarity.

   |                         n bits                 |   128-n bits   |
   +------------------------------------------------+----------------+
   |                   subnet prefix                | interface ID   |
   +------------------------------------------------+----------------+

                   Figure 1: IPv6 Unicast Address Format

   For all unicast addresses, except those that start with binary value
   000, Interface identifiers are required to be 64 bits long (i.e.
   n==64) .  If the interface identifiers are generated from an unique
   token like an ethernet MAC address, they need to set bit 6 of the
   first octet to one.  If they are not generated from an unique token
   they need to set bit 6 to zero.  Examples of mechanisms that generate
   interface identifiers without an unique token include
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses [RFC3972], Privacy Addresses
   [PRIVACY], Hash Based Addresses [HBA] etc.  Non-unique interface
   identifiers can also be allocated using managed address assignment
   mechanisms like DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

3.  Issues with reusing reserved Interface Identifiers

   Let us assume a node comes up with an interface identifier that has
   been reserved for use in some other capacity. e.g.  An IPv6 node that
   uses temporary IPv6 addresses [PRIVACY] comes up with an IID of fdff:
   ffff:ffff:fffe .  This node will receive requests from all nodes that
   are requesting a service from a MobileIPv6 home agent.  At best this
   is an annoyance to the node that came up with this address.  In the
   worst case scenario another node on the link would be denied service
   and may not look for other methods of acquiring a home agent.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the creation of an IANA registry for reserved
   IPv6 Interface Identifiers.  Initial values for the reserved IPv6
   Interface Identifiers are given below.

   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
   |        Interface Identifier Range       |       Description       |
   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
   | 0000:0000:0000:0000-0000:0000:0000:0000 |  Subnet Router Anycast  |
   |                                         |        [RFC4291]        |
   |                                         |                         |
   | 0000:5efe:0000:0000-0000:5efe:ffff:ffff |     ISATAP [RFC4214]    |
   |                                         |                         |
   | fdff:ffff:ffff:ff80-fdff:ffff:ffff:fffd | Reserved Subnet Anycast |
   |                                         |        [RFC2526]        |
   |                                         |                         |
   | fdff:ffff:ffff:fffe-fdff:ffff:ffff:fffe |  MobileIPv6 Home Agents |
   |                                         |    Anycast [RFC2526]    |
   |                                         |                         |
   | fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff-fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff | Reserved Subnet Anycast |
   |                                         |        [RFC2526]        |
   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+

                       Table 1: Current Assignments

   It is possible that implementations might predate a specific
   assignment from this registry and hence not be cognizant of the
   reserved nature of the interface identifier.  Hence. future
   assignments from this registry are discouraged but in exceptional
   circumstances are to be made through Expert Review [IANABIS].
   Assignments consist of a single interface identifier or a range of
   interface identifiers.

5.  Security Considerations

   Information that creates or updates a registration needs to be
   authenticated and authorized.  By utilizing one of the reserved
   interface identifiers an IPv6 node might receive requests that it is
   not authorized to receive.
