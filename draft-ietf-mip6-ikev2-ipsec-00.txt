Internet-Draft    Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and revised IPsec  October 2004


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3776 describes how IPsec [7] is used with Mobile IPv6 [2] to
   protect the signaling messages.  It also illustrates the Security
   Policy Database and Security Association Database entries required to
   protect Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.

   The IPsec architecture has been revised [5].  Among the many changes,
   the list of selectors has been expanded to included the Mobility
   Header message type.  This has an impact on how security policies and
   security associations are configured for protecting mobility header
   messages.  It becomes easier to differentiate between the various
   Mobility Header messages based on the type value instead of checking
   if a particular mobility header message is being sent on a tunnel
   interface between the MN and the HA, as it was in RFC 3776.  The
   revised IPsec architecture specification also includes ICMP message
   type and code as selectors.  This makes it possible to protect Mobile
   Prefix Discovery messages without applying the same security
   associations to all ICMPv6 messages.

   This document discusses new requirements for the Home Agent and the
   Mobile Node to use the revised IPsec architecture and IKEv2.  Section
   3.2 lists the requirements.  Section 3 describes the differences with
   RFC 3776.  Section 4 describes the required Security Policy Database
   (SPD) and Security Association Database (SAD) entries.

   The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has also been substantially revised
   and simplified [4].  This document describes how IKEv2 can be used to
   setup security associations for Mobile IPv6.

   The use of EAP within IKEv2 is allowed to authenticate the Mobile
   Node to the Home Agent.  This is described in Section 6.  A method
   for dynamically configuring a Home Address from the Home Agent using
   the Configuration Payload in IKEv2 is described in Section 7.

3.  What is applicavble from RFC 3776?

3.1  Packet Formats

   The Mobile Node and the Home Agent MUST support the packet formats as
   defined in Seciton 3 of RFC 3776.

3.2  Requirements

   The Mobile Node and the Home Agent MUST support the requirements
   listed in Section 4 of RFC 3776 with the following exceptions.

   o  It is not required to configure security policies per interface in
      order to protect return routability signaling messages.  Since the
      Mobility Header message type is a selector, it is easy to
      differentiate HoTi and HoT messages from other Mobility Header
      messages.

   o  It is necessary to avoid a condition where a mobile ndoe could use
      its security association to send a Binding Update on behalf of
      another Mobile Node.  With manual IPsec configuration, the Home
      Agent MUST be able to verify that a security association was
      created for a particular Home Address.  With dynamic keying, it
      should be possible for the Home Agent to verify that the identity
      presented in the IKE_AUTH exchange is allowed to create security
      associations for a particular home address.

   o  The Mobile Node should use its Care-of Address as source address
      in protocol exchanges, when using dynamic keying.  However, the
      security associations MUST be created for the Home Address of the
      Mobile Node.

   o  The Mobile Node and the Home Agent MUST create security
      associations based on the Home Address, so that the security
      associations survive change in Care-of Address.  When using IKEv2
      as the key exchange protocol, the TSi payload during the
      CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange [4] MUST carry the Home Address of the
      Mobile Node.


3.2.1  Home Agent Requirements

   This section describes some new and additional requirements on the
   Home Agent.

   o  The Home Agent MUST support Mobility Header message type as an
      IPsec selector.

Internet-Draft    Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and revised IPsec  October 2004


   o  The Home Agent MUST support ICMPv6 message type as an IPsec
      selector.

   o  The Home Agent MUST be able to distinguish between HoTi messages
      sent to itself, when it is acting as a Correspondent Node) from
      those sent to Correspondent Nodes when it is acting as a Home
      Agent, based on the destination address of the packet.

   o  The Home Agent MUST have an entry for each Mobile Node in its Peer
      Authorization Database (PAD), [5].  The PAD entry for a Mobile
      Node contains either a shared key or a trust anchor to verify the
      Mobile Node's certificate.

   o  The Home Agent MUST support remote configuration of Home Address
      as descrined in Section 7.  When the Home Agent receives a
      configuration payload with a CFG_REQUEST for INTERNAL_IP6_ADDR, it
      must reply with a valid Home Address for the Mobile Node.  The
      Home Agent could pick a Home Address from a local database or from
      a DHCPv6 server on the home link.

   o  The Home Agent MAY support authentication using EAP in IKEv2 as
      described in Section 2.16 of [4].


3.2.2  Mobile Node Requirements

   This section describes new additional requirements on the Mobile
   Node.

   o  The Mobile Node MUST support Mobility Header message type as an
      IPsec selector.

   o  The Mobile Node MUST supprt ICMPv6 message type as an IPsec
      selector.

   o  The Mobile Node MAY support EAP as an authentication mechanism
      when using IKEv2 to setup security associations for protecting
      Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.

   o  The Mobile Node MAY support the mechanism described in Section 7
      to dynamically configure a Home Address.

4.  Manual Configuration

   This section describes the SPD and SAD entries necessary to protect
   the Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  The format used to describe the
   SPD and SAD entries is the same as described in RFC 3776.

   For the examples described in this document, a Mobile Node with home
   address, "home_address_1", a Home Agent with addres, "home_agent_1"
   and a user of the Mobile Node with identity "user_1" are assumed.

5.1.4  Payload Packets

   The SPD and SAD entries shown in Section 5.3.4 of [3] are applicable
   here.  This document does not update the SPD and SAD entries
   described in RFC3776 for protecting payload packets.

5.2  Security Association negotiation using IKEv2

   Mobile IPv6 signaling messages are always first initiated by the
   Mobile Node.  The Mobile Node sends a Binding Update to the Home
   Agent whenever it moves and acquires a new Care-of Address.

   The Mobile Node initiates an IKEv2 protocol exchange if the required
   security associations are not present.  For authenticating the Home
   Agent, public key based mechanisms MUST be used.  The Mobile Node
   includes a Certificate Request payload in the first message sent in
   the IKE_AUTH exchange.  If the Mobile Node is using a shared key for
   authentication, it uses the shared key to generate the AUTH payload
   in the IKE_AUTH exchange.  If the Mobile Node is using a public key
   based mechanism, then it uses its private key to generate the AUTH
   payload in the IKE_AUTH exchange.  The Mobile Node MUST always
   includes its identity in the IDi payload in the IKE_AUTH exchange.
   The Mobile Node could use a FQDN or RFC 822 [13] identifier as
   identities.  In case the Mobile Node uses FQDN, it sets the IDi type
   to ID_FQDN.  In case, the Mobile Nodes uses a RFC 822 kind of
   identifier, it sets the IDi type to ID_RFC822_ADDR.

   After the IKE_AUTH exchange completes, the Mobile Node and the Home
   Agent initiate CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges to negotiate security
   associations for protecting Binding Update/Binding Ack messages,
   Return Routability signaling, Mobile Prefix Discovery messages and
   optionally payload traffic.  The CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges are
   protected by the security association created during the IKE_AUTH
   exchange.

   It is important that the security associations are created based on
   the Home Address of the Mobile Node, so that the security
   associations survive Care-of Address change.  The Mobile Node MUST
   set the TSi (Traffic Selector-initiator) payload to its Home Address
   in the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange in order to create the security
   associations for the Home Address.

6.  The use of EAP authentication

   In addition to using public key signatures and shared secrets, EAP
   [14] can be used with IKEv2 for authenticating the Mobile Node to the
   Home Agent.

   The Mobile Node indicates that it wants to use EAP by including the
   IDi payload but leaving out the AUTH payload in the first message
   during the IKE_AUTH exchange.  The Home Agent includes an EAP payload
   if it is willing to use an extensible authentication method.
   Security associations are not created until the subsequent IKE_AUTH
   exchange after successful EAP authentication.

7.  Dynamic Home Address Configuration

   The Mobile Node can dynamically configure a Home Address by including
   a Configuration Payload with a request for an address from the home
   link.  The Mobile Node MUST include an INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS and
   INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attributes in the Configuration Payload.  The
   Mobile Node MAY also include an INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attribute.

   When the Home Agent receives a configuration payload with a
   CFG_REQUEST for INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS, it replies with a valid Home
   Address for the Mobile Node.  The Home Agent could use a local
   database or contact a DHCPv6 server on the home link to allocate a
   Home Address.  The Home Agent MUST also include an
   INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY attribute to indicate to the Mobile Node, the
   duration for which the dynamically allocated Home Address is valid.

   In case the Home Agent is unable to allocate a Home Address for the
   Mobile Node during the IKE_AUTH exhcange, it MUST send a Notify
   Payload with an INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE message.

        Mobile Node                        Home Agent
