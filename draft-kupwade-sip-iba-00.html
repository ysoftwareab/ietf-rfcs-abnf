<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Session Initiation Protocol is the Internet Engineering Task Force's
      standard for multimedia communications in an IP network. Authentication
      in SIP has been a major concern and most of the existing authentication
      mechanisms in SIP are dependent on public key infrastructure (PKI) or
      shared secrets (passwords).This document proposes new authentication
      schemes in SIP using identity-based signature and signcryption schemes.
      This approach provides security comparable to that of certificate-based
      authentication while preserving the operational simplicity of
      shared-secret techniques.

 Introduction</h3>

<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, RFC 3261 [1]) is an application
      layer control protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions
      between one or more user agents. SIP messages may be exposed to a
      variety of security threats and attacks. One important security issue
      faced by SIP is authenticating the identity of the sender of a SIP
      message. Current solutions are based on a variety of signature methods.
      The most common approach is to use a shared secret to digest the message
      using HTTP Digest Authentication, [15]. Another technique, called "SIP
      Identity" involves signing a fixed subset of the message using a
      certificate [19]. The certificate used for this signing may be the
      sender's or may belong to an identity service which has presumably used
      some other means to authenticate the sender. A primary constraint of
      this approach is that the recipient must posses (or be able to obtain)
      the public key component of that certificate in order to validate the
      signature. This requirement has presumably influenced the low adoption
      rate of the technique. A potential certificate discovery mechanism is
      proposed in [14].
</p>
<p>Another alternative is to apply a "signcryption" technique to
      selected elements of the message. The main goal of signcryption schemes
      is to provide authenticity and confidentiality in one logic. This also
      requires key management, but can be combined easily with identity-based
      cryptosystems, allowing end users can to generate public keys from a
      well-known identities. This document illustrates one approach for
      adapting SIP Identity [7] to take advantage of signcryption using
      identity based techniques. This document introduces the concept of
      Identity based cryptography in Section 2 , describes the key
      distribution process proposed by Byoungcheon Lee et al. in Section 2.2,
      describes Hess's algorithm which is used to generate the digital
      signature scheme in a single domain environment in Section 2.3,
      describes Gentry and Silverberg's algorithm for generating digital
      signatures a hierarchical domain environment in Section 2.5 , describes
      Lynn's signcryption scheme for generating a signcrypted message in a
      single domain environment in Section 2.4, and describes Chow et al 's
      signcryption scheme for a hierarchical domain environment 2.6. After
      establishing these basic techniques, the document then describes a
      procedure by which identity based authentication can be applied to SIP
      by extending the mechanism of RFC 4474 [7].

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>The concept of identity based cryptography was first proposed by
        Shamir in 1984 [18]. The basic idea behind an identity based
        cryptosystems is that end users can choose an arbitrary string
        (example: their email address or SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
        or IP address) which represents their identity to compute their public
        key. Thus they do not need digital certificates from a Certificate
        authority (CA). The private keys paired to the identity based public
        keys are distributed by some trusted third-party Private Key Generator
        (PKG). Figure 1 illustrates the key distribution process proposed by
        Byoungcheon Lee et al in the single domain environment [8]. </p>

                       Figure 1








</pre></div><p>
 Alice and Bob pick their secrets and compute their
        blinding factors. They then send a request for a partial private key
        to the domain's PKG along with the blinding factor. The credentials
        that the PKG would use to verify the authenticity of an end user's
        identity(Alice or Bob's identity) is outside the scope of this
        document. The PKG sends back their respective partial private keys and
        the end users generate their private keys from their secrets. An
        interceptor or an eavesdropper will not be able to generate the
        private key as he has no knowledge of the secret that was chosen by
        Alice or Bob. Hence there is a secure key exchange between the PKG and
        the end users. If Alice would want to authenticate herself to Bob,
        then she could either generate a digital signature using Hess's
        algorithm or a signcrypted message using Lynn's algorithm and then
        send it to Bob [9],[10]. Bob would use Alice's identity to generate
        her public key and then verify the digital signature or the
        signcrypted message. Signcrypted messages can only be verified by the
        intended recipient as he would use his own private key along with
        sender's public key to validate the ciphertext. Identity based
        authentication can be easily extended to a two level hierarchical
        domain environment. Figure 2 describes the key distribution process
        for a two level hierarchical system </p>

Key Distribution Using Byoungcheon Lee et al's algorithm </h3>

<p>Shamir constructed an Identity-Based Signature (IBS) scheme using
        the existing RSA function [19], but he was unable to construct an
        Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) scheme, which became a long lasting
        open problem [18]. Recently in 2001, Shamir's open problem was
        independently solved by Boneh and Franklin using the concept of
        bilinear maps [5]. Hence, it led to a new area of research where many
        identity based digital signature schemes were proposed using the
        concept of bilinear maps. Below is a brief review of the private key
        distribution process proposed by Byoungcheon Lee et al [8].
</p>
<p>Let H_1,H_2 and H_3 are three hash functions such that
</p>
<p>H_1 : {0, 1}^l--&gt;G_1 where l is the length of the plain
        text.
</p>
<p>H_2 : {0, 1}^l * G_2 --&gt; Z_q where Z_q = Z/qZ denotes integers
        mod q where q is a large prime. Therefore Z_q denotes the group {0, 1,
        2, .........., q -1} and (Z_q)^* = Z\{0}.
</p>
<p>H_3 : G_2 --&gt; (Z_q)^*
</p>
<p>The PKG specifies two groups G_1 and G_2 of order q, where G_1 is
        an additive group and G_2 is a multiplicative group and a bilinear map
        e : G_1 * G_1 --&gt; G_2 between the group which satisfies the
        following properties, </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Bilinear: Let x_1, x_2 and y belong to G_1. Then e(x_1 + x_2,
            y) = e(x_1, y).e(x_2, y)t
</li>
<li>Non-degenerate: There exists x belongs to G_1 and y belongs to
            G_1 such that e(x, y) NOT EQUAL 1
</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact G_1 will be a point subgroup on an elliptic curve over a
        finite field and G_2 is a subgroup of a cyclic group of a larger
        finite field. The pairings are derived from the Weil or Tate pairing
        [5].
</p>
<p>The PKG chooses a private key s_0 belong to Z*q and computes the
        master public key
</p>
<p>P_0 = s_0.P where P belong to G_1
</p>
<p>The security of the master public key is dependent on the elliptic
        curve discrete log problem [6]. It publishes the description of the
        groups G_1 and G_2, the bilinear map e,hash functions (H_1, H_2 and
        H_3), public key P_0 and the group element P .Alice with identity ID_A
        chooses a random secret x belong to Z*q and computes a blinding factor
        X = xP . She then requests the PKG to issue a partial private key by
        sending X and ID_A.
</p>
<p>The PKG then validates Alice's identity and computes the public key
        of Alice as
</p>
<p>Q_ID_A = H_1(ID_A)
</p>
<p>It computes a blinded partial private key as Q_bl_A = H_3[e(s_0X,
        P_0)]s_0Q_ID_A
</p>
<p>It then generates a signature Sig(Q_bl_A) for integrity protection.
        Sig(Q_bl_A) = soQ_bl_A
</p>
<p>It sends Sig(Q_bl_A) and Q_bl_A to Alice. Alice verifies the
        signature using the below mentioned formula, e(Sig(Q_bl_A), P ) ?=
        e(Q_bl_A , P_0)
</p>
<p>and finally retrieves her private key D_ID_A by unblinding Q_bl_A
        as follows D_ID_A = Q_bl_A H_3[e(P_0, P_0)x]

 Identity Based Authentication in SIP </h3>

<p>RFC 4474 [7] provides a model for signing a SIP request using
      conventional public-key techniques. The signature itself is carried in a
      header field called "Identity". A related header field called
      "Identity-Info" conveys supporting information, including a location
      from which the certficicate used to create the signature may be
      retrieved if the recipient does not yet have it. This document re-uses
      those header fields by following the extension sytnax of RFC 4474. The
      signed or singcrypted text is transmitted in the "Identity" header
      field, as in RFC 4474. The "Identity-Info" header field is extended to
      allow the recipient to discover that the signature being presented is
      identity-based and determine which algorithm was used in the
      calculation. The syntax as used in this document is believed to be
      slightly flawed but could be reasonably adapted for consistency with RFC
      4474. Note that the nature of the identity relationship here allows
      meaningful use of the Identity header in response messages as well as
      request messages. The "From" header field of each request encodes the
      identity used for message signing, and the "To" header field encodes the
      target identity used for signcryption (is signcryption is used) as well
      as the identity from which responses will be anticipated if this
      technique is used to protect messages sent in response. One open issue
      is whether there may be multiple root PKG namespaces potentially valid
      for a given domain. If so, then the "Identity-info" header field will
      need to encode a pointer into the PKG namespace.
</p>
<p>Let us consider the case where Alice belonging to example.com with a
      SIP URI sip:alice@example.com would want to authenticate herself to Bob
      (sip:bob@example.com). She would compute the digital signature using
      Hess's algorithm [described in section 2.3] or the signcrypted message
      using Lynn's algorithm [described in section 2.4]. The message m is
      calculated by hashing the SIP header fields of the INVITE message as
      recommended in RFC 4474 [7]. In case of a hierarchical domain
      environment Alice belonging to atlanta.com with a SIP URI
      (sip:alice@atlanta.com) would want to authenticate herself to Bob
      belonging to biloxi.com (sip:bob@biloxi.com).
</p>
<p>The following text includes several sample SIP messages signed using
      this technique. The first is an INVITE message with the digital
      signature generated using Hess's algorithm. The second uses a
      signcrypted header field generated using Lynn's algorithm in a single
      domain environment. The third sample is an INVITE message with a
      signature generated using Gentry and Silverberg's algorithm, and the
      fourth is showas a signcrypted headerfield generated using Chow's
      algorithm in a two level hierarchical domain environment. As with RFC
      4474, the contents of the Identity header field are encoded using the
      Base64 algorithm [21]. Although these sampel messages are all requests,
      the technique can be applied to responses, allowing recipient Bob to
      authenticate himself to Alice by inserting appropriate Identity and
      Identity-Info header fields into the response message 200 OK.

Performance of Identity Based Authentication in SIP </h3>

<p>The authentication mechanism discussed in this document allows the
      end users to directly authenticate each other. This scheme also reduces
      the burden on the SIP proxies as they need not play the role of an
      authenticator. We used the Pairing-based Cryptography Library [24] to
      generate the identity based signatures/signcryption schemes. We choose
      pairings of Type A curves because they are fast and are used where the
      main concern is efficiency. Type A pairings are constructed on the
      curves y^2 = x^3 + x over the field F_p where p is some prime. We choose
      the group order to be 160 bits and the order of the base field to be 512
      bits. RFC 4474 uses SHA1 hashing algorithm whose output size is 160 bits
      with RSA as their signing algorithm [7]. We used SHA256 hashing
      algorithm whose output size is 256 bits with signing algorithms that are
      dependent on elliptic curve cryptography. Table 1 compares the
      processing time to generate the digital signatures between our scheme
      and the scheme proposed by RFC 4474. Times for RFC 4474 were calculated
      using the OpenSSL library. All message parsing was done by hand.

<p>We observe a 28.44% decrease in the processing time in generating
      digital signatures when generated using Hess's algorithm and 14.66%
      decrease in the processing time when generated using Gentry and
      Silverberg's algorithm. We also observe a 53.63% decrease in the
      processing time in verifying the digital signatures when generated using
      Hess's algorithm and 42.72% decrease in the processing time when
      generated using Gentry and Silverberg's algorithm. While we observe an
      increase in processing time when compared to the signcryption schemes,
      but the signcryption schemes perform both authentication and encryption
      in one logic. In our scheme the end users need not append their X.509 v3
      certificates and hence there is a substantial amount (10 K bytes) of
      decrease in the payload

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
 Revocation in Identity Based Systems </h3>

<p>In case of PKI, the public key certificates contain a preset
      expiration date. If the validity date expires, or if the sender (caller)
      refreshes his private key, then the recipient (callee) would have to
      obtain a new certificate from a public key repository which would
      involve the onerous task of certificate path construction and path
      validation processes.
</p>
<p>But in case of Identity based encryption system the sender can
      generate a public key using the recipient's identity (SIP URI) along
      with the expiration date. If the date has expired, the recipient needs
      to obtain a new private key from the PKG. As a result the recipient
      would clearly by pass the tedious task of obtaining a new public key
      certificate from a public key repository.
</p>
<p>One could make this approach more granular by generating the public
      key using the recipient's identity along with the current date. In this
      case it would force the recipient to obtain a new private key every day.
      If the end user leaves the domain in which he was registered, the PKG is
      instructed to stop issuing private keys for that end user's SIP URI. As
      a result
</p>
<p>Bob can no longer prove his identity unless he obtains a new private
      key from the new domain's PKG. But, on of the most prominent features
      with IBE is that the sender need not communicate with any third party
      controlled certificate directory to obtain the recipient's public
      key.
</p>
<p>Alice could also generate a unique public key for Bob by
      concatenating Bob's SIP URI along with a Universally Unique Identifier
      (UUID) and then generate a digital signature or a signcrypted message
      [23]. Therefore if Bob wants to verify the signature or decrypt the
      signcrypted message, Bob would have to request a new partial private key
      from its domain's PKG.

Conclusion</h3>

<p>The advantages with the proposed methods are:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Key size: Elliptic-curve cryptography arguably provides
          equivalent security with smaller operands than the RSA technique
          typically used with [7]. This provides some advantage for
          resource-constrained environments such as mobile telephones. It also
          reduces the cryptographic load on large-scale devices doing frequent
          authentication checks.
</li>
<li>Key discovery: Callers can generate the public key of the callee
          from the identity (SIP URI) of the callee and vice versa. This
          eliminates a requirement for a key discovery mechanism using
          external sources, making deployment significantly easier.
</li>
<li>Certificate validation: As a result caller or callee need not go
          through the complex path construction process to retrieve the public
          keys of a chain of CAs from the public key depositories which are
          controlled by the respective CAs. This allows deployment in a
          peer-to-per modality without a need to route SIP messages through a
          centralized identity service or trust peer nodes to operate as
          identity services.
</li>
<li>Revocation: The ease of minting new identities and discovering
          keys allows short-lived identities, reducing the need for
          certificate revocation lists and the checking thereof. This offers
          very large operational advantages in resource constrained
          environments.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The primary disadvantage of the proposed method relates to the the
      single-root model of private key generation. There is, however, ongoing
      research on loosely-coupled heirarchical PKGs that should lead to the
      alleviation of this constraint. However, in the typical usage scenarios
      of single and confederated domains, the single-root model is not
      particularly disadvantageous.
</p>
<p>The proposed model seems to be especially well-suited for
      peer-to-peer SIP environments [ 13], wherein there are no "identity
      servers" or "trusted proxies" in the traditional sense. The enrollment
      process can include private key generation, allowing nodes to therafter
      operate securely using the methodology of this document.
