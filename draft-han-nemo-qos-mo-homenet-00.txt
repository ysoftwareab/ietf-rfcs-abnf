Abstract                                                                  
   
   Current NEMO enabled home network technology [1] does not support any kind 
   of inbuilt Quality of Service function. In case of various home network 
   situations, some of prioritized requests are supposed to be occurred under
   NEMO environment. This memo suggests additional processes for basis of 
   priority enabled home network under NEMO environment.

INTERNET-DRAFT	QoS Negotiation MO Headers for NEMO Home Network Model, 2006


1. Introduction

   Home Network technology connects all devices into one network in one¡¯s 
   house and provides accessibility of whole devices in the network through
   the internet by common method such as home network middleware. Recently,
   merging NEMO technology and home networking is perceived as a hot issue
   of IETF and new model related to it was selected as one of the drafts in
   IETF WG. Accessing the device in Home Network from remote location is 
   simply possible due to Mobile IP [2] or NEMO technique that can be easily 
   applied to Home Network. However, in some specific cases such as requiring
   communication priorities between MR and HA like users want to send an 
   urgent print job with receiving VoD data from their home network, current 
   NEMO basic support architecture [3] can not arrange all kinds of the 
   communication into descendant or ascendant order.
    In this document, we propose two Mobility Option headers [2] to support 
   priority enabled transmission between MR and HA on NEMO enabled home 
   network, especially, NEMO extended Home Network Model. Our approach 
   provides an basis for the priority negotiation process of further complex
   Quality of Service processes

3. Extensions

   We defined two new Mobility Option headers to exchange priority information
   between a MR and its respective HA. At first, priority requesters like
   MNNs [4] behind the MR or devices behind the HA will send the information.
   if the MR or the HA receives this information, they must send the signal
   for negotiation each other. after the negotiation, all kind of traffic
   between the MR and the HA can be arranged by themselves. this signal is
   the Mobility Option header carried by Mobility Headers in Mobile IPv6. 
   must exchange the priority level and the requestor¡¯s address, 

   (1) Priority Negotiation Request Mobility Option

   network for exchanging and transmitting the priority.

	<Fig. 1> Multicast Tree when MR starts up

    If the users would receive their data more quickly from designated 
   device when they locate behind the MR far from the home network, they 
	 can request the priority level to the MR through their system. This 
   means that one¡¯s equipments such as PDA, Notebook, etc, send the 
   request to the MR. If the MR and the HA, in the fig 1, received a request
   for a priority from their ingress network [5], they initiate the MO header
   for the negotiation signal and send it to their respective MR or HA.
   Afterwards, they receives the result of the negotiation.


5. Conclusion

   In this memo, we suggests two newly defined Mobility Option headers for
   prioity negotiation on home network enabled NEMO system. Using these
   Mobility Options, all communications can be separated into home network 
   communications and normal internet communications. That means some
   urgent traffic can be sent to the destination prior to the others and 
   normal outgoing/incoming traffic is not affected by our scheme.
 
    This study is a work in progress and need to be improved by any 
   other individual or commercial issues. Specially, this work can be 
   adopted on Next Generation Network's Killer Application such as 
   Mobile Video on Demand, etc. We will add security issue such as 
   Priroiry Negotiation Mechanism, etc. And also encourage people who 
   are interested in this work to contribute this work.
