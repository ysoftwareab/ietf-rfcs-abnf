Internet-Draft           Service Boundary Holes               March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The LoST protocol [RFC5222] maps service and locations to destination
   addresses.  A LoST server does this by provisioning boundary maps or
   areas against service URNs.  The boundary is a polygon made up of
   sets of geodetic coordinates specifying an enclosed area.  In some
   circumstances an area enclosed by a polygon, also known as an
   exterior polygon, may contain exception areas, or holes, that for the
   same service must yield a different destination to that described by
   the larger area.

   This document describes the RECOMMENDED approach to specifying holes
   in service boundaries defined using a GML encoding for the polygons
   and their internal elements (holes).

   This document describes a profile of Geographic Markup Language (GML)
   [ISO-19107] polygons that constrains their representation when used
   for describing service boundaries.

   The working group considered that the types of regions described in
   this memo could be represented in various ways as polygons without
   holes, but concluded on the recommendations here to avoid potential
   problems with the arbitrary division of regions and to align with
   existing geospatial system practices.

3.  Specifying Holes

   Holes related to an exterior boundary polygon MUST adhere to the
   following rules:

   Rule 1:   Two holes MUST NOT have more than one point of
             intersection.

   If two or more holes overlap or share a common boundary then these
   represent a single hole.  The internal elements (holes) should have
   common boundaries removed and a single hole created irrespective of
   whether the excluded area is itself made up of multiple service
   boundaries.

            Figure 2: Hole Specification with Boundary Sharing

   Rule 2:   A polygon MUST describe a contiguous region.

   If a hole overlaps with the outer boundary, or it shares part of a
   side with the outer boundary, then it has an inlet and it MUST be
   expressed without the hole.

   Similarly, a polygon that is enclosed entirely within a hole from
   another polygon (i.e., an "island") is a separate polygon.

   Rule 3:   A hole MUST be formed from a legal linear ring in
             accordance with [geoshape], except that points are
             specified in a clockwise direction.

   Holes are specified in clockwise direction so that the upward normal
   is opposed to the upward normal of the exterior boundary of the
   polygon.  Note that [geoshape] stipulates that exterior boundaries
   are specified in anti-clockwise order.

   There is no restriction on the number of points that are used to
   express the perimeter of either exterior or interior boundaries.

5.  Holes in GML Polygons

   A hole is specified in the polygon by defining an interior boundary.
   The points defining the internal boundary define the area represented
   by the hole in the primary (exterior) polygon.  The shaded area in
   Figure 7 is represented by the 4 points of the interior boundary
   specified by (w,z,y,x).

6.  Service Boundary Specification and Selection Algorithm

   A service boundary is represented by a polygon that may have many
   vertices.  The enclosed area of the polygon represents the area in
   which a service, expressed as a service URN, maps to a single URI.

   Figure 7 is used to illustrate two service boundaries.  The first
   service boundary A->F shall be referred to as area-A, and the second
   service boundary w->z shall be referred to as area-w.  Furthermore,
   area-A is directly represented by the GML encoding provided in
   Figure 7.  Area-w is represented as a hole in area-A by the interior
   boundary.  Since area-w is also a service boundary, a separate
   polygon describing this area is also required and is shown in
   Figure 8 (note the reversal of the vertices).

   <gml:Polygon srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
     <gml:exterior>
       <gml:LinearRing>
         <gml:pos>43.411 -73.322</gml:pos> <!--w-->

                 Figure 9: Service Boundary Specifications

   It is considered likely that LoST servers will need to provide
   responses sufficiently quickly to allow real-time queries to be
   performed as part of an emergency call routing flow.  It is for this
   reason that databases supporting native geospatial query techniques
   are desirable and that service boundary specifications that are
   easily mapped to internal data structures are preferred.  Using
   interior boundaries makes support for this operation easy, while
   allowing an arbitrary number of holes in a service boundary to be
   specified.

   Each polygon is stored in the geospatial database and mapped to a
   service URN and destination URI.  Many geospatial databases natively
   support polygons with interior exclusions.  Without native support,
   interior boundaries can be stored against the polygon and can checked
   separately.  A location falls within the area described by a polygon
   if it is within the exterior boundary and not within any interior
   boundary.

   In the above example, if a location falls within the interior
   boundary, it maps to the "Inner Area Police" service; likewise, if a
   location falls within the exterior boundary, but not within the
   interior boundary, it maps to the "Outer Area Police" service.

7.  Security Considerations

   Constraining the form of a polygon representation as described in
   this document does not introduce new security considerations.
