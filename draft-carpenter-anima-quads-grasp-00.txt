1.  Introduction

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model], the Autonomic Service
   Agent (ASA) is the atomic entity of an autonomic function, and it is
   instantiated on autonomic nodes.  When ASAs communicate with each
   other, they should use the Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol
   (GRASP) [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp].  It is essential that such
   communication is strongly secured to avoid malicious interference
   with the Autonomic Network Infrastructure (ANI).

   For this reason, GRASP must run over a secure substrate that is
   isolated from regular data plane traffic.  This substrate is known as
   the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP).  A method for constructing an ACP
   at the network layer is described in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane].  Scenarios for link layer
   ACPs are discussed in [I-D.carpenter-anima-l2acp-scenarios].  The
   present document describes a simple method of emulating an ACP
   immediately above the transport layer, known as QUADS (QUick And
   Dirty Security) for GRASP.

2.  Method

   Every GRASP message, whether unicast or multicast, is encrypted
   immediately before transmission, and decrypted immediately after
   reception, using the same symmetric encryption algorithm and domain-
   wide shared keys.  This applies to all unicast and multicast messages
   sent over either UDP or TCP.  Typically encryption will take place
   immediately after a message is encoded as CBOR [RFC7049], and
   decryption will take place immediately before a message is decoded
   from CBOR.

   There is no attempt to specify an automatic algorithm choice or key
   distribution mechanism.  Every instance of GRASP in a given Autonomic

   Network (AN) must be pre-configured with the choice of encryption
   algorithm and any necessary parameters, and with the same key(s).

   An alternative to configuring the keys is that every instance of
   GRASP is pre-configured with a fixed salt value and the keys are
   created from a locally chosen domain password, using a pre-defined
   hash algorithm and that salt value.  Note that the salt value cannot
   be secret as it must be the same in all QUADS for all GRASP
   implementations.  In this model the secrecy depends on the password.

   The choice of algorithms should follow best current practice, e.g.
   [RFC8221].

3.  Implementation Status [RFC Editor: please remove]

   QUADS for GRASP has been implemented as a small extension to the
   Python GRASP prototype, using the Python 'cryptography' module.  The
   algorithm choices were:

   Encryption: AES/CBC, key lengths 32/16, padding PKCS7(128).

   Password hash: PBKDF2HMAC SHA256, length 32, 100000 iterations.

   Salt used for password hash: 0xf474526a2e74accee189f1fbc1c34ceb.

   The code will be posted to https://github.com/becarpenter/graspy when
   stable.

4.  Security Considerations

   QUADS provides effective secrecy for all GRASP messages, against any
   party not in possession of the relevant shared keys.  However, before
   a GRASP message is encrypted or after it is decrypted, it is not
   protected within the host.  Therefore, secrecy is only effective
   against nodes that do not contain a GRASP instance in possession of
   the keys.  Those nodes cannot send valid GRASP messages, and they
   cannot interpret intercepted GRASP messages, including multicasts.
   However, they might attempt traffic analysis.

   QUADS provides authentication of GRASP instances to the extent that
   they must be in possession of the relevant shared keys.

   QUADS depends on manual configuration of keys, or on password entry,
   for each autonomic node.

   QUADS offers no defence against denial of service attacks.
