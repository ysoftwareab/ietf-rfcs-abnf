                      draft-vyncke-v6ops-james-00

Abstract

   In 2016, [RFC7872] has measured the drop of packets with IPv6
   extension headers.  This document presents a slightly different
   methodology with more recent results.  It is still work in progress.

1.  Introduction

   In 2016, [RFC7872] has measured the drop of packets with IPv6
   extension headers on their transit over the global Internet.  This
   document presents a slightly different methodology with more recent
   results.  Since then, [I-D.draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering] has
   provided some recommendations for filtering transit traffic, there
   may be some changes in providers policies.

Internet-Draft                    JAMES                       March 2022


   It is still work in progress, but the authors wanted to present some
   results at IETF-113 (March 2022).

2.  Methodology

   In a first phase, the measurement is done between collaborating IPv6
   nodes, a.k.a. vantage points, spread over the Internet and multiple
   Autonomous Systems (ASs).  As seen in Section 3.1.1, the
   source/destination/transit ASs include some "tier-1" providers per
   [TIER1], so, they are probably representative of the global Internet
   core.

   Relying on collaborating nodes has some benefits:

   *  propagation can be measured even in the absence of any ICMP
      message or reply generated by the destination;

   *  traffic timing can be measured accurately to answer whether
      extension headers are slower than plain IP6 packets;

   *  traffic can be captured into .pcap [I-D.draft-ietf-opsawg-pcap]
      file at the source and at the destination for later analysis.

   Future phases will send probes to non-collaborating nodes with a much
   reduced probing speed.  The destination will include [ALEXA] top-n
   websites, popular CDN, as well as random prefix from the IPv6 global
   routing table.  A revision of this IETF draft will describe those
   experiments.

3.  Measurements

3.1.  Vantage Points

   Several servers were used worldwide (albeit missing Africa and China
   as authors were unable to find IPv6 servers in these regions).
   Table 1 lists all the vantage points together with their AS number
   and country.

   The table attributes some tier qualification to some ASs based on the
   Wikipedia page [TIER1], but there is no common way to decide who is a
   tier-1.  Based on some CAIDA research, all the above (except GO6,
   which is a stub network) are transit providers.

   While this document lists some operators, the intent is not to build
   a wall of fame or a wall of shame but more to get an idea about which
   kind of providers drop packets with extension headers and how
   widespread the drop policy is enforced and where, i.e., in the access
   provider or in the core of the Internet.

3.1.2.  Tested Extension Headers

   In the first phase among collaborating vantage points, packets always
   contained either a UDP payload or a TCP payload, the latter is sent
   with only the SYN flag set and with data as permitted by section 3.4
   of [RFC793] (2nd paragraph).  A usual traceroute is done with only
   the UDP/TCP payload without any extension header with varying hop-
   limit in order to learn the traversed routers and ASs.  Then, several
   UDP/TCP probes are sent with a set of extension headers:

   *  hop-by-hop and destination options header containing:

      -  one PadN option for an extension header length of 8 octets,

      -  one unknown option with the "discard" bits for an extension
         header length of 8 octets,

      -  several PaDN options for an extension header length of 256
         octets,

      -  one unknown option (two sets with "discard" and "skip" bits)
         for an extension header length of 256 octets,

      -  one unknown option (two sets with "discard" and "skip" bits)
         for an extension header length of 512 octets.

   *  routing header with routing types from 0 to 6 inclusive (except
      for type 3);

   *  atomic fragment header (i.e., M-flag = 0 and offset = 0) of
      varying frame length 512, 1280, and 1500 octets;

   *  non-atomic first fragment header (i.e., M-flag = 1 and offset = 0)
      of varying frame length 512, 1280, and 1500 octets;

   *  authentication header with dummy SPI followed by UDP/TCP header
      and a 38 octets payload.

Internet-Draft                    JAMES                       March 2022


   In the above, length is the length of the extension header itself
   except for the fragmentation header where the length is the IP packet
   length (i.e., including the IPv6, and TCP/UDP headers + payload).

   For hop-by-hop and destination options headers, when required
   multiple PadN options were used in order to bypass some Linux kernels
   that consider a PadN larger than 8 bytes is an attack, see section
   5.3 of [BCP220], even if multiple PadN options violates section
   2.1.9.5 of [RFC4942].

   Next phases will also include packets without UDP/TCP transport
   header but with Next-Header being:

   *  59, "no next header" see section 4.7 of [RFC8200];

   *  143, "ethernet" see section 4.9 of [RFC8986].

3.1.3.  Drop attribution to AS

   Comparing the traceroutes with and without extension headers allows
   the attribution of a packet drop to one AS.  But, this is not an easy
   task as inter-AS links often use IPv6 address of only one AS (if not
   using link-local per [RFC7704]).  This document uses the following
   algorithm to attribute the drop to one AS for packet sourced in one
   AS and then having a path traversing AS#foo just before AS#bar:

   *  if the packet drop happens at the first router (i.e., hop limit ==
      1 does not trigger an ICMP hop-limit exceeded), then the drop is
      assumed to this AS as it is probably an ingress filter on the
      first router (i.e., the hosting provider in most of the cases -
      except if collocated with an IXP).

   *  if the packet drop happens in AS#foo after one or more hop(s) in
      AS#bar, then the drop is assumed to be in AS#foo ingress filter on
      a router with an interface address in AS#foo

   *  if the packet drop happens in AS#bar after one or more hop(s) in
      AS#bar before going to AS#foo, then the drop is assumed to be in
      AS#foo ingress filter on a router with an interface address in
      AS#bar

Internet-Draft                    JAMES                       March 2022


   In several cases, the above algorithm was not possible (e.g., some
   intermediate routers do not generate an ICMP unreachable hop limit
   exceeded even in the absence of any extension headers), then the drop
   is not attributed.  Please also note that the goal of this document
   is not to 'point fingers to operators' but more to evaluate the
   potential impact.  I.e., a tier-1 provider dropping packets with
   extension headers has a much bigger impact on the Internet traffic
   than an access provider.

   Future revision of this document will use the work of [MLAT_PEERING].

3.2.  Results

   This section presents the current results out of phase 1
   (collaborating vantage points) testing.  About 4860 experiments were
   run, one experiment being defined by sending packets between 2
   vantage points with hop-limit varying from 1 to the number of hops
   between the two vantage points and for all the extension headers
   described in Section 3.1.2.

3.2.1.  Routing Header

   The following table lists all routing header types and the percentage
   of experiments that were successful, i.e., packets with routing
   header reaching their destination:

    +=====================+===========================================+

   The table below lists the few ASs that drop packets with the routing
   header type 0 (the original source routing header, which is now
   deprecated).

                      +===========+================+
                      | AS Number | AS description |

                      +-----------+----------------+

                                 Table 4

   It is possibly due to a strict implementation of [RFC5095] but it is
   expected that no packet with routing header type 0 would be
   transmitted anymore.  So, this is not surprising.

   The table below lists the few ASs that drop packets with the routing
   header type 4 (Segment Routing Header [RFC8754]).

                      +===========+================+
                      | AS Number | AS description |

                      +-----------+----------------+

                                 Table 5

   This drop of SRH was to be expected as SRv6 is specified to run only
   in a limited domain.

   Other routing header types (1 == deprecated NIMROD [RFC1753], 2 ==
   mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], and even 5 == CRH-16 and 6 == CRH-
   32[I-D.draft-bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr]) can be transmitted over the
   global Internet without being dropped (assuming that the 0.5% of
   dropped packets are within the measurement error).

3.2.2.  Hop-by-Hop Options Headers

   Many ASs drop packets containing either hop-by-hop options headers
   per table below:

                                  Table 6

   It appears that hop-by-hop options headers cannot reliably traverse
   the global Internet; only small headers with 'skippable' options have
   some chances.  If the hop-by-hop option has the 'discard' bits, it is
   dropped per specification.

3.2.3.  Destination Options Headers

   Many ASs drop packets containing destination options headers per
   table below:

             +========+===============+======================+
             | Length | Multiple PadN | %-age of experiments |

             | 512    | No            | 2.6%                 |
             +--------+---------------+----------------------+

   The measurement did not find any impact of the discard/skip bits in
   the destination headers options, probably because the routers do not
   look inside the extension headers into the options.  The use of a
   single large PadN or multiple 8-octet PadN options does not influence
   the result.

3.2.4.  Fragmentation Header

   The propagation of two kinds of fragmentation headers was analysed:
   atomic fragment (offset == 0 and M-flag == 0) and plain first
   fragment (offset == 0 and M-flag == 1).  The table below displays the
   propagation differences.

        +============+===========================================+
        | M-flag     | %-age of experiments reaching destination |
        +============+===========================================+
        | 0 (atomic) | 70.2%                                     |
        +------------+-------------------------------------------+
        | 1          | 99.0%                                     |
        +------------+-------------------------------------------+

                                 Table 8

   The size of the overall IP packets (512, 1280, and 1500 octets) does
   not have any impact on the propagation.

3.2.5.  No drop at all

   Finally, some ASs do not drop transit traffic (except for routing
   header type 0) and follow the recommendations of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering].  This list includes tier-1
   transit providers (using the "regional" tag per [TIER1]):

3.3.  Summary of the collaborating parties measurements

   While the analysis has areas of improvement (geographical
   distribution and impact on latency), it appears that:

   *  authentication and non-atomic fragmentation headers can traverse
      the Internet;

   *  only routing headers types 0 and 4 experiment problems over the
      Internet, other types have no problems;

   *  hop-by-hop options headers do not traverse the Internet;

   *  destination options headers are not reliable enough especially
      large size ones.

   Of course, the next phase of measurement with non-collaborating
   parties will probably give another view.

4.  Security Considerations

   While active probing of the Internet may be considered as an attack,
   this measurement was done among collaborating parties and using the
   probe attribution technique described in
   [I-D.draft-vyncke-opsec-probe-attribution].
