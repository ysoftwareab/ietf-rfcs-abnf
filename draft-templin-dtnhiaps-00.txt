Delay Tolerant Networking Header Integrity Assurance - Problem Statement
                     draft-templin-dtnhiaps-00.txt

Abstract

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model
   for environments in which communications may be subject to long
   delays and/or intermittent connectivity.  A Bundle Protocol (BP) has
   been designed to accommodate data communications in such challenging
   environments through multi-hop store-and-forward message propagation,
   where each hop may be required to store bundles of data for long
   periods of time.  It is therefore essential that bundles with
   corrupted headers (e.g., the primary bundle block) be detected as
   soon as possible in order to avoid resource exhaustion due to
   accidental or malicious factors, and to permit timely retransmission.
   In this document, we discuss the need for a hop-by-hop integrity
   assurance as a means for encouraging suitable solutions.

1.  Introduction

   The Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) architecture [RFC4838]
   introduces a data communications concept in which "bundles" of data
   are exchanged in store-and-forward fashion between endpoints that may
   be separated by long-delay or intermittently-connected paths.  The
   Bundle Protocol (BP) Specification [RFC5050] provides the bundle
   message format and operations, including convergence layer
   transmission, fragmentation and custody transfer.  Each bundle
   further may include extensions, among which may be security
   parameters designed to ensure confidentiality, integrity and
   authorization per the Bundle Security Protocol (BSP) [RFC6257] and/or
   Streamlined Bundle Security Protocol (SBSP) [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-sbsp]
   specifications.

   [WOOD08], Section 4.1 has shown that including integrity checks only
   between the original source and final destination can lead to poor
   performance when primary bundle blocks are corrupted on intermediate
   hops on the path (where the source of corruption may be accidental or
   through the malicious acts of an attacker).  Conversely, [WOOD08]
   establishes that adding a hop-by-hop integrity check can provide a
   tighter control loop resulting in faster retransmissions and more
   timely delivery of bundles to the final destination.  In the
   following section, we discuss the problem as a means for encouraging
   solution proposals.


2.  Discussion

   Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4) [RFC0791] includes a checksum in
   the header of each packet as a weak assurance against mis-delivery or
   corruption of critical protocol control fields.  The checksum is
   verified then recalculated at each hop along the path from source to
   destination, and the packet is discarded at any hop where the
   checksum is incorrect.  Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) [RFC2460]
   does not include a header checksum, but requires upper layer
   protocols (TCP, UDP, etc,) to include a "pseudo-header" of the IPv6
   header when calculating their checksum values.  This means that an
   IPv6 packet with header corruption may traverse many networking hops
   and may even arrive at the final destination before the corruption is
   detected.

   The DTN protocols currently adhere to the example established by
   IPv6, but differ in the sense that for a transport layer connection
   spanning a single Internet the end-to-end delay is typically only a
   few tens to a few hundreds of milliseconds where for a DTN path
   connecting multiple Internets the delay may be substantially longer.

   Since the continued store-and-forward progression of corrupted
   primary bundle block information needlessly consumes resources, and
   since the DTN protocols are typically associated with resource-
   constrained environments, it is critical that some form of hop-by-hop
   integrity solution be incorporated.  This could come in the form of a
   security protocol integrity block signed with a key that is known to
   all DTN nodes.  At a minimum, the integrity check should cover the
   primary bundle block but may or may not be applied to the payload
   since in some cases delivery of partially-corrupted data is deemed
   acceptable and better than getting no data at all.

   Therefore, a hop-by-hop integrity capability should be included in
   the DTN security protocols and applied as a matter of course in many
   DTN environments.  However, it is worth examining each DTN use case
   individually to determine where an integrity check is necessary vs
   where the check can be avoided.  This document does not suggest an
   approach to address the issue, but rather outlines the problems and
   invites solution proposals.


3.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


4.  Security Considerations

   Message integrity is an integral aspect of security, since corruption
   may occur either as an accident or through the purposeful actions of
   an adversary.

   DTN security considerations are discussed in
   [RFC6257][I-D.irtf-dtnrg-sbsp].


5.  Acknowledgments

   Integrity issues have been discussed broadly in DTN mailing list
   discussions as well as in many of the documents cited in this
   publication.
