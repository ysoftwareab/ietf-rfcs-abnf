Internet-Draft                 IPv6 in IXP                  January 2009


1.  Introduction

   Most Internet Exchange Points (IXP) work on the Layer 2 level, making
   the adoption of IPv6 an easy task.  However, IXPs normally implement
   additional services such as statistics, route servers, looking
   glasses, broadcast control and others that may be impacted by the
   implementation of IPv6.  This document gives guidance on the impact
   of IPv6 on a new or an existing IXP that may or may not fit any
   particular deployment.  The document assumes an Ethernet switch
   fabric, although other layer 2 canfigurations can be deployed.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


2.  Switch Fabric Configuration

   An Ethernet based IXP switching fabric implements IPv6 over Ethernet
   as described in RFC 2464 [RFC2464], therefore the switching of IPv6
   traffic happens in the same way as in IPv4.  However, some management
   functions require explicit IPv6 support.  Such functionalities may
   include: switch management, SNMP support and flow analysis tools.

   There are two common configurations of IXP switch ports to support
   IPv6:

   1.  dual stack VLAN: both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic share a common VLAN.
       No extra configuration is required in the switch.  Typically
       participants will configure dual stack interfaces in this
       scenario but independent port can be an option.

   2.  independent VLAN: an IPv6 VLAN is created for IPv6 traffic.  If
       IXP participants are already using VLAN tagging on the interfaces
       of their routers which face the IXP switch, this only requires
       configuring one additional VLAN tag across the interconnection.
       If participants are using untagged interconnections with the IXP
       switch and wish to continue doing so, they will need to use a
       separate physical port to access the IPv6-specific VLAN.

   The "independent VLAN" configuration provides a physical separation
   for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic simplifying the separated analysis for IPv4
   and IPv6 traffic.However, it can be more costly in both capital
   expenses (if new ports are needed) and operational expends.

Internet-Draft                 IPv6 in IXP                  January 2009


   The "dual stack" configuration allows a quick and cost-free start-up
   for IPv6 support in the IXP.  It also avoids transforming untagged
   ports into tagged ports.  Traffic split for statistical analysis may
   be done using flows techniques such as in IPFIX [RFC5101] considering
   the different ether-types (0x0800 for IPv4 and 0x86DD for IPv6).

   The support for jumbo frames MTU should be evaluated.  The only
   technical requirement for IPv6 referring link MTUs is that it needs
   to be greater than or equal to 1280 octets [RFC2460].  Most IXPs
   support MTUs of 1500, 4470, or 9216 bytes, so this typically requires
   no change of configuration.


3.  Addressing Plan

   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have specific address policies to
   allocate Provider Independent (PI) IPv6 address to IXPs.  Those
   allocations are usually /48 prefixes [RIR_IXP_POLICIES].  Depending
   on the country and region of operation, address allocations may be
   provided by NIRs (National Internet Registries).

   From the allocated prefix, following the recommendations of RFC 4291
   [RFC4291], a /64 prefix should be allocated for each of the exchange
   point Local Area Networks (LANs).  A /48 prefix allows the addressing
   of 65536 LANs.  Longer prefixes (/65-/127), are technically feasible
   using static address configuration, but should be avoided, in order
   to keep EUI-64 compatibility.

   The common practice for Interface Identifiers (IID) configuration is
   to use static configuration, disallowing auto-configuration on every
   interface.  Also, on a LAN where all its participants are typically
   routers, it is important that every node has it's router
   advertisement messages RFC 4861 [RFC4861] turned off.  The goal is
   that none of the remaining routers configure it-selves a default
   ICMPv6 route by accident.  A scanning device can be set up at the IXP
   LANs to monitor link-local multicast traffic (addresses ff02::/16),
   allowing only ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement
   messages and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) if multicast peering
   is permited in any particular VLAN.

   When selecting the use of static IIDs, there are different options on
   how to "intelligently" fill its 64 bits (or 16 hexadecimal
   characters) in order to help both IXPs and paricipants network
   operations.  A non exhausted list of possible IID selection
   mechanisms follows:

Internet-Draft                 IPv6 in IXP                  January 2009


   1.  Some IXPs like to include the participants' ASN number decimal
       encoding inside each IPv6 address.  The ASN decimal number number
       is used as the BCD (binary code decimal) encoding of the upper
       part of the IID such as shown in this example:

       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:DB8::/64

       *  ASN: 64496

       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:DB8::6449:6000:0000:0001/64 or its
          equivalent representation 2001:DB8::6449:6000:0:1/64

       In this representation each ASN may require a maximum of 10
       characters, as 16 characters are available, up to 2^24 IPv6
       addresses can be configured per ASN.

   2.  Although BCD encoding is more "human-readable", some IXPs prefer
       to use the hexadecimal encoding of the ASNs number as the upper
       part of the IID as follow:

       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:DB8::/64

       *  ASN: 64496 (DEC) or FBF0 (HEX)

       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:DB8::0000:FBF0:0000:0001/64 or its
          equivalent representation 2001:DB8::FBF0:0:1/64

       In this representation each ASN may require a maximum of 8
       characters, as 16 characters are available, up to 2^32 IPv6
       addresses can be configured per ASN.

   3.  A third scheme for statically assigning IPv6 addresses on an IXP
       LAN could be to relate some portion of a participant's IPv6
       address to its correspondant IPv4 address.  In the following
       example, the last three decimals of the IPv4 address are copied
       to the last hexadecimals of the IPv6 address, using the decimal
       number as the BCD encoding for the last three characters of the
       IID such as in the following example:

       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:DB8::/64

       *  IPv4 Address: 240.0.20.132/23

       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:DB8::132/64

   4.  A fourth configutation might be based on the IXPs ID for that
       participant.

Internet-Draft                 IPv6 in IXP                  January 2009


   The current practice that applies to IPv4 about publishing IXP
   allocations to the DFZ (Default Free Zone) should also apply to the
   IPv6 allocation (normally a /48 prefix).  IXP external services (such
   as dns, web pages, ftp servers) could be part of this prefix.


4.  Reverse DNS

   PTR records for all addresses assigned to participants should be
   included in the IXP reverse zone under "ip6.arpa".


5.  Route Server Configuration

   Some IXPs may offer a Route Server service, either for Multi-Lateral
   (ML) Peering Agreements or for a looking glass service.  IPv6 support
   needs to be added to the router used as BGP end point.  The equipment
   should be able to transport IPv6 traffic and to support Multi-
   protocol BGP (MP-BGP) extensions for IPv6 address family (RFC 2545
   [RFC2545] and RFC 4760 [RFC4760]).

   A good practice is to have IPv6 SAFI (Subsequent Address Family
   Identifiers) information carried over sessions established also on
   top of the IPv6 IP/TCP stack and independently of the IPv4 sessions.
   This configuration allows that in the event of IPv6 reachability
   issues to any IPv6 peer, the specific session will be turned down and
   the IPv4 session to the same peer will not be affected.  Please
   consider the use of MD5 (even better IPSEC) to authenticate the BGP
   sessions.

   The Router-Server or Looking Glass external service should be
   available for external IPv6 access, either by an IPv6 enabled web
   page or an IPv6 enabled console server.


6.  Internal and External Services support

   Some external services that need to have IPv6 support are Traffic
   Graphics, DNS, FTP, Web and Looking Glass.  Other external services
   such as NTP servers, or SIP Gateways need to be evaluated as well.
   In general, each service that is accessed through IPv4 or that handle
   IPv4 addresses should be compatible with IPv6.

   Internal services are also important when considering IPv6 adoption
   at an IXP.  Such services may not deal with IPv6 traffic but may
   handle IPv6 addresses; that is the case of provisioning systems,
   logging tools and statistics analysis tools.  Databases and tools
   needs to be evaluated to determinate its IPv6 support level.

7.  IXP Policies and IPv6

   IXP Policies may need to be revised as any mention of IP should be
   clarified if it refers to IPv4, IPv6 or both.  The current
   interpretation is that IP refers to the Internet Protocol,
   independently of the its version (i.e. both IPv4 and IPv6).  In any
   case contracts and policies should be reviewed for any occurrence of
   IP and/or IPv4 and replace it with the appropriate IP, IPv4 and/or
   IPv6 language.


8.  Multicast IPv6

   Multicast IPv6 is not different from an IXP perspective than
   Multicast IPv4.  The IXP may decide to use a reserved VLAN for
   Multicast traffic or to exchange that traffic in the same VLAN as the
   unicast traffic.  Link-local multicast traffic should be monitored as
   this traffic should be reduced to ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery RFC 4861
   [RFC4861] and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) Protocol (MLDv2) RFC
   3810 [RFC3810].
