 Extensions to BGP Signaled Pseudowires to support Flow-Aware Transport
                                 Labels
                   draft-ietf-bess-fat-pw-bgp-00.txt

Abstract

   [RFC6391] describes a mechanism that uses an additional label (Flow
   Label) in the MPLS label stack that allows Label Switch Routers to
   balance flows within Pseudowires at a finer granularity than the
   individual Pseudowires across the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs)
   that exists within the Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   Furthermore,[RFC6391] defines the LDP protocol extensions required to
   synchronize the flow label states between the ingress and egress PEs
   when using the signaling procedures defined in the [RFC4447].

   This draft defines protocol extensions required to synchronize flow
   label states among PEs when using the BGP-based signaling procedures
   defined in [RFC4761].  These protocol extensions are equally
   applicable to point-to-point L2VPNs defined in [RFC6624].

1.  Introduction

   A pseudowire (PW)[RFC3985] is normally transported over one single
   network path, even if multiple Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs)
   exist between the ingress and egress PW provider edge (PE) equipment.
   This is required to preserve the characteristics of the emulated

   service.  The use of a single path to preserve the packet delivery
   order remains the default mode of operation of a PW and is described
   in [RFC4385], [RFC4928].

   Using the principles defined in [RFC6391], this draft augments the
   BGP-signaling procedures of [RFC4761] and [RFC6624] to allow an
   OPTIONAL mode that may be employed when the use of ECMPs is known to
   be beneficial to the operation of the PW.

   High bandwidth Ethernet-based services are a prime example that
   benefits from the ability to load-balance flows in a PW over multiple
   PSN paths.  In general, load-balancing is applicable when the PW
   attachment circuit bandwidth and PSN core link bandwidth are of same
   order of magnitude.

   To achieve the load-balancing goal,[RFC6391] introduces the notion of
   an additional Label Stack Entry (LSE) (Flow label) located at the
   bottom of the stack (right after PW LSE).  Label Switching Routers
   (LSRs) commonly generate a hash of the label stack in order to
   discriminate and distribute flows over available ECMPs.  The presence
   of the Flow label (closely associated to a flow determined by the
   ingress PE) will normally provide the greatest entropy.

   Furthermore, following the procedures for Inter-AS scenarios
   described in [RFC4761] section 3.4, the Flow label should never be
   handled by the ASBRs, only the terminating PEs on each AS will be
   responsible for popping or pushing this label.  This is equally
   applicable to Method B [section 3.4.2] of [RFC4761] where ASBRs are
   responsible for swapping the PW label as traffic traverses from ASBR
   to PE and ASBR to ASBR directions.  Therefore, the Flow label will
   remain untouched across AS boundaries.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Modifications to Layer 2 Info Extended Community

   The Layer 2 Info Extended Community is used to signal control
   information about the pseudowires to be setup.  The extended
   community format is described in [RFC4761].  The format of this
   extended community is described as:

   With Reference to the Control Flags Bit Vector, the following bits in

   Extended Community.

         Z   Must be set to Zero.

         T   When the bit value is 1, the PE is requesting the ability
             to send a Pseudowire packet that includes a flow label.
             When the bit value is 0, the PE is indicating that it will
             not send a Pseudowire packet containing a flow label.

         R   When the bit value is 1, the PE is able to receive a
             Pseudowire packet with a flow label present. When the bit
             value is 0, the PE is unable to receive a Pseudowire packet
             with the flow label present.

3.  Signaling the Presence of the Flow Label

   As part of the Pseudowire signaling procedures described in
   [RFC4761], a Layer 2 Info Extended Community is advertised in the
   VPLS BGP NLRI.  This draft recommends that the Control Flags field of
   this extended community be used to synchronize the flow label states
   amongst PEs for a given L2VPN.

   A PE that wishes to send a flow label in a Pseudowire packet MUST
   include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer 2 Info Extended Community using
   Control Flags field with T = 1.

   A PE that is willing to receive a flow label in a Pseudowire packet
   MUST include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer 2 Info Extended Community
   using Control Flags field with R = 1.

   A PE that receives a VPLS BGP NLRI containing a Layer 2 Info Extended
   Community with R = 0 NUST NOT include a flow label in the Pseudowire
   packet.

   Therefore, a PE sending a Control Flags field with T = 1 and
   receiving a Control Flags field with R = 1 MUST include a flow label
   in the Pseudowire packet.  Under all other combinations, a PE MUST
   NOT include a flow label in the Pseudowire packet.

   A PE MAY support the configuration of the flow label (T and R bits)
   on a per-service (e.g.  VPLS VFI) basis.  Furthermore, it is also
   possible that on a given service, PEs may not share the same flow
   label settings.  The presence of a flow label is therefore determined
   on a per-peer basis and according to the local and remote T and R bit
   values.  For example, a PE part of a VPLS and with a local T = 1,
   must only transmit traffic with a flow label to those peers that
   signaled R = 1.  And if the same PE has local R = 1, it must only
   expect to receive traffic with a flow label from peers with T = 1.
   Any other traffic MUST not have a flow label.

   Modification of flow label settings may impact traffic over a PW as
   these could trigger changes in the PEs data-plane programming (i.e.
   imposition / disposition of flow label).  This is an implementation
   specific behavior and outside the scope of this draft

   The signaling procedures in [RFC4761] state that the unspecified bits
   in the Control Flags field (bits 0-5) MUST be set to zero when
   sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.  The signaling procedure
   described here is therefore backwards compatible with existing
   implementations.  A PE not supporting the extensions described in
   this draft will always advertise a value of ZERO in the position
   assigned by this draft to the R bit and therefore a flow label will

Internet-DraftExtensions to BGP Signaled PWs for FAT Labels    July 2015


   never be included in a packet sent to it by one of its peers.
   Similarly, it will always advertise a value of ZERO in the position
   assigned by this draft to the T bit and therefore a peer will know
   that a flow label will never be included in a packet sent by it.

   Note that what is signaled is the desire to include the flow LSE in
   the label stack.  The value of the flow label is a local matter for
   the ingress PE, and the label value itself is not signaled.
