1.  Introduction

   [RFC1034] and [RFC4592] described wildcard domain name.

   Nowadays wildcard domain is globally used, especially on CDN, P2P,
   advertise, anti-virus, DNSBLs service.

   Take "*.github.io" for example,

   foo.github.io.        3599  IN  CNAME   github.map.fastly.net.
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A       151.101.0.133
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A       151.101.192.133
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A       151.101.64.133
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A       151.101.128.133

   Wildcard domain is simple configured on Authoritative Nameserver, but
   Intermediate Nameservers have to cache various domains
   (xxx.github.io, yyy.github.io, ... ) of the same wildcard domain
   configuration.

   Moreover, [DNSNoise] found that many of wildcard domains are
   disposable (short live time), but with low cache hit rate, increase
   cache size.

   This document specifies a new SWILD RR type for Intermediate
   Nameservers to cache subdomain wildcard record, in order to reduce
   the cache size and optimize the wildcard domain cache miss.

   It is OPT-IN, Intermediate Nameservers can choose not to implement or
   enable it.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC4592], [RFC7719], [RFC7871] and [RFC8020].

   Authoritative Nameserver: Described in [RFC1035] Section 6.

   Intermediate Nameserver: Described in [RFC7871] Section 4.

   Recursive Resolver: Described in [RFC1035] Section 7.

   Forwarding Resolver: Described in [RFC2308] Section 1.

3.  The SWILD Resource Record

   The presentation format of the SWILD RR is as follows:

      owner ttl class SWILD target

   The "target" is a subdomain of the owner, to indicate that all
   subdomains of the "owner" have the same configuration with the
   "target".

4.  Overview

   We use a special character "_" to indicate the wildcard domain
   configuration on Intermediate Nameservers, make all the subdomains
   CNAME to the "_" subdomain, and generate a SWILD RR "_".

   If most of Recursive Resolvers support SWILD RR in the future, "_"
   special character is not strictly used for SWILD target.

   Take "*.foo.com" for example.

4.1.  Authoritative Nameserver

   Authoritative Nameserver configures the zonefile of "foo.com":

   o  add SWILD RR "_" to indicate subdomain wildcard.

   o  configure "_.foo.com".

Internet-DraSWILD RR Type (Wildcard on Intermediate Nameserve  July 2017


   o  make "*.foo.com" CNAME to "_.foo.com".

   Note that, there is not any other subdomain configured in the
   "foo.com" zone except "_.foo.com".

   $ORIGIN  foo.com.

   @    86400  IN   SWILD  _
   _     3600  IN   CNAME  map.bar.net.
   *      600  IN   CNAME  _

4.2.  Intermediate Nameserver: Recursive Resolver

4.2.1.  Recursive Resolvers that support SWILD RR

   Recursive Resolver sends "xxx.foo.com" A RR query to Authoritative
   Nameserver, get subdomain wildcard response:

   xxx.foo.com.    600     IN  CNAME   _.foo.com.
   _.foo.com.     3600     IN  CNAME   map.bar.net.
   map.bar.net.    600     IN  A       202.38.64.10
   foo.com.      86400     IN  SWILD   _.foo.com.

   Recursive Resolver knows that SWILD RR is for wildcard domain on
   recursive side, marks "_.foo.com" as wildcard domains of "*.foo.com".

   In TTL time, if Recursive Resolver receives a "yyy.foo.com" A RR
   query, it can directly return this subdomain wildcard response:

   yyy.foo.com.    600     IN  CNAME   _.foo.com.
   _.foo.com.     3600     IN  CNAME   map.bar.net.
   map.bar.net.    600     IN  A       202.38.64.10
   foo.com.      86400     IN  SWILD   _.foo.com.

4.2.2.  Recursive Resolvers that not support SWILD RR

   Recursive Resolver can deal with DNS response as usual.

   The next time, Recursive Resolver receives a "yyy.foo.com" A RR
   query, it can send DNS query to Authoritative Nameserver.

4.3.  Intermediate Nameserver: Forwarding Resolvers

   Forwarding Resolver sends query to its next-hop Resolver is similar
   with Recursive Resolver sends query to Authoritative Nameserver.

5.  DNS Cache

   Intermediate Nameservers' cache size can be reduced, avoid to cache
   various domains of the same wildcard domain configuration.

   Intermediate Nameservers' cache hit rate will rise, avoid to query
   Authoritative Nameserver for the same wildcard domain configuration.

6.  DNSSEC

   Clients and DNSSEC-Enabled Intermediate Nameservers can use DNSSEC to
   validate all the responses with the Authoritative Nameserver.

   DNSSEC-Enabled Intermediate Nameservers can only validate the SWILD
   RRSIG of "foo.com" and the RRSIGs of "_.foo.com", not need to
   validate the CNAME RRSIG of "yyy.foo.com".
