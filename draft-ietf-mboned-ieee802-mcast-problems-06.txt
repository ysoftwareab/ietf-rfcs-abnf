1.  Introduction

   Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of
   multicast in 802.11 [dot11], [mc-props], [mc-prob-stmt], and other
   local-area wireless environments.  Performance issues have been
   observed when multicast packet transmissions of IETF protocols are
   used over IEEE 802 wireless media.  Even though enhancements for
   multicast transmissions have been designed at both IETF and IEEE 802,
   incompatibilities still exist between specifications, implementations
   and configuration choices.

   Many IETF protocols depend on multicast/broadcast for delivery of
   control messages to multiple receivers.  Multicast is used for
   various purposes such as neighbor discovery, network flooding,
   address resolution, as well minimizing media occupancy for the
   transmission of data that is intended for multiple receivers.  In
   addition to protocol use of broadcast/multicast for control messages,
   more applications, such as push to talk in hospitals, or video in
   enterprises, universities, and homes, are sending multicast IP to end
   user devices, which are increasingly using Wi-Fi for their
   connectivity.

   IETF protocols typically rely on network protocol layering in order
   to reduce or eliminate any dependence of higher level protocols on
   the specific nature of the MAC layer protocols or the physical media.
   In the case of multicast transmissions, higher level protocols have
   traditionally been designed as if transmitting a packet to an IP
   address had the same cost in interference and network media access,
   regardless of whether the destination IP address is a unicast address
   or a multicast or broadcast address.  This model was reasonable for
   networks where the physical medium was wired, like Ethernet.
   Unfortunately, for many wireless media, the costs to access the
   medium can be quite different.  Multicast over Wi-Fi has often been
   plagued by such poor performance that it is disallowed.  Some
   enhancements have been designed in IETF protocols that are assumed to
   work primarily over wireless media.  However, these enhancements are
   usually implemented in limited deployments and not widespread on most
   wireless networks.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


   IEEE 802 wireless protocols have been designed with certain features
   to support multicast traffic.  For instance, lower modulations are
   used to transmit multicast frames, so that these can be received by
   all stations in the cell, regardless of the distance or path
   attenuation from the base station or access point.  However, these
   lower modulation transmissions occupy the medium longer; they hamper
   efficient transmission of traffic using higher order modulations to
   nearby stations.  For these and other reasons, IEEE 802 working
   groups such as 802.11 have designed features to improve the
   performance of multicast transmissions at Layer 2 [ietf_802-11].  In
   addition to protocol design features, certain operational and
   configuration enhancements can ameliorate the network performance
   issues created by multicast traffic, as described in Section 5.

   There seems to be general agreement that these problems will not be
   fixed anytime soon, primarily because it's expensive to do so, and
   multicast is unreliable.  Compared to unicast over Wi-Fi, multicast
   is often treated as somewhat a second class citizen, even though
   there are many protocols using multicast.  Something needs to be
   provided in order to make them more reliable.  IPv6 neighbor
   discovery saturating the Wi-Fi link is only part of the problem.  Wi-
   Fi traffic classes may help.  This document is intended to help make
   the determination about what problems should be solved by the IETF
   and what problems should be solved by the IEEE (see Section 8).

   This document details various problems caused by multicast
   transmission over wireless networks, including high packet error
   rates, no acknowledgements, and low data rate.  It also explains some
   enhancements that have been designed at IETF and IEEE 802 to
   ameliorate the effects of multicast traffic.  Recommendations are
   also provided to implementors about how to use and combine these
   enhancements.  Some advice about the operational choices that can be
   taken is also included.  It is likely that this document will also be
   considered relevant to designers of future IEEE wireless
   specifications.

3.  Identified multicast issues

3.1.  Issues at Layer 2 and Below

   In this section some of the issues related to the use of multicast
   transmissions over IEEE 802 wireless technologies are described.

3.1.1.  Multicast reliability

   Multicast traffic is typically much less reliable than unicast
   traffic.  Since multicast makes point-to-multipoint communications,
   multiple acknowledgements would be needed to guarantee reception at
   all recipients.  Since typically there are no ACKs for multicast
   packets, it is not possible for the Access Point (AP) to know whether
   or not a retransmission is needed.  Even in the wired Internet, this
   characteristic often causes undesirably high error rates.  This has
   contributed to the relatively slow uptake of multicast applications
   even though the protocols have long been available.  The situation
   for wireless links is much worse, and is quite sensitive to the
   presence of background traffic.  Consequently, there can be a high
   packet error rate (PER) due to lack of retransmission, and because
   the sender never backs off.  It is not uncommon for there to be a

   packet loss rate of 5% or more, which is particularly troublesome for
   video and other environments where high data rates and high
   reliability are required.

3.1.2.  Lower and Variable Data Rate

   Multicast over wired differs from multicast over wireless because
   transmission over wired links often occurs at a fixed rate.  Wi-Fi,
   on the other hand, has a transmission rate that varies depending upon
   the STA's proximity to the AP.  The throughput of video flows, and
   the capacity of the broader Wi-Fi network, will change and will
   impact the ability for QoS solutions to effectively reserve bandwidth
   and provide admission control.

   For wireless stations associated with an Access Point, the power
   necessary for good reception can vary from station to station.  For
   unicast, the goal is to minimize power requirements while maximizing
   the data rate to the destination.  For multicast, the goal is simply
   to maximize the number of receivers that will correctly receive the
   multicast packet; generally the Access Point has to use a much lower
   data rate at a power level high enough for even the farthest station
   to receive the packet, for example as briefly mentioned in [RFC5757].
   Consequently, the data rate of a video stream, for instance, would be
   constrained by the environmental considerations of the least reliable
   receiver associated with the Access Point.

   Because more robust modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) have longer
   range but also lower data rate, multicast / broadcast traffic is
   generally transmitted at the slowest rate of all the connected
   devices, also known as the basic rate.  The amount of additional
   interference depends on the specific wireless technology.  In fact
   backward compatibility and multi-stream implementations mean that the
   maximum unicast rates are currently up to a few Gb/s, so there can be
   a more than 3 orders of magnitude difference in the transmission rate
   between multicast / broadcast versus optimal unicast forwarding.
   Some techinues employed to increase spectral efficiency, such as
   spatial multiplexing in mimo systems, are not available with more
   than one intended reciever; it is not the case that backwards
   compatibility is the only factor responsible for lower multicast
   transmission rates.

   Wired multicast also affects wireless LANs when the AP extends the
   wired segment; in that case, multicast / broadcast frames on the
   wired LAN side are copied to WLAN.  Since broadcast messages are
   transmitted at the most robust MCS, many large frames are sent at a
   slow rate over the air.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


3.1.3.  High Interference

   Transmissions at a lower rate require longer occupancy of the
   wireless medium and thus take away from the airtime of other
   communications and degrade the overall capacity.  Furthermore,
   transmission at higher power, as is required to reach all multicast
   STAs associated to the AP, proportionately increases the area of
   interference.

3.1.4.  Power-save Effects on Multicast

   One of the characteristics of multicast transmission is that every
   station has to be configured to wake up to receive the multicast,
   even though the received packet may ultimately be discarded.  This
   process can have a large effect on the power consumption by the
   multicast receiver station.

   Multicast can work poorly with the power-save mechanisms defined in
   IEEE 802.11e, for the following reasons.

   o  Clients may be unable to stay in sleep mode due to multicast
      control packets frequently waking them up.
   o  Both unicast and multicast traffic can be delayed by power-saving
      mechanisms.
   o  A unicast packet is delayed until an STA wakes up and requests it.
      Unicast traffic may also be delayed to improve power save,
      efficiency and increase probability of aggregation.
   o  Multicast traffic is delayed in a wireless network if any of the
      STAs in that network are power savers.  All STAs associated to the
      AP have to be awake at a known time to receive multicast traffic.
   o  Packets can also be discarded due to buffer limitations in the AP
      and non-AP STA.

3.2.  Issues at Layer 3 and Above

   This section identifies some representative IETF protocols, and
   describes possible negative effects due to performance degradation
   when using multicast transmissions for control messages.  Common uses
   of multicast include:

   o  Control plane signaling
   o  Neighbor Discovery
   o  Address Resolution
   o  Service discovery
   o  Applications (video delivery, stock data, etc.)
   o  On-demand routing
   o  Backbone construction
   o  Other L3 protocols (non-IP)

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


   User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the most common transport layer
   protocol for multicast applications.  By itself, UDP is not reliable
   -- messages may be lost or delivered out of order.

3.2.1.  IPv4 issues

   The following list contains some representative multicast protocols
   that are used with IPv4.

   o  ARP
   o  DHCP
   o  mDNS [RFC6762]
   o  uPnP [RFC6970]

   After initial configuration, ARP and DHCP occur much less commonly,
   but service discovery can occur at any time.  Some widely-deployed
   service discovery protocols (e.g., for finding a printer) utilize
   mDNS (i.e., multicast).  It's often the first service that operators
   drop.  Even if multicast snooping is utilized, many devices can
   register at once and cause serious network degradation.

3.2.2.  IPv6 issues

   IPv6 makes extensive use of multicast, including the following:

   o  DHCPv6
   o  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
   o  Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
   o  Address Resolution
   o  Service Discovery
   o  Route Discovery
   o  Decentralized Address Assignment
   o  Geographic routing

   IPv6 NDP Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages used in DAD and Address
   Lookup make use of Link-Scope multicast.  In contrast to IPv4, an
   IPv6 node will typically use multiple addresses, and may change them
   often for privacy reasons.  This intensifies the impact of multicast
   messages that are associated to the mobility of a node.  Router
   advertisement (RA) messages are also periodically multicasted over
   the Link.

   Neighbors may be considered lost if several consecutive Neighbor
   Discovery packets fail.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


3.2.3.  MLD issues

   Multicast Listener Discovery(MLD) [RFC4541] is often used to identify
   members of a multicast group that are connected to the ports of a
   switch.  Forwarding multicast frames into a Wi-Fi-enabled area can
   use such switch support for hardware forwarding state information.
   However, since IPv6 makes heavy use of multicast, each STA with an
   IPv6 address will require state on the switch for several and
   possibly many multicast solicited-node addresses.  Multicast
   addresses that do not have forwarding state installed (perhaps due to
   hardware memory limitations on the switch) cause frames to be flooded
   on all ports of the switch.

3.2.4.  Spurious Neighbor Discovery

   On the Internet there is a "background radiation" of scanning traffic
   (people scanning for vulnerable machines) and backscatter (responses
   from spoofed traffic, etc).  This means that routers very often
   receive packets destined for IP addresses regardless of whether those
   IP addresses are in use.  In the cases where the IP is assigned to a
   host, the router broadcasts an ARP request, gets back an ARP reply,
   and caches it; then traffic can be delivered to the host.  When the
   IP address is not in use, the router broadcasts one (or more) ARP
   requests, and never gets a reply.  This means that it does not
   populate the ARP cache, and the next time there is traffic for that
   IP address the router will rebroadcast the ARP requests.

   The rate of these ARP requests is proportional to the size of the
   subnets, the rate of scanning and backscatter, and how long the
   router keeps state on non-responding ARPs.  As it turns out, this
   rate is inversely proportional to how occupied the subnet is (valid
   ARPs end up in a cache, stopping the broadcasting; unused IPs never
   respond, and so cause more broadcasts).  Depending on the address
   space in use, the time of day, how occupied the subnet is, and other
   unknown factors, on the order of 2000 broadcasts per second have been
   observed, for instance at the NOCs during IETF face-to-face meetings.

   On a wired network, there is not a huge difference between unicast,
   multicast and broadcast traffic.  Due to hardware filtering (see,
   e.g., [Deri-2010]), inadvertently flooded traffic (or excessive
   ethernet multicast) on wired networks can be quite a bit less costly,
   compared to wireless cases where sleeping devices have to wake up to
   process packets.  Wired Ethernets tend to be switched networks,
   further reducing interference from multicast.  There is effectively
   no collision / scheduling problem except at extremely high port
   utilizations.

   This is not true in the wireless realm; wireless equipment is often
   unable to send high volumes of broadcast and multicast traffic.
   Consequently, on the wireless networks, a significant number of
   dropped broadcast and multicast packets are observed.  This, in turn,
   means that when a host connects it is often not able to complete
   DHCP, and IPv6 RAs get dropped, leading to users being unable to use
   the network.

4.  Multicast protocol optimizations

   This section lists some optimizations that have been specified in
   IEEE 802 and IETF that are aimed at reducing or eliminating the
   issues discussed in Section 3.

4.1.  Proxy ARP in 802.11-2012

   The AP knows the MAC address and IP address for all associated STAs.
   In this way, the AP acts as the central "manager" for all the 802.11
   STAs in its BSS.  Proxy ARP is easy to implement at the AP, and
   offers the following advantages:

   o  Reduced broadcast traffic (transmitted at low MCS) on the wireless
      medium
   o  STA benefits from extended power save in sleep mode, as ARP
      requests for STA's IP address are handled instead by the AP.
   o  ARP frames are kept off the wireless medium.
   o  No changes are needed to STA implementation.

   Here is the specification language as described in clause 10.23.13 of
   [dot11-proxyarp]:

      When the AP supports Proxy ARP "[...] the AP shall maintain a
      Hardware Address to Internet Address mapping for each associated
      station, and shall update the mapping when the Internet Address of
      the associated station changes.  When the IPv4 address being
      resolved in the ARP request packet is used by a non-AP STA
      currently associated to the BSS, the proxy ARP service shall
      respond on behalf of the non-AP STA".

4.2.  IPv6 Address Registration and Proxy Neighbor Discovery

   As used in this section, a Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network
   (6LoWPAN) denotes a low power lossy network (LLN) that supports
   6LoWPAN Header Compression (HC) [RFC6282].  A 6TiSCH network
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] is an example of a 6LowPAN.  In order
   to control the use of IPv6 multicast over 6LoWPANs, the 6LoWPAN
   Neighbor Discovery (6LoWPAN ND) [RFC6775] standard defines an address
   registration mechanism that relies on a central registry to assess

   address uniqueness, as a substitute to the inefficient Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) mechanism found in the mainstream IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861][RFC4862].

   The 6lo Working Group has specified an update [RFC8505] to RFC6775.
   Wireless devices can register their address to a Backbone Router
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router], which proxies for the registered
   addresses with the IPv6 NDP running on a high speed aggregating
   backbone.  The update also enables a proxy registration mechanism on
   behalf of the registered node, e.g.  by a 6LoWPAN router to which the
   mobile node is attached.

   The general idea behind the backbone router concept is that broadcast
   and multicast messaging should be tightly controlled in a variety of
   Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (WPANs).  Connectivity to a particular link that provides
   the subnet should be left to Layer-3.  The model for the Backbone
   Router operation is represented in Figure 1.

   LLN nodes can move freely from an LLN anchored at one IPv6 Backbone
   Router to an LLN anchored at another Backbone Router on the same
   backbone, keeping any of the IPv6 addresses they have configured.
   The Backbone Routers maintain a Binding Table of their Registered
   Nodes, which serves as a distributed database of all the LLN Nodes.
   An extension to the Neighbor Discovery Protocol is introduced to

   exchange Binding Table information across the Backbone Link as needed
   for the operation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.

   RFC6775 and follow-on work [RFC8505] address the needs of LLNs, and
   similar techniques are likely to be valuable on any type of link
   where sleeping devices are attached, or where the use of broadcast
   and multicast operations should be limited.

4.3.  Buffering to Improve Battery Life

   Methods have been developed to help save battery life; for example, a
   device might not wake up when the AP receives a multicast packet.
   The AP acts on behalf of STAs in various ways.  To enable use of the
   power-saving feature for STAs in its BSS, the AP buffers frames for
   delivery to the STA at the time when the STA is scheduled for
   reception.  If an AP, for instance, expresses a DTIM (Delivery
   Traffic Indication Message) of 3 then the AP will send a multicast
   packet every 3 packets.  In fact, when any single wireless STA
   associated with an access point has 802.11 power-save mode enabled,
   the access point buffers all multicast frames and sends them only
   after the next DTIM beacon.

   In practice, most AP's will send a multicast every 30 packets.  For
   unicast the AP could send a TIM (Traffic Indication Message), but for
   multicast the AP sends a broadcast to everyone.  DTIM does power
   management but STAs can choose whether or not to wake up or not and
   whether or not to drop the packet.  Unfortunately, without proper
   administrative control, such STAs may be unable to determine why
   their multicast operations do not work.

4.4.  IPv6 support in 802.11-2012

   IPv6 uses Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) instead of ARP.  Every
   IPv6 node subscribes to a special multicast address for this purpose.

   Here is the specification language from clause 10.23.13 of
   [dot11-proxyarp]:

      "When an IPv6 address is being resolved, the Proxy Neighbor
      Discovery service shall respond with a Neighbor Advertisement
      message [...] on behalf of an associated STA to an [ICMPv6]
      Neighbor Solicitation message [...].  When MAC address mappings
      change, the AP may send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement
      Messages on behalf of a STA."

   NDP may be used to request additional information

   o  Maximum Transmission Unit

   o  Router Solicitation
   o  Router Advertisement, etc.

   NDP messages are sent as group addressed (broadcast) frames in
   802.11.  Using the proxy operation helps to keep NDP messages off the
   wireless medium.

4.5.  Using Unicast Instead of Multicast

   It is often possible to transmit multicast control and data messages
   by using unicast transmissions to each station individually.

4.5.1.  Overview

   In many situations, it's a good choice to use unicast instead of
   multicast over the Wi-Fi link.  This avoids most of the problems
   specific to multicast over Wi-Fi, since the individual frames are
   then acknowledged and buffered for power save clients, in the way
   that unicast traffic normally operates.

   This approach comes with the tradeoff of sometimes sending the same
   packet multiple times over the Wi-Fi link.  However, in many cases,
   such as video into a residential home network, this can be a good
   tradeoff, since the Wi-Fi link may have enough capacity for the
   unicast traffic to be transmitted to each subscribed STA, even though
   multicast addressing may have been necessary for the upstream access
   network.

   Several technologies exist that can be used to arrange unicast
   transport over the Wi-Fi link, outlined in the subsections below.

4.5.2.  Layer 2 Conversion to Unicast

   It is often possible to transmit multicast control and data messages
   by using unicast transmissions to each station individually.

   Although there is not yet a standardized method of conversion, at
   least one widely available implementation exists in the Linux
   bridging code [bridge-mc-2-uc].  Other proprietary implementations
   are available from various vendors.  In general, these
   implementations perform a straightforward mapping for groups or
   channels, discovered by IGMP or MLD snooping, to the corresponding
   unicast MAC addresses.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


4.5.3.  Directed Multicast Service (DMS)

   There are situations where more is needed than simply converting
   multicast to unicast.  For these purposes, DMS enables an STA to
   request that the AP transmit multicast group addressed frames
   destined to the requesting STAs as individually addressed frames
   [i.e., convert multicast to unicast].  Here are some characteristics
   of DMS:

   o  Requires 802.11n A-MSDUs
   o  Individually addressed frames are acknowledged and are buffered
      for power save STAs
   o  The requesting STA may specify traffic characteristics for DMS
      traffic
   o  DMS was defined in IEEE Std 802.11v-2011
   o  DMS requires changes to both AP and STA implementation.

   DMS is not currently implemented in products.  See [Tramarin2017] and
   [Oliva2013] for more information.

4.5.4.  Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT)

   AMT[RFC7450] provides a method to tunnel multicast IP packets inside
   unicast IP packets over network links that only support unicast.
   When an operating system or application running on an STA has an AMT
   gateway capability integrated, it's possible to use unicast to
   traverse the Wi-Fi link by deploying an AMT relay in the non-Wi-Fi
   portion of the network connected to the AP.

   It is RECOMMENDED that multicast-enabled networks deploying AMT
   relays for this purpose make the relays discoverable with the
   following methods:

   o  DNS-SD [RFC6763]
   o  the well-known IP addresses from Section 7 of [RFC7450], and
   o  DRIAD [I-D.ietf-mboned-driad-amt-discovery]

   Providing the multiple standard discovery methods makes it more
   likely that AMT gateway implementations will discover the local
   multicast-capable network, rather than forming a connection to an AMT
   relay further upstream.

4.6.  GroupCast with Retries (GCR)

   GCR (defined in [dot11aa]) provides greater reliability by using
   either unsolicited retries or a block acknowledgement mechanism.  GCR
   increases probability of broadcast frame reception success, but still
   does not guarantee success.



Perkins, et al.          Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


   For the block acknowledgement mechanism, the AP transmits each group
   addressed frame as conventional group addressed transmission.
   Retransmissions are group addressed, but hidden from non-11aa STAs.
   A directed block acknowledgement scheme is used to harvest reception
   status from receivers; retransmissions are based upon these
   responses.

   GCR is suitable for all group sizes including medium to large groups.
   As the number of devices in the group increases, GCR can send block
   acknowledgement requests to only a small subset of the group.  GCR
   does require changes to both AP and STA implementation.

   GCR may introduce unacceptable latency.  After sending a group of
   data frames to the group, the AP has do the following:

   o  unicast a Block Ack Request (BAR) to a subset of members.
   o  wait for the corresponding Block Ack (BA).
   o  retransmit any missed frames.
   o  resume other operations that may have been delayed.

   This latency may not be acceptable for some traffic.

   There are ongoing extensions in 802.11 to improve GCR performance.

   o  BAR is sent using downlink MU-MIMO (note that downlink MU-MIMO is
      already specified in 802.11-REVmc 4.3).
   o  BA is sent using uplink MU-MIMO (which is a .11ax feature).
   o  Additional 802.11ax extensions are under consideration; see
      [mc-ack-mux]
   o  Latency may also be reduced by simultaneously receiving BA
      information from multiple STAs.

5.  Operational optimizations

   This section lists some operational optimizations that can be
   implemented when deploying wireless IEEE 802 networks to mitigate the
   issues discussed in Section 3.

5.1.  Mitigating Problems from Spurious Neighbor Discovery

   ARP Sponges

         An ARP Sponge sits on a network and learn which IP addresses
         are actually in use.  It also listen for ARP requests, and, if
         it sees an ARP for an IP address that it believes is not used,
         it will reply with its own MAC address.  This means that the
         router now has an IP to MAC mapping, which it caches.  If that
         IP is later assigned to an machine (e.g using DHCP), the ARP



Perkins, et al.          Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


         sponge will see this, and will stop replying for that address.
         Gratuitous ARPs (or the machine ARPing for its gateway) will
         replace the sponged address in the router ARP table.  This
         technique is quite effective; but, unfortunately, the ARP
         sponge daemons were not really designed for this use (the
         standard one [arpsponge], was designed to deal with the
         disappearance of participants from an IXP) and so are not
         optimized for this purpose.  One daemon is needed per subnet,
         the tuning is tricky (the scanning rate versus the population
         rate versus retires, etc.) and sometimes the daemons just seem
         to stop, requiring a restart of the daemon and causing
         disruption.

   Router mitigations

         Some routers (often those based on Linux) implement a "negative
         ARP cache" daemon.  Simply put, if the router does not see a
         reply to an ARP it can be configured to cache this information
         for some interval.  Unfortunately, the core routers in use
         often do not support this.  When a host connects to network and
         gets an IP address, it will ARP for its default gateway (the
         router).  The router will update its cache with the IP to host
         MAC mapping learnt from the request (passive ARP learning).

   Firewall unused space

         The distribution of users on wireless networks / subnets
         changes from IETF meeting to the next (e.g SSIDs are renamed,
         some SSIDs lose favor, etc).  This makes utilization for
         particular SSIDs difficult to predict ahead of time, but usage
         can be monitored as attendees use the different networks.
         Configuring multiple DHCP pools per subnet, and enabling them
         sequentially, can create a large subnet, from which only
         addresses in the lower portions are assigned.  Therefore input
         IP access lists can be applied, which deny traffic to the
         upper, unused portions.  Then the router does not attempt to
         forward packets to the unused portions of the subnets, and so
         does not ARP for it.  This method has proven to be very
         effective, but is somewhat of a blunt axe, is fairly labor
         intensive, and requires coordination.

   Disabling/filtering ARP requests

         In general, the router does not need to ARP for hosts; when a
         host connects, the router can learn the IP to MAC mapping from
         the ARP request sent by that host.  Consequently it should be
         possible to disable and / or filter ARP requests from the
         router.  Unfortunately, ARP is a very low level / fundamental



Perkins, et al.          Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


         part of the IP stack, and is often offloaded from the normal
         control plane.  While many routers can filter layer-2 traffic,
         this is usually implemented as an input filter and / or has
         limited ability to filter output broadcast traffic.  This means
         that the simple "just disable ARP or filter it outbound" seems
         like a really simple (and obvious) solution, but
         implementations / architectural issues make this difficult or
         awkward in practice.

   NAT

         The broadcasts are overwhelmingly being caused by outside
         scanning / backscatter traffic.  To NAT the entire (or a large
         portion) of the attendee networks would eliminate NAT
         translation entries for unused addresses, and so the router
         would never ARP for them.  However, there are many reasons to
         avoid using NAT in such a blanket fashion.

   Stateful firewalls

         Another obvious solution would be to put a stateful firewall
         between the wireless network and the Internet.  This firewall
         would block incoming traffic not associated with an outbound
         request.  But this conflicts with the need and desire of the
         IETF and other organizations to have the network as open as
         possible and to honor the end-to-end principle.  An attendee on
         the meeting network should be an Internet host, and should be
         able to receive unsolicited requests.  Unfortunately, keeping
         the network working and stable is the first priority and a
         stateful firewall may be required in order to achieve this.

5.2.  Mitigating Spurious Service Discovery Messages

         In networks that must support hundreds of STAs, operators have
         observed network degradation due to many devices simultaneously
         registering with mDNS.  In a network with many clients, it is
         recommended to ensure that mDNS packets designed to discover
         services in smaller home networks be constrained to avoid
         disrupting other traffic.

6.  Multicast Considerations for Other Wireless Media

   Many of the causes of performance degradation described in earlier
   sections are also observable for wireless media other than 802.11.

   For instance, problems with power save, excess media occupancy, and
   poor reliability will also affect 802.15.3 and 802.15.4.
   Unfortunately, 802.15 media specifications do not yet include



Perkins, et al.          Expires January 9, 2020               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


   mechanisms similar to those developed for 802.11.  In fact, the
   design philosophy for 802.15 is oriented towards minimality, with the
   result that many such functions are relegated to operation within
   higher layer protocols.  This leads to a patchwork of non-
   interoperable and vendor-specific solutions.  See [uli] for some
   additional discussion, and a proposal for a task group to resolve
   similar issues, in which the multicast problems might be considered
   for mitigation.

   Similar considerations hold for most other wireless media.  A brief
   introduction is provided in [RFC5757] for the following:

   o  802.16 WIMAX
   o  3GPP/3GPP2
   o  DVB-H / DVB-IPDC
   o  TV Broadcast and Satellite Networks

7.  Recommendations

   This section will provide some recommendations about the usage and
   combinations of the multicast enhancements described in Section 4 and
   Section 5.

   Future protocol documents utilizing multicast signaling should be
   carefully scrutinized if the protocol is likely to be used over
   wireless media.

   Proxy methods should be encouraged to conserve network bandwidth and
   power utilization by low-power devices.  The device can use a unicast
   message to its proxy, and then the proxy can take care of any needed
   multicast operations.

   Multicast signaling for wireless devices should be done in a way
   compatible with low duty-cycle operation.

8.  Discussion Items

   This section suggests two discussion items for further resolution.

   The IETF should determine guidelines by which it may be decided that
   multicast packets are to be sent wired.  For example, 802.1ak works
   on ethernet and Wi-Fi.  802.1ak has been pulled into 802.1Q as of
   802.1Q-2011.  802.1Q-2014 can be found here:
   http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q-2014.html.  If a generic
   solution is not found, guidelines for multicast over Wi-Fi should be
   established.

Internet-Draft      Multicast Over IEEE 802 Wireless           July 2019


   Reliable registration to Layer-2 multicast groups and a reliable
   multicast operation at Layer-2 might provide a generic solution.
   There is no need to support 2^24 groups to get solicited node
   multicast working: it is possible to simply select a number of
   trailing bits that make sense for a given network size to limit the
   number of unwanted deliveries to reasonable levels.  IEEE 802.1,
   802.11, and 802.15 should be encouraged to revisit L2 multicast
   issues.  In reality, Wi-Fi provides a broadcast service, not a
   multicast service.  On the physical medium, all frames are broadcast
   except in very unusual cases in which special beamforming
   transmitters are used.  Unicast offers the advantage of being much
   faster (2 orders of magnitude) and much more reliable (L2 ARQ).

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce or modify any security mechanisms.

   As noted in [group_key], the unreliable nature of multicast
   transmission over wireless media can cause subtle problems with
   multicast group key management and updates.  Quoting from that
   website, "... most clients are able to get connected and surf the
   web, check email, etc. even when FromDS multicasts are broken.  So a
   lot of people don't realize they have multicast problems on their
   network..."

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
