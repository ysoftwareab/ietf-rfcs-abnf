                  YANG-Push Notification Capabilities
            draft-ietf-netconf-notification-capabilities-08

Abstract

   This document proposes a YANG module that allows a publisher to
   specify capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG Datastores"
   (YANG-Push).  It proposes to use YANG Instance Data to document this
   information and make it already available at implementation-time, but
   also allow it to be reported at run-time.

   The YANG module is also prepared to contain other system
   capabilities, for future augmentations.

   publisher, available from a source other then a running server
   implementing the publisher.

   Run-time information: Information about the publisher's behavior that
   is available from the running server (implementing the publisher) via
   management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].

2.  Introduction

   As defined in [RFC8641] a publisher may allow subscribers to
   subscribe to updates from a datastore and subsequently push such
   update notifications to the receiver.  Notifications may be sent
   periodically or on-change (more or less immediately after each
   change).

   A publisher supporting YANG-Push has a number of capabilities defined
   in [RFC8641] that are often determined during the implementation of
   the publisher.  These include:

   o  Supported (reporting) periods for periodic subscriptions

   o  Maximum number of objects that can be sent in an update

   o  The set of datastores or data nodes for which periodic
      notification is supported

   If the optional on-change feature is supported, additionally:

   o  Supported dampening periods for on-change subscriptions

   o  The set of datastores or data nodes for which on-change
      notification is supported

   Publishers have limitations in how many update notifications and how
   many datastore node updates they can send out in a certain time-
   period.

   Publishers might not support periodic subscriptions to all
   datastores.

   In some cases, a publisher supporting on-change notifications will
   not be able to push updates for some object types on-change.  Reasons
   for this might be that the value of the datastore node changes
   frequently (e.g. in-octets counter), that small object changes are
   frequent and irrelevant to the receiver (e.g., a temperature gauge
   changing 0.1 degrees within a predetermined and acceptable range), or
   that the implementation is not capable of on-change notification for
   a particular object.  In those cases, it will be important for



Lengyel, et al.           Expires June 11, 2020                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities     December 2019


   subscriber applications to have a way to identify which objects on-
   change notifications are supported and for which ones not.

   Faced with the reality that support for on-change notification does
   not mean that such notifications will be sent for any specific data
   node, subscriber/management applications can not rely on the on-
   change functionality unless the subscriber has some means to identify
   which objects on-change notifications are supported.  YANG models are
   meant to be used as an interface contract.  Without identification of
   the data nodes actually supporting on-change, this contract would be
   incomplete.

   This document proposes a YANG module that allows a subscriber to
   discover YANG-Push related capabilities both at implementation-time
   and run-time.

   Implementation-time information is needed by Network Management
   System (NMS) implementers.  A NMS implementation that wants to
   support notifications, needs the information about on-change
   notification capability.  If the information is not documented in a
   way available to the NMS designer, but only as instance data from the
   network node once it is deployed, the NMS implementation will be
   delayed, because it has to wait for the network node to be ready.  In
   addition, the assumption that all NMS implementers will have a
   correctly configured network node available to retrieve data from is
   an expensive proposition and may not always hold.  (An NMS may need
   to be able to handle many dozens of network node types.)  Often a
   fully functional NMS is a requirement for introducing a new network
   node type into a network, so delaying NMS readiness effectively also
   delays the time at which a new network node type can be introduced
   into the network.

   Implementation-time information is needed by system integrators.
   When introducing a network node type into their network, operators
   often need to integrate the node type into their own management
   system.  The NMS may have management functions that depend on on-
   change notifications.  The network operator needs to plan his
   management practices and NMS implementation before he even decides to
   buy the specific network node type.  Moreover the decision to buy the
   node type sometimes depends on these management possibilities.

   Run-time information is needed:

   o  for any "purely model driven" application, e.g. a NETCONF-browser.
      Such applications depend on reading models, capabilities in run-
      time to support all the publisher's available functionality.

   o  in case the capability might change during run-time e.g. due to
      licensing, HW constraints etc.

   o  to check that capability information provided early, already in
      implementation-time is indeed what the publisher implements (is
      the supplied documentation correct?)

   The proposed YANG module is also intended as a base model to be
   augmented by other YANG modules defining system-capabilities not
   related to YANG-Push.  Other capability defining YANG modules MAY
   augment the data nodes specifying these capabilites into this model.

3.  Notification Capability Model

   It is a goal to provide YANG-Push notification capability information
   in a format that is:

   o  vendor independent

   o  machine readable

   o  identical for implementation-time and run-time

   The YANG module ietf-notification-capabilities is defined to provide
   the information.  It contains:

   o  a set of capabilities related to the throughput of notification
      data the publisher can send out.

   o  specification of which data nodes support on-change notifications.

   Capability values can be specified on system/publisher level,
   datastore level or on specific data nodes (and their contained sub-
   tree) of a specific datastore.  Capability values on a smaller, more
   specific part of the publisher's data always override more generic
   values.

   Note: The solution is usable for both NMDA and non-NMDA systems.  For
   non-NMDA servers/publishers the config=false data is considered as if
   it was part of the running datastore.

   The information SHOULD be provided in two ways both following the
   ietf-notification-capabilities module:

   o  For the implementation-time use-case: It SHOULD be provided by the
      implementer as YANG instance data file complying to
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format].  The file SHALL be
      available already in implementation-time retrievable in a way that

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities     December 2019


      does not depend on a live network node.  E.g. download from
      product website.

   o  For the run-time use-case: It SHOULD be available via NETCONF
      [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] from the live server (implementing
      the publisher) during run-time.  Implementations which support
      changing these capabilities at run-time SHOULD support on-change
      notifications about the system-capabilities container.

     notifications.

     Capability values can be specified on system/publisher level,
     datastore level or on specific data nodes (and their contained
     sub-tree) of a specific datastore.
     If a capability is specified on multiple levels, the
     specification on a more specific level overrides more
     generic capability specifications; thus
     - a system/publisher level specification is overridden by any
     other specification
     - a datastore level specification (with a node-selector '/') is
     overridden by a specification with a more specific node-selector.
     - a specification for a specific datastore and node-selector
     is overridden by a specification for the same datastore with
     a node-slector that describes more levels of containing lists
     and containers.

     If, different data nodes covered by a single subscription
     have different values for a specific capability, then using values
     that are only acceptable for some of these data nodes, but not for
     others, may result in the rejection of the subscription.


     To find a capability value for a specific node in a
     specific datastore the user SHALL
     1) consider the system/publisher level capabilities under the
     system-capabilities container if the
     capability value is specified.
     2) search for a datastore-capabilities list entry for
     the specific datastore.
     3) within that datastore entry search for a
     per-node-capabilities entry that specifies the specific
     capability and that has the node-selector selecting the
     specific data node and that specifies the most levels of
     containing containers and lists.
     4) If no entries are found in the previous steps the
     publisher is not capable of providing a value because
     it is unknown, the capability is changing for some reason,
     there is no specified limit etc. In this case the
     publisher's behavior is unspecified.

     The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
     'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED',
     'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document
     are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119)
     (RFC 8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
     capitals, as shown here.

   <CODE ENDS>

3.3.  Other System Capabilities

   Other YANG modules defined in separate documents MAY augment this
   module to define other capabilities not related to YANG-Push.  Every
   set of such capabilities SHOULD be wrapped in a container similar to
   the subscription-capabilities container in this YANG module to
   cleanly separate different groups of capabilities.  The "other-
   capabilities" container SHOULD be augmented as a sibling to the
   subscription-capabilities container.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   All protocol-accessible data nodes are read-only and cannot be
   modified.  The data in this module is not security sensitive.  Access
   control may be configured, to avoid exposing the read-only data.

   When that data is in file format, data should be protected against
   modification or unauthorized access using normal file handling
   mechanisms.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-notification-capabilities
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

     Figure 1: Notification Capabilities with datastore level settings

   The following is the instance-data describing the notification
   capabilities of a hypothetical "acme-router".  The router implements
   the running, and operational datastores.  Every change can be
   reported on-change from running, but only config=true nodes and some
   config=false data from operational.  Interface statistics are not
   reported on-change only 2 important counters.  Datastore subscription
   capabilities are not reported on-change as they never change on the
   acme-router during run-time.

Appendix B.  Changes between revisions

   v07 - v08

   o  Prepared the YANG model to include other non-YANG-Push related
      capabilities.

   o  Renamed the top level container to system-capabilities

   o  Added a container subscription-capabilities to the grouping
      subscription-capabilities to contain all subscription related
      capabilities

   o  Updated examples according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-
      file-format-06.

   v06 - v07

   o  Updated examples according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-
      file-format-05.

   v05 - v06

   o  Providing the capability data is only a "SHOULD" recommendation.
      Some reviewers wanted MUST some wanted much less.

   o  The YANG module import statements now indicate the imported
      modules that must be implemented not just available as import as
      requested by the YangDoctors review.

   v04 - v05

   o  Added new capabilities periodic-notifications-supported and
      supported-excluded-change-type.

   o  Restructured YANG module to make the node-selector's usage similar
      to how NACM uses it: "/" means the whole datastore.

   o  Small corrections, spelling, rewording

   o  Replaced the term server with the term publisher except in cases
      where we speak about datastores and functionality based on get,
      getconfig operations.  In this latter case it is really the server
      functionality that is discussed

   v03 - v04

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities     December 2019


   o  Clarified recommended support for on-change notifications about
      the datastore-subscription-capabilities.

   v02 - v03

   o  Allow throughput related capabilities to be defined on top,
      datastore or data node level.  Described that specific capability
      values always override generic ones.

   o  Indicate that non-NMDA servers can also use this model.

   o  Updated according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-
      format-04

   v01 - v02

   o  Added instance data examples

   o  On-change capability can be defined per datastore

   o  Added "if-feature yp:on-change" where relevant

   o  Unified units used

   v00 - v01

   o  Add more capabilities: minimum period, supported period max-number
      of objects, min dampening period, dampening supported
