Abstract

   Education and newcomer orientation activities have existed in the
   IETF in various forms from the early 1990s (if not earlier). As the
   IETF and the world around us evolves, we are now rethinking what
   types of activities are best suited for the future. A mentoring
   program also exists at IETF that matches newcomers with experienced
   IETF participants.  Mentoring is confined to on-site attendees.  This
   draft proposes a merger of the mentoring and EDU functions as well as
   potential new activities such as videos, webcasts, and remote
   participation.

1 Background

   Many individuals have graciously contributed their time to talk about
   the IETF generally, about the tools that we use in our work, trained
   working group chairs, and introduced various technical topics. A key
   activity has the Sunday orientation sessions before our meetings
   begin, but there's also a wealth of material at the team's web site.
   Many presentations have been held in different languages, and
   information about the IETF (such as the Tao) also exist in many
   languages. In the last couple of years, we have also launched the
   mentoring program, pairing new participants with more experienced
   ones. There are also related activities, such as the ISOC Fellow and
   Policy programs, drawing in additional people to IETF meetings. All
   this has made a big impact, but of course we must also continuously
   evaluate what methods work best. At the same time we are looking for
   new blood for the team.

   Our crystal ball for the future says that we will see more and more:

   - mixing of product prototyping, open source, and standards efforts
   - collaboration and information being over the Internet
   - participants that employ remote participation
   - working methods that follow general Internet usage

   A newcomer's orientation at the meeting is still very useful; we
   often get several hundred new participants in our meetings. However,
   perhaps the focus of our efforts should be elsewhere. How do we cater
   for the open source developer who has not been to the IETF before,
   but wants to publish a YANG data model as an RFC. She is on a mission
   to implement a feature, and waiting for the next meeting may be a
   burden. Can we do something to enable people to join IETF efforts
   with a lower level of effort, or with more targeted help for their
   specific circumstances? And can we provide our educational efforts in
   a modern Internet fashion? And can we employ economies of scale, so
   that we would only have to do things once and then they can be
   replicated many times?

2 EDU Team


2.1 EDU Team History

   The IETF Education (EDU) Team, a project organized within the General
   Area, manages the internal education efforts of the IETF. Its efforts
   are focused primarily on education for IETF participants and leaders.
   Historically, each Sunday before the week of IETF meetings, an
   introductory class for newcomers would be held. In 2004, a decision
   was made to widen the curriculum offered by the EDU team, and today

INTERNET DRAFT          kuehne-gen-edu-mentor-00           June 11, 2015


   typically four different tutorials are held. The EDU team also holds
   a lunchtime session for current Working Group chairs on selected
   topics.


2.2 EDU Mission, Scope, Current Activities

   The mission of the IETF education activities are defined as follows:

   The EDU team manages the internal educational activities of the IETF
   with the goal of improving the effectiveness of IETF operations. We
   strive to improve the effectiveness of IETF leaders and participants
   by offering training sessions and educational materials that clarify
   their roles and responsibilities and prepare them to be more
   effective in their roles.

   Following this mission, two types of tutorials are offered:

   - Process-oriented tutorials, like the newcomers tutorial or
   tutorials on how to use the IETF tools or how to write an RFC.-
   Technical tutorials that cover certain technical topics widely
   relevant for IETF participants such as privacy, security, routing and
   wireless. In particular, the EDU Team aims for topics where
   specialist knowledge might affect the work of multiple different
   working groups.

   Some time ago, the EDU Team started a series of high-level overviews
   of the IETF areas. Tutorials can be suggested by anyone.

   A list of all tutorials, including slides and meetecho recordings,
   can be found on the EDU Team's web site: http://www.ietf.org/edu/.
   The EDU Team also maintains a wiki:
   http://wiki.tools.ietf.org/group/edu/wiki

3 Mentoring Program

3.1 Mentoring Program History

   The mentoring program was started by Alissa Cooper and Brian Haberman
   in 2013.

3.2 Mentoring Program Mission, Scope, Current Activities

   The goal of the IETF Mentoring Program is to match experienced IETF
   participants with newcomers in order to aid their integration into
   the IETF community through advice, help, and collected wisdom. The
   guidance provided by the mentors should speed up the time it takes
   for newcomers to become active, contributing members of the IETF.

INTERNET DRAFT          kuehne-gen-edu-mentor-00           June 11, 2015


   Currently, the mentoring program operates only at IETF meetings.

   If a mentee signs up with enough advance notice (3 weeks or so before
   the conference), then the IETF Secretariat will arrange for a web-
   based conference call between the mentor and mentee.

   Currently, the matching of mentor and mentees is done by volunteer
   coordinators assisted by the IETF Secretariat. The tracking and
   assignments are based on a relatively crude system (i.e. XCel
   spreadsheet). Work is being done to create a set of web pages to
   assist in this area.


4 Plans and Ideas for the Future

4.1 Merge Mentoring and EDU Teams

   Since both activities have a similar mission and are meant to prepare
   attendees for an effective participation in the IETF processes, we
   consider to merge the EDU Team and the Mentoring Programme and to
   organize the Mentoring Programme as an activity of the EDU team.


4.2 Videos / Webinars

   We propose to organize online webinars and/or short videos as an
   introduction to an area, Internet draft or a working group (WG).
   These sessions would provide an overview of the topic, position the
   area or the WG in the overall context of the IETF and highlight any
   specific hot topics or drafts currently being worked on.

   Once recorded in high quality fashion, anything that we do will build
   up a library of material that can be used over and over again. And
   viewed by anyone, including those busy people who may not have time
   to attend a session on Sundays. Delivered on a modern Internet
   platform, these videos can be easily distributed, shared and pointed
   to, without much effort from the IETF's side. Having more (easily
   digestible) information available online and providing more context,
   would help new participants to get familiar with the IETF. It would
   make it easier to find their way into the IETF workings and identify
   the areas and WGs they are interested in. These videos or webinars
   could be used as a stepping stone from which people can then dive
   deeper into certain drafts and documents. It could also spark
   interest in other communities that are not necessarily involved in
   the IETF at the moment, for instance the open source community or the
   network operators operator's community.

   Videos can also be beneficial to more experienced IETF participants.

INTERNET DRAFT          kuehne-gen-edu-mentor-00           June 11, 2015


   The webinars could act as preparation for face-to-face meetings. It
   could help meeting participants to be more prepared and active at the
   meetings themselves.

   This, in turn, could be useful for WG chairs as well if those
   attending the meetings (or being active on the mailing list) have
   specific a certain background knowledge. It could potentially
   increase the quality of WG meetings and drafts and provide more
   fruitful discussions. It could also help to attract more participants
   and encourage them to get involved. Having videos that explain "how
   we got here" for a particular group or draft will be very helpful to
   encourage participation in a WG by people who may not know all the
   history. So hopefully, this will particularly help younger people,
   women, and the non-western world.

4.3 Topic Videos

   The second idea is focused on more targeted topics. Previously, we've
   used most of our resources on fairly generic, broad topics. Such as
   the overall IETF orientation. Could we have 5-10 minute videos on how
   to submit a data model to the IETF, TCP buffer bloat or what the UTA
   working group is doing?

4.4 Remote Participation

   Many groups have a regional presence. It may be possible to have
   locations (perhaps at Universities) at various places in the world
   where people could go physically and participate in IETF meetings
   remotely -- but together. It is not as good as being at IETF itself
   but there is still face-to-face contact. In fact, maybe the regional
   group might decide to focus on one WG or set of drafts and all watch
   the appropriate videos together the day before and then think about
   how to comment.

4.5 Topic Focused Mentoring

   Mentors who could guide use of the videos to help someone learn a
   topic.

4.6 Future of Sunday tutorials

   In this context we would also like to discuss the future of the
   Sunday tutorials. Do we want to keep them as they are? Do we only
   want to keep the Newcomers tutorial? Some people suggested that this
   is actually not the best time for newcomers to learn about the IETF
   structure (it's either too late or too early).

   Do we want to keep the face-to-face tutorials or maybe use the time

INTERNET DRAFT          kuehne-gen-edu-mentor-00           June 11, 2015


   for some sort of advice and consultation sessions? Or maybe do some
   sort of webinars with people in the room?

5 Organizational Structure

   With all these additional activities, the EDU team needs to be broken
   into four functions:

   1. Current EDU activities
   2. Current Mentoring Activities
   3. Video Team
   4. Remote Participation

   Each will need to have the functions defined and people to staff it.

6 IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

7 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
