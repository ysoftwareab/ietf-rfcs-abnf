1.  Introduction

   This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys
   (PSKs) in TLS.  It lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs
   under certain assumptions and demonstrates how violations of these
   assumptions lead to attacks.  This document also discusses PSK use
   cases, provisioning processes, and TLS stack implementation support
   in the context of these assumptions.  It provides advice for
   applications in various use cases to help meet these assumptions.

   The guidance provided in this document is applicable across TLS
   [RFC8446], DTLS [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13], and Constrained TLS
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-ctls].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  PSK Security Properties

   The external PSK authentication mechanism in TLS implicitly assumes
   one fundamental property: each PSK is known to exactly one client and
   one server, and that these never switch roles.  If this assumption is
   violated, then the security properties of TLS are severely weakened.

   As discussed in Section 6, there are use cases where it is desirable
   for multiple clients or multiple servers share a PSK.  If this is
   done naively by having all members share a common key, then TLS only
   authenticates the entire group, and the security of the overall
   system is inherently rather brittle.  There are a number of obvious
   weaknesses here:

   1.  Any group member can impersonate any other group member.

   2.  If a group member is compromised, then the attacker can
       impersonate any group member (this follows from property (1)).

   3.  If PSK without DH is used, then compromise of any group member
       allows the attacker to passively read all traffic.

   In addition to these, a malicious non-member can reroute handshakes
   between honest group members to connect them in unintended ways, as
   detailed below.

   Let the group of peers who know the key be "A", "B", and "C".  The
   attack proceeds as follows:

   1.  "A" sends a "ClientHello" to "B".

   2.  The attacker intercepts the message and redirects it to "C".

   3.  "C" responds with a "ServerHello" to "A".

   4.  "A" sends a "Finished" message to "B".  "A" has completed the
       handshake, ostensibly with "B".

   5.  The attacker redirects the "Finished" message to "C".  "C" has
       completed the handshake, ostensibly with "A".

   This attack violates the peer authentication property, and if "C"
   supports a weaker set of cipher suites than "B", this attack also
   violates the downgrade protection property.  This rerouting is a type
   of identity misbinding attack [Krawczyk][Sethi].  Selfie attack
   [Selfie] is a special case of the rerouting attack against a group
   member that can act both as TLS server and client.  In the Selfie
   attack, a malicious non-member reroutes a connection from the client
   to the server on the same endpoint.

4.  Recommendations for External PSK Usage

   Applications MUST use external PSKs that adhere to the following
   requirements:

   1.  Each PSK MUST be derived from at least 128 of entropy and MUST be
       at least 128-bits long unless the TLS handshake is being used
       with a separate key establishment mechanism such as a Diffie-
       Hellman exchange.  This recommendation protects against passive
       attacks using exhaustive search of the PSK.

   2.  Each PSK MUST NOT be shared between with more than two logical
       nodes.  As a result, an agent that acts as both a client and a
       server MUST use distinct PSKs when acting as the client from when
       it is acting as the server.  This prevents redirection attacks.

   3.  Nodes SHOULD use external PSK importers
       [I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer] when configuring PSKs for
       each pair of TLS client and server.  If a distinct importer is
       used for each pair, then this satisfies condition (2).

   4.  Where possible the master PSK (that which is fed into the
       importer) SHOULD be deleted after the imported keys have been
       generated.  This protects an attacker from bootstrapping a
       compromise of one node into the ability to attack connections
       between any node; otherwise the attacker can recover the master
       key and then re-run the importer itself.

5.  Privacy Properties

   PSK privacy properties are orthogonal to security properties
   described in Section 3.  Traditionally, TLS does little to keep PSK
   identity information private.  For example, an adversary learns
   information about the external PSK or its identifier by virtue of it
   appearing in cleartext in a ClientHello.  As a result, a passive
   adversary can link two or more connections together that use the same
   external PSK on the wire.  Applications should take precautions when
   using external PSKs if these risks.

Internet-Draft   Guidance for External PSK Usage in TLS       March 2020


   In addition to linkability in the network, external PSKs are
   intrinsically linkable by PSK receivers.  Specifically, servers can
   link successive connections that use the same external PSK together.
   Preventing this type of linkability is out of scope, as PSKs are
   explicitly designed to support mutual authentication.

6.  External PSK Use Cases and Provisioning Processes

   Pre-shared Key (PSK) ciphersuites were first specified for TLS in
   2005.  Now, PSK is an integral part of the TLS version 1.3
   specification [RFC8446].  TLS 1.3 also uses PSKs for session
   resumption.  It distinguishes these resumption PSKs from external
   PSKs which have been provisioned out-of-band (OOB).  Below, we list
   some example use-cases where pair-wise external PSKs with TLS have
   been used for authentication.

   *  Device-to-device communication with out-of-band synchronized keys.
      PSKs provisioned out-of-band for communicating with known
      identities, wherein the identity to use is discovered via a
      different online protocol.

   *  Intra-data-center communication.  Machine-to-machine communication
      within a single data center or PoP may use externally provisioned
      PSKs, primarily for the purposes of supporting TLS connections
      with fast open (0-RTT data).

   *  Certificateless server-to-server communication.  Machine-to-
      machine communication may use externally provisioned PSKs,
      primarily for the purposes of establishing TLS connections without
      requiring the overhead of provisioning and managing PKI
      certificates.

   *  Internet of Things (IoT) and devices with limited computational
      capabilities.  [RFC7925] defines TLS and DTLS profiles for
      resource-constrained devices and suggests the use of PSK
      ciphersuites for compliant devices.  The Open Mobile Alliance
      Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification [LwM2M]
      states that LwM2M servers MUST support the PSK mode of DTLS.

   *  Use of PSK ciphersuites are optional when securing RADIUS
      [RFC2865] with TLS as specified in [RFC6614].

   *  The Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) defined by 3GGP
      mentions that TLS-PSK can be used between a server and user
      equipment for authentication [GAA].

   *  Smart Cards.  The electronic German ID (eID) card supports

Internet-Draft   Guidance for External PSK Usage in TLS       March 2020


      authentication of a card holder to online services with TLS-PSK
      [SmartCard].

   There are also use cases where PSKs are shared between more than two
   entities.  Some examples below (as noted by Akhmetzyanova et
   al.[Akhmetzyanova]):

   *  Group chats.  In this use-case, the membership of a group is
      confirmed by the possession of a PSK distributed out-of-band to
      the group participants.  Members can then establish peer-to-peer
      connections with each other using the external PSK.  It is
      important to note that any node of the group can behave as a TLS
      client or server.

   *  Internet of Things (IoT).  In this use-case, resource-constrained
      IoT devices act as TLS clients and share the same PSK.  The
      devices use this PSK for quickly establishing connections with a
      central server.  Such a scheme ensures that the client IoT devices
      are legitimate members of the system.  To perform rare system
      specific operations that require a higher security level, the
      central server can request resource-intensive client
      authentication with the usage of a certificate after successfully
      establishing the connection with a PSK.

6.1.  Provisioning Examples

   *  Many industrial protocols assume that PSKs are distributed and
      assigned manually via one of the following approaches: typing the
      PSK into the devices, or via web server masks (using a Trust On
      First Use (TOFU) approach with a device completely unprotected
      before the first login did take place).  Many devices have very
      limited UI.  For example, they may only have a numeric keypad or
      even less number of buttons.  When the TOFU approach is not
      suitable, entering the key would require typing it on a
      constrained UI.  Moreover, PSK production lacks guidance unlike
      user passwords.

   *  Some devices are provisioned PSKs via an out-of-band, cloud-based
      syncing protocol.

   *  Some secrets may be baked into or hardware or software device
      components.  Moreover, when this is done at manufacturing time,
      secrets may be printed on labels or included in a Bill of
      Materials for ease of scanning or import.

6.2.  Provisioning Constraints

   PSK provisioning systems are often constrained in application-
   specific ways.  For example, although one goal of provisioning is to
   ensure that each pair of nodes has a unique key pair, some systems do
   not want to distribute pair-wise shared keys to achieve this.  As
   another example, some systems require the provisioning process to
   embed application-specific information in either PSKs or their
   identities.  Identities may sometimes need to be routable, as is
   currently under discussion for EAP-TLS-PSK.

6.3.  Stack Interfaces

   Most major TLS implementations support external PSKs.  And all have a
   common interface that applications may use when supplying them for
   individual connections.  Details about existing stacks at the time of
   writing are below.

   *  OpenSSL and BoringSSL: Applications specify support for external
      PSKs via distinct ciphersuites.  They also then configure
      callbacks that are invoked for PSK selection during the handshake.
      These callbacks must provide a PSK identity (as a character
      string) and key (as a byte string).  (If no identity is provided,
      a default one is assumed.)  They are typically invoked with a PSK
      hint, i.e., the hint provided by the server as per [RFC4279].  The
      PSK length is validated to be between [1, 256] bytes upon
      selection.

   *  mbedTLS: Client applications configure PSKs before creating a
      connection by providing the PSK identity and value inline.
      Servers must implement callbacks similar to that of OpenSSL.  PSK
      lengths are validate to be between [1, 16] bytes.

   *  gnuTLS: Applications configure PSK values, either as raw byte
      strings or hexadecimal strings.  The PSK size is not validated.

   *  wolfSSL: Applications configure PSKs with callbacks similar to
      OpenSSL.

6.3.1.  PSK Identity encoding and comparison

   Section 5.1 of [RFC4279] mandates that the PSK identity should be
   first converted to a character string and then encoded to octets
   using UTF-8.  This was done to avoid interoperability problems
   (especially when the identity is configured by human users).  On the
   other hand, [RFC7925] advises implementations against assuming any
   structured format for PSK identities and recommends byte-by-byte
   comparison for any operations.  TLS version 1.3 [RFC8446] follows the

Internet-Draft   Guidance for External PSK Usage in TLS       March 2020


   same practice of specifying the psk identity as a sequence of opaque
   bytes (shown as opaque identity<1..2^16-1>).

   Other assumptions unique to different stacks are listed below.

   *  Implementations such as OpenSSL and mbedTLS nonetheless treat
      psk_identities as character strings and use string operators such
      as "strcmp" on the psk identity.

   *  Implementations also assign default identities to PSKs (for
      example, the string 'Client_identity') if none are configured.

   *  gnuTLS treats psk identities as usernames.

   *  OpenSSL servers accept connections from clients that have a valid
      PSK even if the identity provided by the client is incorrect.
