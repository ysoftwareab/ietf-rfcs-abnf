A Publication Protocol for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
                     draft-ietf-sidr-publication-07

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for publishing Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) objects.  Even though the RPKI will have many
   participants issuing certificates and creating other objects, it is
   operationally useful to consolidate the publication of those objects.
   This document provides the protocol for doing so.

1.  Introduction

   This document assumes a working knowledge of the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI), which is intended to support improved routing
   security on the Internet.  [RFC6480]

   In order to make participation in the RPKI easier, it is helpful to
   have a few consolidated repositories for RPKI objects, thus saving
   every participant from the cost of maintaining a new service.
   Similarly, relying parties using the RPKI objects will find it faster
   and more reliable to retrieve the necessary set from a smaller number
   of repositories.

Internet-Draft          RPKI Publication Protocol         September 2015


   These consolidated RPKI object repositories will in many cases be
   outside the administrative scope of the organization issuing a given
   RPKI object.  In some cases, outsourcing operation of the repository
   will be an explicit goal: some resource holders who strongly wish to
   control their own RPKI private keys may lack the resources to operate
   a 24x7 repository, or may simply not wish to do so.

   The operator of an RPKI publication repository may well be an
   Internet registry which issues certificates to its customers, but it
   need not be; conceptually, operation of a an RPKI publication
   repository is separate from operation of RPKI CA.

   This document defines an RPKI publication protocol which allows
   publication either within or across organizational boundaries, and
   which makes fairly minimal demands on either the CA engine or the
   publication service.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "Publication engine" and "publication server" are used
   interchangeably to refer to the server providing the service
   described in this document.

   "Business Public Key Infrastructure" ("Business PKI" or "BPKI")
   refers to a PKI, separate from the RPKI, used to authenticate clients
   to the publication engine.  We use the term "Business PKI" here
   because an internet registry might already have a PKI for
   authenticating its clients and might wish to reuse that PKI for this
   protocol.  There is, however, no requirement to reuse such a PKI.

2.  Protocol Specification

   The publication protocol uses XML messages wrapped in signed CMS
   messages, carried over HTTP transport.

   The publication protocol uses a simple request/response interaction.
   The client passes a request to the server, and the server generates a
   corresponding response.

   A message exchange commences with the client initiating an HTTP POST
   with content type of "application/rpki-publication", with the message
   object as the body.  The server's response will similarly be the body
   of the response with a content type of "application/rpki-
   publication".

Internet-Draft          RPKI Publication Protocol         September 2015


   The content of the POST and the server's response will be a well-
   formed Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] object with OID =
   1.2.840.113549.1.7.2 as described in Section 3.1 of [RFC6492].

2.1.  Common XML Message Format

   The XML schema for this protocol is below in Section 2.7.  The basic
   XML message format looks like this:

   <msg
       type="query"
       version="3"
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/publication-spec/">
     <!-- Zero or more PDUs -->
   </msg>

   <msg
       type="reply"
       version="3"
       xmlns="http://www.hactrn.net/uris/rpki/publication-spec/">
     <!-- Zero or more PDUs -->
   </msg>

   Common attributes:

   version:  The value of this attribute is the version of this
      protocol.  This document describes version 3.

   type:  The possible values of this attribute are "reply" and "query".

   A query PDU may be one of three types: <publish/>, <withdraw/>, or
   <list/>.

   A reply PDU may be one of four types: <publish/>, <withdraw/>,
   <list/>, or <report_error/>.

   Each of these PDUs may include an optional tag to facilitate bulk
   operation.  If a tag is set in a query PDU, the corresponding
   reply(s) or error(s) MUST have the tag attribute set to the same
   value.

2.2.  General Operation

   Processing of a query message is handled atomically: either the
   entire query succeeds or none of it does.  When a query message
   contains multiple PDUs, failure of any PDU may require the server to
   roll back actions triggered by earlier PDUs.

2.3.  Publication and Withdrawal

   The publication protocol uses a common message format to request
   publication of any RPKI object.  This format was chosen specifically
   to allow this protocol to accommodate new types of RPKI objects
   without needing changes to this protocol.

   Both the <publish/> and <withdraw/> PDUs have a payload of an
   optional tag and a URI.  The <publish/> query also contains the DER
   object to be published, encoded in Base64.

   Both the <publish/> and <withdraw/> PDUs also have a "hash"
   attribute, which carries a hash of an existing object at the
   specified repository URI.  For <withdraw/> PDUs, the hash is
   mandatory, as this operation makes no sense if there is no existing
   object to withdraw.  For <publish/> PDUs, the hash MUST be present if
   the publication operation is overwriting an existing object, and MUST
   be omitted if this publication operation is writing to a new URI
   where no prior object exists.  Presence of an object when no hash
   attribute is specified is an error, as is absence of the hash
   attribute or an incorrect hash value when an object is present.  Any
   such errors MUST be reported using the <report_error/> PDU.

   The hash algorithm is SHA-256 [SHS], to simplify comparison of
   publication protocol hashes with RPKI manifest hashes.

   The intent behind the hash attribute is to allow the client and
   server to detect any disagreements about the effect that a <publish/>
   or <withdraw/> PDU will have on the repository.

   Note that every publish and withdraw action requires a new manifest,
   thus every publish or withdraw action will involve at least two
   objects.

2.4.  Listing the repository

   The <list/> operation allows the client to ask the server for a
   complete listing of objects which the server believes the client has
   published.  This is intended primarily to allow the client to recover
   upon detecting (probably via use of the "hash" attribute, see
   Section 2.3) that they have somehow lost synchronization.

   The <list/> query consists of a single PDU.

   The <list/> reply consists of zero or more PDUs, one per object
   published in this repository by this client, each PDU conveying the
   URI and hash of one published object.

2.5.  Error handling

   Errors are handled at two levels.

   Errors that make it impossible to decode a query or encode a response
   are handled at the HTTP layer.  4xx and 5xx HTTP response codes
   indicate that something bad happened.

   In all other cases, errors result in an XML <report_error/> PDU which
   takes the place of the expected protocol response PDU.  Like the rest
   of this protocol, <report_error/> PDUs are CMS-signed XML messages
   and thus can be archived to provide an audit trail.

   <report_error/> PDUs only appear in replies, never in queries.

   Like all other reply PDUs, if a "tag" attribute was set on the query
   that generated the error, the <report_error/> PDU MUST have its tag
   attribute set to the same value.

   The error itself is conveyed in the error_code attribute.  The value
   of this attribute is a token indicating the specific error that
   occurred.

   The body of the <report_error/> element contains two sub-elements:

   1.  An optional text element <error_text/>, which if present,
       contains a text string with debugging information intended for
       human consumption.

   2.  An optional element <failed_pdu/>, which, if present, contains a
       verbatim copy of the query PDU whose failure triggered the
       <report_error/> PDU.  The quoted element must be syntactically
       valid.

   The position of a <report_error/> element in a reply corresponds to
   the point in processing the query message where the error occurred.
   In the simple case of a query message containing only a single
   element, the <report_error/> element will be the only element in the
   reply.  If, however, the query message contains more than one
   element, the <report_error/> element may be preceeded by normal
   responses indicating operations that would have succeeded.

   There are several ways that a client can match up elements in a
   response message with the corresponding elements in the query
   message:

   o  For a one-element query, this is trivial.

Internet-Draft          RPKI Publication Protocol         September 2015


   o  For multi-element queries, the simplest way of matching resposes
      uses the optional tag attribute.  The protocol requires tags from
      query elements to be copied into reply elements, so simply giving
      each query element a unique tag will suffice.

   o  If for some reason the client implementation is not able or
      willing to use unique tags within a multi-element query message,
      the client can still match queries to responses by counting
      elements in the reply message.  This approach is not recommended.

   See Section 3.8 for examples of a multi-element query and responses.

2.6.  Error Codes

   These are the defined error codes as well as some discussion of each.
   Text similar to these descriptions may be sent in an <error_text/>
   element to help explain the error encountered.

   permission_failure:  Client does not have permission to update this
      URI.

   bad_cms_signature:  Bad CMS signature.

   object_already_present:  An object is already present at this URI,
      yet a hash attribute was not specified.  A hash attribute must be
      specified when overwriting or deleting an object.  Perhaps client
      and server are out of sync?

   no_object_present:  There is no object present at this URI, yet a
      hash attribute was specified.  Perhaps client and server are out
      of sync?

   no_object_matching_hash  The hash attribute supplied does not match
      the hash attribute of the object at this URI.  Perhaps client and
      server are out of sync?

   consistency_problem:  Server detected an update that looks like it
      will cause a consistency problem (e.g. an object was deleted, but
      the manifest was not updated).  Note that a server is not required
      to make such checks.  Indeed, it may be unwise for a server to do
      so.  This error code just provides a way for the server to explain
      its (in-)action.

   other_error:  A meteor fell on the server.

4.  Operational Considerations

   There are two basic options open to the repository operator as to how
   the publication tree is laid out.  The first option is simple: each
   publication client is given its own directory one level below the top
   of the rsync module, and there is no overlap between the publication
   spaces used by different clients.  For example:

   rsync://example.org/rpki/Alice/
   rsync://example.org/rpki/Bob/
   rsync://example.org/rpki/Carol/

Internet-Draft          RPKI Publication Protocol         September 2015


   This has the advantage of being very easy for the publication
   operator to manage, but has the drawback of making it difficult for
   relying parties to fetch published objects both safely and as
   efficiently as possible.

   Given that the mandatory-to-implement retrieval protocol for relying
   parties is rsync, a more efficient repository structure would be one
   which minimized the number of rsync fetches required.  One such
   structure would be one in which the publication directories for
   subjects were placed underneath the publication directories of their
   issuers: since the normal synchronization tree walk is top-down, this
   can significantly reduce the total number of rsync connections
   required to synchronize.  For example:

   rsync://example.org/rpki/Alice/
   rsync://example.org/rpki/Alice/Bob/
   rsync://example.org/rpki/Alice/Bob/Carol/

   Preliminary measurement suggests that, in the case of large numbers
   of small publication directories, the time needed to set up and tear
   down individual rsync connections becomes significant, and that a
   properly optimized tree structure can reduce synchronization time by
   an order of magnitude.

   The more complex tree structure does require careful attention to the
   base_uri attribute values when setting up clients.  In the example
   above, assuming that Alice issues to Bob who in turn issues to Carol,
   Alice has ceded control of a portion of her publication space to Bob,
   who has in turn ceded a portion of that to Carol, and the base_uri
   attributes in the <client/> setup messages should reflect this.

   The details of how the repository operator determines that Alice has
   given Bob permission to nest Bob's publication directory under
   Alice's is outside the scope of this protocol.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the application/rpki-publication MIME media
   type as follows:

6.  Security Considerations

   The RPKI publication protocol and the data it publishes use entirely
   separate PKIs for authentication.  The published data is
   authenticated within the RPKI, and this protocol has nothing to do
   with that authentication, nor does it require that the published
   objects be valid in the RPKI.  The publication protocol uses a
   separate Business PKI (BPKI) to authenticate its messages.

   Each RPKI publication protocol message is CMS-signed.  Because of
   that protection at the application layer, this protocol does not
   require the use of HTTPS or other transport security mechanisms.

   Although the hashes used in the <publish/> and <withdraw/> PDUs are
   cryptographic strength, the digest algorithm was selected for
   convenience in comparing these hashes with the hashes that appear in
   RPKI manifests.  The hashes used in the <publish/> and <withdraw/>
   PDUs are not particularly security-sensitive, because these PDUs are
   protected by the CMS signatures.

   Compromise of a publication server, perhaps through mismanagement of
   BPKI keys, could lead to a denial-of-service attack on the RPKI.  An
   attacker gaining access to BPKI keys could use this protocol delete
   (withdraw) RPKI objects, leading to routing changes or failures.
   Accordingly, as in most PKIs, good key management practices are
   important.
