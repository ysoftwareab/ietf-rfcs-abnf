Abstract

    This draft describes an optional implementation technique within
    IS-IS [ISO90 , Cal90a , Cal90b ] used today by several ISPs for routing
    within their clouds.  IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocol
    developed originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as IGP. This
    draft describes how to encapsulate IS-IS packets in IPv4 [Pos81 ]
    format.  Such an encapsulation has many advantages, one of those
    being the possibility to run integrated IS-IS on anything that
    understands IPv4, including avian carriers [Wai90 ].  Encapsulation of
    IS-IS PDUs in IPv6 is outside the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

    Encapsulation of IS-IS as defined in ISO 10589 [ISO90 , Cal90a ,
    Cal90b] uses directly over Link Layer protocols as opposed to IP
    routing protocols [Moy97 ] that are encapsulated over IP directly.

Internet Draft                    IS-IS over IPv4                     Oct
1999

    By defining an encapsulation of IS-IS in IP, we save on special OSI
    encapsulation on several media types.  Such an encapsulation would
    solve fragmentation problems of large LSPs and remove the necessity
    for OSI PPP extensions [Kat92 ] when IS-IS is run over negotiated
    PPP links.  Additionally, on certain media, such as P2P ATM links,
    no LLC/SNAP encapsulation is necessary to provide multi-protocol
    routing, allowing for gains in efficiency.

2.  Encapsulation of IS-IS and ISO 9542 packets over IP

    IS-IS is encapsulated directly over the Internet Protocol's network
    layer.  IS-IS packets are therefore encapsulated by IP and local
    data-link headers.  Within this encapsulation, IS-IS packets are
    propagated as usual, however without the appropriate link-layer
    fields but starting at NLPI.

    IS-IS does not normally provide a way to transmit packets larger
    than MTU size.  This proposal allows to use IP fragmentation when
    transmitting such packets.  If necessary, the length of IS-IS packets
    over IP can be up to 65,535 bytes (including the IP header).  The
    IS-IS packet types that are likely to be large (LSPs, CSNPs, PSNPs)
    can usually be split into several separate protocol packets, without
    loss of functionality.  This is recommended; IP fragmentation SHOULD
    be avoided whenever possible since it can lead to different problems,
    such as loss of fragments causing the retransmission of complete IP
    packets.  Following rules apply:

     -  IIHs MUST not exceed the size of [InterfaceMT U  -  IP headersize]
         (1)  and have the DF bit set.  MTU size padding rules should be
        followed as described in ISO 10589.

     -  SNPs MUST NOT be larger than the respective
originatingLSPBufferSize.

     -  SNPs MUST be sent allowing IP fragmentation (DF bit not set).

     -  SNPs SHOULD NOT be larger than the minimum of [InterfaceMT U    -
        IP headersize] and respective originatingLSPBufferSize.

     -  LSP fragments MAY BE built with a size up to the value of
        corresponding originatingLSPBufferSize.

Internet Draft                    IS-IS over IPv4                     Oct
1999

     -  LSP fragments MUST NOT be larger than the respective
        originatingLSPBufferSize.

     -  LSPs MUST be sent allowing IP fragmentation (DF bit not set).

     -  LSP fragments SHOULD NOT exceed the size of the minimum of
        dataLinkBlockSize and respective originatingLSPBufferSize.

    This set of rules allows to configure a network with respective
    originatingLSPBufferSize larger than some interfaces' MTUs.
    In a mixed environment, care must be taken that respective
    originatingLSPBufferSize does net exceed the MTU size of interfaces
    without IP encapsulation.  A default originatingLSPBufferSize of 1472
    is recommended.

    The other important features of IS-IS in IP's IP encapsulation are:

     -  IS-IS in IP has been assigned IP protocol number 124.  IP
        protocol number assignments are documented in [RP94 ].

        Historical      note:  For development purposes, IP Protocol number
        9 (Private IGP protocol number) [RP94 ] has been used until an
        official number was granted.

     -  Use of IP multicast.  Some IS-IS in IP messages are multicast,
        when sent over broadcast networks.  Three distinct IP multicast
        addresses are used.  Packets sent to these multicast addresses
        should never be forwarded; they are meant to travel a single hop
        only.  To ensure that these packets will not travel multiple
        hops, their IP TTL must be set to 1.

           IPAllL1ISs

               OSI multicast value of this address was O1-80-C2-00-00-14.
               This multicast address has been assigned the IP address
               value 224.0.0.19 for IP encapsulated IS-IS. All routers
               running L1 IS-IS in IP should be prepared to receive
               packets sent to this address.  Hello packets are always
               sent to this destination.  Also, certain IS-IS in IP
               protocol packets are sent to this address during the
               flooding procedure.

           IPAllL2ISs

               OSI multicast value of this address was O1-80-C2-00-00-15.
               This multicast address has been assigned the IP address
               value 224.0.0.20 for IP encapsulated IS-IS. All routers
               running L2 IS-IS in IP should be prepared to receive
               packets sent to this address.  Hello packets are always
               sent to this destination.  Also, certain IS-IS in IP
               protocol packets are sent to this address during the
               flooding procedure.

           IPAllIntermediateSystems

               OSI multicast value of this address was 09-00-2B-0O-00-05.
               This multicast address has been assigned the IP address
               value 224.0.0.21 for IP encapsulated IS-IS. All routers
               running IS-IS in IP should be prepared to receive packets
               sent to this address.  ISO 9542 is using this address.

     -  All IS-IS in IP routing protocol packets are sent using the
        normal service TOS value of binary 0000 defined in [Alm92 ].

     -  Routing protocol packets are sent with IP precedence set to
        Internetwork Control.  IS-IS in IP protocol packets should be
        given precedence over regular IP data traffic, in both sending
        and receiving.  Setting the IP precedence field in the IP header
        to Internetwork Control [Pos81 ] may help to implement this
        objective.

3.  Internal Encapsulation

    On point-to-point links no MAC addresses are used by IS-IS. Therefore
    the Intradomain Routeing Protocol Discriminator or ISO 9542 Network
    Layer Protocol Identifier starts directly after the IP header.
    For P2P link running PPP, the Payload format will consist of PPP
    header, followed by the IP header and the usual NLPID as indicated in
    figure 1.

    For P2P ATM links using VC muxing, the payload format MUST NOT
    include the PPP header as indicated in figure 2.

    In the case of broadcast media, MAC addresses are used for adjacency
    identification.  It is rather painful from the implementation
    perspective to assume that an IS-IS must have access to MAC headers

    when receiving frames.  However, based on the observation that
    ethernets have at least one IP address assigned, MAC address
    necessary for adjacency maintenance can be built algorithmically
    using the source address of the IP packet received.  To prevent
    collisions with universally administered addresses, the addresses
    are designated by having bit one in byte zero of the MAC set to 1 to
    indicate locally administered address as specified by the according
    IEEE standard.  When receiving an IP encapsulated ISIS PDU, the
    artificial MAC address is assumed to consist (in network order) of
    4 bytes of source IP address aligned as least significant bytes,
    ``locally administered'' bit being set and all remaining bits being
    zero.  Figure 3 visualizes such an address for a source IP address
    128.127.128.1.

Internet Draft                    IS-IS over IPv4                     Oct
1999

    When operating on an interface encapsulating IS-IS within IP,
    encapsulated PDUs MUST be sent with a constant IP source address.
    Any change of the IP address on the interface MUST be considered
    equivalent to change of MAC address in ISO mode.  In all places in
    which MAC addresses are being used in ISO mode, source IP address
    MUST be used to compute artificial MACs when sending and parsing
    received PDUs.

    Any PDU received on IP encapsulated broadcast interface and
    containing MACs with either the ``locally administered'' bit not
    being set or any of the remaining bits in the first two bytes being
    set SHOULD be discarded.

4.  Interoperability with Devices without IP Encapsulation

    An interoperability solution for devices using IP encapsulation and
    OSI encapsulation of ISIS frames would be only useful if it could
    significantly ease the migration path in the existing networks.
    Given the fact that graceful migration is not a paramount issue for
    existing networks and any solution would invariably lead to the
    problem of partitioning of broadcast media, such a solution is not
    defined.
