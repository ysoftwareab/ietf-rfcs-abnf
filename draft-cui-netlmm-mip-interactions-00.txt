Internet-Draft   Interactions between PMIPv6 and DSMIPv6   November 2009


1. Introduction

   This document proposes two detailed solutions for a mobile node which
   is roaming between PMIPv6 and DSMIPv6.  In this scenario the HA and
   LMA are separately deployed in different networks.

   When a mobile node is roaming from DSMIPv6 domain to PMIPv6 domain,
   in order to ensure the connectivity of MN's communications, the
   mobile node must re-register to the HA with a new care-of-address.
   There are two ways to resolve the problem. One way is that when the
   MN gets the PMIPv6-HoA from the MAG, it re-registers to the HA with
   the PMIPv6-HoA as a CoA. The other way is that the LMA will register
   to the HA with one of its own addresses instead of the attached
   mobile node.

   This document also defines some option and mechanisms for use in the
   solutions. These extensions are optional extensions, but they can
   help to implement the interaction system.



2. Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   The Mobile-IP-related and Proxy-Mobile-IP-related terminology used in
   this document are described in RFC 3344 [3] and RFC 5213 [2]. The
   dynamics home agent assignment related terminology used in this
   document are described in RFC 4433[4].  In addition, the following
   terms are used:

   DSMIPV6: dual stack mobile IPv6

   DSMIPv6-HoA: the Home Address the MN includes in DSMIPv6 binding
   update messages

   PMIPv6-HoA: the Home Address assigned by the LMA, in our scenario
   PMIPv6-HoA is equal to DSMIPv6-HoA

   LMAA: the address of LMA

3. Scenario Description

   There are three scenarios described in [6]. Scenario A is that the
   Mobile IPv6 Home Agent (HA) and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (LMA) are separate
   and the whole network is made up of PMIPv6 domains. Scenario B and C
   is that the HA and LMA are merged as a common mobility anchor, and
   the difference between the two scenarios is scenario B including only
   PMIPv6 domain but scenario C with Non-PMIPv6 domain. However, in our
   opinion, there should be four scenarios base on whether the HA and
   LMA are separate or merged and whether the Non-PMIPv6 domain is
   included. So besides the above-mentioned three scenarios, there must
   be another scenario D which is the HA and LMA is separate and the
   network is made up of PMIPv6 domain and Non-PMIPv6 domain.

   We believe scenario D is more reasonable and practical. The MIPv6
   should be deployed in the whole network and the PMIPv6 locally
   deployed. This scenario is easy to deploy and convenient to manage.
   Because the MAG can't be deployed everywhere, the request in scenario
   A which the whole network is only made up of PMIPv6 domain is not
   practical. It requires the whole network should consist of PMIPv6
   domain and Non-PMIPv6 domain. So scenario D is reasonable and used as
   our scenario.

   The figure 1 illustrates our scenario. In this scenario the HA and
   LMA are separately deployed, in other words HA and LMA are belongs
   to different networks. The interaction is similar to HIMIPv6; DSMIPv6
   is used as a global mobility management whereas PMIPv6 is used as
   local mobility management. The Non-PMIPv6 domain is also included in
   our scenario.  When a mobile node is roaming in DSMIPv6 domain, it
   uses the protocol of the DSMIPv6. The same mechanism is used when the
   mobile node is roaming only in the PMIPv6 domain. But when the mobile
   node is roaming from DSMIPv6 domain to PMIPv6 domain, the two
   solutions described in this document can be used to re-register to
   the HA.

4. Solution One - simple interaction

   This solution is much like the one proposed in [6] related to
   scenario A. The difference between the two solutions is that the Non-
   PMIPv6 domain is introduce into our scenario. In this simple
   interaction solution, the mobile node is managed by DSMIPv6 protocol
   when it is roaming only in the Non-PMIPv6 domain (DSMIPv6 domain) and
   the same to the PMIPv6 domain. However, when the mobile node is
   roaming from Non-PMIPv6 domain to PMIPv6 domain or from one PMIPv6
   domain to another, the mobile node should re-register to the HA. The
   re-register process should be performed as the figure for global
   mobility message flow which is defined in [6]. When the mobile node
   is roaming from PMIPv6 domain to Non-PMIPv6 domain, the message flow
   is shown as figure 2.

     Figure 2: Message Flow for MN's roaming from PMIPv6 to Non-PMIPv6



   Firstly, as the step 1 and 2 shown, the MAG will discover that the MN
   has been gone, and it will send a PBU to revoke the binding for MN at
   the LMA. The LMA will send a PBA to confirm the revocation. The step
   from 3 to 6 describe the process of the re-register to HA as the
   MIPv6[5] defines.

5. Solution Two - complex interaction

   In this complex interaction solution, when a mobile node is roaming
   from DSMIPv6 domain to PMIPv6 domain using DSMIPv6-HoA, LMA should
   receive all the packets sent to MN and then forward them to MN via
   MAG. When the MN attach to the MAG, the registration to HA will be
   accomplished by the LMA instead of MN, and the care-of-address option
   includes in the Binding Update will be filled with the LMAA. Then a
   tunnel between the LMA and HA will be established. All the packets
   sent to MN will be forwarded through the tunnel.

5.1. Extension of Proxy Binding Update

   The HA Address Option, shown in Figure 2, contains the address of the
   HA.  This extension is used in PBU to tell LMA who is the MN's HA. It
   MAY be an optional extension.

5.2. Messaging Mechanism for PMIPv6-DSMIPv6 Interactions

   This specification presents the messaging mechanism for MN's roaming
   from DSMIPv6 domain to the PMIPv6 domain and the opposite direction.

5.2.1. Roaming from DSIMPv6 to PMIPv6

   Detailed explanation of the process is best described with the help
   of a message flow diagram and description. Figure 3 shows the process
   of a MN roams from DSMIPv6 to PMIPv6.

       Figure 4: Message Flow for MN's roaming from DSMIPv6 to PMIPv6

   1. Firstly the MN sends BU and revokes the binding by setting the
   lifetime field to 0 and by setting the care-of address equal to the
   home address

   2. The HA receives the binding revocation and knows that the MN has
   left then HA will delete all the resources related to the MN.

   3. The MN entered the PMIPv6 domain and MAY send a Router
   Solicitation to the MAG if it does not receive any Router
   Advertisements for certain time.

   4. The MAG will send PBU to the LMA for MN while it detects the MN's
   enter.

   5. The LMA will send back a PBA once the PBU is accepted and a bi-
   directional tunnel between MAG and LMA is also established.

   6. At the same time the LMA will send a BU to the HA for MN and
   register the LMAA as MN's new CoA.

   7. The HA will send back BA if the BU is accepted and a bi-
   directional tunnel will be established between LMA and HA.

5.2.2. Roaming from PMIPv6 to DSIMPv6

   The process of a MN roams from PMIPv6 to DSMIPv6 is the same as the
   figure 2 shown in 3.2.

5.3. Mobility Agent Considerations

   The following sections describe the behavior of each mobility agent
   in detail.

5.3.1. Mobile Node Considerations

   The mobile node does not have any special behavior beyond a dual
   stack mobile node.

5.3.2. Mobility Access Gateway Considerations

   The MAG MAY get the HA address of attached MN, the method may be a
   static way such as reading from a Strategy Document and this is out
   the scope of this document.

   The MAG can send the HA address to the LMA used HA Address Option
   while registering to LMA and LMA can also reject this option.

5.3.3. Local Mobile Anchor Considerations

   The LMA MUST be able to send binding update to the HA for MN.
   The MAG may include the HA address option in the proxy binding update
   while it Registers to the LMA for MN. A valid unicast IPv6 address
   MUST be used as LMA address in this extension. The LMA will registers
   to the HA for MN while it accepts the PBU from MAG, so the LMA must
   be able to generate and send the binding update packet to the HA
   specified by MAG.


6. Security Considerations

   This specification assumes that a security configuration has been
   preconfigured between the LMA and the MAG. The Assigned LMA
   authenticates each Proxy Binding Update from the MAG. The MAG also
   authenticates the Proxy Binding Apply from the Assigned LMA.

7. IANA Considerations

   The HA Address Option is a new defined extension.
