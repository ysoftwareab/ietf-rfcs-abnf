Abstract

   A Fibre Channel pseudowire (PW) is used to carry Fibre Channel frames
   over an MPLS network. This enables service providers to take full
   advantage of the reliable transport of MPLS-TE/MPLS-TP to offer
   "emulated" Fibre Channel services. This document specifies the
   encapsulation of Fibre Channel PDUs within a pseudowire. It also
   specifies the common procedures for using a PW to provide a Fibre
   Channel service. The mechanisms controlling the reliable transport of
   Fibre Channel PW over MPLS networks can be provided by MPLS-TP.

Internet-Draft            FC Encapsulation               February 2010


  1. Introduction

   Fibre Channel Storage Area Networks (SAN) extension for disaster
   recovery has become an important potential source of network traffic.
   In order to meet Fibre Channel's network service requirements, such
   as transparency and low latency, multiple methods for encapsulating
   and transporting FC frames over backbone networks have been developed
   [FC-BB].

   FC/IP, as described in [RFC3821] and [FC-BB], interconnects otherwise
   isolated FC SANs over IP Networks. FC/IP uses FC Frame Encapsulation,
   [RFC3643] to encapsulate FC frames and addresses concerns specific to
   tunneling FC over an IP-based network. Since such networks do not
   reliably deliver packets, FC/IP relies on the TCP protocol to
   retransmit dropped frames. Due to possible delay variation and TCP
   re-transmission timeouts, special timing mechanisms are required to
   ensure correct Fibre Channel operation over FC/IP [FC-BB].

   MPLS-TP and MPLS-TE provide mechanisms for reliable transport over
   MPLS networks, making it possible for Fibre Channel ports to be
   interconnected directly over MPLS networks. A Fibre Channel
   pseudowire (FC PW) is a method to transparently transport FC frames
   over an MPLS network resulting in behavior similar to that of two FC
   ports are directly connected by a physical link. The result is
   considerably simpler control processing at both Ingress and Egress by
   comparison to FC/IP.

   This document defines the encapsulation of FC Protocol Data Units
   (PDU) into an MPLS pseudowire and related procedures for using PW
   encapsulation.  The following sections describe some of the key
   requirements for transporting FC frames over an MPLS PSN.

1.1. Transparency

   Transparent emulation of an FC link is a key requirement for
   transporting FC frames over a carrier's network. This requires the FC
   PW to emulate an FC Link between two FC ports, similar to the
   approach defined for FC over GFPT in [FC-BB]. This results in
   transparent forwarding of FC frames over the MPLS PSN from both the
   FC Fabric and the operator's points of view.

   Transparency distinguishes the FC PW approach from FC/IP. An FC PW
   logically connects the FC port on one end of PW directly with the FC
   port on the other end of PW, whereas FC/IP introduces FC B_Ports at
   both ends of the extended FC link; each FC B_Port is logically
   connected to the FC port on the same side of the link extension.

1.2. Bandwidth Efficiency

   The bandwidth allocated to PW can be less than the rate of the
   attached FC port. When there is no data exchange between the two
   directly connected FC ports, Idle Primitive signals are continuously
   exchanged between the two FC ports to keep the FC Link up. In order
   to improve the bandwidth efficiency across the MPLS network, it is
   necessary for PW PE to suppress (or drop) the Idle Primitive signals
   generated by its adjacent FC ports. The far end PW PE regenerates
   Idle Primitive signals to send to its adjacent FC port as necessary,
   see [FC-BB].

   FC link protocols may send the same FC Primitive Sequence [FC-FS-2]
   between two directly connected FC ports until a reply is received. To
   improve bandwidth efficiency, the PW PE only encapsulates a subset of
   the received repetitive FC Primitive Sequences to send across the PW
   tunnel [FC-BB]. E.g., one out of each set of four identical received
   primitives is sent across the MPLS network. The far end PW PE has to
   send the Primitive Sequences received from the WAN side, i.e. from PW
   tunnel, to its attached FC port continuously until a new primitive
   sequence or data frame is received from the WAN.

   Another requirement for transporting FC over an MPLS PSN is to
   minimize the protocol overhead to optimize the bandwidth consumed by
   the FC traffic. FC PW has an overhead of 16 bytes, consisting of the
   FC Encapsulation Header (4 bytes), the Control Word (4 bytes), the PW
   label (4 bytes) and the MPLS label (4 bytes).

  2. Reference Model

   FC PW allows FC Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to be carried over an MPLS
   network. In addressing the issues associated with carrying a FC PDU
   over an MPLS network, this document assumes that a pseudowire can be
   provisioned statically or through signaling protocol as defined in
   [RFC4447].

   FC PW emulates a single FC link between exactly two endpoints. This
   document specifies the emulated PW encapsulation for FC. Figure 1
   describes the reference models which are derived from [RFC3985] to
   support the FC PW emulated services. FC PDUs are received by PE1's FC
   attachment channel, encapsulated at PE1, transported across MPLS
   network, decapsulated at PE2, and transmitted onward via the PE2's FC
   attachment channel.

   The Native Service Processing (NSP) function includes

      - suppressing the FC Idle frames received from the PE's attached
         FC port,

      - re-generating the Idle frames and send to its attached FC port
         when there is no FC data frames are received from PW WAN side,

      - selecting a subset of repetitive FC Primitive Sequences
         received from its attached FC port and passing them to the PW
         Termination Entity for both encapsulation and forwarding to the
         PW tunnel, and

      - sending the received FC Primitive Sequence received from the PW
         tunnel to PE's attachment FC port continuously until a new
         frame is received from PW tunnel.

   The NSP function is specified in detail by [FC-BB].

  3. Encapsulation

   This specification provides port to port transport of FC encapsulated
   traffic. There are several port types defined by Fibre Channel,
   including:

       An N_port is a port on the node (e.g. host or storage device)
        used with both FC-P2P or FC-SW topologies. Also known as Node
        port.

       An NL_port is a port on the node used with an FC-AL topology.
        Also known as Node Loop port.

       An F_port is a port on the switch that connects to a node point-
        to-point (i.e. connects to an N_port). Also known as Fabric
        port. An F_port is not loop capable.

       An FL_port is a port on the switch that connects to a FC-AL loop
        (i.e. to NL_ports). Also known as Fabric Loop port.

       E_port is the connection between two fibre channel switches.
        Also known as an Expansion port. When E_ports between two
        switches form a link, that link is referred to as an inter-
        switch link (ISL).

   Among the port types listed above, only the following FC connections
   (as specified in [FC-BB]) are supported by an FC PW over MPLS:

          - N-Port to N-Port

          - N-Port to F-Port

          - E-Port to E-Port

   FC Primitive Signals and FC-Port Login handling by the NSP function
   within the PE is defined in [FC-BB].

   This FC PW specification is limited to use with FC service classes 2,
   3 and F (see [FC-FS-2]).  Other FC service classes (e.g., 1, 4 and 6)
   MUST NOT be used with an FC PW.  This FC PW specification is limited
   to native FC attachment links that employ the 8b/10b transmission
   code used by FC (see [FC-FS-2]).  The protocol specified in this
   document is not sufficient to support attached FC links that use a
   64b/66b transmission code (e.g., 10GFC); such links MUST NOT be
   attached to an FC PW.

3.1. The Control Word

   The Generic PW Control Word, as defined in "PWE3 Control Word"
   [RFC4385] MUST be used for FC PW to facilitate the transport of short
   packets (by setting the Length field as detailed below), and convey
   the flag bit defined below. The structure of the Control Word is as
   follows:

                                  1                   2                   3
              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             |0 0 0 0| PT  |X|0 0|  Length   |     Sequence Number           |
             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Figure 3 - Control Word structure for the one-to-one mapping mode

   The first four bits of the PW Control Word MUST be set to 0 by the
   ingress PE to indicate PW data.

   The Flags bits are in use to convey the value of two flags, as
   specified below.

   PT - Payload Type indication. This field identifies the payload type
   carried within the PW PDU. The following types are defined:

           PT = 0: FC data frame.

           PT = 1: FC login frame.

           PT = 2: FC Primitive Sequence.

           PT = 6: FC Control Frame (refer to [FC-BB] for usage).

   X - This bit is not used by this version of the protocol. It SHOULD
   be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   The fragmentation bits (bits 8-9) are not used by the FC PW protocol.
   These bits may be used in the future for FC specific indications as
   defined in [RFC4385].

   The length field MUST be used for packets shorter than 64 bytes. Its
   processing must follow the rules defined in [RFC4385].

   The sequence number is not used for FC PW and MUST be set to 0 by the
   ingress PE, and MUST be ignored by the egress PE. Refer to section 6
   for the sequencing mechanism used for FC PW.

3.2. MTU Requirements

   The MPLS PSN MUST be able to transport the largest Fibre Channel
   encapsulation frame, including the overhead associated with the
   tunneling protocol. The maximum frame size without PW and MPLS labels
   (refer to Figure 4) is 2164 bytes. The MPLS PSN SHOULD accommodate
   frames of up to 2500 bytes to support future expansion of FC frames.

   Fragmentation, described in [RFC4623], SHALL NOT be used for FC PW,
   therefore the network MUST be configured with a minimum MTU that is
   sufficient to transport the largest encapsulation frame.

3.3. Mapping of FC traffic to PW PDU

   FC frames and Primitive Sequences are transported over the PW. All
   packet types are carried over a single PW. In addition to the PW
   Control Word, a FC Encapsulation Header has to be included in the
   frame. The FC Encapsulation Header is not used in this version of the
   protocol. This field SHOULD be set to zero by the sender and MUST be
   ignored by the receiver.

   Each FC frame is mapped to a PW PDU, including the Start Of Frame
   (SOF) delimiter, frame header, CRC field and the End Of Frame (EOF)
   delimiter, as shown in figure 4. The SOF and EOF frame delimiters are
   each encoded into a single byte as specified in [RFC3643], except the
   codes for delimiters that apply only to FC service class 4 (SOFi4,
   SOFc4, SOFn4, EOFdt, EOFdti, EOFrt, EOFrti) MUST NOT be used. The CRC
   in the frame is directly from FC attachment channel, so the PW PE is
   not required to re-calculate the CRC or to check the CRC in the
   received frame either.

      Figure 4 - FC frame (SOF/EOF/CRC/Data) encapsulation within PW PDU

   FC Primitive Sequences and Primitive Signals are encapsulated in a PW
   PDU containing the encoded K28.5 character [FC-BB], followed by the
   encoded 3 data characters, as shown in Figure 5. Each K28.5 - Dxx.y -
   Dxx.y - Dxx.y set of 4 octets represents an FC ordered set, which is
   either a primitive signal or a primitive sequence for the FC PW.  All
   FC ordered sets start with a K28.5 control character, but the three
   following Dxx.y data characters differ depending on the ordered set.
   Here are a couple of ordered set examples:

   - Receiver Ready (R_RDY) is K28.5 - D21.4 - D10.2 - D10.2 (this FC
   primitive signal is used for FC link flow control).
   - Link Reset Response(LRR) is K28.5 - D21.1 - D31.5 - D9.2 (this FC
   primitive sequence is used by FC link initialization and recovery
   protocols).

Internet-Draft            FC Encapsulation               February 2010


   The K28.5 10b control character received from the attached FC link is
   encoded for the FC PW as its 8b counterpart (0xBC).  The 8b encoding
   is also used to encode a D28.5 data word; the receiving PW PE MUST
   check for presence of an 8b K28.5 value (0xBC) at the start of each
   ordered set (see Figure 5), MUST send that value as a 10b K28.5
   character on the attached FC link, and MUST send the following 3
   Dxx.y 8b values as Dxx.y 10b characters on the attached FC link
   (i.e., Must not send the 3 Dxx.y 8b values as the 10b Kxx.y
   characters on the attached FC link).

   A PW PDU may contain one or more encoded FC Ordered sets [FC-BB]. The
   length field in the FC PW Control Word is used to indicate the packet
   length when the PW PDU contains multiple Ordered Sets.

   Idle Primitive Signals can be carried over the PW in the same manner
   as Primitive Sequences. However, [FC-BB] requires that Idle Primitive
   Signals be dropped by the Ingress PE and re-generated by the egress
   PE to save bandwidth consumed by FC (refer to [FC-BB] for further
   details).

   The egress PE extracts the Primitive Sequence or Primitive Signal
   from the received PW PDU. For a Primitive Sequence, the PE continues
   transmitting the same FC Ordered Set to its attachment FC port until
   a FC frame or another ordered set is received over the PW.  A

   Primitive Signal is sent once, except that Idle Primitive Signals are
   sent continuously when there is nothing else to send.

   FC Control frames are transported over the PW, by encapsulating each
   frame in a PW PDU. FC PW Control Word must have PT = 6. FC Control
   Frame payload is generated and terminated by the corresponding FC
   entity. How the FC Control Frame is generated and processed are
   defined in [FC-BB].

3.4. PW failure mapping

   PW failure mapping, which are detected through PW signaling failure,
   PW status notifications as defined in [RFC4447], or through PW OAM
   mechanisms MUST be mapped to emulated signal failure indications.
   Sending the FC link failure indication to its attachment FC channel
   is performed by the NSP, as defined by [FC-BB], and is out of the
   scope of this document.

4. Signaling of FC Pseudowires

   RFC4447 specifies the use of the MPLS Label Distribution Protocol,
   LDP, as a protocol for setting up and maintaining pseudowires. This
   section describes the use of specific fields and error codes used to
   control FC PW.

   The PW Type field in the PWid FEC element and PW generalized ID FEC
   elements MUST be set to "FC Port Mode" as requested in section 7
   below.


Black and Dunbar       Expires August 25, 2010                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            FC Encapsulation               February 2010


   The Control Word is REQUIRED for FC pseudowires.  Therefore the C-Bit
   in the PWid FEC element and PW generalized ID FEC elements MUST be
   set. If the C-Bit is not set the pseudowire MUST not be established
   and a Label Release MUST be sent with an "Illegal C-Bit" status code
   [RFC4447].

   The Fragmentation Indicator (Parameter ID = 0x09) is specified in
   [RFC4446] and its usage is defined in [RFC4623]. Since fragmentation
   is not used in FC PW, the fragmentation indicator parameter MUST be
   omitted from the Interface Parameter Sub-TLV.

5. Timing Considerations

   Correct Fibre Channel link operation requires that the latency
   between CE1 and CE2 (refer to Figure 1) be:

      a) no more than one-half of the R_T_TOV (Receiver Transmitter
   Timeout Value, default value: 100 milliseconds, defined in [FC-FS])
   of the attached devices for Primitive Sequences;

      b) no more than one-half of the E_D_TOV (Error Detect Timeout
   Value, default value: 2 seconds, defined in [FC-FS]) of the attached
   devices for frames; and

      c) within the R_A_TOV (Resource Allocation Timeout Value, default
   value: 10 seconds, defined in [FC-FS]) of the attached fabric(s), if
   any.

   An FC PW MUST adhere to these three timing requirements and MUST NOT
   be used in environments where high or variable latency may cause
   these requirements to be violated.

   Failure to adhere to requirement a) may result in FC link failures
   (e.g., FC link initialization protocol times out).  Failure to adhere
   to requirements b) and c) may cause incorrect Fibre Channel
   operation, including possible corruption of stored data when Fibre
   Channel is used to access storage systems.

   The PING and PING_ACK signals defined in Section 6.4.7 of [FC-BB] MAY
   be used to measure the current FC pseudowire latency between the CE
   devices.

   If the measured latency violates any of the above 3 requirements, the
   FC PW PE MUST generate a WAN Down event as specified in [FC-BB]. The
   WAN Down event causes the PE to continuously send NOS (an FC
   primitive sequence) on the native FC link to the attached FC Port
   (typically an E_Port on a switch in this case).  This immediately


Black and Dunbar       Expires August 25, 2010                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            FC Encapsulation               February 2010


   causes the FC link that is carried by the PW to be taken down,
   halting transmission of FC traffic.  However, it is not necessary to
   tear down the pseudowire itself (i.e., destroy the MPLS path set up
   by LDP).  The state machine in Section 6.4.2 of [FC-BB] specifies the
   protocol used to attempt to recover from the WAN Down event (i.e.,
   bring the WAN back up).  If that protocol brings the WAN back up, FC
   traffic will resume and the standard FC link recovery protocol will
   bring the carried FC link back up. If the previous pseudowire was
   destroyed, attempts will be made to re-establish the path via LDP as
   part of recovering from the WAN Down event.

   If the PW round-trip latency stays above 100ms, the initialization
   protocol for the FC PW will repeatedly time out in attempting to
   recover from the WAN Down event, preventing FC recovery of the FC
   link carried by the PW.

6. Security Considerations

   FC PW does not change the security properties of the underlying MPLS
   PSN, rather it relies upon the PSN's mechanisms for encryption,
   integrity, and authentication as required.

   FC PW shares susceptibility to a number of pseudowire-layer attacks
   and implementations SHOULD use whatever mechanisms for
   confidentiality, integrity, and authentication are developed for PWs
   in general.  These methods are beyond the scope of this document.

   The protocols used to implement security in a Fibre Channel fabric
   are defined in [FC-SP]. These protocols operate at higher layers of
   the FC hierarchy and are transparent to the FC PW.

7. Applicability Statement

   FC PW allows the transparent transport of point-to-point Fibre
   Channel ports while saving network bandwidth by removing or reducing
   the FC Idle Signals and Primitive Sequences.

   - The pair of CE devices operates as if they were directly connected
   by an FC link. In particular they react to Primitive Sequences on
   their local ACs in the standard way.

   - The FC PW carries only FC data frames and a single copy of a
   Primitive Sequence. Idle Primitive Signals encountered between FC
   data frames, and long streams of the same Primitive Sequence are
   suppressed over the PW thus saving bandwidth.




Black and Dunbar       Expires August 25, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            FC Encapsulation               February 2010


   - The PW PE MUST generate Idle Primitive Signals to the FC attachment
   channel when there is no frame transmitted across the MPLS network.

   FC PW traffic should only traverse through controlled MPLS or MPLS-TP
   networks. The network should enforce proper policing of incoming
   traffic and proper network resource/bandwidth allocation so that the
   FC PW delivery quality can be guaranteed. To extend FC across an
   uncontrolled network, FC/IP SHOULD be used instead of an FC PW.

   This document does not provide any mechanisms for protecting FC PW
   against PSN outages. As a consequence, resilience of the emulated
   service to such outages is dependent upon MPLS-TE/MPLS-TP network.
   However, the NSP MAY implement a mechanism to convey the PW status to
   the CE, to enable faster handling of the PSN outage.


8. IANA Considerations


   IANA is requested to assign a new PW type as follows:


      PW type      Description           Reference
      --------     --------------        ----------
      0x001F       FC Port Mode          [FC-encap]

   The above value is suggested as the next available value.

   [Editor's Note - is this necessary?] IANA should reserve the
   following Sub-TLV types which were tentatively allocated for FC PW.
   These Sub-TLV types were used for an FC PW Selective Retransmission
   protocol for FC PW, that the working group has decided to eliminate.
   This reservation action prevents future use of these values for other
   purposes, just in case there are implementations of the Selective
   Retransmission protocol.

      Parameter  ID Length
        ---------  ---------
        0x12          4
        0x13          4
        0x14          4
        0x15          4
