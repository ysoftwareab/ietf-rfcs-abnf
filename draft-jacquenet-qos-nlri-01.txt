               Abstract 
                   
                  This draft specifies an additional BGP4 (Border Gateway Protocol, 
                  version 4, [2]) attribute, named the "QOS_NLRI" attribute, which aims 
                  at providing QoS (Quality of Service)-related information associated 
                  to the NLRI information conveyed in a BGP UPDATE message. 
                   
               1. Introduction 
                   
                  Providing end-to-end quality of service is probably one of the most 
                  important challenges of the Internet, not only because of the massive 
                  development of value-added IP service offerings, but also because of 
                  the various QoS policies that are currently deployed and enforced 
                  within an autonomous system, and which may well differ from one AS 
                  (Autonomous System) to another. 
                   
                  For almost the last decade, value-added IP service offerings have 
                  been deployed over the Internet, thus yielding a dramatic development 
                  of the specification effort, as far as quality of service in IP

               Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute             Nov. 2000 
                                                    
                                                    
                  networks is concerned. Nevertheless, providing end-to-end quality of 
                  service by crossing administrative domains still remains an issue, 
                  mainly because: 
                   
                  - QoS policies may dramatically differ from one service provider to 
                    another, 
                  - The enforcement of a specific QoS policy may also differ from one 
                    domain to another, although the definition of a set of basic and 
                    common quality of service indicators may be shared between the 
                    service providers. 
                   
                  Activate the BGP4 protocol for exchanging reachability information 
                  between autonomous systems has been a must for many years, and, from 
                  this standpoint, the BGP4 protocol is one of the key components for 
                  the enforcement of end-to-end QoS policies. 
                   
                  Therefore, exchanging QoS-related information as well as reachability 
                  information in a given BGP UPDATE message appears to be helpful in 
                  enforcing an end-to-end QoS policy. 
                   
                  This draft aims at specifying a new BGP4 attribute, the QOS_NLRI 
                  attribute, that will convey QoS-related information associated to 
                  the routes described in the corresponding NLRI (Network Layer 
                  Reachability Information) field of a BGP UPDATE message. 
                   
                  This document is organized into the following sections: 
                   
                  - Section 3 identifies the changes that have been made in the 
                    document since the last version, 
                  - Section 4 describes the attribute and its mode of operation, 
                  - Section 5 elaborates on the use of the capabilities advertisement 
                    feature of the BGP4 protocol, 
                  - Finally, sections 6 and 7 introduce IANA and some security 
                    considerations, respectively.

               4. The QOS_NLRI attribute (Type Code XY*) 
                                               
                  (*): "XY" is subject to the IANA considerations section of this 
                  draft. 
                   
                  This is an optional transitive attribute that can be used for the 
                  following purposes: 
                   
                  (a) To advertise a QoS route to a peer. A QoS route is a route that 
                      meets one or a set of QoS requirement(s) to reach a given (set 
                      of) destination prefixes (see [4], for example). Such QoS 
                      requirements can be expressed in terms of minimum transit delay 
                      to reach a destination, maximum available bandwidth along the 
                      path to reach a destination, and/or the identification of the 
                      traffic that is expected to use this specific route 
                      (identification means for such traffic include DSCP (DiffServ 
                      Code Point, [5]) marking). These QoS requirements can be used as 
                      an input for the route calculation process embedded in the BGP 
                      peers, e.g. thanks to the activation of a signaling protocol, 
                      such as RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol, [6]), 
                   
                  (b) To provide QoS information along with the NLRI information in a 
                      single BGP UPDATE message. It is assumed that this QoS 
                      information will be related to the route (or set of routes) 
                      described in the NLRI field of the BGP UPDATE message. 
                   
                  This draft makes no specific assumption about the means to actually 
                  value this attribute, since this is mostly a matter of 
                  implementation, but the reader is kindly suggested to have a look on 
                  the [7], as an example of a means to feed the BGP peer with the 
                  appropriate information. 
                   
                  The QOS_NLRI attribute is encoded as follows:

                  The use and meaning of the fields of the QOS_NLRI attribute are 
                  defined as follows: 
                   
                  - QoS Information Code: 
                   
                   This field carries the type of the QOS information. The following 
                    types have been identified so far: 
                   
                  (0) Reserved 
                  (1) Bandwidth 
                  (2) Delay 
                  (3) Jitter 
                  (4) DSCP 
                   
                  - QoS Information Sub-code: 
                   
                   This field carries the sub-type of the QOS information. The 
                    following sub-types have been identified so far: 
                   
                  (0) None (i.e. no sub-type, or sub-type unavailable, or unknown sub-
                      type) 
                  (1) Reserved bandwidth 
                  (2) Available bandwidth 
                  (3) Minimum transit delay 
                  (4) Maximum transit delay 
                  (5) Average transit delay 
                  (6) AF (Assured Forwarding, [8]) type 
                   
                  The instantiation of this sub-code field MUST be compatible with the 
                  value conveyed in the QoS Information code field, as stated in the 
                  following table (the rows represent the QoS Information Code possible 
                  values, the columns represent the QOS Information Sub-code values 
                  identified so far, while the "X" sign indicates incompatibility).

                   This field indicates the value of the QoS information. The 
                    corresponding units obviously depend on the instantiation of the

                  (a) QoS Information Code field is "0", no unit specified, 
                  (b) QoS Information Code field is "1", unit is bits per second (bps), 
                  (c) QoS Information Code field is "2", unit is milliseconds, 
                  (d) QoS Information Code field is "3", unit is milliseconds, 
                  (e) QoS Information Code field is "4", no unit specified. 
                   
                  - Address Family Identifier (AFI): 
                   
                   This field carries the identity of the Network Layer protocol 
                    associated with the Network Address that follows. Presently defined 
                    values for this field are specified in [9] (see the Address Family 
                    Numbers section of this reference document). 
                   
                  - Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI): 
                   
                    This field provides additional information about the type of the 
                    Network Layer Reachability Information carried in the QOS_NLRI 
                    attribute. 
                   
                  - Network Address of Next Hop: 
                   
                    A variable length field that contains the Network Address of the 
                    next router on the path to the destination prefix. 
                   
                  - Network Layer Reachability Information: 
                   
                   A variable length field that lists NLRI for the feasible routes 
                    that are being advertised in this attribute. The next hop 
                    information carried in the QOS_NLRI path attribute defines the 
                    Network Layer address of the border router that should be used as 
                    the next hop to the destinations listed in the QOS_NLRI attribute 
                    in the UPDATE message.   
                   
                  When advertising a QOS_NLRI attribute to an external peer, a router 
                  may use one of its own interface addresses in the next hop component 
                  of the attribute, given the external peer to which the route is being 
                  advertised shares a common subnet with the next hop address.  This is 
                  known as a "first party" next hop.

               Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute             Nov. 2000 
                                                    
                                                    
                  A BGP speaker can advertise to an external peer an interface of any 
                  internal peer router in the next hop component, provided the external 
                  peer to which the route is being advertised shares a common    subnet 
                  with the next hop address.  This is known as a "third party" next hop 
                  information. 
                   
                  A BGP speaker can advertise any external peer router in the next hop 
                  component, provided that the Network Layer address of this border 
                  router was learned from an external peer, and the external peer to 
                  which the route is being advertised shares a common subnet with the 
                  next hop address. This is a second form of "third party" next hop 
                  information. 
                   
                  Normally the next hop information is chosen such that the shortest 
                  available path will be taken. A BGP speaker must be able to support 
                  disabling advertisement of third party next hop information to handle 
                  imperfectly bridged media or for reasons of policy. 
                   
                  A BGP speaker must never advertise an address of a peer to that peer 
                  as a next hop, for a route that the speaker is originating.  A BGP 
                  speaker must never install a route with itself as the next hop. 
                   
                  When a BGP speaker advertises the route to an internal peer, the 
                  advertising speaker should not modify the next hop information 
                  associated with the route. When a BGP speaker receives the route via 
                  an internal link, it may forward packets to the next hop address if 
                  the address contained in the attribute is on a common subnet with the 
                  local and remote BGP speakers. 
                   
                  A BGP UPDATE message that carries the QOS_NLRI MUST also carry the 
                  ORIGIN and the AS_PATH attributes (both in EBGP and in IBGP 
                  exchanges). Moreover, in IBGP exchanges such a message MUST also 
                  carry the LOCAL_PREF attribute. If such a message is received from an 
                  external peer, the local system shall check whether the leftmost AS 
                  in the AS_PATH attribute is equal to the autonomous system number of 
                  the peer than sent the message. If that is not the case, the local 
                  system shall send the NOTIFICATION message with Error Code UPDATE 
                  Message Error, and the Error Subcode set to Malformed AS_PATH. 
                   
                  An UPDATE message that carries no NLRI, other than the one encoded in 
                  the QOS_NLRI attribute, should not carry the NEXT_HOP attribute. If 
                  such a message contains the NEXT_HOP attribute, the BGP speaker that 
                  receives the message should ignore this attribute. 
                   
                   
               5. Use of Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4 
                   
                  A BGP speaker that uses the QOS_NLRI attribute SHOULD use the 
                  Capabilities Advertisement procedures, as defined in [10], so that it 
                  might be able to determine if it can use such an attribute with a 
                  particular peer.

               Internet Draft        The QOS_NLRI BGP4 attribute             Nov. 2000 
                                                    
                                                    
                  The fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter are defined as 
                  follows: 
                   
                  - The Capability Code field is set to N (127 < N < 256, when 
                    considering the "Private Use" range, as specified in [11]), while 
                    the Capability Length field is set to "1". 
                   
                  - The Capability Value field is a one-octet field, encoded the same 
                    way as the QOS Information Code field of the QOS_NLRI attribute.  
                   
               6. IANA Considerations  
                   
                  Section 5 of this draft documents an optional transitive BGP-4 
                  attribute named "QOS_NLRI" whose type value will be assigned by IANA. 
                                                          
               7. Security Considerations 
                   
                  This additional BGP-4 attribute specification does not change the 
                  underlying security issues inherent in the existing BGP-4 protocol 
                  specification [12].
