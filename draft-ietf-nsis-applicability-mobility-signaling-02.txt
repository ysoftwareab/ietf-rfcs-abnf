Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The mobility of IP-based nodes incurs route changes, usually at the
   edge of the network.  Route changes may also be caused by reasons
   other than mobility, such as routing protocol adaptation in response
   to varying network conditions (load sharing, load balancing, etc), or
   host multi-homing.  Macro mobility also involves the change of the
   mobile node's IP addresses.  Since IP addresses are usually part of
   flow identifiers, the change of IP addresses implies the change of
   flow identifiers.  Local mobility usually does not cause the change
   of the global IP addresses, but affects the routing paths within the
   local access network [3].

   In multi-homed mobile networks, mobile nodes (MNs) can have an access
   to multiple interfaces and obtains multiple addresses (e.g, CoAs and
   HoAs).  It enables the MN to choose most appropriate interface or
   address according to application (or flow) types or network
   conditions in homogeneous/heterogeneous environments.  The
   Multihoming helps alleviate various problems caused by wirless
   bottleneck and mobility events, scarce resources and frequent
   handovers for examples.

   NSIS protocol suit consists of two layers: NSIS Transport Layer
   Protocol (NTLP) and the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  The
   NTLP is an application independent protocol which transports service-
   related information between nodes in a network, and each specific
   service has its own NSLP protocol (e.g., QoS-NSLP, NAT/FW-NSLP,
   etc.).

   The goals of this draft are to present the effects of mobility on the
   NTLP/NSLPs and to provide guides on how such NSIS protocols should
   work in various mobility scenarios including multihoming.  Most of
   all, this draft mainly discusses the operations of the NSIS protocols
   in very basic mobility scenarios (e.g., macro mobility management
   protocols such as Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6), including support for
   multi-homing.  More complex scenarios and issues on interworking with
   various mobility-related protocols, such as Seamoby and local
   mobility management protocols, are left for future work.



2.  Requirements Notation and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   The terminology in this draft is based on [2] and [3].  In addition,



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006                [Page 4]

   the following terms are used.  Note that in this draft, a generic
   route change casued by regular IP routing is referred to as a 'route
   change', and especially, the route change caused by mobility is
   referred to as 'mobility' like [4].

   (1) Downstream

      The direction from a data sender towards the data receiver.

   (2) Upstream

      The direction from a data receiver towards the data sender.

   (3) Crossover Node (CRN)

      A Crossover Node is a node that for a given function is a merging
      point of two or more paths along which states are installed.  The
      CRN may not necessarily be a physical route splitting point.
      There exist different types of logical (but not necessarily
      physical) CRNs depending on the signaling states, flow directions,
      mobility management types, and the routing infrastructure:

         From the perspective of NSIS state (i.e., NSLP and NTLP state),
         the types of CRN can be classified as follows.

            NSLP CRN: a signaling application-aware node in the network
            where the corresponding signaling flows begin to merge or
            split after a route change or mobility.  If multiple
            signalling application sessions refer to the same data flow,
            the NSLP CRN after a route change may be different for each
            NSLP involved

            NTLP CRN: an NTLP-aware network node where multiple NTLP
            state begin to merge or split after a route change or
            mobility.

            NSIS CRN: A node is called an NSIS CRN if it an NSLP or an
            NTLP CRN.

         The types of CRN can be further classified according to their
         location in the network, with respect to the path from data
         sender to data receiver, as follows.

            In the mobility scenarios, there are two different types of
            merging points in the network according to the direction of
            signaling flows followed by data flows as shown in Figure 1
            of Section 4.1, where we assume that the MN is the data
            sender.

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005



               Upstream CRN (UCRN): the node closest to the data sender
               from which the state information in the direction from
               data receiver to data sender begins to diverge after a
               handover.

               Downstream CRN (DCRN): the node closest to the data
               sender from which the state information in the direction
               from the data sender to the data receiver begins to
               converge after a handover.

               In general, the DCRN and the UCRN may be different due to
               the asymmetric characteristics of routing although the
               data receiver is the same.

            In case of the route changes, the path change of signaling
            flows results in forming a chain of two CRNs regardless of
            the direction of signaling flows followed by data flows as
            shown in Figure 14 of Appendix A.  The CRN chain is referred
            to as a divergence-convergence pair:

               Divergent-convergent UCRN pair: a chain of the nodes at
               which the state information towards the data sender
               begins to diverge and to converge after a route changes.

               Divergent-convergent DCRN pair: a chain of the nodes at
               which the state information towards the data receiver
               begins to diverge and to converge after a route changes.

         Routing CRN is the node where the old and new paths (rather
         physically) merge using regular IP routing.  For example, the
         merging points caused by mobility management protocols are a
         kind of Routing CRN.  Depending on the location of nodes, the
         routing CRN may not be equal to the NSLP CRN or NTLP CRN.

   (4) Path Update

      Path Update is the procedure for the re-establishment of NSIS
      state on the new path, the teardown of NSIS state on the old path,
      and the update of NSIS state on the common path due to the
      mobility.  The Path Update procedure is used to address mobility
      for the affected flows.

         Upstream Path Update: Path Update for the upstream signaling
         flow which is initiated by an upstream signaling initiator.  If
         the MN is a data sender, the Path Update is initiated by an NI
         on the common path (e.g., a CN, an HA, or an MAP).




Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


         Downstream Path Update: Path Update for the downstream
         signaling flow which is triggered by a downstream signaling
         initiator.  If the MN is a data sender, the Path Update is
         triggered by an NI on the new path (e.g., an MN, a mobility
         agent, or an AR).

      In case of route changes except for mobility, the update of NSIS
      state on the common path is not required because the flow
      identifiers do not change, which limits the scope of the required
      NSIS signaling .  Especially, in mobility scenarios, if the NSIS
      signaling interacts with local mobility management (LMM) protocols
      (e.g., HMIPv6), the Path Update can be localized within the access
      network.

   (5) Dead Peer Discovery (DPD)

      The procedure for finding a dead NSIS peer due to a link/node
      failure or due to an MN moving away.



3.  Problem Statement

   IP mobility in its simplest form only includes route changes.  This
   section identifies problems caused by mobility, which may have a
   significant impact on the operations of NSIS protocols.

3.1  General problems

   The general problems caused by mobility are as follows.

   (1) Change of route and possibly change of the MN IP address

      Topology changes might lead to path changes for data packets sent
      to or from the MN and may lead to an IP address change of the MN.

   (2) Latency of route changes

      The change of route and IP addresses in mobile environments is
      typically much faster and more frequent than traditional route
      changes caused by node or link failure.

   (3) Explicit routes

      Path-coupled signaling protocols usually expect the data traffic
      to follow the same path as the signaling , but the data traffic
      sometimes traverses a path different from the path of signaling
      traffic due to the adaptation of routing tables to varying network



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      conditions and to techniques such as load balancing, load sharing
      and mobility.  For example, Mobile IP may use the routing headers
      to define explicit routes, which diverts the traffic from an
      expected path.

   (4) IP-in-IP encapsulation

      Mobility protocols may use IP-in-IP encapsulation on the segment
      of the end-to-end path for routing traffic from the CN to the MN,
      and vice versa.  Encapsulation makes any attempt to identify and
      filter data traffic belonging to, for example, a QoS reservation.
      Moreover, encapsulation of data traffic may lead to changes in the
      routing paths since the source and the destination IP addresses of
      the inner  header differ from those of the outer header.  If the
      signaling packets are encapsulated it might be necessary to
      perform a separate signaling exchange for the tunneled region.

   (5) Ping-pong type handover

      Signaling protocols should remove state quickly along the old path
      to limit the waste of resources.  However, in a ping-pong type
      handover, the MN returns to the previous AR after staying with the
      new AR only for a short while, so the prompt removal of state
      along the old path would cause the state to be re-established soon
      again, and therefore it adds overhead.

   (6) Upstream Path Update vs. Downstream Path Update

      Since the upstream and downstream paths are likely not to be the
      same, the upstream and downstream CRNs may not coincide, either.
      Therefore, the Path Update needs to be handled independently for
      the upstream and the downstream, including the discovery of
      upstream and downstream CRNs.

   (7) State identification problem

      A mobility event typically causes the addresses of corresponding
      flow endpoints to change, and thus it is desirable that the
      signaling application state is independent of the underlying flows
      to avoid the state being re-installed completely.  Therefore, the
      identifiers for the session and the flow must not be dependent on
      each other.  This makes it possible to associate the session
      identifier with the signaling application and with different data
      flows.

   (8) Double reservation problem

      Since the state on the old path (and the common path) still



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      remains as it is after re-establishing the state along the new
      path due to mobility (or route changes), the double reservation
      problem occurs.  Although the state on the old path will be
      deleted automatically based on the soft state timeout, the refresh
      timer value may be quite long (e.g., 30s as a default value in
      RSVP).  This problem might result in the waste of resources and
      lead to failure of other reservations (due to lack of resources).
      Note, however, that the degree of impact depends on the frequency
      of path changes and also on the chosen refresh interval.

   (9) End-to-end signaling problem

      The mobility may change the flow identifier, and the change of
      flow identifier requires state update along the entire path to
      reflect the physical location of the MN, resulting in the end-to-
      end signaling.  This also incurs a long state setup delay and
      increased signaling overhead, which affects overall performance of
      signaling protocols.  The long state setup delay may ultimately
      give rise to the service blackout or degradation of multimedia
      services in mobile environments.

   (10) Identification of the crossover node

      When a handover at the edge of network has happened, in the
      typical case, only a part of the end-to-end path used by the data
      packets changes.  In this situation, the CRN plays a central role
      in managing the establishment of the new signaling application
      state, and removing any useless state.

   (11) Key exchange

      When a handover happens, nodes on the new path must be able to
      verify the signaling messages of the MN, and vice versa.  For
      example, if signaling messages are encrypted on a hop-by-hop
      basis, the new access router should be able to continue the
      message encryption and decryption with the incoming MN.

   (12) Authorization Issues

      The Path Update procedure may be initiated by the MN, the CN, or
      even nodes within the network (e.g., MAP in HMIP).  This Path
      Update on behalf of the MN raises authorization issues about the
      entity that is allowed to make these state modifications.

3.2  Mobility-Related Issues with NSIS Protocols

   Considering the issues identified in Section 3.1, this section
   discusses the concerns that arise for the NSIS protocols.

3.2.1  NTLP-Specific Problems

   (1) Interfaces between Mobile IP and NSIS protocols

      To continue to support the existing NSIS state for a session, the
      NTLP protocol should be immediately involved in the CRN discovery
      and Path Update after a mobility event (e.g., handover) happens.
      Therefore, is might be necessary to develop a Mobile IP-specific
      API or reuse/extend existing APIs from Mobile IP (if applicable)
      in NSIS to learn quickly about mobility events at the NTLP and at
      the NSLP layer.  Should a common triggering mechanism between
      routing and NSIS processes be defined to monitor the operations of
      other mobility protocols and trigger a relevant event accordingly?

   (2) Localized Path Update

      The Path Update needs to be localized to improve the performance
      metrics, such as signaling setup delay, resource utilization.Afew
      issues on the interaction between the micro mobility management
      protocols and the NSIS protocol suite arise.  For example, when
      interacting with HMIP, how is the Path Update performed with
      scoped signaling messages within the access network under the
      control of MAP?

3.2.2  QoS-NSLP-Specific Problems

   (1) Invalid NR problem

      If MN is receiver, it might be determined as the last QNE (QNR) on
      the signaling path [5].  If MN, however, moves into a new network
      attachment point, the old AR can not forward QoS-NSLP messages any
      futher to the MN (QNR).  In this case, the old AR's QoS-NSLP may
      trigger an error message to indicate that the last node fails or
      is truncated.  This error message forwarded to QNI may mistakenly
      cause the removal of the state on the existing paths.  It is
      called the 'invalid NR problem' [12].  This situation would not be
      desirable.

   (2) Optimal refresh timer value for mobile environments

      IIn the situation where handover occurs frequently, the
      maintenance of signaling state on the old path for a long time is
      not necessary.  The QoS-NSLP needs to choose appropriate refresh
      intervals depending on the network environments (e.g., access
      network, or core network) or access technologies (e.g., 3G, IEEE
      802.16, WLAN, etc.).

   (3) Athorization-related issues with teardown



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      When tearing down the obsolete state after CRN discovery, can the
      teardown message be sent toward the opposite direction to the
      state initiating node?  This leads to an authorization problem
      because a node which does not initiate signaling for establishing
      the NSLP state may delete the state.  Please note that this
      authorization problem heavily depends on the design of the NSLP.

   (4) Peering agreement issue

      In the inter-domain handover scenarios, how is the peering
      agreement established for aggregate reservation and authorization
      to support individual sessions?

   (5) Dead peer discovery

      A dead peer can occur either because a link or a network node
      failed, or because the MN moved away without informing QoS-NSLP
      (it is recommended to link mobility and NSIS signaling such that
      this does not happen).  How can dead peers be detected in a fast
      and efficient manner?

3.2.3  NAT/FW NSLP-Specific Problems

   The NAT/FW-NSLP establishes and maintains firewall pinholes and NAT
   bindings at NAT/FW-NSLP nodes along the data path [10].  With regard
   to mobility, a few issues need to be considered:

   (1) Update of firewall rules and NAT bindings

      When an IP address changes by mobility, firewall rules and/or NAT
      bindings become invalid because the established flow identifer
      refers to a non-existent flow, which effectively blocks the end
      host's traffic.  For example, without updating the firewall
      pinhole by an NSIS-aware data sender (located behind a firewall),
      data packets with a new source IP address are most likely dropped
      at the firewall. if a data receiver (located behind a NAT) changes
      its IP address, incoming packets are rewritten at the NAT and
      forwarded to the wrong IP address.
      The impact of a out-dated flow identifier is more servere in the
      NAT/FW case than in QoS case.  In the latter case, the impact is
      only that the flow experiences best-effort treatment for a limited
      period of time (until the flow identifier is updated again. [sung-
      hyuck]Here, do we need to add why the impact in the NAT/FW is more
      severe although some detailed description exists above?

   (2) Re-use of NAT/FW-NSLP's old state

      AAlthough NSIS state can be released by applying the soft state



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      Principle after a mobility event, states (such as firewall
      pinholes) can be left in place for some time.  Since the NAT/
      FW-NSLP aims to install pinholes (and NAT bindings), it is still
      possible to re-use this installed state although a mobile node
      roams to a new location.  This means that another host can send
      data through a firewall without any prior NSIS NAT/FW signaling
      because of the previous state which is not yet expired.  This
      might be a problem since an unauthorized end host might be able to
      inject packets through the firewall for a limited period of time.
      Deleting state along the old path might help to limit this
      problem.  However, this problem exists anyway due to the
      capability of IP spoofing as identified in [7], and the main
      problem is the missing data origin authentication (i.e., missing
      cryptographic protection of data traffic).

3.2.4  Common problems related to both NTLP and NSLP

   (1) CRN discovery-related issues

      Which layer should be responsible for the CRN discovery, NTLP
      (GIMPS) or NSLP (QoS-NSLP or NAT/FW-NSLP)?  Although the QoS-NSLP,
      for example, can detect the change of signaling path and discover
      the CRN by keeping track of SII, the CRN discovery at the NTLP
      layer may also be preferred to at the QoS-NSLP.  Concerning CRN
      discovery, the pros and cons of two mechanisms on CRN discovery
      dependent on NSIS layers (i.e., either NTLP or NSLP) need to be
      identified.

   (2) CRN discovery and Path Update on the IP-tunneling path

      Mobile IP uses tunneling mechanisms to forward data packets among
      end hosts.  Traversing over the tunnel, NSIS signaling messages
      are transparent on the tunneling path due to the change of flow's
      addresses.  In case of interworking with IP-tunneling of Mobile
      IP, CRNs can be discovered on the tunneling path.  It enables NSIS
      protocols to perform Path Update procedure over the IP-tunnel.  In
      this case, GIMPS needs to cope with the change of Message Routing
      Information (MRI) for the CRN discovery on the tunnel.  Also, NSLP
      signaling needs to determine when to remove the tunneling segment
      on the signaling path and/or how to tear down he state via
      interworking with the IP-tunneling operation.

   (3) Issues on API between NTLP and NSLP

      In mobile environments, mobility-related information for Path
      Update can be exchanged through the API specified in [2].  Based
      on the information, the involved NSLP can initiate Path Update by
      sending necessary signaling messages through the API.  However,



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      what information should be sent from GIMPS to an NSLP to inform of
      the route changes needs to be discussed further.  The details on
      the API can be an implementation issue.

   (4) Multihoming-related issues

      An NSIS-aware node (e.g., Mobile Node (MN)) may be multihomed.
      NSIS signaling can be used in such multihomed environments.  In
      this case, which NxLP functionality is needed in various
      multihoming scenarios (e.g., bandwidth increase, load balancing,
      bi-casting, resilience, etc.) is an open question.  An overall
      coordination for interworking between the NSIS protocol suite and
      multihoming capability needs to be discussed further.



4.  Basic Operations for Mobility Support

   In this section, the basic protocol interaction of the NSIS protocol
   suite needed after mobility related route changes is discussed.  The
   basic operations include how to discover an appropriate CRN and how
   to perform the Path Update according to the direction of data flows.
   The procedures for CRN discovery (explained in Section 4.2.3) can be
   applied in the same way for both the generic route changes and
   mobility.  However, the Path Update for mobility is different from
   that for the generic route changes as explained in Section 2.

4.1  Route changes caused by mobility

   The route change caused by mobility occurs due to the change of the
   network attachment point of an MN.  It causes divergence (or
   convergence) between the old path where the NSIS state has already
   been installed and the new path where data forwarding will actually
   happen.

   Although mobility may be considered similar to generic route changes,
   the main difference is that the Message Routing Information (MRI:
   e.g., flow identifier) may not change after generic route changes
   while mobility may cause the change of MRI by having a new network
   attachment point.  Since the session should remain the same after any
   mobility event, the MRI should not be used to determine the session
   of any signaling application [4].

   The route change brings on the change of signaling topology different
   from the mobility.  That is, the route change results in forming a
   loop of signaling path that the old path and the new path meet both
   starting point and end point of the route change (i.e., divergence-
   converence pair) (see Appendix).  However, as shown in Figure 1, the

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   mobility generally causes signaling path to either converge or
   diverge depending on the direction of each signaling flow.

      mobility


       Figure 1: The topology for NSIS signaling caused by mobility.

   These topological changes caused by mobility make the NSIS state



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   established on the old path useless and thus it should be removed (in
   the end).  In addition, NSIS state should be established newly along
   the new path and be updated along the common path.

   Re-establishment of NSIS signaling should be localized when route
   changes (including mobility) occur to minimize the impact on the
   service and to scalability.  This localized signaling procedure is
   referred to as PathUpdate (refer to the terminology section).  In
   mobile environments, for example, the NSLP/NTLP needs to limit the
   scope of signaling information only to the affected section of the
   signaling path because the path in the wireless access network
   usually changes only partially.

   One of the most appropriate nodes to perform the Path Update is the
   CRN where the old and new session paths meet.  The CRN should be
   logical merging point, physical merging point.  In the end, CRN
   discovery can be a crucial element to alleviate the double
   reservation and end-to-end signaling problems identified in Section
   3.1.

   The NTLP (of a node experiencing a topological change) should detect
   the route change through the various mechanisms described in [4] at
   the transport level and notify the relevant NSLP(s).  For example,
   the NSLP should initiate NSIS state re-establishment (i.e., QoS re-
   establishment) along the new path and the update or removal of the
   existing state at the signaling application level.

4.2  CRN discovery

4.2.1  Possible approaches for CRN discovery

   The approaches for CRN discovery can be divided into two classes
   depending on which layer is responsible for the CRN discovery
   (addressed in Section 3.2.2), and whether or not the discovery is
   coupled with the transport of signaling application messages.

   From the NSIS protocol stack point of view, the CRN can be discovered
   at either NTLP or NSLP layer.  For the CRN discovery at the NSLP
   layer, the information contained in NSLP signaling messages sent from
   the NSIS initiator (NI) can be used.  For example, the QoS-NSLP of an
   NSIS node can determine whether or not the node is a CRN by comparing
   the Source Identification Information (SII) contained in the incoming
   signaling message to the one stored previously in the node.  That is,
   when a RESERVE message with an existing SESSION ID and different SII
   is received, the QNE knows its upstream peer has changed and realized
   it is implicitly the CRN [5].

   It is also possible to discover the CRN at the NTLP layer since NTLP



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   is responsible for detecting the path change of data (or signaling)
   flow (and the route changes may easily be detected at the NTLP level
   rather than at the NSLP).  The CRN discovery at the NTLP level can be
   considered as a partial process of the peer discovery (e.g. using
   GIMPS query-response message [2]).  In general, the GIMPS messages
   have message routing state information such as flow/session/signaling
   application identifiers, so the signaling application can be
   identified at the NTLP level.  In the connection mode of NTLP, when
   NTLP establishes a messaging association between two adjacent peers,
   two NTLP peers exchange message routing state information through
   GIMPS query and response messages.  In procedure of the messaging
   association, CRN is implicitly discovered by comparing MRI contained
   in the coming signaling to the one stored previously in the node.
   Therefore, although the CRN can be discovered at the NTLP level, the
   discovered CRN could be actually an NSLP-aware node which has an
   involved signaling application.

   The CRN discovery at the NTLP layer is only one part of peer
   discovery procedure, and it does not require any explicit process for
   CRN discovery itself except for GIMPS notification on the information
   ('CRN-is-discovered to NSLP') to NSLP over API.  The NTLP level
   approach results in decreasing complexity of overall NSIS protocol
   processing.  If a route change is directly detected by NSLP, the CRN
   discovery at the NSLP layer is considered as a way to report the
   rerouting.  However, this NSLP-level  approach requires additional
   messages at corresponding NSLPs and thus results in adding complexity
   of overall NSIS protocol processing.

   There can also be two different approaches for the CRN discovery
   depending on whether or not the discovery is coupled with a signaling
   message: coupled approach and uncoupled approach.  In the coupled
   approach, the signaling to install the NSIS state along the new path
   or update the state along the common path is performed simultaneously
   with the CRN discovery.  In the uncoupled approach, the signaling for
   the Path Update is performed after the CRN discovery is completed.
   These two approaches may differ in terms of security.  Generally, the
   coupled approach would be preferred to the uncoupled approach to
   reduce the delay for state update.  Note that the CRN discovery and
   Path Update described in this draft are based on the coupled
   approach.

4.2.2  The identifiers for CRN discovery

   There are some basic identifiers which can be used for the CRN
   discovery at the NTLP level: session identifier (SID), flow
   identifier (MRI), and signaling application identifier (NSLP_ID)
   related to message routing state [2], and NSLP branch identifier
   (NSLP_Br_ID) which identifies an NSIS signaling branch.



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   The SID in GIMPS messages is used to identify the involved session
   because it remains the same while the MRI may change.  The MRI is
   used to specify the relationship between the address information and
   the state (e.g., QoS-NSLP state) re-establishment.  In other words,
   the change of MRI indicates a topological change to the CRN and
   therefore it represents that the state along the common path should
   be updated and the refresh reduction mechanism needs to be used on
   the common path if any.

   The NSLP_ID is used to refer to the corresponding NSLP at the NTLP
   level, and it helps to discover an appropriate NSLP CRN using the
   GIMPS peer discovery message.

   As a virtual branch identifier, the NSLP_Br_ID is a pointer which
   identifies peer nodes in GIMPS messaging association, and it can be
   used to establish or delete messaging associations between NSIS
   peers.  It can also be used as an identifier to determine the CRN at
   the NTLP layer.  The NSLP_Br_ID may include the location information
   of NSIS peer nodes with the corresponding NSLP ID obtained by the
   procedure of GIMPS message association.  For instance, as shown in
   Figures 1 (b) and 2 (a), for the upstream flow case, node A has
   messaging association with node C for NSLP 1 on the old path.  In
   this case, the NSLP_Br_ID for node C at the node A is set to 1-D-#1:
   1, D, and #1 indicate an NSLP_ID-flow, a direction of node
   (Downstream or Upstream), and a value of the branch counter,
   respectively.  After a handover, NSLP 1 of node A requires a
   messaging association for sending its messages towards node D. In
   this case, NSIS entity A creates another NSLP_Br_ID for NSLP 1 toward
   node D and increases the counter of NSLP_Br_ID to locally distinguish
   each virtual interface identifier between adjacent NSLP peers: the
   [NSLP_Br_ID for the node D at the node A is 1-D-#2;.  Note that the
   NSLP_Br_ID can be included in the NSIS message, but it can also be
   considered as an implementation issue.  This identifier would be more
   useful when the physical merging point of the old path and the new
   path is not an NSLP CRN as shown in Figure 1.  Note that GIMPS
   message routing state table [2] including the NSLP_Br_ID can also be
   created as Figure 2.

   Optionally, the Mobility identifier as an object form can also be
   used to inform of the handover of an MN or a route change [12] and
   therefore to expedite the CRN discovery.  The Mobility object is
   defined in the NTLP (e.g., in GIMPS payload) [8] or NSLP messages to
   notify of any mobility event explicitly, and it contains various
   mobility-related fields such as mobility_event _counter (MEC) and
   handover_init (HI) fields.  For example, the mobility_event_counter
   (MEC) field in the mobility object can be used to detect the latest
   handover event to avoid any confusion about where to send the
   confirmation message in cae of Ping-pong type handover.  Therefore,

   the Mobility identifier is useful to discover the most appropriate
   CRN.

4.2.3  The procedures of CRN discovery

   When a mobility event occurs, the CRN can be recognized by comparing
   the previously stored identifiers with the identifiers included in
   the incoming NSIS peer discovery message initiated by an NI (e.g., an
   MN or a CN).  For example, if an NTLP message is routed to an NSIS
   peer node, the following information (shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b))

   should be checked to determine if the current node is CRN:

   -  Whether or not the same NSLP_ID exists

   -  Whether or not the corresponding CRN has already been discovered

   -  Whether or not the same SID and MRI exist

   -  Whether or not the NSLP_Br_ID has been changed: for example, as
      shown in Figure 2 (a), for NSLP 1 it has been changed to 1-D-#2
      from 1-D-#1 at the node A.

   -  Optionally, the Mobility identifier can be examined, if any.  For
      example, the MEC field of the Mobility object can be used to find
      out which message has been sent due to the latest handover.

   The CRN discovery can be further divided into the UCRN discovery and
   DCRN discovery depending on which node is a signaling initiator (by
   upstream or downstream), or whether the MN is the data sender or
   receiver:

   -  If the MN is a data sender and undergoes a handover, the MN begins
      to transmit signaling messages toward a CN in the downstream
      direction.  If an NSLP-aware node recognizes that the session
      paths logically converge at that node, then the node determines
      that it is the DCRN; the procedure for CRN discovery corresponds
      to the creation of the routing table of node N as shown in Figure
      2 (b).

   -  When an MN (as a sender) undergoes handover, the UCRN can be
      discovered for the upstream flow.  The UCRN should be the node
      (closest to the MN) where the signaling flow begins to logically
      diverge: it corresponds to the creation of the routing table of
      node A as shown in Figure 2 (a).  Since the UCRN is determined
      according as depending on whether the outgoing logical interfaces
      diverge or not, the UCRN discovery is more complex than the DCRN
      discovery and needs to be discussed further.

4.3  Path update

   The CRN discovery procedures are different depending on the direction
   of signaling flows in mobility scenarios, and therefore the
   procedures for Path Update also are different according to the
   direction of the signaling flow.  The Path Update can be divided into
   upstream Path Update and downstream Path Update.  For both types of
   Path Update, the NSIS protocol suite may need to interact with
   various mobility signaling protocols, if any (during or after
   handover) to obtain performance gains (e.g., through fast

   establishment of the NSIS state on the new path).  For this purpose,
   NSIS may also need to monitor the movement of the MN through several
   methods [4].  In this section, we assume that an MN is the data
   sender.

4.3.1  State setup and update

   Before initiating the Path Update, the MN or the CN need to have its
   session ownership by the procedures for authentication and
   authorization.  The MN or the CN may also check the availability of
   resources on the new path.  In case of QoS-NSLP, the Query message
   can be used to find the availability of resources in the new access
   network.  If the resources along the new path are not sufficient, it
   may be needed to keep the state established previously using
   multihomed interfaces while blocking incoming new requests (see
   Section 5.2).  In this situation, providing NSIS signaling for the
   Path Update over local requests for the resources will be helpful for
   seamless service.  The admission control for the Path Update should
   prefer to admit an exisiting NSIS state.

   In the downstream Path Update, if resources are available, the MN
   initiates the NSIS signaling for state setup toward a CN along the
   new path and the implicit DCRN discovery is performed by this type of
   signaling as described in Section 4.2.3.  When the DCRN is
   discovered, it sends a response message towards the MN to notify of
   the NSLP state installed (e.g., QoS-NSLP state) or installs the NSLP
   state as a response to the initiated NSLP signaling (e.g., as in
   RSVP).  In case of QoS-NSLP, the sender-initiated approach leads to
   faster setup than the receiver-initiated approach as in RSVP as shown
   in Figure 3.  And afterwared, the DCRN sends a refresh message
   towards the signaling destination to update the MRI on the common
   path and also sends a teardown message towards the old AR to delete
   the NSIS state (if possible).

   In the case of upstream Path Update, the CN (or a HA/ a GFA/MAP)
   sends a refresh message toward the MN to perform Path Update.  UCRN
   is discovered implicitly by the CN-initiated signaling along the
   common path as described in Section 4.2.3 .  In this case, the CN
   should be informed of the mobility event using an NSIS signaling
   message sent by the MN or monitoring the mobility signaling procedure
   (e.g., detecting a change in its binding entry (see Section 5.1)).
   After the UCRN is determined, it may send a refresh message to the MN
   along the new path while establishing the messaging association
   between the newly found peers.  Afterwards, the UCRN may send a
   teardown message towards the old AR to delete the NSIS state (if
   possible).

      (b) Receiver Initiated Reservation

     Figure.3 Sender- vs. Receiver-initiated reservation

   The state update on the common path to reflect the changed MRI brings
   issues on the end-to-end signaling addressed in Section 3.1.
   Although the state update does not give rise to re-processing of AAA
   and admission control, it may lead to the increased signaling
   overhead and latency.

   One of the goals of the Path Update is to avoid the double
   reservation (in QoS signaling) on the common path as described in
   Section 3.1.  The double reservation problem on the common path can
   be solved by establishing a signaling association using a unique SID
   and by updating packet classifier/flow identifier.  In this case, the
   NSLP state should be shared for flows with different flow
   identifiers.

4.3.2  State teardown

   After establishment of the NSIS state along the new path, the state
   on the obsolete path needs to be quickly removed by the Path Update
   mechanism to prevent the waste of resources due to double reservation
   (and resource allocation problem by call blocking) and to reduce the
   cost of using resources in the access network as identified in
   Section 3.1.  Although the release of the existing state on the old
   path can be accomplished by the timeout of soft state, the refresh
   timer value may be quite long to reduce the overhead of signaling
   messages.  Especially, in mobility scenarios, the maintenance of the
   NSIS state on the old path for a long time is not necessary.
   Therefore, the transmission of a teardown message is useful to
   quickly delete the old state.  Note that, however, it is not
   necessary for GIMPS state to be explicitly removed because of the
   inexpensiveness of the state maintenance at the GIMPS layer [2].

   The CRN is an appropriate point to initiate the teardown toward the
   old AR after establishment of the state along the new path.  The
   release of the state on the obsolete path can be accomplished by
   comparing the NSLP_Br_IDs and through reverse routing using SII.
   This can prevent the teardown message from being forwarded toward
   along the common path.

   It may not be desirable to allow the teardown message to be sent
   toward the opposite direction to the state initiating node.  This is
   because it leads to an authorization problem because a node which
   does not initiate signaling for establishing the NSIS state can
   delete the already established state.  One simple way to avoid the
   authorization problem is to disallow the transmission of the teardown
   message in the reverse direction [7].

   The immediate removal of state along the old path may not be always
   appropriate for some mobility situations addressed in Section 3.  For
   instance, in the ping-pong type of fast handover, it increases
   signaling overhead, and thus when to delete the state along the
   obsolete path needs to be discussed further (see Section 5.4).
   Another example is the 'invalid NR' problem.  If the old AR is the
   last node on the signaling path due to handover, its NSLP may trigger
   an error message to indicate that NSLP messages cannot be forwarded
   any further.  This error message can immediately remove the state on
   the old path, which should not be deleted before re-establishing the
   state along the new path (make-before-break handover).  More details
   are given in Section 5.5.

5.1  Support for macro mobility-based scenarios

   This section considers how NSIS protocols should interact with the
   basic macro mobility protocols such as Mobile IPv4 [12] and Mobile
   IPv6 [11].  Basically, the following scenarios need to be considered.

   (1) A flow associated with an MN, either sent or received by the MN,
      desires to continually get signaling services even after a Mobile
      IP handover .  In this case, NSIS needs to be able to signal for
      such flows upon the MN's movement to provide seamless service
      (e.g. seamless QoS).  The signaling procedures will create a new
      NSIS branch in the changed direction of flow by using the CRN
      discovery and Path Update.

   (2) Either the sender or the receiver of a flow can initialize NSIS
      signaling, and a node within the network may also initiate NSIS
      signaling for the given session to handle route changes caused by
      Mobile IP-based routing, or to support seamless handover if
      necessary.

   (3) Data traffic, in either direction between an MN and a CN, can be
      routed directly using a routing header, or indirectly by IP-in-IP
      encapsulation (or a combination of both approaches) on different
      segments of the data path depending on the operation of the
      mobility protocol (e.g., Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6, LMM, reverse
      tunneling, etc.)  In this case, NSIS signaling needs to be
      triggered immediately. initiated via a mobility routing interface
      (e.g., mobility API) between the NSIS protocol and the Mobile IP
      or by the query routing tables.

   (4) Mobile IP protocol uses IP-tunneling mechanism to forward data
      traffics among end hosts.  This IP-tunneling mechanism makes it
      difficult for nodes on the tunneling path to intercept or deal
      with NSIS signaling messages (which require special treatments at
      NSIS-aware nodes) because of change of message routing
      information.  Therefore, to perform end-to-end signaling, NSIS
      needs to interact with such IP-tunneling mechanisms.

   (5) An MN undergoes either intra-domain (within an access network
      domain) handover or inter-domain (from an access network domain to
      another) handover.  In case of the inter-domain handover, topology
      information exchange, authorization and accounting issues may be
      more complicated.  In such various handover scenarios, the
      interaction between NSIS signaling and some local mobility
      management protocols (e.g., HMIP, FMIP, etc..) may give rise to
      significant performance gains (see Section 5.3).

   (6) With Mobile IPv6, an MN can support multiple CoAs simultaneously,



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      if it is connected to multiple access networks simultaneously
      (even if it is connected to one access network).  Although only
      one primary CoA will be used for routing traffic from the CN to
      the MN, this multi-homing feature potentially can be used to
      enhance the NSIS signaling performance (see Section 5.2).

5.1.1  Implications to Mobile IP-related scenarios

   As the NSIS WG concentrates on path-coupled signaling, one imposed
   requirement here is that the NSIS protocols are to be associated with
   route changes to support route optimization between the CN & the MN,
   and the IP-in-IP encapsulation from the HA to the MN.  This
   interaction needs to be notified to all NSLPs (by the API between
   GIMPS and NSLP) for the CRN discovery and the Path Update.
   Therefore, either NTLP or NSLP needs to have an interface with the
   Mobile IP to react to the mobility event .  In other words, an NSIS
   implementation needs to be developed to react  on mobility events
   based on the endpoint notification depending on which behaviour of a
   mobility protocol has taken place (e.g., the timer of Mobile IP
   expires).

   An ideal interface between the NSIS signaling and the Mobile IP
   should make it possible for NSIS signaling to immediately react to
   the mobility event whenever Mobile IP changes its related
   characteristics in any place for the flows.  In general, it is
   appropriate that NTLP is involved in the interaction with Mobile IP
   rather than NSLP because NTLP is responsible for routing NSIS
   messages.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume NTLP should be able
   to notify NSLP for the necessity of state update over API between
   NTLP and NSLP when the mobility events are detected.

   The following issues also arise concerning the API between the NSIS
   protocol and the Mobile IP.

   -  Which information should be used to detect the movement?  After an
      MN moves to a new network attachment point, the new reachability
      information is transferred from the MN to its HA as the last
      procedure of handover.  It indicates that the NTLP may need to
      interact with a binding process (e.g., a registration request in
      Mobile IPv4 and Binding Update in Mobile IPv6) to detect the IP
      address change and refer to the tunneling-related information.
      Provided that the NTLP detects the mobility using the information
      regarding binding process, faster state establishment and removal
      can be performed.  However, in the fast or ping-pong type
      handover, it may result in significant signaling overhead and some
      possible errors (see Section 5.4).

   -  How and what information can the NSLP expect from NTLP, or



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      directly from the routing interface after a mobility event
      happens?

   -  How is the mobility binding update interval coordinated with the
      NSIS signaling interval?  Since the binding update or the
      registration request occurs periodically even for the MN with the
      same point of attachment, the movement detection based on the
      binding process may cause the NTLP/NSLP to initiate the CRN
      discovery and the Path Update inappropriately.  To avoid the
      problem, the change of CoA should be checked carefully.  Although
      this issue is closely related to implementation, it should be
      considered to obtain any performance gains in signaling.

   An overall coordination/synchronization for the interworking between
   the NSIS and the Mobile IP needs to be discussed further.

5.1.1.1  Mobile IPv4-specific issues

   With Mobile IPv4, the data flows are forwarded based on the
   triangular routing, and an MN retains a new CoA from the FA (or an
   external method such as DHCP) in the visited access network [5].
   When the MN acts as a sender, the downstream data flows sent from the
   MN are directly transferred to the CN not necessarily through the HA
   or indirectly through the HA using the reverse routing.  On the other
   hand, upstream data flows sent from the CN are routed through the IP
   tunneling between the HA and the FA (or the HA and the MN in case of
   the Co-located CoA).  With this approach, routing is dependent on the
   HA, and therefore the NSIS protocols needs to interact with the IP
   tunneling procedure of Mobile IP for signaling.

   Note that in QoS-NSLP, if Mobile IPv4 protocol uses triangular
   routing mechanism, the receiver-initated approach is not suited to
   establish the QoS states over the Mobile IPv4 because the path of
   Query messages directly sent from an MN to a CN is not identical with
   that of RESPONSE messages forwarded via HA from the CN to the MN.
   Therefore, in this case, the Mobile IP should use the reverse
   tunneling mechanism and the Query messages need to be forwarded over
   reverse tunneling from FA to HA.  On the other hand, since in the
   sender-initiated approach, RESERVE messgees travel in the same
   direction as data flow without any QUERY message to establish the
   desired QoS states, this approach can be used for both triangular
   routing and reverse tunneling mechanisms.

   The Figures 5 (a) to (e) show the NSIS signaling flows depending on
   the direction of data flows and the routing methods.

   -  For the downstream signaling flow, the MN needs to perform the CRN
      discovery (DCRN) and the (downstream) Path Update toward the CN
      (as described in Section 4) to establish the NSIS state along the
      new path between the MN and the CN as shown in Figure 4 (a).  If
      the reverse tunnel is used and the state along the tunneling path
      does not exist, the NSIS state should be established along the
      tunneling path from the FA to the HA as shown in Figure 4 (b).  In
      this case, a DCRN may be discovered on the tunneling path and the
      new flow identifier for the state update on the tunnel may need to
      be created.  That is, signaling flows over the tunnel are
      considered as separated flows and thus the tunnel endpoints can
      initiate a new signaling session for the flow over the tunnel.

   -  For the upstream signaling flow, the CN may initiate the NSIS
      signaling to update the existing state between the CN and the HA,
      and in this case NSIS signaling should interact with the IP
      tunneling operation to update the state along the tunneling
      segment from the HA to the FA as shown in Figure 4 (d).  During
      this operation, a UCRN may be discovered on the tunneling path,
      and the new flow identifier for the state update on the tunnel may
      need to be created.

   When the MN (as a sender) arrives at a new foreign link (FL) and the
   corresponding binding process for the co-located CoA is completed,

   -  For the downstream signaling flow, the NSIS signaling for the DCRN
      discovery and the Path Update is the same as the case for FA CoA
      above except for the use of the reverse tunnel path from the MN to
      the HA as shown in Figure 4 (C).  That is, in this case, one of
      tunnel end points is to be the MN, not the FA.

   -  For the upstream signaling flow, the NSIS signaling for the UCRN
      discovery and the Path Update is also the same as the case for FA
      CoA above except for the end point of tunneling path from the HA
      to the MN as shown in Figure 4 (e).

   Note that the DCRN and UCRN may be identified at the same node on the
   tunneling path.  For example, NSIS CRN may be usually the HA if the
   HA and the FA are NSIS-aware but the NSIS signlaing over the
   tunneling path is not coped with.  Therefore, the CRN discovery will
   be affected depending on the type of interaction between NSIS
   signaling and IP tunneling.  The FA and the HA should be NSIS-aware
   to do the Path Update along the appropriate path.  The effect that
   the IP tunneling has on the CRN discovery and the Path Update should
   be discussed further.

5.1.1.2  Mobile IPv6-specific issues

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   Unlike Mobile IPv4, with Mobile IPv6, the FA is not required in the
   data path and the route optimization process between the MN and CN
   can be used to avoid the triangular routing in the Mobile IPv4
   scenario as shown in Figure 5 [9].  If the use of route optimization
   is not mandatory, data flow routing and NSIS signaling procedures
   (including the CRN discovery and the Path Update) will be similar to
   the case of using the Mobile IPv4 with co-located CoA described in
   Section 5.1.1.1.

   In Mobile IPv6-based scenarios, the non-existence of FA depicts the
   endpoint of IP-tunneling is extended to the MN.  If the MN is sender
   and route optimization is optional, it should initiate both tunnel
   signaling session and end-to-end signaling session by using reverse
   tunneling, and HA as another tunnel endpoint needs to react on the
   tunnel signaling messages and forward the end-to-end NSIS signaling
   messages to the CN.  However, if the route optimization in Mobile
   IPv6 is used as mandatory, NSIS signaling is not necessary to
   interact with IP-tunneling any more.  It also means that NSIS
   signaling should not be initiated simultaneously with Binding Update
   messages.

   When an MN (as a sender) arrives at a new AR and the binding process
   is successfully completed,

   -  For the downstream signaling flow, the MN initiates NSIS signaling
      for the DCRN discovery and the (downstream) Path Update to
      establish the state along the new optimized path between the MN
      and the CN as shown in Figrue 5 (a).  The MN initiates tunnel NSIS
      signaling for DCRN discovery and te path Update over the tunneling
      path from the MN to the HA if the reverse tunnel is used, as shown
      in Figures 5 (b).  In this case, CRN discovery over tunnel can be
      performed as the same approach described in Section 4.2.

   -  For the upstream signaling flow, the CN may also update the state
      along the common path toward the HA through the Path Update, and
      afterward the NSIS state along the tunneling segment from the HA
      to the MN may be updated via the interaction with IP tunneling
      operation as shown in Figure 5 (d).  In this case, the HA needs to
      create a new NSIS tunnel signaling toward the MN as the tunnel
      endpoint.  The obsolete path of the existing tunneling segments
      needs to be removed when re-establishment of NSIS state along the
      new tunneling path.  When to remove the tunneling segment and/or
      how to tear it down through the interworking with the IP-tunneling
      operation is still an open issue.However, if the route
      optimization is used between the CN and the MN, for the upstream
      flow, CN needs to newly initiate end-to-end NSIS signaling to
      discover an appropriate UCRN and do the Path Update along a new
      path between the CN and the MN as shown in Figure 5 (c): the

5.2  NSIS operations in multihomed mobile environments

5.2.1  Overview

   Multihoming refers to a situation where an end node has several
   parallel communication paths to use.  An end node (e.g., an MN in
   mobile environments) may have multiple homogeneous/heterogeneous
   interfaces.  Multiple interfaces can be used in order to increase
   bandwidth availability or to select the most appropriate interface
   according to the type of flow or choices of the user [17].



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   Basically, each network interface has different performance,
   bandwidth, access range, and reliability.  Users may want to select
   the most appropriate set of network interface(s) depending on the
   network environment, particularly in wireless networks which are less
   reliable than wired networks.  Users may also want to select the most
   appropriate interface based on certain criteria or to combine a set
   of interfaces to get sufficient bandwidth [17].

   In multihomed environments, multiple addresses can be allocated to
   either a single interface or multiple interfaces to provide
   ubiquitous and fault-tolerant access to the Internet.  Other benefits
   of having multiple interfaces include load balancing, bi-casting,
   load sharing, and etc.

5.2.2  Examples of NTLP/NSLP operations

   NSIS signaling can be used in various multihoming scenarios described
   above.  This section briefly describes NSIS operations and
   applicability in multihomed Mobile IP-based environments.

   The NTLP uses an endpoint address (e.g., CoA of the MN) to install
   message routing state.  As stated above, there can be multiple CoAs
   for the multihomed MN, and therefore an appropriate CoA (active)
   should be selected to establish the NSIS state between the MN and the
   CN.  Each network interface may be associated with a CoA.  To find a
   feasible CoA for the signaling path, multiple NSIS messages (e.g.,
   multiple QUERY messages of the QoS-NSLP) can be sent from the MN to
   the HA or CN (in case of route optimization), and the HA or CN may
   decide which one to choose based on some criteria (e.g., resource
   availability, delay, etc.).  According to the decision, the HA or CN
   should send a signaling message (e.g., RESERVE) to the MN with the
   selected CoA for further action.

   In the situation where the newly introduced CoA causes the change of
   message routing state, both new and old addresses may be valid for a
   certain amount of time, and the new data path may co-exist with the
   old one.  It is theoretically possible to perform an NSIS state re-
   establishment on the new path during this time interval.  In this
   case, however, the signaling endpoints need to be careful, so that
   the correct routing information will be delivered for setting up a
   new message routing state or updating the existing message routing
   state on the correct path segment.  In addition, performing such
   actions should not cause any NSLP service interruption, protocol
   misbehaviors, or security holes.

   When there is a need for inter-domain handover, an additional delay
   may be caused to perform authentication and authorization compared to
   the intra-domain handover, but the latency penalty of NSIS signaling



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   can be mitigated if the MN is multihomed.

   For load balancing purposes, NSIS can install the NSIS state along
   the multiple paths.  In this case, multiple NSIS messages (e.g.,
   multiple QUERY messages in case of QoS-NSLP) can be sent to the
   remote endpoint to establish NSIS state.  As a result, multiple paths
   can be set up for load balancing between the same endpoints.

   When the MN has multiple CoAs, those CoAs may be sent to the HA
   together with the binding update message for immediate state re-
   establishment.  When to send the CoAs during the binding update
   procedure should be optimized for reducing state setup delay.

   IPv6 has no clearly defined mechanism for detecting the availability
   or loss of media except through the ability or inability to receive
   router advertisements within a stipulated period [18].  An efficient
   way to detect media loss should be provided so that the redirection
   between interfaces can be performed quickly to support seamless
   services.  The result of media detection can be used to trigger
   necessary NSIS operations.

   A more detailed analysis of the NTLP/NSLP operations in various
   multihoming scenarios will be presented in the later version of this
   draft or in a separate draft.

5.3  QoS performance considerations in mobility scenarios

   The routing characteristics of Mobile IP described in Section 5.1
   cause the session path to frequently be changed and thus the NSIS
   signaling in such dynamic environments may cause the various problems
   mentioned in Section 3.1.  In QoS-NSLP, critical issues which make
   QoS performance being degraded should be resolved to guarantee
   services for that data flow.  In this section, particularly, QoS
   performance in terms of resource utilization and signaling latency is
   discussed to give some guidelines on how NSIS protocols should
   interact with mobility management protocols.

   As an example of resource utilization, the double reservation problem
   can be alleviated by usage of a unique session identifier and the
   Path Update procedure including CRN discovery.  However, management
   of the resource utilization in overall NSIS signaling processing
   point of view should be taken into account; in this regard, the
   adjustment of refresh interval is one of crucial elements which
   decide performance metrics of resource utilization as mentioned in
   Section 3.2.  This issue needs to be discussed further in the case of
   the soft state approach to release the obsolete state in mobility
   scenarios is preferred to any explicit tear-down approach.




Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   The NSIS protocol suite normally uses a soft-state approach based on
   the peer-to-peer refresh to manage state in NEs.  The peer-to-peer
   based refresh allows the NSIS to appropriately select the refresh
   interval by considering the current network environment.  For
   example, the refresh timer value in networks with scarce resources
   (e.g., mobile/wireless (access) networks ) may set for a long time to
   decrease the overhead of signaling messages.  If any explicit
   teardown messages for state removal are not used, in the situation
   where handover happens very frequently, the dynamic adjustment of the
   refresh interval can reduce the waste of resources.  In this case,
   the refresh timer value needs to be set to a smaller value in the
   mobile/wireless networks than that in the core (wired) network as in
   [5].  To create dynamic refresh intervals, a general mechanism to be
   able to choose an optimal refresh timer value according to various
   mobile environments needs to be considered.  However, this approach
   requires refresh interval traits dependent on specific network
   environments.  When an MN, for example, roams from WLAN to UMTS or
   WIMAX (or WiBro) networks, the refresh interval in the UMTS or
   WIMAX(or WiBro) networks need to be set up differently from the WLAN
   networks.  This advanced approach to automatically decide refresh
   intervals is further study.

   Note that unlike the QoS-NSLP, the refresh timer of NTLP state does
   not need to be adjusted in the network since signaling application as
   resource reservation is not involve directly.  Furthermore, the NTLP
   state along the obsolete path does not need to be explicitly removed
   before the expiration of refresh timer.

   In mobile wireless networks, QoS-NSLP (rather than the NTLP) is able
   to set the refresh timer value depending on the handover type (e.g.,
   make-before-break or break-before-make) or the reservation style
   (e.g., pre-establishment or re-establishment) to optimize the
   resources utilization.  For example, in the make-before-break
   handover, an appropriate refresh time interval can be notified using
   the reserved field of REFRESH object.  If the refresh timer value is
   set to a little higher value than the estimated handover latency, the
   MN can be provided with seamless QoS service using the pre-reserved
   resources without the waste of resources [6].

   After the state setup on the new path, QNEs on the signaling path may
   send a refresh message to the neighboring peer node before the
   refresh timer expires to update only the state previously installed
   along the path, or update the changed MRI along the common path .  In
   this case,   the overhead required to perform refresh can be reduced,
   in a way similar to the refresh reduction in RSVP [16].  Once a
   RESPONSE message which indicates the successful installation of a
   reservation has been received, subsequent RESERVE messages for
   refresh can simply refer to the existing reservation, rather than



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   including the complete reservation specification.  For example, in
   case of QoS-NSLP, only the SID and the SII with no QSPEC are sent to
   just refresh the state (e.g., reservation) previously installed.  The
   changed flow ID together with those IDs is only sent to update it
   along the common path.  Especially, transmission of the reduced
   number of refresh messages over wireless channels, access networks,
   or core networks results in the efficient utilization of resources.

   As mentioned in Section 3.1, unlike the generic route changes, in
   mobility scenarios, the end-to-end signaling problem by the Path
   Update gives rise to the degradation of network performance such as
   increased signaling overhead, service blackout, and so on.  To reduce
   signaling latency in the Mobile IP-based scenarios, the NSIS protocol
   suite needs to interwork with localized mobility management (LMM).
   If the GIMPS/NSLP( QoS-NSLP or NAT/FW-NSLP) protocols interacts with
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 and the CRN is discovered between an MN and
   MAP, the Path Update can be localized by address mapping.  However,
   how the Path Update is performed with scoped signaling messages
   within the access network under the MAP is for further study.

   In the inter-domain handover, a possible way to mitigate the latency
   penalty is to use the multi-homed MN.  It is also possible to allow
   the NSIS protocols to interact with mobility protocols such as
   Seamoby protocols (e.g., CARD [RFC4066] and CXTP [RFC4067]) and FMIP.
   Another scenario is to use peering agreement which allows aggregation
   authorization to be performed for aggregate reservation on an inter-
   domain link without authorizing each individual session.  How these
   approaches can be used in NSIS signaling is for further study.

5.4  Support for Ping-Pong type handover

   NSIS signaling needs to consider the interaction with ping-pong type
   handover as addressed in Section 3.1 because it has a significant
   effect on when to initiate signaling for state setup or for state
   release.  With the sender-initiated approach, if an MN (as a sender)
   undergoes a handover into a new AR, the NTLP interacts with the
   binding process of Mobile IP to initiate state setup.  However, if
   the MN moves to other ARs or the previous AR again in a short while,
   signaling using the interaction with the binding process may result
   in considerable signaling overhead and some possible errors.
   Immediate teardown of state on the old path may also bring on the
   similar result.  Some identifiers defined in [5] [6] may be useful
   for this situation.

   An NE (e.g.  QNE) can determine if it is a merging point (i.e. an
   NSLP CRN) of the old and new paths, and then it can perform an
   involved state setup on the new path and state teardown on the old
   path .  However, if the QNE receives an NSIS message (e.g., RESERVE)



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 33]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


   with a special flag (e.g.  NO_REPLACE flag) set but with the
   different SII, state teardown on the old path should not happen.
   This may apply to a ping-pong type handover where the MN wishes to
   keep state to its old attachment point in case it moves back there.
   For interaction with the ping-pong type handover, NSIS should
   determine when to set the NO_REPLACE flag depending on when and where
   the MN handovers.  It requires NSIS to monitor or react on the
   mobility events over possible API.  It is stil an open issue and
   needs to be discussed further.

   The Reservation Sequence Number (RSN) may be useful in detecting
   duplicate messages in the mobile environment.  For example, it is
   possible for the MN to move to the second NAR soon after being
   attached to the 1st NAR.  The CRN may receive the RESERVE messages
   (with different RSN) twice when the RESERVE message from the 1st NAR
   arrives later than the RESERVE message from the 2nd NAR.  In this
   case, the CRN should determine which RESERVE message is the latest
   one via the RSN.

   The Mobility object described in Section 4.2.2 can be defined in the
   NTLP (e.g., in GIMPS payload) or NSLP messages to notify of any
   mobility event explicitly, and it may contain various mobility-
   related fields, e.g., mobility_event_counter (MEC).  The MEC field
   can inform the CRN of which incoming massage is the latest and so it
   is useful to detect the latest handover event for avoiding any
   confusion about where to send a confirmation message and to handle
   the ping-pong type of movement.

5.5  Peer failure scenarios

   A dead peer can occur either because a link or a network node failed,
   or because the MN moved away without informing NSLP/NTLP (it is
   recommended to link mobility- and NSIS signaling such that this does
   not happen).

   Dead peers of interest in mobility scenarios include CRN, MN, AR (or
   FA), and HA.  In general, it is possible that only NSIS functions
   (i.e., NTLP/NSLP) of the node may fail, or the that the node itself
   fails completely.  In this regard, the following issues arise.

   -  An MN may either fail or move (or just operate normally).  When it
      fails, it becomes a dead peer.  If it moves and changes its IP
      address without notifying NSLP/NTLP, it also becomes a dead peer.
      The failure or movement of an MN may cause the 'invalid NR'
      problem [8] where the NR is the MN mentioned in Section 3.2.  If
      the MN moves, care should be taken to prevent the teardown of NSIS
      state on the old path before the NSIS state is re-established on
      the new path .  In this case, an error message (or refresh



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 34]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      timeout) should not be generated (or happen) to avoid any teardown
      on the old path and common path.  The problem can be solved by
      using hanover_init (HI) field of the Mobility object described in
      Section 5.4.  The HI field can explicitly inform AR (or CRN) that
      a handover is now initiated, and thus the AR does not initiate any
      error messages (or refresh timeout) when it does not receive
      responses to refresh messages from the MN [6].  In this case, AR's
      possible approach may be a proxy for the MN (the last node) and it
      may be able to send RESPONSE messages in response to REFRESH (or
      RESERVE) messages from a upstream node.  AR may also forward the
      error message including the HI field toward CN to prevent the NI
      from removing the NSIS state.  However, it is sill an open issue
      whether the hint information such as the HI field through NSIS
      signaling messages needs to be forwarded.

   -  The failure of a (potential) NSIS CRN may result in incomplete
      state re-establishment on the new path and incomplete teardown on
      the old path after handover.  In this case, a new CRN should be
      re-discovered immediately by the CRN discovery procedure described
      in Section 4.2.3.

   -  The failure of an AR may make the interactions with Seamoby
      protocols (such as CARD and CXTP) impossible.  In this case, the
      neighboring peer closest to the dead AR may need to interact with
      such protocols.  A more detailed analysis of interactions with
      Seamoby protocols is left for future work.

   -  In Mobile IP-based scenarios, the failures of NSIS functions at a
      FA and a HA may result in incomplete interaction with IP-
      tunneling.  In this case, recovery for NSIS functions needs to
      immediately be performed.  Also, a more detailed analysis of
      interactions with IP-tunneling is left for future work.

   In any case, dead peers should be discovered fast to minimize service
   interruption.  The procedures for dead peer discovery (DPD) should be
   the same no matter why a peer is dead, because an NE discovering a
   dead peer cannot judge the specific reason.  The procedures for DPD
   should be handled by the NTLP.  In fact, the DPD can be considered as
   an extension to the GIMPS peer discovery.  A peer discovery message
   can be periodically transmitted to the neighboring peer (e.g.,
   responding node in [2]), and the responding node can send a response
   message.  To determine if the peer is alive, the use of a timer may
   be helpful.  For example, the response message may need to be
   received by the sender (e.g., querying node in [2]) before the timer
   expires.  Otherwise, the responding node can be considered dead.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section describes authorization issues for mobility scenarios in
   NSIS.  It tries to raise additional questions beyond those discussed
   in [7].

   For the discussion of various authorization problems we assume that
   initial authorization is strongly coupled to authorization handling
   in subsequent message interactions.  Making this assumption has some
   implication to the signaling message behavior.  It is certainly
   possible that the entities who request the initial reservation or a
   firewall pinhole and those who subsequently cause modifications are
   not the same entities.

   NSIS NSLPs define a flexible authorization scheme.  As argued in [8]
   it is necessary to consider cases where the sender, the receiver or
   both are authorizing a reservation.  For NAT and Firewall signaling
   it is necessary that, the sender and the receiver, authorize the
   creation of a NAT binding and the creation of a firewall pinhole and
   the reason is described in [8].

   Subsequently, we will consider the case where the mobile node acts as
   a data sender followed by a discussion of the CN as a data sender.

6.1  MN as data sender

   This section refers to Figure 1 where the MN acts as a data sender
   which moves from one point of attachment to another.

   This description starts with an initial signaling exchange triggered
   by the MN.  The user (or another entity associated the initial setup)
   provides the credentials for setup as part of the NSLP authorization
   procedure (e.g., QoS reservation).

6.1.1  MN is authorizing entity

   This scenario considers the initial flow setup executed by the MN
   whereby the MN provides authorization for the initial flow setup.
   The initial setup might be used to create state for subsequent
   authorization actions by the MN.  It is obvious that the
   authorization for the NSLP application (e.g., QoS NSLP) has to be
   provided.  Depending on the underlying authorization model it might
   be either peer-to-peer or end-to-middle.  This authorization decision
   can possibly be treated independently of the authorization issues
   discussed in this section.

   The following questions seem to be interesting:

   -  Should the MN indicate that it is the authorizing entity for
      subsequent actions to all entities along the path?

   -  What information should be used for this purpose?

   -  Who should add this information?  Should the visited network of
      the MN add something to the signaling message during the initial
      flow setup?

   -  How do other entities along the path learn this information?

                Figure 6: MN authorized initial reservation

   Next, the case for a mobile node authorizing the DCRN is considered.
   This communication is illustrated in Figure 7.

   The movement of the mobile node after the initial flow setup requires
   authorization.  Various session ownership authorization issues are
   illustrated in [7].

                       Figure 7: MN authorizes DCRN

   The following questions are of interest:

   -  Why should the DCRN execute something on behalf of the MN? (i.e.,



Lee, et al.             Expires January 19, 2006               [Page 37]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      why should it trust the MN and what information can the DCRN use
      for verification? [the trust is not the other way round: the MN
      trusts the DCRN?])  As an example, the DCRN might delete state
      along the old segment.

   -  Should the DCRN alone be able to start signaling (the DCRN might
      be a dedicated node in some mobility protocols (e.g., MAP)) since
      it is the node which has more information than other nodes based
      on the mobility signaling protocols?

   -  How should other nodes between the MN and the DCRN and the nodes
      between the DCRN and the CN know that the DCRN is now acting on
      behalf of the MN?

   The case of a corresponding node triggering an action is discussed in
   the paragraph below.  Figure 8 shows the exchange graphically.

   In this scenario the CN wants to, for example, tear-down a
   reservation.

   The following questions arise:

   -  Why should the MN trust the trigger?  Why should the intermediate
      nodes trust it?

   -  Is it possible to specify the security properties of the trigger
      message in more detail?  Is this an NSIS signaling message?

   -  The discussions about an indicator which entity to charge for the
      reservation might be relevant (see [8]).

   -  Should the CN restrict the actions of the MN (e.g., delete,
      update, create action of established state information)?  On the

      shared segment it might, for example, be possible to restrict the
      allowed action to a flow identifier update.

6.1.2  CN is authorizing entity

   This scenario is similar to the CN triggering in Section 6.1.1.  Two
   slightly different protocol variations will be considered.
   Authorizing some actions in the reverse data flow direction is more
   difficult as it can easily be seen in Figure 9.

6.1.2.1  CN asks MN to trigger action (on behalf of the CN)

   In Figure 9 the CN authorizes the MN to start signaling after, for
   example, a movement.  After receiving the trigger message (and some
   authorization information) the mobile node starts signaling along the
   new segment and automatically discovers the DCRN.  The message
   travels along the shared segment to the CN and updates the flow
   identifier (if necessary).  The MN might additionally allow the DCRN
   to delete the reservation along the old segment.

   The following questions need to be considered:

   -  How should the "delegation" mechanism work such that intermediate
      nodes believe the MN that it is acting on behalf of the CN?

   -  Is it possible to carry this information with the trigger message
      from the CN and the MN?

6.1.2.2  CN uses installed state to route message backwards

   The CN uses NSIS installed state to route a signaling message
   backwards along the path.  In some rare cases the  DCRN node might be
   known already.  In this case it is possible to  stop the update
   process along the shared segment and to possibly mark installed state
   along the old segment for deletion.  When the MN receives the message
   it again has to install state along the new segment towards the DCRN.
   The mobile node might also trigger the deletion of resources along
   the old segment together with this state creation (pessimistic
   delete).  An optimistic delete operation is certainly more error
   prone.

       Figure 10: CN uses installed state to route message backwards

   Figure 10 raises a few questions:

      The security properties of the trigger message need to be
      evaluated.

      It is not always possible to route signaling message backwards
      from the CN to the MN:

      -  state at the new path might not be established (hence the
         signaling message cannot travel backwards)

      -  the signaling message might not reach the MN via the old
         segment.

      In the multi-homing case where the mobile node can be reached via
      more than one path it is possible to execute this exchange.  The
      same might be true for some local repair cases.

      The messages triggered by the MN (namely create state along the
      new segment and the pessimistic 'delete along the old segment)
      still need to be executed on behalf of the CN.  Compared to the
      first variant there might be some room for optimization since the
      first message was transmitted by the CN.

6.1.2.3  MN and CN are authorized

   If we argue that the authorization at the NSLP layer is somehow tight
   to the authorization for certain protocol actions then we also have
   to consider the case where the MN and the CN have to contribute to
   the authorization decision.  This situation appears, for example, in
   the NAT/Firewall signaling case but also in the area of QoS
   reservation where both parties might need to share the cost of a
   reservation.

   If both end hosts are authorized then some signaling message
   exchanges are less difficult since the trigger message does not need
   to delegate the authorization decision.  Some problems, however, do
   not disappear such as the session ownership problem and additional
   problems might be caused by certain solution approaches.  Since this
   section does not discuss solutions the reader is referred to the [7]
   draft which lists a few proposals for addressing the session
   ownership problem.

6.1.3  CN as data sender

   In this section we consider the scenarios where the CN acts as a data
   sender.  Figure 1 shows the topology and the participating entities.

6.1.3.1  CN is authorizing entity

   This scenario is similar to the one described in Section 6.1.1.  No
   additional problems arise with a scenario where the CN is both data
   sender and also the authorizing entity.  In Figure 8 the CN
   authorizes the UCNR to delete the old segment and to establish a new
   reservation along the new segment.  Furthermore, at the shared
   segment only an update of the flow identifier might be necessary.

                Figure 11: CN as data sender is authorized

   Since the mobile node first detects the route changes.  A trigger to
   the CN allows the CN to quickly react on the route changes.  There
   are three variants:

   -  The MN sends a trigger to the CN and the CN starts signaling as
      shown in Figure 11.

   -  The MN routes the message back along the reverse path using the
      previously established state along the old route.  This mechanism
      only works if the MN is able to send messages along the old path.
      As a generic mechanism this is not suggested.

   -  An intermediate node act on its own.  This might be possible that
      the UCRN is an entity which participates in the mobility signaling

      (e.g., Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)) exchange.  Depending on the
      message exchange it needs to be studied whether the signaling
      message provides sufficient authorization to trigger the NSIS
      exchange.

6.1.3.2  MN is authorizing entity

   In this scenario we consider the case where the CN is the data sender
   but the MN authorizes actions.  The considerations are similar to
   those elaborated in Section 6.1.3 where the MN is the data sender but
   the CN is the authorizing entity.

6.1.4  Multi-homing Scenarios

   Multi-homing scenarios have the property that more than one path
   belongs to a signaling session.  In Figure 12 the MN uses two
   interfaces to route NSIS message towards the CN.  The two individual
   flows are tight together by using the same session identifier and
   then associate it with the two flow identifiers.  The MN needs to
   indicate that both reservations need to be kept alive (and the DCRN
   should not delete a reservation).  At the shared segment only a
   single reservation might be stored (if desired).

   From an authorization point of view the session ownership issues is
   applicable since the DCRN needs to merge the two reservations into a
   single one along the shared segment.

6.1.4.1  MN as data sender

   This section shows the multi-homing scenario with the MN as a data
   sender.

   If the MN is the authorizing entity then the session ownership
   problem needs to be solved.  Without solving this type of
   authorization problem it is possible for an adversary to "join" the
   reservation at the shared segment.  Furthermore, it is an open issue
   whether reservation merging is allowed only for cases where one flow
   identifier is used at different interfaces or even with different
   flow identifiers.

   If the CN is the authorizing entity then, again, some message needs
   to be sent from the CN to the MN to trigger the exchange or to route
   the request backwards along the established path.  The MN is
   reachable via the two paths.

6.1.4.2  CN as data sender

   This section shows the multi-homing scenario with the CN as a data
   sender.  The scenario is simpler (for the CN authorizing case) than
   the one described in Section 6.1 since the signaling message along
   the shared segment travels the previously established path.  It shows
   some similarities with a route change scenario.  At the mobile node
   itself the two paths merge which again leads to a session ownership
   problem.  How should the MN know whether a signaling message with the
   same session identifier hitting a different interface belongs to the
   indicated session authorized by the CN?

   If the MN is the authorizing entity then again communication between
   the end hosts is required as a trigger.  Routing the signaling
   messages in the reverse path might, in some cases, also be possible.

6.1.5  Proxy Scenario

   The proxy scenarios refer to those cases where one of the end hosts
   or even both end hosts are not NSIS aware.  Two security implications
   need to be studied:

   -  First, there is an authorization issue with regard to the NSLP
      application.  For QoS signaling the end host (and the user) has to
      authorize the QoS reservation since the reservation might require
      the user is charged for it.  Since the end host is not NSIS aware
      some other mechanism or protocol needs to be available which
      provides this functionality.  For NAT/Firewall signaling delayed
      authorization assures that both end hosts authorize the packet
      filter creation at their local networks (particularly in case of
      missing trust relationship between intermediate networks).

   -  Second, the authorization issues which relate to the session
      ownership problem also need to be studied.  Since the session
      ownership issues are related to the signaling participating nodes
      and not to the users or the true end points we think that it does
      not lead to complications.  This is, however, only true if we
      assume that authorization at the NSLP and authorization decisions
      for the signaling message handling is decoupled.

6.1.6  Conclusion

   This section tries to point to some authorization aspects for NSIS
   signaling in a mobility environment.  Performance is important in
   mobility environments but a proper security handling accounts for a
   high percentage of the total performance.  It is important to
   consider this aspect in the analysis of mobility proposals.

   From the scenarios we can observe the following issues:

   -  Signaling in the direction of the data path is simpler than in the
      opposite direction.

   -  There are many similarities between the scenarios where the MN
      acts as a data sender and the scenarios the CN acts as a data
      sender, particularly if multi-homing scenarios are included.

   -  Many authorization problems arise after the initial setup of
      resources along the path.  This problem can be stated as: "Is an
      entity allowed to perform the indicated action?"  Only a few

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility              July 2005


      problems are related to the initial signaling message exchange.

   -  If the data sender triggers the signaling message exchange and
      also provides authorization then the complexity can be kept fairly
      low.

   -  NSLP authorization decisions should be treated separately from
      authorization decisions which affect the signaling message
      exchange.

   During the work a few open issues have been selected:

   -  This section does not consider the different message types.

   -  The implication of price determination caused by mobility is
      excluded from this description.

   -  It was tried to keep the description in this section very generic.
      Implications of certain mobility protocols are therefore not
      considered.



7.  Change History

7.1  Changes from -00 version

   The major change made to the initial (-00) version of the draft is to
   re-arrange the issues addressed in the draft in order to clearly
   identify general issues caused by mobility itself and NSIS protocols-
   specific issues.  The generic route changes-related text in Section 4
   was moved into Appendix to make this draft more mobility-specific.

   Specifically, the following changes have been made:

   1. Removed the terminologies, 'uplink' and 'downlink' in Section 2.

   2. Removed the terminology, 'local repair' in Sections 2 and 4.

   3. Re-arranged all problems in Section 3 by merging the 'mobility-
      related issues with NSIS protocols' section and the 'problem
      statement and general considerations' section.

   4. Removed the general considerations section in Section 3.

   5. Modified the problem statement section and moved it into the
      general problem section in Section 3.1.

   6. Added more problems including 'Identification of the crossover
      node', 'Key exchanges', and 'AA-related Issues' to Section 3.1

   7. Added the 'Multihoming-related issues' to Section 3.2.4

   8. Removed the issues on 'how to immediately delete the state on the
      old path' in Section 3.2.

   9. Moved the generic route changes-related text in Section 4.1 into
      Appendix.

   10. Removed the figure describing "NSIS signaling topology for
      downstream signaling flow after the route changes in the middle of
      the network" in Figure 2.

   11. Added 'NSLP_IDs' to each node in Figure 1.

   12. Removed the 'use cases of identifiers' section, and instead,
      added the 'support for ping-pong type handover' section to Section
      5.

   13. Added this change history.

7.2  Changes from -01 version

   Version -02 includes mainly a number of clarifications on the issues
   raised in this draft and more details in some specific areas.
   Specifically, the following changes have been made:

   1. Defined the terminologies, 'route change' and 'mobility' in
      Section 2.

   2. Clarified the terminology, 'Crossover node (CRN)' in Section 2.

   3. Removed the terminology, 'mobility CRN' in Section 2.

   4. The issue, 'Priority of signaling messages' in Section 3.2.2 was
      closed, and thus removed it.

   5. Clarified the issue, 'CRN discovery and Path Update on the IP-
      tunneling path in Section 3.2.4.

   6. Added the pros and cons of two mechanisms on CRN discovery
      dependent on NSIS layers to Section 4.2.1.

   7. Clarified the identifier, NSLP_Br_ID for CRN discovery in Section
      4.2.2.

Contributors

   Many individuals have contributed to this draft.  Since it was not
   possible to list them all in the authors section, this section was
   created to have a sincere respect for other authors, Paulo Mendes,
   Robert Hancock and Roland Bless.  Separating authors into two groups
   was done without treating any one of them better (or worse) than
   others.



Acknowledgement

   The authors would like to thank Byoung-Joon Lee, Charles Q. Shen,
   Cornelia Kappler, Henning Schulzrinne, and Jongho Bang for
   significant contributions in four earlier drafts and the previous
   draft.  The authors would also like to thank Robert Hancock, Andrew
   Mcdonald, John Loughney, Dakako Sanda, Rudiger Geib, Cheng Hong 
   Elena Scialpi, and Pratic Bose for their useful comments and 
   suggestions.



Appendix A.  Generic Route Changes

   The mobility occurs due to the change of the network attachment
   point, but the generic route changes is associated with load sharing,
   load balancing, or a link (or node) failure.  These cause divergence
   (or convergence) between the old path along which state has already
   been installed and the new path along which data forwarding will
   actually happen.

   The route changes brings on the change of signaling topology and it
   results in difference according to the types of route changes (e.g.,
   the route changes or mobility).  The route changes generally forms
   two common paths, an old path, and a new path, where the old path and
   the new path begin to diverge from one common path and afterward to
   converge to another common path for each direction of signaling flows
   (e.g., downstream or upstream flows) as shown in Figure 14.
