     Elliptic Curve Algorithms for Asymmetric Key Package Content Type 
                    draft-turner-akf-algs-update-01.txt 


Abstract 

   This document describes conventions for using Elliptic Curve 
   cryptographic algorithms with SignedData and EnvelopedData to protect 
   the AsymmetricKeyPackage content type.  Specifically, it includes 
   conventions necessary to implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   (ECDH) with EnvelopedData and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature 
   Algorithm (ECDSA) with SignedData.  It updates 
   RFC 5959.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC5959] describes conventions necessary to protect the 
   AsymmetricKeyPackage content type [RFC5958] with Cryptographic 
   Message Syntax (CMS) protecting content types: SignedData [RFC5652], 
   EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], AuthenticatedData 
   [RFC5652], and AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].  This document extends 
   the algorithms used with SignedData and EnvelopedData to include 
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic Curve 
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), respectively.  Familiarity with [RFC5959] and 
   [RFC5753] is assumed. 

   This document does not define any new algorithms instead it refers to 
   previously defined algorithms.  

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119]. 

2. AsymmetricKeyPackage 

   As noted in Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958], CMS can be used to 
   protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage.  The following provides guidance 
   for SignedData [RFC5652] and EnvelopedData [RFC5652] when used with 
   Elliptic Curve algorithms.

2.1. SignedData 

   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MAY support ECDSA  
   [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc]. 

2.2. EnvelopedData 

   When key agreement is used, standard (as opposed to co-factor) ECDH 
   [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc] MAY be supported. 

3. Public Key Sizes 

   The easiest way to implement the SignedData and EnvelopedData is with 
   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480]. If an implementation 
   supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on the P-256 curve. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC5480], [RFC5652], 
   [RFC5753], [RFC5959], and [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc] apply. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   None.  Please remove this section prior to publication as an RFC.
