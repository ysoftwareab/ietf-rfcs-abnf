Internet Draft   Directory Schema Listing File Names        June 2003 
 
 
    
1. Introduction 
    
    
   The fastest route to interoperable directory services is through 
   standard object classes and attribute types. There is a growing 
   number of places where schema for Internet Directory Services and 
   Internet Operations are being defined, with varying degrees of 
   documentation.  This plethora of schema is unavoidable in the light 
   of the needs of different service communities, but makes it difficult 
   for directory service builders to find and make use of an existing 
   schema that will serve their needs and increase interoperability with 
   other systems. A listing service providing a single point of 
   discovery for directory service schema will promote schema reuse, 
   reduce duplication of effort, and thus promote directory service 
   interoperability. Schema listings will be stored in multiple files 
   based on the different types of information associated with a 
   listing: meta data and one or more syntax specifications. 
    
    
1.1 Scope 
     
 
   A file name syntax specification intended for use during the initial 
   release of a directory schema listing service is inside the scope of 
   this document. 
    
 
1.2 Terms and Definitions 
     
 
   Information Object - a descriptive abstraction of some real-world 
   object 
    
   Object Attribute - a descriptive property of an information object; 
   typically, object attributes are defined in terms of semantic and 
   syntactic definitions 
    
   Schema - a collection of definitions for related information objects 
    
   Schema Unit - a related or grouped set of object attributes that form 
   a discrete unit within the context of a schema for a particular 
   protocol; examples include an LDAP object class or a WHOIS++ template 
    
   Schema Pak - a related or grouped set of schema units that 
   collectively specify a schema associated with a particular protocol; 
   an example of a schema pak is the set of LDAP object classes 
   specified in [RFC2256]

   Metadata - characteristics that differentiate one schema unit or 
   schema pak from another; used to catalog listing service content; 
   structured using a profile of [RFC2425]; also contains references to 
   files stored within and outside of a listing repository 
    
   Schema Unit Content - a formal specification of a schema unit using a 
   profile of [RFC2425] 
    
   Schema Unit Listing - the combination of a single schema unit content 
   file intended for use within the context of a particular protocol and 
   a file containing metadata describing the schema unit specified 
   within that schema unit content file 
    
   Schema Pak Listing - a single metadata file containing information 
   describing and referring to a set of related or grouped schema unit 
   content files 
    
   Repository - a database in which listings are stored 
    
   Listing Request - a proposed schema unit listing or schema pak 
   listing formatted using [MIME] constructs that is submitted for 
   consideration as a listing to be published in a repository 
    
   Operator - an organization that administers and maintains a 
   repository 
    
    
   Primary Repository - the repository that masters the schema listings 
   database 
    
   Shadow Repository - a repository that mirrors the primary repository 
    
   Contact Person - the name of the individual who holds the authority 
   to update a listing and who should be contacted if questions or 
   concerns arise related to a listing or listing request 
    
   Listing Authority Contact - the name of the individual who holds 
   authority to replace a contact person; can be either the contact 
   person for a listing or an alternate contact within the organization 
   to which the contact person belongs (this allows one person 
   organizations to list schema) 
    
 
2. Formal File Name Syntax 
    
    
   All file names for listing meta data and listing content MUST comply 
   with the following ABNF [RFC2234] grammar:

      file-name = sequence "." listversion "." type 
    
      sequence = ("0" / "current") / NZDIGIT 0*<DIGIT> 
                  ; initialized to one (1) for first schema listing  
                  ; increments by one (1) for each successive schema 
                  ; listing name 
    
      type = "meta-unit" /     ; these <type> values are defined 
             "ldap" /          ; for the initial release of the 
             "pak-ldap" /      ; schema listing service 
             "whois++" / 
             "pak-whois++" /   ; other <type> values may be defined 
             "rwhois" /        ; according to community needs in 
             "pak-rwhois" /    ; the future 
             "whois" / 
             "pak-whois"       ; this document will be updated or 
                               ; obsoleted when additional <type> 
                               ; values are defined 
    
      listversion = 1*<DIGIT> 
 
      NZDIGIT = <any DIGIT except "0" (0x30)> 
 
      DIGIT = <any ASCII decimal digit (0x30 - 0x39)> 
    
   Other possible values of the type component of a file name MAY be 
   defined in the future to accomodate schema listings specified using 
   [RFC2425] profiles other than those defined for containing LDAP 
   [RFC2251], WHOIS++ [RFC1835], and RWHOIS [RFC1714] schema listing 
   content. 
    
    
3. Intended Use of File Names 
    
    
   Schema writers, implementors, and users of the schema listing service 
   SHOULD make use of the form of file names which includes descriptive 
   alphabetic tokens as the value for the <type> part of a file name. 
    
   Filenames MAY be specified as an OID by prepending the OID value used 
   as a root for the service filename and swapping alphabetic tokens for 
   their numeric equivalent according to the following table: 
    
              Token         Number 
              -----------   ------ 
              current         0 
              meta-unit       0 
              ldap            1

              pak-ldap        2 
              whoispp         3 
              pak-whoispp     4

   For the initial release of the service the behaviors documented in 
   Section 4.0 for file retrieval based on file name will be supported. 
   Schema writers, implementors, and users of the schema listing service 
   SHOULD NOT rely on future support of such file retrieval behavior for 
   the file name examples that are missing alphabetic tokens. 
 
   The behavior of file retrieval based on file names containing 
   alphabetic tokens MUST be preserved permanently by the schema listing 
   repository operators. 
    
    
4. Example File Names 
    
    
   Generally, file names will be of the following form: 
    
      "sequence.listversion.type" 
 
   The 'sequence' part of a file name consists of a serial number 
   generated by the primary listing repository operator and is unique 
   within the context of the schema listing service. 
    
   When referring to a listing, a 'listversion' of "0" always represents 
   the most current version (the highest current listversion number) 
   published in the repository. Alternately, the token "current" may be 
   used to request the most current version of a listing file. 
   Otherwise, the listversion part of a file name represents the version 
   number of a listing within the context of the schema listing service. 
    
   The 'type' part of a file name consists of a token or number 
   representing a file type. This token is unique within the context of 
   the schema listing service and reflects the nature of file content. 
    
   If an OID is used to retrieve a file, the base OID used by the 
   primary listing repository operator MUST be prepended to the numeric 
   representation of the filename. 
    
   Retrieval of files will exhibit the following behavior for the 
   initial release of the service (NOTE: a value of 1 is used as the 
   base OID in these examples, the real base OID will be different):
