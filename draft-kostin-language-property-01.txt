Abstract

     (Standard Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is used hereinafter.)
     This document describes an enhancing of symbolic name way of 
character references in HTML by adding to the character symbolic name an 
optional language property in the following manner "&<character symbolic 
name>[+<character language property>];." This language property shows 
what language a referenced character belongs to.

Introduction

     Dear Sirs,

     It seems likely that method of encoding characters in operating 
systems becomes more and more similar to character entity references 
implemented in HTML by notation &<character symbolic name>; (see ref. 
[1] below) (notation, probably, originated from SGML (for SGML, see ref. 
[3] below)). Especially this process becomes apparent in UTF-8 
sequences. At the days of writing this document the symbolic name is not 
yet become a method of operating systems. Probably, the way for 
implementing this method inside operating systems lies over prior trial 
in HTML. This document describes (1st step on the way) an enhancing the 
symbolic name notation by adding to it an optional language property 
which must show what language an encoded character belongs to.

CHAPTER 1 - NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS


(001.001.001.0001 - Chapter 1, division 1, section 1, paragraph 1)

     A standard Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation is used in this 
document.
<...> - means that enclosed expression is a definition of some element.
[...] - means that enclosed expression is an optional element.
{...} - means that enclosed expression is repeated 0 (zero) or more
        times.
<ABL> - defines left angle bracket i. e. "<".
<ABL> - defines right angle bracket i. e. ">".
<SBL> - defines left square bracket i. e. "[".
<SBR> - defines right square bracket i. e. "]".
<braceL> - defines left brace i. e. "{".
<braceR> - defines right brace i. e. "}".

CHAPTER 2 - LANGUAGE PROPERTY FOR CHARACTER REFERENCES




                          CHAPTER 2, DIVISION 1
                        LANGUAGE PROPERTY SYNTAX


(002.001.001.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 1)

     This document introduces an optional language property for 
characters symbolic names, the names by which characters are encoded in 
HTML (see ref. [1] below). The language property is a short name of a 
language, i. e. abbreviation of a name of some language, which specifies 
what a language the character encoded by a symbolic name belongs to.

(002.001.001.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 2)

     The language property is added after specified symbolic name 
separated from the symbolic name (or from another character property) by 
a language property separator, a plus ("+") sign. (A hyphen, minus ("-") 
sign, is reserved for using inside the language property (abbreviated 
language name), for example to separate subtags as in RFC 3066 (see ref. 
[5] below), also for using inside other possible character properties 
and maybe for using inside the symbolic names too.)

(002.001.001.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 3)

     The language property has a higher priority than the language tag 
described in RFC 3066 (ref. [5] below).

(002.001.001.0004 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 4)

     BNF: &<symbolic name>{<separator><another property>}[+<language 
property>]{<separator><another property>};

     The language property, as you can see and as mentioned above 
(paragraph 1, abstract, introduction), is an optional parameter.

(002.001.001.0005 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 5)

     Exempli gratia:
"&e+lat;&x+lat; &g+lat;&r+lat;&a+lat;&t+lat;&i+lat;&a+lat;" - defines
     Latin expression which, probably, means "for example";
"&p+serb;&a+serb;&r+serb;&k+serb;" - defines Serbo-Croatian word
     which means "a park".

002.001.002 - CHARACTERS USED TO COMPOSE THE LANGUAGE PROPERTY ITSELF


(002.001.002.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 1)

     The language property (abbreviation of a language name) is composed 
of ASCII characters, the characters which form a complete and perhaps a 
most stable and reliable set of characters so far (for ASCII, see ref. 
[4] below), excluding:
1. (excluding) ASCII-characters used as character property separators
    (to avoid confusion with the beginning of another character 
    property) (e. g. a plus ("+") sign is a language property 
    separator),
2. (excluding) the "&" ASCII-character
    (used as delimiter of the beginning of another character reference 
    (ref. [1] below)),
3. (excluding) the ";" ASCII-character
    (used as delimiter of the end of the character reference (ref. [1] 
    below)).

(002.001.002.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 2)

     So list of characters surely allowable for now for composing 
language properties looks as follows:
     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
     a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - _ ' 

(002.001.002.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 2, paragraph 3)

     There is no restriction on a length of a word for representing the 
language property. The word should be as long (or as short) as enough to 
identify, intuitively, by just reading the word, the language, which 
this word represents. (Simple rule for abbreviations.)



                          CHAPTER 2, DIVISION 2
                ABOUT LIST OF SHORT NAMES FOR LANGUAGES


(002.002.001.0001 - Chapter 2, division 2, section 1, paragraph 1)

     For purposes of guarantee unambiguously to identify a language by 
its short name and against possible confusion when different languages 
will named with the same short name and wise versa a list of short words 
(abbreviations) already chosen for names for some languages are 
maintained. This list is permanently opened for free reading, copying, 
distributing, and adding a new language name (the last is rather with 
few restrictions).
