1.  Introduction

   This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with
   inclusive language used in the industry.

   This document updates [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].

2.  Update to RFC2328

   The base OSPFv2 specification [RFC2328] defines the synchronization
   of databases as two routers froming a "master/slave relationship".
   All instances of these terms are replaced by leader/follower,
   respectively.

   The Master (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the
   Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPFv2 is not modified.  The Leader/Follower
   terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition changes impact the
   following sections: 7.2 "The Synchronization of Databases", 10 "The
   Neighbor Data Structures", 10.1 "Neighbor states", 10.2 "Events
   causing neighbor state changes", 10.6 "Receiving Database Description
   Packets", 10.8 "Sending Database Description Packets", 10.10 "An
   Example", and A.3.3 "The Database Description packet".

3.  Update to RFC5340

   The base OSPFv3 specification [RFC5340] defines the database
   description process between two routers as one being "designated to
   be the master and the other is the slave".  All instances of these
   terms are replaced by leader/follower, respectively.

   The Master/Slave (MS) bit in the database description packet is
   renamed the Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPFv3 is not modified.  The Leader/Follower
   terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition changes impact section
   A.3.3 "The Database Description packet".

4.  Other RFCs With References

   The following OSPF RFCs also have references to the legacy
   terminology.

   *  RFC 4222 - Prioritized Treatment of Specific OSPF Version 2
      Packets and Congestion Avoidance (BCP) [RFC4222]

   *  RFC 5243 - OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization
      (Informational) [RFC5243]

   *  RFC 4811 - OSPF Out-of-Band Link State Database (LSDB)
      Resynchronization (Experimental) [RFC4811]

   *  RFC 5243 - OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization
      (Informational) [RFC5243]

   *  RFC 5614 - Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension of OSPF Using
      Connected Dominating Set (CDS) Flooding (Experimental) [RFC5614]

   *  RFC 5838 - Support of Address Families in OSPFv3 (Standards Track)
      [RFC5838]

   Some of these will be updated by this document.  The final set is
   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to rename bit 0x01 in the "Database Description
   (DD) Packet Flags" registry to "Leader (L-bit)" and to add a
   reference to this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document updates the terminology used in OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and
   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] without any modification to the specification of the
   protocol.  As such, the security characteristics of OSPF do not
   change.
