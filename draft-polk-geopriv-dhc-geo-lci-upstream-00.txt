Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3825 to allow explicitly the transmission 
   of DHCP option 123, "Location Configuration Information", from a
   DHCP client to a DHCP server.  Transmission of option 123 from a 
   client to a server allows a client that knows its location through 
   some other means to communicate that location to the DHCP server.

Internet-Draft            DHCP Geo LCI Upstream                May 2005

1.  Introduction

   This document updates RFC 3825, "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   Option for Coordinate-based Location Configuration Information" 
   [RFC3825], to allow explicitly the transmission of DHCP option 123, 
   "Location Configuration Information", from the client to the server.

   This document updates RFC 3825 [RFC3825].


1.1  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Transmitting DHCP Option 123 Upstream

   RFC3825 made communications between the client and server explicit 
   for retrieval of location configuration information (in the 
   coordinate format), but only explicitly discussed location 
   information going from the server to the client.  This option can be
   supplied to the client unrequested, or it can be requested by the 
   client.  See RFC 3825 for those details.  

   In addition to the case in which the DHCP server explicitly provides
   location information to the client, it may be the case that the 
   client has obtained its own location information through some other 
   mechanism such as manual configuration or through a Global 
   Positioning System (GPS).  When the client has its own location 
   information, the client MAY include that information in DHCP option 
   123 [RFC3825] in a DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST message sent to the 
   server, to supply the client's location information to the DHCP 
   server.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of the IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: in the process assigning numbers and building
   IANA registries prior to publication, this section will have served
   its purpose.  It may therefore be removed upon publication as an 
   RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this LCI
   option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used to protect 
   the integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the client and
   destination DHCP server to capture this LCI.

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security
   risks.
