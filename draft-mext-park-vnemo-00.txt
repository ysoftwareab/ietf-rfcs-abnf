1.  Introduction

   Various mobility support mechanism for a mobile terminal have been
   supposed, including outstanding Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].  Also to
   lessen the burden of change in terminal to support mobility, network-
   based mobility solution for a mobile terminal is specified in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].  On the other hands, NEMO basic support
   [RFC3963] support mobility for a router or a subnetwork.  With NEMO,
   a subnet node need not be aware of the movement and no change is
   required to support the mobility, consequently.

   Multiple care-of address registration [MCoA] describes the way how to
   register multiple care-of address to the Home Agent in the case that
   a mobile node has multiple interfaces and uses them to connect
   several access network simultaneously for matters of cost, bandwidth,
   delay, etc.  With multiple care-of addresses, a mobile node (or
   router) can exploit the advantage of each access network.  [MCoA]
   does not have description about the way how to make a choice of
   interface, or access network, to transmit the traffic.

   Virtualization refers to an abstraction technique to share a single
   physical resource among several users.  For a mobile network,
   virtualization can be used to form several virtual mobile networks on
   a single mobile network.  A mobile router with multiple interfaces
   that are connected to multiple access network can support
   differentiation of service quality to its mobile network nodes, by
   adopting virtual mobile network concept.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terms used in this draft are defined in [RFC5213], [RFC3963],
   [RFC3775], [MCoA].  In addition or in replacement of these, the
   following terms are defined or redefined:

   Mobile Network

      A mobile network is a network which is composed of a router and
      its subnet nodes, while the router has mobility.

   Mobile Network Node

      A mobile network node is a node connected to the mobile router.  A
      mobile network node is provided with Internet connectivity from a
      mobile router, so even a mobile network moves, a mobile network
      node that is attached to the mobile router is not aware of the
      movement.  A mobile network node can be mobile itself, or fixed
      with the mobile router.

   Virtual Mobile Network

      A virtual mobile network is a logical network that lies on a
      single physical mobile network.  Several virtual mobile network
      can be exist on a single physical mobile network.  Every virtual
      mobile network includes the mobile router and all or some of the
      mobile network nodes.


3.  Virtualization on a mobile network

   Virtualization is a term refers to a technique for abstraction
   physical resource to provide it to one or more users.  One single
   resource can be seen as several virtual resources to multiple users,
   or several physical resources can be seen as a single virtual
   resource to a user.  For a network, various type of virtualization
   can be exist according to the layer that is virtualized.
   Virtualization at lower layer, PHY or MAC, is implemented using
   various multiplexing or multiple access mechanisms to support
   multiple users that shares a single resource, like a link or radio
   spectrum.  But usually lower layer multiplexing technique needs MAC-
   level or PHY-level modification, and it is hard to implement or
   manage.

   A network can be virtualized at a higher layer.  An overlay network
   is example of the network virtualization at a higher layer, like
   network layer or application layer.  In an overlay network, a virtual
   link which is composed of multi-hop physical link connects two or
   more overlay nodes.  On a single physical network composed of routers
   and terminals, several virtual networks can be exist.

   Under IPv6, a virtual mobile network can be implemented in other way,
   by using several mobile network prefixes in a single NEMO.  In this
   way, a part of mobile network, including mobile router itself and
   some of the mobile network nodes, forms a virtual mobile network
   while the mobile router and other mobile network nodes compose
   another virtual mobile network on the same NEMO.

   Each virtual mobile network is distinguished by mobile network prefix
   that the virtual mobile network uses.  A mobile router sets up
   multiple mobile network prefixes for the virtual mobile networks.  A
   mobile network node selects one of the mobile network prefixes
   advertised by the mobile router.


4.  Differentiation Using Virtual Mobile Network

   Service differentiation for mobile network can be implemented using
   virtual mobile network concept.

4.1.  Single access network case

   A mobile router generates several prefixes to form multiple virtual
   mobile networks.  Each virtual mobile network corrspondes to a
   priority class of each mobile network node.  The decision of virtual
   mobile network for a mobile network node is negotiated when the
   mobile network node attahces to the mobile router.  When a mobile
   network node sends traffic to the Internet, the mobile router
   regulates the traffic according to the priority of the virtual mobile
   network in which the mobile network joined.

4.2.  Multiple access network case

   In the case that the mobile router has several interfaces that are
   connected to multiple access networks, characteristic of each access
   network can be used for service differentiation of virtual mobile
   networks.  A mobile router generates new mobile network prefix when
   it attaches to a new access network.  Each mobile network prefix
   forms a new virtual mobile network, while the mobile network prefix

   also connected to a specific access network.  The mapping information
   between the mobile network prefix and the access network is stored in
   the mobile router.

   When a mobile network node joins to the mobile network, it notifies
   the access network requirement to the mobile router.  The network
   requirement can be traffic classification, like BE, Voice, or Video,
   or the network requirement can be specified by some parameters like
   bandwidth, packet loss rate, or latency.  According to the
   requirement, the mobile network selects an appropriate virtual mobile
   network, e.g. the mobile network prefix, that is connected to one of
   the access networks.  The mobile network node then configures the
   address.  Traffic from the mobile network node destined to the
   Internet is classified at the mobile router and forwarded to the
   access network connected to the virtual mobile network prefix.


5.  Security Considerations

   We do not consider any security issues in this draft.
