2. Abstract

	This document presents an extension to current Ethernet Frame 
	standards to support payloads greater than 1500 Bytes for Ethernet_II
	and 802.3 frames. This is useful for Gigabit Ethernet technology, 
        providing a means to carry large MTU packets without fragmentation 
        over a high-speed broadcast network.

3. Overview

	There are two fundamental frame types defined for Ethernet:
	Ethernet II [ETH] [RFC894] and 802.3 [IEEE802.3]. 802.3 headers
	may be followed by a Logical Link Control header,
	802.2 [IEEE802.2]. Both types of encapsulations can co-exist on
	the same media at the same time. Encodings for Ethernet II and 802.3
	frames evolved such that, as long as payloads were less than 1500
	bytes, Ethernet II frames could always be distinguished from
	IEEE 802.3 frames.

	However, when the payload is greater than 1500 bytes frames may 
        not be uniquely distinguishable as conforming to Ethernet II or 
        802.3 formats. This document extends the Ethernet frame format 
	to allow Ethernet_II or 802.3 frame payloads larger than 1500 bytes 
        to be uniquely distinguished.

4. Ethernet Frame Formats

	A. Ethernet II
		
		+----+----+------+------+-----+
		| DA | SA | Type | Data | FCS |
		+----+----+------+------+-----+
	  
		DA      Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)
		SA      Source MAC Address      (6 bytes)
		Type    Protocol Type           (2 bytes)
		Data    Protocol Data           (46 - 1500 bytes)
		FCS     Frame Checksum          (4 bytes)

	B. IEEE 802.3 and derivatives

		+----+----+------+------+-----+
		| DA | SA | Len  | Data | FCS |
		+----+----+------+------+-----+

		DA      Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)
		SA      Source MAC Address      (6 bytes)
		Len     Length of Data field    (2 bytes)
		Data    Protocol Data           (46 - 1500 bytes)
		FCS     Frame Checksum          (4 bytes)
	  
	The derivatives include LLC (802.2) and SNAP which prefix the
	data field with an LLC header.  In these instances the Len field
	then corresponds to the combined size of both the data portion
	of the frame and the LLC header.
	
	On reception, the two formats are differentiated based on the
	magnitude of the Type/Length field, as follows:

	> 1500 bytes:   value corresponds to a type field.  The frame is an
			Ethernet II frame, with type values starting
			at 1536 (600 hex).

	<= 1500 bytes:  value corresponds to a length field.  The frame is
			an IEEE 802.3 format (or derivative) with a maximum
			data length of 1500 bytes.

5. Problem with Large 802.3 Frames in the presence of Ethernet_II Frames

	Some protocols commonly used in the Internet have no reserved Ethertype.
        An example is the set of ISO Network layer protocols, of which
        ISIS is a member. Such protocols are only defined to use the IEEE 
        802.3/802.2 encoding, and so their packets are limited in length to
        1500 bytes.

 	Ethernet_II frames have no length field. Protocols encapsulated in 
	Ethernet II frames, such as IP, are not limited in length to 1500 
        bytes by framing.

6. Proposed Ethernet Frame Extension

	Large 802.3 and Ethernet_II frames can be supported by the following:
	
	+  Define an Ethertype for 802.3, 0x8870, and encode large frames
	   (where the data field is greater than 1500 bytes),
	   exclusive of the Destination MAC address, Source MAC address,
           and Data length fields, within Ethernet II.

	   Large 802.3/802.2 frames would have the following fields:
 
		+----+----+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
		| DA | SA | Type | DSAP | SSAP | Ctrl | Data | FCS |
		+----+----+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
				  === 802.2 Header ===

		DA      Destination MAC Address                 (6 bytes)
		SA      Source MAC Address                      (6 bytes)
		Type    0x8870 (Ethertype)                      (2 bytes)
		DSAP    802.2 Destination Service Access Point  (1 byte)
		SSAP    802.2 Source Service Access Point       (1 byte)
		Ctrl    802.2 Control Field                     (1 byte)
		Data    Protocol Data                           ( > 46 bytes)
		FCS     Frame Checksum                          (4 bytes)
	  
	+  Allow Ethernet II frames to have payloads greater than 1500 bytes.

	There is no loss of information from 802.3/802.2 frames. Although 
        the 802.3 length field is missing, the frame length is known by 
        virtue of the frame being accepted by the network interface.

	In this manner, all Ethernet II frames, including large 802.3 
 	packets, can be longer than 1500 bytes, yet are uniquely identified.
