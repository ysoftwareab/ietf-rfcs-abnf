<title>Automatic Extended Route Optimization (AERO)</title>
<meta content="Fred L. Templin" name="author">
<meta content="
       This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization
      (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network
      (OMNI) interfaces. AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that
      supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) protocol.
      Prefix delegation/registration services are employed for network
      admission and to manage the IP forwarding and routing systems. Secure
      multilink operation, mobility management, multicast, traffic selector
      signaling and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic
      neighbor cache updates. AERO is a widely-applicable mobile
      internetworking service especially well-suited to aviation services,
      intelligent transportation systems, mobile end user devices and many
      other applications.

  NOTE: Changes at the bottom of this file overrides some earlier settings.

  Once the style has stabilized and has been adopted as an official RFC style,
  this can be consolidated so that style settings occur only in one place, but
  for now the contents of this file consists first of the initial CSS work as
  provided to the RFC Formatter (xml2rfc) work, followed by itemized and
  commented changes found necssary during the development of the v3
  formatters.

      <h2 id="abstract"><a href="#abstract" class="selfRef">Abstract</a></h2>
<p id="section-abstract-1">This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization
      (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network
      (OMNI) interfaces. AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that
      supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) protocol.
      Prefix delegation/registration services are employed for network
      admission and to manage the IP forwarding and routing systems. Secure
      multilink operation, mobility management, multicast, traffic selector
      signaling and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic
      neighbor cache updates. AERO is a widely-applicable mobile
      internetworking service especially well-suited to aviation services,
      intelligent transportation systems, mobile end user devices and many
      other applications.<a href="#section-abstract-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

      </h2>
<p id="section-1-1">Automatic Extended Route Optimization (AERO) fulfills the
      requirements of Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) <span>[<a href="#RFC7333" class="xref">RFC7333</a>]</span> and route optimization <span>[<a href="#RFC5522" class="xref">RFC5522</a>]</span> for
      aeronautical networking and other network mobility use cases including
      intelligent transportation systems and enterprise mobile device users.
      AERO is a secure internetworking and mobility management service that
      employs the Overlay Multilink Network Interface (OMNI) <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA)
      virtual link model. The OMNI link is a virtual overlay configured over
      one or more underlying Internetworks, and nodes on the link can exchange
      original IP packets as single-hop neighbors. The OMNI Adaptation Layer
      (OAL) supports multilink operation for increased reliability and path
      optimization while providing fragmentation and reassembly services to
      support Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) diversity. In terms of
      precedence, this specification may provide first-principle insights into
      a representative mobility service architecture as context for
      understanding the OMNI specification.<a href="#section-1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-2">The AERO service comprises Clients, Proxy/Servers and Relays that are
      seen as OMNI link neighbors as well as Bridges that interconnect diverse
      Internetworks as OMNI link segments through OAL forwarding at a layer
      below IP. Each node's OMNI interface uses an IPv6 link-local address
      format that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND)
      protocol <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>. A node's OMNI interface can be
      configured over multiple underlying interfaces, and therefore appears as
      a single interface with multiple link-layer addresses. Each link-layer
      address is subject to change due to mobility and/or multilink
      fluctuations, and link-layer address changes are signaled by ND
      messaging the same as for any IPv6 link.<a href="#section-1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-3">AERO provides a secure cloud-based service where mobile node Clients
      may use Proxy/Servers acting either as proxys or designated routers
      while fixed nodes may use any Relay on the link for efficient
      communications. Fixed nodes forward original IP packets destined to
      other AERO nodes via the nearest Relay, which forwards them through the
      cloud. Mobile node Clients discover shortest paths to OMNI link
      neighbors through AERO route optimization. Both unicast and multicast
      communications are supported, and Clients may efficiently move between
      locations while maintaining continuous communications with
      correspondents and without changing their IP Address.<a href="#section-1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-4">AERO Bridges peer with Proxy/Servers in a secured private BGP overlay
      routing instance to establish a Segment Routing Topology (SRT) spanning
      tree over the underlying Internetworks of multiple disjoint
      administrative domains as a single unified OMNI link. Each OMNI link
      instance is characterized by the set of Mobility Service Prefixes (MSPs)
      common to all mobile nodes. Relays provide an optimal route from (fixed)
      correspondent nodes on the underlying Internetwork to (mobile or fixed)
      nodes on the OMNI link. To the underlying Internetwork, the Relay is the
      source of a route to the MSP; hence uplink traffic to the mobile node is
      naturally routed to the nearest Relay.<a href="#section-1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-5">AERO can be used with OMNI links that span private-use Internetworks
      and/or public Internetworks such as the global Internet. In the latter
      case, some end systems may be located behind global Internet Network
      Address Translators (NATs). A means for robust traversal of NATs while
      avoiding "triangle routing" and critical infrastructure traffic
      concentration is therefore provided.<a href="#section-1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-6">AERO assumes the use of PIM Sparse Mode in support of multicast
      communication. In support of Source Specific Multicast (SSM) when a
      Mobile Node is the source, AERO route optimization ensures that a
      shortest-path multicast tree is established with provisions for mobility
      and multilink operation. In all other multicast scenarios there are no
      AERO dependencies.<a href="#section-1-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-7">AERO provides a secure aeronautical internetworking service for both
      manned and unmanned aircraft, where the aircraft is treated as a mobile
      node that can connect an Internet of Things (IoT). AERO is also
      applicable to a wide variety of other use cases. For example, it can be
      used to coordinate the links of mobile nodes (e.g., cellphones, tablets,
      laptop computers, etc.) that connect into a home enterprise network via
      public access networks with VPN or non-VPN services enabled according to
      the appropriate security model. AERO can also be used to facilitate
      terrestrial vehicular and urban air mobility (as well as pedestrian
      communication services) for future intelligent transportation systems
      <span>[<a href="#I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking" class="xref">I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking</a>]</span><span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-ipwave-uam-its" class="xref">I-D.templin-ipwave-uam-its</a>]</span>. Other applicable use cases are
      also in scope.<a href="#section-1-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.1-1">AERO Clients can be deployed as fixed infrastructure nodes close to
        end systems, or as Mobile Nodes (MNs) that can change their network
        attachment points dynamically. AERO Clients configure OMNI interfaces
        over underlying interfaces with addresses that may change due to
        mobility. AERO Clients register their Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs)
        with the AERO service, and distribute the MNPs to nodes on EUNs. AERO
        Bridges, Proxy/Servers and Relays are critical infrastructure elements
        in fixed (i.e., non-mobile) INET deployments and hence have permanent
        and unchanging INET addresses. Together, they constitute the AERO
        service which provides an OMNI link virtual overlay for connecting
        AERO Clients.<a href="#section-3.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1-2">AERO Bridges (together with Proxy/Servers) provide the secured
        backbone supporting infrastructure for a Segment Routing Topology
        (SRT) spanning tree for the OMNI link. Bridges forward carrier packets
        both within the same SRT segment and between disjoint SRT segments
        based on an IPv6 encapsulation mid-layer known as the OMNI Adaptation
        Layer (OAL) <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>. The OMNI interface
        and OAL provide a virtual bridging service, since the inner IP TTL/Hop
        Limit is not decremented. Each Bridge also peers with Proxy/Servers
        and other Bridges in a dynamic routing protocol instance to provide a
        Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) service for the list of active
        MNPs (see <a href="#scaling" class="xref">Section 3.2.3</a>). Bridges present the OMNI link as
        a set of one or more Mobility Service Prefixes (MSPs) and configure
        secured tunnels with Proxy/Servers, Relays and other Bridges; they
        further maintain forwarding table entries for each MNP or non-MNP
        prefix in service on the OMNI link.<a href="#section-3.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        MNPs (see <a href="#scaling" class="xref">Section 3.2.3</a>). Hub Proxy/Servers provide prefix
        delegation/registration services and track the mobility/multilink
        profiles of each of their associated Clients, where each delegated
        prefix becomes an MNP taken from an MSP. Proxy/Servers at ANET/INET
        boundaries provide a forwarding service for ANET Clients to
        communicate with peers in external INETs while Proxy/Servers in the
        open INET provide an authentication service for INET Client IPv6 ND
        messages but limited forwarding services. Source Clients securely
        coordinate with target Clients by sending control messages via a
        First-Hop Segment (FHS) Proxy/Server which forwards them over the SRT
        spanning tree to a Last-Hop Segment (LHS) Proxy/Server which finally
        forwards them to the target.<a href="#section-3.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1-4">AERO Relays are Proxy/Servers that provide forwarding services to
        exchange original IP packets between the OMNI link and other
        links/networks. Relays run a dynamic routing protocol to discover any
        non-MNP prefixes in service on other links/networks. The Relay
        redistributes OMNI link MSP(s) into other links/networks, and
        redistributes non-MNP prefixes via OMNI link Bridge BGP peerings.<a href="#section-3.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

              S2, respectively. They receive MNP delegations X1 and X2, and
              also act as default routers for their associated physical or

</li>
          </ul>
<p id="section-3.2.1-5">An OMNI link configured over a single *NET appears as a single
          unified link with a consistent underlying network addressing plan;
          all nodes on the link can exchange carrier packets via simple *NET
          encapsulation (i.e., following any necessary NAT traversal) since
          the underlying *NET is connected. In common practice, however, OMNI
          links are often configured over an SRT spanning tree that bridges
          multiple distinct *NET segments managed under different
          administrative authorities (e.g., as for worldwide aviation service
          providers such as ARINC, SITA, Inmarsat, etc.). Individual *NETs may
          also be partitioned internally, in which case each internal
          partition appears as a separate segment.<a href="#section-3.2.1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.1-6">The addressing plan of each SRT segment is consistent internally
          but will often bear no relation to the addressing plans of other
          segments. Each segment is also likely to be separated from others by
          network security devices (e.g., firewalls, proxys, packet filtering
          gateways, etc.), and disjoint segments often have no common physical
          link connections. Therefore, nodes can only be assured of exchanging
          carrier packets directly with correspondents in the same segment,
          and not with those in other segments. The only means for joining the
          segments therefore is through inter-domain peerings between AERO
          Bridges.<a href="#section-3.2.1-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.1-7">The OMNI link spans multi-segment SRT topologies using the OMNI
          Adaptation Layer (OAL) <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> to
          provide the network layer with a virtual abstraction similar to a
          bridged campus LAN. The OAL is an OMNI interface sublayer that
          inserts a mid-layer IPv6 encapsulation header for inter-segment
          forwarding (i.e., bridging) without decrementing the network-layer
          TTL/Hop Limit of the original IP packet. An example OMNI link SRT is
          shown in <a href="#the-span" class="xref">Figure 2</a>:<a href="#section-3.2.1-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.2.1-9">Bridge, Proxy/Server and Relay OMNI interfaces are configured
          over both secured tunnels and open INET underlying interfaces within
          their respective SRT segments. Within each segment, Bridges
          configure "hub-and-spokes" BGP peerings with Proxy/Server/Relays as
          "spokes". Adjacent SRT segments are joined by Bridge-to-Bridge
          peerings to collectively form a spanning tree over the entire SRT.
          The "secured" spanning tree supports authentication and integrity
          for critical control plane messages. The "unsecured" spanning tree
          conveys ordinary carrier packets without security codes and that
          must be treated by destinations according to data origin
          authentication procedures. AERO nodes can employ route optimization
          to cause carrier packets to take more direct paths between OMNI link
          neighbors without having to follow strict spanning tree paths.<a href="#section-3.2.1-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.2.2-1">AERO nodes on OMNI links use the Link-Local Address (LLA) prefix

          network-layer addresses in link-scoped IPv6 ND and data messages.
          AERO Clients use LLAs constructed from MNPs (i.e., "MNP-LLAs") while
          other AERO nodes use LLAs constructed from administrative
          identification values ("ADM-LLAs") as specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>. Non-MNP routes are also

          is not properly covered by an MSP.<a href="#section-3.2.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.2-2">AERO nodes also use the Unique Local Address (ULA) prefix
          fd00::/8 followed by a pseudo-random 40-bit OMNI domain identifier
          to form the prefix [ULA]::/48, then include a 16-bit OMNI link
          identifier '*' to form the prefix [ULA*]::/64 <span>[<a href="#RFC4291" class="xref">RFC4291</a>]</span>. The AERO node then uses the prefix [ULA*]::/64
          to form "MNP-ULAs" or "ADM-ULA"s as specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> to support OAL addressing. (The
          prefix [ULA*]::/64 appearing alone and with no suffix represents
          "default".) AERO Clients also use Temporary ULAs constructed per
          <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>, where the addresses are

<p id="section-3.2.2-3">AERO MSPs, MNPs and non-MNP routes are typically based on Global
          Unicast Addresses (GUAs), but in some cases may be based on

<p id="section-3.2.3-1">The AERO routing system comprises a private Border Gateway
          Protocol (BGP) <span>[<a href="#RFC4271" class="xref">RFC4271</a>]</span> service coordinated between
          Bridges and Proxy/Servers. The service supports carrier packet
          forwarding at a layer below IP and does not interact with the public
          Internet BGP routing system, but supports redistribution of
          information for other links and networks discovered by Relays.<a href="#section-3.2.3-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.3-2">In a reference deployment, each Proxy/Server is configured as an
          Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) for a stub Autonomous System
          (AS) using a 32-bit AS Number (ASN) <span>[<a href="#RFC4271" class="xref">RFC4271</a>]</span> that is
          unique within the BGP instance, and each Proxy/Server further uses
          eBGP to peer with one or more Bridges but does not peer with other
          Proxy/Servers. Each SRT segment in the OMNI link must include one or
          more Bridges in a "hub" AS, which peer with the Proxy/Servers within
          that segment as "spoke" ASes. All Bridges within the same segment
          are members of the same hub AS, and use iBGP to maintain a
          consistent view of all active routes currently in service. The
          Bridges of different segments peer with one another using eBGP.<a href="#section-3.2.3-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.3-3">Bridges maintain forwarding table entries only for the MNP-ULAs
          corresponding to MNP and non-MNP routes that are currently active,
          while carrier packets destined to all other MNP-ULAs are dropped
          with a Destination Unreachable message returned due to the
          black-hole route. In this way, Proxy/Servers and Relays have only
          partial topology knowledge (i.e., they only maintain routing
          information for their directly associated Clients and non-AERO
          links) and they forward all other carrier packets to Bridges which
          have full topology knowledge.<a href="#section-3.2.3-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.3-4">Each OMNI link segment assigns a unique ADM-ULA sub-prefix of
          [ULA*]::/96 known as the "SRT prefix". For example, a first segment
          could assign [ULA*]::1000/116, a second could assign
          [ULA*]::2000/116, a third could assign [ULA*]::3000/116, etc. Within
          each segment, each Proxy/Server configures an ADM-ULA within the
          segment's SRT prefix, e.g., the Proxy/Servers within
          [ULA*]::2000/116 could assign the ADM-ULAs [ULA*]::2011/116,
          [ULA*]::2026/116, [ULA*]::2003/116, etc.<a href="#section-3.2.3-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.3-5">The administrative authorities for each segment must therefore
          coordinate to assure mutually-exclusive ADM-ULA prefix assignments,
          but internal provisioning of ADM-ULAs an independent local
          consideration for each administrative authority. For each ADM-ULA
          prefix, the Bridge(s) that connect that segment assign the
          all-zero's address of the prefix as a Subnet Router Anycast address.
          For example, the Subnet Router Anycast address for [ULA*]::1023/116
          is simply [ULA*]::1000.<a href="#section-3.2.3-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.3-6">ADM-ULA prefixes are statically represented in Bridge forwarding
          tables. Bridges join multiple SRT segments into a unified OMNI link
          over multiple diverse network administrative domains. They support a

<p id="section-3.2.4-5">The OMNI link control plane service distributes both Client

          regional node mobility and per-segment ADM-ULA prefix information
          that rarely changes. OMNI link Bridges and Proxy/Servers use the
          information to establish and maintain a forwarding plane spanning
          tree that connects all nodes on the link. The spanning tree supports
          a carrier packet virtual bridging service according to link-layer
          (instead of network-layer) information, but may often include longer
          paths than necessary. Each OMNI interface therefore also includes a
          Multilink Forwarding Information Base (MFIB) with Multilink
          Forwarding Vectors (MFVs) that can often provide more direct
          forwarding "shortcuts" that avoid strict spanning tree paths. As a

          distinct Segment Routing Topologies (SRTs). Each SRT is a
          mutually-exclusive OMNI link overlay instance using a distinct set
          of ULAs, and emulates a bridged campus LAN service for the OMNI
          link. In some cases (e.g., when redundant topologies are needed for
          fault tolerance and reliability) it may be beneficial to deploy
          multiple SRTs that act as independent overlay instances. A
          communication failure in one instance therefore will not affect
          communications in other instances.<a href="#section-3.2.5-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.5-2">Each SRT is identified by a distinct value in bits 48-63 of
          [ULA]::/48, i.e., as [ULA0]::/64, [ULA1]::/64, [ULA2]::/64, etc.
          Each OMNI interface is identified by a unique interface name (e.g.,
          omni0, omni1, omni2, etc.) and assigns an OMNI IPv6 anycast address
          used for OMNI interface determination in Safety-Based Multilink

<p id="section-3.2.5-3">The Bridges and Proxy/Servers of each independent SRT engage in
          BGP peerings to form a spanning tree with the Bridges in non-leaf
          nodes and the Proxy/Servers in leaf nodes. The spanning tree is
          configured over both secured and unsecured underlying network paths.
          The secured spanning tree is used to convey secured control messages
          between Hub, FHS and LHS Proxy/Servers, while the unsecured spanning
          tree forwards data messages and/or unsecured control messages.<a href="#section-3.2.5-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          selected OMNI link as either the IPv6 destination or as an
          intermediate hop within the SRH. This allows the original source to

          traverse when there may be multiple alternatives.<a href="#section-3.2.6-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.6-2">When an AERO node processes the SRH and forwards the original

          the next IPv6 address from the SRH into the IPv6 destination address
          and decrements Segments Left. If decrementing would cause Segments
          Left to become 0, the OMNI interface deletes the SRH before
          forwarding. This form of Segment Routing supports Safety-Based

          The FHS Proxy/Server next examines the LHS FMT code. If FMT-Forward
          is clear and FMT-Mode is set, the FHS Proxy/Server checks for a NCE
          for the ADM-LLA of the LHS Proxy/Server. If there is no NCE, the LHS
          Proxy/Server creates one in the INCOMPLETE state. If a new NCE was
          created (or if the existing NCE requires fresh window
          synchronization), the FHS Proxy/Server then writes window
          synchronization parameters into the OMNI Multilink Forwarding
          Parameters Tunnel Window Synchronization fields. The FHS
          Proxy/Server then selects an appropriate Identification value and
          *NET headers and forwards the resulting carrier packets into the
          secured spanning tree which will deliver them to a Bridge interface
          that assigns the FHS Subnet Router Anycast ULA.<a href="#section-3.2.7-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-10">If the OAL source is the FHS Client, it instead includes an
          authentication signature if necessary, performs OAL encapsulation,
          sets the source to its own MNP-ULA, sets the destination to
          {ADM,MNP}-ULA of the LHS destination and selects an appropriate
          Identification value for the LHS destination. The FHS Client then
          encapsulates the message in an additional OAL header with its own
          MNP-ULA as the source and the ADM-ULA of the FHS Proxy/Server as the
          destination, includes an appropriate Identification value and *NET
          headers then forwards the carrier packets to the FHS Proxy/Server.
          When the FHS Proxy/Server receives the carrier packets, it verifies
          the Identification, reassembles/decapsulates to obtain the
          solicitation then verifies the authentication signature. The FHS
          Proxy/Server then creates an MFV (i.e., the same as the FHS Client
          had done) while assigning the current B entry in the MFVI List
          (i.e., the one included by the FHS Client) as the "B2" MFVI for this
          MVF. The FHS Proxy/Server next generates a new unique "B1" MFVI,
          then both assigns it to the MFV and writes it as the next B entry in
          the OMNI Multilink Forwarding Parameters MFVI List (while also
          writing any FHS Client and Proxy/Server addressing information). The
          FHS Proxy/Server then checks LHS FMT-Forward/Mode to determine
          whether to create a NCE for the LHS Proxy/Server ADM-LLA and include
          Tunnel Window Synchronization parameters the same as above. The FHS
          Proxy/Server then re-fragments while setting the destination address
          to the FHS Subnet Router Anycast ULA. The FHS Proxy/Server finally
          includes appropriate *NET headers and forwards the carrier packets
          into the secured spanning tree the same as above.<a href="#section-3.2.7-10" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-11">Bridges in the spanning tree forward carrier packets not
          explicitly addressed to themselves, while forwarding those that
          arrived via the secured spanning tree to the next hop also via the
          secured spanning tree and forwarding all others via the unsecured
          spanning tree. When an FHS Bridge receives a carrier packet over the
          secured spanning tree addressed to its ADM-ULA or the FHS Subnet
          Router Anycast ULA, it instead reassembles/decapsulates to obtain
          the solicitation. The FHS Bridge next creates an MFV (i.e., the same
          as the FHS Proxy/Server had done) while assigning the current B
          entry in the MFVI List as the MFV "B2" index. The FHS Bridge also
          caches the solicitation Multilink Forwarding Parameters FHS
          information in the MFV, and also caches the first B entry in the
          MFVI List as "FHS-Client" when FHS FMT-Forward/Mode are both set to
          enable future direct forwarding to this FHS Client. The FHS Bridge
          then generates a "B1" MFVI for the MFV and also writes it as the
          next B entry in the solicitation's MFVI List.<a href="#section-3.2.7-11" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-12">The FHS Bridge then examines the SRT prefixes corresponding to
          both FHS and LHS. If the FHS Bridge has a local interface connection
          to both the FHS and LHS (whether they are the same or different
          segments), the FHS/LHS Bridge caches the solicitation LHS
          information, writes its ADM-ULA suffix and LHS INADDR into the
          solicitation OMNI Multilink Forwarding Parameters LHS fields, then
          sets the ADM-ULA of the LHS Proxy/Server as the destination. If the
          FHS and LHS prefixes are different, the FHS Bridge instead sets the
          LHS Subnet Router Anycast ULA as the destination. The FHS Bridge
          selects an appropriate Identification and *NET headers as above then
          forwards the carrier packets into the secured spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.2.7-12" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-13">When the FHS and LHS Bridges are different, the LHS Bridge will
          receive carrier packets over the secured spanning tree from the FHS
          Bridge. The LHS Bridge reassembles/decapsulates to obtain the
          solicitation then creates an MFV (i.e., the same as the FHS Bridge
          had done) while assigning the current B entry in the MFVI List as
          the MFV "B2" index. The LHS Bridge also caches the ADM-ULA of the
          FHS Bridge found in the Multilink Forwarding Parameters as the
          spanning tree address for "B2", caches the solicitation Multilink
          Forwarding Parameters LHS information then generates a "B1" MFVI for
          the MFV while also writing it as the next B entry in the MFVI List.
          The LHS Bridge also writes its own ADM-ULA suffix and LHS INADDR
          into the OMNI Multilink Forwarding Parameters. The LHS Bridge then
          sets the ADM-ULA of the LHS Proxy/Server as the OAL destination,
          selects appropriate *NET headers and forwards the carrier packets
          into the secured spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.2.7-13" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-14">When the LHS Proxy/Server receives the carrier packets from the
          secured spanning tree, it reassembles/decapsulates to obtain the
          solicitation then verifies that the LHS information supplied by the
          FHS source is consistent with its own cached information. If the
          information is consistent, the LHS Proxy/Server then creates an MFV
          and assigns the current B entry in the MFVI List as the "B2" MFVI
          the same as for the prior hop. If the solicitation destination is
          the MNP-LLA of the target Client, the LHS Proxy/Server also
          generates a "B1" MFVI and assigns it both to the MFVI and as the
          next B entry in the MFVI List. The LHS Proxy/Server then examines
          FHS FMT; if FMT-Forward is clear and FMT-Mode is set, the LHS
          Proxy/Server creates a NCE for the ADM-LLA of the FHS Proxy/Server
          (if necessary) and sets the state to STALE, then caches any Tunnel
          Window Synchronization parameters.<a href="#section-3.2.7-14" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-15">If the solicitation destination is its own ADM-LLA, the LHS
          Proxy/Server next prepares to return a solicited advertisement with
          Job code "01". If the solicitation source was the MNP-LLA of the FHS
          Client, the LHS Proxy/Server first creates or updates an NCE for the
          MNP-LLA with state set to STALE. The LHS Proxy/Server next caches
          the solicitation OMNI header window synchronization parameters and
          Multilink Forwarding Parameters information (including the MFVI
          List) in the NCE corresponding to the LLA source. When the LHS
          Proxy/Server forwards future carrier packets based on the NCE, it
          can populate reverse-path forwarding information in a CRH-32 routing
          header to enable forwarding based on the cached MFVI List B entries
          instead of ULA addresses.<a href="#section-3.2.7-15" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-16">The LHS Proxy/Server then creates an advertisement with Job code
          "01" while copying the solicitation OMNI Multilink Forwarding
          Parameters FHS/LHS information into the corresponding fields in the
          advertisement. The LHS Proxy/Server then generates an "A1" MFVI and
          both assigns it to the MFV and includes it as the first A entry in
          advertisement's MFVI List (see: <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> for details on MFVI List A/B
          processing). The LHS Proxy/Server then includes end-to-end window
          synchronization parameters in the OMIN header (if necessary) and
          also tunnel window synchronization parameters in the Multilink
          Forwarding Parameters Tunnel block (if necessary). The LHS
          Proxy/Server then encapsulates the advertisement, sets the source to
          its own ADM-ULA, sets the destination to the ADM-ULA of the LHS
          Bridge, selects an appropriate Identification value and *NET headers
          then forwards the carrier packets into the secured spanning
          tree.<a href="#section-3.2.7-16" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-17">If the solicitation destination was the MNP-LLA of the LHS
          Client, the LHS Proxy/Server instead includes an authentication
          signature in the solicitation, then encapsulates in an outer OAL
          header with its own ADM-ULA as the source and the MNP-ULA of the LHS
          Client as the destination. The LHS Proxy/Server then selects an
          appropriate Identification value, fragments if necessary, includes
          appropriate *NET headers and forwards the carrier packets to the LHS
          Client. When the LHS Client receives the carrier packets, it
          verifies the Identification and reassembles/decapsulates to obtain
          the solicitation. The LHS Client then creates a NCE for the
          solicitation LLA source address in the STALE state. If LHS
          FMT-Forward is set, FHS FMT-Forward is clear and the solicitation
          source was an MNP-LLA, the Client also creates a NCE for the ADM-LLA
          of the FHS Proxy/Server in the STALE state and caches any Tunnel
          Window Synchronization parameters. The Client then caches the
          solicitation OMNI header window synchronization parameters and
          Multilink Forwarding Parameters in the NCE corresponding to the
          solicitation LLA source, then creates an MFV and assigns both the
          current MFVI List B entry as "B2" and a locally generated "A1" MFVI
          the same as for previous hops (the LHS Client also includes the "A1"
          value in the solicited advertisement - see above and below). The LHS
          Client also caches the previous MFVI List B entry as "LHS-Bridge"
          since it can include this value when it sends future carrier packets
          directly to the Bridge (following appropriate neighbor
          coordination).<a href="#section-3.2.7-17" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-18">The LHS Client then prepares an advertisement using exactly the
          same procedures as for the LHS Proxy/Server above, except that it
          uses its MNP-LLA as the source. The LHS Client also includes an
          authentication signature, then encapsulates the advertisement with
          source set to its own ADM-ULA, destination set to the {ADM,MNP}-ULA
          of the FHS correspondent and with an appropriate Identification. The
          LHS Client then adds an additional OAL encapsulation with
          destination set to the ADM-ULA of the LHS Proxy/Server, includes an
          appropriate Identification and *NET headers and forwards the carrier
          packets to the LHS Proxy/Server. When the LHS Proxy/Server receives
          the carrier packets, it verifies the Identifications,
          reassembles/decapsulates to obtain the advertisement, verifies the
          authentication signature, then uses the current MVFI List B entry to
          locate the MFV. The LHS Proxy/Server then writes the current MFVI
          List A entry as the "A2" value for the MVF, generates an "A1" MFVI
          and both assigns it to the MFV and writes it as the next MFVI List A
          entry. The LHS Proxy/Server then examines the FHS/LHS FMT codes to
          determine if it needs to include Tunnel Window Synchronization
          parameters. The LHS Proxy/Server then re-fragments the advertisement
          while setting the OAL destination to the ADM-ULA of the LHS Bridge,
          includes an appropriate Identification and *NET headers and forwards
          the carrier packets into the secured spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.2.7-18" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          generates a new "A1" value which it both assigns the MFV and writes
          as the next MFVI List A entry. (The LHS Bridge also caches the first
          A entry in the MFVI List as "LHS-Client" when LHS FMT-Forward/Mode
          are both set to enable future direct forwarding to this LHS Client.)
          If the LHS Bridge is connected directly to both the FHS and LHS
          segments (whether the segments are the same or different), the
          FHS/LHS Bridge will have already cached the FHS/LHS information
          based on the original solicitation. The FHS/LHS Bridge then
          re-fragments the advertisement while setting the OAL destination to
          the ADM-ULA of the FHS Proxy/Server. If the FHS and LHS prefixes are
          different, the FHS Bridge instead re-fragments while setting the

          authentication signature then processes the message exactly the same
          as for the LHS Proxy/Server case above.<a href="#section-3.2.7-27" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-28">Following the solicitation/advertisement/acknowledgement
          exchange, OAL end systems and tunnel endpoints can begin exchanging
          ordinary carrier packets with Identification values within their
          respective send/receive windows without requiring security
          signatures and/or secured spanning tree traversal. Either peer can
          refresh window synchronization parameters and/or send other carrier
          packets requiring security at any time using the same secured
          procedures described above. OAL end systems and intermediate nodes
          can also use their own A1/B1 MFVIs when they receive carrier packets
          to unambiguously locate the correct MFV and determine directionality
          and can use any discovered A2/B2 MFVIs to forward carrier packets to
          other OAL nodes that configure the corresponding A1/B1 MFVIs. When
          an OAL node uses an MFVI included in a carrier packet to locate an
          MFV, it need not also examine the carrier packet addresses.<a href="#section-3.2.7-28" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-29">OAL sources can also begin including CRH-32s in carrier packets
          with a list of A/B MFVIs that OAL intermediate nodes can use for
          shortest-path carrier packet forwarding based on MFVIs instead of
          spanning tree addresses. OAL sources and intermediate nodes can also
          begin forwarding carrier packets with compressed headers (see: <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>) that include only a single A/B
          MFVI meaningful to the next hop, since all nodes in the path up to
          (and sometimes including) the OAL destination have already
          established MFV forwarding information. Note that when an FHS OAL
          source receives a solicited advertisement with Job code "01', the
          message will contain an MFVI List with A entries populated in the
          reverse order needed for populating a CRH-32 routing header. The FHS
          OAL source must therefore write the MFVI List A entries
          last-to-first when it populates a CRH-32, or must select the correct
          A entry to include in a compressed OAL header based on the intended
          OAL intermediate node or destination.<a href="#section-3.2.7-29" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-30">When a Bridge receives unsecured carrier packets destined to a
          local segment Client that has asserted direct reachability, the
          Bridge employs NAT traversal procedures to enable direct carrier
          packet forwarding while bypassing the local Proxy/Server based on
          the Client's advertised MFVIs and discovered NATed L2ADDR
          information. If the Client cannot be reached directly (or if NAT
          traversal has not yet converged), the Bridge instead forwards
          carrier packets directly to the local Proxy/Server.<a href="#section-3.2.7-30" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-31">When a Proxy/Server receives carrier packets destined to a local
          Client or forwards carrier packets received from a local Client, it
          first locates the correct MFV. If the carrier packets include a
          secured IPv6 ND message, the Proxy/Server uses the Client's MVF
          established through RS/RA exchanges to re-encapsulate/re-fragment
          while forwarding outbound secured carrier packets via the secured
          spanning tree and forwarding inbound secured carrier packets while
          including an authentication signature. For ordinary carrier packets,
          the Proxy/Server uses the same MFV if directed by MFVI and/or OAL
          addressing. Otherwise it locates an MFV established through an NS/NA
          exchange between the Client and the remote peer, and forwards the
          carrier packets without first reassembling/decapsulating.<a href="#section-3.2.7-31" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-32">When a Proxy/Server or Client configured as a tunnel ingress
          receives a carrier packet with a full header with an MNP-ULA source
          or a compressed header with an MFVI that matches an MFV, the ingress
          encapsulates the carrier packet in a new OAL full or compressed
          header with the inner header containing Identification values
          appropriate for the end-to-end window and the outer header
          containing an Identification value appropriate for the tunnel
          endpoints. When a Proxy/Server or Client configured as a tunnel
          egress receives an encapsulated carrier packet, it verifies the
          Identification in the outer header, then discards the outer header
          and forwards the inner carrier packet to the final destination.<a href="#section-3.2.7-32" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-33">When a source Client forwards carrier packets it can employ
          header compression according to the MFVIs established through an
          NS/NA exchange with a remote or local peer. When the source Client
          forwards to a remote peer, it can forward carrier packets to a local
          SRT Bridge (following the establishment of L2ADDR information) while
          bypassing the Proxy/Server. When a target Client receives carrier
          packets that match a local MFV, the Client first verifies the
          Identification then decompresses the headers if necessary,
          reassembles if necessary to obtain the OAL packet then decapsulates
          and delivers the IP packet to upper layers.<a href="#section-3.2.7-33" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.2.7-34">When synchronized peer Clients in the same SRT segment with
          FMT-Forward and FMT-Mode set discover each other's NATed L2ADDR
          addresses through NAT traversal, they can exchange carrier packets
          directly with header compression using MFVIs discovered as above.
          The FHS Client will have cached the A MFVI for the LHS Client, which
          will have cached the B MVFI for the FHS Client.<a href="#section-3.2.7-34" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-3.3-1">OMNI interfaces are virtual interfaces configured over one or more
        underlying interfaces classified as follows:<a href="#section-3.3-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-3.3-2.1">INET interfaces connect to an INET either natively or through
            one or more NATs. Native INET interfaces have global IP addresses
            that are reachable from any INET correspondent. The INET-facing
            interfaces of Proxy/Servers are native interfaces, as are Relay
            and Bridge interfaces. NATed INET interfaces connect to a private
            network behind one or more NATs that provide INET access. Clients
            that are behind a NAT are required to send periodic keepalive
            messages to keep NAT state alive when there are no carrier packets
            flowing.<a href="#section-3.3-2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.3-2.2">ANET interfaces connect to an ANET that is separated from the
            open INET by an FHS Proxy/Server. Clients can issue control
            messages over the ANET without including an authentication
            signature since the ANET is secured at the network layer or below.
            Proxy/Servers can actively issue control messages over the INET on
            behalf of ANET Clients to reduce ANET congestion.<a href="#section-3.3-2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.3-2.3">VPNed interfaces use security encapsulation over the INET to a
            Virtual Private Network (VPN) server that also acts as an FHS
            Proxy/Server. Other than the link-layer encapsulation format,
            VPNed interfaces behave the same as Direct interfaces.<a href="#section-3.3-2.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.3-2.4">Direct (i.e., single-hop point-to-point) interfaces connect a
            Client directly to an FHS Proxy/Server without crossing any
            ANET/INET paths. An example is a line-of-sight link between a
            remote pilot and an unmanned aircraft. The same Client
            considerations apply as for VPNed interfaces.<a href="#section-3.3-2.4" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
        </ul>
<p id="section-3.3-3">OMNI interfaces use OAL encapsulation and fragmentation as
        discussed in <a href="#encaps-and-route" class="xref">Section 3.2.4</a>. OMNI interfaces use
        *NET encapsulation (see: <a href="#aeroencaps" class="xref">Section 3.6</a>) to exchange
        carrier packets with OMNI link neighbors over INET or VPNed interfaces
        as well as over ANET interfaces for which the Client and FHS
        Proxy/Server may be multiple IP hops away. OMNI interfaces do not use
        link-layer encapsulation over Direct underlying interfaces or ANET
        interfaces when the Client and FHS Proxy/Server are known to be on the
        same underlying link.<a href="#section-3.3-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-4">OMNI interfaces maintain a neighbor cache for tracking per-neighbor
        state the same as for any interface. OMNI interfaces use IPv6 ND
        messages including Router Solicitation (RS), Router Advertisement
        (RA), Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) for
        neighbor cache management. In environments where spoofing may be a
        threat, OMNI neighbors should employ OAL Identification window
        synchronization in their IPv6 ND message exchanges.<a href="#section-3.3-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-5">OMNI interfaces send IPv6 ND messages with an OMNI option formatted
        as specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>. The OMNI
        option includes prefix registration information, Multilink Forwarding
        Parameters containing link information parameters for the OMNI
        interface's underlying interfaces and any other per-neighbor
        information.<a href="#section-3.3-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-6">A Client's OMNI interface may be configured over multiple
        underlying interfaces. For example, common mobile handheld devices
        have both wireless local area network ("WLAN") and cellular wireless
        links. These links are often used "one at a time" with low-cost WLAN
        preferred and highly-available cellular wireless as a standby, but a
        simultaneous-use capability could provide benefits. In a more complex
        example, aircraft frequently have many wireless data link types (e.g.
        satellite-based, cellular, terrestrial, air-to-air directional, etc.)
        with diverse performance and cost properties.<a href="#section-3.3-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-7">If a Client's multiple underlying interfaces are used "one at a
        time" (i.e., all other interfaces are in standby mode while one
        interface is active), then successive IPv6 ND messages all include
        OMNI option Multilink Forwarding Parameters sub-options with the same
        underlying interface index. In that case, the Client would appear to
        have a single underlying interface but with a dynamically changing
        link-layer address.<a href="#section-3.3-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-8">If the Client has multiple active underlying interfaces, then from
        the perspective of IPv6 ND it would appear to have multiple link-layer
        addresses. In that case, IPv6 ND message OMNI options MAY include
        Multilink Forwarding Parameters sub-options with different underlying
        interface indexes.<a href="#section-3.3-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-9">Bridge and Proxy/Server OMNI interfaces are configured over
        underlying interfaces that provide both secured tunnels for carrying
        IPv6 ND and BGP protocol control plane messages and open INET access
        for carrying unsecured messages. The OMNI interface configures both an
        ADM-LLA and its corresponding ADM-ULA, and acts as an OAL source to
        encapsulate and fragment original IP packets while presenting the
        resulting carrier packets over the secured or unsecured underlying
        paths. Note that Bridge and Proxy/Server BGP protocol TCP sessions are
        run directly over the OMNI interface and use ADM-ULA source and
        destination addresses. The OMNI interface employs the OAL to
        encapsulate the original IP packets for these sessions as carrier
        packets (i.e., even though the OAL header may use the same ADM-ULAs as
        the original IP header) and forwards them over the secured underlying
        path.<a href="#section-3.3-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.4-1">AERO Proxy/Servers and Clients configure OMNI interfaces as their
        point of attachment to the OMNI link. AERO nodes assign the MSPs for
        the link to their OMNI interfaces (i.e., as a "route-to-interface") to
        ensure that original IP packets with destination addresses covered by
        an MNP not explicitly associated with another interface are directed

<p id="section-3.4.1-1">When a Proxy/Server enables an OMNI interface, it assigns an
          ADM-{LLA,ULA} appropriate for the given OMNI link SRT segment. The
          Proxy/Server also configures secured tunnels with one or more
          neighboring Bridges and engages in BGP routing protocol sessions
          with one or more Bridges.<a href="#section-3.4.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.4.1-2">The OMNI interface provides a single interface abstraction to the
          IP layer, but internally includes an NBMA nexus for sending carrier
          packets to OMNI interface neighbors over underlying INET interfaces
          and secured tunnels. The Proxy/Server further configures a service
          to facilitate IPv6 ND exchanges with AERO Clients and manages
          per-Client neighbor cache entries and IP forwarding table entries
          based on control message exchanges.<a href="#section-3.4.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.4.1-3">Relays are simply Proxy/Servers that run a dynamic routing
          protocol to redistribute routes between the OMNI interface and
          INET/EUN interfaces (see: <a href="#scaling" class="xref">Section 3.2.3</a>). The Relay
          provisions MNPs to networks on the INET/EUN interfaces (i.e., the
          same as a Client would do) and advertises the MSP(s) for the OMNI
          link over the INET/EUN interfaces. The Relay further provides an
          attachment point of the OMNI link to a non-MNP-based global

<p id="section-3.4.2-1">When a Client enables an OMNI interface, it assigns either an
          MNP-{LLA, ULA} or a Temporary ULA and sends RS messages over its
          underlying interfaces to an FHS Proxy/Server, which returns an RA
          message with corresponding parameters. The RS/RA messages may pass
          through one or more NATs in the case of a Client's INET interface.
          (Note: if the Client used a Temporary ULA in its initial RS message,
          it will discover an MNP-{LLA, ULA} in the corresponding RA that it
          receives from the FHS Proxy/Server and begin using these new
          addresses. If the Client is operating outside the context of AERO
          infrastructure such as in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), however,
          it may continue using Temporary ULAs for Client-to-Client

        </h3>
<p id="section-3.5-1">Each OMNI interface maintains a conceptual neighbor cache that
        includes a Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) for each of its active neighbors
        on the OMNI link per <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>. Each NCE is indexed by
        the LLA of the neighbor, while the OAL encapsulation ULA determines
        the context for Identification verification. Clients and Proxy/Servers
        maintain NCEs through RS/RA exchanges, and also maintain NCEs for any
        active correspondent peers through NS/NA exchanges.<a href="#section-3.5-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.5-2">Bridges also maintain NCEs for Clients within their local segments
        based on NS/NA route optimization. When a Bridge creates/updates a NCE
        for a local segment Client based on NS/NA route optimization, it also
        maintains MVFI and L2ADDR state for messages destined to this local
        segment Client.<a href="#section-3.5-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.5-3">Hub Proxy/Servers add an additional state DEPARTED to the list of
        NCE states found in Section 7.3.2 of <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>. When a
        Client terminates its association, the Proxy/Server OMNI interface
        sets a "DepartTime" variable for the NCE to "DEPART_TIME" seconds.
        DepartTime is decremented unless a new IPv6 ND message causes the
        state to return to REACHABLE. While a NCE is in the DEPARTED state,
        the Proxy/Server forwards carrier packets destined to the target
        Client to the Client's new Hub instead. When DepartTime decrements to
        0, the NCE is deleted. It is RECOMMENDED that DEPART_TIME be set to
        the default constant value REACHABLE_TIME plus 10 seconds (40 seconds
        by default) to allow a window for carrier packets in flight to be
        delivered while stale route optimization state may be present.<a href="#section-3.5-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.5-4">Only Clients and their current Hub Proxy/Servers have full
        knowledge of the Client's underlying Interface Attributes; other
        Proxy/Servers acting in "proxy" mode have knowledge of only the
        individual Client underlying interfaces they service. When the Client
        is configured to create NCEs on its own behalf, it is responsible for
        sending mobility signaling messages to its current correspondents. If
        the Client is unable to provide mobility signaling on its own behalf,
        it should instead engage its Proxy/Servers in "mobility anchor" mode

<p id="section-3.5-5">Clients act as RORs on their own behalf when they receive an NS(AR)
        from a Hub Proxy/Server. Relays instead act as RORs on behalf of their
        associated non-MNP targets. When a Relay receives an authentic NS(AR)
        message with a non-MNP target, it first searches for a routing table
        entry for the non-MNP destination and accepts the message only if
        there is an entry. When the ROS receives a solicited NA(AR) message
        response to its NS(AR), it creates or updates a NCE for the target
        network-layer and link-layer addresses. The ROS then (re)sets
        ReachableTime for the NCE to REACHABLE_TIME seconds and performs
        reachability tests over specific underlying interface pairs to
        determine paths for forwarding carrier packets directly to the target.
        The ROS otherwise decrements ReachableTime while no further solicited
        NA messages arrive. It is RECOMMENDED that REACHABLE_TIME be set to
        the default constant value 30 seconds as specified in <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3.5-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.5.1-1">OMNI interfaces prepare IPv6 ND messages the same as for standard
          IPv6 ND, but also include a new option type termed the OMNI option

          ND messages the same as for standard IPv6 ND, and include one or
          more OMNI options and any other options then completely populate all
          option information. If the OMNI interface includes an authentication
          signature, it sets the IPv6 ND message Checksum field to 0 and
          calculates the authentication signature over the entire length of
          the message (beginning with a pseudo-header of the IPv6 header) but
          does not then proceed to calculate the IPv6 ND message checksum
          itself. If the OMNI interface forwards the message to a next hop
          over the secured spanning tree path, it omits both the
          authentication signature and checksum since lower layers already
          ensure authentication and integrity. In all other cases, the OMNI
          interface calculates the standard IPv6 ND message checksum and
          writes the value in the Checksum field. OMNI interfaces verify
          authentication and integrity of each IPv6 ND message received
          according to the specific check(s) included, and process the message
          further only following verification.<a href="#section-3.5.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          information is stored in the neighbor cache and provides the basis
          for the forwarding algorithm specified in <a href="#aeroalg" class="xref">Section 3.10</a>.
          The information is cumulative and reflects the union of the OMNI
          information from the most recent IPv6 ND messages received from the
          neighbor; it is therefore not required that each IPv6 ND message

          specification (e.g., <span>[<a href="#RFC2464" class="xref">RFC2464</a>]</span>). If both an OMNI

          advertisement replies. If an OMNI IPv6 ND solicitation message
          includes a Nonce option, the advertisement reply must echo the same
          Nonce. If an OMNI IPv6 ND solicitation message includes a Timestamp

        the original IP packet should instead be forwarded back to the network
        layer, the packet is dropped to avoid looping). Carrier packets that
        enter the OMNI interface from the link layer are either
        re-encapsulated and re-admitted into the OMNI link, or reassembled and
        forwarded to the network layer where they are subject to either local
        delivery or IP forwarding. In all cases, the OAL MUST NOT decrement

        Attributes and/or Traffic Selectors (e.g., port number, flow
        specification, etc.) to select an outbound underlying interface for
        each OAL packet and also to select segment routing and/or link-layer
        destination addresses based on the neighbor's underlying interfaces.
        AERO implementations SHOULD permit network management to dynamically
        adjust Traffic Selector values at runtime.<a href="#section-3.10-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10-4">If an OAL packet matches the Traffic Selectors of multiple outgoing
        interfaces and/or neighbor interfaces, the OMNI interface replicates
        the packet and sends one copy via each of the (outgoing / neighbor)
        interface pairs; otherwise, it sends a single copy of the OAL packet
        via an interface with the best matching Traffic Selector. (While not
        strictly required, the likelihood of successful reassembly may improve
        when the OMNI interface sends all fragments of the same fragmented OAL
        packet consecutively over the same underlying interface pair to avoid
        complicating factors such as delay variance and reordering.) AERO
        nodes keep track of which underlying interfaces are currently
        "reachable" or "unreachable", and only use "reachable" interfaces for
        forwarding purposes.<a href="#section-3.10-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10-5">The following sections discuss the OMNI interface forwarding
        algorithms for Clients, Proxy/Servers and Bridges. In the following
        discussion, an original IP packet's destination address is said to
        "match" if it is the same as a cached address, or if it is covered by
        a cached prefix (which may be encoded in an MNP-LLA).<a href="#section-3.10-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          </h4>
<p id="section-3.10.1-1">When an original IP packet enters a Client's OMNI interface from
          the network layer the Client searches for a NCE that matches the
          destination. If there is a match, the Client selects one or more
          "reachable" neighbor interfaces in the entry for forwarding
          purposes. If there is no NCE, the Client instead invokes route
          optimization via an FHS Proxy/Server while also forwarding the
          original IP packet(s) as part of an OAL super-packet combined with
          the secured route optimization control message. The Client (acting
          as an OAL source) performs OAL encapsulation and sets the OAL
          destination address to the MNP-ULA of the target. The Client then
          inserts an authentication signature if necessary and adds an
          additional OAL encapsulation header with the OAL destination set to
          the ADM-ULA of the FHS Proxy/Server. If the Client has multiple
          original IP packets to send to the same neighbor, it can concatenate
          them in a single super-packet <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>. The OAL source then performs
          fragmentation to create OAL fragments (see: <a href="#aeromtu" class="xref">Section 3.9</a>), appends any *NET encapsulation, and sends the
          resulting carrier packets over underlying interfaces to the neighbor
          acting as an OAL destination.<a href="#section-3.10.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.1-2">If the neighbor interface selected for forwarding is located on
          the same OMNI link segment and not behind a NAT, the Client forwards
          the carrier packets directly according to the L2ADDR information for
          the neighbor. If the neighbor interface is behind a NAT on the same
          OMNI link segment, the Client instead forwards the initial carrier
          packets to the LHS Proxy/Server (while inserting an CRH-32 if
          necessary) and initiates NAT traversal procedures. If the Client's
          intended source underlying interface is also behind a NAT and
          located on the same OMNI link segment, it sends a "direct bubble"
          over the interface per <span>[<a href="#RFC6081" class="xref">RFC6081</a>]</span><span>[<a href="#RFC4380" class="xref">RFC4380</a>]</span> to the L2ADDR found in the neighbor cache in
          order to establish state in its own NAT by generating traffic toward
          the neighbor (note that no response to the bubble is expected).<a href="#section-3.10.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.1-3">The Client next sends an NS(NUD) message toward the MNP-ULA of
          the neighbor via the LHS Proxy/Server as discussed in <a href="#nud" class="xref">Section 3.15</a>. If the Client receives an NA(NUD) from the neighbor
          over the underlying interface, it marks the neighbor interface as
          "trusted" and sends future carrier packets directly to the L2ADDR
          information for the neighbor instead of indirectly via the LHS
          Proxy/Server. The Client must honor the neighbor cache maintenance
          procedure by sending additional direct bubbles and/or NS/NA(NUD)
          messages as discussed in <span>[<a href="#RFC6081" class="xref">RFC6081</a>]</span><span>[<a href="#RFC4380" class="xref">RFC4380</a>]</span> in order to keep NAT state alive as long as
          carrier packets are still flowing.<a href="#section-3.10.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.1-4">When a carrier packet enters a Client's OMNI interface from the
          link-layer, if the OAL destination matches one of the Client's ULAs
          the Client (acting as an OAL destination) verifies that the
          Identification is in-window for this OAL source, then reassembles
          and decapsulates as necessary and delivers the original IP packet to
          the network layer. If the OAL destination does not match, the Client
          drops the original IP packet and MAY return a network-layer ICMP
          Destination Unreachable message subject to rate limiting (see: <a href="#aeroerr" class="xref">Section 3.11</a>).<a href="#section-3.10.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.1-5">Note: When a Client performs an NS/NA route optimization exchange
          with a peer over the spanning tree, MFIB information will be
          established in all FHS and LHS intermediate nodes in the path. The
          Client can then opportunistically "skip ahead" in the chain of hops
          to bypass intermediate nodes that are not required to forward
          packets. The Client will have the map of MFVIs held at each hop, and
          can include the MFVI for the first hop it visits in a compressed
          OMNI header or in a CRH-32 routing header.<a href="#section-3.10.1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.1-6">Note: Clients and their FHS Proxy/Server (and other Client) peers
          can exchange original IP packets over ANET underlying interfaces
          without invoking the OAL, since the ANET is secured at the link and
          physical layers. By forwarding original IP packets without invoking
          the OAL, however, the ANET peers can engage only in classical path
          MTU discovery since the packets are subject to loss and/or
          corruption due to the various per-link MTU limitations that may
          occur within the ANET. Moreover, the original IP packets do not
          include either the OAL integrity check or per-packet Identification
          values that can be used for data origin authentication and
          link-layer retransmissions. The tradeoff therefore involves an
          assessment of the per-packet encapsulation overhead saved by
          bypassing the OAL vs. inheritance of classical network
          "brittleness". (Note however that ANET peers can send small original
          IP packets without invoking the OAL, while invoking the OAL for
          larger packets. This presents the beneficial aspects of both small
          packet efficiency and large packet robustness, with delay variance
          and reordering as possible side effects.)<a href="#section-3.10.1-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.10.2-1">When the Proxy/Server receives an original IP packet from the
          network layer, it drops the packet if routing indicates that it
          should be forwarded back to the network layer to avoid looping.
          Otherwise, the Proxy/Server regards the original IP packet the same
          as if it had arrived as carrier packets with OAL destination set to
          its own ADM-ULA. When the Proxy/Server receives carrier packets on
          underlying interfaces with OAL destination set to its own ADM-ULA,
          it performs OAL reassembly if necessary to obtain the original IP
          packet.<a href="#section-3.10.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.2-2">The Proxy/Server next searches for a NCE that matches the
          original IP destination and proceeds as follows:<a href="#section-3.10.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-3.10.2-3.1">if the packet is an NA message for a local Client NCE, the
              Proxy/Server examines the Multilink Forwarding Parameters
              information and rewrites the fields if the NA was not already
              processed by a (local segment) Bridge as discussed in <a href="#segspan" class="xref">Section 3.2.7</a>.<a href="#section-3.10.2-3.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a>

            <li class="normal" id="section-3.10.2-3.2">else, if the original IP packet destination matches a NCE,
              the Proxy/Sever uses one or more "reachable" neighbor interfaces
              in the entry for packet forwarding using OAL encapsulation and
              fragmentation according to the cached link-layer address
              information. If the neighbor interface is in a different OMNI
              link segment, the Proxy/Server performs OAL encapsulation and
              fragmentation, inserts an CRH-32 if necessary and forwards the
              resulting carrier packets via the spanning tree to a Bridge;
              otherwise, it forwards the carrier packets directly to the
              neighbor via INET encapsulation. If the neighbor is behind a
              NAT, this FHS Proxy/Server instead forwards initial carrier
              packets via a Bridge (or more directly via an LHS Proxy/Server)
              while sending an NS(NUD) to the neighbor. When the Proxy/Server
              receives the NA(NUD), it can begin forwarding carrier packets
              directly to the neighbor the same as discussed in <a href="#cforw" class="xref">Section 3.10.1</a> while sending additional NS(NUD) messages as
              necessary to maintain NAT state. Note that no direct bubbles are
              necessary since the Proxy/Server is by definition not located
              behind a NAT.<a href="#section-3.10.2-3.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a>

          accepts the carrier packet only if data origin authentication
          succeeds and if there is a network layer routing table entry for a
          GUA route that matches the MNP-ULA. If there is no route, the
          Proxy/Server drops the carrier packet; otherwise, it reassembles and
          decapsulates to obtain the original IP packet then acts as a Relay
          to present it to the network layer where it will be delivered
          according to standard IP forwarding.<a href="#section-3.10.2-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.2-5">When a Proxy/Server receives a carrier packet from one of its
          Client neighbors with OAL destination set to another node, it
          forwards the packets via a matching NCE or via the spanning tree if
          there is no matching entry. When the Proxy/Server receives a carrier
          packet with OAL destination set to the MNP-ULA of one of its Client
          neighbors established through RS/RA exchanges, it accepts the
          carrier packet only if data origin authentication succeeds. If the
          NCE state is DEPARTED, the Proxy/Server changes the OAL destination
          address to the ADM-ULA of the new Proxy/Server, then re-encapsulates
          the carrier packet and forwards it to a Bridge which will eventually
          deliver it to the new Proxy/Server.<a href="#section-3.10.2-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.2-6">If the neighbor cache state for the MNP-ULA is REACHABLE, the
          Proxy/Server forwards the carrier packets to the Client which then
          must reassemble. (Note that the Proxy/Server does not reassemble
          carrier packets not explicitly addressed to its own ADM-ULA, since
          some of the carrier packets of the same original IP packet could be
          forwarded through a different Proxy/Server.) In that case, the
          Client may receive fragments that are smaller than its link MTU but
          that can still be reassembled.<a href="#section-3.10.2-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.2-7">FHS Clients maintain a single Hub Proxy/Server and one or more
          FHS Proxy/Servers. FHS Clients can forward carrier packets to the
          FHS Proxy/Server for a specific outbound underlying interface while
          also initiating route optimization, and the FHS Proxy/Server will
          reassemble, re-encapsulate and re-fragment then send the resulting
          carrier packets into the secured spanning tree subject to rate
          limiting while route optimization is in progress. The secured
          spanning tree carrier packets will arrive at the Hub LHS
          Proxy/Server for an LHS Client, which reassembles, re-encapsulates,
          re-fragments and forwards to the LHS Client. Once route optimization
          has converged, the FHS and LHS Clients can enact "shortcuts" to
          avoid slow-path forwarding of carrier packets over the secured
          spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.10.2-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.2-8">Proxy/Servers process carrier packets with OAL destinations that
          do not match their ADM-ULA in the same manner as for traditional IP
          forwarding within the OAL, i.e., nodes use IP forwarding to forward
          packets not explicitly addressed to themselves. Proxy/Servers
          process carrier packets with their ADM-ULA as the destination by
          first examining the packet for a CRH-32 header or a compressed OAL
          header. In that case, the Proxy/Server examines the next MFVI in the
          carrier packet to locate the MFV entry in the MFIB for next hop
          forwarding (i.e., without examining IP addresses). When the
          Proxy/Server forwards the carrier packet, it changes the destination
          address according to the MFVI value for the next hop found either in
          the CRH-32 header or in the node's own MFIB.<a href="#section-3.10.2-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.10.2-9">Note: Proxy/Servers may receive carrier packets with CRH-32s that
          include additional forwarding information. Proxy/Servers use the
          forwarding information to determine the correct NCE and underlying
          interface for forwarding to the target Client, then remove the
          CRH-32 and forward the carrier packet. If necessary, the
          Proxy/Server reassembles first before re-encapsulating (and possibly
          also re-fragmenting) then forwards to the target Client. For a full
          discussion see: <a href="#postro" class="xref">Section 3.14.6</a>.<a href="#section-3.10.2-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.10.2-11">Note: When a Proxy/Server receives a (non-OAL) original IP packet
          from an ANET Client, or a carrier packet with OAL destination set to
          its own ADM-ULA from any Client, the Proxy/Server reassembles if
          necessary then performs ROS functions on behalf of the Client. The
          Client may at some later time begin sending carrier packets to the
          OAL address of the actual target instead of the Proxy/Server, at
          which point it may begin functioning as an ROS on its own behalf and
          thereby "override" the Proxy/Server's ROS role.<a href="#section-3.10.2-11" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          packets received from an ANET/INET Client) with a destination that
          corresponds to the Client's delegated MNP. Similarly, Proxy/Servers
          drop any carrier packet received with both a source and destination
          that correspond to the Client's delegated MNP regardless of their
          OMNI link point of origin. These checks are necessary to prevent

          the secured spanning tree, and may convey other carrier packets via
          the unsecured spanning tree or via more direct paths according to
          MFIB information. When the Bridge receives a carrier packet, it

          examining the packet for a CRH-32 header or a compressed OAL header.
          In that case, the Bridge examines the next MFVI in the carrier
          packet to locate the MFV entry in the MFIB for next hop forwarding
          (i.e., without examining IP addresses). When the Bridge forwards the

<p id="section-3.11-1">When an AERO node admits an original IP packet into the OMNI
        interface, it may receive link-layer or network-layer error
        indications. The AERO node may also receive OMNI link error
        indications in OAL-encapsulated uNA messages that include
        authentication signatures.<a href="#section-3.11-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.11-2">A link-layer error indication is an ICMP error message generated by
        a router in the INET on the path to the neighbor or by the neighbor
        itself. The message includes an IP header with the address of the node
        that generated the error as the source address and with the link-layer
        address of the AERO node as the destination address.<a href="#section-3.11-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.11-3">The IP header is followed by an ICMP header that includes an error
        Type, Code and Checksum. Valid type values include "Destination
        Unreachable", "Time Exceeded" and "Parameter Problem" <span>[<a href="#RFC0792" class="xref">RFC0792</a>]</span><span>[<a href="#RFC4443" class="xref">RFC4443</a>]</span>. (OMNI interfaces ignore
        link-layer IPv4 "Fragmentation Needed" and IPv6 "Packet Too Big"
        messages for carrier packets that are no larger than the minimum/path
        MPS as discussed in <a href="#aeromtu" class="xref">Section 3.9</a>, however these messages
        may provide useful hints of probe failures during path MPS
        probing.)<a href="#section-3.11-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.11-4">The ICMP header is followed by the leading portion of the carrier
        packet that generated the error, also known as the "packet-in-error".
        For ICMPv6, <span>[<a href="#RFC4443" class="xref">RFC4443</a>]</span> specifies that the
        packet-in-error includes: "As much of invoking packet as possible
        without the ICMPv6 packet exceeding the minimum IPv6 MTU" (i.e., no
        more than 1280 bytes). For ICMPv4, <span>[<a href="#RFC0792" class="xref">RFC0792</a>]</span> specifies
        that the packet-in-error includes: "Internet Header + 64 bits of
        Original Data Datagram", however <span>[<a href="#RFC1812" class="xref">RFC1812</a>]</span> Section
        4.3.2.3 updates this specification by stating: "the ICMP datagram
        SHOULD contain as much of the original datagram as possible without
        the length of the ICMP datagram exceeding 576 bytes".<a href="#section-3.11-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          <li class="normal" id="section-3.11-8.2">When an AERO node receives persistent link-layer Time Exceeded
            messages, the IP ID field may be wrapping before earlier fragments
            awaiting reassembly have been processed. In that case, the node
            should begin including integrity checks and/or institute rate
            limits for subsequent packets.<a href="#section-3.11-8.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.11-8.3">When an AERO node receives persistent link-layer Destination
            Unreachable messages in response to carrier packets that it sends
            to one of its neighbor correspondents, the node should process the
            message as an indication that a path may be failing, and
            optionally initiate NUD over that path. If it receives Destination
            Unreachable messages over multiple paths, the node should allow
            future carrier packets destined to the correspondent to flow
            through a default route and re-initiate route optimization.<a href="#section-3.11-8.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>

            to one of its neighbor Proxy/Servers, the Client should mark the
            path as unusable and use another path. If it receives Destination
            Unreachable messages on many or all paths, the Client should
            associate with a new Proxy/Server and release its association with
            the old Proxy/Server as specified in <a href="#newsrv" class="xref">Section 3.16.5</a>.<a href="#section-3.11-8.4" class="pilcrow">¶</a>

            indication that the path to the neighbor may be failing. However,
            the dynamic routing protocol should soon reconverge and correct
            the temporary outage.<a href="#section-3.11-8.6" class="pilcrow">¶</a>

        network-layer destination address is covered by an MSP, the Bridge
        drops the packet if there is no more-specific routing information for

        message subject to rate limiting.<a href="#section-3.11-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.11-10">When an AERO node receives a carrier packet for which reassembly is

          </h4>
<p id="section-3.12.1-1">Each AERO Proxy/Server on the OMNI link is configured to
          facilitate Client prefix delegation/registration requests. Each
          Proxy/Server is provisioned with a database of MNP-to-Client ID
          mappings for all Clients enrolled in the AERO service, as well as
          any information necessary to authenticate each Client. The Client
          database is maintained by a central administrative authority for the
          OMNI link and securely distributed to all Proxy/Servers, e.g., via
          the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) <span>[<a href="#RFC4511" class="xref">RFC4511</a>]</span>, via static configuration, etc. Clients receive
          the same service regardless of the Proxy/Servers they select.<a href="#section-3.12.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.1-2">Clients associate each of their underlying interfaces with a FHS
          Proxy/Server. Each FHS Proxy/Server locally services one or more of
          the Client's underlying interfaces, and the Client typically selects
          one among them to serve as the Hub Proxy/Server (the Client may
          instead select a "third-party" Hub Proxy/Server that does not
          directly service any of its underlying interfaces). All of the
          Client's other FHS Proxy/Servers forward proxyed copies of RS/RA
          messages between the Hub Proxy/Server and Client without assuming
          the Hub role functions themselves.<a href="#section-3.12.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.1-3">Each Client associates with a single Hub Proxy/Server at a time,
          while all other Proxy/Servers are candidates for providing the Hub
          role for other Clients. An FHS Proxy/Server assumes the Hub role
          when it receives an RS message with its own ADM-LLA or link-scoped
          All-Routers multicast as the destination. An FHS Proxy/Server
          assumes the proxy role when it receives an RS message with the
          ADM-LLA of another Proxy/Server as the destination. (An FHS
          Proxy/Server can also assume the proxy role when it receives an RS
          message addressed to link-scoped All-Routers multicast if it can
          determine the ADM-LLA of another Proxy/Server to serve as a
          Hub.)<a href="#section-3.12.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.1-4">AERO Clients and Proxy/Servers use IPv6 ND messages to maintain
          neighbor cache entries. AERO Proxy/Servers configure their OMNI
          interfaces as advertising NBMA interfaces, and therefore send
          unicast RA messages with a short Router Lifetime value (e.g.,
          ReachableTime seconds) in response to a Client's RS message.
          Thereafter, Clients send additional RS messages to keep Proxy/Server
          state alive.<a href="#section-3.12.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.1-5">AERO Clients and Hub Proxy/Servers include prefix delegation
          and/or registration parameters in RS/RA messages (see <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>). The IPv6 ND messages are
          exchanged between the Client and Hub Proxy/Server (via any FHS
          Proxy/Servers acting as proxys) according to the prefix management
          schedule required by the service. If the Client knows its MNP in
          advance, it can employ prefix registration by including its MNP-LLA
          as the source address of an RS message and with an OMNI option with
          valid prefix registration information for the MNP. If the Hub
          Proxy/Server accepts the Client's MNP assertion, it injects the MNP
          into the routing system and establishes the necessary neighbor cache
          state. If the Client does not have a pre-assigned MNP, it can
          instead employ prefix delegation by including the unspecified
          address (::) as the source address of an RS message and with an OMNI
          option with prefix delegation parameters to request an MNP.<a href="#section-3.12.1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          </h4>
<p id="section-3.12.2-1">AERO Clients discover the addresses of candidate Proxy/Servers by
          resolving the Potential Router List (PRL) in a similar manner as
          described in <span>[<a href="#RFC5214" class="xref">RFC5214</a>]</span>. Discovery methods include
          static configuration (e.g., a flat-file map of Proxy/Server
          addresses and locations), or through an automated means such as
          Domain Name System (DNS) name resolution <span>[<a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">RFC1035</a>]</span>.
          Alternatively, the Client can discover Proxy/Server addresses
          through a layer 2 data link login exchange, or through a unicast RA
          response to a multicast/anycast RS as described below. In the
          absence of other information, the Client can resolve the DNS
          Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) "linkupnetworks.[domainname]"
          where "linkupnetworks" is a constant text string and "[domainname]"
          is a DNS suffix for the OMNI link (e.g., "example.com").<a href="#section-3.12.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-2">To associate with a Hub Proxy/Server over a first underlying
          interface, the Client acts as a requesting router to request MNPs by
          preparing an RS message with prefix management parameters. If the
          Client already knows the Proxy/Server's ADM-LLA, it includes the LLA
          as the network-layer destination address; otherwise, the Client
          includes link-scoped All-Routers multicast as the network-layer
          destination. The Client can use its MNP-LLA as the network-layer
          source address and include an OMNI option with prefix registration
          information. If the Client does not yet have an MNP-LLA, it instead
          sets the network-layer source address to unspecified (::) and
          includes prefix delegation parameters in the OMNI option (see: <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>).<a href="#section-3.12.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-3">The Client next includes an authentication sub-option if
          necessary and an Interface Attributes sub-option corresponding to
          the underlying interface over which it will send the RS message.
          Next, the Client submits the RS for OAL encapsulation and
          fragmentation if necessary with its own MNP-ULA and the
          Proxy/Server's ADM-ULA or an OMNI IPv6 anycast address as the OAL
          addresses while selecting an Identification value and invoking
          window synchronization as specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3.12.2-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-4">The Client then sends the RS (either directly via Direct
          interfaces, via a VPN for VPNed interfaces, via an access router for
          ANET interfaces or via INET encapsulation for INET interfaces) then
          waits up to RetransTimer milliseconds for an RA message reply (see
          <a href="#aeropd-server" class="xref">Section 3.12.3</a>) (retrying up to
          MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS). If the Client receives no RAs, or if it
          receives an RA with Router Lifetime set to 0, the Client SHOULD
          abandon attempts through the first candidate Proxy/Server and try
          another Proxy/Server. Otherwise, the Client processes the prefix
          information found in the RA message.<a href="#section-3.12.2-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-5">When the Client processes an RA, it first performs OAL reassembly
          and decapsulation if necessary then creates NCEs for both the FHS
          and Hub Proxy/Server ADM-LLAs as the network-layer address and the
          FHS/Hub Proxy/Server's encapsulation and/or link-layer addresses as
          the link-layer address. The Client then caches the Interface
          Attributes information, records the RA Router Lifetime field value
          in the NCE as the time for which the Hub Proxy/Server has committed
          to maintaining the MNP in the routing system, and caches the other
          RA configuration information including Cur Hop Limit, M and O flags,
          Reachable Time and Retrans Timer. The Client then autoconfigures
          MNP-LLAs for any delegated MNPs and assigns them to the OMNI
          interface. The Client also caches any MSPs included in Route
          Information Options (RIOs) <span>[<a href="#RFC4191" class="xref">RFC4191</a>]</span> as MSPs to
          associate with the OMNI link, and assigns the MTU value in the MTU
          option to the underlying interface.<a href="#section-3.12.2-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-6">The Client then registers its additional underlying interfaces
          with FHS Proxy/Servers for those interfaces discovered by sending RS
          messages via each additional interface but with the ADM-LLA of the
          Hub Proxy/Server as the destination. The additional FHS
          Proxy/Servers will assume the proxy role and forward proxyed copies
          of the RS/RA exchanges between the Client and Hub Proxy/Server. The
          Client finally sub-delegates the MNPs to its attached EUNs and/or
          the Client's own internal virtual interfaces as described in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-v6ops-pdhost" class="xref">I-D.templin-v6ops-pdhost</a>]</span> to support the Client's
          downstream attached "Internet of Things (IoT)". The Client then
          sends additional RS messages over each underlying interface before
          the Router Lifetime received for that interface expires.<a href="#section-3.12.2-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-7">After the Client registers its underlying interfaces, it may wish
          to change one or more registrations, e.g., if an interface changes
          address or becomes unavailable, if traffic selectors change, etc. To
          do so, the Client prepares an RS message to send over any available
          underlying interface as above. The RS includes an OMNI option with
          prefix registration/delegation information and with an Interface
          Attributes sub-option specific to the selected underlying interface.
          When the Client receives the Hub Proxy/Server's RA response, it has
          assurance that both the Hub and FHS Proxy/Servers have been updated
          with the new information.<a href="#section-3.12.2-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.2-8">If the Client wishes to discontinue use of a Hub Proxy/Server it
          issues an RS message over any underlying interface with an OMNI
          option with a prefix release indication. When the Hub Proxy/Server
          processes the message, it releases the MNP, sets the NCE state for
          the Client to DEPARTED and returns an RA reply with Router Lifetime
          set to 0. After a short delay (e.g., 2 seconds), the Hub
          Proxy/Server withdraws the MNP from the routing system.<a href="#section-3.12.2-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.12.3-1">AERO Proxy/Servers act as both IP routers and IPv6 ND proxys, and
          support a prefix delegation/registration service for Clients.
          Proxy/Servers arrange to add their ADM-LLAs to the PRL maintained in
          a static map of Proxy/Server addresses for the link, the DNS
          resource records for the FQDN "linkupnetworks.[domainname]", etc.
          before entering service. The PRL should be arranged such that
          Clients can discover the addresses of Proxy/Servers that are
          geographically and/or topologically "close" to their underlying
          network connections.<a href="#section-3.12.3-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-2">When a Proxy/Server receives a prospective Client's RS message,
          it SHOULD return an immediate RA reply with Router Lifetime set to 0
          if it is currently too busy or otherwise unable to service the
          Client. Otherwise, the Proxy/Server performs OAL reassembly if
          necessary, then decapsulates and authenticates the RS message. If
          the RS message destination is link-scoped All-Routers multicast or
          the Proxy/Server's own ADM-LLA, the Proxy/Server assumes the Hub
          role. If the RS message destination is the ADM-LLA of another node,
          the Proxy/Server assumes the proxy role and forwards the RS to the
          Hub Proxy/server via the secured spanning tree. (An FHS Proxy/Server
          can also assume the proxy role when it receives an RS message
          addressed to link-scoped All-Routers multicast if it can determine
          the ADM-LLA of another Proxy/Server to serve as a Hub.)<a href="#section-3.12.3-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-3">The Hub Proxy/Server then determines the correct MNPs to provide
          to the Client by processing the MNP-LLA prefix parameters and/or the
          DHCPv6 OMNI sub-option. When the Hub Proxy/Server returns the MNPs,
          it also creates a forwarding table entry for the MNP-ULA
          corresponding to each MNP resulting in a BGP update (see: <a href="#scaling" class="xref">Section 3.2.3</a>). For IPv6, the Hub Proxy/Server creates an IPv6
          forwarding table entry for each MNP. For IPv4, the Hub Proxy/Server
          creates an IPv6 forwarding table entry with the IPv4-compatibility
          MNP-ULA prefix corresponding to the IPv4 address. The Hub
          Proxy/Server next creates a NCE for the Client using the base
          MNP-LLA as the network-layer address. Next, the Hub Proxy/Server
          updates the NCE by recording the information in the Interface
          Attributes sub-option in the RS OMNI option.<a href="#section-3.12.3-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-4">Next, the Hub Proxy/Server prepares an RA message using its
          ADM-LLA as the network-layer source address and the network-layer
          source address of the RS message as the network-layer destination
          address. The Hub Proxy/Server sets the Router Lifetime to the time
          for which it will maintain both this underlying interface
          individually and the NCE as a whole. The Hub Proxy/Server also sets
          Cur Hop Limit, M and O flags, Reachable Time and Retrans Timer to
          values appropriate for the OMNI link. The Hub Proxy/Server includes
          the MNPs, any other prefix management parameters and an OMNI option
          with the Interface Attributes sub-option echoed from the RS. The Hub
          Proxy/Server then includes one or more RIOs that encode the MSPs for
          the OMNI link, plus an MTU option (see <a href="#aeromtu" class="xref">Section 3.9</a>).
          The Hub Proxy/Server finally forwards the message using OAL
          encapsulation/fragmentation either via the FHS Proxy/Server over the
          secured spanning tree or directly to the Client.<a href="#section-3.12.3-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-5">After the initial RS/RA exchange, the Hub Proxy/Server maintains
          a ReachableTime timer for each of the Client's underlying interfaces
          individually (and for the Client's NCE collectively) set to expire
          after ReachableTime seconds. If the Client (or an FHS Proxy/Server)
          issues additional RS messages, the Hub Proxy/Server sends an RA
          response and resets ReachableTime. If the Hub Proxy/Server receives
          an IPv6 ND message with a prefix release indication it sets the
          Client's NCE to the DEPARTED state and withdraws the MNP from the
          routing system after a short delay (e.g., 2 seconds). If
          ReachableTime expires before a new RS is received on an individual
          underlying interface, the Hub Proxy/Server marks the interface as
          DOWN. If ReachableTime expires before any new RS is received on any
          individual underlying interface, the Hub Proxy/Server sets the NCE
          state to STALE and sets a 10 second timer. If the Hub Proxy/Server
          has not received a new RS or uNA message with a prefix release
          indication before the 10 second timer expires, it deletes the NCE
          and withdraws the MNP from the routing system.<a href="#section-3.12.3-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-6">The Hub Proxy/Server processes any IPv6 ND messages pertaining to
          the Client while forwarding to the Client or responding as
          necessary. The Hub Proxy/Server may also issue unsolicited RA
          messages, e.g., with reconfigure parameters to cause the Client to
          renegotiate its prefix delegation/registrations, with Router
          Lifetime set to 0 if it can no longer service this Client, etc.
          Finally, If the NCE is in the DEPARTED state, the Hub Proxy/Server
          deletes the entry after DepartTime expires. The Hub Proxy/Server may
          also receive carrier packets via the secured spanning tree that
          contain initial data packets sent while route optimization is in
          progress. The Hub Proxy/Server reassembles, then
          re-encapsulates/re-fragments and forwards the packets to the target
          Client via an FHS Proxy/Server if necessary.<a href="#section-3.12.3-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-7">Note: Clients SHOULD notify former Hub Proxy/Servers of their
          departures, but Hub Proxy/Servers are responsible for expiring
          neighbor cache entries and withdrawing routes even if no departure
          notification is received (e.g., if the Client leaves the network
          unexpectedly). Hub Proxy/Servers SHOULD therefore set Router
          Lifetime to ReachableTime seconds in solicited RA messages to
          minimize persistent stale cache information in the absence of Client
          departure notifications. A short Router Lifetime also ensures that
          proactive RS/RA messaging between Clients and FHS Proxy/Servers will
          keep any NAT state alive (see above).<a href="#section-3.12.3-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3-8">Note: All Proxy/Servers on an OMNI link MUST advertise consistent
          values in the RA Cur Hop Limit, M and O flags, Reachable Time and
          Retrans Timer fields the same as for any link, since unpredictable
          behavior could result if different Proxy/Servers on the same link
          advertised different values.<a href="#section-3.12.3-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

            </h5>
<p id="section-3.12.3.1-1">When a Client is not pre-provisioned with an MNP-LLA, it will
            need for the Hub Proxy/Server to select one or more MNPs on its
            behalf and set up the correct state in the AERO routing service.
            (A Client with a pre-provisioned MNP may also request the Hub
            Proxy/Server to select additional MNPs.) The DHCPv6 service <span>[<a href="#RFC8415" class="xref">RFC8415</a>]</span> is used to support this requirement.<a href="#section-3.12.3.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3.1-2">When a Client needs to have the Hub Proxy/Server select MNPs,
            it sends an RS message with source address set to the unspecified
            address (::) and with an OMNI option that includes a DHCPv6
            message sub-option with DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD)
            parameters. When the Hub Proxy/Server receives the RS message, it
            extracts the DHCPv6-PD message from the OMNI option.<a href="#section-3.12.3.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3.1-3">The Hub Proxy/Server then acts as a "Proxy DHCPv6 Client" in a
            message exchange with the locally-resident DHCPv6 server, which
            delegates MNPs and returns a DHCPv6-PD Reply message. (If the Hub
            Proxy/Server wishes to defer creation of MN state until the
            DHCPv6-PD Reply is received, it can instead act as a Lightweight
            DHCPv6 Relay Agent per <span>[<a href="#RFC6221" class="xref">RFC6221</a>]</span> by encapsulating
            the DHCPv6-PD message in a Relay-forward/reply exchange with Relay
            Message and Interface ID options.)<a href="#section-3.12.3.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3.1-4">When the Hub Proxy/Server receives the DHCPv6-PD Reply, it adds
            a route to the routing system and creates an MNP-LLA based on the
            delegated MNP. The Hub Proxy/Server then sends an RA back to the
            Client with the (newly-created) MNP-LLA as the destination address
            and with the DHCPv6-PD Reply message coded in the OMNI option.
            When the Client receives the RA, it creates a default route,
            assigns the Subnet Router Anycast address and sets its MNP-LLA
            based on the delegated MNP.<a href="#section-3.12.3.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.12.3.1-5">Note: See <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> for an MNP
            delegation alternative that avoids including a DHCPv6 message
            sub-option in the RS. Namely, when the Client requests a single
            MNP it can set the RS source to the unspecified address (::) and
            include a Node Identification sub-option and Preflen in the OMNI
            option (but with no DHCPv6 message sub-option). When the Hub
            Proxy/Server receives the RS message, it forwards a self-generated
            DHCPv6 Solicit message to the DHCPv6 server on behalf of the
            Client. When the Hub Proxy/Server receives the DHCPv6 Reply, it
            prepares an RA message with an OMNI option with Preflen
            information (but with no DHCPv6 message sub-option), then places
            the (newly-created) MNP-LLA in the RA destination address and
            returns the message to the Client.<a href="#section-3.12.3.1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3.13-1">OMNI link Clients register with FHS Proxy/Servers for each
        underlying interface. Each of the Client's FHS Proxy/Servers must
        inform a single Hub Proxy/Server of the Client's underlying
        interface(s) that it services. For Clients on Direct and VPNed
        underlying interfaces, the FHS Proxy/Server for each interface is
        directly connected, for Clients on ANET underlying interfaces the FHS
        Proxy/Server is located on the ANET/INET boundary, and for Clients on
        INET underlying interfaces the FHS Proxy/Server is located somewhere
        in the connected Internetwork. When FHS Proxy/Server "A" processes a
        Client registration, it must either assume the Hub role or forward a
        proxyed registration to another FHS Proxy/Server acting as the Hub.
        Proxy/Servers satisfy these requirements as follows:<a href="#section-3.13-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-3.13-2.1">when Proxy/Server "A" receives a Client RS message, it first
            verifies that the OAL Identification is within the window for the
            NCE that matches the MNP-ULA for this Client neighbor and
            authenticates the message. (If no NCE was found, Proxy/Server "A
            instead creates one in the STALE state and caches the
            Client-supplied Interface Attributes and Window Synchronization
            parameters as well as the Client's observed *NET addresses.)
            Proxy/Server "A" then examines the network-layer destination
            address. If the destination address is the ADM-LLA of a different
            Proxy/Server "B", Proxy/Server "A" prepares a separate proxyed
            version of the RS message with an OAL header with source set to
            its own ADM-ULA and destination set to Proxy/Server B's ADM-ULA.
            Proxy/Server "A" also writes its own information over the
            Interface Attributes sub-option supplied by the Client, then
            forwards the message into the OMNI link secured spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.13-2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.13-2.2">when Proxy/Server "B" receives the RS, it assume the Hub role
            and creates or updates a NCE for the Client with FHS Proxy/Server
            "A"'s Interface Attributes as the link-layer address information
            for this FHS omIndex. Hub Proxy/Server "B" then prepares an RA
            message with source set to its own LLA and destination set to the
            Client's MNP-LLA, then encapsulates the RA in an OAL header with
            source set to its own ADM-ULA and destination set to the ADM-ULA
            of FHS Proxy/Server "A". Hub Proxy/Server "B" then performs
            fragmentation if necessary and sends the resulting carrier packets
            into the secured spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.13-2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.13-2.3">when Proxy/Server "A" reassembles the RA, it locates the Client
            NCE based on the RA destination LLA. Proxy/Server "A" then
            re-encapsulates the RA message with OAL source set to its own
            ADM-ULA and OAL destination set to the MNP-ULA of the Client,
            includes an authentication signature if necessary and echoes the
            Client's Interface Attributes sub-option with the observed *NET
            addresses written over the L2ADDR while also supplying an
            Interface Attribues sub-option with omIndex '0' for its
            INET-facing interface. Proxy/Server "A" sets the P flag in the RA
            flags field to indicate that the message has passed through a
            proxy <span>[<a href="#RFC4389" class="xref">RFC4389</a>]</span>, includes responsive Window
            Synchronization parameters, then fragments the RA if necessary and
            returns the fragments to the Client.<a href="#section-3.13-2.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="section-3.13-2.4">The Client repeats this process over each of its additional
            underlying interfaces while treating each FHS Proxy/Server "C",
            "D", "E", etc. as a proxy to facilitate RS/RA exchanges between
            the Hub and the Client.<a href="#section-3.13-2.4" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
        </ul>
<p id="section-3.13-3">After the initial RS/RA exchanges each FHS Proxy/Server
        forwards any of the Client's carrier packets with OAL destinations for
        which there is no matching NCE to a Bridge using OAL encapsulation
        with its own ADM-ULA as the source and with destination determined by
        the Client. The Proxy/Server instead forwards any carrier packets
        destined to a neighbor cache target directly to the target according
        to the OAL/link-layer information - the process of establishing
        neighbor cache entries is specified in <a href="#predirect" class="xref">Section 3.14</a>.<a href="#section-3.13-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-4">While the Client is still associated with each FHS Proxy/Server
        "A", "A" can send NS, RS and/or unsolicited NA messages to update the
        neighbor cache entries of other AERO nodes on behalf of the Client
        and/or to convey Interface Attribute updates. This allows for
        higher-frequency Proxy-initiated RS/RA messaging over well-connected
        INET infrastructure supplemented by lower-frequency Client-initiated
        RS/RA messaging over constrained ANET data links.<a href="#section-3.13-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-5">If the Hub Proxy/Server "A" ceases to send solicited RAs,
        Proxy/Servers "B", "C", "D" send unsolicited RAs over the Client's
        underlying interface with destination set to (link-local) All-Nodes
        multicast and with Router Lifetime set to zero to inform Clients that
        the Hub Proxy/Server has failed. Although Proxy/Servers "B", "C" and
        "D" can engage in IPv6 ND exchanges on behalf of the Client, the
        Client can also send IPv6 ND messages on its own behalf, e.g., if it
        is in a better position to convey state changes. The IPv6 ND messages
        sent by the Client include the Client's MNP-LLA as the source in order
        to differentiate them from the IPv6 ND messages sent by Proxy/Server
        "A".<a href="#section-3.13-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-6">If the Client becomes unreachable over all underlying interface it
        serves, the Hub Proxy/Server sets the NCE state to DEPARTED and
        retains the entry for DepartTime seconds. While the state is DEPARTED,
        the Hub Proxy/Server forwards any carrier packets destined to the
        Client to a Bridge via OAL encapsulation. When DepartTime expires, the
        Hub Proxy/Server deletes the NCE and discards any further carrier
        packets destined to the former Client.<a href="#section-3.13-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-7">In some ANETs that employ a Proxy/Server, the Client's MNP can be
        injected into the ANET routing system. In that case, the Client can
        send original IP packets without invoking the OAL so that the ANET
        routing system transports the original IP packets to the Proxy. This
        can be very beneficial, e.g., if the Client connects to the ANET via
        low-end data links such as some aviation wireless links.<a href="#section-3.13-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-8">If the ANET first-hop access router is on the same underlying link
        as the Client and recognizes the AERO/OMNI protocol, the Client can
        avoid OAL encapsulation for both its control and data messages. When
        the Client connects to the link, it can send an unencapsulated RS
        message with source address set to its own MNP-LLA (or to a Temporary
        LLA), and with destination address set to the ADM-LLA of the Client's
        selected Proxy/Server or to link-scoped All-Routers multicast. The
        Client includes an OMNI option formatted as specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>. The Client then sends the
        unencapsulated RS message, which will be intercepted by the AERO-Aware
        access router.<a href="#section-3.13-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-9">The ANET access router then performs OAL encapsulation on the RS
        message and forwards it to a Proxy/Server at the ANET/INET boundary.
        When the access router and Proxy/Server are one and the same node, the
        Proxy/Server would share and underlying link with the Client but its
        message exchanges with outside correspondents would need to pass
        through a security gateway at the ANET/INET border. The method for
        deploying access routers and Proxys (i.e. as a single node or multiple
        nodes) is an ANET-local administrative consideration.<a href="#section-3.13-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-10">Note: When a Proxy/Server alters the IPv6 ND message contents
        before forwarding (e.g., such as altering the OMNI option contents),
        the IPv6 ND message checksum and/or authentication signature are
        invalidated. If the Proxy/Server forwards the message over the secured
        spanning tree, however, it need not re-calculate the
        checksum/signature since they will not be examined by the next
        hop.<a href="#section-3.13-10" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13-11">Note: When a Proxy/Server receives a secured Client NS message, it
        performs the same proxying procedures as for described for RS messages
        above. The proxying procedures for NS/NA message exchanges is
        specified in <a href="#predirect" class="xref">Section 3.14</a>.<a href="#section-3.13-11" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          (i.e., and not low-end aeronautical radio links) and can therefore
          be tuned for rapid response.<a href="#section-3.13.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13.1-2">FHS Proxy/Servers perform continuous NS/NA(NUD) exchanges with
          the Hub Proxy/Server in rapid succession, e.g., one exchange per
          second. The FHS Proxy/Server sends the NS(NUD) message via the
          spanning tree with its own ADM-LLA as the source and the ADM-LLA of
          the Hub Proxy/Server as the destination, and the Hub Proxy/Server
          responds with an NA(NUD). When the FHS Proxy/Server is also sending
          RS messages to a Hub Proxy/Server on behalf of Clients, the
          resulting RA responses can be considered as equivalent hints of
          forward progress. This means that the FHS Proxy/Server need not also
          send a periodic NS(NUD) if it has already sent an RS within the same
          period. If the Hub Proxy/Server fails (i.e., if the FHS Proxy/Server
          ceases to receive advertisements), the FHS Proxy/Server can quickly
          inform Clients by sending unsolicited RA messages<a href="#section-3.13.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.13.1-3">The FHS Proxy/Server sends unsolicited RA messages with source
          address set to the Hub Proxy/Server's address, destination address
          set to (link-local) All-Nodes multicast, and Router Lifetime set to
          0. The FHS Proxy/Server SHOULD send MAX_FINAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS RA
          messages separated by small delays <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>. Any
          Clients that had been using the failed Hub Proxy/Server will receive
          the RA messages and select one of its other FHS Proxy/Servers to

          exchange applies for all interfaces regardless of the specific
          interface used to conduct the exchange. However, the window
          synchronization exchange only confirms target Client reachability
          over the specific underlying interface pair. Reachability for other
          underlying interfaces that share the same window synchronization

<p id="section-3.14.7-1">When the ROR receives an NS(AR) with a full contingency of
          Interface Attributes, it can perform "rapid commit" by immediately
          invoking Multilink Forwarding the same as specified in <a href="#postro" class="xref">Section 3.14.6</a> instead of returning an NA(AR). In order to
          perform rapid commit, the ROR prepares an NS message with an OMNI
          option with Window Synchronization information responsive to the
          NS(AR), with all of the ROR's Interface Attributes and with a
          Multilink Forwarding Parameters sub-option selected for a specific
          underlying interface pair. The ROR can also include ordinary IP
          packets as OAL super-packet trailers to the NS message if it has
          immediate data to send to the ROS. The ROR then returns the NS to
          the ROS the same as for the NA(AR) case.<a href="#section-3.14.7-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.14.7-2">When the NS message traverses the return path to the ROR, all
          intermediate nodes in the path establish state exactly the same as
          for an ordinary NS/NA route optimization exchange. When the NS
          message arrives at the ROS, the Window Synchronization parameters
          confirm that the NS is taking the place of the NA(AR), thereby
          saving a round trip and eliminating an extraneous message. The ROS
          then completes the route optimization by returning a responsive

<p id="section-3.15-1">AERO nodes perform Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) per
        <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span> either reactively in response to persistent
        link-layer errors (see <a href="#aeroerr" class="xref">Section 3.11</a>) or proactively to
        confirm reachability. The NUD algorithm is based on periodic control
        message exchanges and may further be seeded by IPv6 ND hints of
        forward progress, but care must be taken to avoid inferring
        reachability based on spoofed information. For example, IPv6 ND
        message exchanges that include authentication codes and/or in-window
        Identifications may be considered as acceptable hints of forward
        progress, while spurious random carrier packets should be ignored.<a href="#section-3.15-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.15-2">AERO nodes can perform NS/NA(NUD) exchanges over the OMNI link
        secured spanning tree (i.e. the same as described above) to test
        reachability without risk of DoS attacks from nodes pretending to be a
        neighbor. These NS/NA(NUD) messages use the unicast LLAs and ULAs of
        the parties involved in the NUD test. When only reachability
        information is required without updating any other NCE state, AERO
        nodes can instead perform NS/NA(NUD) exchanges directly between
        neighbors without employing the secured spanning tree as long as they
        include in-window Identifications and either an authentication
        signature or checksum.<a href="#section-3.15-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.15-3">When an ROR directs an ROS to a target neighbor with one or more
        link-layer addresses, the ROS probes each unsecured target underlying
        interface either proactively or on-demand of carrier packets directed
        to the path by multilink forwarding to maintain the interface's state
        as reachable. Probing is performed through NS(NUD) messages over the
        SRT secured or unsecured spanning tree, or through NS(NUD) messages
        sent directly to an underlying interface of the target itself. While
        testing a target underlying interface, the ROS can optionally continue
        to forward carrier packets via alternate interfaces, maintain a small
        queue of carrier packets until target reachability is confirmed or
        optimistically include them as trailing data with the NS(NUD) in an
        OAL super-packet <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3.15-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.15-4">NS(NUD) messages are encapsulated, fragmented and transmitted as
        carrier packets the same as for ordinary original IP data packets,
        however the encapsulated destinations are the LLA of the ROS and
        either the ADM-LLA of the LHS Proxy/Server or the MNP-LLA of the
        target itself. The ROS encapsulates the NS(NUD) message the same as
        described in <a href="#segspan" class="xref">Section 3.2.7</a> and includes an Interface
        Attributes sub-option with omIndex set to identify the underlying
        interface used for forwarding (or to 0 if any underlying interface can
        be used). The ROS then fragments the OAL packet and forwards the
        resulting carrier packets into the unsecured spanning tree or via
        direct encapsulation for local segment targets.<a href="#section-3.15-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.15-5">When the target receives the NS(NUD) carrier packets, it verifies
        that it has a NCE for this ROS and that the Identification is
        in-window, then submits the carrier packets for reassembly. The target
        then verifies the authentication signature or checksum, then searches
        for Interface Attributes in its NCE for the ROS that match the NS(NUD)
        for the NA(NUD) reply. The node then prepares the NA(NUD) with the
        source and destination LLAs reversed, encapsulates and sets the OAL
        source and destination, includes an Interface Attributes sub-option in
        the NA(NUD) to identify the omIndex of the underlying interface the
        NS(NUD) arrived on and sets the Target Address to the same value
        included in the NS(NUD). The target next sets the R flag to 1, the S
        flag to 1 and the O flag to 1, then selects an in-window
        Identification for the ROS and performs fragmentation. The node then
        forwards the carrier packets into the unsecured spanning tree,
        directly to the ROS if it is in the local segment or directly to a
        Bridge in the local segment.<a href="#section-3.15-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.15-6">When the ROS receives the NA(NUD), it marks the target underlying
        interface tested as "reachable". Note that underlying interface states
        are maintained independently of the overall NCE REACHABLE state, and
        that a single NCE may have multiple target underlying interfaces in
        various states "reachable" and otherwise while the NCE state as a
        whole remains REACHABLE.<a href="#section-3.15-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.15-7">Note also that the exchange of NS/NA(NUD) messages has the useful
        side-benefit of opening holes in NATs that may be useful for NAT
        traversal. For example, a Client that discovers the address of a
        Bridge on the local SRT segment during an NS/NA exchange with a peer
        that established MFIB state can send an NS(NUD) message directly to
        the INET address of the Bridge while including an authentication
        signature. The NS(NUD) will open a hole in any NATs on the path from
        the Client to the Bridge, and the Bridge can verify the authentication
        signature before returning a direct NA(NUD) to the Client's NATed
        L2ADDR while also including an authentication signature. Future
        carrier packets exchanged between the Client and peer can then be
        forwarded directly via the Bridge while bypassing the Client's FHS
        Proxy/Server.<a href="#section-3.15-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        OMNI link, as opposed to a Centralized Mobility Management (CMM)
        service where there is a single network mobility collective entity for
        all Clients. Clients coordinate with their associated FHS and Hub
        Proxy/Servers via RS/RA exchanges to maintain the DMM profile, and the

<p id="section-3.16-2">Hub Proxy/Servers provide a designated router service for their

        maintaining neighbor relationships with their Proxy/Servers through
        periodic RS/RA exchanges, which also serves to confirm neighbor
        reachability. When a Client's underlying interface attributes change,
        the Client is responsible for updating the Hub Proxy/Server through
        new RS/RA exchanges using the FHS Proxy/Server as a first-hop conduit.
        The FHS Proxy/Server can also act as a proxy to perform some IPv6 ND

<p id="section-3.16.1-1">RORs and ROSs accommodate Client mobility and/or multilink change
          events by sending secured uNA messages to each active neighbor. When
          an ROR/ROS sends a uNA message, it sets the IPv6 source address to
          the its own LLA, sets the destination address to the neighbor's
          {ADM,MNP}-LLA and sets the Target Address to the Client's MNP-LLA.
          The ROR/ROS also includes an OMNI option with Preflen set to the
          prefix length associated with the Client's MNP-LLA, includes
          Interface Attributes and Traffic Selectors for the Client's
          underlying interfaces and includes an authentication signature if
          necessary. The ROR then sets the uNA R flag to 1, S flag to 0 and O
          flag to 1, then encapsulates the message in an OAL header with
          source set to its own ULA and destination set to its FHS
          Proxy/Server's ADM-ULA. When the FHS Proxy/Server receives the uNA,
          it reassembles, verifies the authentication signature, then changes
          the destination to the Hub Proxy/Server's ADM-ULA. When the Hub
          Proxy/Server receives the uNA, it checks the Interface Attributes
          for consistency then changes the destination to the ULA
          corresponding to the LLA destination and forwards the uNA into the
          secured spanning tree.<a href="#section-3.16.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.16.1-2">As discussed in Section 7.2.6 of <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>, the
          transmission and reception of uNA messages is unreliable but
          provides a useful optimization. In well-connected Internetworks with
          robust data links uNA messages will be delivered with high
          probability, but in any case the ROR/ROS can optionally send up to
          MAX_NEIGHBOR_ADVERTISEMENT uNAs to each neighbor to increase the
          likelihood that at least one will be received. Alternatively, the
          ROR/ROS can set the PNG flag in the uNA OMNI option header to
          request a solicited NA acknowledgement as specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3.16.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.16.1-3">When the ROR/ROS Proxy/Server receives a uNA message prepared as
          above, if the uNA destination was its own ADM-LLA the Proxy/Server
          uses the included OMNI option information to update its NCE for the
          target but does not reset ReachableTime since the receipt of a uNA
          message does not provide confirmation that any forward paths to the
          target Client are working. If the destination was the MNP-LLA of the
          ROR/ROS Client, the Proxy/Server instead re-encapsulates with the
          OAL source set to its own ADM-ULA, OAL destination set to the
          MNP-ULA of the ROR/ROS Client with an authentication signature if
          necessary, and with an in-window Identification for this Client.
          Finally, if the uNA message PNG flag was set, the node that
          processes the uNA returns a solicited NA acknowledgement as
          specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3.16.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.16.1-4">In addition to sending uNA messages to the current set of
          RORs/ROSs for the target Client, source Clients also send uNAs to
          the former Proxy/Server associated with the underlying interface for
          which the link-layer address has changed. These uNA messages update
          former Proxy/Servers that cannot easily detect (e.g., without active
          probing) when a formerly-active Client has departed. When the
          ROR/ROS sends the uNA, it sets the source address to its LLA, sets
          the destination address to the former Proxy/Server's ADM-LLA, and
          sets the Target Address to the Client's MNP-LLA. The ROR/ROS also
          includes an OMNI option with Preflen set to the prefix length
          associated with the Client's MNP-LLA and with Interface Attributes
          for the changed underlying interface. The ROR then sets the uNA R
          flag to 1, S flag to 0 and O flag to 1, then encapsulates the
          message in an OAL header with source set to its own ADM-ULA and

<p id="section-3.17-2">Clients on VPNed, Direct or ANET underlying interfaces for which

          solicited node multicast address corresponding to S as the
          destination and the LLA of S as the target address. X then
          encapsulates the NS(AR) in an OAL header with source address set to

          behind any Proxys "Z"*, each Z* then updates its MRIB accordingly
          and maintains the LLA of X as the next hop in the reverse path.
          Since Bridges forward messages not addressed to themselves without
          examining them, this means that the (reverse) multicast tree path is
          simply from each Z* (and/or S) to X with no other multicast-aware

        'omni1' for the second, 'omni2' for the third, etc. Each OMNI link

<p id="section-3.18-4">In a first alternative, if each OMNI link services different MSPs

        then perform Segment Routing to select the correct SRT, which will

        Proxy/Server in a "tethered" arrangement with all of the Client's
        traffic transiting the Proxy/Server which acts as a router.
        Alternatively, the Client can associate with an INET FHS/Hub
        Proxy/Server using UDP/IP encapsulation and control message securing
        services as discussed in the following sections.<a href="#section-3.22-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-2">When a Client's OMNI interface enables an INET underlying
        interface, it first examines the INET address. For IPv4, the Client
        assumes it is on the open Internet if the INET address is not a
        special-use IPv4 address per <span>[<a href="#RFC3330" class="xref">RFC3330</a>]</span>. Similarly for

        Otherwise, the Client should assume it is behind one or several
        NATs.<a href="#section-3.22-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-3">The Client then prepares an RS message with IPv6 source address set
        to its MNP-LLA, with IPv6 destination set to link-scoped All-Routers
        multicast and with an OMNI option with underlying interface
        attributes. If the Client believes that it is on the open Internet, it
        SHOULD include its IP address and UDP port number in the Multilink
        Forwarding Parameters sub-option corresponding to the underlying
        interface. The Client includes the Port Number and IP address written
        in obfuscated form <span>[<a href="#RFC4380" class="xref">RFC4380</a>]</span> and as discussed in <a href="#interface" class="xref">Section 3.3</a>. The Client finally includes an authentication
        signature per <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> to provide
        message authentication, selects an Identification value and window
        synchronization parameters, and submits the RS for OAL encapsulation.
        The Client then encapsulates the OAL atomic fragment in UDP/IP headers
        to form a carrier packet, sets the UDP/IP source to its INET address
        and UDP port, sets the UDP/IP destination to the FHS Proxy/Server's
        INET address and the AERO service port number (8060), then sends the

<p id="section-3.22-4">When the FHS Proxy/Server receives the RS, it discards the OAL
        encapsulation, authenticates the RS message, and examines the
        destination address. If the Multilink Forwarding Parameters sub-option
        includes a non-zero L2ADDR, the FHS Proxy/Server compares the
        encapsulation IP address and UDP port number with the (unobfuscated)
        values. If the values are the same, the FHS Proxy/Server caches the
        Client's information as an "INET" address meaning that the Client is
        likely to accept direct messages without requiring NAT traversal
        exchanges. If the values are different (or, if the Multilink
        Forwarding Parameters did not include a non-zero L2ADDR) the Hub
        Proxy/Server instead caches the Client's information as a "mapped"
        address meaning that NAT traversal exchanges may be necessary. The FHS
        Proxy/Server then rewrites the Client' information to the observed
        addresses on the INET.<a href="#section-3.22-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-5">If the destination is the ADM-LLA of another Proxy/Server, the FHS
        Proxy/Server then assumes the proxy role and forwards the message into
        the secured spanning tree. If the destination is its own ADM-LLA, the
        FHS Proxy/Server instead assumes the Hub role, creates a NCE and
        registers the Client's MNP, window synchronization state and INET
        interface information according to the OMNI option parameters. (If the
        destination is link-scoped All-Routers multicast, the FHS Proxy/Server
        can assume either the proxy or Hub role.) The Hub Proxy/Server then
        prepares an RA message with IPv6 source and destination set
        corresponding to the addresses in the RS, and with an OMNI option that
        includes a Multilink Forwarding Parameters sub-option, an

        information if necessary. The Hub Proxy/Server then performs OAL
        encapsulation then encapsulates the carrier packet in UDP/IP headers

        Client.<a href="#section-3.22-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        same, the Client assumes the open Internet / Cone NAT principle; if
        the addresses are different, the Client instead assumes that further
        qualification procedures are necessary to detect the type of NAT and
        performs NAT traversal on-demand according to standard procedures
        <span>[<a href="#RFC6081" class="xref">RFC6081</a>]</span><span>[<a href="#RFC4380" class="xref">RFC4380</a>]</span>. The Client also
        caches the rest of the RA Multilink Forwarding Parameters information
        to discover the FHS Proxy/Server's local spanning tree segment as well
        as the LHS information for the Hub. The Client finally arranges to
        return an explicit/implicit acknowledgement, and sends periodic RS
        messages to receive fresh RA messages before the Router Lifetime
        received on each INET interface expires.<a href="#section-3.22-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-7">When the Client sends messages to target IP addresses, it also
        invokes route optimization per <a href="#predirect" class="xref">Section 3.14</a>. For route
        optimized targets in the same OMNI link segment, if the target's
        L2ADDR is on the open INET, the Client forwards carrier packets
        directly to the target INET address. If the target is behind a NAT,
        the Client first establishes NAT state for the L2ADDR using the
        "direct bubble" and NS/NA(NUD) mechanisms discussed in <a href="#cforw" class="xref">Section 3.10.1</a>. The Client continues to send carrier packets via the
        local Bridge discovered during window synchronization until NAT state
        is populated, then begins forwarding carrier packets via the direct
        path through the NAT to the target. For targets in different OMNI link
        segments, the Client forwards carrier packets to the local Bridge.<a href="#section-3.22-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-8">The Client can send original IP packets to route-optimized
        neighbors in the same OMNI link segment no larger than the
        minimum/path MPS in one piece and with OAL encapsulation as atomic
        fragments. For larger original IP packets, the Client applies OAL
        encapsulation then fragments if necessary according to <a href="#aeromtu" class="xref">Section 3.9</a>, with OAL header with source set to its own MNP-ULA
        and destination set to the MNP-ULA of the target, and with an
        in-window Identification value. The Client then encapsulates each
        resulting carrier packet in UDP/IP *NET headers and sends them to the
        neighbor.<a href="#section-3.22-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-9">INET Clients exchange NS/NA messages to enable multilink forwarding
        with a peer via a specific underlying interface pair as discussed in
        <a href="#segspan" class="xref">Section 3.2.7</a>. The exchange establishes MFIB state in the
        Client, peer and all OMNI intermediate nodes in the path. After MFIB
        state is established, INET Clients and peers can exchange carrier
        packets with compressed headers that include an MFVI which is updated
        on a hop-by-hop basis, while employing "shortcuts" to skip any
        unnecessary hops.<a href="#section-3.22-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.22-10">Note: The NAT traversal procedures specified in this document are
        applicable for Cone, Address-Restricted and Port-Restricted NATs only.
        While future updates to this document may specify procedures for other
        NAT variations (e.g., hairpinning and various forms of Symmetric
        NATs), it should be noted that continuous communications are always
        possible through Proxy/Server forwarding even for these other NAT
        variations.<a href="#section-3.22-10" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-3.23-1">In some use cases, it is desirable, beneficial and efficient for
        the Client to receive a constant MNP that travels with the Client
        wherever it moves. For example, this would allow air traffic
        controllers to easily track aircraft, etc. In other cases, however
        (e.g., intelligent transportation systems), the MN may be willing to
        sacrifice a modicum of efficiency in order to have time-varying MNPs
        that can be changed every so often to defeat adversarial tracking.<a href="#section-3.23-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.23-2">The DHCPv6 service offers a way for Clients that desire
        time-varying MNPs to obtain short-lived prefixes (e.g., on the order
        of a small number of minutes). In that case, the identity of the
        Client would not be bound to the MNP but rather to a Node
        Identification value (see: <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>) to
        be used as the Client ID seed for MNP prefix delegation. The Client
        would then be obligated to renumber its internal networks whenever its
        MNP (and therefore also its MNP-LLA) changes. This should not present
        a challenge for Clients with automated network renumbering services,
        however presents limits for the durations of ongoing sessions that
        would prefer to use a constant address.<a href="#section-3.23-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

      </h2>
<p id="section-6-1">AERO Bridges configure secured tunnels with AERO Proxy/Servers and
      Relays within their local OMNI link segments. Applicable secured tunnel
      alternatives include IPsec <span>[<a href="#RFC4301" class="xref">RFC4301</a>]</span>, TLS/SSL <span>[<a href="#RFC8446" class="xref">RFC8446</a>]</span>, DTLS <span>[<a href="#RFC6347" class="xref">RFC6347</a>]</span>, WireGuard <span>[<a href="#WG" class="xref">WG</a>]</span>, etc. The AERO Bridges of all OMNI link segments in turn
      configure secured tunnels for their neighboring AERO Bridges in a
      secured spanning tree topology. Therefore, control messages exchanged
      between any pair of OMNI link neighbors over the secured spanning tree
      are already protected.<a href="#section-6-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-2">To prevent spoofing vectors, Proxy/Servers MUST discard without
      responding to any unsecured NS/NA(AR) messages. Also, Proxy/Servers MUST
      discard without forwarding any original IP packets received from one of
      their own Clients (whether directly or following OAL reassembly) with a
      source address that does not match the Client's MNP and/or a destination
      address that does match the Client's MNP. Finally, Proxy/Servers MUST
      discard without forwarding any carrier packets with an OAL source and
      destination that both match the same MNP.<a href="#section-6-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-3">For INET partitions that require strong security in the data plane,
      two options for securing communications include 1) disable route
      optimization so that all traffic is conveyed over secured tunnels, or 2)
      enable on-demand secure tunnel creation between Client neighbors. Option
      1) would result in longer routes than necessary and impose traffic
      concentration on critical infrastructure elements. Option 2) could be
      coordinated between Clients using NS/NA messages with OMNI Host Identity
      Protocol (HIP) "Initiator/Responder" message sub-options <span>[<a href="#RFC7401" class="xref">RFC7401</a>]</span><span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span> to create a

<p id="section-6-4">AERO Clients that connect to secured ANETs need not apply security to
      their IPv6 ND messages, since the messages will be authenticated and
      forwarded by a perimeter Proxy/Server that applies security on its
      INET-facing interface as part of the spanning tree (see above). AERO
      Clients connected to the open INET can use network and/or transport
      layer security services such as VPNs or can by some other means
      establish a direct link to a Proxy/Server. When a VPN or direct link may
      be impractical, however, INET Clients and Proxy/Servers SHOULD include
      and verify authentication signatures for their IPv6 ND messages as
      specified in <span>[<a href="#I-D.templin-6man-omni" class="xref">I-D.templin-6man-omni</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-6-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-5">Application endpoints SHOULD use transport-layer (or higher-layer)
      security services such as QUIC-TLS, TLS/SSL, DTLS or SSH <span>[<a href="#RFC4251" class="xref">RFC4251</a>]</span> to assure the same level of protection as for
      critical secured Internet services. AERO Clients that require host-based
      VPN services SHOULD use network and/or transport layer security services
      such as IPsec, TLS/SSL, DTLS, etc. AERO Proxys and Proxy/Servers can
      also provide a network-based VPN service on behalf of the Client, e.g.,
      if the Client is located within a secured enclave and cannot establish a
      VPN on its own behalf.<a href="#section-6-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-6">AERO Proxy/Servers and Bridges present targets for traffic
      amplification Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This concern is no
      different than for widely-deployed VPN security gateways in the
      Internet, where attackers could send spoofed packets to the gateways at
      high data rates. This can be mitigated through the AERO/OMNI data origin
      authentication procedures, as well as connecting Proxy/Servers and
      Bridges over dedicated links with no connections to the Internet and/or
      when connections to the Internet are only permitted through well-managed
      firewalls. Traffic amplification DoS attacks can also target an AERO
      Client's low data rate links. This is a concern not only for Clients
      located on the open Internet but also for Clients in secured enclaves.
      AERO Proxy/Servers and Proxys can institute rate limits that protect
      Clients from receiving packet floods that could DoS low data rate
      links.<a href="#section-6-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-7">AERO Relays must implement ingress filtering to avoid a spoofing
      attack in which spurious messages with ULA addresses are injected into
      an OMNI link from an outside attacker. AERO Clients MUST ensure that
      their connectivity is not used by unauthorized nodes on their EUNs to
      gain access to a protected network, i.e., AERO Clients that act as
      routers MUST NOT provide routing services for unauthorized nodes. (This
      concern is no different than for ordinary hosts that receive an IP
      address delegation but then "share" the address with other nodes via
      some form of Internet connection sharing such as tethering.)<a href="#section-6-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-8">The PRL MUST be well-managed and secured from unauthorized tampering,
      even though the list contains only public information. The PRL can be
      conveyed to the Client in a similar fashion as in <span>[<a href="#RFC5214" class="xref">RFC5214</a>]</span> (e.g., through layer 2 data link login messaging,
      secure upload of a static file, DNS lookups, etc.).<a href="#section-6-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-9">The AERO service for open INET Clients depends on a public key
      distribution service in which Client public keys and identities are
      maintained in a shared database accessible to all open INET
      Proxy/Servers. Similarly, each Client must be able to determine the
      public key of each Proxy/Server, e.g. by consulting an online database.
      When AERO nodes register their public keys indexed by a unique Host
      Identity Tag (HIT) <span>[<a href="#RFC7401" class="xref">RFC7401</a>]</span> in a distributed database
      such as the DNS, and use the HIT as an identity for applying IPv6 ND

      attestation is available.<a href="#section-6-9" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-7-3">This work was inspired by the support and encouragement of countless
      outstanding colleagues, managers and program directors over the span of
      many decades. Beginning in the late 1980s,' the Digital Equipment
      Corporation (DEC) Ultrix Engineering and DECnet Architects groups
      identified early issues with fragmentation and bridging links with
      diverse MTUs. In the early 1990s, engagements at DEC Project Sequoia at
      UC Berkeley and the DEC Western Research Lab in Palo Alto included
      investigations into large-scale networked filesystems, ATM vs Internet
      and network security proxys. In the mid-1990s to early 2000s employment
      at the NASA Ames Research Center (Sterling Software) and SRI
      International supported early investigations of IPv6, ONR UAV
      Communications and the IETF. An employment at Nokia where important IETF
      documents were published gave way to a present-day engagement with The
      Boeing Company. The work matured at Boeing through major programs
      including Future Combat Systems, Advanced Airplane Program, DTN for the
      International Space Station, Mobility Vision Lab, CAST, Caravan,
      Airplane Internet of Things, the NASA UAS/CNS program, the FAA/ICAO
      ATN/IPS program and many others. An attempt to name all who gave support

      </h2>
<p id="appendix-A-1">AERO can be applied to a multitude of Internetworking scenarios, with
      each having its own adaptations. The following considerations are
      provided as non-normative guidance:<a href="#appendix-A-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.1-1">Route optimization as discussed in <a href="#predirect" class="xref">Section 3.14</a>
        results in the creation of NCEs. The NCE state is set to REACHABLE for
        at most ReachableTime seconds. In order to refresh the NCE lifetime
        before the ReachableTime timer expires, the specification requires
        implementations to issue a new NS/NA(AR) exchange to reset
        ReachableTime while data packets are still flowing. However, the
        decision of when to initiate a new NS/NA(AR) exchange and to
        perpetuate the process is left as an implementation detail.<a href="#appendix-A.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.1-2">One possible strategy may be to monitor the NCE watching for data
        packets for (ReachableTime - 5) seconds. If any data packets have been
        sent to the neighbor within this timeframe, then send an NS(AR) to
        receive a new NA(AR). If no data packets have been sent, wait for 5
        additional seconds and send an immediate NS(AR) if any data packets
        are sent within this "expiration pending" 5 second window. If no
        additional data packets are sent within the 5 second window, reset the
        NCE state to STALE.<a href="#appendix-A.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.1-3">The monitoring of the neighbor data packet traffic therefore
        becomes an ongoing process during the NCE lifetime. If the NCE
        expires, future data packets will trigger a new NS/NA(AR) exchange
        while the packets themselves are delivered over a longer path until
        route optimization state is re-established.<a href="#appendix-A.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.2-1">OMNI interface neighbors MAY provide a configuration option that
        allows them to perform implicit mobility management in which no IPv6
        ND messaging is used. In that case, the Client only transmits packets
        over a single interface at a time, and the neighbor always observes
        packets arriving from the Client from the same link-layer source
        address.<a href="#appendix-A.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.2-2">If the Client's underlying interface address changes (either due to
        a readdressing of the original interface or switching to a new
        interface) the neighbor immediately updates the NCE for the Client and
        begins accepting and sending packets according to the Client's new
        address. This implicit mobility method applies to use cases such as
        cellphones with both WiFi and Cellular interfaces where only one of
        the interfaces is active at a given time, and the Client automatically
        switches over to the backup interface if the primary interface
        fails.<a href="#appendix-A.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.3-1">When a Client's OMNI interface is configured over a Direct
        interface, the neighbor at the other end of the Direct link can
        receive packets without any encapsulation. In that case, the Client
        sends packets over the Direct link according to traffic selectors. If
        the Direct interface is selected, then the Client's IP packets are
        transmitted directly to the peer without going through an ANET/INET.
        If other interfaces are selected, then the Client's IP packets are
        transmitted via a different interface, which may result in the
        inclusion of Proxy/Servers and Bridges in the communications path.
        Direct interfaces must be tested periodically for reachability, e.g.,
        via NUD.<a href="#appendix-A.3-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.4-1">AERO Bridges can be either Commercial off-the Shelf (COTS) standard
        IP routers or virtual machines in the cloud. Bridges must be
        provisioned, supported and managed by the INET administrative
        authority, and connected to the Bridges of other INETs via
        inter-domain peerings. Cost for purchasing, configuring and managing
        Bridges is nominal even for very large OMNI links.<a href="#appendix-A.4-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.4-2">AERO INET Proxy/Servers can be standard dedicated server platforms,
        but most often will be deployed as virtual machines in the cloud. The
        only requirements for INET Proxy/Servers are that they can run the
        AERO/OMNI code and have at least one network interface connection to
        the INET. INET Proxy/Servers must be provisioned, supported and
        managed by the INET administrative authority. Cost for purchasing,
        configuring and managing cloud Proxy/Servers is nominal especially for
        virtual machines.<a href="#appendix-A.4-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.4-3">AERO ANET Proxy/Servers are most often standard dedicated server
        platforms with one underlying interface connected to the ANET and a
        second interface connected to an INET. As with INET Proxy/Servers, the
        only requirements are that they can run the AERO/OMNI code and have at
        least one interface connection to the INET. ANET Proxy/Servers must be
        provisioned, supported and managed by the ANET administrative
        authority. Cost for purchasing, configuring and managing Proxys is
        nominal, and borne by the ANET administrative authority.<a href="#appendix-A.4-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.4-4">AERO Relays are simply Proxy/Servers connected to INETs and/or EUNs
        that provide forwarding services for non-MNP destinations. The Relay
        connects to the OMNI link and engages in eBGP peering with one or more
        Bridges as a stub AS. The Relay then injects its MNPs and/or non-MNP
        prefixes into the BGP routing system, and provisions the prefixes to
        its downstream-attached networks. The Relay can perform ROS/ROR
        services the same as for any Proxy/Server, and can route between the
        MNP and non-MNP address spaces.<a href="#appendix-A.4-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.5-1">AERO Proxy/Servers may appear as a single point of failure in the
        architecture, but such is not the case since all Proxy/Servers on the
        link provide identical services and loss of a Proxy/Server does not
        imply immediate and/or comprehensive communication failures.
        Proxy/Server failure is quickly detected and conveyed by Bidirectional
        Forward Detection (BFD) and/or proactive NUD allowing Clients to
        migrate to new Proxy/Servers.<a href="#appendix-A.5-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.5-2">If a Proxy/Server fails, ongoing packet forwarding to Clients will
        continue by virtue of the neighbor cache entries that have already
        been established in route optimization sources (ROSs). If a Client
        also experiences mobility events at roughly the same time the
        Proxy/Server fails, uNA messages may be lost but neighbor cache
        entries in the DEPARTED state will ensure that packet forwarding to
        the Client's new locations will continue for up to DepartTime
        seconds.<a href="#appendix-A.5-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.5-3">If a Client is left without a Proxy/Server for a considerable
        length of time (e.g., greater than ReachableTime seconds) then
        existing neighbor cache entries will eventually expire and both
        ongoing and new communications will fail. The original source will
        continue to retransmit until the Client has established a new
        Proxy/Server relationship, after which time continuous communications
        will resume.<a href="#appendix-A.5-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.5-4">Therefore, providing many Proxy/Servers on the link with high
        availability profiles provides resilience against loss of individual
        Proxy/Servers and assurance that Clients can establish new
        Proxy/Server relationships quickly in event of a Proxy/Server
        failure.<a href="#appendix-A.5-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.6-1">The AERO architectural model is client / server in the control
        plane, with route optimization in the data plane. The same as for
        common Internet services, the AERO Client discovers the addresses of
        AERO Proxy/Servers and connects to one or more of them. The AERO
        service is analogous to common Internet services such as google.com,
        yahoo.com, cnn.com, etc. However, there is only one AERO service for
        the link and all Proxy/Servers provide identical services.<a href="#appendix-A.6-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.6-2">Common Internet services provide differing strategies for
        advertising server addresses to clients. The strategy is conveyed
        through the DNS resource records returned in response to name
        resolution queries. As of January 2020 Internet-based 'nslookup'
        services were used to determine the following:<a href="#appendix-A.6-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-A.6-3.1">When a client resolves the domainname "google.com", the DNS
            always returns one A record (i.e., an IPv4 address) and one AAAA
            record (i.e., an IPv6 address). The client receives the same
            addresses each time it resolves the domainname via the same DNS
            resolver, but may receive different addresses when it resolves the
            domainname via different DNS resolvers. But, in each case, exactly
            one A and one AAAA record are returned.<a href="#appendix-A.6-3.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-A.6-3.2">When a client resolves the domainname "ietf.org", the DNS
            always returns one A record and one AAAA record with the same
            addresses regardless of which DNS resolver is used.<a href="#appendix-A.6-3.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-A.6-3.3">When a client resolves the domainname "yahoo.com", the DNS
            always returns a list of 4 A records and 4 AAAA records. Each time
            the client resolves the domainname via the same DNS resolver, the
            same list of addresses are returned but in randomized order (i.e.,
            consistent with a DNS round-robin strategy). But, interestingly,
            the same addresses are returned (albeit in randomized order) when
            the domainname is resolved via different DNS resolvers.<a href="#appendix-A.6-3.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-A.6-3.4">When a client resolves the domainname "amazon.com", the DNS
            always returns a list of 3 A records and no AAAA records. As with
            "yahoo.com", the same three A records are returned from any
            worldwide Internet connection point in randomized order.<a href="#appendix-A.6-3.4" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
        </ul>
<p id="appendix-A.6-4">The above example strategies show differing approaches to
        Internet resilience and service distribution offered by major Internet
        services. The Google approach exposes only a single IPv4 and a single
        IPv6 address to clients. Clients can then select whichever IP protocol
        version offers the best response, but will always use the same IP
        address according to the current Internet connection point. This means
        that the IP address offered by the network must lead to a
        highly-available server and/or service distribution point. In other
        words, resilience is predicated on high availability within the
        network and with no client-initiated failovers expected (i.e., it is
        all-or-nothing from the client's perspective). However, Google does
        provide for worldwide distributed service distribution by virtue of
        the fact that each Internet connection point responds with a different
        IPv6 and IPv4 address. The IETF approach is like google
        (all-or-nothing from the client's perspective), but provides only a
        single IPv4 or IPv6 address on a worldwide basis. This means that the
        addresses must be made highly-available at the network level with no
        client failover possibility, and if there is any worldwide service
        distribution it would need to be conducted by a network element that
        is reached via the IP address acting as a service distribution
        point.<a href="#appendix-A.6-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.6-5">In contrast to the Google and IETF philosophies, Yahoo and Amazon
        both provide clients with a (short) list of IP addresses with Yahoo
        providing both IP protocol versions and Amazon as IPv4-only. The order
        of the list is randomized with each name service query response, with
        the effect of round-robin load balancing for service distribution.
        With a short list of addresses, there is still expectation that the
        network will implement high availability for each address but in case
        any single address fails the client can switch over to using a
        different address. The balance then becomes one of function in the
        network vs function in the end system.<a href="#appendix-A.6-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.6-6">The same implications observed for common highly-available services
        in the Internet apply also to the AERO client/server architecture.
        When an AERO Client connects to one or more ANETs, it discovers one or
        more AERO Proxy/Server addresses through the mechanisms discussed in
        earlier sections. Each Proxy/Server address presumably leads to a
        fault-tolerant clustering arrangement such as supported by Linux-HA,
        Extended Virtual Synchrony or Paxos. Such an arrangement has
        precedence in common Internet service deployments in lightweight
        virtual machines without requiring expensive hardware deployment.
        Similarly, common Internet service deployments set service IP
        addresses on service distribution points that may relay requests to
        many different servers.<a href="#appendix-A.6-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.6-7">For AERO, the expectation is that a combination of the Google/IETF
        and Yahoo/Amazon philosophies would be employed. The AERO Client
        connects to different ANET access points and can receive 1-2
        Proxy/Server ADM-LLAs at each point. It then selects one AERO
        Proxy/Server address, and engages in RS/RA exchanges with the same
        Proxy/Server from all ANET connections. The Client remains with this
        Proxy/Server unless or until the Proxy/Server fails, in which case it
        can switch over to an alternate Proxy/Server. The Client can likewise
        switch over to a different Proxy/Server at any time if there is some
        reason for it to do so. So, the AERO expectation is for a balance of
        function in the network and end system, with fault tolerance and
        resilience at both levels.<a href="#appendix-A.6-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.7-1">AERO Proxy/Servers by default forward NS/NA messages to their
        dependent Clients which create neighbor cache entries for
        correspondents. The Client then becomes responsible for initiating
        mobility update signaling through the transmission of uNA messages to
        all active neighbors following a mobility event. However, in some
        environments this may constitute excessive control message overhead
        especially for Clients connected to low-end data links.<a href="#appendix-A.7-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.7-2">To avoid this NS/NA overhead, such disadvantaged Clients can engage
        their Hub Proxy/Servers according to the mobility anchor model. In
        this model, the Hub Proxy/Server is responsible for tracking all of
        the Client's active neighbors and the FHS Proxy/Servers for all of the
        Client's underlying interfaces are responsible for terminating the
        Client's multilink route optimization requests. The Hub is therefore
        responsible for reporting Client mobility events to neighbors through
        the transmission of uNA messages on behalf of the Client. To engage
        this model, the Client must consistently set the Code field in all RS
        messages it sends to the value 1.<a href="#appendix-A.7-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
