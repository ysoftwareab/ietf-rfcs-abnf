1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a set of MIB objects to manage a Power
   Ethernet [IEEE-802.3af] Source Equipment (PSE).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3. Overview

   The emergence of IP telephony as an application that allows for voice
   applications to be run over the same infrastructure as data
   applications led to the emergence of Ethernet IP phones, with similar
   functions and characteristics as the traditional phones. Powering a
   phone is one of these functions that are being taken as granted. The
   IEEE 802.3 Working Group initiated a standard work on this subject,
   currently known as the IEEE 802.3af work [IEEE-802.3af].

INTERNET DRAFT             Power Ethernet MIB                  June 2003


   The IEEE 802.3af WG did not define a full management interface, but
   only the hardware registers that will allow for a management
   interfaces to be built for a powered Ethernet device. The MIB module
   defined in this document extends the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
   [RFC2665] with the management objects required for the management of
   the powered Ethernet devices and ports.

   The following abbreviations are defined in [IEEE-802.3af] and will be
   used with the same significance in this document:

   PSE - Power Sourcing Equipment;

   PD - Powered Device



4. MIB Structure

   This MIB objects are included in three MIB groups.

   The pethPsePortTable defines the objects used for the configuration
   and describing the status of ports on a PSE device. Examples of PSE
   devices are Ethernet switches that support power Ethernet and mid-
   span boxes.

   The pethMainPseObjects MIB group defines the management objects for a
   managed main power source in a PSE device. Ethernet switches are one
   example of boxes that would support these objects.

   The pethNotificationControlTable includes objects that control the
   transmission of notifications by the agent to a management
   application.

          DESCRIPTION
                "The MIB module for managing Power Source Equipment
                 (PSE) working according to the IEEE 802.af Powered
                 Ethernet (DTE Power via MDI) standard.

                  The following terms are used throughout this
                  MIB module.  For complete formal definitions,
                  the IEEE 802.3 standards should be consulted
                  wherever possible:

                  Group - A recommended, but optional, entity
                  defined by the IEEE 802.3 management standard,
                  in order to support a modular numbering scheme.
                  The classical example allows an implementor to
                  represent field-replaceable units as groups of
                  ports, with the port numbering matching the
                  modular hardware implementation.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be

INTERNET DRAFT             Power Ethernet MIB                  June 2003


   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Setting the following object to incorrect values can result in
   improper operation of the PSE, including the possibility that the
   PD does not receive power from the PSE port:

      pethPsePortAdminEnable
      pethPsePortPowerPairs
      pethPsePortPowerPriority
      pethPsePortType

   Setting the following objects to incorrect values can result in an
   excessive number of traps being sent to network management stations:

      pethMainPseUsageThreshold
      pethNotificationControlEnable

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  These are:

      pethPsePortPowerPairsControlAbility
      pethPsePortPowerPriority
      pethPsePortPowerClassifications

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt their values when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate

   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
