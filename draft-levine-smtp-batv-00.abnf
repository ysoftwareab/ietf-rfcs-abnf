      If the creator of a bounce could make this assessment, all of
      earlier intermedite MTAs also could.  Hence, every MTA would be
      able to assess whether a message has an unauthorized
      RFC2821.MailFrom.

      Unfortunately, none of the multiple existing public key services
      has yet gained wide adoption.  Therefore, this specification is
      not able to provide a single method for public MailFrom validity
      checking.

local-part       = tag-type "=" tag-val "=" loc-core

tag-type         = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" )
                            ; specific, registered validation scheme

loc-core         = {original local-part value}

tag-val          = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" )
                            ; the validation data

tag-type       = "prvs"
                           ; simple private signature

tag-val        =  K DDD SSSSSS

K              =  1DIGIT
                           ; key number, to allow key rotation

DDD            =  3DIGIT
                           ; day number, low three digits of
                           ; the number of days since 1970
                           ; when the address will expire

SSSSSS         =  6HEXDIG
                           ; hex of the first three bytes of the
                           ; SHA-1 HMAC of <hash-source> and a key
