1  Introduction

   This document describes the need for granular information access
   protection and an approach for achieving it.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  The Problem 

   The commercialization of the Internet has provided a platform for
   enterprises to collaborate with their supply chains in a virtual,
   rather than physical sense. Originally this collaboration was limited
   to file transfer and e-mail but as new tools have become available,
   it has taken a more sophisticated direction.

   The tools for protecting information and services in an Internet
   based collaboration environment have not kept pace with this growth.

   Enterprises are basically limited to two techniques for protecting
   their information:

      o  Some form of tunnel based encryption (TLS, IPSec, etc.)

      o  Bulk encryption of the information itself.

   The limitation with encryption is that protection is on or off,
   providing limited granularity of permissible actions that can be
   applied to the protected information. Tunnel based encryption
   protection is tied to a session or security association and
   terminates when that relationship ends. While direct encryption of
   the information itself persists, the information protection toggles
   between protected but unusable and usable but unprotected states.

   As organizations continue to invest in collaboration capabilities and
   share large amounts of information with their suppliers, customers,
   and partners, there is a need for fine grained access control that
   can more precisely specify how the information will be used as well
   as providing audit capability that supports regulatory and
   contractual requirements. 

   There are current related product offerings that generally describe
   their capabilities as digital rights management technologies. To date
   these products assume that all participants have the same product and
   a tightly coupled identity system. This severely limits the ability

   to use any existing technology beyond corporate boundaries.

3  Non-Approach

   Information protection (except for encryption) is often confused with
   copy protection. This occurs partly because some copy protection
   technologies are referred to as Digital Rights Management (DRM)
   technologies and some information protection products or technologies
   are referred to as Information Rights Management and both are often
   shortened to just Rights Management.

   In spite of the name similarity, the security model for both is very
   different. In the case of copy protection technologies, the owner of
   the information does not trust the consumer, yet needs to provide a
   way for the consumer to use the information, typically tied to a
   hard- ware instance of the information.

   In the Information Access Control Model, the different parties are
   collaborators and the desire is to guide the allowed actions as the
   information passes through a workflow. This is no different in
   principle than having computer accounts with different privilege sets
   or different roles in a database management system. The goal is to
   transfer that same sort of granularity and accountability to the
   information itself, providing protection independent of application
   or operating systems controls that can move with the information.

   This document is specifically about the latter case, providing
   granular access for collaborating parties, and specifically not copy
   protection.


4  Approach

   This approach applies general authorization principles to
   information, treating information as any any other resource. These
   guidelines were first articulated in ISO 10181-3:1996 [ISO10181-3]
   and the Open Group's X/Open Distributed Security Framework (XDSF)
   [XDSF], produced in 1994. The main architectural component is the
   separation of authorization (or access control) functions between
   making the decision and enforcement of those decisions. 10181/XDSF
   designate these as Access COntrol Enforcement Functions (AEF) and
   Access COntrol Decision Functions (ADF).

   IETF Working Groups (AAA for example) and Standards (COPS RFC4261,
   etc) typically use the terms POlicy Decision Point (PDP) for the ADF
   and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) for the AEF. While a function, or
   operational capability, is more accurate than viewing these as single
   points in a network architecture, the terms PDP and PEP are in more
   common use so this document, while referencing the ISO model will use
   these terms.

   While a PDP/PEP architecture has generally been applied to network
   control, ISO 10181 takes a much more general approach and this same
   architecture is suitable for applications, operating systems controls
   and information itself.

5  Architecture

   Following the ISO model, some form of Policy Administration Point
   (PAP) would be used to apply specific access control policies to
   specified information instances or types. A PEP would apply the
   described protections to the information. A PDP would be consulted
   when applying and accessing the protected information. Access control
   protection is applied as follows:

      o  Current products and technologies apply this protection via an
      API to a software container or envelope that encapsulates the
      information. The protection is typically based on some form of
      encryption. Access decisions are based on specified rights which
      are typically linked to an identity management system that
      contains individuals and groups of individuals and their
      respective attributes.

      o  A participating application interacts with the access control
      service by querying it when access to a protected piece of
      information is required. If access is granted, the access control
      service supplies the required information to unlock the
      information to perform the granted access function.

   There are several candidates for standardization necessary to make
   different access control systems interact with each other.

      o  First there needs to be a standard protocol or set of protocols
      to convey the information access requests and grants. These could
      be based on (or profiles of) an existing access control protocol
      such as OASIS XACML, or they could be protocols more specialized
      to the information access control use case or some hybrid -
      potentially an abstract layer on XACML.

      o  Secondly, there needs to be a common API, container or
      mechanism to apply and remove the access control protection.

      o  Finally, there needs to be a standard set of tags or meta data
      to convey the information access protection requirements.

   Standardizing on these three areas should enable multi-vendor
   interoperability.

6  Security Considerations

   This is a requirements statement and proposed approach, not a
   proposal for technology. Any working group using this requirements
   technology or protocols should carefully consider the requirements
   and use them as part of an input to developing technical standards
   that will be robust and secure.
