       Integration of Unified Memory Space Protocol and Web Browser


Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [1].

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any

Abstract

   This document contains the general description of integration
   technology of Unified Memory Space Protocol (UMSP) [2, 3] with Web
   browser. This solution allows excluding the embedded program objects
   from Web pages completely. At the same time, any functions of active
   pages may be realized.

Terminology

   The server is the host, which carries out functions of a Web server.

   The client is the host, which requests Web pages.

   Job Control Point (JCP) is the host, which carries out the
   centralized control of UMSP job.

   VM is virtual machine, which executes an program code.

   Web page is a HTML or XML page.

Overview

   The scheme of system is shown in the following figure:

            Client                      Server

                           |     |

         |                 |     |                 |
         |                 | Net |                 |
       +-+-----------+     |     |      +----------+-+
       | Web browser +-----|     |------+ Web server |

                           |     |


   The interaction consists of the following steps:

      (1) The client requests a Web page from the server.

      (2) The server sends the requested page. This page includes the
          special UMSP tag. It may be <object> tag or other special tag.
          This tag may include initialization parameters of UMSP job and
          attributes of display on the page. The tag may have or may not
          have the embedded program code. The presence of a code does
          not influence on the functionalities of a page.

      (3) UMSP job must be initiated on the basis of data from received
          Web page. The client or the server can be the job initiator.
          The client or the server or other network node can carry out
          the JCP functions. Web browser (and Web server) and UMSP can
          use one or different connections. UMSP job can be initiated
          simultaneously with page sending.

      (4) After job initiation, the client or the server must initiate
          an exchange with Web page and/or other hosts. Parameters of
          initiation are taken from tag of Web page. The remote function
          call, code loading or access to memory may be used for
          interaction. Interaction methods are defined by the type of
          VM.

   The distributed job is executed in the private memory space. This job
   may have access to:

      O  All memory of Web page on the client or its part, which is
         defined by UMSP tag.

      O  API of Web browser for access to page.

      O  Another API of Web browser and of Web server, if VM and
         security politic allow it.
