   Native Short Addressing for Low power and Lossy Networks Expansion
                  draft-li-6lo-native-short-address-01

Abstract

   This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that
   enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a
   full length address may not be desirable.  This document focuses on
   carrying IP packets across a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in
   which the topology is relatively static where nodes' location is
   fixed and the connection between nodes is rather stable.  The changes
   in the logical topology are only caused by non-frequent disconnection
   in the link due to some reasons.  The specifications details NSA
   address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design,
   including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.

1.  Introduction

   There is an ongoing massive expansion of the network edge that is
   driven by the "Internet of Things" (IoT) technology, especially over
   low-power links which often, in the past, did not support IP packet
   transmission.

   Particularly driven by the requirements stemming from Industry 4.0
   and Smart City deployments, more and more devices/things are
   connected to the Internet.  Sensors in plants/parking bays/mines,
   temperature/humidity/flash sensors in museums, normally are located
   in a fixed position and are networked by low power and lossy links
   even in hard wired networks.  Comparing with traditional scenarios,
   scalability of the (edge) network along with lower power consumption
   are key technical requirements.  Moreover, large-scale Low power

   Lossy Networks (LLNs) are expected to be able to carry IPv6 packets
   over their links, together with an efficient access to native IPv6
   domains.

   The work in [SIXLOWPAN]/[SIXLO]/[LPWAN] Working Groups address many
   fundamental issues for those type of deployments.  Those deployments
   can be considered an instantiation of what [RFC8799] defines as
   "limited domains".  For instance, the 6lowpan compression technology
   ([RFC4944] and [RFC6282]) addresses the problem of IPv6 transmission
   over LLNs, making it possible to interconnect IPv6-based IoT networks
   and the Internet.  [RFC8138] introduces a framework for implementing
   multi-hop routing on an LLN using a compressed routing header, which
   works also with RPL (Routing Protocol for LLNs [RFC6550]).  This
   technique enables the ability to forward IPv6 packets within the
   domain without the need of decompression.  In addition, SCHC (Generic
   Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation
   [RFC8724]) enables even more compression by using a common static
   context.

   Although aforementioned technologies are suitable in general for all
   IoT scenarios, there could be more simplified solutions for those
   scenarios and applications with static network topology and stable
   network connections leveraging on wired technologies
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-use-cases] (e.g. smart building, smart parking, etc.).
   In those kind of deployments, topologies are planned in advance and
   well provisioned, with sensor nodes usually fixed in specific
   locations.  This draft presents a topology based addressing mechanism
   with shorter packet header and simpler forwarding rules for those
   static IoT networks.

   The specifications in this document leverage on previous work, namely
   using the dispatch type field ([RFC4944], [RFC8025]) that allows to
   accommodate the proposed address format.  This means that except the
   addresses (source and destination) the other fields of the header
   will be compressed mostly according to LPWAN_IPHC.  The proposed
   addressing is independent of Unique Local Addresses [RFC4193], which
   has a dependency on specific link-layer conventions [RFC6282].  It is
   also different from stateful address allocation that requires all
   nodes to obtain addresses from a centralized DHCP server, which leads
   to long network startup time and consumption of extra bandwidth.
   Compared to RPL-based routing [RFC6550], NSA avoids the extra
   overhead of address assignment by integrating address assignment and
   tree forming together.  Furthermore, NSA provides shorter packet
   header than non-storing mode RPL and much smaller routing table size
   than storing mode RPL.

3.  Overview

   Native Short Address (NSA) is an efficient topology-based network
   layer address assignment mechanism that is performed in a
   decentralized fashion.  The NSA nodes are aware of its own IPv6
   address constructed by IPv6 prefix (by configuration) and NSA (see
   Section 5.2).  Inside the NSA domain, nodes communicate with each
   other using only NSA addresses.  It is a smaller address space
   compared to the huge IPv6 addressing space.  The NSA enables
   stateless forwarding.  When IPv6 communication occurs between nodes
   inside the NSA domain and external IPv6 nodes, the border router,
   which plays as well the role of "root" in the addressing tree,
   performs network layer translation (as per Section 5.2 and
   [RFC6282]).  The architecture of NSA network is showed in Figure 1.

            Figure 1: The architecture of general NSA networks.

   The overall design objective is centered on how to minimize the
   packet overhead and reduce the size (or completely avoid the usage)
   of routing/forwarding table to save communication energy in an IoT
   LLN network.  NSA eliminates compression/decompression of the address
   and also reduces the amount of information synchronization messages,
   so it actually reduces computation complexity during packets parsing
   and forwarding.  To this end, NSA uses a context-independent address
   encoding mechanism.  It does not carry any field about address
   context in the packet.  It carries source and destination addresses
   by variable length fields whose size can be reduced to one octet each
   in the best case.  This allows the NSA packet header to be smaller
   than LOWPAN_IPHC's 7 octets (see Figure 2), down to 4 octets,
   representing around 40% reduction in the header size.  Considering
   that devices in the target limited domain are strongly constrained in
   resources, while still requiring to use a global unicast IPv6 address
   to identify them, 7 octets is the smallest size that LOWPAN_IPHC can
   achieve in a multi-hop environment, higher than the 2-3 octets
   necessary in a link-local communication [RFC6282].

   There are three distinct NSA features that allow NSA to be efficient,
   namely:

   1.  Native Short Address allocation (see Section 4),

   2.  Stateless forwarding (see Section 5),

   3.  Compact header format design (see Section 7) that avoids context
       and compression.

4.  NSA Allocation

   In an NSA network, there are 3 types of roles, namely:

   *  Root,

   *  Forwarder,

   *  Leaf.

   The basic rules of allocation include:

   *  Each node's address is prefixed by their parent's address.

   *  The forwarder runs an AF (Allocation Function) to generate its
      children's addresses.

   *  All nodes run the same AF in the same network instance.

   Normally, the root role is assigned to the border router when the LLN
   bootstraps.  An example of a possible result of an NSA deployment is
   shown in Figure 3.

                            root           +--------------------------+
                                 1         | append more bits to form |

   Each node acquiring a native short address needs to send an Address
   Request (AR) message to its link layer neighbors and wait for the
   response.  In the AR message, the node needs to designate a 'role'
   value (forwarder or leaf) and the 'nodeid'.  Forwarder and Leaf roles
   can be assigned similarly to IEEE 802.15.4, which distinguishes
   between Full-Function Devices (FFD) and reduced function devices
   (RFD) (cf., [ZigBee]).  If a neighbor is neither a forwarder nor the
   root, it will drop the message silently.  Otherwise, the neighbor
   should calculate an address based on parameters in the AR message.
   After the neighbor node assigns an address to the node, using the
   Allocation function (AF), it stores the suffix of that address as the
   interface ID towards the node.  Then, it generates and sends Address
   Assignment (AA) message back.  Once a node receives a valid AA
   response, it uses that assigned address as its own network layer
   address, thus becomes a child of the address assigner.  It will then
   ignore replies from other neighbors.  If a node does not receive any
   response after an pre-defined interval, it will send the AR message
   again.  It is RECOMMENDED that nodes re-send the AR message up to 3
   times, if no answer is received they SHOULD stop.

   The allocation function AF(role,i) used in this document is defined
   in Figure 4.  Where every forwarder node should store and maintain
   two indexes, one for the children that are forwarders and one for the
   children that are leaves (starting at 0 for the first child in each
   role).  Let's call the first index 'f', as of forwarder, and the
   second 'l' as for leaves.  The '+' symbol indicates a concatenation
   operation.  The b() operation indicates the binary string of '1' with
   length equal to its argument, for instance b(3) returns '111'.

        AF(role, f, l) = 'address of the node performing the function'
                       + (role == leaf? b(l++):b(f++))
                       + (role == leaf?'1':'0'),
        in which, f and l are the indexes of respectively the forwarders
        and the leaves at this layer (starting at 0).

          Figure 4: Definition of the Allocation Function (AF) of
                           forwarder/root nodes.

   Taking the example of the topology in Figure 3, the proposed AF works
   as follows.

   At the top level, there are 4 children of root, two are forwarders
   and the other two are leaves.  Starting from the left most node and
   moving to the right, the root node applies the AF as follows:

   *  For the first child, which is a forwarder:

      -  A('forwarder', 0, 0) = '1'(root address) + b(0) + '0' = '1' +
         '' + '0' = 10

      -  Index f is increased by one and is now equal 1 (f=1)

   *  For the second child, which is a leaf:

      -  A('leaf', 1, 0) = '1'(root address) + b(0) + '1' = '1' + '' +
         '1' = 11

      -  Index l is increased by one and is now equal 1 (l=1)

   *  For the third child, which is a forwarder:

      -  A('forwarder', 1, 1) = '1'(root address) + b(1) + '0' = '1' +
         '1' + '0' = 110

      -  Index f is increased by one and is now equal 2 (f=2)

   *  For the fourth child, which is a leaf:

      -  A('leaf', 2, 1) = '1'(root address) + b(1) + '1' = '1' + '1' +
         '1' = 111

      -  Index l is increased by one and is now equal 2 (l=2)

   The first level addresses have now been assigned.  Let's now have a
   look how the node 10 (the first forwarder child of the root) applies
   the same Allocation Function.  Note that node 10 will use its own 'f'
   and 'l' indexes initialized to 0.  Starting again from the left most
   node, node 10 applies the AF as follows:

   *  For the first child, which is a forwarder:

      -  A('forwarder', 0, 0) = '10'(node address) + b(0) + '0' = '10' +
         '' + '0' = 100

      -  Index f is increased by one and is now equal 1 (f=1)

   *  For the second child, which is a leaf:

      -  A('leaf', 1, 0) = '10'(node address) + b(0) + '1' = '10' + '' +
         '1' = 101

      -  Index l is increased by one and is now equal 1 (l=1)

   *  For the third child, which is a forwarder:

      -  A('forwarder', 1, 1) = '10'(node address) + b(1) + '0' = '10' +
         '1' + '0' = 1010

      -  Index f is increased by one and is now equal 2 (f=2)

   *  For the fourth child, which is a leaf:

      -  A('leaf', 2, 1) = '10'(node address) + b(1) + '1' = '10' + '1'
         + '1' = 1011

      -  Index l is increased by one and is now equal 2 (l=2)

   Note how the children of the same parent all have the same prefix (10
   in this example).  The proposed AF algorithmically assigns addresses
   to the different nodes without the need to know the topology in
   advance.  However, the largest address of the network will depend on
   the actual topology.  Indeed, the maximum length of an address with
   the proposed AF grows linearly at each level of the tree with the
   number of siblings from the same parent.  Let's take again the
   example in Figure 3 and let's assume that the children of node 10 are
   all leaves, for the largest address we need 2 bits to encode the
   parent node prefix (10 in this case) to which we need to add a number
   of '1' equal to the value of the l index which is the number of
   leaves minus one (because the first leaf has index 0), in this case
   since there are 4 leaves, the index value is 3 and we add the '111'
   string, hence the address length would be 6 (2 for the prefix, 3 to
   encode the 4th leaf address, and one for the final 1 the ends all
   leaves addresses).  In a more formal way the maximum address length
   at each level can be calculated as (where Ceiling just returns the
   least integer greater or equal its argument):

   Max_Length = length(Parent address)
                length(b(max(f,l)))
                + 1

   Where f and l are the indexes counting respectively the forwarders
        and the leaves at this level.

   The Allocation Function can be different from the one defined in
   Figure 4, but all nodes know which one to use by configuration.  The
   use of one and only one AF is allowed in an NSA domain.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that implementations support at least the AF proposed in
   this document (cf.  Section 9).

   Different allocation function may, for example, leverage on a priori
   knowledge of the topology in order to optimize the maximum address
   size and make it smaller.  For instance, because the order of address
   allocation has an impact on the size, the address of children with

   the largest sub-tree should be allocated in the first place so to
   reduce the average address length of the whole sub-tree.  Also,
   knowing the traffic in advance, or being able to have an estimate,
   can help to minimize the size of addresses that have a lot of
   traffic.  This kind of optimization can be an option, the
   specification of optimizations is out of the scope of this document
   and may be defined in new Allocation Functions to be added to the
   "Allocation Function Registry" (see Section 9).

4.1.  NSA Addresses and IPv6 Addresses

   Obtaining a full IPv6 address from a NSA address is pretty
   straightforward.  First the NSA address is concatenated to the
   configured IPv6 prefix.  Since the length of the NSA address is very
   likely smaller than 64 bits (the interface ID length in IPv6), the
   node needs to pad it with zeros ('0') used as most significative
   bits.  The full IPv6 address will look like: IPv6 prefix +
   "000...000" + NSA (or in IPv6 notation <IPv6 Prefix>::<NSA>).  The
   NSA is assigned by the root/forwarder as previously described.

   In an IPv6 communication, the node will derive the NSA address as the
   short source address from its own IPv6 address by simply removing the
   IPv6 prefix and all leading zeros before the NSA part.  The node will
   compare the destination IPv6 address with its own IPv6 address.  If
   they have the same prefix, it means that the destination is in the
   local NSA domain and its corresponding NSA address will be extracted
   as the short destination address (and the I/O Flag can be set
   accordingly).  Otherwise, it will be a communication towards the
   Internet.  In that case, a mapping mechanism implemented on the root
   node will generate a short address to be mapped to the full IPv6
   destination address.  As previously stated, the mapping mechanism is
   out of the scope of this document.

   Since the short mapped address is generated on the root, when the
   node first open the connection toward the external site, with a first
   packet, the destination address is set to the full, uncompressed,
   IPv6 address.  Once the packet arrives to the root node, performing
   the destination address lookup the root will notice that a full IPv6
   address is being used and will trigger the short address generation
   mechanism and create a new mapping.  Such, mapping is communicated to
   the source node via a new dedicated ICMP message (see Section 8).
   Once the node originating the communication receives such a message
   it MUST use the mapped short address for any further communication.

4.2.  Limitation of Number of Children Node

   The maximum number of child nodes is determined by the specific AF
   used.  IEEE 802.15.5 has explored the use of a per-branch setup,
   which, however, incurs scalability problems [LEE10].  NSA allocation
   design is more flexible and extensible than the one proposed in IEEE
   802.15.5.  The AF used as example in this document does not need any
   specific setup network by network, though it is still limited by the
   maximum length of addresses.  For the special case of the parent
   connecting to huge amount of children, a variant of the proposed AF
   can be designed to fulfill the requirement and optimize the address
   allocation (as previously described).

5.  Forwarding in a NSA Network

   Internal and external communications in an NSA network work slightly
   different.  For internal communications, among NSA endpoints, packets
   carry native short addresses and no special operation is needed.  For
   external communications, the root is responsible to perform the
   translation between native short addresses and IPv6 addresses.  For
   instance, for a packet entering into the NSA domain, the root will
   extract the native short address of the destination from the suffix
   of the IPv6 address, by removing all leading '0's.  It will also map
   the source IPv6 address to a mapped native short address, in order to
   make it more efficient for communication inside the NSA domain.

   The root has to store the mapping between external IPv6 addresses and
   their assigned mapped Native Short Addresses.  The method of
   generating those mapping is out of scope of this document, however,
   the addressing space for the external NSA has to be maintained
   separate from the internal NSA address space.  Overlap are allowed
   since the two addressing space are distinguishable in the packets by
   the use of the I/O field, as explained later on.

   The following paragraphs will detail the forwarding operations for
   both internal and external communication.  The intra-network
   forwarding procedure depends on the specific AF used.  Here we will
   use the AF previously introduced (see Figure 4) to illustrate the
   forwarding procedure.

5.1.  Forwarding toward an NSA endpoint

   To perform forwarding operations, NSA nodes access the I/O field in
   the NSA header (see Section 7).  When its value is 1, the packet is
   destined to an internal NSA node, so it is an inner-domain packet.
   Otherwise, the packet is destined to an external IPv6 node, so it is
   called an outer-domain packet.  Intra-domain packets carry a native
   short addresses in the source and the destination address fields.

Internet-Draft                     NSA                     December 2021


   More specifically the destination address field is the address of
   another node in the same NSA domain.  As such an NSA node performs
   the following sequence of actions (also see Figure 5):

   1.  Get destination address from packet (abbreviated to DA) and the
       current node's address (abbreviated to CA).  Go to step 2.

   2.  If length of DA is smaller than length of CA, send the packet to
       parent node, exit.  Otherwise, go to step 3.

   3.  If length of DA equals to length of CA, go to step 4.  Otherwise,
       go to step 5.

   4.  If DA and CA are the same, the packet arrived at destination,
       exit.  Otherwise, send the packet to parent node, exit.

   5.  Check whether CA is equal to the prefix of DA.  If yes, go to
       step 6.  Otherwise, send the packet to parent node, exit.

   6.  Calculate which child is the next hop address and forward packet
       to it.  With the AF propose in this document such operation
       reduces to reading the DA's bits starting from the position
       equals to the length of CA, then skip all '1' until the first '0'
       or the last bit of DA.  The sub-string obtained in such a way is
       the address of direct child of current node.

   7.  If any exception happens in the above steps, drop the packet and
       send error notification.

           Figure 5: Flow Chart of Internal Forwarding Procedure

   In the case of packet arriving from the Internet (external IPv6
   domain toward the local NSA domain) header adaptation operation is
   performed by the root node.  Concerning the destination address, the
   root builds the native short address of the destination by removing
   the prefix and the leading '0's of the suffix of the destination



Li, et al.                Expires 17 June 2022                 [Page 13]

   address.  Meanwhile, it checks whether it exists already a mapping
   between the source address and a mapped NSA address to be used as
   source address in the NSA packet.  If not it creates one.  Then the
   root creates the inner-domain packet.  It uses the NSA address as
   destination setting the I/O field to 1 so to route the packet to as
   described above to the destination node.  The mapped NSA address is
   used as source address and the fact that is a Mapped Address is
   signaled by setting to 1 the MA field.

5.2.  Forwarding toward an external IPv6 node

   In the case that the I/O field (cf.  Section 7) is set to 0, the
   packet is destined to an external IPv6 node, it is an outer-domain
   packet.  As such the destination address is either a full IPv6
   address (for the first packet of a communication) or a mapped short
   address generated by the root node and not belonging to any node
   inside the NSA domain.

   All NSA nodes (except root) just send packets that are destined
   outside the local domain (I/O field equal 0) to their parent, not
   even looking at the actual destination address.  Eventually all
   packets will reach the root node, which acts as gateway.  The root
   node is able to map the destination NSA address to the corresponding
   full IPv6 address.  Also, the root node is able to rebuild the full
   source IPv6 address by concatenating the IPv6 prefix and the NSA
   address as explained in Section 5.2.  Other fields of the header are
   also decompressed as described in Section 7.  A full IPv6 header
   replaces the original NSA header in the packet, which is then
   forwarded according to traditional IPv6 protocol.

6.  Benefits of Native Short Addressing

   The NSA use a single set of messages for address assignment and tree
   forming.  It is not more complex than RPL tree forming.  So, NSA
   saves the overhead of address assignment of RPL.

   Comparing to RPL with storing mode (see [RFC6550]), there is no need
   for a NSA node to generate and store routing table entries in the
   normal case.  One of the potential issues is the risk of renumbering
   of addresses in case of topology changes.  Because of the
   applicability domain of NSA, the common case of topology change is
   known in advance and can be planned, so to reduce disruption due to
   renumbering.  Another case is temporary link failures where the
   underlying technology is still able to provide connectivity through
   alternative links.

Internet-Draft                     NSA                     December 2021


   In this scenario a node can temporarily "move" along with its whole
   sub-tree.  Instead of performing a renumbering of the whole sub-tree,
   which may cause disruption, the sub-tree rooted on the "moving" node,
   its address and the addresses of all its children and grand-children
   can be kept unchanged, by creating a temporary entry in the
   forwarding tables of the original and new parent nodes, in order to
   make the sub-tree still reachable.

   Herewith one example, also depicted in Figure 6, node A with the
   address of 1000 somehow moves from node B (original parent) to node C
   (new parent).  In this case, the forwarding tables in B, C and their
   parents' nodes should be updated by adding a new entry to "1000", the
   address of node A.  Meanwhile, the original parent (node B) should
   keep its original address assignment.  Comparing with renumbering the
   addresses of node A and its children, the cost of adding one new
   route to their parent nodes is much lower, although in this case, the
   NSA does not implement complete stateless forwarding.  However, this
   solution SHOULD be used only in case of temporary topology changes,
   where the entries will be deleted once the original topology is re-
   established.  For permanent topology changes it is RECOMMENDED to re-
   run the NSA Allocation Function.

   As explained in Section 4, the addresses in NSA are of variable
   length, in this section, we outline the design of the header format
   partially based on the format of 6lowPAN, accommodating the variable
   length property in the packet.  The header format is shown in
   Figure 7.

                   Figure 7: Header format of NSA packets

   The first 4 bits are new dispatch types that will be introduced in
   Section 9.

   *  TF: The same definition as in [RFC6282] Section 3.1.1.

   *  NH: The same definition as in [RFC6282] Section 3.1.1.

   *  HL: This field indicates the hop limit.  When HL is 1, a hop limit
      field defined in [RFC2460] locates in in-line fields, while HL is
      0 means no hop limit header in packet.

   *  Payload length is a variable length field.  It normally occupies
      an octet assuming most packets are smaller than 252 octets.  For
      larger packets, payload length may expand to 2 to 3 octets.  The
      encoding method is defined as follows.  When the first octet has
      value of:

      -  0~252: Indicates how many octets the payload consist of.

      -  253: Indicates that there is an extra octet for payload length,
         with the actual length value equal to the last octet value plus
         252.

      -  254: Indicates that there is an extra two octets for payload
         length, with the actual length value obtained from the second
         and third octets interpreted as a 16 bits unsigned integer plus
         252 (from the first octet).

      -  255: Reserved.

   *  I/O: Indicates whether this packet is destined to a inner-domain
      node (value '1') or an outer-domain node (value '0'), where the
      former means from an NSA or IPv6 node to a NSA destination, while
      the latter means to an external IPv6 node.

   *  MA: Indicates the source address is actually a Mapped Address
      generated by the root.  When it is '1', the source address of the
      packet is a mapped address of an external IPv6 address, while if
      it is '0', the source address of the packet is an NSA address.

   For length variable native short address encoding, for both Source
   Address (SA) and Destination Address (DA), the definition is:

   *  0~252: if the address value locates in this interval, one octet is
      used to encode the value

   *  253: indicates that the following 2 octets encode the address.

   *  254: indicates that the following 4 octets encode the address.

   *  255: indicates that the following octet defines the length of
      address in octets, followed by the address octets.

   The sequence of in-line fields is as per [RFC8200] section 3.

8.  NSA Control Message

   This documents specifies only one NSA Control Message, namely the NSA
   Mapped Address Advertisement described in Section 4.  The purpose of
   such a message is advertise the mapping of an IPv6 address into a NSA
   address.  The map is performed by the root node and sent to the node
   originating the communication.  The root keeps a copy of the mapping
   to be used for future packets.  The format is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |          Target IPv6 Address (Fixed length 128 bist)          |
     |                                                               |
     |                                                               |

   *  Type: Type value identifying NSA Control Message.  Value to be
      assigned by IANA (cf.  Section 9)

   *  Code: This field identifies the specific control message.  In this
      case it is set to the value 0x00 "NSA Mapped Address for External
      IPv6 Address".

   *  Reserved: Set as 0 on transmission and ignored on reception.

   *  NSA Length: This field indicates the length of the Target NSA
      Address at the end of the message, expressed in octets.

   The "NSA Mapped Address for External IPv6 Address" is a variable
   length message, however, the first five fields of the message, namely
   Type, Code Reserved, NSA Length, and Target IPv6 address, have a
   fixed length of 160 bits (20 octets), hence the length of the NSA
   address is sufficient to calculate the length of the entire packet:
   20 octets + "NSA length".

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Dispatch Type Field

   This document requires IANA to assign the range 01010000 to 01011111
   in page 10 of the "Dispatch Type Field" registry as follows:

   +-------------+----+-----------------------------+---------------+
   | Bit Pattern |Page|         Header Type         | Reference     |
   +-------------+----+-----------------------------+---------------+
   | 0101TTNH    | 10 |  LOWPAN NSA IP(LOWPAN_NIP)  |[This Document]|
   +-------------+----+-----------------------------+---------------+

         Figure 8: LOWPAN Dispatch Type Field requested allocation

9.2.  Allocation Function Registry

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the NSA
   specification, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC8126].

   IANA is asked to create a registry named "Native Short Addresses
   (NSA) Parameters".

   Such registry should be populated with a one octet sub registry named
   "Allocation Function" and used to identify the AF used in a NSA
   deployment.  The sub registry is populated as follows:

Internet-Draft                     NSA                     December 2021


         +---------+----------------------------+-----------------+
         | Value   | AF Name                    | Reference       |
         +---------+----------------------------+-----------------+
         | 0x00    | Native Allocation Function | [This Document] |
         +---------+----------------------------+-----------------+
         |0x01-0xFF| Un-assigned                |                 |
         +---------+----------------------------+-----------------+

   Values can be assigned by IANA on a "First Come, First Served" basis
   according to [RFC8126].

9.3.  ICMP NSA Control Message

   IANA is requested to allocate an ICMPv6 type value from the "ICMPv6
   Parameters" registry to be used by "NSA Control Message".

   Also IANA is requested to create an "NSA Control Codes" sub registry,
   for the Code field of the ICMPv6 NSA Control Message.

   New codes may be allocated through the "Specification Required"
   procedure as defined in [RFC8126].  The following code is currently
   defined (the others are to be marked as un-assigned):

   +------+--------------------------------------------+---------------+
   | Code | Description                                | Reference     |
   +------+--------------------------------------------+---------------+
   | 0x00 |NSA Mapped Address for External IPv6 Address|[This Document]|
   +------+--------------------------------------------+---------------+

10.  Security Considerations

   An extended security analysis will be provided in future revision of
   this document.  As of this point we consider that the security
   considerations of [RFC4944], [RFC6282] apply.
