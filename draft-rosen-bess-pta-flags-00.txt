 IANA Registry for P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel Attribute Flags
                   draft-rosen-bess-pta-flags-00.txt

Abstract

   RFC6514 defines the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI
   Tunnel) attribute".  This attribute contains an octet of "flags".
   Only one flag is defined in that RFC, but there is now a need to
   define additional flags.  Since the RFC did not create a registry for
   the assignment of flag bits, this document updates the RFC by
   creating a registry for that purpose.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6514] defines the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI
   Tunnel) attribute".  This attribute contains an octet of "flags".
   Only one flag is defined in that RFC, but there is now a need to
   define additional flags.  Since the RFC did not create a registry for
   the assignment of flag bits, this document creates a registry for
   that purpose.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry called "P-Multicast
   Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Attribute Flags" in the
   "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.

   Per [RFC6514] section 5, a PMSI Tunnel Attribute contains a "Flags"
   octet.  The Flags field is a single octet, with bits numbered, left-
   to-right, from 0 to 7.  IANA is requested to initialize the registry
   as follows:
