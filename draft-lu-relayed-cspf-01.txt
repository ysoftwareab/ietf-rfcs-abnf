Abstract

   For LSPs that span across multiple areas or multiple autonomous
   systems (AS), the path computation element (PCE) in each area or each
   AS can cooperate and conclude the optimal results if so exist.  An
   upstream PCE, though incapable to carry out the path computation for
   the tailend outside of its domain, can provide the history of the
   computation to its downstream PCEs which will assume the computation
   job till it is accomplished or relay the baton to the next runner.

Internet-Draft  Relayed CSPF for Multi-Area Multi-AS PCE      April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The demand for multi-area multi-AS path computation ability has
   evolved from the academic discussion to carrier network's feature
   request.

   A few solutions have been proposed and there are three major
   variations in this field.

   A global TE database is ideal and the simplest for serving multi-area
   or multi-as path request.  This idea is apparently prohibitive for
   two reasons.

   1.  Such database may be too big and negate the purpose of having
       multiple areas or ASes;

   2.  This violates the information hiding and confidentiality
       requirement and is unacceptable by ISPs.

   A crankback method is more practical as it is an exhaustive search
   based mechanism and will find an LSP if it exists.  The drawback
   nevertheless is obvious:

   1.  It does not scale, for one that it often requires and wastes more
       than one tryout to find a qualified LSP, and for two it is RSVP
       signaling based which is by its nature poor in scaling;

   2.  The extra signaling messages add burdens on the existing network;

   3.  The path, if found, is not guaranteed optimal;

   4.  It requires lots of manual configurations to specify border
       routers and hence is labor intensive;

   5.  It requires substantial RSVP changes, in both protocol and
       operation.

   BRPC [RFC5441] is another idea in coping with the aforementioned
   problems.  It assumes that the destination is known in a particular
   domain and area.  This assumption is not always true.  Besides the
   destination may be multi-homed, meaning reachable through different
   areas and domains.  The RFC method cannot handle this.  Further more,
   the RFC's procedure mandates a PCEP [RFC5440] extension which
   understands the Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT).  This further
   complicates the method.  Further more, VSPT approach only address one
   destination at a time.

   This document describes a relayed CSPF based PCE scheme which offers

   a solution with optimality, scalability, and simplicity.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Acronyms

   CSPF - Constrained Shortest Path First

   PCE -  Path Computation Element

   PCReq -  Path Computation Request

   PCRep -  Path Computation Reply

   AS -   Autonomous System

   LSP -  Label Switched Path

   RSVP - Resource ReserVation Protocol

   PCEP - PCE to PCE Communication Protocol

   SPT -  Shortest Path Tree

   VSPT - Virtual Shortest Path Tree


2.  CSPF Seed

   Call the node initially deposited into the heap seed.  CSPF, or more
   generically SPF, is a seed based algorithm.  The entire SPT is built
   upon this seed.

2.1.  Multiple Seeds

   It is not necessary, however, that the heap can have only one seed.
   In fact, most of the time during the SPF expansion, the heap contains
   many nodes which can be perceived as seeds for further expansion.

2.2.  Heap Equivalence

   An SPF heap possesses following properties:





Lu, et al.              Expires October 30, 2011                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Relayed CSPF for Multi-Area Multi-AS PCE      April 2011


   1.  A heap with one initial seed is equivalent to that with multiple
       intermediate seeds in any SPF stages for the destinations that
       have not yet been reached.

   2.  The deposit time of seeds is insensitive to destinations that
       have not yet been reached, provided that the seeds carry correct
       attributes values such as cost and nexthop.

   3.  The multiple seeds in property 1 can further be reduced to those
       that constitute a set of nodes besides which the destinations are
       not viable.

2.2.1.  SPT Equivalence

   The property 1 is not difficult to comprehend.  During normal SPF
   cycles, the heap will change and the path tree will grow.  At any SPF
   cycle, the path tree records reachability to certain destinations.
   This is important to generic SPF applications such as IGP routing
   protocols.  With IGP, either OSPF [RFC2328] or IS-IS
   [RFC1195][ISO.10589.1992], all destinations must be included, whether
   they come out of the heap early or late.  None of those can be
   neglected.

   Nevertheless in CSPF, since only the targeted destinations matter,
   non-relevant records can be thrown away.  The early path tree records
   are insignificant and can be disregarded.  Therefore for the selected
   destinations, the expanded heap with multiple seeds is equivalent
   with the heap at the initial stage.

   Figure 1 gives a simple illustration of this concept.  With normal
   SPF computation, the Headend node "H" is used as an initial seed to
   the SPF heap.  The final shortest path tree (SPT) will provide
   reachability to nodes "A", "B" and the Tailend node "T".  If one uses
   nodes "A" and "B" as deposit seeds, he will conclude a SPT with the
   same reachability for "T".  The difference between the two SPTs is
   the reachabilities from "H" to nodes "A" and "B".


                                     A
                                    / \
                                   H   T
                                    \ /
                                     B

2.2.2.  Seed Deposit Timing

   The second property indicates that the seed deposit time does not
   change its SPT contribution for destinations that have not yet been
   reached.  Figure 2 shows this concept in detail.


                                  ---A---
                                 /       \
                                H--B---C--T

                       Figure 2: Seed Deposit Timing

   For destination "T", using seed set "A" and "B", or "A" and "C" will
   produce identical results.

2.2.3.  Seed Set Reduction

   The third property allows us to remove the seeds that will not
   contribute to the path to the destinations.  The statement is the key
   point that this proposal is based upon.

   As shown in Figure 3, for the reachability to "T", the initial seed
   "H" can be replaced with "A and B", per property 1.  The two seeds
   can further be replaced with "A, C and D", per property 2.  Now since
   "D" will not contribute to the path to "T", the seed set "A, C, D"
   can further be reduced to "A and C", which is the property 3.


                                  ---A---
                                 /       \
                                H--B---C--T
                                    \
                                     --D--E

                       Figure 3: Seed Set Reduction

   These properties are the base of multi-area multi-AS path computation
   method described in this document.


3.  Multi-Area Path Computation

3.1.  Inter-area PCE

   Per IGP nature, the Tailend in a different area are not visible to
   the computing PCE if the PCE only knows the TE database of the
   Headend area.  There exist options for multi-area TE database or even



Lu, et al.              Expires October 30, 2011                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Relayed CSPF for Multi-Area Multi-AS PCE      April 2011


   a global multi-AS TE-database.  But that will have scalability and
   confidentiality consequences.  And this option is beyond of the scope
   of this document.  Nevertheless, using the method of this document,
   the cross-area path can be achieved with no need of global TE
   database, nor much manual intervention.

3.2.  Initial Seed Set

   Area border routers, or BN (Border Nodes) for short, lie in the
   necessary paths to the destination in next area, or areas beyond.
   They are natural choices of the initial seed set.

3.3.  PCE Relay

   The path computation proceeds as a relayed CSPF job, one per area.
   Take Figure 4 for example, assuming routers "A" and "C" are BNs.  The
   column line divides the topology into two areas, area "west" on the
   left, and "east" on the right.


                                 west : east
                                  ----A--
                                 /    :  \
                                H--B--C---T
                                      :

                            Figure 4: PCE Relay

   Following steps describe the procedure:

   a.  PCE in area "west", or PCE-west for short, computes paths to "A"
       and "C";

   b.  PCE-west sends PCReq to PCE of "east" for relayed CSPF.  The path
       information to "A" and "C" are encoded in the same PCReq message.
       The path information contains path attributes such as cost,
       bandwidth, admin-group, hop-count, etc.

   c.  PCE-east uses the path information to BNs "A" and "C" and
       deposits them to its SPF heap.  It then starts its SPF, and
       concludes the path computation to "T".  The path to "T" if found,
       will be the segment in area "east".

   d.  PCE-east then sends PCRep back to PCE-west with its path segment
       information.

   e.  PCE-west maps the received path segment to one of BNs.  It then
       stitches the segment to the one in area "west" and forms a

       complete path.

   If the destination is not in east, but further in an area eastward,
   PCE-east will relay the PCReq to a PCE further downstream, which will
   either find the target or continue to relay the job.  The stitching
   will proceed likewise, but in the reversed order.

3.4.  Relay Content

   Besides standard PCReq format, an extension to PCEP protocol is
   needed to allow encoding of seed information.  Following table
   describes the minimum data fields:

           This TLV MAY have one or more occurrences

   There is no need to carry admin-group or bandwidth information.
   These can be learned from the standard path request information
   fields.

3.5.  PCE Elect

   An area PCE has to know all BNs which connect to another area.  This
   can be achieved with the help from the IGP protocols and their TE
   extensions.  The method itself however is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   Once the list of BNs is known, the area PCE can send PCReq to PCEs in
   other areas.  For a particular downstream area, only one PCE is
   necessary.  Among eligible PCEs, an election mechanism may be
   necessary to avoid the waste and contention of computation resources.
   The elect PCE can be any router or a dedicated PCE.  It does not have
   to be the transit router.

   Any tie-breaker algorithm can be used in such election.  One simple
   method is to choose the one with the highest (or lowest) router ID.

   The election is a local decision of the requesting PCE.  It can be
   proprietary and does not require standardization.


4.  Multi-Home Tail-End

   A destination may be viable through multiple areas.  This happens
   typically in dual-homed or multi-homed destination cases.  To
   maximize the path availability and optimality, the PCReq SHOULD be
   sent to each neighboring area and to each area's PCE elect.

   As shown in Figure 6, the Headend in area A may reach out through its
   borders with area B and area C. Each PCReq message it sends is

Internet-Draft  Relayed CSPF for Multi-Area Multi-AS PCE      April 2011


   different per recipient PCE's service area, either B or C. For PCE of
   area B, the message encodes the seeds of BNs between area A and B.
   Likewise the PCReq for PCE of area C lists seeds of BNs between A and
   C.

   Both PCEs may find paths to the tailend, and send PCRep back to the
   Headend in A. To accommodate the race condition to two possible
   paths, the requester needs to implement a timer to allow reasonable
   wait time to collect all possible PCRep, details in the next section.

   The sending of multiple PCReq is not limited to the headend.  It can
   happen to any intermediate PCEs as far as they have multiple exit

4.1.  Relay Timer

   A PCE should always send PCRep back to its requester whether it finds
   the path successfully or not.  However the PCRep may take time and
   may be lost at all.  For this reason it is advisable for the
   requester to instantiate a relay timer so that it will not wait
   indefinitely if the PCRep never comes.  The timer also facilitates
   the requester to collect and compare all returning PCRep.  Figure 7
   is a sample pseudo code of the timer logic.

              add_to_PCReq_Pending_List(PCE_Elect);
              if (relay_timer==NULL) {

              }

          path = retrieve_from(PCRep, PCE_Elect);
          best_path = better_path(best_path, path);
          remove_from_PCReq_Pending_List(PCE_Elect);
          if (Pending_List==NULL) {
              Cancel_timer(relay_timer);
              if (self==Headend) {
                  terminate;
              } else {

5.  Multi-AS Path Computation

   For path computation across different autonomous systems, the methods
   for multi-area in section 3 mostly apply as well except a few special
   handlings described below.

5.1.  Information Hiding

   When a PCE sends a PCRep to the requester which is in a different AS,
   it does not send explicit hop-by-hop EROs.  Instead it sends a loose
   ERO with path level characters such as cost metric.  This ensures the

   information hiding from different ASes while the End-to-End path can
   still be established.

5.2.  Transit Link

   Unlike the multi-area setup where an area border router sits over
   both areas, two AS border routers need a transit link to connect them
   together.


                            ----- Transit -----
                            |AS1|---------|AS2|
                            -----  Link   -----

                          Figure 8: Transit Link

   As shown in Figure 8, the transit link needs to be considered for an
   ASBR when it is to send PCReq to its peer ASBR.  The link's
   characters such as metric, hop count, bandwidth, MUST be taken into
   account of the seed value.  The PCReq relay logic remains the same.

5.3.  AS Number

   The BN election concept does not apply in cross AS BNs.  There is no
   need to carry the AS number into the TE database.  The PCReq and the
   corresponding seeds SHOULD be sent to each viable AS peer node.


6.  Other Cases

6.1.  Backups

   Backup LSPs, or bypass LSPs, or pass re-optimization, or any path
   computation that requires the knowledge of an existing LSP MUST have
   the information of that LSP passed along with the PCReq and seeds.
   In case of multi-AS path computation, the upstream LSR MUST hide the
   path segment detail from the downstream LSR.

6.2.  SRLG

   The SRLG handling should be no different than that of single AS
   single area path computation.  As long as the SRLG information is
   available, through for example GMPLS, each relayed PCE should compute
   correct PCE segment, and the end-to-end path should meet SRLG
   requirement.

6.3.  Loose ERO

   In multi-AS case, since the explicit EROs are not passed back, the AS
   border router has to recover the path segment that it promised
   upstream LSR when the LSP request reaches it.  Following two
   approaches can be used for this purpose.

6.3.1.  Pre-computed EROs

   The LSR remembers and makes a record of the path segment.  When RSVP
   request comes into the ASBR LSR, it already has resolved EROs stored
   locally.  This is quick but requires RSVP implementation change.

6.3.2.  Re-Query

   The LSR does not need to remember the explicit path segment.  It is
   kept stateless.  When requested, the ASBR LSR will query its own PCE,
   because it does not remember the previous query and has forgotten its
   response.  The result nevertheless should be the same, provided the
   topology has no changes since.

   If the answer is different or no longer available, the network has
   dramatically changed.  The whole path computation process needs redo.
   And this has to be done anyway regardless of the method.
