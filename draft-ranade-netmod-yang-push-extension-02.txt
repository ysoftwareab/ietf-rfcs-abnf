1.  Introduction

   The subscription mechanism defined in yang-push draft
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] supports a subscription mechanism where
   datastore and its datanodes can be provided as targets.  However
   there are a few scenarios where a subscription to datanodes may not
   be sufficient.

   o  An application on the client, may want to track the configuration
      changes in a particular module.  If a module contains "config
      true" mixed with "config false" nodes, setting up a filter which
      targets only "config true" nodes at multiple levels will be
      cumbersome.

   o  An application on the client, may want to track the origin of the
      recently applied configuration.  Yang-push subscription currently
      does not provide such control.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  operational state datastore

   o  intended configuration datastore

2.  Yang Push Subscription Extensions

   There are two new filter nodes added to the Yang push subscription
   mechanism.  They are listed below.

   o  config-filter

   o  with-origin

2.1.  Config Filter

   This is a filter for nodes with the given value for their 'config'
   property.  When this leaf is set to 'true', only 'config true' nodes
   are selected and, when set to 'false', only 'config false' nodes are
   selected.  If this leaf is not present, this filter is not applied.

2.2.  Origin Metadata Attribute

   This document defines the "with-origin" parameter, which if present,
   requests that the server includes "origin" metadata annotations as
   defined in [RFC8342] in notifications which are part of this
   subscription.  This parameter is only valid for the operational state
   datastore and any datastores with identities derived from the
   "operational" identity.  Otherwise, if an invalid datastore is
   specified then a suitable error is returned.

   Data in the operational state datastore can come from multiple
   sources.  The server should return the most accurate value for the
   "origin" metadata annotation as possible, indicating the source of
   the operational value, as specified in Section 5.3.4 of RFC8342 [1]

   When encoding the origin metadata annotation for a hierarchy of
   returned nodes, the annotation may be omitted for a child node when
   the value matches that of the parent node, as described in the "ietf-
   origin" YANG module [RFC8342].

   The "with-origin" parameter is optional to support.  It is identified
   with the feature "origin".

3.  Examples of usage

   In this example, the following fictional module is used:

   module example-interface {
     yang-version 1.1;
     namespace urn:example:interface;
     prefix int;

     import ietf-inet-types {
       prefix inet;
     }

     container interface {
       leaf name{
         type string;
       }

       leaf speed{
         type string;
         config false;
       }
     }
   }

   A subscription on the "config true" nodes of the operational state
   datastore.  This subscription also requests to get the origin of the
   datanodes as part of Yang-push notifications.  This is considering
   that the NETCONF protocol was used for this subscription.

<rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:1.0">
  <establish-subscription \
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"\
      xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push" \
      xmlns:ypext="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push-ext">
    <yp:datastore>operational</yp:datastore>
    <ypext:config-filter>true</ypext:config-filter>
    <ypext:with-origin/>
  </establish-subscription>
</rpc>

   The operator has configured an interface ("eth1"), the system has
   recognised an interface ("eth0") which was plugged in recently.  The
   below NETCONF notification is an example for a yang-push notification
   when the device applies the "eth0" configuration.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].
   The following registration has been made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push-ext

      Registrant Contact: The IESG.

      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   Registry [RFC6020].  The following registration has been made:

      name: ietf-yang-push-ext

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push-ext

      prefix: ypext

      RFC: xxxx

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The origin metadata annotation exposes the origin of values in the
   applied configuration.  Origin information may provide hints that
   certain control-plane protocols are active on a device.  Since origin
   information is tied to applied configuration values, it is only
   accessible to clients that have the permissions to read the applied
   configuration values.  Security administrators should consider the
   sensitivity of origin information while defining access control
   rules.
