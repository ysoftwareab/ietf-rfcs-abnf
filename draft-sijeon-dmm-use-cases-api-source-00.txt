1. Introduction

   In [draft-yegin-dmm-ondemand-mobility], it makes an attempt to
   classify the source IP address type for a mobile host, depending on
   the need of IP session continuity and/or IP address reachability.
   Therefore, three types of IP addresses were defined with regard to
   the mobility management; fixed IP address, sustained IP address, and
   nomadic IP address.

   After introducing the three types of IP addresses, it proposed a
   solution for the applications running on the mobile host to indicate
   whether they need IP session continuity or IP address reachability.

   When an application tries to get an IP address, it may require or
   prefer specific type of IP address or non-specific (any) type of it
   to the IP stack. The proposed approach aims to obtain a proper IP

   address corresponding to a specific address requirement, whereas the
   former approaches [RFC5014][RFC6724] operate on the available set of
   IP addresses, based on a preference.

   But even in the specific type of IP address request, there may be a
   need to indicate further requirements such as which IP address is
   more preferred among already configured multiple IP addresses based
   on the same type requested. Such a situation is easily met over a
   DMM network environment for some reasons such as QoS or Policy, as a
   mobile host is supposed to obtain a new prefix at each new mobility
   access router.

   Aligned with the needs, this draft specifies and describes expected
   use cases and proposes required extensions to support the given use
   cases. This draft is based on the [draft-yegin-dmm-ondemand-
   mobility] that proposed the three types of IP addresses with regard
   to the mobility management.

2. Use Cases

   We specify and analyse expected use cases when an application
   session is initiated. Furthermore, we organize the use cases
   according to the requested IP address type and additional
   requirement.

2.1. When an application does not need to request a specific IP address
   type and requirement

   Applications such as a text-based web browsing or information-
   centric service, e.g. weather and stock information may belong to
   this category. The suggested flag, IPV6_REQ_NOMADIC_IP, defined in
   [draft-yegin-dmm-ondemand-mobility] is used for expressing its
   preference to the IP stack. But it does not require a further
   signaling between the mobile host and the network, as a nomadic IP
   address is obtained by default whenever the mobile host is attached
   at an (mobility) access router. That is, obtaining this type of IP
   address could be orthogonal with the IP request by the application.
   However, it is only valid while the mobile host stays at the
   attached mobility access router.

2.2. When an application needs to request specific IP address type and
   requirement

   This category is for an application requiring IP session continuity
   with different granularity of IP address reachability. This case is
   again divided by three sub-cases with regard to IP address type
   availability and/or address selection, if needed. But the request of

   nomadic IP address is excluded in following cases, since it is given
   by default as described in Section 3.1.

2.2.1. Case 1: there is no available IP address based on a requested
   type in the IP stack.

   For resource-efficiency mobility support, the dynamic configuration
   of a sustained IP or fixed IP address can be preferred. Since there
   is a nomadic IP address configured in the IP stack, when a new type
   of IP address is needed, additional support mechanism is needed to
   express the preference of the application.

   In  this  case,  the  IP  stack  triggers  one  of  the  IP  address
   configuration  mechanisms  (e.g.  DHCPv6,  SLAAC,  or  IP  mobility
   protocols).

2.2.2. Case 2: there are one or more IP addresses based on a requested
   type in the IP stack, and no selection preference by the
   application.

   The mobile host already has the IP addresses following a requested
   IP address type by the application. In this case, the default
   address selection rules will apply [RFC6724], i.e. scope preference
   and longest prefix matching. The best-matched IP address among them
   will be selected.

2.2.3. Case 3: there are one or more IP addresses based on a requested
   type in the IP stack, but there is a selection preference by the
   application.

   In case of fixed IP address, the default address selection rule can
   simply be applied so that one IP address can be selected.

   In case of sustained IP address, taking into account the benefits of
   on-demand mobility from several DMM solution proposals, it is highly
   preferred for a mobile host to use a sustained IP address based on
   the prefix from a currently attached router.

   By following the default address selection algorithm, only the best-
   matched IP address will be selected, which may not be "the best" in
   terms of optimal routing and network resource spent. Indicating the
   host's preference will be required (See Section 4 for the proposed
   flag).

   For instance, suppose that an MN has already a sustained IP address
   (PrefA::) obtained in the IP stack when it stayed at network A and
   now it moved to network B. We also suppose that another application

   wants to configure a sustained IP address, but based on a new prefix
   from currently attached network for optimal routing. Without any
   indication by the application, the existing sustained IP address
   (PrefA::) will be selected and the session will be anchored at
   network A, which may lead to inefficiency to application performance
   and network resource due to sub-optimal routing.

3. Indications for expressing requirements

   When an application prefers a new IP address of the requested IP
   address  type,  additional  indication  flags  should  be  delivered
   through the socket API interface.

3.1. Suggested indication flag

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NEW

   /* Prefer a new IP address based on a requested IP address type as
   source */

   This flag is proposed to be added in RFC5014, and aims to express
   the preference for enabling differentiated per-flow anchoring. The
   use of the flag can be combined together with the three types of IP
   address defined in [draft-yegin-dmm-ondemand-mobility]. It is in
   equal degree and orthogonal with the defined flag-set in IPv6 socket
   API for source address selection [RFC5014].
