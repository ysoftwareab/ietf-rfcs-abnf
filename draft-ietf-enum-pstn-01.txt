Abstract 
    
   This document registers the Enumservice “pstn” and subtype “tel” 
   using the URI scheme ‘tel:’, as well as the subtype “sip” using the 
   URI scheme ‘sip’ as per the IANA registration process defined in the 
   ENUM specification, RFC 3761.  This data is used to facilitate the 
   routing of telephone calls in those countries where Number 
   Portability exists.

2. Introduction 
    
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that transforms 
   E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication Number 
   Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and then uses 
   DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through NS records 
   and NAPTR records (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part 
   Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database, RFC 3403 [4]) to look 
   up what services are available for a specific domain name. 
    
   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines 
   given in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning in the services 
   field of a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate the types of 
   functionality associated with an end point and/or telephone number.  
   The registration is defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation

   Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" 
   DDDS Application defined in RFC 3761. 
    
   Number Portability allows telephone subscribers to keep their 
   telephone numbers when they change service provider, move to a new 
   location, or change the subscribed services [14].  In many counties, 
   such as the United States and Canada, the functions of naming and 
   addressing on the PSTN have been abstracted.  In the case of a ported 
   number, the dialed number is not directly routable on the PSTN and 
   must be translated into a routing number for call completion.  Other 
   numbers, which are not ported, and which can be routed directly on 
   the PSTN based on the dialed number, are typically assigned to 
   carriers and other entities in large blocks or pools.  This non-
   ported numbering information is distributed in a variety of methods 
   and formats around the world.  
    
   The following Enumservice is registered with this document: "pstn" to 
   indicate PSTN routing data, including number portability data, non-
   ported telephone number data (individually or in number blocks), and 
   other PSTN-oriented data that is associated with E.164 telephone 
   numbers.  The purpose of this Enumservice is to describe information 
   about telephone numbers which cannot be used on the public Internet 
   or a private/peered Internet Protocol (IP) network.  Thus, these are 
   numbers which are only reachable via the traditional Public Switched 
   Telephone Network (PSTN). 
    
   This Enumservice could enable carriers, as well as other service 
   providers and users, to place ported, pooled, and blocks of numbers 
   and their associated PSTN contact information, into ENUM databases, 
   using standardized, non-proprietary methods.  This, in turn, could 
   enable such parties to consolidate all telephone number lookups in 
   their networks into a single ENUM lookup, thereby simplifying call 
   routing and network operations, which would then result in either an 
   on-net, or IP-based response, or off-net, PSTN-based response.  It is 
   conceivable that being able to query for this information in ENUM 
   could significantly reduce or eliminate the need for these parties to 
   maintain traditional, SS7/TCAP/SIGTRAN-based query gateways, 
   applications, and protocols in their networks. 
    
   The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 dictate that a "type" and 
   a "subtype" should be specified.  Within this set of specifications 
   the convention is assumed that the "type" (being the more generic 
   term) defines the service and the "subtype" defines the URI scheme. 
    
   When only one URI scheme is associated with a given service, it 
   should be assumed that an additional URI scheme to be used with this 
   service may be added at a later time.  Thus, the subtype is needed to 
   identify the specific Enumservice intended.

   In this document, two URI schemes are specified.  The first is 
   'tel:', as specified in RFC 3966 [9], and as further specified with 
   number portability data in draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt [10] 
   (Internet-Draft New Parameters for the "tel" URI to Support Number 
   Portability, draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt [10]).  And since 
   software implementations using ‘tel’ URIs are somewhat limited, a 
   second URI scheme can be used, ‘sip:’, as specified in RFC 3261 [11]. 
    
3. Distribution of Data 
    
   The distribution of number portability data is often highly 
   restricted either by contract or regulation of a National Regulatory 
   Authority (NRA), therefore NAPTR records specified herein may or may 
   not be part of the e164.arpa DNS tree. 
    
   The NAPTR records described herein probably would not be part of the 
   e164.arpa DNS tree.  Distribution of this NAPTR data would be either 
   (a) on a private basis (within a service provider’s internal network, 
   or on a private basis between one or more parties using a variety of 
   security mechanisms to prohibit general public access), (b) openly 
   available or, (c) distributed by the relevant number portability 
   organization or other industry organization, but possibly on a 
   national basis and subject to or in accordance with national 
   regulatory policy. 
    
   The authors believe that it is more likely that these records will be 
   distributed on a purely private basis.  If such data was distributed 
   nationally, the national telephone numbering authority, or some other 
   regulatory body or numbering organization, may have jurisdiction.  
   Such a body may choose to restrict distribution of the data in such a 
   way that it may not pass over that country’s national borders.  How 
   number portability data is collected and distributed is out of scope 
   of this document. 
    
4. Record Conflict Resolution 
    
   It is likely that, in some cases, a query will return multiple 
   records.  In this case, this could result in what is essentially an 
   on-net and off-net record.  Thus, one record gives the associated 
   address on an IP network, while the other gives the associated 
   address on the PSTN.  As with multiple records resulting from a 
   typical ENUM query of the e164.arpa tree, it is up to the application 
   using an ENUM resolver to determine which record(s) to use and which 
   record(s) to ignore.  For example, such a resolver could be 
   configured to grant preference to the on-net record, or execute other 
   logic as required by the application.

6. Examples 
 
   The following sub-sections document several examples for illustrative 
   purposes.  These examples shall in no way limit the various forms 
   that this Enumservice may take. 
    
6.1 Example of a Ported Number, Using a ‘tel’ URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:tel" 
      "!^.*$!tel:+1-215-981-7813;rn=+1-215-555-1212;npdi!". 
    
   In this example, a Routing Number (rn) and a Number Portability Dip 
   Indicator (npdi) are used as shown in draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt 
   [10] (Internet-Draft New Parameters for the "tel" URI to Support 
   Number Portability, draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt [10]).  The ‘npdi’ 
   field is included in order to prevent subsequent lookups in legacy-
   style PSTN databases.

   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:sip" 
      "!^.*$!sip:+1-215-981-7813;rn=+1-215-555-
   1212;npdi@gw.example.com;user=phone!". 
    
   In this example, a Routing Number (rn) and a Number Portability Dip 
   Indicator (npdi) are used as shown in draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt 
   [10] (Internet-Draft New Parameters for the "tel" URI to Support 
   Number Portability, draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt [10]).  The ‘npdi’ 
   field is included in order to prevent subsequent lookups in legacy-
   style PSTN databases.  The method of conversion from a tel to a SIP 
   URI is as demonstrated in RFC 3261, Section 19.1.6 [11], as well as 
   in , draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt Section 6.3 [10]. 
    
6.3 Example of a Non-Ported Number, Using a ‘tel’ URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:tel" 
      "!^.*$!tel:+1-215-981-7813;npdi!". 
    
   In this example, a Number Portability Dip Indicator (npdi) is used 
   [10].  The ‘npdi’ field is included in order to prevent subsequent 
   lookups in legacy-style PSTN databases. 
    
6.4 Example of a Non-Ported Number, Using a ‘sip’ URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:sip" 
      "!^.*$!sip:+1-215-981-7813;npdi@gw.example.com;user=phone!". 
    
   In this example, a Number Portability Dip Indicator (npdi) is used 
   [10].  The ‘npdi’ field is included in order to prevent subsequent 
   lookups in legacy-style PSTN databases.  The method of conversion 
   from a tel to a SIP URI is as demonstrated in RFC 3261, Section 
   19.1.6 [11], as well as in , draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-07.txt Section 
   6.3 [10]. 
    
6.5 Example Using a Regular Expression 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:tel" 
      "!^.*$!tel:\1;npdi!". 
    
   In this example, a regular expression replacement function is used to 
   reduce the size of the NAPTR record.  The tel URI uses “\1” which 
   would dynamically create a record with the TN from the original NAPTR 
   query, in this case +1-215-981-7813.

7. Implementation Recommendations 
    
   Software vendors consulted during development of this draft have 
   suggested that tel URIs may be easier and more efficient to use in 
   practice.  In addition, they have indicated that this will result in 
   somewhat smaller NAPTR records which, when considering adding 
   hundreds of millions of these records to the DNS, could have a 
   substantial impact on the processing and storage requirements for 
   service providers or other entities making use of this Enumservice 
   type. 
    
   In addition, it is likely that both E2U+sip and E2U+pstn Enumservice 
   type records will be returned for a given query.  Implementers should 
   take this into consideration and build logic into their applications 
   that can select appropriately from multiple records based on 
   business, network, or other rules. 
    
   It is also recommended that regular expressions be used, in order to 
   reduce the size of individual NAPTRs.  This will have a significant 
   effect on the overall size of the data involved.  Using the Section 
   6.5 example from above, this is 11 bytes per record.  Based on an 
   estimated 200 million records, this equates to approximately 2.1GB of 
   data.  In addition, where regular expressions are not used, the “-“ 
   hyphen delimiters in the URIs in the above section are shown in order 
   to make the numbers in each example more readable.  In practice, 
   however, including hyphens is not recommended as this also increases 
   the data storage requirements. 
    
8. Example of E2U+pstn in Call Processing 
    
   This is an example of how a switch, proxy, or other calling 
   application may make use of this Enumservice type during the call 
   initiation process. 
    
8.1 Dialed Number Not Available On-Net 
      a) A user, which is connected to a calling application, dials an 
         E.164 telephone number: 1-215-981-7813. 
      b) The calling application uses the dialed number to form a NAPTR 
         record: 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      c) The DNS finds an E2U+pstn:tel record and returns a tel URI for 
         processing by the calling application: tel:+1-215-981-
         7813;npdi. 
      d) The calling application uses routing logic to determine which 
         media gateway is the closest to this number and routes the 
         call appropriately. 
    
8.2 Dialed Number Available On-Net and on the PSTN 
      a) A user, which is connected to a calling application, dials an 
         E.164 telephone number: 1-215-981-7813.

Internet-Draft             PSTN Enumservice              December 2005 
 
 
      b) The calling application uses the dialed number to form a NAPTR 
         record: 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      c) The DNS finds both an E2U+pstn record, as well as an E2U+sip 
         record, since this number happens to be on the IP network of a 
         connected network. 
      d) The calling application prioritizes the on-net record first: 
         sip:+1-215-981-7813;npdi@gw.example.com;user=phone.   
      e) The calling application uses routing logic to determine which 
         proxy, router, session border controller, or other device to 
         use, and routes the call appropriately. 
      f) Should the IP call route fail for whatever reason, the calling 
         application may be able to utilize the E2U+pstn record to 
         invoke a fallback route to a media gateway that is connected 
         to the PSTN. 
 
9. Security Considerations 
    
   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Thus any 
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  While 
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone 
   Directory, it does open or ease access to such data without any 
   indication that such data has been accessed or by whom it has been 
   accessed. 
    
   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists 
   of targets for unsolicited information.  Thus, a third party could 
   use this to generate a list that they can use to make unsolicited 
   "telemarketing" phone calls.  Many countries have do-not-call 
   registries or other legal or regulatory mechanisms in place to deal 
   with such abuses.   
    
   Carriers, service providers, and other users may simply choose not to 
   publish such information in the public E164.ARPA tree, but may 
   instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM routing database 
   which is only able to be queried by trusted elements of their 
   network, such as softswitches and SIP proxy servers.  They may also 
   choose to publish such information in a carrier-only branch of the 
   E164.ARPA tree, should one be created. 
    
   Although an E.164 telephone number does not appear to reveal as much 
   identity information about a user as a name in the format 
   sip:username@hostname or email:username@hostname, the information is 
   still publicly available, thus there is still the risk of unwanted 
   communication. 
    
   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS 
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [13] to this is provided in RFC 3761 
   [1].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in 
   RFC 3833 [14].
