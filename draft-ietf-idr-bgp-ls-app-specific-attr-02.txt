   Application Specific Attributes Advertisement with BGP Link-State
               draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-app-specific-attr-02

Abstract

   Various link attributes have been defined in link-state routing
   protocols like OSPF and IS-IS in the context of the MPLS Traffic
   Engineering (TE) and GMPLS.  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions have
   been defined to distribute these attributes along with other topology
   information from these link-state routing protocols.  Many of these
   link attributes can be used for applications other than MPLS TE or
   GMPLS.

   Extensions to link-state routing protocols have been defined for such
   link attributes which enable distribution of their application
   specific values.  This document defines extensions to BGP-LS address-
   family to enable advertisement of these application specific
   attributes as a part of the topology information from the network.

1.  Introduction

   Various link attributes have been defined in link-state routing
   protocols (viz.  IS-IS [RFC1195], OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340] ) in the context of the MPLS traffic engineering and GMPLS.
   All these attributes are distributed by these protocols using TLVs
   that were originally defined for traditional MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (i.e. using RSVP-TE [RFC3209]) or GMPLS [RFC4202] applications.

   In recent years new applications have been introduced which have use
   cases for many of the link attributes historically used by RSVP-TE
   and GMPLS.  Such applications include Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402]
   and Loop Free Alternates (LFA) [RFC5286].  This has introduced

   ambiguity in that if a deployment includes a mix of RSVP-TE support
   and SR support (for example) it is not possible to unambiguously
   indicate which advertisements are to be used by RSVP-TE and which
   advertisements are to be used by SR.  If the topologies are fully
   congruent this may not be an issue, but any incongruence leads to
   ambiguity.  An additional issue arises in cases where both
   applications are supported on a link but the link attribute values
   associated with each application differ.  Current advertisements do
   not support advertising application specific values for the same
   attribute on a specific link.  IGP Flexible Algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] is one such application use-case that MAY
   use application specific link attributes.

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-link-attr-reuse] and [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app] define
   extensions for OSPF and IS-IS respectively which address these
   issues.  Also, as evolution of use cases for link attributes can be
   expected to continue in the years to come, these documents define a
   solution which is easily extensible to the introduction of new
   applications and new use cases.

   BGP Link-State extensions [RFC7752] have been specified to enable
   distribution of the link-state topology information from the IGPs to
   an application like a controller or Path Computation Engine (PCE) via
   BGP.  The controller/PCE gets the end to end topology information
   across IGP domains so it can perform path computations for use-cases
   like end to end traffic engineering (TE) using RSVP-TE or SR based
   mechanisms.  A similar challenge to what was describe above is hence
   also faced by such centralized computation entities.

   There is thus a need for BGP-LS extensions to also report link
   attributes on a per application basis on the same lines as introduced
   in the link-state routing protocols.  This document defines these
   BGP-LS extensions and also covers the backward compatibility issues
   related to existing BGP-LS deployments.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Application Specific Link Attributes TLV

   The BGP-LS [RFC7752] specifies the Link NLRI for advertisement of
   links and their attributes using the BGP-LS Attribute.  The
   Application Specific Link Attributes (ASLA) TLV is a new optional

   top-level BGP-LS Attribute TLV that is introduced for Link NLRIs.  It
   is defined such that it may act as a container for certain existing
   and future link attributes that require to be defined in an
   application specific scope.

   The format of this TLV is as follows and is similar to the
   corresponding ASLA sub-TLVs defined for OSPF and IS-IS in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-link-attr-reuse] and [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app]
   respectively.

   o  SABML : Standard Application Identifier Bit Mask Length in octets.
      The values MUST be 0, 4 or 8.  If the Standard Application

      set to 0.

   o  User Defined Application Identifier Bit-Mask : of size 0, 4 or 8
      octets as indicated by UDABML.  Optional set of bits, where each
      bit represents a single user defined application.  The bits are
      not managed or assigned by IANA or any other standards body and
      are left to implementation specifics.

   o  sub-TLVs : BGP-LS Attribute TLVs corresponding to the Link NLRI
      that are application specific (as specified in Section 3) are
      included as sub-TLVs of the ASLA TLV

   An ASLA TLV with both the SABML and UDABML set to 0 (i.e. without any
   application identifier bitmasks) indicates that the link attribute
   sub-TLVs that it encloses are applicable for all applications.

   The ASLA TLV and its sub-TLVs can only be added to the BGP-LS
   Attribute associated with the Link NLRI of the node that originates
   the underlying IGP link attribute TLVs/sub-TLVs.  The procedures for
   originating link attributes in the ASLA TLV from underlying IGPs is
   specified in Section 4.

   When the node is not running any of the IGPs but running a protocol
   like BGP, then the link attributes for the node's local links MAY be
   originated as part of the BGP-LS Attribute using the ASLA TLV and its
   sub-TLVs within the Link NLRI corresponding to the local node.

3.  Application Specific Link Attributes

   Several BGP-LS Attribute TLVs corresponding to the Link NLRI are
   defined in BGP-LS and more may be added in the future.  The following
   types of link attributes are required to be considered as application
   specific.

   o  those that have different values for different applications (e.g.
      a different TE metric value used for RSVP-TE than for SR TE)

   o  those that are applicable to multiple applications but need to be
      used only by specific application (e.g. certain SRLG values are
      configured on a node for LFA but the same do not need to be used
      for RSVP-TE)

   The following table lists the currently defined BGP-LS Attributes
   TLVs corresponding to Link NLRI which have application specific
   semantics.  They were originally defined with semantics for RSVP-TE
   and GMPLS applications.

     Table 1: BGP-LS Attribute TLVs also used as sub-TLVs of ASLA TLV

   All the BGP-LS Attribute TLVs defined in the table above are
   RECOMMENDED to be continued to be used at the top-level in the BGP-LS
   Attribute for carrying attributes specific to RSVP-TE without the use
   of the ASLA TLV.

   When a new link attribute is introduced, it may be thought of as
   being specific to only a single application.  However, down the line,
   it may be also shared by other applications and/or require
   application specific values.  In such cases, it is RECOMMENDED to err
   on the side of caution and define such attributes as application
   specific to ensure flexibility in the future.

   BGP-LS Attribute TLVs corresponding to Link NLRI that are defined in
   the future MUST specify if they are application specific and hence
   are REQUIRED to be encoded within an ASLA TLV.

   Only application specific link attributes need to be advertised
   within the ASLA TLV.  Link attributes which do not have application
   specific semantics SHOULD NOT be advertised within the ASLA TLV.
   Receivers SHOULD ignore any non-application specific attribute sub-
   TLVs within the ASLA TLV.

4.  Procedures

   The procedures described in this section apply to networks where all
   BGP-LS originators and consumers support this specification.  The
   backward compatibility aspects and operations in deployments where
   there are some BGP-LS originators or consumers that do not support
   this specification is described further in Section 6.

   The BGP-LS originator learns of the association of an application
   specific attribute to one or more set of applications from either the
   underlying IGP protocol LSA/LSPs from which it is sourcing the
   topology information or from the local node configuration when
   advertising attributes for the local node only.

   The association of an application specific link attribute with a
   specific application context when advertising attributes for the
   local node only (e.g. when running BGP as the only routing protocol)
   is an implementation specific matter and outside the scope of this
   document.

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-link-attr-reuse] and [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app] specify
   the mechanisms for flooding of application specific link attributes
   in OSPFv2/v3 and IS-IS respectively.  These IGP specifications also
   describe the backward compatibility aspects and the existing RSVP-TE/
   GMPLS specific TLV encoding mechanisms in respective protocols.

   A BGP-LS originator node which is sourcing link-state information
   from the underlying IGP determines the mechanism of flooding
   application specific link attributes based on the following rules:

   1.  Application specific link attributes received from an IGP node
       using existing RSVP-TE/GMPLS encodings MUST be encoded using the
       respective BGP-LS top-level TLVs listed in Table 1.

   2.  Application specific link attributes received from an IGP node
       using ASLA sub-TLV MUST be encoded in the BGP-LS ASLA TLV as sub-
       TLVs.

   3.  In case of IS-IS, the following specific procedures are to be
       followed:

Internet-Draft  BGP-LS Extns for App Specific Attributes        May 2020


       *  When application specific link attributes are received from a
          node with the L bit set in the ASLA sub-TLV AND application
          bits other than RSVP-TE are set in the application bitmasks
          then the application specific link attributes advertised in
          the corresponding legacy IS-IS TLVs/sub-TLVs MUST be encoded
          within the BGP-LS ASLA TLV as sub-TLVs with the application
          bits, other than the RSVP-TE bit, copied from the IS-IS ASLA
          sub-TLV.  The link attributes advertised in the legacy IS-IS
          TLVs/sub-TLVs are also advertised in BGP-LS top-level TLVs
          listed in Table 1.  Note this is true regardless of whether
          the RSVP-TE bit was set in the IS-IS ASLA TLV/sub-TLV.

       *  When the ASLA sub-TLV has the RSVP-TE application bit set then
          the link attributes from such an ASLA sub-TLV MUST be encoded
          using the respective BGP-LS top-level TLVs listed in Table 1.

       *  [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app] allows the advertisement of the Maximum
          Link Bandwidth within an ASLA sub-TLV even though it is not an
          application specific attribute.  However, when originating the
          Maximum Link Bandwidth into BGP-LS, the attribute MUST be
          encoded only in the top-level Maximum Link Bandwidth TLV 1089
          of BGP-LS and not within the BGP-LS ASLA TLV.

       *  [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app] also allows the advertisement of the
          Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth and the Unreserved Bandwidth
          within an ASLA sub-TLV even though these attributes are
          specific to RSVP-TE application.  However, when originating
          the Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth and Unreserved Bandwidth
          into BGP-LS, these attribute MUST be encoded only in the top-
          level Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth TLV 1090 and
          Unreserved Bandwidth TLV 1091 respectively of BGP-LS and not
          within the BGP-LS ASLA TLV.

   These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the
   advertisement for all application specific link attributes from the
   IGP nodes that support or do not support the ASLA extension.
   Furthermore, it also ensures that the top-level BGP-LS TLVs defined
   for RSVP-TE and GMPLS applications continue to be used for
   advertisement of their application specific attributes.

   A BGP-LS consumer node would normally get all application specific
   link attributes corresponding to RSVP-TE and GMPLS applications as
   existing top-level BGP-LS TLVs while for other applications they are
   encoded in ASLA TLV(s) with appropriate applicable bit mask setting.
   A BGP-LS consumer which implements this specification SHOULD prefer
   the application specific attribute value received via sub-TLVs within
   the ASLA TLV over the value received via the top level TLVs.

5.  Deployment Considerations

   SR-TE and LFA applications have been deployed in some networks using
   the IGP link attributes defined originally for RSVP-TE as discussed
   in [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-link-attr-reuse] and [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app].
   The corresponding BGP-LS top-level link attribute TLVs originally
   defined for RSVP-TE have also been similarly used for SR-TE and LFA
   applications by BGP-LS consumers.  Such usage MAY continue without
   requiring the support of the application specific link attribute
   encoding mechanism described in this document as long as the
   following conditions are met:

   o  The application is SRTE or LFA and RSVP-TE is not deployed
      anywhere in the network

   o  The application is SRTE or LFA, RSVP-TE is deployed in the
      network, and both the set of links on which SRTE and/or LFA
      advertisements are required and the attribute values used by SRTE
      and/or LFA on all such links is fully congruent with the links and
      attribute values used by RSVP-TE

6.  Backward Compatibility

   The backward compatibility aspects for BGP-LS are associated with the
   originators (i.e. nodes) and consumers (e.g.  PCE, controllers,
   applications, etc.) of the topology information.  BGP-LS
   implementations have been originating link attributes and consuming
   them without any application specific scoping prior to the extensions
   specified in this document.

   IGP backwards compatibility aspects associated with application
   specific link attributes for RSVP-TE, SRTE and LFA applications are
   discussed in the Backward Compatibility sections of
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-link-attr-reuse] and [I-D.ietf-isis-te-app].
   Although the backwards compatibility aspects ensure compatibility of
   IGP advertisements they also serve to ensure the backward
   compatibility of the BGP-LS advertisements used by BGP-LS consumers.
   In deployments where the BGP-LS originators or consumers do not
   support the extensions specified in this document, the IGPs need to
   continue to advertise link attributes intended for use by SRTE and
   LFA applications using the RSVP-TE/GMPLS encodings.  This allows BGP-
   LS advertisements to be consistent with the behaviour prior to the
   extensions defined in this document

   It is RECOMMENDED that the nodes which support this specification are
   selected as originators of BGP-LS information when sourcing the link-
   state information from the IGPs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning code-points from the registry "BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs" based on table below which reflects the values assigned via the
   early allocation process.  The column "IS-IS TLV/Sub-TLV" defined in
   the registry does not require any value and should be left empty.

   +------------+------------------------------------------+----------+
   | Code Point |         Description                      | Length   |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+----------+
   |   1122     | Application Specific Link Attributes TLV | variable |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+----------+


8.  Manageability Considerations

   This section is structured as recommended in [RFC5706].

   The new protocol extensions introduced in this document augment the
   existing IGP topology information that was distributed via [RFC7752].
   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP protocol operations and management other than as
   discussed in the Manageability Considerations section of [RFC7752].
   Specifically, the malformed NLRIs attribute tests in the Fault
   Management section of [RFC7752] now encompass the new TLVs for the
   BGP-LS NLRI in this document.

8.1.  Operational Considerations

   No additional operation considerations are defined in this document.

8.2.  Management Considerations

   No additional management considerations are defined in this document.

9.  Security Considerations

   The new protocol extensions introduced in this document augment the
   existing IGP topology information that was distributed via [RFC7752].
   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP security model other than as discussed in the Security
   Considerations section of [RFC7752].
