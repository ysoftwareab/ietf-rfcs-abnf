   Using CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
                Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
                      draft-tschofenig-tls-cwt-01

Abstract

   The TLS protocol supports different credentials, including pre-shared
   keys, raw public keys, and X.509 certificates.  For use with public
   key cryptography developers have to decide between raw public keys,
   which require out-of-band agreement and full-fletched X.509
   certificates.  For devices where the reduction of code size is
   important it is desirable to minimize the use of X.509-related
   libraries.  With the CBOR Web Token (CWT) a structure has been
   defined that allows CBOR-encoded claims to be protected with CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).

   This document registers a new value to the "TLS Certificate Types"
   sub-registry to allow TLS and DTLS to use CWTs.  Conceptually, CWTs
   can be seen as a certificate format (when with public key
   cryptography) or a Kerberos ticket (when used with symmetric key
   cryptography).

1.  Introduction

   The CBOR Web Token (CWT) [RFC8392] was defined as the CBOR-based
   version of the JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519].  JWT is used
   extensively on Web application and for use with Internet of Things

   environments the believe is that a more lightweight encoding, namely
   CBOR, is needed.  CWTs, like JWTs, contain claims and those claims
   are protected against modifications using COSE [RFC8152].  CWTs are
   flexible with regard to the use of cryptography and hence CWTs may be
   protected using a keyed message digest, or a digital signature.  One
   of the claims allows keys to be included, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  This specification makes use
   of these proof-of-possession claims in CWTs.  This document mandates
   a minimum number of claims to be present in a CWT.  There may,
   however, be a number of additional claims present in a CWT.  An
   example of a token with a larger number of claims is the Entity
   Attestation Token (EAT), which may also be encoded as a CWT.

   Fundamentally, there are two types of keys that can be used with
   CWTs:

   -  Asymmetric keys: In this case a CWT contains a COSE_Key [RFC8152]
      representing an asymmetric public key.  To protect the CWT against
      modifications the CWT also needs to be digitally signed.

   -  Symmetric keys: In this case a CWT contains the Encrypted_COSE_Key
      [RFC8152] structure representing a symmetric key encrypted to a
      key known to the recipient using COSE_Encrypt or COSE_Encrypt0.
      Again, to protect the CWT against modifications a keyed message
      digest is used.

   The CWT also allows mixing symmetric and asymmetric crypto although
   this is less likely to be used in practice.

   Exchanging CWTs in the TLS / DTLS handshake offers an alternative to
   the use of raw public keys and X.509 certificates.  Compared to raw
   public keys, CWTs allow more information to be included via the use
   of claims.  Compared to X.509 certificates CBOR offers an alternative
   encoding format, which may also be used by the application layer
   thereby potentially reducing the overall code size requirements.

        /* Managed by IANA */
         enum {
             X509(0),
             RawPublicKey(2),
             CWT(TBD),
             (255)
         } CertificateType;

         struct {
             select (certificate_type) {

                 /* CWT "certificate type" defined in this document.*/
                  case CWT:
                  opaque cwt_data<1..2^24-1>;

                  /* RawPublicKey defined in RFC 7250*/
                 case RawPublicKey:
                 opaque ASN.1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;

                 /* X.509 certificate defined in RFC 5246*/
                 case X.509:
                 opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;

                  };

                Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
         } CertificateEntry;

4.  Representation and Verification the Identity of Application Services

   RFC 6125 [RFC6125] provides guidance for matching identifiers used in
   X.509 certificates against a reference identifier, i.e. an identifier
   constructed from a source domain and optionally an application
   service type.  Different types of identifiers have been defined over
   time, such as CN-IDs, DNS-IDs, SRV-IDs, and URI-IDs, and they may be
   carried in different fields inside the X.509 certificate, such as in
   the Common Name or in the subjectAltName extension.

   For CWTs issued to servers the following rule applies: To claim
   conformance with this specification an implementation MUST populate
   the Subject claim with the value of the Server Name Indication (SNI)
   extension.  The Subject claim is of type StringOrURI.  If it is
   string an equality match is used between the Subject claim value and
   the SNI.  If the value contains a URI then the URI schema must be
   matched against the service being requested and the remaining part of
   the URI is matched against the SNI in an equality match (since the
   SNI only defines Hostname types).

   For CWTs issued to clients the application service interacting with
   the TLS/DTLS stack on the server side is responsible for
   authenticating the client.  No specific rules apply but the Subject
   and the Audience claims are likely to be good candidates for
   authorization policy checks.

   Note: Verification of the Not Before and the Expiration Time claims
   MUST be performed to determine the validity of the received CWT.

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   The security and privacy characteristics of this extension are best
   described in relationship to certificates (when asymmetric keys are
   used) and to Kerberos tickets (when symmetric keys are used) since
   the main difference is in the encoding.

   When creating proof-of-possession keys the recommendations for state-
   of-the-art key sizes and algorithms have to be followed.  For TLS/
   DTLS those algorithm recommendations can be found in [RFC7925] and
   [RFC7525].

   CWTs without proof-of-possession keys MUST NOT be used.

   When CWTs are used with TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] additional privacy properties are provided
   since most handshake messages are encrypted.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new value to the "TLS Certificate Types"
   sub-registry for CWTs.
