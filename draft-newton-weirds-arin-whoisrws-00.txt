               ARIN's RESTful Web Service for Whois Data
                  draft-newton-weirds-arin-whoisrws-00

Abstract

   This document describes the RESTful Web Service for Whois data as
   implemented and fielded by the American Registry for Internet Numbers
   (ARIN).  ARIN calls this service Whois-RWS.

   The purpose of this document is to facilitate discussion and serve as
   input into a standards process in this area, currently being
   discussed on the WHOIS-based Extensible Internet Registration Data
   Service (WEIRDS) mailing list
   (https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/weirds).

   Please excuse this very rough initial draft.  It is roughly based on
   information currently published on ARIN's website.  However, future
   revisions of this document are planned, including discussions on
   lessons learned by ARIN from the deployment of Whois-RWS and thoughts
   on a future, unified standard.

Internet-Draft  ARIN's RESTful Web Service for Whois Data      June 2011


2.  Background

   ARIN offers public access to ARIN registration data via a number of
   services.  Traditionally, these services are known in the industry as
   "Whois" in reference to the public data service of the ARPANET,
   precursor of today's modern Internet.  Whois services are offered by
   all the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), most Internet Routing
   Registries (IRRs) and most domain name registries and registrars.

   Traditionally, Whois services have been offered using the NICNAME/
   WHOIS protocol as described by RFC 954 and RFC 3912.  This protocol
   is a simple, text based TCP protocol registered with in the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for well-known port 43.  RFC 3912,
   the most recent specification for the protocol, does not define
   either data types or data formats.  As a consequence, Whois data
   varies from service provider to service provider and is far from
   ideal for programmatic consumption.

   ARIN provides to the general public services for read-only access to
   ARIN's registration data.  These services include a user-friendly web
   site (http://whois.arin.net), a RESTful Web Service, and a NICNAME/
   WHOIS port 43 service.  For the purposes of programmatic consumption,
   ARIN recommends the use of the RESTful Web Service and strongly
   discourages the use of the NICNAME/WHOIS port 43 service.

   This document describes the RESTful Web Service for ARIN's Whois
   data, which is known as Whois-RWS.

Internet-Draft  ARIN's RESTful Web Service for Whois Data      June 2011


3.  Data Model

   ARIN's Whois-RWS data model is composed of six first order objects:
   networks, autonomous system numbers, delegations, organizations,
   points of contact, and customers.  Each of these types, except
   delegations, is directly addressable in a Whois service via a handle
   (i.e. identifier).  Within the Whois RESTful Web Service, these
   handles are part of URLs that may be used to identify objects in
   ARIN's Whois registration database by external, non-ARIN systems.

3.1.  Networks and Autonomous System Numbers

   Networks and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) are collectively
   referred to as "resources" in ARIN parlance (this should not be
   confused with the term "resources" in the context of RESTful Web
   Services and Resource Oriented Architectures).  They are the pieces
   of information assigned or allocated to organizations for the
   coordinated administration and operation of the Internet.

   Networks signify the allocation or assignment of IP address space and
   the contiguous IP CIDR blocks that make up that IP address space.
   Handles for IPv4 networks start with "NET-", and handles for IPv6
   networks start with "NET6-".

   Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) are used for the proper routing of
   Internet packets.  ARIN assigns ASNs in ranges, therefore a single
   ASN is part of an ASN range allocation.  The handles for these
   registrations start with "AS" and are usually appended with the first
   number of the ASN range.

3.2.  Delegations

   Delegations contain the information necessary for Reverse DNS,
   including the associated nameservers, and DNS DS record information.
   Unlike the other first order objects, delegations do not have a
   Handle.  Rather, they are directly addressable in a Whois service via
   a delegation name (i.e. 0.192.in-addr.arpa.).

3.3.  Organizations and Customers

   Organizations are the registrants of resources and have a direct
   relationship with ARIN.  Organizations may be associated with many
   resources.  Customers do not have a direct relationship with ARIN
   and, at present, may only be associated with one network
   registration.

   Customer handles start with "C", while organization handles have no
   prefix.

Internet-Draft  ARIN's RESTful Web Service for Whois Data      June 2011


3.4.  Points of Contact

   A Point of Contact (POC) is the registration of names, mailboxes,
   and/or phone numbers which fulfill technical or administrative
   functions on behalf of either an organization or a resource.  POC
   handles are usually appended with "-ARIN" though there are a few
   exceptions.

3.5.  General Query Behavior

   For the first order objects addressable via handle, ARIN's Whois
   services also allow for searching against names and other appropriate
   fields contained within those objects.  Unless otherwise specified,
   these searches are case insensitive.  Because ARIN's networks are
   composed of multiple CIDR based network blocks, searches by IP
   address or CIDR notation may sometimes yield what may, at first
   blush, appear incorrect.  For instance, a search for a particular
   CIDR block may yield a network that covers the given CIDR block and
   additional CIDR blocks composing the network, while a search by an IP
   address will always yield the network or networks in which the IP
   address falls.

4.  Use of REST over HTTP

4.1.  Data Formats and Versions

   RESTful web services are not strictly tied to XML.  ARIN's Whois
   RESTful Web Service offers data in XML, JSON, plain text, and HTML
   (actually, XHTML).  However, ARIN's first order data format is XML as
   there are many format and validation tools readily available for it,
   and the other formats are offered on a best-effort basis.

   If no desired format is specified, XML is the default format.

   Specifying a desired data format may be accomplished in one of two
   ways: either using the HTTP Accept header or using "file extensions".
   A "file extension" appends a DOS like file extension to the path.

   Though there only exists one version of this RESTful interface, it is
   possible that the "data model" of the structured data such as XML and
   JSON that is output by this service will need revision.  Should it be
   possible for ARIN to provide a backward compatible version, the HTTP
   Accept header is the mechanism for specifying the desired version as
   well as the data format.

   The MIME type used in the Accept header will follow the format of
   "application/arin.whoisrws-{version}+{format}".  To use the latest
   version of this service you would simply use the default MIME types
   of "application/xml" or "application/json".

    The following table lists the data types and their associated MIME
                        types and file extensions.

   +------+----------------+-------------------------------+-----------+
   | Data |     Current    |      Version 1 MIME Type      |    File   |

4.3.  Resource Oriented URLs

   URLs point to resources.  A typical URL might be
   http://whois.arin.net/rest/poc/ALN-ARIN, which is a URL pointing to
   the author of this document.  Conceptually, this can be broken into a
   base URL and the resource identifier:

   base URL:  http://whois.arin.net/rest

   resource:  /poc/ALN-ARIN

   The base URL is just where ARIN is hosting the service.  The real
   interesting parts are the bits that identify the resources:

   /poc  this indicates the resource is a Point of Contact.

   /ALN-ARIN  this is the unique identifier for the Point of Contact, or
      the POC Handle.

   The Whois-RWS data model has six types of addressable resources.
   These are reflected in Whois-RWS in the following way:

   /poc  point of contact

   /org  organization

   /net  a network

   /asn  autonomous system number(s)

   /customer  a customer of an organization

   /rdns  delegations in the reverse DNS

4.3.1.  Resources Related to Resources

   In the ARIN Whois data model, resources have relationships to other
   resources.  Getting references to these resources can be accomplished
   by addressing the resource in question and applying a resource type
   qualifier.

   Here is the list of relationships (where "XXXX" signifies a handle):

   /poc/XXXX

      /orgs (i.e. /poc/XXXX/orgs)  lists the organizations associated
         with a given POC

      /asns (i.e. /poc/XXXX/asns)  lists the autonomous system numbers
         associated with a given POC

      /nets (i.e. /poc/XXXX/nets)  lists the networks associated with a
         given POC

   /org/XXXX

      /pocs (i.e. /org/XXXX/pocs)  lists the points of contact
         associated with a given organization

      /asns (i.e. /org/XXXX/asns)  lists the autonomous system numbers
         associated with a given organization

      /nets (i.e. /org/XXXX/nets)  lists the networks associated with a
         given organization

   /asn/XXXX

      /pocs (i.e. /asn/XXXX/pocs)  lists the points of contact
         associated with a given autonomous system number

   /net/XXXX

      /pocs (i.e. /net/XXXX/pocs)  lists the points of contact
         associated with a given network

      /parent (i.e. /net/XXXX/parent)  lists the parnet network of a
         given network

      /children (i.e. /net/XXXX/children)  lists the child networks
         associated with a given network

      /rdns (i.e. /net/XXXX/rdns)  lists the reverse DNS delegations
         associated with a given network

   /rdns/XXXX

      /nets (i.e. /rdns/XXXX/nets)  lists the networks associated with a
         given reverse DNS delegation

4.3.2.  Unrelated Lists of Resources

   Unrelated lists of resources may be addressed using URL matrix
   parameters.  As an example, to find organizations with the name
   "ARIN", the /orgs list is appended with the matrix parameter name to
   form /orgs;name=ARIN (this is without the base URL).

   Here is the list of resources and their supported matrix parameters:

   /orgs

      handle  the handle of the organization

      name  the name of the organization

      dba  the "doing-business-as" name of the organization

   /customers

      handle  the handle of the customer

      name  the name of the customer

   /pocs

      handle  the handle of the POC

      domain  the domain name of an email address of the POC

      first  the first name of the POC

      middle  the middle name of the POC

      last  the last name of the POC

      company  the company name registered by the POC

      city  the city registered by the POC

   /asns

      handle  the handle of the autonomous system number

      name  the name of the autonomous system number

   /nets

      handle  the handle of the network

      name  the name of the network

4.3.3.  IP Addresses

   In the ARIN data model, an IP "network" is a set of associated IP
   address blocks and the information related to these IP address blocks
   and the set as a whole.  A network can be composed of one IP address
   block or of multiple IP address blocks.  Networks are also
   hierarchical, meaning that a network can have a parent and can have
   children.  An IP address or range of IP addresses can therefore fall
   within the IP address block of multiple networks.

   To get the networks that a particular IP address may fall within, one
   can use the /ip/XX.XX.XX.XX resource, where XX.XX.XX.XX signifies the
   IP address.

   Networks may be looked up as well by supplying the full CIDR notation
   of a range.  To use the full CIDR notation, the resource looks like
   /cidr/XX.XX.XX.XX/YY where XX.XX.XX.XX is the IP address prefix and
   YY is the CIDR length.

   Resources relative to the networks may be fetched using the /less and
   /more path prefixes. /less will find the networks that are less
   specific in scope (or wider), and /more will find the networks that
   are more specific in scope (or narrower).

4.3.4.  Aggregate Resources

   Though Whois-RWS breaks down the ARIN data model into distinct
   resources, end users have been accustomed to seeing many related
   resources with one query over the NICNAME/WHOIS port 43 service.
   While this can be accomplished by any Whois-RWS clients with multiple
   queries, an aggregate resources can reduce the number of queries and
   make this use case easier on client implementers.

   For resources under /org, /net, /asn, and /ip, the URL may be

   appended with "/pft" to produce an aggregate resource which includes
   the resource being queried and related resources.  If you can guess
   what /pft means, I'll buy you a beer.

4.3.5.  Query Parameters

4.3.5.1.  Showing More of Detail

   By default, lists of resources only show references to the resources.
   However, lists can be expanded to show full detail by tacking on a
   showDetails=true URL query parameter
   (e.g.http://whois.arin.net/rest/org/ARIN/pocs?showDetails=true).
   This query parameter also forces a resource to list its related
   resources in line.

4.3.5.2.  Showing Only Points of Contact

   Some organizations have many, many associated resources.  Having all
   those resources returned when gathering information about an
   organization maybe very undesirable.  To allow getting all the POCs
   of an organization without taking the penalty of retrieving all the
   resources of the organization, the showPocs=true parameter may be
   used.  This parameter is only recognized when an organization's
   information is referenced by handle.

4.3.5.3.  Showing ARIN Resources

   In the past, ARIN's NICNAME/WHOIS service yielded a "No Match" result
   for searches of IP address space unallocated by ARIN but within
   ARIN's IP address pool.  This was somewhat confusing and could
   possibly mislead a person into thinking the address space is simply
   unallocated to any available address pool (in other words, still held
   by the IANA).  This has been changed in ARIN's NICNAME/WHOIS service
   so it will return the appropriate ARIN network allocation for IP
   addresses unallocated by ARIN.  By default, the RESTful service will
   also return the appropriate ARIN network allocation for IP addresses
   unallocated by ARIN to ARIN constituents.

   If the behavior is desired, the showARIN=false query parameter may be
   used on IP and CIDR queries.

5.  HTTP Caching

   One of the advantages of a RESTful Web Service is that HTTP
   infrastructure may be employed to make it more reliable and/or
   robust.  HTTP caching is one such tool to help with these goals.
   ARIN employs caching at multiple levels and customized to address the
   query pattern seen against ARIN's services.

   If HTTP caching is be employed on the client side, there are a number
   of issues to consider to craft a custom caching solution.

   First caching should be restricted to URLs that have the highest
   likelihood of remaining in the cache using the caches retention
   strategy.  In almost any scenario, caching RESTful resources under
   /rest/ip will lead to a large dataset and a low cache hit ratio.
   However, it is likely acceptable to cache resources under /rest/org,
   /rest/poc, and /rest/net.  It is recommended that cache statistics be
   available for proper cache tuning.

   Second, many HTTP caches base the cache objects on URLs.  However,
   the Accept header dictates the content of the object and may not be
   part of the cache key of cached objects.  Therefore it is possible to
   get a cached object of one type when another type was requested.  For
   instance, /rest/poc/KOSTE-ARIN might return XML when JSON was
