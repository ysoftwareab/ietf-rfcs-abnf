1.  Introduction

   IETF Hackathons encourage developers to collaborate and develop
   utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical
   implementations of IETF standards.  IETF Hackathons aim to:

   o  Advance the pace and relevance of IETF standards activities by
      bringing the speed and collaborative spirit of open source
      development into the IETF

   o  Bring developers and young people into IETF and get them exposed
      to and interested in IETF

   IETF Hackathons are free to attend and open to everyone.  They are
   collaborative events, not competitions.  Any competitiveness among
   participants is friendly, and in the spirit of advancing the pace and
   relevance of new and evolving internet standards.

   This document provides a set of practices for running IETF
   Hackathons.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Funding

   The Hackathon requires funding, and that funding increases with the
   number of participants.  Participating has always been free;
   therefore, funding from other sources than participant fees is
   required.

3.1.  Sponsorship

   The initial funding model was to have Hackathon sponsors that sign up
   to sponsor and fund the Hackathon for one year.  As part of starting
   the Hackathon, Cisco volunteered to sponsor and fund the Hackathon
   for its first year (i.e,. three Hackathons, one at each IETF meeting
   during a calendar year).  This sponsorship was to rotate.  Huawei
   volunteered to sponsor the second year of the Hackathon.  After the
   second year, a sponsor for the 3rd year was not found.  However, the
   Hackathon had become a proven success.  Consequently, the IETF
   decided to fund the Hackathon as part of the IETF meeting, with
   Hackathon sponsorship being on a best effort basis.

3.2.  Expenses

   The primary costs associated with the Hackathon are for the meeting
   space and for food and beverage.  It is often challenging to separate
   out the cost of the Hackathon.

3.2.1.  Space

   The space for the Hackathon is sometimes included as part of the
   overall contract.  Other times, additional costs are incurred to
   secure a large enough space earlier than would otherwise have been
   required.  Typically, the space is needed from Friday afternoon for
   setup until Sunday afternoon.  The space is typically repurposed for
   the IETF Lounge.  If the size of the Hackathon continue to increase,
   it might be necessary to use the same space as is used for the IETF
   plenary.

3.2.2.  Food and Beverage

   Some portion of the food and beverage cost is often included as part
   of a minimum spend the IETF is obligated to make.  When a Hackathon
   sponsor is identified, the money is typically used to offset food and
   beverage costs, or to enhance the food and beverage that is made
   available versus what would have been made available if no sponsor
   existed.

   The minimum food and beverage for the Hackathon has been,

Internet-Draft               ietf-hackathon                November 2020


   o  coffee, tea, and water Saturday and Sunday morning

   o  lunch Saturday and Sunday

   Additional items, in order of importance, included when funding is
   available include,

   o  beer Saturday evening

   o  dinner Saturday evening

   o  continental breakfast Saturday and Sunday

   o  afternoon snacks Saturday and Sunday

3.2.3.  T-shirts

   Hackathon t-shirts are an important part of the Hackathon.  They have
   been provided for all in-person Hackathons and greatly appreciated by
   most participants.  The also serve as great advertising for the IETF,
   the Hackathon, and sponsors.  Cisco or other event sponsors have
   typically covered the cost of t-shirts.  The current model is that
   the secretariat covers the costs using whatever funding is available.

   TBD: include size and cost info?

3.2.4.  Stickers

   Laptop stickers are popular with software developers.  Stickers have
   been produced made available at the Hackathon for those that want
   them.  The cost of producing these and making them available has been
   covered by the IETF LLC, Director of Communications and Operations.

3.2.5.  Online only

   When the IETF meeting has been online only, all costs in this section
   are eliminated.  Some potential costs associated with running the
   Hackathon online an entire week before the rest of the IETF meeting
   include the following:

   o  Meetecho: costs associated with Hackathon kickoff and and closing
      sessions on Monday and Friday.

   o  Gather: costs associated with premium service, required to enable
      more than 50 concurrent users.  This has not been necessary, but
      will almost certainly be if Gather becomes a valuable way for
      Hackathon participants to meet within and across teams.

Internet-Draft               ietf-hackathon                November 2020


   o  Webex: IETF Webex accounts are made available to champions for the
      duration of the Hackathon and some period beyond that encompasses
      at least the rest of the IETF meeting.  These accounts are at
      present available at no additional cost to the IETF.

   o  Network: the IETF network, and remote access to it, need to be
      available an additional week.

4.  Timing

   The first IETF Hackathon was held the weekend before the start of the
   IETF 92 meeting.  The rationale was to avoid conflicts yet make it
   relatively convenient for those attending the IETF meeting to
   participate in the Hackathon as well.  Holding the Hackathon on the
   weekend was also viewed as making it more accessible to non IETF
   meeting attendees, including students and working professionals who
   would have other commitments during the week.  The weekend before was
   viewed as better than the weekend after such that things learned
   during the Hackathon could be shared and discussed with the rest of
   the IETF community during working group sessions and the like.  This
   worked well at IETF 92, was repeated at IETF 93, and quickly became
   an established norm with the IETF meeting being officially extended
   to include the Hackathon at the start.

4.1.  Agenda

   The IETF Hackathon is a strenuous event.  Though not a competition,
   participants want to make the most of their time together, much as
   with the IETF meeting in general.  Competitive Hackathons typically
   run non-stop for on the order of 40 hours.  There is a strict
   deadline and teams are judged and winners declared at the end.
   Afterward everyone is wiped out and heads off to briefly celebrate or
   commiserate, but mainly to recuperate.  As the IETF Hackathon serves
   as the start of the overall IETF meeting, we aim to strike a
   compromise that provides enjoy time to get valuable work accomplished
   without exhausting themselves before the main IETF meeting even
   starts.  While some people participate in the Hackathon only, the
   majority of people remain and plan to be actively engaged in the rest
   of the IETF meeting.

   The typical agenda is as follows:

   Saturday before IETF meeting week
       08:30: Room open for setup by project champions
       09:00: Room open for all - Pastries and coffee provided
       09:30: Hackathon kickoff
       09:45: Form Teams
       12:30: Lunch provided
       15:30: Afternoon break - Snacks provided
       19:00: Dinner provided
       22:00: Room closes

   Sunday before IETF meeting week
       08:30: Room opens - Pastries and coffee provided
       12:30: Lunch provided
       13:30: Hacking stops, prepare brief presentation of project
       14:00: Project presentations to other participants
       15:45: Closing remarks and opportunities for next time
       16:00: Hackathon ends
       17:00: Tear down complete

   The time on Saturday morning provides team champions time to setup
   and participants time to socialize and learn more about projects and
   team they might want to join.  The kickoff presentation and
   formalities are kept to minimum to leave as much time as possible for
   team to work together with their team on their projects.  The
   proximity of teams to each other fosters communication and
   collaboration across teams as well.

   Lunch and dinner are provided as a convenience and an incentive to
   remain at the Hackathon.  Participants are free to come and go as
   they like.  It is well understood and accepted that there are other
   things vying for time and that meeting with friends or colleagues
   outside of the Hackathon is an entirely reasonable thing to do.

   The room closes Saturday evening to give hotel staff unfettered
   access to the room and to encourage people to pace and take care of
   themselves.  There are no rules against continuing work on Hackathon
   projects outside of the Hackathon room.  Similarly, working on
   projects long before and after the Hackathon is allowed and
   encouraged.

   The end of the Hackathon on Sunday is driven by other IETF meeting
   events.  There typically are Newcomer events that start at 16:00.
   The IETF Hackathon typically includes many newcomers in its list of
   participants.  It is important to provide them time to participate in
   the Newcomer events.  The opening reception typically start at 17:00,
   and we want to make it easy for all Hackathon participants to join
   that as well.

   Hackdemo Happy Hour (ref) and the Code Lounge (ref) exist to
   facilitate ongoing discussion and work on projects beyond the
   official end of the Hackathon weekend.

4.2.  Hackdemo Happy Hour

   Hackdemo Happy Hour provides an opportunity for more in depth sharing
   and discussion than is possible within the time constraints of the
   result presentation that occur at the end of the Hackathon.  This
   opportunity is made available to all teams.  As with the results
   presentation, participation is optional.

   Initially, we did something similar as part of Bits and Bites.  This
   worked well for the Hackathon but the Bits and Bites event was
   eventually abandoned for other reasons.  Hackdemo Happy Hour was
   created as a low cost, informal event to provide a venue for the IETF
   community to engage with the Hackathon teams in more in depth
   discussions related to their projects.

   Hackdemo Happy Hour is typically Monday evening, roughly from 18:00 -
   19:30, often overlapping a bit with the last working group session of
   the day but continuing long enough to allow everyone an opportunity
   to join.  The goal is to make it convenient to attend by not
   conflicting with other meetings but also no running too late into the
   night.

   Light snacks and non alcoholic beverages are provided, and a cash bar
   is available to align with the spirit of a happy hour.

4.3.  Code Lounge

   The Code Lounge provides space for groups to gather and continue to
   collaborate on running code after the Hackathon.  It is typically in
   the IETF Lounge and open the same hours as the IETF Lounge.
   Champions are encouraged to look at the final agenda and determine
   time slots best suited to ensure successful attendance of Code Lounge
   sessions as well as any traditional working group sessions.  It is
   okay for multiple teams to sign up for the same time slots.  This is
   in fact encouraged for work that spans multiple working groups or
   projects.

4.4.  Code Sprint

   Some efforts were made to have the Hackathon and the Code Sprint work
   together or potentially be combined into a single event focusing on
   the development of IETF protocols and IETF internal tools.  There is
   some concern that the events currently compete for resources.  There
   is also a great deal of synergistic potential.  Several Hackathon

Internet-Draft               ietf-hackathon                November 2020


   projects, such as those related to YANG model validation, involve the
   creation or modification of IETF tools.

   The Code Sprint existed long before the Hackathon and has its own
   identity and way of doing things.  The Code Sprint organizers are
   against combining the events and potentially losing this identity the
   benefits of a customized event.  The practice that exists today is to
   locate the events physically close to each other to facilitate
   switching back and forth between the two events.

4.5.  Online Only

   IETF 107 Hackathon was originally scheduled to be the weekend at the
   start of the IETF meeting in Vancouver.  When COVID-19 hit and it
   became clear the IETF meeting could not occur in person, the
   Hackathon already had 23 projects and 176 registrations.  With only
   10 days until the anticipated start of the Hackathon, a survey went
   out to the Hackathon community, including all project champions and
   registered participants, to see if they wanted to participate in the
   Hackathon exactly as planned except with everyone participating
   remotely rather than in person.  A relatively small number of people
   expressed interest in participating, with even fewer wanting to
   continue to champion their projects.  The fact that the Hackathon was
   planned for the weekend before the IETF meeting and in the local time
   zone, both of which were historically very convenient and attractive
   to Hackathon participants, suddenly became huge obstacles.
   Consequently, the IETF 107 Hackathon was cancelled.

   We knew more in advance that IETF 108 would be an online only
   meeting.  We moved and expanded the schedule to run the entire work
   week before the rest of the IETF meeting.  The Hackathon kickoff was
   set for Monday, the closing for Friday, with all the time in between
   left for individual project teams to arrange to meet how and when was
   most convenient for them.  The kickoff and closing sessions were
   schedule to align with the time frame established for the IETF 108
   meeting.  All of this was, of course, not ideal, and it worked much
   better for some people than for others, but at least everyone knew
   the plan and corresponding time commitment well in advance and had
   the ability to plan accordingly.

   The response was great.  We ultimately had 19 projects and almost 300
   registrations.  It is hard to say how many people actually
   participated and for how long, but many projects were able to get
   substantial work done.  For the closing, 10 teams produced and shared
   presentations summarizing their findings and achievements.  All
   presentations as well as the agenda and a recording of the closing
   session are available via the IETF 108 Hackathon

   Hackdemo Happy Hour and the Code Lounge are not applicable for online
   only Hackathons.

5.  Project Presentations

   Project presentations are an important mechanism for capturing what
   each team accomplished and sharing this with the IETF community.

   For the first few Hackathons, we had two very distinct types of
   presentations,

   1.  Presentation that served as project pitches at the start of the
       Hackathon

   2.  Presentations that summarizes results at the end of the
       Hackathon.

5.1.  Project Pitches

   The project pitches were 5-10 minute presentations by a champion of a
   project describing what they wanted to do and how they proposed to
   accomplish it.  This gave everyone in the room a better understanding
   of all the projects and helped participants match themselves with
   appropriate projects.  This was fantastic when we had a small number
   of projects, but it became unwieldy as the number of projects
   increased.  As knowledge of the Hackathon grew and advanced planning
   became more common, many participants knew exactly which team they
   planned to join and wanted to get to work as quickly as possible
   rather than spend a couple hours listening to presentations.  Project
   pitches were dropped from the Hackathon.  Champions are encouraged to
   share this type of information in advance via the Meeting Wiki
   instead.

5.2.  Results Summaries

   The project presentations are brief summaries by each team of what
   problem they tried to solve, what they achieved, and highlights that
   include lessons learned, feedback to associated working groups, and
   collaboration with open source communities and other standards
   organizations.  We also highlight individuals who are participating
   in their first IETF Hackathon or first IETF event to facilitate their
   introduction into the IETF community.  The production and
   presentation of results summaries is optional.  Fortunately, despite
   the lack of awards and prizes, most teams participate.

   As with the project pitches, results presentations can become
   unwieldy as the number of projects increases.  The formula used is to

Internet-Draft               ietf-hackathon                November 2020


   limit the total time for all presentations to 2 hours and allocate
   time slots based on that.  Time slots of minutes are typical.

   All presentation are uploaded to a GitHub repo created specifically
   for each IETF Hackathon (e.g., https://github.com/ietf-hackathon/
   ietf108-project-presentations [1].

   The contents of this repo are used as the source for all project
   presentations at the end of the Hackathon and remain as a reference
   after the Hackathon.  For portability, presentations are requested to
   be in PDF format.

   One must be a member of the IETF-Hackathon GitHub org to upload a new
   presentation or update/replace an existing presentation.

   To be added as a member, presenters are asked to

   o  include the name by which they are known in their GitHub profile

   o  enable two factor authentication (2FA)

   o  send your GitHub user name to the Chair(s)

   Presenters are asked to do this at their earliest convenience as the
   Chair(s) typically get very busy as the start of presentations
   approaches.

5.2.1.  Presenting in person

   Presentations are run from a shared ChromeBook at the front of the
   Hackathon room.  This Chromebook is provided by the Secretariat.

5.2.2.  Presenting Remotely

   Remote presenters are welcome to run their own presentations using
   the screen sharing functionality in Meetecho.  Alternatively, the
   Hackathon chairs can share the presentation and advance slides for
   the presenter.

6.  Tooling

   The IETF Hackathon makes use of the same tooling used by the IETF
   community for its work and meetings.

6.1.  Datatracker

   The Datatracker [2] supports the notion of Teams that are not a part
   of the standards development process.  The Hackathon exists as one
   such Team.  From the Datatracker menu, navigate to "Other", "Active
   Teams", "Hackathon".  Here exists a Datatracker space for the
   Hackathon similar to what is available for working groups, including
   meeting materials, agendas, etc.  Initially, there was some attempt
   to copy materials hosted in GitHub [3] to the Datatracker.  Now this
   is done only when required for integration with other IETF tooling,
   including:

   o  requesting sessions [4] for the Hackathon kickoff and closing, and
      for Hackdemo Happy Hour

   o  posting agendas [5]

6.2.  IETF Website

6.2.1.  Hackathon Webpage

   The IETF website includes a dedicated page for the Hackathon webpage
   [6].  This page contains information about the Hackathon in general
   as well as links to past, present, and future Hackathons.  The
   relevant links are updated after each IETF meeting.  Other content on
   the page is updated on a more ad hoc basis.

6.2.2.  Meeting Webpage

   Each IETF meeting webpage [7] contains information about the
   corresponding Hackathon, including the dates of the Hackathon in the
   header, a link to the Hackathon webpage in the "Additional Events"
   section.

6.3.  Registration

   Registration for the Hackathon is through the IETF meeting
   registration [8] system.  Participant registration for the Hackathon
   is

   o  independent of participation registration for the meeting

   o  free

   o  required

   As with meeting registration, registrants for the Hackathon
   acknowledge the Note Well [9] during the registration process.

Internet-Draft               ietf-hackathon                November 2020


6.3.1.  Attendees List

   An active list of all registered attendees (e.g.
   https://registration.ietf.org/109/participants/Hackathon/) is
   maintained by the Secretariat.  Important information displayed for
   each registrants include the set of projects and technologies in
   which each participant is interested and an email address.  This
   information is optional at the time of registration and may be
   updated or removed by editing ones registration.

6.3.2.  Caps on Registrations

   Registrations were capped for the first several Hackathons.  This was
   done both for space and costs considerations.  The cap was hit
   multiple times, each time resulting in temporary confusion and
   frustration among would be registrants, followed by the cap being
   increased.  Currently, there are no caps enforced by the registration
   system.

6.4.  Wiki

   The meeting wiki serves as the primary source of information for each
   Hackathon.

6.4.1.  Hackathon

   A page within the wiki is created by the Secretariat for each
   Hackathon and initialized with information that is based largely on
   the information from the previous Hackathon.  Once created, the
   Hackathon Chairs update and moderate the wiki.  Champions are
   requested and responsible for adding information about projects for
   which they are a champion.

   Anyone can edit the wiki by logging in using their Datatracker login
   credentials.  Credentials can be obtained by requesting [10] a new
   Datatracker account.

6.4.2.  Lost and Found

   A Lost and Found wiki page (e.g.
   https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/109Hackathon/lost&found)
   is created by the Chairs for each Hackathon.  Participants looking
   for a team are encouraged to add themselves to the "Skills to Offer"
   table, providing some information about their skills and interests.
   This will help others with matching needs and/or interests find them.
   Champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to add their
   teams to the "Skills Needed" table, providing some information about
   the skills they seek.

6.4.3.  In Person Only

   The following wiki pages are applicable for in-person Hackathons
   only.

6.4.3.1.  Hackdemo Happy Hour

   A Hackdemo Happy Hour wiki page (e.g.
   https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/106hackdemo) is created
   by the Chairs for each Hackathon.  Champions are welcome and
   encouraged to add their project by entering the project name/acronym
   and a contact name and email address in the table displayed on the
   page.

6.4.3.2.  Code Lounge

   A Code Lounge wiki page (e.g.
   https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/106codelounge) is
   created by the Chairs for each Hackathon.  Champions are welcome and
   encouraged to add their project by entering the project name/acronym
   and a contact name and email address in the table displayed on the
   page.

6.4.4.  Online Only

   The following wiki pages are applicable for online only Hackathons
   only.

6.4.5.  Team Schedule

   A Team Schedule wiki page (e.g.
   https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/109Hackathon/
   teamschedule) is created by the Chairs for each online only
   Hackathon.  Online only Hackathons take place globally for an entire
   week.  It is up to individual project teams to determine the
   preferred dates, times, and ways to meet to work on their project
   within the context of that week (e.g.  Zoom, Webex, Slack).  This
   page is meant to help facilitate coordination of schedules within and
   across teams.

6.5.  Mailing List

   The Hackathon mail list, hacakthon@ietf.org [11], is used for all
   email communication and announcement related to the Hackathon.  All
   registrants and given the option to subscribe to the list.  Anyone
   interested in staying up to date on the Hackathon is able to
   subscribe at any time.

6.6.  GitHub

   The IETFHackathon [12] is used to share code, presentations, and
   other artifacts at IETF Hackathons.  The Hackathon Chairs are
   responsible for administering the GitHub org.

   Code for Hackathon projects often exist elsewhere, which is perfectly
   fine.  Anyone needing a place to host code for the Hackathon can
   request the creating of a repository for their project.

   A repository is created and maintained by the Chairs for each
   Hackathon (e.g. https://github.com/ietf-hackathon/ietf109-project-
   presentations).  This repo is for participants to upload project
   presentations.  The contents of this repo are used as the source for
   all project presentations at the end of the Hackathon and remain as a
   reference after the Hackathon.

6.7.  Meetecho

   Meetecho [13] is used for the kickoff and closing sessions of the
   Hackathon.  This provides many capabilities, including the following:

   o  allows participants to join Hackathon sessions in person or
      remotely

   o  validate registration of participants at time of joining Hackathon
      sessions

   o  enable remote presentations of project results

   o  capture recording of Hackathon sessions

6.8.  Network

   Access to the IETF network is an important aspect of the Hackathon.
   The IETF network provides unfettered internet access that is not
   typical within many residential, corporate, and university
   environments.  For many of IETF participants and projects, access to
   the internet and each other via the wireless access to the IETF
   network is sufficient.  However, due to the nature of the work done
   in the IETF, wired access and special networking capabilities are
   often required.

   The NOC has graciously met the needs of the Hackathon since its
   inception and continues to add more capabilities over time.
   Champions are able to request in advance wired access and special
   networking functionality, including static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
   IPv6 only networking, a closed user group, NAT64, and IPv6PD.  All of

Internet-Draft               ietf-hackathon                November 2020


   this, and the IETF network in general, is made available by the start
   of the Hackathon and in advance for setup to the extent possible.

6.8.1.  Remote Networking

   Online only meetings present not only a personal networking challenge
   but a computer networking challenge as well.  The NOC came to the
   rescue with remote networking options to join the IETF network while
   attending the meeting remotely.  With a Raspberry Pi [14] 2 or newer,
   or MikroTik hAP mini [15], the NOC has a recipe that allow teams to
   be virtually connected to the IETF network with all the previously
   mentioned options.  Best of all, this same remote networking
   capability can be used by remote and in-person participants of
   Hackathons at in-person meetings.

6.9.  Online Only

   The following tooling is applicable for online only Hackathons only.

6.9.1.  Webex

   Webex accounts are applicable for online only Hackathons only.

   Champions can request a Webex account [16] they can use to schedule
   meetings for their team.  These are similar to the Webex accounts
   allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim
   meetings.  An account can be requested by a team champion at any
   time.  Accounts remain active and available throughout the duration
   of the Hackathon and the associated IETF meeting.  A project name may
   be used in place of "Working Group Name" in the request form.

6.9.2.  Gather

   Gather [17] is applicable for online only Hackathons.  A dedicated
   area of the space is created by the Secretariat.  The area includes
   tables that are assigned to teams.  Seats around the table facilitate
   group discussions within the team.  A whiteboard at each table
   facilitates sharing of information within the team.  The tables also
   provide a mechanism to collaboration across teams.

7.  Statistics and Metrics

   Metrics have been captured for each Hackathon.  Adding these metrics
   is on the todo list.

   TBD.  Should this info be in its own section or inline within other
   sections?  It is known to be incomplete and a mix of own section and
   inline at the moment.

8.1.  Hackathon Chair(s)

   The role of a Hackathon chair is similar to that of a working group
   chair.  As with working groups, it is typically best to have co-
   chairs share responsibilities and workload.  The Chairs work very
   closely with the Secretariat on all responsibilities.  Key
   responsibilities include:

   o  Organize and deliver a Hackathon at each IETF meeting, soliciting
      help from all other roles to do much of the heavy lifting

   o  Encourage and provide guidance to champions who volunteer to lead
      projects

   o  Maintain the Hackathon wiki (e.g.
      https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/109Hackathon) and all
      of its child pages.

   o  Moderate Hackathon@ietf.org email list

   o  Request sessions for Hackathon opening and closing at IETF meeting
      (i.e. https://datatracker.ietf.org/secr/sreq/)

   o  Emcee the Hackathon, including the opening and closing sessions
      and announcements in between

   o  Create and manage the GitHub repo used for each Hackathon (e.g.
      https://github.com/ietf-hackathon/ietf108-project-presentations
      [18]

   o  Main point of contact for all Hackathon questions and concerns

8.2.  Secretariat

   Key responsibilities include:

   o  Configure and manage Hackathon registration system

   o  Maintain Hackathon web page [19]

   o  Create and maintain web page for each Hackathon (e.g.
      https://www.ietf.org/how/runningcode/Hackathons/109-Hackathon/)

   o  Create wiki page for each Hackathon (e.g.
      https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/109Hackathon).  This
      is initialized and updated at times by the Secretariat, but the
      Chair(s) are ultimately responsible for maintaining it.

   o  Handle venue logistics for Hackathon, Hackdemo Happy Hour, and
      Code Lounge (e.g. reserve room, food and beverages, AV, etc.)

   o  Internal IETF promotion (e.g. email messages to community)

   o  Assist with external outreach, as needed, including finding
      sponsors

8.3.  Sponsor

   Key responsibilities include:

   o  Provide some funding to help offset costs of Hackathon (either per
      meeting or per year, depending on model)

   o  Optionally provide t-shirts or other giveaways

   o  Optionally provide support staff to assist with Hackathon

8.4.  Champions of Projects

   Champions of projects are the key to a successful Hackathon.  Key
   responsibilities for champions include:

   o  Volunteer to lead a project at the Hackathon

   o  Serve as primary contact for the project

   o  Add and manage information on the Hackathon wiki for the project

   o  Promote the project to appropriate groups inside IETF and outside
      as well

   o  Welcome and organize members of the team

   o  Provide focus, guidance, and leadership for the project

8.5.  IETF LLC, Director of Communications and Operations (was ISOC)

   Key responsibilities include:

   o  External (outside world) promotion

   o  Outreach to local universities

   o  Provide photographer

   o  Laptop stickers

8.6.  Judges

   The first several Hackathon involved judges who listened to summary
   presentations by teams at the closing of each Hackathon and
   identified winning teams for an arbitrary number of project
   categories.  Prizes were made available to members of winning teams.
   This was done as an incentive to participate in the Hackathon and
   present results, and to provide a fun yet informative end to the
   Hackathon that could be appreciated by the entire IETF community.
   Judging and awarding of prizes led to confusion regarding the nature
   of the Hackathon, making it appear to some overly competitive.
   Procurement of appropriate prizes was financially and logistically
   challenging.  Arrangement of judges, determination of winners, and
   awarding of prizes all became more time consuming, especially as the
   number of projects and participants grew.  Ultimately, it was deemed
   best to eliminate judging, awards, and prizes entirely.  Apparently
   the IETF community has an innate incentive to participate and present
   results in the Hackathon.

9.  Security Considerations

   None.

9.1.  Private Considerations

   Participant email addresses are displayed publicly.  Registrants
   optionally include these are part of their registrations.

   The email addresses of individual champions are often shared publicly
   by the champions on the wiki.

   The email addresses of the Chairs are shared publicly by the Chairs
   on the wiki and via GitHub.  It would probably be better to use an
   email alias.
