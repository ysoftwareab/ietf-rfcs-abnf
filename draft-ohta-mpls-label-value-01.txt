          Use of a reserved label value defined in RFC 3032  Feb 2002
                        for MPLS OAM functions 
    
    
   1. Introduction 
   This document describes use of an MPLS reserved label value for 
   identification of user-plane MPLS OAM packets as described in the 
   ITU-T draft Recommendation Y.1711 (on MPLS OAM functions) and makes a 
   request to IANA for allocation of a reserved label for this purpose. 
    
    
   2. OAM functions 
   MPLS OAM (Operation and Maintenance) provide necessary tools for 
   network operators to operate and maintain the networks.  MPLS OAM 
   functionality is required at the MPLS layer, and more specifically at 
   each MPLS level, independent of OAM functionality provided by the 
   lower layers (SONET/SDH, etc.).  The objectives of the OAM functions 
   include the followings: 
    
   - Defect and failure detection:  
   Defect/failures affecting the transport of user information are  
   detected by continuous or periodic checking. As a result,  
   maintenance event information or various alarms will be produced. 
    
   - Reporting the defect/failure information:  
   Defect information is given to other management entities (e.g.  
   Operation Support System) in order to provide the appropriate  
   indications to the maintenance staff for maintaining the Quality of  
   Service (QoS) level offered to customers. 
    
   - Defect/failure localization:  
   Determination by internal or external test systems of a failed entity  
   is performed if defect information is insufficient. 
    
   - Performance monitoring:  
   Performance (packet losses, transfer delay, bit errors, etc.) of  
   the user information transport is measured in order to estimate  
   the transport integrity.

   3. MPLS OAM work in ITU-T SG13 
   ITU-T Study Group 13, Question 3/13 is progressing work on user-plane 
   MPLS OAM and has produced the following documents: 
    
   (1) Approved Recommendation Y.1710 (Requirements for OAM 
   functionality for MPLS networks) [4] 
   (2) Draft Recommendation Y.1711 (OAM mechanisms for MPLS networks)[5] 
   (3) Draft Recommendation Y.1720 (MPLS Protection Switching)[6] which 
   relies on OAM mechanisms in Y.1711. 
    
   Please note that we are planning to put the document (2) above into 
   the approval process in the middle of February.  The user-plane MPLS

          Use of a reserved label value defined in RFC 3032  Feb 2002
                        for MPLS OAM functions 
    
   OAM mechanisms[5] relies on the use of a special label called 'OAM 
   Alert Label'.  Study Group 13 has tentatively decided to use one of 
   the reserved label values defined in RFC 3032(MPLS label stack 
   encoding)[7] to differentiate OAM packets from the normal user 
   packets. A value of 14 has been proposed for this purpose. IANA is 
   requested to consider if the use of this value is acceptable. Should 
   the said value not be acceptable by IANA, Study Group 13 is ready to 
   accept another reserved label value (as per IANA's recommendation). 
    
   Study group 13 appreciates if IANA advises the author of any problem 
   with the use of this value no later than April 30, 2002.   
   Extracts from draft Recommendation Y.1711 follow: 
    
   "1 Introduction 
   This Recommendation provides mechanisms for user-plane OAM (Operation 
   and Maintenance) functionality in MPLS networks according to the 
   requirements and principles given in Recommendation Y.1710.  It is 
   recognized that OAM functionality is important in public networks for 
   ease of network operation, for verifying network performance and to 
   reduce operational costs.  OAM functionality is especially important 
   for networks, which are required to deliver (and hence be measurable 
   against) QoS (Quality of Service) and availability performance 
   parameters/objectives." 
    
    
   " 5.1 Identification of OAM packets from normal user-plane traffic 
   The label structure defined in [7] indicates a single label field of 
   20 bits.  Some label field values have already been reserved for 
   special functions[7]. 
    
   This Recommendation introduces a new globally reserved label value, 
   herein referred to as the 'OAM Alert Label'.  The recommended 
   numerical value of the OAM Alert Label is 14." 
    
   Further information can be obtained from the author. 
    
    
   4. IANA considerations 
    
   It is requested that the IANA consider if the use of the MPLS 
   reserved label value of 14 as the 'OAM Alert Label' is acceptable.  
   If it is acceptable, it is requested that the use of this value is 
   officially assigned. Study group 13 appreciates if IANA will advise 
   the author of any problem with the use of this value, and if 
   necessary recommends an alternative reserved label value no later 
   than April 30, 2002.
