Abstract
   
   Over years many documents from IMAPEXT and LEMONADE working groups,
   as well as many individual documents have added syntactic
   extensions to many base IMAP commands described in RFC 3501. For
   ease of reference this document collects most of such ABNF changes
   in one place.
   
   This document updates ABNF in RFC 3501.

1.   Conventions Used in this Document
   
   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

2.   IMAP ABNF extensions
   
2.1  Optional parameters with the SELECT/EXAMINE commands
   
   This documents adds the ability to include one or more parameters
   with the IMAP SELECT or EXAMINE commands, to turn on or off certain
   standard behaviour, or to add new optional behaviours required for
   a particular extension.
   
   There are two possible modes of operation:
   
   o  A global state change where a single use of the optional
      parameter will effect the session state from that time on,
      irrespective of subsequent SELECT/EXAMINE commands.
   
   o  A per-mailbox state change that will effect the session only for
      the duration of the new selected state.  A subsequent SELECT/
      EXAMINE without the optional parameter will cancel its effect
      For the newly selected mailbox.
   
   Optional parameters to the SELECT or EXAMINE commands are added as
   a parenthesised list of atoms or strings, and appear after the
   mailbox name in the standard SELECT or EXAMINE command.  The order
   of individual parameters is arbitrary.  Individual parameters may
   consist of one or more atoms or strings in a specific order.  If a
   parameter consists of more than one atom or string, it MUST appear
   in its own parenthesised list.  Any parameter not defined by
   extensions that the server supports MUST be rejected with a BAD
   response.
   
      Example:
   
              C: a SELECT INBOX (ANNOTATE)
              S: ...
              S: a OK SELECT complete
   
      In the above example, a single parameter is used with the SELECT
      command.
   
      Example:
   
              C: a EXAMINE INBOX (ANNOTATE (RESPONSES "UID Responses")
                 CONDSTORE)
              S: ...
              S: a OK EXAMINE complete
   
      In the above example, three parameters are used with the EXAMINE
      command.  The second parameter consists of two items: an atom
      followed by a quoted string.
   
      Example:
   
              C: a SELECT INBOX (BLURDYBLOOP)
              S: a BAD Unknown parameter in SELECT command
   
      In the above example, a parameter not supported by the server is
      used. This results in the BAD response from the
      server.
   
   
2.2  Extensions to FETCH and UID FETCH Commands
   
    Arguments:  sequence set
                message data item names or macro
                OPTIONAL fetch modifiers
   
    Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH
   
    Result:     OK - fetch completed
                NO - fetch error: can't fetch that data
                BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
   
   This document extends the syntax of the FETCH and UID FETCH
   commands (see section 6.4.5 of [IMAP4]) to include optional FETCH
   modifiers.  No fetch modifiers are defined in this document.
   
   The order of individual modifiers is arbitrary.  An individual
   modifier may consist of one or more atoms or strings in a specific
   order.  If a modifier consists of more than one atom or string, it
   MUST appear in its own parenthesised list.  Any modifiers not
   defined by extensions that the server supports MUST be rejected
   with a BAD response.
   
   
2.3  Extensions to STORE and UID STORE Commands
   
   Arguments:  message set
               OPTIONAL store modifiers
               message data item name
               value for message data item
   
   Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH
   
   Result:     OK - store completed
               NO - store error: can't store that data
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   This document extends the syntax of the STORE and UID STORE
   commands (see section 6.4.6 of [IMAP4]) to include optional STORE
   modifiers.  No store modifiers are defined in this document.
   
   The order of individual modifiers is arbitrary.  Individual
   modifier may consist of one or more atoms or strings in a specific
   order.  If a modifier consists of more than one atom or string, it
   MUST appear in its own parenthesised list.  Any modifiers not
   defined by extensions that the server supports MUST be rejected
   with a BAD response.
   
   
2.4  Extensions to SEARCH Command
   
   Arguments:  OPTIONAL result specifier
               OPTIONAL [CHARSET] specification
               searching criteria (one or more)
   
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: SEARCH (*)
   
   Result:     OK - search completed
               NO - search error: can't search that [CHARSET] or
                    criteria
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
   
   
   This section updates definition of the SEARCH command described in
   section 6.4.4 of [IMAP4].
   
   The SEARCH command is extended to allow for result options. This
   document doesn't define any result option.
   
   The order of individual options is arbitrary.  Individual options
   may optionally contain parameters enclosed in parenthesises. If an
   option has parameters, they consist of one or more atoms or strings
   in a specific order. Any options not defined by extensions that the
   server supports MUST be rejected with a BAD response.
   
   (*) - An extension to SEARCH command may require another untagged
   response, or no untagged response to be returned.
   
   
2.5  Extensions to APPEND Command
   
   The APPEND command is extended to allow the client to append data
   containing NULs by using the <literal8> syntax. The ABNF was
   rewritten to allow for easier extensibility by IMAP extensions.
   

3.   Formal Syntax
   
   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].
   
   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [IMAP4].
   
   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.
   
     
     append          = "APPEND" SP mailbox 1*append-message
                       ;; only a single append-message may appear
                       ;; if MULTIAPPEND [MULTIAPPEND] capability

4.   Security Considerations
   
   It is believed that this document doesn't add any new security
   concerns that were not already identified in RFC 3501.


5.   IANA Considerations

   This document doesn't define any new IMAP extension, so no action
   from IANA is required.

11.1 Change Log

   00   Initial Revision.
   01   Added Cyrus as co-author. Added BINARY literals. Added section
        about APPEND. Clarified that the order of all parameters/modifiers is
        arbitrary. Unrecognized SELECT/EXAMINE parameter should cause the BAD,
        not the NO response.
   02   Updated boilerplate. Extended SEARCH modifiers to be consistent
        with STORE modifiers. Rewrote FETCH modifier syntax for consistency.
