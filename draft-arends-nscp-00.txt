Internet-Draft                    NSCP                     November 2007


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Rationale

   Operators of name servers often deploy software from multiple
   different vendors in order to reduce the threat from vulnerabilities
   found in any single implementation.  However, doing so requires
   understanding a different control interface for each implementation.
   Additionally, provisioning for name server clusters does not scale
   well, since it often requires active lower level management of
   individual hosts.

   This document defines a DNS name server control protocol which will
   permit management of multiple different name server implementations
   via a common interface.

   The NSCP will use NETCONF [1]as framework.

1.2.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  High level requirements

   The Protocol should:

   o  Enable the operation of all nameserver implementations
   o  Allow the (un)setting of all nameserver configuration parameters
   o  Be able to signal which operations are supported by the
      implementation being controlled
   o  Allow the collection of any available nameserver statistics
   o  Be extensible to allow implementors to extend to cover new objects
      and methods.
   o  Be able to handle any dns data that might be seen on the wire,
      whether or not it is legal.

   The requirements for the protocol are independent of the actual
   functions that a nameserver implementation provides.  Any operation
   listed in this document does not require support for this function in
   an implementation.  It is RECOMMENDED however, that functions which
   are supported by nameservers can be supported by this protocol,
   either as a core function, or as part of the extentions.

   The level of feedback, such as state, or statistics that an
   implementation returns differs per implementation.  This document

   does not dictate form or grammar of this feedback, but does allow the
   transfer of this data.  The extensibility of the protocol should be
   rich enough to allow for various forms and ways of aggregating this
   feedback.


3.  Approaches to Nameserver Control

   There have been several different approaches suggested for
   controlling nameservers.  Possibilities include, but are not limited
   to, NETCONF, SNMP, some kind of in-band DNS based solution or a
   totally new protocol.  Whilst any of these solutions can work we
   favor a solution based on NETCONF for the following reasons.

   o  It is based on XML.
   o  It operates persistent connections.
   o  It operates a command/response model.
   o  The protocol describes how error information is returned from the
      agent to the client.
   o  It is extensible.
   o  It allows a client to discover the set of protocol extensions
      supported by a server.
   o  It provides a separation of configuration and state data.
   o  It is designed to run on multiple different transports such as ssh
      which have built-in strong authentication and encryption.
   o  It provides sophisticated searching capabilities.


4.  Data Model

   Netconf treats the contents of its configuration elements as opaque
   data and assumes that the application will know what to do with it.
   For this reason it is necessary to define a data model to contain DNS
   configuration data.  This data model will be required for use in NSCP
   and may be of use to developers of future nameserver implementations.

   There are several options for doing this, two of which are presented
   here:

4.1.  A generic model

   A typical nameserver configuration file is made up of sections and
   configuration items.  A possible representation is shown in the
   following fragment of XML:

      <file name="ns.conf">
         <section name="server">
            <configitem name="ip-address">10.0.0.1</configitem>
            <configitem name="version">not available</configitem>
         </section>
         <section name="zone">
            <configitem name="name">example.com</configitem>
            <configitem name="zonfile">example.com.zone</configitem>
         </section>
      </file>

4.2.  A Structured DNS model

   Analysis of a range of nameserver configurations leads to a model
   that is specific to DNS, such as:

                  Server
                    |
       +------------+------------+
       |                         |
   PeerGroup                 Panorama
       |1                        |1
       |                         |
       |*             1        * |*
      Peer        ACL -------- View -------- Zone
                   |1               1      *   |1
                   |                           |
                   |*                          |*
                  ACE                        RRSet
                                               |1
                                               |
                                               |1..*
                                               RR
                                               ^ --[ Inheritance symbol
                                               |
                                               |
                                           Specific RR

   In the above diagram, the names of the elements correspond to
   standard DNS concepts, with the following additions:

   o  Peer - either a master or slave of the server in question.
   o  PeerGroup - the collection of Peers.
   o  Panorama - a collection of views.


5.  Security Considerations
