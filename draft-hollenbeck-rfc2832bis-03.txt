Internet-Draft            VeriSign RRP v2.0.0             September 2002


1. Introduction

   The Network Solutions, Inc.  (NSI) Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP)
   was developed by NSI in 1998 and 1999 to allow multiple registrars to
   provide second level Internet domain name registration services in
   the top level domains (TLDs) administered by the NSI TLD registry.
   Version 1.1.0 of the NSI RRP was published as Informational RFC 2832
   [2] in May 2000.  This document describes changes to RFC 2832 that
   specify version 2.0.0 of the protocol.

2. Protocol Updates

   This specification describes several modifications to RFC 2832 [2]:
   two new response codes have been added, domain TRANSFER command
   processing is updated to allow a client to cancel a requested domain
   transfer, and support for IPv6 name server addresses is added.

2.1 Response Codes

   Section 5.1 of RFC 2832 [2] is updated to include two additional
   error response codes.

   510 Invalid encoding

   The value of a domain name or name server entity contains an invalid
   ASCII compatible encoding used to represent an internationalized
   domain or host name.  The encoding is checked and verified in two
   situations: when registering an internationalized domain name or name
   server name, and when changing the name of a name server and the new
   name of the server is internationalized.

   Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] is updated to include the addition of
   response code 510 to the possible error values returned from the ADD
   command:

   Command: ADD
   Success: 200, 220
   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531,
   535, 540, 541, 545, 546, 547, 549, 550, 554

   557 Name server locked

   An attempt has been made to modify or delete a name server that is
   hosting a TLD in the root zone.  Modifications to the root zone can
   only be made with the approval of the U.S.  Department of Commerce
   and IANA, so if the registrar absolutely needs to modify or delete
   such a name server the action needs to be coordinated through the
   registry operator using an out-of-band communications channel.

   Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] is updated to include the addition of
   response code 557 to the possible error values returned from the DEL
   and MOD commands:

   Command: DEL
   Success: 200, 220
   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 520, 531, 532,
   533, 541, 544, 545, 547, 549, 551, 552, 553, 557

   Command: MOD
   Success: 200, 220
   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531,
   535, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 557


2.2 TRANSFER Command Update

   Section 4.3.10 of RFC 2832 [2] is updated to include an additional
   TRANSFER command processing option.

   Old text:

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
   request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting
   registrar.  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name
   may explicitly approve or reject a requested transfer.  The registry
   MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed
   amount of time.

   New text:

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
   request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting
   registrar.  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name
   may explicitly approve a requested transfer.  The current sponsoring
   registrar MAY explicitly reject a requested transfer.  The registry
   MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed
   amount of time.  The requesting registrar MAY cancel a pending
   request, but the request to cancel the transfer MUST be sent before
   it has been explicitly approved or rejected by the current sponsoring
   registrar or it has been implicitly approved or rejected by the
   registry.

   Example:

   A registrar cancels a previously requested domain transfer:

2.3 IPv6 Name Server Addresses

   Section 7 of RFC 2832 [2] is updated to include support for name
   servers using IPv6 addresses.  IPv6 addressing architecture is
   described in RFC 2373 [3].  This ABNF [4] grammar supplements the
   grammar defined in RFC 2832.

   ; Lexical Tokens

   hexdigit = digit / %X41-46 / %x61-66   ; 0-9 / A-F / a-f

   doubleoctet = 1*4hexdigit

   docolon = doubleoctet colon

   colondo = colon doubleoctet

   ip-address =  ip-address-v4 / ip-address-v6


   ; ipv4 addresses
   ip-address-v4 = 1*3digit dot 1*3digit dot 1*3digit dot 1*3digit


   ip-address-v6 =  ip-address-v6-standard / ip-address-v6-compressed
   ; Standard form of IPv6 addresses
   ; 8 hexdigit strings of length 1-4 separated by colons
   ;
   ; Eg: 10AA:0:0:00:8:800:200C:417A


   ip-address-v6-standard = doubleoctet 7colondo

   ; Compressed form of IPv6 addresses
   ; Runs of zero-value octets are represented by '::'
   ;
   ; Examples:
   ;       ::                        ==> 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
   ;
