Abstract

   This memo obsoletes RFC 2620 by deprecating the MIB table containing
   IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for
   version neutral IP address formats.  The remaining MIB objects from
   RFC 2620 are carried forward into this document.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2866 [RFC2866].


2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   The objects defined within this memo relate to the Remote
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Accounting Client as
   defined in RFC 2866 [RFC2866].


3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


4.  Scope of Changes

   This document obsoletes RFC 2620 [RFC2620], RADIUS Authentication
   Client MIB, by deprecating the radiusAuthServerTable table and adding
   a new table, radiusAuthServerExtTable, containing
   radiusAuthServerInetAddressType, radiusAuthServerInetAddress, and
   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber.  The purpose of these added MIB
   objects is to support version neutral IP addressing formats.  The
   existing table containing radiusAuthServerAddress and
   radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber is deprecated.  The remaining MIB
   objects from RFC 2620 are carried forward into this document.

   RFC 4001 [RFC4001], which defines the SMI Textual Conventions for
   IPv6 addresses, contains the following recommendation.

   'In particular, when revising a MIB module that contains IPv4
   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using the
   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC 4001] that support all
   versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be "current",
   whereas the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be
   changed to "deprecated".  The other approach, of having multiple
   similar tables for different IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The RADIUS accounting protocol, described in RFC 2866 [RFC2866],
   distinguishes between the client function and the server function.
   In RADIUS accounting, clients send Accounting-Requests, and servers
   reply with Accounting-Responses.  Typically NAS devices implement the
   client function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS
   accounting client MIB, while RADIUS accounting servers implement the
   server function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS
   accounting server MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to perform
   both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS proxy may
   act as a server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while
   simultaneously acting as an accounting client to one or more
   accounting servers.  In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS
   entities combining client and server functionality will support both
   the client and server MIBs.

   This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table, the
   RADIUS Accounting Server Table, which contains one row for each
   RADIUS server with which the client shares a secret.  Each entry in
   the RADIUS Accounting Server Table includes fifteen columns
   presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS client.


6.  Deprecated Objects

   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward from RFC 2620
   [RFC2620].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be desirable
   for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:

   1.  The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.
   2.  The managed entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,
       and the deprecated table is supported for backwards compatibility
       with older management stations.  This option SHOULD only be used
       when the IP addresses in the new table are in IPv4 format and can
       accurately be represented in both the new table and the
       deprecated table.

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Acct Client MIB (IPv6)         October 2005


   Managed entities SHOULD NOT instantiate the deprecated table
   containing IPv4-only address objects when the RADIUS server address
   represented in the table row is not an IPv4 address.  Managed
   entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate values of IP address or SNMP
   object access errors for IPv4-only address objects in otherwise
   populated tables.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no new IANA assignments.


9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These are:

   radiusAcctServerIPAddress This can be used to determine the address
      of the RADIUS accounting server with which the client is
      communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting an
      attack on the accounting server.

   radiusAcctServerInetAddress This can be used to determine the address
      of the RADIUS accounting server with which the client is
      communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting an
      attack on the accounting server.

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Acct Client MIB (IPv6)         October 2005



   radiusAcctClientServerPortNumber This can be used to determine the
      port number on which the RADIUS accounting client is sending.
      This information could be useful in impersonating the client in
      order to send data to the accounting server.

   radiusAcctClientServerInetPortNumber This can be used to determine
      the port number on which the RADIUS accounting client is sending.
      This information could be useful in impersonating the client in
      order to send data to the accounting server.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [RFC2575] is recommended.  Using these security
   features, customer/users can give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.
