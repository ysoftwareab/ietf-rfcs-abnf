    Fast Stateless Address Auto-configuration and Duplicate Address
                       Detection in IPv6 Network
                         draft-liu-ipv6-fdad-00

Abstract

   This document proposes an efficient method to speed the address auto-
   configuration and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) in IPv6 network
   and thus greatly decrease the time spend on the address configuration
   and DAD.  This is achieved by modifing the host and router's
   behaviour and related IPv6 messages.

Internet-Draft                  Fast DAD                        May 2010


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 [RFC2460] is the Internet Protocol designed for the next
   generation network.  Compared with IPv4, some new features are
   introduced.  Among these new features, Stateless Address
   Configuration [RFC2462] allows a host to generate its own IPv6
   addresses using a combination of locally available information and
   information advertised by routers.  Routers advertise prefixes that
   identify the subnet(s) associated with a link, while hosts generate
   an "interface identifier" that uniquely identifies an interface on a
   subnet.  An address is formed by combining the two.  Router sends
   Router Advertisements (RA) periodically which contain two flags
   indicating what type of auto-configuration (if any) should be
   performed.  A "managed address configuration" flag indicates whether
   hosts should use stateless auto-configuration to obtain addresses.
   The RA message also contains zero or more Prefix Information options
   that provide on-link prefixes for address auto-configuration.

   Upon receiving the RA message, the host generates an IPv6 address
   based on the received Prefix Information by itself.  Then the host
   performs Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) by sending out a Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS) message containing the newly generated address.  If
   the address is already used by another host, that host replies with a
   Neighbor Advertisement (NA) defending the address.  Once a defending
   NA is received, the address auto-configuration process is stopped,
   another address is re-generated or manual configuration is performed.
   Once it has sent the NS, the node waits for RetransTimer milliseconds
   (ms) for a defending NA, and this solicit-and-wait process is
   repeated DupAddrDetectTransmits times.  The default value of
   RetransTimer is 1000ms and by default the process is done once,
   resulting in a default delay of 1000ms, i.e., 1 second (s) for DAD.

   For Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] enabled nodes, part of the Layer 3 handover
   delay is contributed by the configuration of the Care-of-Address
   (CoA) and DAD when the node moves into a visiting network.  From the
   above analysis, the address configuration and DAD process may add up
   to 1s delay, which is significant for real-time applications such as
   VoIP.  Hence if we could reduce the time spending on DAD procedure,
   the whole Mobile IPv6 handover procedure could be speed up.

   Some methods have been proposed to reduce the duration time of DAD.

   In [RFC4429], Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection is proposed by
   N. Moore.  In this proposal, a new address state, 'Optimistic', is
   introduced.  This state is used to mark an address that is available
   for use but that has not completed DAD.  The use of Optimistic
   Address is limited, for example, it should not be used as a source
   address in new communications.  However for MIPv6, if the Optimistic

Internet-Draft                  Fast DAD                        May 2010


   Address is used in the Binding Update message as the Care-of-Address
   before the DAD process is finished, the handover process may be
   disrupted when duplicated address is detected.

   In [END], the Access Router maintains an Address Cache which contains
   a list of addresses of all connected hosts.  To check an address, an
   MS sends Neighbor Solicitations per RFC2461 and RFC2462.  Upon
   receiving the NS, the Access Router compares the tentative address in
   the NS against the entries in its Address Cache.  If there is no
   match, the Access Router makes an entry for the (tentative) address
   in its Address Cache and sends a special Router Advertisement to the
   MS indicating the address's uniqueness.  If there is a match that
   indicates that the address is conflict with another host, the Access
   Router relays the NS to the address owner without any modification.
   Upon receiving the NS, the address owner replies with an NA to defend
   its address.  The Access Router relays the NA to the soliciting MS
   without any modification.  Upon receiving the defending NA, the
   soliciting MS perceives the address conflict and refrains from
   assigning the tentative address to the interface.  This mechanism
   reduces the DAD process significantly, however, there is still some
   delay introduced by the signaling exchange.

   Some access networks are point-to-multipoint networks in which the
   hosts can not communicate with other hosts connected to the same
   access router and all communication should go through the access
   router first.  For example, in IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) network [RFC5154],
   the subscriber station is not capable of multicasting (e.g., for
   neighbor discovery, IP multicasting services, etc.) or direct
   communication to the other nodes attached to the same Base Station
   within the same subnet (prefix).

   Proxy Neighbour Discovery (PND) is often used to handle the neighbour
   discovery problem in the above networks.  The access router maintains
   an address table which contains a list of IPv6 addresses and
   corresponding link-layer addresses that are being used by all IPv6
   hosts in the same subnet.  Upon receiving NS, the router would relay
   the NS message to the solicited host or send back a NA message
   directly on behalf of the solicited host.

   In this document, a fast Stateless Address Auto-configuration and DAD
   process is proposed, in which an Address Table is used to contain the
   addresses and their corresponding link-layer addresses of all hosts
   in the same link.  Unlike the standard method as defined in
   [RFC2462], after the stateless address configuration, an explicit NS
   message is sent to notify the access router.  In addition, since the
   probability of having a duplicate address is too small, the DAD
   process is omitted by the host.  Instead, the access router performs
   the DAD on behalf of the host.  If duplicate address is detected,

   then the access router notifies the host to re-generate a new
   address.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
   [STANDARDS].

   o  MS - Mobile Station.

   o  BS - Base Station.


3.  Requirements

3.1.  Host's Requirements

   The host should set the access router as the default gateway after
   receiving the RA message from it and all communication should go
   through the router; The host should be able to process the modified
   messages as defined below.

3.2.  Access Router's Requirements

   The access router should maintain an address table.  This table
   contains the host's IPv6 address, link-layer address, life time and
   etc.  Access routers should process all received NS with specified
   and unspecified source address and solicited-node-multicast
   destination address for DAD and address resolving.


4.  General Fast DAD Procedure

   When a host boots up or moves into a new network, it sends a Router
   Solicitation (RS) message to perform router and prefix discovery as
   defined in [RFC2461].  After receiving a valid RS message, the access
   router should send a special Router Advertisement (RA) as reply.  The
   RA message is used to indicate the fast address configuration and DAD
   should be used by the host.

   If the host could recognize the special RA message, it generates a
   stateless IPv6 address as described in RFC2462.  Then the host would
   skip the normal DAD process and sends a special NS message
   immediately to the access router to notify its configured address.

Internet-Draft                  Fast DAD                        May 2010


   After receiving the NS message, the access router compares the
   address in the message against the entries in its Address Table.  If
   there is no match, the access router create an entry contains the
   address and the corresponding link-layer address of the host.

   Otherwise, if there exists a match indicates that the address is
   duplicate, the access router sends a special NA message to notify the
   host that duplicate address is detected and another address needs to
   be generated.  Before a new unique address is generated by the host,
   the access router does not forward the data packet from or to this
   host.

   If the host receives the special NA message, it should abandon the
   duplicate address contained in the message.  And it should re-
   generate a new stateless address automatically and repeat the above
   process.


5.  Message Format

5.1.  Overview

   In this document, the messages defined in IPv6 standards are reused
   and some modification are made as described below:

   o  An "E" indication bit is added to the reserved section of the RA
      message.

   o  An "E" and "D" indication bit is added to the reserved section of
      the NS message.

   o  An "E" indication bit is added to the reserved section of the NA
      message.

5.2.  Modified Router Advertisement Message Format

   The fields in the message are as defined in RFC2461 RFC 2461
   [RFC2461]except one bit (E bit) is added to the 'Reserved' field.  If
   the access router wants to request the hosts to use the fast
   stateless address configuration, it must set the 'E' bit of the RA
   message sent to the hosts in order to indicate the fast address
   configuration and DAD may be used.

            Figure 3: Modified Neighbour Advertisement Message


6.  Modified Host and Router Behaviour

   The host and access router behaviours should be modified to deal with
   these modified messages.

6.1.  Modified Host Behaviour

   Upon receiving a RA message, the host should check the 'E' bit of the
   message to see if the fast stateless address auto-configuration is
   required.  If the 'M' bit is not set and 'E' bit is set, a stateless
   IPv6 address is generated according to the procedure defined in
   RFC2462.  In the proposed mechanism, the 'Tentative Address' is not
   used anymore.  The generated address is assigned to the host's
   interface as an effective address and an explicit NS message is send
   to the access router immediately.  In this message, the 'E' bit is
   set to indicate that this is an explicit registration message for
   fast DAD.

   Afterwards, if a NA message is received and the 'E' bit is set in the
   message, the host compares the 'Target Address' with its own
   generated address.  If the two addresses are the same, then a
   duplicate address is detected by the access router.  The host must
   abandon the current assigned address and re-generated an address as
   defined in RFC2462.  As described as above, the data packets sent
   before the NA message is received are discarded by the router.
   Because the router would send the NA message to the host immediately
   after the duplicated address is detected, the impact on the host is
   small.

   When the host wants to move out of the subnet or stop using the
   address, it sends a NS message with 'D' bit set to the access router
   to de-register the address explicitly.

Internet-Draft                  Fast DAD                        May 2010


   If the host can not recognize the 'E' and 'D' bit in the RA and NA
   message, its behavior is the same as defined in RFC2462.

6.2.  Modified Router Behaviour

   In the proposed mechanism, the 'E' bit is set in the RA message to
   indicate the fast address configuration and DAD are used.  The RA
   message is sent periodically or when a Router Solicitation message is
   received.  Upon receiving a Neighbour Solicitation message, the
   router checks if the 'E' bit of the message is set.  If the 'E' bit
   is set, the router compares the 'Target Address' field in the message
   against the Address Table.  If there is a match, then the address is
   conflict with another host.  The router must send the host a NA
   message with 'E' bit set to indicate the duplicate address is
   detected.  Before a unique address is re-generated by the host, all
   messages sent from the host must not be forwarded to other nodes, so
   the duplicate address does not cause problems for other hosts.  If
   there is no match in the Address Table, the router creates an entry
   in the Address Table to store the 'Target Address' and the
   corresponding link-layer address.

   If the 'D' bit is set in the received NS message, the access router
   compares the 'Target Address' field in the message against the
   Address Table.  If there is a match, then delete the entry that
   contains the address.  If there is no match in the Address Table,
   just ignore the message.

   After the entry is created, the updating and ageing of the contents
   of the entry could refer to the Neighbor Cache maintaining procedure
   described in RFC2461.

   If the 'E' bit and 'D' bit are not set in the received NS message,
   the NS is treated as a normal address resolving message.  The router
   compares the 'Target Address' field against the address list.  If
   there is a match, then a normal NA message is sent to the soliciting
   host.  In this NA message, the 'Target Address' field is set to the
   one in the NS message.  If there is no match and the source address
   of the NS message is unspecified, then the NS message is sent out in
   the normal DAD process.  Then an entry is created to contain the
   'Target Address' and link-layer address in the NS message.  So the
   router could support both modified hosts and un-modified hosts.


7.  The Example Usage in 802.16 Network

   Let's suppose a mobile subscriber station (MS) is moving into a
   mobile WiMAX network (802.16e) in which Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is
   supported.  As mentioned as above, the WiMAX IP network is a point-

   to-multipoint network.  A MS can not communicate with another MS
   directly.  All the traffic should go through an Access Router
   (ASN-GW) as shown in Figure 4.  One thing to be noted is that in
   802.16 networks sometimes the DAD process can be omitted, e.g., as
   described in [RFC5121] [RFC5154].  In these cases, the method
   described in the document is not necessary.  The process when the MS
   roams into a new access network is described as the follow:

   1.  After finishing layer-2 handover, the MS send a RS message to the
       Access Router (AR);

   2.  Upon receipt of the RS message, the AR sends a RA message to the
       MS.  In this message, the 'E' bit is set to indicate the fast
       address configuration and DAD.  Also the 'Prefix Information'
       option is included in the message;

   3.  The MS generates a stateless address based on the prefix
       information extracted from the RA message.  The MS also set the
       AR as the default gateway;

   4.  After the address is generated, an explicit NS message is sent to
       the AR.

   5.  The AR checks the address contained in the NS message in its
       address list.  If not found, the AR creates an entry for this MS
       in which the CoA and the corresponding link-layer address is
       contained.

   6.  If duplicate address is found, an NA message with 'E' bit set is
       sent to the MS by the AR.

   7.  The MS uses the address as the Care-of-Address (CoA), and sends a
       Binding Update (BU) message to register with Home Agent.  If the
       CoA is not in conflict with other MSs, the AR forwards the BU
       message to the next hop.  Otherwise, the BU message is discarded
       by the AR.  And the MS must re-generate a new CoA and repeats the
       above steps; When the MS is about to move out from the subnet, it
       sends a NS message with 'D' bit set to de-register with the
       access router explicitly.  If the MS does not send the explicit
       de-register message before moving out, the corresponding entry in
       the access router would be invalid after the lifetime expires.

   From the above procedure, we could see that the proposed mechanism
   can significantly decrease the overall handover delay by reducing the
   time spent in address configuration and DAD.  So it could reduce the
   overall handover delay in Mobile IPv6 networks.
