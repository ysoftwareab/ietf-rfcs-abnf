      Discovery Of Restconf Metadata for Source-specific multicast
                       draft-ietf-mboned-dorms-01

Abstract

   This document defines DORMS (Discovery Of Restconf Metadata for
   Source-specific multicast), a method to discover and retrieve
   extensible metadata about source-specific multicast channels using
   RESTCONF.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP
   address is configured to use SRV resource records to advertise the
   hostname of a RESTCONF server that publishes metadata according to a
   new YANG module with support for extensions.  A new service name and
   the new YANG module are defined.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines DORMS (Discovery Of Restconf Metadata for
   Source-specific multicast).

   A DORMS service is a RESTCONF [RFC8040] service that provides read
   access to data in the "ietf-dorms" YANG [RFC7950] model defined in
   Section 4.  This model, along with optional extensions defined in
   other documents, provide an extensible set of information about
   multicast data streams.  A review of some example use cases that can
   be enabled by this kind of metadata is given in Section 1.3.

   This document defines the "dorms" service name for use with the SRV
   DNS Resource Record (RR) type [RFC2782].  A sender using a DORMS
   service to publish metadata SHOULD configure at least one SRV RR for
   the "_dorms._tcp" subdomain in the reverse IP DNS zone for the source
   IP used by some active multicast traffic.  The domain name in one of
   these SRV records provides a hostname corresponding to a DORMS server
   that can provide metadata for the sender's source-specific multicast
   traffic.  Publishing such a RR enables DORMS clients to discover and
   query a DORMS server as described in Section 2.

1.1.  Background

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic DNS concepts
   described in [RFC1034], [RFC1035], and the subsequent documents that
   update them, as well as the use of the SRV Resource Record type as
   described in [RFC2782].

   The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the concepts and
   terminology regarding source-specific multicast as described in
   [RFC4607] and the use of IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and MLDv2 [RFC3810] for
   group management of source-specific multicast channels, as described
   in [RFC4604].

   The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the concepts and
   terminology for RESTCONF [RFC8040] and YANG [RFC7950].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Motivation

   DORMS provides a framework that can be extended to publish
   supplemental information about multicas traffic in a globally
   discoverable manner.  This is useful so that entities engaged in
   delivery or processing of the traffic that are not affiliated with
   the sender of the traffic and who may not otherwise have any means to
   discover information about the traffic, such as forwarding ISPs or
   operators of firewalls providing security guarantees to their users,
   can discover the information they may need in order to process the
   traffic according to their requirements.

1.3.1.  Use cases

   For example, a network that is capable of forwarding multicast
   traffic may need to take provisioning actions or make admission
   control decisions at ingress points based on the expected bitrate of
   the traffic in order to prevent oversubscription of the network.

   Other use cases may include metadata that can be used to authenticate
   the multicast traffic, metadata that describes the contents of the
   traffic, metadata that makes assertions about the legal status of the

Internet-Draft                    DORMS                     October 2020


   traffic within specific contexts, or metadata that describes the
   protocols or applications that can be used to consume the traffic.
   Extensions to DORMS to support these or other kinds of metadata can
   be defined by later specifications.

   Detailing the specific of the possible extensions is out of scope for
   this document except to note that a range of possible use cases are
   expected and they may be supported by a variety of different future
   extensions.

1.3.2.  Channel Selection

   In general, a DORMS client might learn of an (S,G) by any means.
   Therefore, describing the full set of possible methods a DORMS client
   might use to discover a set of (S,G)s for which it wants metadata is
   out of scope for this document.

   But to give a few examples, a multicast receiver application that is
   a DORMS client might learn about an (S,G) by getting signals from
   inside the application logic, such as a selection made by a user, or
   a scheduled API call that reacts to updates in a library provided by
   a service operator.

   As another example, an on-path router that's a DORMS client might
   instead learn about an (S,G) by receiving a PIM message or an IGMP or
   MLD membership report indicating a downstream client has tried to
   subscribe to an (S,G).  Such a router might use information learned
   from the DORMS metadata to make an access control decision about
   whether to propagate the join futher upstream in the network.

   Other approaches for learning an (S,G) could be driven by monitoring
   a route reflector to discover channels that are being actively
   forwarded, for a purpose such as monitoring network health.

1.4.2.  Non-obvious doc choices

   Log of odd things that need to be the way they are because of some
   reason that the author or reviewers may want to know later.

   o  building the draft without this line produces a warning about no
      reference to [RFC6991] or [RFC8294], but these are imported in the
      yang model.  RFC 8407 requires the normative reference to 8294
      (there's an exception for 6991 but I'm not sure why and it doesn't
      seem forbidden).

2.  Discovery and Metdata Retrieval

   A client that needs metadata about an (S,G) MAY attempt to discover
   metadata for the (S,G) using the mechanisms defined here, and MAY use
   the metadata received to manage the forwarding or processing of the
   packets in the channel.

2.1.  DNS Bootstrap

   The DNS Bootstrap step is how a client discovers an appropriate
   RESTCONF server, given the source address of an (S,G).  Use of the
   DNS Bootstrap is OPTIONAL for clients with an alternate method of
   obtaining a hostname of a trusted DORMS server with information about
   the target (S,G).

   This mechanism only works for source-specific multicast (SSM)
   channels.  The source address of the (S,G) is reversed and used as an
   index into one of the reverse mapping trees (in-addr.arpa for IPv4,
   as described in Section 3.5 of [RFC1035], or ip6.arpa for IPv6, as
   described in Section 2.5 of [RFC3596]).

   When a DORMS client needs metadata for an (S,G), for example when
   handling a new join for that (S,G) and looking up the authentication

Internet-Draft                    DORMS                     October 2020


   methods that are available, a receiver or middlebox can issue a DNS
   query for a SRV RR using the "dorms" service name with the domain
   from the reverse mapping tree, combining them as described in
   [RFC2782].

   For example, while handling a join for (203.0.113.15, 232.1.1.1), a
   receiver would perform a DNS query for the SRV RRType for the domain:

        _dorms._tcp.15.113.0.203.in-addr.arpa.

   The DNS response for this domain might return a record such as:

        SRV 0 1 443 dorms-restconf.example.com.

   This response informs the receiver that a DORMS server should be
   reachable at dorms-restconf.example.com on port 443, and should
   contain metadata about multicast traffic from the given source IP.
   Multiple SRV records are handled as described by [RFC2782].

   A sender providing DORMS discovery SHOULD publish at least one SRV
   record in the reverse DNS zone for each source address of the
   multicast channels it is sending in order to advertise the hostname
   of the DORMS server to DORMS clients.  The DORMS servers advertised
   SHOULD be configured with metadata for all the groups sent from the
   same source IP address that have metadata published with DORMS.

2.2.  Ignore List

   If a DORMS client reaches a DORMS server but determines through
   examination of responses from that DORMS server that it may not
   understand or be able to use the responses of the server (for example
   due to an issue like a version mismatch or modules that are missing
   but are required for the DORMS client's purposes), the client MAY add
   this server to an ignore list and reject servers in its ignore list
   during future discovery attempts.

   A client using the DNS Bootstrap discovery method in Section 2.1
   would treat servers in its ignore list as unreachable for the
   purposes of processing the SRV RR as described in [RFC2782].  (For
   example, a client might end up selecting a server with a less-
   preferred priority than servers in its ignore list, even if an HTTPS
   connection could have been formed successfully with some of those
   servers.)

   If an ignore list is maintained, entries SHOULD time out and allow
   for re-checking after either the cache expiration time from the
   response that caused the server to be added to the ignore list, or

   for a configurable hold-down time that has a default value no shorter
   than an hour and no longer than 3 days.

2.3.  RESTCONF Bootstrap

   Once a DORMS host has been chosen (whether via an SRV RR from a DNS
   response or via some other method), RESTCONF provides all the
   information necessary to determine the versions and url paths for
   metadata from the server.  A walkthrough is provided here for a
   sequence of example requests and responses from a receiver connecting
   to a new DORMS server.

2.3.1.  Root Resource Discovery

   As described in Section 3.1 of [RFC8040] and [RFC6415], the RESTCONF
   server provides the link to the RESTCONF api entry point via the
   "/.well-known/host-meta" or "/.well-known/host-meta.json" resource.

   Example:

   The receiver might send:

        GET /.well-known/host-meta.json HTTP/1.1
        Host: dorms-restconf.example.com
        Accept: application/json

   The server might respond as follows:

         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:56:00 GMT
         Server: example-server
         Cache-Control: no-cache
         Content-Type: application/json

         {
           "links":[
             {
               "rel":"restconf",
               "href":"/top/restconf"
             }
           ]
         }

2.3.2.  Yang Library Version

   As described in Section 3.3.3 of [RFC8040], the yang-library-version
   leaf is required by RESTCONF, and can be used to determine the schema
   of the ietf-yang-library module:

Internet-Draft                    DORMS                     October 2020


   Example:

   The receiver might send:

         GET /top/restconf/yang-library-version HTTP/1.1
         Host: dorms-restconf.example.com
         Accept: application/yang-data+json

   The server might respond as follows:

         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:56:01 GMT
         Server: example-server
         Cache-Control: no-cache
         Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

         {
             "ietf-restconf:yang-library-version": "2016-06-21"
         }

   If a DORMS client determines through examination of the yang-library-
   version that it may not understand the responses of the server due to
   a version mismatch, the server qualifies as a candidate for adding to
   an ignore list as described in Section 2.2.

2.3.3.  Yang Library Contents

   After checking that the version of the yang-library module will be
   understood by the receiver, the client can check that the desired
   metadata modules are available on the DORMS server by fetching the
   module-state resource from the ietf-yang-library module.

   Example:

   The receiver might send:

         GET /top/restconf/data/ietf-yang-library:modules-state/\
             module=ietf-dorms,2016-08-15
         Host: dorms-restconf.example.com
         Accept: application/yang-data+json

   The server might respond as follows:

             "conformance-type": "implement",
             "name": "ietf-dorms",
             "namespace": "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dorms",

           }
         ]
       }

   Other modules required or desired by the client also can be checked
   in a similar way, or the full set of available modules can be
   retrieved by not providing a key for the "module" list.  If a DORMS
   client that requires the presence of certain modules to perform its
   function discovers the required modules are not present on a server,
   that server qualifies for inclusion in an ignore list according to
   Section 2.2.

2.3.4.  Metadata Retrieval

   Once the expected DORMS version is confirmed, the client can retrieve
   the metadata specific to the desired (S,G).

   Example:

   The receiver might send:

         GET /top/restconf/data/ietf-dorms:metadata/\
             sender=203.0.113.15/group=232.1.1.1
         Host: dorms-restconf.example.com
         Accept: application/yang-data+json

   The server might respond as follows:

         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:56:02 GMT
         Server: example-server
         Cache-Control: no-cache
         Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

         {
           "ietf-dorms:group": [
             {
               "group-address":"232.1.1.1",
               "udp-stream":[
                 {
                   "port":"5001"
                 }
               ]
             }
           ]
         }

   Note that when other modules are installed on the DORMS server that
   extend the ietf-dorms module, other fields MAY appear inside the
   response.  This is the primary mechanism for providing extensible
   metadata for an (S,G), so clients SHOULD ignore fields they do not
   understand.

   As mentioned in Section 3.2, most clients SHOULD use data resource
   identifiers in the request URI as in the above example, in order to
   retrieve metadata for only the targeted (S,G)s.

2.3.5.  Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

   It is RECOMMENDED that DORMS servers use the Access-Control-Allow-
   Origin header field, as specified by [whatwg-fetch], and that they
   respond appropriately to Preflight requests.

   The use of '*' for allowed origins is NOT RECOMMENDED for DORMS
   servers.  A review of some of the potential consequences of
   unrestricted CORS access is given in Section 7.5.

3.  Scalability Considerations

3.1.  Provisioning

   In contrast to many common RESTCONF deployments that are intended to
   provide configuration management for a service to a narrow set of
   authenticated administrators, DORMS servers often provide read-only
   metadata for public access or for a very large set of end receivers,




Holland                    Expires May 3, 2021                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    DORMS                     October 2020


   since it provides metadata in support of multicast data streams and
   multicast can scale to very large audiences.

   Operators are advised to provision the DORMS service in a way that
   will scale appropriately to the size of the expected audience.
   Specific advice on such scaling is out of scope for this document,
   but some of the mechanisms outlined in [RFC3040] or other online
   resources might be useful, depending on the expected number of
   receivers.

3.2.  Data Scoping

   In the absence of contextual information, clients SHOULD issue
   narrowed requests for DORMS resources by following the format from
   Section 3.5.3 of [RFC8040] to encode data resource identifiers in the
   request URI.  This avoids downloading excessive data, since the DORMS
   server may provide metadata for many (S,G)s, possibly from many
   different senders.

   However, clients MAY use heuristics or out of band information about
   the service to issue requests for (S,G) metadata narrowed only by the
   source-address, or not narrowed at all.  Depending on the request
   patterns and the contents of the data store, this may result in fewer
   round trips or less overhead, and can therefore be helpful behavior
   for scaling purposes in some scenarios.  Servers MAY restrict or
   throttle client access based on the client certificate presented (if
   any), or based on heuristics that take note of client request
   patterns.

   A complete description of the heuristics for clients and servers to
   meet their scalability goals is out of scope for this document.

4.  YANG Model

   The primary purpose of the YANG model defined here is to serve as a
   scaffold for the more useful metadata that will extend it.  Example
   specified use cases include providing authentication information
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mboned-ambi-00] and bit-rate information
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mboned-cbacc-00] for use by receivers and middle
   boxes, but more use cases are anticipated.

5.  Privacy Considerations

5.1.  Linking Content to Traffic Streams

   In the typical case, the mechanisms defined in this document provide
   a standardized way to discover information that is already available
   in other ways.

   However, depending on the metadata provided by the server, observers
   may be able to more easily associate traffic from an (S,G) with the
   content contained within the (S,G).  At the subscriber edge of a
   multicast-capable network, where the network operator has the
   capability to localize an IGMP [RFC3376] or MLD [RFC3810] channel
   subscription to a specific user or location, for example by MAC
   address or source IP address, the structured publishing of metadata
   may make it easier to automate collection of data about the content a
   receiver is consuming.

5.2.  Linking Multicast Subscribers to Unicast Connections

   Subscription to a multicast channel generally only exposes the IGMP
   or MLD membership report to others on the same LAN, and as the
   membership propagates through a multicast-capable network, it
   ordinarily gets aggregated with other end users.

   However, a RESTCONF connection is a unicast connection, and exposes a
   different set of information to the operator of the RESTCONF server,
   including IP address and timing about the requests made.  Where DORMS
   access becomes required to succeed a multicast join, as expected in a
   browser deployment, this can expose new information about end users
   relative to services based solely on multicast streams.

   In some deployments it may be possible to use a proxy that aggregates
   many end users when the aggregate privacy characteristics are needed
   by end users.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  YANG Model Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.  DORMS servers MAY use NACM
   to control access to data nodes.

   No data nodes defined in this YANG module are writable, creatable, or
   deletable.  This YANG module is intended for publication of read-only
   data according to a well-defined schema.

7.2.  Exposure of Metadata

   Although some DORMS servers MAY restrict access based on client
   identity, as described in Section 2.5 of [RFC8040], many DORMS
   servers will use the ietf-dorms YANG model to publish information
   without restriction, and even DORMS servers requiring client
   authentication will inherently, because of the purpose of DORMS, be
   providing the DORMS metadata to potentially many receivers.

   Accordingly, future YANG modules that augment data paths under "ietf-
   dorms:metadata" MUST NOT include any sensitive data unsuitable for
   public dissemination in those data paths.

   Because of the possibility that scalable read-only access might be
   necessary to fulfill the scalability goals for a DORMS server, data
   under these paths MAY be cached or replicated by numerous external
   entities, so owners of such data SHOULD NOT assume such data can be
   kept secret when provided by DORMS servers anywhere under the "ietf-
   dorms:metadata" path even if access controls are used with
   authenticated clients unless additional operational procedures and
   restrictions are defined and implemented that can effectively control
   the dissemination of the secret data.  DORMS alone does not provide
   any such mechanisms, and users of DORMS can be expected not to be
   following any such mechanisms in the absence of additional
   assurances.

Internet-Draft                    DORMS                     October 2020


7.3.  Secure Communications

   The provisions of Section 2 of [RFC8040] provide secure communication
   requirements that are already required of DORMS servers, since they
   are RESTCONF servers.  All RESTCONF requirements and security
   considerations remain in force for DORMS servers.

   It is intended that security related metadata about the SSM channels
   such as public keys for use with cryptographic algorithms may be
   delivered over the RESTCONF connection, and that information
   available from this connection can be used as a trust anchor.  The
   secure transport provided by these minimum requirements are relied
   upon to provide authenticated delivery of these trust anchors, once a
   connection with a trusted DORMS server has been established.

7.4.  Record-Spoofing

   When using the DNS Boostrap method of discovery described in
   Section 2.1, the SRV resource record contains information that SHOULD
   be communicated to the DORMS client without being modified.  The
   method used to ensure the result was unmodified is up to the client.

   There must be a trust relationship between the end consumer of this
   resource record and the DNS server.  This relationship may be end-to-
   end DNSSEC validation or a secure connection to a trusted DNS server
   that provides end-to-end safety to prevent record-spoofing of the
   response from the trusted server.  The connection to the trusted
   server can use any secure channel, such as with a TSIG [RFC2845] or
   SIG(0) [RFC2931] channel, a secure local channel on the host, DNS
   over TLS [RFC7858], DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484], or some other mechanism
   that provides authentication of the RR.

   If a DORMS client accepts a maliciously crafted SRV record, the
   client could connect to a server controlled by the attacker, and use
   metadata provided by them.  The consequences of trusting maliciously
   crafted metadata could range from attacks against the DORMS client's
   parser of the metadata (via malicious constructions of the formatting
   of the data) to arbitrary disruption of the decisions the DORMS
   client makes as a result of processing validly constructed metadata.

   Clients MAY use other secure methods to explicitly associate an (S,G)
   with a set of DORMS server hostnames, such as a configured mapping or
   an alternative trusted lookup service.

7.5.  CORS considerations

   As described in Section 2.3.5, it's RECOMMENDED that DORMS servers
   provide appropriate restrictions to ensure only authorized web pages
   access metadata for their (S,G)s from the widely deployed base of
   secure browsers that use the CORS protocol according to
   [whatwg-fetch].

   Providing '*' for the allowed origins exposes the DORMS-based
   metadata to access by scripts in all web pages, which opens the
   possibility of certain kinds of attacks against networks where
   browsers have support for joining multicast (S,G)s.

   If the authentication for an (S,G) relies on DORMS-based metadata
   (for example, as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-mboned-ambi-00]), an
   unauthorized web page that tries to join an (S,G) not permitted by
   the CORS headers for the DORMS server will be prevented from
   subscribing to the channels.

   If an unauthorized site is not prevented from subscribing, code on
   the site (for example a malicious advertisement) could request
   subscriptions from many different (S,G)s, overflowing limits on the
   joining of (S,G)s and disrupting the delivery of multicast traffic
   for legitimate use.

   Further, if the malicious script can be distributed to many different
   users within the same receiving network, the script could coordinate
   an attack against the network as a whole by joining disjoint sets of
   (S,G)s from different users within the receiving network.  The
   distributed subscription requests across the receiving network could
   overflow limits for the receiving network as a whole, essentially
   causing the websites displaying the ad to participate in an
   overjoining attack (see Appendix A of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mboned-cbacc-00]).

   Even if network safety mechanisms protect the network from the worst
   effects of oversubscription, the population counts for the multicast
   subscriptions could be disrupted by this kind of attack, and
   therefore push out legitimately requested traffic that's being
   consumed by real users.  For a legitimately popular event, this could
   cause a widespread disruption to the service if it's successfully
   pushed out.

   A denial of service attack of this sort would be thwarted by
   restricting the access to (S,G)s to authorized websites through the
   use of properly restricted CORS headers.
