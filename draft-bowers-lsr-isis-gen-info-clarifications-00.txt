1.  Introduction

   [RFC6823] defines the Generic Information TLV for carrying non-
   routing information in IS-IS.  The current document clarifies some
   aspects of [RFC6823].

2.  Associating Information Carried in GENINFO TLVs with Information
    Carried in Other IS-IS Advertisements

   In order to avoid duplicating information sent in IS-IS
   advertisements, it is useful for an application to be able to
   associate information carried in application-specific GENINFO APPsub-
   TLVs with the underlying objects being described by other IS-IS
   advertisements.  This is allowed as long as the requirements of
   Section 6 of [RFC6823] are met.

   As an example, an application may need to learn the latency of a
   particular link using the existing Unidirectional Link Delay sub-
   TLV(#33) carried in TLV#22, while at the same time using an
   application-specific GENINFO APPsub-TLV to distribute application-
   specific information about the same link.  If the APPsub-TLV carries
   the System ID of the neighbor together with an interface identifier,
   and the TLV#22 that carries the Unidirectional Link Delay sub-TLV
   also carries an interface identifer, then the application can
   uniquely identify the underlying link being described by the two
   advertisements.

Internet-Draft          GENINFO TLV Clarification          February 2021


   A document that specifies how an application-specific GENINFO TLV is
   used should also specify how associations of information in different
   advertisements should be made.

3.  Associating Information Carried in GENINFO TLVs with Information
    Carried in Other IS-IS Instances

   [RFC8202] specifies a mechanism for multiple IS-IS protocol instances
   to share the same circuit by including the IID-TLV in the PDUs
   associated with a particular IS-IS protocol instance.  GENINFO TLVs
   can be carried in different IS-IS instances.  When an application
   associates information carried in GENINFO TLVs with information
   carried in other IS-IS advertisements, it may be useful for the
   application to take into account the particular IS-IS instance in
   which those other IS-IS advertisements appear.

   As an example, in a particular network some links participate in
   three different IS-IS instances.  PDUs with IID=50 and IID=60
   correspond to two different IS-IS routing protocol instances, each
   with an independent IS-IS adjacency establishment, Update process,
   and Decision process.  PDUs with IID=70 correspond to an IS-IS
   instance dedicated to carrying the GENINFO TLVs for a particular
   application.  This application-specific IS-IS instance has an
   independent IS-IS adjacency establishment and Update process, but
   does not implement the IS-IS Decision process.  The network operator
   intends that the application should use the latency advertised using
   TLV#22/sub-TLV#33 in the IS-IS instance with IID=60.  This can be
   accomplished using configuration or other mechanisms.

   A document that specifies how an application-specific GENINFO TLV is
   used should also specify how associations of information in different
   advertisements should be made when multiple IS-IS instances are used.

4.  Congruent and Incongruent Instances

   Neither [RFC8202] nor [RFC6823] places any requirements on the use of
   congruent or incongruent IS-IS instances when multiple IS-IS
   instances are used.  In the example described in Section 3, the three
   IS-IS instances may be congruent with one another (that is, use the
   same set of links on which to form adjacencies) or not.

5.  Leaking the GENINFO TLV

   Section 4.1 of [RFC6823] contains the following requirement.

   In order to prevent the use of stale GENINFO information, a system
   MUST NOT use a GENINFO TLV present in an LSP of a system that is not

   currently reachable via Level-x paths, where "x" is the level (1 or
   2) associated with the LSP in which the GENINFO TLV appears.

   The above requirement does not provide an unambiguous specification
   for determining the reachability of a system originating a GENINFO
   TLV when multiple IS-IS instances are present.

   The current document clarifies the requirement of Section 4.1 of
   [RFC6823] in the following manner.  A document that specifies how an
   application-specific GENINFO TLV is to be leaked should also specify
   the means by which the leaking of stale GENINFO information is to be
   prevented.
