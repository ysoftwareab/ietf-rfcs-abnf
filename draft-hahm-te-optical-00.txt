Abstract

   WDM-based optical networks are becoming the core networks of the
   Internet transport infrastructure because of the plentiful bandwidth
   capacity they offer and their potential for real-time provisioning of
   bandwidth on demand.

   This document proposes control mechanisms for traffic engineering
   (TE) in optical networking, especially focusing on the integration of
   the control planes of MPLS and WDM-based networks. First of all, this

   document describes the basic operation of optical crossconnects(OXCs). 
   And, it introduces the concept of TE manager for the combined control 
   between two domains. Next, it defines the control messages exchanged 
   between network components such as OXCs, routers/LSRs, and the TE 
   manager. It then introduces the three traffic engineering procedures 
   of dynamic bandwidth provisioning, fast restoration, and withdrawal of 
   deployed network resources.


1. Introduction

   With the advent of MPLS, traffic engineering in the Internet became
   feasible. Explicit routing, prioritization of packets, rerouting
   schemes, etc. are same useful capabilities for traffic engineering
   that MPLS provides[1][2].

   However, because the MPLS operates with the fixed topology and
   bandwidth capacity of network, when the network suffers from
   insufficient bandwidth on the some links, the mere management of
   explicit L3 routing has the limitation to solve problems of bandwidth
   starvation. The eventual solution for traffic engineering must
   incorporate on-line/adaptive bandwidth provisioning based on the
   configurability of optical networks[3][4].

   Currently, the Internet transport infrastructure is moving toward
   high-density WDM optical networks. With the development of
   controllable optical devices, switching of individual light
   frequencies (i.e. lambdas) begins to be possible. Based on this, the
   topology, and the bandwidth capacity of optical backbone networks can
   be managed adaptively according to L3 requirements. However, as of
   yet, the control plane specifications for optical networking, and the
   relation between the IP layer and optical transport layer, are not
   well defined.

   This document provides a framework of the operation of the control
   plane for optical networking, especially from the OXC view point. It
   also defines a set of commands for controlling OXC components.

   This document proposes control plane integration between OXCs,
   routers(mean LSRs after this), and the TE manager for achieving
   robust traffic engineering. We provide detailed schemes on how these
   elements may communicate and collaborate with each other.

   The most desired benefits of traffic engineering in optical
   networking are adaptive bandwidth provisioning and fast restoration.
   We show how these goals are achieved by combining the exchange of
   control data between the network components such as OXCs, routers,
   and the TE manager.

2. Integrated System Architecture with OXCs and routers

   Figure 1 shows the integrated system architecture of a router with an
   attached OXC. Conceptually, this architecture includes a router-only
   system having fixed links with other routers, or a WDM-based pure
   optical crossconnect switch.

   Based on this architecture, we can control dynamic link connection
   between arbitrary routers, and manage the bandwidth capacity of each
   link on demand. We will show how the bandwidth capacity and the
   topology of router-to-router links can be managed by controlling the
   OXC system. In the case of a router-only system without OXC, we can
   assume the OXC is not controllable, and therefore the router has
   fixed connections with adjacent routers.  In the case of a pure OXC
   system without router, we consider only the dynamic connection with
   adjacent OXCs.

   Each component of the OXC and router, and their detailed functions
   will be explained below.

draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


2.1.1 Components of OXC

   OXC is a path-switching element which provides an optical transport
   connection. As shown in the figure, an OXC system is logically
   composed of multiple incoming lambdas(L1,L2,L3), which are
   multiplexed in incoming fibers(Fi1,Fi2), multiple outgoing
   lambdas(L1,L2,L3), which are multiplexed in outgoing fibers(Fo1,Fo2),
   lambda switches(LSs), lambda converters(LCs), optical-to-electric
   converters(OEs), and electric-to-optical converters(EOs).

   As used here, a "lambda" is a narrowly spaced wavelength optical
   signal, which is multiplexed with other lambdas onto an outgoing
   fiber, and which on receipt over an incoming fiber, is demultiplexed
   from its peers to extract the required signal. Each lambda has its
   own frequency or color.

   A "lambda switch" is an element that switches incoming lambdas to
   outgoing lambdas, where both lambdas have identical wavelength (the
   same color). When the colors of the two lambdas are different, it is
   necessary to convert one wavelength to another, so a "lambda
   converter" is used. Generally, lambda conversion is more difficult
   operation than lambda switching. And, LCs are less abundant resources
   than LSs.

   We assume LCs can work only within a limited operating range.  This
   means an LC can make only certain color conversions and not others.
   LSs also are limited, in that they can switch some lambdas but not
   others, because of the different position of lambdas and LSs.
   Therefore, even if we have sufficient remaining lambdas, LSs, and LCs
   in OXC, we can encounter situations where it is impossible to switch
   or convert the specific lambdas with intention.

   During operation, certain incoming or outgoing lambdas may be not be
   assigned for actual data transfer. These lambdas are called "dark
   lambdas." Similarly, a fiber is called a "dark fiber" when it is not
   in use.  See, incoming lambda L2 of incoming fiber Fi2 is a dark
   lambda.  Only when incoming and outgoing lambdas are dark, they can
   be switched or converted, because otherwise the transit operation
   would inevitably bring about data loss in lambdas.

   In our model we assume the OXC can be directly attached to the router
   with the OE and EO interfaces. The OE converts the incoming optical
   signal to electrical data for use in the router. The EO in turn
   converts the electrical outgoing data from the router to an optical
   signal to convey onto the outgoing lambda.

   We assume each OXC is IP capable and can participate in IP based
   control protocols. We assume internal operation of OXC may be
   configured remotely through sending control commands to the OXC. Even
   though in general any external system could capable of communicating
   with the OXC, we will restrict our attention to an architecture in
   which a TE manager controls all the OXC functions.


Hahm et al                                                      [Page 4]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


   Light signals on incoming fibers and each incoming lambda of each
   fiber are monitored continuously. In general, the disappearance of
   all light signals on a specific optical fiber implies the fiber has
   been disconnected or damaged. On the other hand, disappearance of the
   light signal of a single lambda implies the malfunction of an LS or
   LC.

   The detection of the disappearance of light signals is the basis of
   the restoration process. In general restoration can be processed in
   the IP layer as a MPLS function, or as an optical switching
   functions.


2.1.2 Control of the OXC

   The internal configuration of the OXC can be manipulated remotely by
   control messages[5] from the TE manager. In this section we outline
   the required types of control messages, arguments, their behavior,
   and possible responses.

   (1) Establish Connection

      This message makes a connection between an incoming lambda and an
      outgoing lambda. In order to escape the loss of data, both lambdas
      are recommended to be dark.  The message contains arguments such
      as incoming fiber id, incoming lambda id, outgoing fiber id,
      outgoing lambda id, and the explicit LC or LS id. As mentioned
      above, even if the unused lambdas, LSs, and LCs exist in OXC, they
      may fail to compose the requested operation, so the remaining
      resources and the applicability of them should be considered
      together.  Therefore, the explicit indication of the network
      resources as arguments is recommended.

      If this message executes without error, the OXC sends an ACK back
      to the TE manager containing the new connection ID. Since only the
      TE manager fully understands the pattern of resource consumption
      in the OXCs, after receiving ACK, the TE manager updates its table
      of resource availability for future use. If the OXC cannot execute
      this message properly, it replies with a NACK stating the reason
      to the TE manager.

   (2) Release Connection

      This message releases an existing connection between incoming and
      outgoing lambdas in an OXC. The message contains the connection id
      reported when the connection was established.  If the message
      executes successfully, the OXC replies with an ACK to the TE
      manager. Then the OXC reclaims the released network resources, and
      the TE manager updates the table of the resource availability for
      future use.

      If there is no existing connection with the designated id or the


Hahm et al                                                      [Page 5]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


      lambdas are currently in use for data transfer, or the OXC cannot 
      release the connection for some other reason, the OXC replies with 
      a NACK to the TE manager.

   (3) Attach Port

      This message connects a dark incoming lambda to an unused input
      port of the router, or an unused output port to a dark outgoing
      lambda. The message includes arguments such as incoming fiber id,
      incoming lambda id, and input port id; or output port id, outgoing
      fiber id, and outgoing lambda id, respectively. If this message
      executes successfully, the OXC replies with an ACK containing the
      new port connection id.

      If this message does not execute properly, the OXC replies with a
      NACK to the TE manager.

   (4) Detach Port

      This message releases the existing port connection between an
      incoming lambda and input port, or an output port and outgoing
      lambda. The message contains the port connection id. If this
      message executes successfully, the OXC replies with an ACK to TE
      manager. After execution, the OXC reclaims the released optical
      network resources for future use, and the TE manager updates the
      table of resource availability for future use.

      If there is no existing port connection with designated id or the
      lambdas are in use for data transfer currently, or the OXC cannot
      release the connection for some other reason, the OXC replies with
      a NACK to the TE manager.

   (5) Query

      This message is used to check whether or not the designated
      resources are available in the OXC. The message contains the list
      of desired resources as argument. If all designated resources are
      available, the OXC replies with an ACK to the TE manager. If any
      of the designated resources are unavailable, the OXC replies with
      a NACK containing the list of unavailable resources. This message
      is used to synchronize differences between the actual resource
      status in the OXC and the resource database in TE manger.

   (6) Alarm

      Unlike the previous messages, this message is issued from OXC to
      TE manager. This message is used to inform the emergency status of
      an OXC. When incoming fibers are cut off, OXC detect the loss of
      light signal and issues this alarm message.

      This message is also used to inform of accidents in incoming
      lambdas, which can occur through the malfunction of network


Hahm et al                                                      [Page 6]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


      componenets transferring the light signal, such as the LS and LC.

      In addition to these exchanges, the OXC continuously monitors its
      components, and informs the TE manager of its status periodically.


2.2 Router/LSR

   The router has the same functions as a normal router except the
   neighbor routers can be changed by reconfiguring the operation of
   attached OXC. A router has a number of input and output ports, which
   are connected to OEs and EOs of the OXC below. Among the ports, some
   input or output ports are not connected to outgoing lambda or
   incoming lambda. These ports are called as "unused ports", used for
   future configuration. In the figure, Ip2 is not connected any lambda
   of OXC, which is unused port. The configuration of the ports is
   managed by the OXC operation underneath. Therefore, the router just
   receives the result of configuration in a passive manner.

   If it is assumed that the router is a label switching router (LSR),
   capable of performing traffic engineering functions.  The router will
   broadcast its link state information by periodic flooding.  Based on
   this information, other LSRs can calculate QoS- assured routes
   considering the remaining bandwidth of each link, and label space in
   the routers involved. When the LSR broadcasts its link state
   information to other routers by the flooding mechanism defined in
   OSPF-LSA or ISIS-LSA [6], the TE manager also receives the flooded
   information, and understands the operational status of the network.

   In general depending on the bandwidth capacity of the link, a router
   may have multiple lightpaths to the same adjacent router.  These
   lightpaths may be differentiated as fully utilized lightpaths, less
   utilized lightpaths, and unused lightpaths. When it is necessary to
   release lightpaths to collect network resources, unused lightpaths
   can be released without affecting the operation of the network at
   all.

2.3 Relation between OXC and Router

   By manipulating the components of OXCs correctly, two routers can
   establish direct connections. A sequence of lambdas travelling
   through several OXCs offers a unidirctional lightpath. The components
   involved in the lightpath are the output port of the sending router,
   the EO of the sending OXC, the possibly LSs or LCs depending on the
   nature of the connection, the OE of the receiving OXC and the input
   port of the receiving router and the lambdas between them.

   In order to construct a lightpath without disturbing the existing IP
   level operation, the components involving the lightpath should be
   remained unused.

3. Framework for Combined Traffic Engineering

   In this section, we describe how traffic engineering is performed by
   combining MPLS and OXC control functions. The figure below shows the
   control signal between network elements, which are composed of
   routers, OXCs, and the TE manager. For this combined traffic
   engineering framework, we introduce the concept of a TE manager,
   which supports the integration between the control plane of the MPLS
   domain and the control plane of the optical networking domain.


   The figure below shows the IP network comprising of the lightpaths
   delivered from OXCs. There are directly connected optical fiber
   between OXC a and OXC b, OCX b and OXC e, OXC b and OXC c, OXC c and
   OXC d, OXC e and OXC f, OXC c and OXC f. The series of characters (%,
   #, @, &, *) represent the lightpaths between routers, they also show
   how the routers are connected each other.

   As seen in the figure, the TE manger has two kinds of control
   channels, one of which is a channel with routers, and the other is a
   channel with OXCs.

          figure 3: control signal for the traffic engineering

3.1 Introduction to the concept of the TE manager

   We can assume dynamic optical routing in a centralized manner[7], or
   in a distributed manner. A centralized method implies that route
   computations are carried out in one place, and the control commands
   for routing are also issued from one place. In distributed routing,
   route computations and control are performed at every router or OXC.
   In general, centralized methods and distributed methods have their
   own merits and short comings.  A centralized method permits simple
   control but does not provide scalability or robustness. On the other
   hand, the distributed method can be scalable in a sense, but may need
   to exchange much of their status information each other when the
   operation of one position strongly depends on the status of others.

   Because the lightpath assignment takes place much less frequently


Hahm et al                                                      [Page 9]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


   than the label switched path routing, scalability is not such a
   critical issue in a optical routing. Furthermore, because individual 
   optical route computations may have dependencies on each other, as
   each vie for the exclusive possession of resources, distributed 
   routing is not a good choice for optical routing.

   We assume a centralized method for the following reasons: (1) the
   timing of lightpath provisioning can be managed because we can
   estimate the progress of bandwidth increases or decreases by
   analyzing the link state information, (2) if the TE manager can
   control each OXC directly the control mechanisms can be simplified,
   (3) if the TE manager knows the internal structure and resources of
   OXCs, and guesses which resources of OXCs will be consumed according
   to its control command, message exchanges for synchronization can be
   eliminated, (4) the TE manger can have much greater computational
   power than an individual router or OXC, sufficient to meet the needs
   of the entire network


3.2 The analysis of network status and corresponding TE functions

   As mentioned previously, the TE manager receives link state
   information. By analyzing the bandwidth utilization of each link, the
   TE manager can determine the network status, such as which links are
   approaching saturation, which links are rarely used, and where new
   links must be added for supporting traffic increases.

   Based on this analysis, the TE manager can then make decisions on how
   to reallocate the network. Particular cases include:

   (1) Excessive traffic increase in an existing link

      If the utilization of a link is approaching the starvation, the TE
      manager can react by increasing the bandwidth by configuring new
      lightpath(s) between the routers.

   (2) Excessive traffic decrease in an existing link

      If a link is becomes greatly underutilized, its surplus capacity
      can be released to enhance overall network utilization. This can
      be done by releasing unused lightpath(s) between the routers.  The
      released resources are reclaimed, and can be assigned for newly
      created links or increase bandwidth capacity on existing links.

   (3) Excessive traffic increase between ingress and egress routers

      When data traffic between a pair of ingress and egress routers
      increases much and the traffic travels many hops, this situation
      can be relieved by inserting a direct lightpath between these two
      routers.  By doing this, we gain several benefits such as (1) from
      the viewpoint of service quality, the decrement of hop counts
      reduces the possibility of congestion and time delay of data


Hahm et al                                                     [Page 10]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


      traffic, (2) from the viewpoint of network resources, the decrement 
      of the total number of routers involved in passing the data traffic 
      saves network resources such as bandwidth, buffers and label space
      of IP network.



3.3 Control message interchange between network elements

   We design the traffic engineering functions of IP networking and
   those of optical networking in a single system. However, in some
   cases, as when the IP communication service operator and the optical
   networking service operator are different companies, these two
   traffic engineering functions can be divided.

   This section provides a framework for the control messages between
   elements of our architecture.


3.3.1 Routers -> TE Manager


   (1) Link State Information

      TE manager participates in OSPF/ISIS link state advertisements.

3.3.2 TE Manager -> Routers

   The messages issued from the TE manager to routers can be categorized
   as follows.  Here, we simply show the abstract outline of messages.
   Because these messages are not defined yet as a standard, it must be
   developed for the operation.

   (1) Link Insertion

      This message is issued after creating a lightpath between two
      routers which had no direct link before. This message changes the
      existing IP network topology.

   (2) Link Deletion

      This message is issued after deleting the lightpath between two
      routers. After execution of this message, there remains no direct
      link between two routers. This message changes the existing IP
      network topology.

   (3) Bandwidth capacity increase

      This message is issued after creating an additional lightpath
      between two routers which already have a direct link. This message
      does not change the existing IP network topology.



Hahm et al                                                     [Page 11]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


   (4) Bandwidth capacity decrease

      This message is issued after deleting a lightpath between two
      routers which still leaves a direct link between them.  This
      message does not change the existing IP network topology.

      After receiving any of these messages, routers send link state
      information announcing the change of network resources. All these
      messages are exchanged with Link State Advertisement(LSA).


3.3.3 TE Manager -> OXCs

   The functions of these messages were explained in section 2. The
   messages of Link Insertion or Bandwidth Capacity Increase from TE
   manger to routers are implemented by combining Connection and Attach
   Port here. The message of Link Deletion or Bandwidth Capacity
   Decrease are implemented by combining Release Connection and Detach
   Port. After issuing these messages, the TE manager updates the usable
   resources. The functions of each message are explained briefly
   because they have been described in detail above.


   (1) Connect between incoming and outgoing lambda

      This message connects an incoming lambda and an outgoing lambda
      with a lambda switch or lambda converter.

   (2) Release connection

      This message releases an existing connection according to the
      connection id.


   (3) Attach port

      This message connects an incoming lambda of the OXC to an input
      port of the router. An optical-to-electrical conversion is needed
      for this processing.

   (4) Detach port

      This message detaches an output port of the router from an
      outgoing lambda of the OXC. An electrical-to-optical conversion is
      needed for this processing.

   (5) Query

      This message is used to confirm the resource availability of the
      OXC.




Hahm et al                                                     [Page 12]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000



3.3.4 OXCs -> TE Manager

   The function of this message was described in section 2. After
   receiving this message, the TE manager updates the usable resources.


   (1) Alarm

      This message reports the OXC status to the TE manager.  It can be
      used for the disconnection of fibers and lambdas.



4. Traffic Engineering Procedure

   This section shows essential procedures for traffic engineering,
   which are composed of the combination of messages between network
   elements mentioned above. These procedures are focused on the main
   goals of traffic engineering including (1) maximizing utilization,
   (2) provisioning of additional bandwidth capacity in a automatic
   manner, (3) restoration to cope with problems such as the
   disconnection of optical fibers or the malfunction of network
   devices.


4.1 Provisioning of Additional Bandwidth Capacity

   In spite of applying rerouting mechanisms to find additional
   bandwidth capacity in the MPLS environment, a QoS assured path may
   not be found. In this case, an additional lightpath can be inserted
   between routers. In particular, if there is massive bandwidth
   request, (e.g. 5 Gbps), it may well be impossible to assign this
   amount of bandwidth at the MPLS level. In this case, an exclusive
   lightpath between the two routers can be created during service time.


   (a) Ingress router sends the link state information by flooding
   (b) TE manager calculates new lightpath based on available
       optical resources
   (c) TE manager sends the commands to OXCs along the lightpath
   (d) TE manager updates its optical resource table reflecting the
       usage of resources
   (e) TE manager sends the new bandwidth increase or change of topology
       to the corresponding router
   (f) The router floods the new bandwidth resource information (or
       topology change) to every MPLS router
   (g) Every router updates its bandwidth resource table
   (h) Router computes QoS routes based the increased bandwidth capacity


4.2 Restoration


Hahm et al                                                     [Page 13]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


   The link between two routers corresponds to a lightpath, which
   consists of a sequence of switched lambdas. Because each lambda lies
   between two adjacent OXCs, the disconnection of a lightpath means the
   disconnection of a specific lambda. Therefore, when a link is
   disconnected, the corresponding OXC reports the disconnection to the
   TE manager. Then TE manager calculates an alternative lightpath, and
   contacts the OXCs involved in creating the new lightpath.

   Because the input and output ports are not changed during the
   restoration process the MPLS network operation is not influenced from
   this restoration procedure. This procedure is described below.

   (a) OXC reports the disconnection of lambda to TE manager
   (b) TE manager calculates alternative lightpath considering available
       optical resources. The alternative lightpath maintains the input port
       of the sending router and output port of the receiving router
   (c) TE manager sends the control commands to the corresponding OXCs
   (d) TE manager updates its optical resource table reflecting the
       usage of resources
   (e) The data loss is recovered by retransmission

   MPLS links can be disconnected by physical damage to optical cable. A
   single optical cable has many optical fibers, and each optical fiber
   has many lambdas. Each lambda is involved in the individual
   connection between two MPLS routers.  Therefore, the damage of
   optical cable may bring about the disconnection of thousand links in
   MPLS network. The calculation of alternative lightpaths, and the
   negotiation of new lightpaths with each OXC may be impossible in a
   short time.


4.3 Release of Surplus Bandwidth Capacity

   Traffic in the Internet tends to change hour by hour, and day by day.
   So, overdeployed bandwidth must be withdrawn when it is not used
   anymore. Any surplus lightpaths are released for future provisioning
   of bandwidth or restoration processing.

   Even if the link is still transfering traffic (at a low level), the
   release procedure against the link can be executed because the loaded
   traffic is negligible. In this case, the resident traffic is rerouted
   first, and the lightpath is released. The newly assigned route after
   the rerouting process may be longer than former path, but it may
   contribute to the enhancement of total network utilization.


   (a) TE finds that a certain lightpath is not used for a long time
       because many lightpaths are allocated between two routers
   (b) TE manager sends the control messages releasing the lightpath to
       each OXC involving the lightpath.  These messages can be a
       release connection and detach port
   (c) TE sends the new bandwidth decrease or change of topology to the


Hahm et al                                                     [Page 14]


draft-hahm-te-optical-00.txt                                   July 2000


       corresponding router
   (d) The router MPLS TE Manager floods the Bandwidth Resource
       Information (or Topology Change) to every MPLS Router
   (e) Router computes QoS routes based the increased bandwidth


5. Summary

   In this document, we have outlined traffic engineering mechanisms
   that integrate the control planes of MPLS and the WDM-based optical
   networking domain. We discuss the enhancement of traffic engineering
   functionality by using dynamic manipulation of the optical network.

   In the future, we will describe the traffic engineering mechanisms in
   more detail, and develop optical routing algorithms, which can meet
   multiple constraints such as transmission delay (relative to the
   distance between OXCs), the availability of limited network resource
   (incoming and outgoing lambdas, lambda switches, lambda converters,
   and input and output ports).

   We will also focus on risk dispersion algorithms. Such algorithms
   will lower the probability of complete disconnection between two
   adjacent routers by ensuring that lightpaths not travel the same
   optical fiber or optical cable to the extent possible.


Security Considerations

   It is of course essential to maintain secure communication between
   the OXCs and TE manager. However, this document does not address the
   detailed security consideration. It is reserved for future study.
