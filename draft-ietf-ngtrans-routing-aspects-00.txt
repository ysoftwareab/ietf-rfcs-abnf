1. TERMINOLOGY

    This paper uses the following terminology:

    node      - a protocol module that implements IPv4 or IPv6.

    router    - a node that forwards packets not explicitly 
                addressed to itself.

    host      - any node that is not a router.

    border router - a router that forwards packets across
                routing domain boundaries.

    link      - a communication facility or medium over which 
                nodes can communicate at the link layer, i.e., 
                the layer immediately below internet layer.

    interface - a node's attachment to a link.

    address   - an network layer identifier for an interface or 
                a group of interfaces.

    neighbors - nodes attached to the same link.

    routing domain - a collection of routers which coordinate 
                routing knowledge using a single routing
                protocol.

    routing region (or just "region")  - a collection of routers 
                interconnected by a single internet protocol 
                (e.g. IPv6) and coordinating their routing 
                knowledge using routing protocols from a single
                internet protocol stack. A routing region may be 
                a superset of a routing domain.

    tunneling  - encapsulation of protocol A within protocol B, 
                such that A treats B as though it were a 
                datalink layer.

    reachability information - information describing the set of 
                reachable destinations that can be used for
                packet forwarding decisions.

    routing information - same as reachability information.

    address prefix - the high-order bits in an address.

    routing prefix - address prefix that expresses destinations
                which have addresses with the matching address 
                prefixes. It is used by routers to advertise what
                systems they are capable of reaching. 

    route leaking - advertisement of network layer reachability
                information across routing region boundaries.

             

2. ISSUES AND OUTLINE

This internet draft gives an overview of the routing aspects of 
IPv4 to IPv6 transition. The approach outlined here is designed 
to be compatible with the existing mechanisms for IPv6 transition 
[1]. 

During an extended IPv4-to-IPv6 transition period, IPv6-based 
systems must coexist with the installed base of IPv4 systems. In 
such a dual internetworking protocol environment, both IPv4 and 
IPv6 routing infrastructure will be present. Initially, deployed 
IPv6-capable domains might not be globally interconnected via 
IPv6-capable internet infrastructure and therefore may need to 
communicate across IPv4-only routing regions. In order to achieve 
dynamic routing in such a mixed environment, there need to be 
mechanisms to globally distribute IPv6 network layer reachability 
information between dispersed IPv6 routing regions. The same 
techniques can be used in later stages of IPv4-to-IPv6 transition 
to route IPv4 packets between isolated IPv4-only routing region 
over IPv6 infrastructure.

The IPng transition provides a dual-IP-layer transition, augmented 
by use of encapsulation where necessary and appropriate. Routing 
issues related to this transition include:

  (1) Routing for IPv4 packets

  (2) Routing for IPv6 packets 
        (2a) IPv6 packets with IPv6-native addresses
        (2b) IPv6 packets with IPv4-compatible addresses

  (3) Operation of manually configured static tunnels

  (4) Operation of automatic encapsulation
        (4a) Locating encapsulators
        (4b) Ensuring that routing is consist with 
             encapsulation

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



Basic mechanisms required to accomplish these goals include:   
(i) Dual-IP-layer Route Computation; (ii) Manual configuration of 
point-to-point tunnels; and (iii) Route leaking to support 
automatic encapsulation. 

The basic mechanism for routing of IPv4 and IPv6 involves 
dual-IP-layer routing. This implies that routes are separately
calculated for IPv4 addresses and for IPv6 addressing. This is 
discussed in more detail in section 3.1. 

Tunnels (either IPv4 over IPv6, or IPv6 over IPv4) may be manually 
configured. For example, in the early stages of transition this 
may be used to allow two IPv6 domains to interact over an IPv4 
infrastructure. Manually configured static tunnels are treated as 
if they were a normal data link. This is discussed in more detail 
in section 3.2.  

Use of automatic encapsulation requires consistency of routes 
between IPv4 routes and IPv6 routes for destinations using 
IPv4-compatible addresses. For example, consider a packet which 
starts off as an IPv6 packet, but then is encapsulated in an IPv4
packet in the middle of its path from source to destination. This
packet must locate an encapsulator at the correct part of its 
path. Also, this packet has to follow a consistent route for the 
entire path from source to destination. This is discussed in more
detail in section 3.3.



3. MORE DETAIL OF BASIC APPROACHES

3.1 Basic Dual-IP-layer Operation

In the basic dual-IP-layer transition scheme, routers may 
independently support IPv4 and IPv6 routing. Other parts of the 
transition, such as DNS support, and selection by the source host
of which packet format to transmit (IPv4 or IPv6) are discussed 
in [1]. Forwarding of IPv4 packets is based on routes learned 
through running IPv4-specific routing protocols. Similarly, 
forwarding of IPv6 packets (including IPv6-packets with
IPv4-compatible addresses) is based on routes learned through 
running IPv6-specific routing protocols. This implies that 
separate instances of routing protocols are used for IPv4 and for
IPv6 (although note that this could consist of two instances of 
OSPF and/or two instances of RIP, since both OSPF and RIP are 
capable of supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 routing).

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



A minor enhancement would be to use an single instance of an 
integrated routing protocol to support routing for both IPv4 and 
IPv6. At the time that this is written there is no protocol which
has yet been enhanced to support this. This minor enhancement 
does not change the basic dual-IP-layer nature of the transition. 

For initial testing of IPv6 with IPv4-compatible addresses, it 
may be useful to allow forwarding of IPv6 packets without running
any IPv6-compatible routing protocol. In this case, a dual (IPv4 
and IPv6) router could run routing protocols for IPv4 only. It 
then forwards IPv4 packets based on routes learned from IPv4 
routing protocols. Also, it forwards IPv6 packets with an 
IPv4-compatible destination address based on the route for the 
associated IPv4 address. There are a couple of drawbacks with 
this approach: (i) It does not specifically allow for routing of 
IPv6 packets via IPv6-capable routers while avoiding and routing 
around IPv4-only routers; (ii) It does not produce routes for 
"non-compatible" IPv6 addresses. With this method the routing 
protocol does not tell the router whether neighboring routers 
are IPv6-compatible. However, neighbor discovery may be used to
determine this. Then if an IPv6 packet needs to be forwarded to 
an IPv4-only router it can be encapsulated to the destination 
host. 


3.2 Manually Configured Static Tunnels

Tunneling techniques are already widely deployed for bridging 
non-IP network layer protocols (e.g. Appletalk, CLNP, IPX) over 
IPv4 routed infrastructure. IPv4 tunneling is an encapsulation of
arbitrary packets inside IPv4 datagrams that are forwarded over 
IPv4 infrastructure between tunnel endpoints. For a tunneled 
protocol, a tunnel appears as a single-hop link (i.e. routers 
that establish a tunnel over a network layer infrastructure can 
inter-operate over the tunnel as if it were a one-hop, point-to-
point link). Once a tunnel is established, routers at the tunnel 
endpoints can establish routing adjacencies and exchange routing 
information.  Describing the protocols for performing 
encapsulation is outside the scope of this paper (see [1]).
Static point-to-point tunnels may also be established between a 
host and a router, or between two hosts. Again, each manually 
configured point-to-point tunnel is treated as if it was a simple
point-to-point link. 

In order for an IPv6 router to be able to encapsulate IPv6 
packets into IPv4 datagrams and to forward encapsulated packets 
over an IPv4 tunnel, such a router must also be able to speak

IPv4 (i.e. must be a dual router). The route tunneling technique 
requires dual routers to be deployed at boundaries between 
adjacent IPv6-capable and IPv4-only routing regions:

                      
   ~~~~~ IPv6 region ~~~~~               ~~~~~ IPv6 region ~~~~~
                      |                     |
                 dual router             dual router
                      |        tunnel       |

                      ~~~~~ IPv4 region ~~~~~
                   
       Figure 1: Example of Manually Configured Tunnel


Forwarding of IPv6 packets between IPv6 routing domains is 
straightforward -- when a packet reaches a border router, the 
border router examines it's routing database to find an interface
to the next-hop router. If the forwarding interface is connected 
to a tunneled link, the packet must be encapsulated into an IPv4 
datagram according to the adopted encapsulation scheme, and the 
resulting datagram is forwarded over the tunnel. Intermediate 
IPv4 routers between the tunnel endpoints forward the datagram as
they would any other IPv4 datagram, using information in the 
encapsulating header. The recipient border router, in an adjacent
IPv6 region, strips off the encapsulating header and forwards the
original IPv6 packets toward its ultimate destination. Note that 
the destination and source addresses in the encapsulating header 
are the IPv4 addresses of the tunnel endpoints, not derivatives 
of the destination and source addresses of the encapsulated IPv6 
packet.

In the route tunneling scheme described here, there is a complete
separation of the IPv6 network reachability information from the 
IPv4 routing information; i.e. this is a dual-IP-layer approach. 
Nevertheless, an IPv4 routing region and an IPv6 routing region 
can overlap. Each such region can share routers which support 
both IPv4 and IPv6 routing. 

There are the following advantages to employ manually configured 
tunneling for exchanging datagrams and routing information:

  - The underlying infrastructure which furnishes a tunnel link
    is transparent to protocols that are bridged with the tunnel
    (i.e. there is no changes to tunneled protocols).

  - All types of IPv6 route prefixes without exception can be

    advertised with routing protocols. Therefore, no restriction
    needs to be imposed on formats of the addresses in IPv6
    packets that can be routed with this scheme.

  - If a connectivity between IPv6 nodes is all that needed, only
    border routers at boundaries with IPv4-only routing regions 
    need to be dual protocol routers.

  - Since IPv6 packets are encapsulated only when they travel
    over network segments that don't support IPv6, and are 
    forwarded according to their native headers anywhere else,
    this method does not constrain the types of policy routing 
    which may be employed over the IPv6 portion of the data path. 

  - Routers from major vendors already support the multiprotocol
    operation that is needed at tunnel endpoints.

  - Since a manually configured point to point tunnel works like
    any normal point to point link, IPv6 multicast works over
    manually configured point to point tunnels. No enhancement 
    nor change to IPv6 multicast is needed for this purpose. 

 The disadvantages of manually configured tunneling are that:

  - Tunnels need to be manually configured.

  - Manually configured tunnels are inherently point-to-point. 
    This may be a drawback in a region where for example a large 
    number of (IPv6-capable) dual hosts need to communicate over
    an IPv4 infrastructure with a small number of (IPv6-capable) 
    dual routers. 

  - Tunnels may circumvent security firewalls of the 
    encapsulating infrastructure -- only addresses of the tunnel
    endpoints are normally visible to such firewalls, not actual
    attributes of the encapsulated packets.  Note that the same 
    stands true for automatic tunneling described in the next 
    section. 

  - Since a tunnel may appear as a one-hop link, some routing 
    protocols may prefer a tunnel over a real multi-hop link.
    Therefore, IPv6 packets may be routed across an IPv4 routing 
    region even when an alternative homogeneous IPv6 path is 
    available. Note that this disadvantage may be eliminated by
    using a routing protocol such as OSPF which allows a 
    considerable dynamic range of metric values to be assigned 
    to links.

Though this section describes tunneling of IPv6 routing 
information and IPv6 packets over IPv4 infrastructure, when a 
need arises for IPv4 routing regions to communicate via IPv6 
routing infrastructure, the similar tunneling technique can be 
used -- except IPv4 packets will be encapsulated within IPv6 
datagrams.


3.3  Automatic Tunnels

Automatic tunneling allows the addresses of one or both tunnel 
endpoints to be determined automatically from the IPv6 source and
destination addresses. Automatic tunneling is based on use of 
IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses, and is only applicable for IPv6 
over IPv4 use (i.e., for encapsulating an IPv6 packet within an 
IPv4 header in order to allow the packet to be forwarded via 
IPv4-only routers).

Automatic tunneling may be used for IPv6 packets when either 
source or destination hosts (or both) do not have any adjacent 
IPv6-capable router. Note that by "adjacent router", this 
includes routers which are logically adjacent by virtue of a 
manually configured point-to-point tunnel (which is treated as 
if it is a simple point-to-point link). In order for automatic 
tunneling to work, any host which does not have any local 
adjacent IPv6-capable router must have an IPv4-compatible IPv6 
address assigned to it. 

With automatic tunneling, the resulting IPv4 packet is forwarded 
by IPv4 routers as a normal IPv4 packet, using IPv4 routes 
learned from routing protocols. There are therefore no special 
issues related to IPv4 routing in this case. There are however 
routing issues relating to how IPv6 routing works in a manner 
which is compatible with automatic tunneling, and how tunnel 
endpoint addresses are selected during the encapsulation process. 
Automatic tunneling is useful from a source host to
the destination host, from a source host to a router, and from
a router to the destination host. Mechanisms for automatic 
tunneling from a router to another router are not currently 
defined. 


3.3.1 Host to Host Automatic Tunneling

If both source and destination hosts make use of IPv4-compatible 
IPv6 addresses, then it is possible for automatic tunneling to be
used for the entire path from the source host to the destination 



Expires April 1996                                            [Page 8]

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



host. In this case, the IPv6 packet is encapsulated in an IPv4 
packet by the source host, and is forwarded by routers as an IPv4
packet all the way to the destination host. This allows initial 
deployment of IPv6-capable hosts to be done prior to the update 
of any routers.  

A source host may make use of Host to Host automatic tunneling 
provided that the following are both true:

  - the source address is an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address.
  - the destination address is an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address.
  - the source host does know of one or more neighboring IPv4-
    capable routers, or the source and destination are on the    
    same subnet. 

If all of these requirements are true, then the source host may 
encapsulate the IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet, using a source 
IPv4 address which is extracted from the associated source IPv6
address, and using a destination IPv4 address which is extracted
from the associated destination IPv6 address. 

Where host to host automatic tunneling is used, the packet is 
forwarded as a normal IPv4 packet for its entire path, and is 
decapsulated (i.e., the IPv4 header is removed) only by the 
destination host. 

If the source host knows of any neighboring IPv6-capable router, 
or if the source and destination hosts are on the same subnet, 
then it is not necessary to use host to host automatic tunneling. 
In this case other means of forwarding the packet are possible.
This document does not specify the preference between various
forms of forwarding the packet (such as the preference between 
end to end encapsulation of IPv6 in IP versus using native IPv6
for part of the path and encapsulation for part of the path). 


3.3.2 Host to Router Configured Default Tunneling

In some cases "configured default" tunneling may be used to 
encapsulate the IPv6 packet for transmission from the source 
host to an IPv6-backbone. However, this requires that the 
source host be configured with an IPv4 address to use for 
tunneling to the backbone. 

Configured default tunneling is particularly useful if the 
source host does not know of any local IPv6-capable router 



Expires April 1996                                            [Page 9]

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



(implying that the packet cannot be forwarded as a normal 
IPv6 packet directly over the link layer), and when the 
destination host does not have an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address 
(implying that host to host tunneling cannot be used). 

Host to router configured default tunneling may optionally 
also be used even when the host does know of a local IPv6 
router. In this case it is a policy decision whether the 
host prefers to send a native IPv6 packet to the IPv6-capable 
router or prefers to send an encapsulated packet to the 
configured tunnel endpoint. 

Similary host to router default configured tunneling may be 
used even when the destination address is an IPv4-compatible 
IPv6 address. In this case for example a policy decision may
be made to prefer tunneling for part of the path and native
IPv6 for part of the path, or alternatively to use tunneling 
for the entire path from source host to destination host. 

A source host may make use of host to router configured default
tunneling provided that ALL of the following are true:

  - the source address is an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address.
  - the source host does know of one or more neighboring IPv4-
    capable routers
  - the source host has been configured with an IPv4 address of
    an dual router which can serve as the tunnel endpoint. 

If all of these requirements are true, then the source host may 
encapsulate the IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet, using a source 
IPv4 address which is extracted from the associated source IPv6 
address, and using a destination IP address which corresponds to 
the configured address of the dual router which is serving as
the tunnel endpoint. 

When host to router configured default tunneling is used, the 
packet is forwarded as a normal IPv4 packet from the source host 
to the dual router serving as tunnel endpoint, is decapsulated by 
the dual router, and is then forwarded as a normal IPv6 packet by
the tunnel endpoint. 

If the destination address is also IPv4-compatible, then an
alternate method in this case is to use end to end automatic 
tunneling. If the source host does know of at least one 
neighboring IPv6-capable router, then an alternate method in this 
case is for the source host to forward a native IPv6 packet to 
the IPv6-capable router.

3.3.2.1 Routing to the Endpoint for the Configured Default Tunnel 
 
The dual router which is serving as the end point of the host to
router configured default tunnel must advertise reachability into 
IPv4 routing sufficient to cause the encapsulated packet to be 
forwarded to it. 

The simplest approach is for a single IPv4 address to be assigned
to the router for use as a tunnel endpoint. The dual router which
has connectivity to the IPv6 backbone and which is capable of 
serving as tunnel endpoint advertises a host route to this 
address into IPv4 routing in the IPv4-only region. Each dual host
in the associated IPv4-only region is configured with the address
of this tunnel endpoint. 

In some cases there may be multiple dual routers which can server
as endpoints for configured default tunneling from any one IPv4-
only region. In this case again each host may again be configured 
with a single address representing the tunnel endpoint. However, 
all dual routers with connectivity to the IPv6 backbone which are 
capable of serving as configured tunnel endpoints from this 
region must advertise a host route to the associated IPv4 
address. This allows encapsulating packets using host to router 
configured default tunneling to be forwarded to the tunnel 
endpoint that is selected by the local routing policy (for 
example, the nearest tunnel end point, based on whatever metric(s) 
the local routing protocol is using). 

Finally, in some cases there may be some reason for specific 
hosts to prefer one of several tunnel endpoints, while allowing 
all potential tunnel endpoints to serve as backups in case the 
preferred endpoint is not reachable. In this case, each dual 
router with IPv6 backbone connectivity which is serving as 
potential tunnel endpoint is given a unique IPv4 address taken 
from a single IPv4 address block (where the IPv4 address block is
assigned either to the organization administering the IPv4-only 
region, or to the organization administering the local part of 
the IPv6 backbone). In the likely case that there are much less 
than 250 such dual routers serving as tunnel endpoints, we 
suggest using multiple IPv4 addresses selected from a single 
24-bit IPv4 address prefix for this purpose. Each dual router 
then advertises two routes into the IPv4 region: A host route 
corresponding to the tunnel endpoint address specifically 
assigned to it, and also a standard (prefix) route to the 
associated IPv4 address block. Each dual host in the IPv4-only 
region is configured with a tunnel endpoint address which 
corresponds to the preferred tunnel endpoint for it to use. If

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



the associated dual router is operating, then the packet will 
be delivered to it based upon the host route that it is 
advertising into the IPv4-only region. However, if the 
associated dual router is down, but some other dual router 
serving as potential tunnel endpoint is operating, then the 
packet will be delivered to the nearest operating tunnel 
endpoint. 


3.3.3 Router to Host Automatic Tunneling

In some cases the source host may have direct connectivity to one
or more IPv6-capable routers, but the destination host might not 
have direct connectivity to any IPv6-capable router. In this 
case, provided that the destination host has an IPv4-compatible 
IPv6 address, normal IPv6 forwarding may be used for part of the 
packet's path, and router to host tunneling may be used to get 
the packet from an encapsulating dual router to the destination 
host. 

In this case, the operation of the encapsulating router is 
straightforward. The encapsulating router creates the 
encapsulating IPv4 header using an IPv4 address assigned to 
itself as the source IPv4 address, and using a destination IPv4 
address extracted from the destination IPv4-compatible IPv6 
address. The encapsulated packet is forwarded from the 
encapsulating router to the destination host using normal IPv4 
routing. 

In this case, the hard part is the IPv6 routing required to 
deliver the IPv6 packet from the source host to the encapsulating
router. For this to happen, somehow the encapsulating router has 
to advertise reachability for the appropriate IPv4-compatible 
IPv6 addresses into the IPv6 routing region. There are several 
options for how this may be accomplished: 

 (1) Implicit Routes based on IPv4 Routing

  IPv4 routing will be used in the dual region to calculate  
  routes for IPv4 packets. It is possible (as mentioned in 
  section 3.1) to also use this to implicitly calculate routes 
  for IPv6 packets with IPv4-compatible addresses. In the case 
  that there is a boundary between a dual region and an IPv4-only
  region, it is necessary for the dual routers at the boundary to
  know that they are on the boundary, and that some neighboring

  border routers, or may be determined through neighbor discovery. 
  As mentioned in section 3.1, this approach is limited in   
  usefulness. For example, it does not allow use of the full IPv6
  address space.

 (2) Implicit Routes for V4-compatible addresses Plus V6-routing

  The solution 1 above may be enhanced by also running native 
  IPv6 routing for "native IPv6 addresses" (i.e., for addresses 
  which are not IPv4-compatible). In this case IPv6 packets with 
  v4-compatible addresses would be routed using routes calculated
  by IPv4 routing, and other IPv6 packets would be routed using 
  routes calculated by IPv6 routing. 

 (3) Route Leaking

  With this approach, all IPv6 packets (including those with  
  IPv4-compatible addresses) are routed using routes calculated  
  from native IPv6 routing. This implies that encapsulating 
  routers need to advertise into IPv6 routing specific route 
  entries corresponding to any IPv4 addresses which can be 
  reached in an neighboring IPv4-only region. This requires 
  manual configuration of the encapsulating routers to control 
  which routes are to be leaked into IPv6 routing protocols. 

Depending upon the extent of the IPv4-only and dual routing 
regions, the leaking of routes may be relatively simple or may be
more complex. For example, consider a dual Internet backbone, 
connected via one or two dual routers to an IPv4-only stub 
routing domain. In this case, it is likely that there is already 
one summary address prefix which is being advertised into the 
Internet backbone in order to summarize IPv4 reachability to the 
stub domain. With approaches 1 and 2, advertising this one prefix
into IPv4 routing in the backbone implies that the same border 
routers can also route IPv6 packets with corresponding 
IPv4-compatible addresses into the same stub domain. With 
approach 3, the border routers would be configured to announce 
the IPv4 address prefix into the IPv4 routing within the 
backbone, and also announce the corresponding IPv4-compatible 
IPv6 address prefix into IPv6 routing within the backbone. 

A more difficult case involves the border between a major 
Internet backbone which is IPv4-only, and a major Internet 
backbone which supports both IPv4 and IPv6. In this case, use of 
the third approach requires that either (i) the entire IPv4 
routing table be fed into IPv6 routing in the dual routing domain
(implying a doubling of the size of the routing tables in the 
dual domain); or (ii) Manual configuration is required to 
determine which of the addresses contained in the Internet

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



routing table include one or more IPv6-capable systems, and only 
these addresses be advertised into IPv6 routing in the dual 
domain. 

In some cases it is possible that some but not all of the dual 
routers at a boundary between regions are capable of 
encapsulation. In this case it is necessary that the IPv6 packets
with IPv4-compatible destination addresses are forwarded to the 
correct boundary router (just any boundary router is not 
sufficient). However, in this case native IPv4 packets traversing
the dual region destined for within the IPv4-only region may be 
forwarded to any border router. In this case, the first two 
solutions above are not feasible. Rather, manual configuration of 
route leaking from IPv4 routing into IPv6 routing must be used. 
Only those border routers which are actually capable of automatic
tunneling may leak routes in this case. It is recommended that 
this situation be avoided, by having all routers at borders 
between regions be capable of doing automatic tunneling. 

Dual routers which implement option 2 above when forwarding IPv6 
packets with IPv4-compatible addresses MUST give preference to 
routes which are obtained directly from v6 routing, and only use 
the routes implied from IPv4 routing as a last resort. This allows
explicit routes to be fed into IPv6 routing at those places where 
the border routers between regions are not all capable of 
automatic tunneling, but allows implicit routes based on IPv4 
routing to be used in other cases. Clearly specifying the order of
preference of routes in this case is necessary in order to prevent
looping. 


3.3.4 Operation when Multiple Methods are Feasible

There may be some cases in which more than one of the forms of
communications described here are feasible. In this case, the
decision regarding which form is to be used in any one actually
case is a policy decision, and is outside of the scope of this
document. 

One example of this may occur if both source and destination
hosts have IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses, and where both 
source and destination hosts have connectivity to both IPv4 and 
IPv6 routers. In this case it is possible to either use native
IPv6 on an end to end (host to host) basis, or to use IPv6 
encapsulated over IPv4 on a host to host basis. Which method to 
use in any one case may be decided via policy mechanisms which

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



are outside of the scope of this document. As one example of a 
policy mechanism which could in principle be used in this case: 
(i) A host might be configured to always use native IPv6 in this 
case; (ii) A host may be configured to use IPv6 first but then 
switch to IPv4 encapsulation if an error condition arises; (ii)
A host may be configured to use IPv4 encapsulation first but 
switch to IPv6 if an error condition arises; or (iv) A host may
be configured to always use IPv4 encapsulation. It is not 
necessary to use the same approach in each direction. 

Another example occurs where an IPv6-capable host has no local
IPv6 router, where the host has been configured with the address 
of a default configured tunnel endpoint, and where both source 
and destination addresses are IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses. In 
this case an IPv6 packet may be transmitted by the host either 
using host to host tunneling or using host to router tunneling. 
Again, which form of tunneling to prefer in this case is a 
policy mechanism and is not specified in this specification. 
	

3.3.5 Example of How Automatic Tunnels May be Combined

Clearly tunneling is useful only if communication can be 
achieved in both directions. However, different forms of 
tunneling may be used in each direction, depending upon the 
local environment, the form of address of the two hosts which 
are exchanging IPv6 packets, and the policies in use.

Table 1 summarizes the form of tunneling that will result given 
each possible combination of host capabilities, and given one 
possible set of policy decisions. This table is derived directly 
from the requirements for automatic tunneling discussed above. 

The example in table 1 uses a specific set of policy decisions:
It is assumed in table 1 that the source host will transmit a 
native IPv6 where possible in preference over encapsulation. It 
is also assumed that where tunneling is needed, host to host 
tunneling will be preferred over host to router tunneling. Other
combinations are therefore possible if other policies are used.

Note that IPv6-capable hosts which do not have any local IPv6 
router must be given an IPv4-compatible v6 address in order to 
make use of their IPv6 capabilities. Thus, there are no entries 
for IPv6-capable hosts which have an incompatible IPv6 address 
and which also do not have any connectivity to any local IPv6 
router. In fact, such hosts could communicate with other IPv6 
hosts on the same local network without the use of a router.

However, since this internet draft focuses on routing and router 
implications of IPv6 transition, direct communication between two
hosts on the same local network without any intervening router is
outside the scope of this internet draft. 

Also, table 1 does not consider manually configured 
point-to-point tunnels. Such tunnels are treated as if they were 
normal point-to-point links. Thus any two IPv6-capable devices 
which have a manually configured tunnel between them may be 
considered to be directly connected.

4. EXAMPLE 

Figure 2 illustrates an example network with two regions A and B. 
Region A is dual, meaning that the routers within region A are 
capable of forwarding both IPv4 and IPv6. Region B is IPv4-only, 
implying that the routers within region B are capable of routing 
only IPv4. The illustrated routers R1 through R4 are dual. The 
illustrated routers r5 through r9 are IP-only. Also assume

that hosts H3 through H8 are dual. Thus H7 and H8 have been 
upgraded to be IPv6-capable, even though they exist in a region 
in which the routers are not IPv4-capable. However, host h1 and 
h2 are IPv4-only.

Consider a packet from h1 to H8. In this case, since h1 is IPv4-
only, it will send an IPv4 packet. This packet will traverse 
regions A and B as a normal IPv4 packet for the entire path. 
Routing will take place using normal IPv4 routing methods, with 
no change from the operation of the current IPv4 Internet (modulo
normal advances in the operation of IPv4, of course). Similarly, 
consider a return packet from H8 to h1. Here again H8 will 
transmit an IPv4 packet, which will be forwarded as a normal IPv4
packet for the entire path. 

Consider a packet from H3 to H8. In this case, since H8 is in an 
IPv4-only routing domain, we can assume that H8 uses an 
IPv4-compatible IPv6 address. Since both source and destination are 
IPv6-capable, H3 may transmit an IPv6 packet destined to H8. The
packet will be forwarded as far as R2 (or R4) as an IPv6 packet. 

Router R2 (or R4) will then encapsulate the full IPv6 packet in 
an IPv4 header for delivery to H8. In this case it is necessary 
for routing of IPv6 within region A to be capable of delivering 
this packet correctly to R2 (or R4). As explained in section 3.3,
this may either make use of implicit routes (using the v4 routing
within region A to provide routes for IPv6 packets with
IPv4-compatible addresses), or routers R2 and R4 may leak routes 
to IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses into the v6 routing used within 
region A corresponding to the routes which are available via IPv4
routing within region B.

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



Consider a return packet from H8 to H3. Again, since both source 
and destination are IPv6-capable, a V6 packet may be transmitted
by H8. However, since H8 does not have any direct connectivity to
an IPv6-capable router, H8 must make use of an automatic tunnel. 
Which form of automatic tunnel will be used depends upon the type
of address assigned to H3. 

If H3 is assigned an IPv4-compatible address, then the 
requirements specified in section 3.3.1 will all be satisfied. In
this case host H8 may encapsulate the full IPv6 packet in an 
IPv4 header using a source IPv4 address extracted from the IPv6 
address of H8, and using a destination IPv4 address extracted 
from the IPv6 address of H3. 

If H3 has an incompatible IPv6 address, then it is not possible 
for H8 to extract an IPv4 address to use as the destination 
tunnel address from the IPv6 address of H3. In this case H8 must 
use host to router tunneling, as specified in section 3.3.2. In 
this case one or both of R2 and R4 must have been configured with
a tunnel endpoint IPv4 address (R2 and R4 may use either the same
address or different addresses for this purpose). R2 and/or R4 
therefore advertise reachability to the tunnel endpoint address to r5 
and r6 (respectively), which advertise this reachability information
into region B. Also, H8 must have been configured to know which 
tunnel endpoint address to use for host to router tunneling. This
will result in the IPv6 packet, encapsulated in an IPv4 header, 
to be transmitted as far as the border router R2 or R4. The 
border router will then strip off the IPv4 header, and forward 
the remaining IPv6 packet as a normal IPv6 packet using the 
normal IPv6 routing used in region A. 


5. INTERACTION BETWEEN IPv4 AND IPv6 INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING

As discussed above, if route leaking is employed then IPv4 routes
which are acquired by an inter-region dual router may need to be 
injected into an IPv6 routing region. Such an inter-region dual 
router may use BGP-4 for IPv4 inter-domain routing. Since the 
Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) has been adopted for IPv6 
inter-domain routing, IDRP may need to be used to propagate the 
IPv4 route into IPv6 routing. 

When routes learned with BGP are injected into IDRP, it would be 
highly desirable to preserve routing attributes associated with 
the routes in order to minimize the effect of the inter-region 
route leaking onto the routing integrity. Since practically all 
routing attributes that are carried in BGP-4 are also present in

Internet Draft     Routing Aspects Of IPv6 Transition     October 1995



IDRP, the mapping of the BGP-4 attributes to the IDRP attributes 
is straightforward. However, since addresses and routing domain 
identifiers that are carried by IDRP and BGP-4 are assigned from 
different number spaces there is a need to ensure that 32-bit 
IPv4 addresses and 16-bit routing domain identifiers (Autonomous 
System numbers in IPv4 terminology) are uniquely represented in 
the larger IPv6 number space. 

It has been already agreed that IPv6 addresses with 96 leading 
zero bits are reserved to represent addresses assigned from the 
IPv4 address space. Since IPv6 domain identifiers are allocated 
from the 128-bit IPv6 address space, it will be natural to 
reserve IPv6 addresses (for use as routing domain identifiers) 
with 112 leading zero bits to uniquely represent IPv4 Autonomous 
System numbers. 


6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Use of tunneling may violate firewalls of underlying routing 
infrastructure.

No other security issues are discussed in this paper.
