Abstract

   We consider Internet connectivity of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET),
   where two or more fixed or mobile nodes (MNs) may have a wired or
   wireless interface to the fixed Internet in addition to the wireless
   interface for the MANET.  The points of attachment of MNs to the
   Internet are termed as "Access Routers (ARs)," A stationary MN, that
   has wired connection with the Internet may become an AR itself.
   Typically, only a single AR is used as the Internet Gateway (IGW) in
   a MANET.  Two or more IGWs may be used, but the number of the IGWs
   should be kept to a minimim.  This minimizing feature is named
   "Gateway Aggregation."  MANET routing protocol runs on the MBGs, and
   both routing control messages and data packets of the MANET are
   tunneled between an MN and its associated AR, between an AR and its
   selected IGW, and also between an IGW and its peer IGW.  The IGW
   advertises the network prefix for the MNs to configure their global
   care-of-addresses.  An MN configures its care-of-address with the
   prefix advertised by one of the IGWs.  Once it obtains its global
   address, it does not have to change it during its stay in the MANET.

1.  Introduction

   Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) may have temporary or continuous
   Internet connectivity so that the mobile nodes (MNs) can exchange
   data packets with the nodes in the Internet (Internet nodes).  In the
   simplest case, a single MN also has the wired or wireless interface
   to the Internet and works as the Internet Gateway (IGW).  It thus
   advertises the network prefix for the MNs to configure their care-of-
   addresses.  In more complex cases, multiple nodes in the MANET may
   have an interface to the Internet and work as the IGW.  In this case,
   each IGW advertises its network prefix to the MNs and an MN needs to
   select its IGW, when receiving gateway information from two or more
   IGWs [2], [3].  Typically, a node should select the closest IGW in
   terms of the number of hops for communication efficiency.  It is
   therefore desirable for the node to re-select a different IGW when
   the current IGW is not appropriate as the result of roaming.  The
   node then needs to configure its new care-of-address based on the
   network prefix advertised by the new IGW.  However, firstly, it is
   not convenient for the node to change its IP address frequently for
   the purpose of maintaining its communication sessions.  Secondly, it
   takes some time for the MANET to reconstruct routes in which this
   nodes is directly (as the source or destination) or indirectly (as
   the relay nodes) involved.

   With regard to the first issue, no previously proposed methods can
   completely avoid the possibility of address change.  With regard to
   the second issue, two approaches have been recently proposed.  In the
   first approach, each node configures multiple care-of-addresses based
   on the received prefixes and advertises all of them throughout the
   MANET so that the routing protocol maintains all routes to the
   multiple addresses [4].  When a node changes its address to one of
   the advertised addresses, all other nodes will already have
   maintained the route to this address.  In the second approach, data
   packets are tunneled between the MNs and the selected GWs in both
   directions.  MANET-local addresses are used for forwarding packets
   within the MANET [5].  The result is that no route reconstruction
   needs to be performed when any MANET node changes its global address.

   In this document, we propose a novel method, called "Gateway
   Aggregation Protocol (GAP)" to realize the Internet connectivity of a
   MANET, where the number of IGWs are kept minimized and the nodes in
   the MANET do not have to change their care-of-IP addresses regardless
   of roaming, simultaneously solving the two issues mentioned above.
   Note that the registration mechanisms and the related descriptions
   given in this document are mostly inspired by [5].

2.  Terminology

   MANET: Mobile ad hoc network

   MN: A node located inside a MANET.

   Access router (AR): The point of attachment of an MN to the Internet.

   MBG: MANET Border Gateway.  This node has two or more interfaces and
   has a connectivity both to a AR and to a MANET.

   Internet node: A node located within the Internet (outside MANET).

   Default route: All the packets for destinations not known by the
   router's routing table are sent to the default route.  The default
   route address in IPv4 (in CIDR notation) is 0.0.0.0/0, and in IPv6 is
   given by ::/0.

   Anchor MBG: A MBG which is advertising the default route to the
   MANET.

   Internet gateway (IGW): A router which provides Internet connectivity
   for MNs.

   MANET-local address: A unique-local address having scope that is
   limited to the MANET.

   Global address: A node's IP address in the Internet, typically
   resolvable from a DNS name.  The address identifies the mobile node,
   and is used for communication to the Internet.  It can also be used
   for communication within the MANET.

   IGW advertisement: A message to disseminate IGW information to a
   MANET.

3.  Overview

   We consider a MANET that MAY have one or more MNs, that have a wired
   or wireless interface to the fixed Internet in addition to the
   wireless interface to the MNs.  The points of attachment of MNs to
   the Internet are termed as "MANET border gateways (MBGs)," and they
   are assigned global prefix from their Access Routers (ARs).  In the
   conventional methods, any MBG is qualified to be an Internet gateway
   (IGW).  On the other hand, in this document, only a subset of MBGs
   MAY work as the IGWs.  This MBG is named Anhor MBG.  Specifically, a
   MBG MAY work as the IGW for outbound (from the MANET to the Internet)
   traffic but MUST not work as the IGW for inbound (from the Internet
   to the MANET) traffic, except when it is Anchor MBG.  When A MBG
   itself communicates as the source or destination with the Internet
   nodes, it SHOULD directly send and receive packets to and from the
   Internet nodes without depending on the Anchor MBG, since they are
   directly attached to the Internet.  Typically, a single Anchor MBG is
   used for a MANET, even if multiple MBGs exist.  This feature is
   called "Gateway Aggregation."  In rare occasions, two or more MBGs
   MAY be used, but the number of the Anchor MBGs SHOULD be kept
   minimized.  It is assumed that each MN has configured a MANET-local
   address.  A MN needs a globally routable address (care-of-address)
   with prefix advertised by one of the ARs so that it can receive data
   packets from an Internet node.  Some Autoconf protocol MAY be used
   for global prefix advertisement and address assignment to the MANET
   MNs.  But global address assignment to the MANET MNs is out of scope
   of this specification.

   Unlike the conventional methods, MANET routing protocol runs not only
   on MNs but on MBGs as well and routing control messages and data
   packets within the MANET are tunneled between MBGs in both
   directions.  This can be achieved by IP-in-IP encapsulation [6].  ARs
   advertise their global prefix and MBGs in turn advertise them to the
   MNs using some autoconf protocol.  Upon receiving the prefix from an
   AR, an MN configures its care-of-address and can receive packets from
   an Internet node through the MBG.

   In the proposed method, multiple MBGs connected to the same MANET
   SHOULD select the same MBG named Anchor MBG in the distributed-
   fashion.  When an MBG starts to work, it first becomes Anchor MBG,
   and at the same time, it continues monitoring whether there exists
   another Anchor MBG serving the MANET based on the default route
   information it receives through the MANET.  If it is the case, it
   generate Gateway Aggregation Request and try to establishes a tunnel
   with the newly detected Anchor MBG through the Internet.

   In this architecture, MBGs, that are attached to the Internet, are
   not directly used as the IGWs unlike the conventional Internet access

   architecture of the MANET and, therefore, a communication path
   between a MN and an Internet node may be longer since it has to pass
   through the selected IGW.  However, it is natural that MNs exist in a
   geographically limited area and this path overhead can be negligible.

   It is possible that two independent MANETs, each of which has a
   different Anchor MBG, merges to form a single connected MANET.  In
   this case, the MANET routing protocol of each Anchor MBG can be aware
   of each other by receiving the default route advertisements through
   the MANET.  After that, they establish a tunnel to each other so that
   they are neighbors of each other in the MANET.  It is also possible
   that two or more MBGs are installed in the same MANET simultaneously.
   In this case, each MBGs may become itself as Anchor MBG, but they
   soon detect and aggregate each other. as the results, single Anchor
   MBG remains in the MANET.  Each MBG has its own prefix and
   distributes its prefix within the MANET by using some of Autoconf
   protocol.  An MN may configure its care-of-address using Autoconf
   protocol from one of the MBGs.  It then can continue to use this
   care-of-address throughout the MANET and no address change is
   required.

   There are notable differences between the conventional methods
   [2]-[5] and the GAP.  First, in conventional methods, an MN with
   attachment to the Internet is simultaneously an IGW.  On the other
   hand, in GAP, IGW is selected from ARs and the number of the IGWs is
   kept minimized.  In the ideal case, only a single IGW is used to
   disseminate its own prefix.  Second, in conventional method, an MN
   may change its global address for communication efficiency under
   multiple IGWs environment and special care must be taken to suppress
   route reconstruction [4], [5], giving rise to overhead within the
   MANET.  On the other hand, in the GAP, an MN does not have to change
   its global address, once assigned, even if multiple IGWs exist and AR
   selection is automatically performed by making best use of the MANET
   routing protocol.  As the result, no route reconstruction occurs.
   This benefit is brought at the cost of overhead within the Internet
   (possible detours and tunneling).  This shift of the overhead for
   suppressing route reconstruction from within MANET to within the
   Internet is beneficial since bandwidth resource in the MANET is more
   expensive than that in the Internet.  Network overview of GAP is
   shown in Fig. 1. and a procedure of gateway aggregation of MBGs is
   presented in Fig. 2.

7.  Protocol Operation

7.1.  Protocol Operation Overview

   This protocol only specifies how to aggregate MBGs at a Internet
   connected MANET.  Thus, how MNs in the MANET get global prefixes or
   how MBGs get global prefixes is out of scope in this specification.
   A MBG is assigned a global prefix from its AR by some way (i.e.
   router advertisement mechanism or DHCP might be used), and a MBG
   advertises its global prefix to the attached MANET.  At the same
   time, the MANET routing protocol which is run on the MBGs are
   configured to announce to the MANET the default route and becomes
   Anchor MBG itself if there are no Anchor MBG exists in the MANET.
   The MANET routing protocol should always check whether there is
   another Anchor MBG that is announcing the default route in the MANET
   or not.  If a Anchor MBG detects another Anchor MBG which is
   announcing the default route, the Anchor MBG sends a Gateway
   Aggregation Request message to the other Anchor MBG and tries to
   establish an IP-in-IP tunnel through the internet.  After tunnel
   establishment, one of the Anchor MBG reconfigures its MANET routing
   protocol to stop announcing the default route and becomes normal MBG
   itself.  The MANET messages are able to be exchanged through the
   tunnel and MNs can communicate to an Internet node by way of the
   nearest MBG that is selected by the MANET routing protocol.  It is
   also possible for MNs that one global IP address first assigned from
   the nearest ARs can be used continuously even if the MN moves and
   MANET routing protocol changes the path betwem the MN and an Internet
   node through an alternative MBG.

7.2.  Global Prefix Assgnment to MN

   MBG advertises global prefix to the attached MANET and MN can be
   assigned one or more global addresses by use of Autoconf protocol.
   How MN gets global address is out of scope of this specification.

7.3.  Other MBG Detection

   In this protocol, MANET routing protocol is used to detect other
   Anchor MBGs that is announcing the default route.  In proactive
   routing protocols such as OLSRv2 or OLSR, it is easy to know of other
   Anchor MBGs because proactive routing protocol advertises the default
   route continuously.  But for reactive routing protocols such as DYMO
   or AODV, Anchor MBGs MAY be require to generate route requests to the
   default route periodically.  When the MANET routing protocol newly
   detects other Anchor MBG, the MANET routing protocol gives the new
   Anchor MBG information (such as global IP address list of MBG) to the
   GAP protocol.

7.4.  Gateway Aggregation Request

   Gateway Aggregation Request messages are generated by the Anchor MBG
   to the newly detected Anchor MBG from the interface that is connected
   to the AR when the Anchor MBG received a newly detected Anchor MBG
   information from MANET routing protocol.  The Gateway Aggregation
   Request messages include the number of tunnels the request-originator
   MBG has.

7.5.  Gateway Aggregation Response

   The MBG that received the Gateway Aggregation Request generates a
   Gateway Aggregation Response message in response to the Gateway
   Aggregation Request message.  The Gateway Aggregation Response
   message also includes the number of tunnel information that the
   response-originator MBG has.

7.6.  Tunnel Establishment between MBGs

   After exchanging Gateway Aggregation Request/Response messages, each
   of the corresponding Anchor MBGs create an IP-in-IP tunnel through
   the interface that is connected to their ARs.  After the tunnel is
   established, the logical inner-tunnel interface is attached to the
   MANET interface list, and MANET control messages are transmitted
   through this tunnel.  At the same time as this, one of these two
   Anchor MBGs which has less tunnels compared to the other stops
   advertising the default route to the MANET and becomes normal MBG.
   If these two Anchor MBGs have the same number of tunnels, then the
   MBG which generated the Gateway Aggregation Response message stops
   advertising the default route to the MANET.  The ultimate result is
   that there will exist only one Anchor MBG that advertises the default
   route in the MANET.

7.7.  Data Packet Forwarding

   Data packets are forwarded as determined by the MANET routing
   protocol.  The nearest MBG is selected by the MANET routing protocol
   when the data packet to the Internet needs to be forwarded.  The
   nearest MBG MAY forward the data packet to its AR, or MAY forward it
   to the Anchor MBG through the tunnel according to the MANET routing
   policy.

7.8.  Gateway Reconfiguration message generation

   This message is generated only when the tunnels need to be
   reconfigured.  This message should be generated in the following
   cases:

      Two or more MANETs each having Anchor MBG and multiple MBG are
      merged.

      Tunnel breakage is detected.

   When a MBG receives this message, the MBG SHOULD send a Gateway
   Aggregate Request message to the originator of the message to
   reconfigure the tunnel between its originator and itself.  If a
   candidate address is included in this message, the MBG SHOULD send a
   Gateway Aggregation Request message to the candidate address.
