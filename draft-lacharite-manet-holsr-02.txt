Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


Abstract

   This document describes the Hierarchical Optimized Link State Routing
   (HOLSR) mechanism for heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks.  In this
   specification a heterogeneous mobile ad hoc network is defined as a
   network of mobile routers that are characterized by different
   communication capabilities, such as communication channels,
   processing powers or energy levels.

   The HOLSR mechanism is an extension to the OLSRv2 protocol.  HOLSR
   takes advantage of the router's distinct communications capabilities
   to reduce the routing control overhead in large heterogeneous ad hoc
   networks, thus improving the performance of the routing mechanism.
   More precisely, HOLSR defines a hierarchy in the network and presents
   a routing scheme for this hierarchical structure with a better
   scalability.

Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Hierarchical Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (HOLSR) is
   designed for heterogeneous ad hoc networks, and is an extension to
   the OLSRv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2] routing protocol.  HOLSR has two
   main functionalities:

   o  Hierarchy building: HOLSR organizes routers into hierarchical
      levels according to their capacities (e.g. radio, energy,
      processing) and dynamically groups routers into clusters at each
      level.

   o  Hierarchical routing: HOLSR provides a hierarchical routing that
      supports random movement of the routers among and between
      clusters, and can dynamically adapt to topology changes at
      different levels.  Within each cluster, the OLSRv2 routing
      protocol, as specified in [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2], is used.

   The main improvements realized by the HOLSR protocol are a reduction
   in the amount of topology control information that needs to be
   exchanged at different levels of the hierarchical network topology,
   and the efficient use of high capacity routers.  Another significant
   benefit is a reduction in routing computational cost: if a link in
   one part of the network is broken, only those routers within the
   cluster in which the link exists need to re-calculate the routing
   table, while routers in other clusters are not affected.  HOLSR is
   versatile in that it does not require a logical hierarchical
   addressing scheme but can accommodate one if required.

   In an HOLSR network structure, the routers equipped with high
   capacity links form the higher-level network, while the routers with
   low capacity links form the lower-level network.  At a given level,
   cluster heads are selected from the routers with higher capabilities.
   The choice of the cluster head or the establishment of its capability
   criteria (e.g. multiple interfaces, more processing power, increased
   memory, etc.), is out of scope of this document.  It is left to the
   implementer or the administrator, who can select the best criteria
   adapted to the specific network deployment.  Routers can move from
   one cluster to another, and can associate with the nearest cluster
   head, while the cluster heads propagate updated membership
   information among each other using Hierarchical Topology Control
   (HTC) messages.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses OLSR terminology as defined in OLSRv1 [RFC3626]
   and OLSRv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2].  MANET specific terminology is to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC5444] and NHDP
   [I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp].

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology:

   Cluster
      A small group or gathering of MANET routers that have the same
      cluster head.

   Cluster Head
      A MANET router can become a cluster head at level i if:

      *  it possesses a "higher capability" besides the one it shares
         with its cluster neighbor routers, and

      *  it participates in communication level i+1.

      The definition of "higher capability" is a deployment issue, out
      of scope of this document.

   Cluster Member
      A MANET router that is associated with a cluster head.

   CIA
      Cluster Id Announcement.  A control message initiated periodically
      by a cluster head to declare its leadership and invite other
      routers to join its cluster.  Cluster members generate CIA
      messages including a distance field set to their distance (in
      terms of number of hops) to the cluster head).  The message is
      generated by cluster members until it reaches the edge of the
      cluster.

   Cluster Edge
      Cluster Edge.  Distinguishes routers belonging to the cluster from
      others.

   Cluster Intersection Depth
      When routers from one cluster can hear Cluster Id Announcements
      from another cluster, it is said that these two clusters
      intersect, i.e. a router on the edge of one cluster is in radio
      communication range from the edge of a neighbor cluster.  The
      depth of the intersection depends on the permissions given to edge
      routers from different clusters to inter-communicate without going

      through (and bypassing) their respective cluster heads.  For a
      depth value of '1', edge routers from two different clusters
      within radio range can communicate, but they cannot forward
      messages from each other within their own cluster.  For a depth
      value of '2', the same two edge routers are permitted to forward
      neighbor cluster's messages once (Time to live (TTL) = '1').  For
      a depth value of '3', TTL = '2', etc.

   HTC
      Hierarchical Topology Control (TC).  A control message sent
      periodically that is used to propagate the membership information
      of a cluster to the higher hierarchical level routers.

   OLSRv2
      The Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2 is an update
      to OLSRv1 as published in [RFC3626].

   Router
      A MANET router which implements the Hierarchical OLSRv2 protocol
      as specified in this document.

   Topology level
      A logical level that is composed of links and routers that share
      similar characteristics (e.g. bandwidth, transmission range,
      energy capacity, processing capacity).  The higher the level gets,
      the "better" the characteristics are.


3.  Applicability Statement

   Many contemporary ad hoc wireless networks are heterogeneous in
   nature, being comprised of mobile devices with heterogeneous
   capacities.  For instance, these devices can have distinct
   communications capabilities with respect to data rate, radio range,
   frequency band, etc.  They can also have different energy capacities
   and different processing capacities.  We can cite two examples of
   networks where HOLSR provides high benefits: military networks and
   sensor networks.

   In military networks for instance, soldiers, tanks and headquarters
   might each be given wireless communication equipment that is
   appropriate to their communication needs.  Soldiers are usually
   equipped with wireless communication devices characterized by limited
   resources in terms of radio bandwidth, energy capacity and processing
   capacity.  Those devices can only handle limited transmission range
   and have restricted communications bandwidth.  Vehicles, on the other
   hand, are outfitted with more powerful equipments providing extended
   communication coverage with higher communication bandwidth

   capability.

   In data gathering applications supported by wireless sensor networks,
   the aim is to maximize network lifetime.  Energy efficient strategies
   are used such as clustering.  Cluster heads are selected among the
   routers with a sufficient energy level, and rotate in order to
   balance energy consumption.  Cluster heads can also be chosen with an
   additional applicative criterion: they represent routers having the
   same data value to transmit to the data sink.

   HOLSR is also beneficial to mesh networks in general, where there can
   be limited or no mobility such as sensor networks.  HOLSR can manage
   a combination of mobile and non-mobile components.

   Scalability is one of the most important factors governing the
   efficiencies of heterogeneous wireless networks.  Scalability may be
   defined as the ability of a network to adjust or maintain its
   performance when its size increases.  That also includes the increase
   in traffic load that is handled.  Yet under a "flat" routing
   protocol, the performance of an ad hoc network tends to degrade as
   the number of mobile routers increases.  When a flat routing protocol
   is used, the resulting control overhead increases, depending on the
   number of interfaces possessed by each router since more links need
   to be propagated for each router in order to share the topology
   information.  Concerning data gathering applications, the use of
   hierarchical routing enables reducing the amount of data transferred
   to the sink, and hence to maximize network lifetime.


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   HOLSR consists of 2 main functionalities: enabling the creation of a
   hierarchy structure on top of a standard OLSR network; and providing
   the control messaging tools to transmit the hierarchy topology and
   enable routing through the use of gateway routers, defined as cluster
   heads.

   The criteria used to define and select cluster heads unto which to
   construct the HOLSR hierarchical structure is outside the scope of
   this protocol.

4.1.  Hierarchy Building

   In HOLSR, a hierarchical structure is constructed over the network
   based on its member routers' capabilities.  In the following
   description, the criteria selected for higher capabilities is linked
   to the amount and properties of each router's wireless interfaces.

   Let us demonstrate the idea using figures 1 and 2, composed of 23
   MANET routers.  In figure 1, routers are denoted by letters, and
   their preceding character determines their capabilities and available
   interfaces.  Thus a "." identifies regular MANET routers, a "#"
   identifies routers with 2 interfaces ("low" and "medium" range
   radio); a "&" identifies routers with 3 interfaces (low, medium, and
   "long" range radio); and a "@" identifies routers with 2 interfaces
   (medium and long range radios).

   For this example, it is decided that the routers with multiple
   interfaces be used as cluster heads.  From then on, MANET routers
   start organizing themselves into clusters around their cluster heads.
   There are 4 cluster heads (a, f, p, and t) that have dual low and
   medium transmission range interfaces.  These form 4 intersecting
   clusters at level 1 (see figure 2).  Routers are identified with
   their cluster id (capital character followed by a number, or 'H' for
   a cluster head), cluster A members are now AH, A1, A2, and A3
   (respectively a, b, c and d), etc.  Clusters at level 2 are formed by
   routers that possess at least one interface with medium transmission
   range.  This requirement is matched by routers a, f, p, r, and u.
   From these routers, the ones that contain an additional long
   transmission range radio interface (level 3) become cluster heads at
   level 2 (this applies to routers f and r).  Hence 2 clusters are
   created at level 2 (E and F with cluster heads EH and FH).  The level
   3 "overall" cluster is formed by routers f and r, since they share
   the long transmission range capabilities.  No cluster head is
   required at level 3 since 1) there is no higher level; 2) the 2
   members are in transmission range of each other.

   Cluster formation of the hierarchy structure is made possible by the
   addition of Cluster Id Announcement (CIA) messages.  Every router
   selected as a cluster head sends CIA messages periodically to declare
   its leadership and invite other routers to join its cluster.
   Section 6 provides complete details.

4.2.  Hierarchy Routing

   In HOLSR, at a given level, routers can move from one cluster to
   another and associate with the nearest cluster head.  For routing
   purposes, the information about cluster membership is transmitted to
   higher levels by the cluster heads.  The following denotes the
   routing structure within HOLSR:

   o  Within each cluster, OLSRv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2] runs
      unaltered, providing routing topology information about router
      destinations within the same cluster.  TC message propagation is
      limited within the local cluster.

   o  Between clusters, the information about cluster membership and
      topology information is transmitted to higher levels by the
      cluster heads using Hierarchical Topology Control (HTC) messages.

   o  For routers located in overlapping regions of multiple clusters,
      OLSRv2 TC messages can (with restrictions) be propagated not only
      within the cluster but to the neighbor clusters as well.  This
      feature is controlled by the C_INTER_DEPTH parameter defined in
      Section 5.3.  Section 6.7.3provides complete details.

   o  Traffic from one cluster with destination to another cluster will
      travel up the levels through cluster heads (acting as gateways)
      and then down to reach their destination.  Routers set their
      cluster head as default gateway in their routing table.  Hence,
      every traffic request for destinations outside of their cluster
      will go through their cluster head.


5.  Protocol Parameters

   The parameters used in this specification are those defined in OLSRv2
   [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2] plus those described in this section.

5.1.  Message Intervals

   The following parameters regulate CIA and HTC message transmissions
   by a router.

5.1.1.  CIA Messages

   CIA messages are transmitted periodically to advertise a router's
   cluster head id and its distance from that cluster head.  The
   frequency of these advertisements is regulated by the parameters
   CIA_INTERVAL and CIA_MIN_INTERVAL.

   Specifically, these parameters are as follows:

   CIA_INTERVAL
      the maximum time between the transmission of two successive CIA
      messages by a given cluster head.  If using periodic transmission
      of CIA messages for a given cluster head, these SHOULD be at a
      separation of CIA_INTERVAL, and MAY be modified by jitter as
      specified in [RFC5148].

   CIA_MIN_INTERVAL
      the minimum interval between transmission of two successive CIA
      messages by a given cluster head.  (This minimum interval MAY be
      modified by jitter, as defined in [RFC5148].)

   The following constraints apply to these parameters:

   o  CIA_INTERVAL > 0

   o  CIA_MIN_INTERVAL >= 0

   o  CIA_INTERVAL >= CIA_MIN_INTERVAL

   o  If INTERVAL_TIME message TLVs as defined in [RFC5497] are included
      in CIA messages, then CIA_INTERVAL MUST be representable as
      described in [RFC5497].

5.1.2.  HTC Messages

   HTC messages are transmitted periodically by a cluster head to
   advertise its membership information to routers at the higher
   hierarchical level.  The frequency of these advertisements is
   regulated by the parameters HTC_INTERVAL and HTC_MIN_INTERVAL.  HTC
   messages are an extension to the TC messages from OLSRv2
   [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2], and as such they MAY use the same message
   interval parameters, and the same message validity times:

   HTC_INTERVAL
      the maximum time between the transmission of two successive HTC
      messages by a cluster head.  When no HTC messages are sent in
      response to local network changes under the cluster head, then HTC
      messages SHOULD be sent at a regular interval HTC_INTERVAL,

      possibly modified by jitter as specified in [RFC5148].

   HTC_MIN_INTERVAL
      the minimum interval between transmission of two successive HTC
      messages by a cluster head.  (This minimum interval MAY be
      modified by jitter, as defined in [RFC5148].)

   The following constraints apply to these parameters:

   o  HTC_INTERVAL > 0

   o  HTC_MIN_INTERVAL >= 0

   o  HTC_INTERVAL >= HTC_MIN_INTERVAL

   o  If INTERVAL_TIME message TLVs as defined in [RFC5497] are included
      in HTC messages, then HTC_INTERVAL MUST be representable as
      described in [RFC5497].

5.2.  Information Validity Times

5.2.1.  CIA Validity Times

   The following parameters manage the validity time of CIA information:

   CIA_HOLD_TIME
      the value in the VALIDITY_TIME message TLV included in the CIA
      message.

   The following constraints apply to this parameter:

   o  CIA_HOLD_TIME >= CIA_INTERVAL

   o  CIA_HOLD_TIME MUST be representable as described in [RFC5497].

5.2.2.  HTC Validity Times

   HOLSR HTC messages SHOULD use the same validity time parameters as
   for TC messages in OLSRv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2].

   OLSRv2 TC parameters for validity times are (refer to OLSRv2
   [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2] for definitions):

   o  T_HOLD_TIME

   o  A_HOLD_TIME

   o  RX_HOLD_TIME

   o  P_HOLD_TIME

   o  F_HOLD_TIME

5.3.  Cluster Intersection Depth

   The following parameter regulates the communication between clusters
   that are intersecting.  This parameter has a direct impact on the
   decision to route traffic through cluster heads are directly between
   clusters at the same level.

   C_INTER_DEPTH
      the maximum depth that routers from different clusters in an
      intersected area can include routers from another cluster than
      their own in their routing tables (routers can only select one
      cluster head ID).

   The following constraints apply to this parameter:

   C_INTER_DEPTH >= 0

5.4.  Cluster Critical Path

   The following parameter is used to identify cluster heads located on
   critical paths on the HOLSR architecture.  A router is considered to
   be on a critical path if its failure causes network partition.

   C_CRITICAL_PATH
      - identifies a cluster head as being on the critical path of the
      hierarchical structure.

   The following constraints apply to this parameter:

   C_CRITICAL_PATH = [0,1], where 0 is 'false', and 1 is 'true'

6.1.  Description of HOLSR Logical Topology Levels

   Based on different communication capacities, routers are organized
   into logical topology levels.  A logical topology level is
   constituted by routers having similar capacities (e.g. radio
   bandwidth, radio interface, energy capacity, processing capacity).
   The grouping and ordering of routers with similar capacities (to
   determine which to assign to higher or lower layers) is an
   administrator and deployment issue.  Since one router can have
   multiple communication capacities (by possessing different wireless
   interfaces, for example), it can be visible as a router in different
   logical topology levels.  Usually, low-power routers are equipped
   with only one interface offering limited data rate and transmission
   range.  Such routers participate at the lowest topology Level 1.

   Routers at topology level i+1, with i greater than or equal to 1,
   have higher capacities than routers at level i.  Any router at level
   i must be able to communicate, via a multi-hop path if necessary,
   with a router at level i that is able to communicate with a router at
   level i+1.  In the same manner, if the level i+2 exists, then any
   router at level i+1 must be able to communicate with a router at
   level i+1 that is able to communicate with a router at level i+2.

6.1.1.  Example

   An example of a three levels hierarchy can be described as follows.
   Routers at topology level 2 are equipped with a wireless interface
   that can provide a higher data rate and longer transmission range
   than the interfaces present on the level 1 routers.  Some of the
   routers in topology level 2 possess up to two wireless interfaces,
   one of which is a wireless interface capable of communicating with
   level 1 routers.  These routers can relay messages at topology level
   2 using a frequency band or a medium access control (MAC) protocol
   that can differ from the one used for communication at topology level
   1.

   Topology level 3 routers represent routers with the highest capacity.
   These routers can be equipped with up to three wireless interfaces
   capable of communicating in turn with level 1 and 2 routers and with
   other level 3 routers via high-speed point-to-point direct wireless
   links.  It should be noted that routers in level 3 or 2 can have
   fewer than three or two wireless interfaces, respectively, and the



Lacharite, et al.       Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


   only requirement is that level 3 or 2 routers should be equipped with
   at least one wireless interface for communications at level 3 or 2,
   respectively.  For example, a level 3 router could possess only one
   high-speed point-to-point interface for ensuring communication with
   level 3 routers.

   The rules governing these first three levels can be scaled to
   additional topology levels, as the HOLSR network increases in size.

6.2.  Cluster Formation

   Under the HOLSR mechanism, in each logical topology level, (the last
   one possibly excepted), the mobile routers form multiple clusters
   upon cluster heads' invitation, which in turn can be organized into a
   hierarchical architecture.  Unlike (flat) OLSRv2, HOLSR routers can
   restrict exchange of Topology Control (TC) messages within clusters,
   thus reducing the amount of control information that is broadcast
   throughout the entire network.  The topology control information
   between clusters is exchanged via specialized HOLSR routers
   designated as cluster heads.

   The HOLSR cluster heads are selected among those higher-capacity
   routers.  However, the choice of the cluster head is not ruled by
   HOLSR, it is left to the administrator of the network.  Similarly,
   the level at which a router exists or can exist is determined and
   assigned administratively, and according to specific network
   deployment requirements.

   Mobile routers can be organized into clusters at different topology
   levels.  A cluster comprises a group of mobile routers (at the same
   topology level) that are associated with a common cluster head.

   At each level, the multiple mobile routers that have been selected as
   cluster heads declare their status and thereby invite other routers
   to join their cluster by periodically sending out Cluster ID
   Announcement (CIA) messages.  CIA messages contain two fields:
   cluster head, which identifies the interface address of the cluster
   head generating the CIA message, and distance (in hops) to that
   cluster head.  CIA messages are sent with Time to live (TTL) = '1',
   i.e. they only travel one hop.  When a cluster head generates a CIA
   message, it identifies itself within the cluster head field, with
   distance being 0.

   After reception of a CIA message, the routers in proximity to the
   cluster head will join that cluster, given that these routers are not
   part of any cluster, or that the distance to this advertized cluster
   head is less than the distance to another cluster head they might
   already be associated with.



Lacharite, et al.       Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


   Once a router joins a cluster, it begins to broadcast CIA messages,
   where the cluster head field contains the ID of the cluster head it
   is associated with, and the distance field containing the distance,
   in hops, from that router to the cluster head.

   In a nutshell, every router within a cluster, once associated with a
   cluster head, generates CIA messages with ID field set to cluster
   head ID, the distance field set to the distance from the router and
   its cluster head (in hops), and a TTL value of '1'.

6.2.1.  Particular Case: Cluster Intersections

   A given router may receive CIA messages from different cluster heads,
   indicating that it is located in the overlapping regions of multiple
   clusters.  In such cases, the router joins whichever cluster is
   closer in terms of hop count and generates CIA messages only with the
   ID of the cluster head chosen.

   There may also be scenarios where multiple routers with the same
   capabilities are located in the vicinity of each other.  In this
   situation, a lower-level router may receive CIA messages with the
   same hop count from various cluster heads.  The router will on this
   case attach itself to the cluster head from which it receives the
   first CIA and remain with that cluster head for as long as the
   topology does not change.  It should be noted that given the random
   movement of mobile routers, a router might find a cluster head closer
   that the one to which it is currently attached.  In this case, the
   mobile router will proceed to change its cluster and attach itself to
   the closest cluster head.  Following this process, each router in the
   lowest level joins a selected cluster, and the mechanism is in turn
   applied at the different topology levels.

6.2.2.  Cluster ID Announcement Validity Timer

   A built-in diagnostic feature helps ensure the robustness of the
   HOLSR clustering mechanism: each router registers a timeout value for
   the CIA messages received.  Should a cluster head become inactive or
   move away, routers in its cluster will stop receiving the CIA
   messages.  Eventually the CIA message timeout value will expire and
   cached CIA information will become invalid.  At this point the mobile
   routers will start to process CIA messages from another cluster and
   join that cluster, should an opportunity present itself.  If no more
   CIA messages are received, then the routers will behave following the
   OLSRv2 specifications.

6.3.  Cluster Interaction

   One of the main challenges in the HOLSR hierarchical architecture is
   support for exchange of topology information between clusters at the
   same or different topology levels without introducing too much
   overhead.  In HOLSR, a cluster head acts as a gateway through which
   messages from cluster members are relayed to other parts of the
   network.  Under the HOLSR network architecture each cluster head at
   level i needs to advertise the membership information of routers
   under its hierarchy to level i+1.  This is done with the use of the
   Hierarchical TC message.

6.3.1.  Types of Hierarchical Topology Control Message

   A Hierarchical Topology Control (HTC) message is generated by a
   cluster head and used to transmit the membership information of a
   cluster (under this cluster head) to the higher hierarchical level
   routers.  Three basic types of HTC messages are used:

   Full membership
      Full membership messages are periodically transmitted by a cluster
      head to provide information about its cluster members, including
      members of any lower-level clusters beneath it.

   Update
      Update HTC messages provide information with respect to cluster
      membership changes (i.e., the update HTC messages are used when
      mobile routers join or leave a cluster).

   Request
      As HTC messages carry a sequence number field, it is possible to
      determine whether any HTC packet loss has occurred, in which case
      a request for retransmission of a full membership HTC message is
      sent by the receiving router.

   In topological terms, the higher a given router is located, the more
   information it obtains about the network.  Routers at the highest
   topology level possess full knowledge of all the routers in the
   network; consequently, the sizes of their routing tables are as large
   as they would be under OLSRv2.  Routers at lowest topology level are
   limited in scope; and consequently the size of their routing tables
   are reduced.  I.e.  They set their cluster head as default gateway in
   their routing tables, and all traffic route requests for routers
   outside their cluster is routed through the cluster head; which is
   exactly the way it is intended to be.

Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


6.3.2.  HTC and TC Message Propagation

   Routers at each hierarchical level independently select MPRs in their
   respective cluster level.  HTC is generated by a cluster head at
   level i for the level i+1, if this level exists.  It is forwarded by
   MPRs at level i+1 within this single cluster.  At each hierarchical
   level, TC messages are generated independently.  The propagation of
   the TC is restricted within a cluster, unless a router is located in
   the overlapping regions of several clusters.  Therefore, an HOLSR
   router's location directly determines the required scope of its
   knowledge of network topology: for routers located toward the center
   of the cluster, TC propagation is limited to the local cluster; for
   routers located in overlapping regions of multiple clusters, the TC
   message is propagated not only within the local cluster but one hop
   further to the neighbor routers in other clusters as well.  This
   approach offers two main advantages:

   o  The control message reflecting local movement is restricted within
      the local area, which largely reduces protocol overhead as well as
      routing table computation overhead

   o  Nearby routers in different clusters at the same topology level
      can communicate directly without having to follow the strict
      clustering hierarchy, which decreases delay and reduces the load
      on the cluster head.

6.4.  Clusters Decommission

   To increase robustness of the HOLSR architecture and to avoid
   possible network partitions, cluster heads are permitted, in very
   specific cases, to abandon their "head" status.

   If a router that was initialized as a cluster head satisfies the
   requirements for decommissioning, it starts to emit CIA message
   announcements with the distance parameter (CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST) set to
   '255'.  Cluster members, with matching cluster head ID, receiving
   such a message will de-associate from that cluster head.  A router
   that is de-associated will then be able to process CIA messages from
   neighbor clusters.

   The requirements to decommission are (i) to have the parameter
   C_CRITICAL_PATH set to "true" on one level/interface, and (ii) to
   lose all connections/links on that interface.  It is up to the
   network administrator to determine what routers on what interfaces
   could cause network partition if failure occurs.

   A decommissioned cluster head will revive its "head" status when the
   interface with the C_CRITICAL_PATH set to "true" has at least one

   link successfully reinstated.  The cluster head will then publish CIA
   announcements with the distance parameter set to '0'.  As a result,
   routers closer to this cluster head will re-associate with it.

6.5.  HOLSR Repositories

   In addition to the repositories maintained by OLSRv2, HOLSR maintains
   the following repositories:

   o  A Cluster Information Base.
      It contains one entry describing the head of the cluster to which
      that routers belongs, its relative distance (in hop counts) to the
      cluster head, and an expiry time.  This repository is populated
      and updated upon receipt of a Cluster Identifier Announcement
      (CIA) message.  The repository entry is timestamped with the time
      of the last update +<expiry_time>.  When the repository entry
      expires (as consequence of not receiving any CIA message for an
      <expiry_time> period), the entry is deleted, and the router looses
      its association to its cluster head.  Particular cases:

      *  At the cluster head: Cluster ID is one-self, distance is '0',
         and expiry_time is 0 or ignored.

      *  At the cluster members: Cluster Head ID is cluster head,
         distance is ]0, 255[, and expiry_time is > 0.

   o  Hierarchical Topology Information Base (cluster membership).
      This repository is populated and updated upon receipt of
      Hierarchical Topology Control messages.  It contains one entry for
      each HTC message originator (cluster head) received.  Each entry
      is tupled with the list of member routers, the sequence number it
      was assigned by the cluster head, and the interface it was
      retrieved from.  Each repository entry is timestamped with the
      time of the last update +<expiry_time>.  Particular cases:

      *  At the cluster head: one of the HTC originator entry contains
         information about this cluster head router membership.  This
         entry is generated by the router without reception of an HTC
         message.

      *  At the cluster member routers that are not cluster heads
         themselves: none of the originator entries matches the router's
         own address.

6.6.  HOLSR Messages

   HOLSR uses the Generalized MANET Packet/Message Format as defined in
   [RFC5444], and adds 2 new message types and 4 new TLVs, as described
   below.

6.6.1.  CIA Messages

   At each level, the multiple mobile routers that have been defined to
   become cluster heads declare their status and invite other routers to
   join their cluster by periodically sending out Cluster ID
   Announcement (CIA) messages.  CIA messages MUST NOT be forwarded, as
   their expected recipients are the immediate neighbors of the emitting
   router(s).

   CIA messages MUST contain the following 2 TLV messages:

   o  CLUSTER_HEAD_ID message TLV identifying the interface address of
      the cluster head generating the CIA message

   o  CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST message TLV specifying the distance in hops to
      that cluster head.  There are 3 particular cases for
      CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST values;

      *  CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST = '0': Identifies and is generated by the
         cluster head.

      *  CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST is '255': Cluster decommission message
         generated by the cluster head first, and consequently by its
         member routers.

      *  CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST is > '0' and < '255': Generated by routers
         associating with the cluster head, and which are not themselves
         cluster heads.

   CIA messages MAY contain the following 2 TLV messages:

   o  VALIDITY_TIME message TLV as specified in [RFC5497], representing
      CIA_HOLD_TIME for the transmitting MANET interface.  The options
      included in time in [RFC5497], for representing zero and infinite
      time MUST NOT be used.

   o  INTERVAL_TIME message TLV as specified in [RFC5497], representing
      CIA_INTERVAL for the transmitting MANET interface.  The options
      included in time in [RFC5497], for representing zero and infinite
      time MUST NOT be used.

6.6.1.1.  CIA Message TLVs

   In a CIA message, a router must include a single CLUSTER_HEAD_ID
   message TLV and a single CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST, as specified in Table 1.

   +-------------------+--------+--------------------------------------+
   |        Type       |  Value | Value                                |
   |                   | Length |                                      |
   +-------------------+--------+--------------------------------------+
   |  CLUSTER_HEAD_ID  |    1   | Specifies the cluster head ID        |
   |                   |  octet | selected by this router (generator   |
   |                   |        | of the CIA message)                  |
   | CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST |    1   | Specifies the distance, in hops,     |
   |                   |  octet | between the cluster head and this    |
   |                   |        | router (generator of the CIA         |
   |                   |        | message)                             |
   +-------------------+--------+--------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

6.6.2.  HTC Messages

   A Hierarchical TC (HTC) message is used to transmit membership
   information of a cluster to higher hierarchical level routers.

   There are 3 basic types of HTC messages:

   o  FULL_MEMBERSHIP
      Full membership HTC messages are periodically transmitted by a
      cluster head to provide information about its cluster members,
      including members of any lower-level clusters beneath it.

   o  UPDATE
      Update HTC messages provide information with respect to cluster
      membership changes (i.e., the update HTC messages are used when
      mobile routers join or leave a cluster).  As HTC messages carry a
      sequence number field, it is possible to determine whether any HTC
      packet loss has occurred, in which case a request for
      retransmission of a full membership HTC message is sent by the
      receiving router.  HTC forwarding is enabled by MPRs, and is
      restricted within a cluster.

   o  REQUEST
      Request HTC messages are used to request retransmission of full
      membership HTC messages.

   An HTC message MUST contain an HTC message type TLV:

Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


   o  HTC_MSG_TYPE message TLV that is one of FULL_MEMBERSHIP, UPDATE or
      REQUEST.

   An HTC message of type FULL_MEMBERSHIP or UPDATE MUST contain a
   sequence number message TLV.  REQUEST type message do not need to
   include this TLV:

   o  HTC_SEQ_NUM message TLV, specified by an incrementing counter on
      the HTC message generation at the cluster head router.

   TLV messages used within the HTC messages:

6.7.  HOLSR Algorithm

6.7.1.  Processing and Broadcasting CIA Message

   A CIA message is periodically generated and sent by a router that has
   been configured as cluster head.  A CIA message generated from a
   cluster head has its distance value set to 0.

   Routers that join the cluster identified by the cluster head also
   generate CIA messages periodically.  CIA message generated from these
   routers are sent with their distance value equal to the hop count
   between themselves and the cluster head.

   When a router receives a CIA message, three cases are possible:

   o  the router does not yet belong to a cluster: it joins the cluster
      by (i) populating its cluster head repository and (ii) starting to
      broadcast CIA messages, inviting other routers to join this
      cluster.  The cluster head distance value stored in its repository
      is the value received from the CIA message processed plus one.




Lacharite, et al.       Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                    HOLSR                        July 2009


   o  the router already belongs to a cluster: it checks if its distance
      to the cluster head indicated in the received CIA message is
      smaller than its distance to its current cluster head.  If yes, it
      joins the new cluster, updates its cluster head repository and
      starts broadcasting CIA messages with the newly selected cluster
      ID (and distance set accordingly).  Otherwise, it continues to
      broadcast CIA messages with the distance and cluster ID values
      from its repository.

   o  the router receives a decommission message (CLUSTER_HEAD_DIST =
      255).  If the router's cluster head matches the cluster's ID from
      the CIA message, it will de-associate from that cluster head.  The
      router will forward that decommission message until it associates
      itself with another cluster head.

6.7.2.  Processing and Forwarding HTC Message

   Cluster heads generate different types of HTC messages.  For all
   message types, only one sequence number is stored.  Every time an HTC
   message is generated, the sequence number is incremented and included
   in that message (regardless of its type).

   Cluster heads generate HTC messages of type FULL_MEMBERSHIP and
   UPDATE.

   Cluster members generate HTC messages of type REQUEST.

   Concerning HTC messages, we distinguish:

   o  a HTC message with full membership that is periodically generated
      and sent by a cluster head of level i to the level i+1.  This
      message contains a sequence number that is incremented, as well as
      the list of routers in the cluster membership (hierarchical
      topology information base) repository.

   o  an update HTC message is generated by a cluster head of level i to
      notify cluster membership changes to level i+1.  This message
      contains a sequence number that is incremented, as well as the new
      routers having joined the cluster and the old routers having left.
      It is computed from the cluster membership repository, after
      addition or removal of a member router entry.

   o  a request HTC message is generated by a router that has received a
      HTC message with a sequence number higher than its last one plus
      one.  This router asks for transmission of a full membership
      message.

   Upon receipt of a full membership HTC message, a router checks the

   received sequence number:

   o  if it is smaller or equal, the message is silently discarded.

   o  otherwise, the received membership information replaces the old
      one in the cluster membership repository.  The message is
      forwarded according to the OLSRv2 forwarding rule.

   Upon receipt of an update HTC message, a router checks the received
   sequence number:

   o  if it is smaller or equal, the message is silently discarded.

   o  if it is greater by 1 than the sequence number maintained in the
      repository, the received membership information is used to update
      the information in the cluster membership repository.  The message
      is forwarded according to OLSRv2 forwarding rule.

   o  otherwise, if it is greater by more than 1, a request HTC message
      is generated and sent to get the missing HTC messages.

   Upon receipt of a request HTC message, a router checks if it is the
   originator of the HTC message for which a request is made (usually
   the originator router is a cluster head):

   o  if yes, it sends a full membership message back to the sender.

   o  otherwise, this message is forwarded according to OLSR forwarding
      rule.

6.7.3.  Cluster Intersection Handling

   Routers located within the intersecting domain of 2 or more clusters
   are allowed to communicate directly (by-passing their respective
   cluster heads) by setting the C_INTER_DEPTH parameter to a value
   greater than 0.

   In the intersection domain, routers SHOULD process all HELLO and TC
   messages, even those not pertaining to their own cluster Id.  The use
   of a neighbor cluster's HELLO and TC message information to build up
   the routing tables is constrained by the C_INTER_DEPTH parameter.

   If C_INTER_DEPTH is greater than 1, an MPR in the intersecting domain
   is allowed to forward a TC message originating from a router not
   pertaining to its own cluster.

   Figure 3 - Intersecting Clusters Example

   Clusters A and B intersect because routers in the intersection area
   (A6, A7, B7) are able to hear CIA announcements from 2 different
   cluster heads (AH and BH).

   If C_INTER_DEPTH is set to 1, then the direct communication between
   A6 <--> B7, and A7 <--> B7 is enabled.  If routers A7 wants to
   communicate with router B3, it will have to do so going through its
   cluster head AH (A7 -> A3 -> AH -> BH -> B3).

   If C_INTER_DEPTH is set to 2, then router A7 is allowed to
   communicate directly with router B3 (bypassing its cluster head) by
   using the path provided by router B7; Hence A7 -> B7 -> B3.


7.  Proposed Values for Parameters

   This section lists the parameters and their default proposed values
   used in the specification of the protocol.

7.1.  Message Intervals Parameter Defaults

7.1.1.  CIA Messages

   By default these parameters are set to be identical to those used
   within NHDP [I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp] for HELLO messages and intervals.

   o  CIA INTERVAL = 2 seconds

   o  CIA_MIN_INTERVAL = CIA_INTERVAL/4 = 0.5 seconds

7.1.2.  HTC Messages

   By default these parameters are set to be identical to those used
   within OLSRv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2] for TC messages and intervals.

   o  HTC_INTERVAL = 5 seconds

   o  HTC_MIN_INTERVAL = HTC_INTERVAL/4 = 1.25 seconds

7.2.  Information Validity Times Parameters

7.2.1.  CIA Messages

   o  CIA_HOLD_TIME = 3 x CIA_INTERVAL

7.2.2.  HTC Messages

   Since HTC validity times parameter refer to TC parameters, their
   default parameters SHOULD use the same values at the ones used in
   OLSRv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2].

   o  T_HOLD_TIME = 3 x TC_INTERVAL

   o  A_HOLD_TIME = T_HOLD_TIME

   o  RX_HOLD_TIME = 30 seconds

   o  P_HOLD_TIME = 30 seconds

   o  F_HOLD_TIME = 30 seconds

7.3.  Cluster Intersection Depth

   o  C_INTER_DEPTH = 1

7.4.  Cluster Critical Path

   o  C_CRITICAL_PATH = 0 (false)

10.2.  TLV Types

   This specification defines four message TLV types, which must be
   allocated from the "Message TLV Types" namespace defined in
   [RFC5444].  IANA are requested to make allocations in the 8-127 range

   Figure 4 - Data Transfer using Hierarchical Structure

   Routing information is updated by all the routers in a given cluster.
   Thus, communication between routers in a cluster is achieved via the
   routing information in the routing tables.  For data transmissions
   outside the cluster, the cluster heads are used as gateways.  To
   describe the communication between clusters, lets look at an example
   network with 3 levels.

   First, lets specify the terminology of the example.  Routers are
   represented by a "." followed by a lowercase letter.  Figure 4
   contains 23 routers labeled from ".a" to ".w".  Prefixed to the
   router id is a capital character followed by a number, or an H. It
   defines the cluster membership of a router and its cluster head
   status.  In the case where a router is involved in many clusters, on
   many levels (because it contains multiple interfaces), the capital

   letter references the cluster membership from the lowest level.  For
   example "AH.a" denotes router "a" which is the cluster head "H" of
   cluster "A".  Similarly, "D3.t" denotes router "t", the 3rd router
   member of cluster D, and not a cluster head.  On level 2, "C.p" is
   member of cluster F, but it is also the same router as level 1 "CH.p"
   which is the cluster head of cluster C. A bit more complex, router
   "BH.f" is the cluster head of cluster B at level 1, it is the same
   router as "EH.f" which is a cluster head of cluster E at level 2, and
   it is also the same router as "E.f" which is a member of the overall
   cluster at level 3.  Hence for the purpose of our example, router .f
   has 3 interfaces each one participating at a different level of the
   hierarchy.  Additionally, in the text description we denote levels
   with the prefix <l#->, e.g. <l1-> applies to level 1.

   Now, the example: Starting from the base topology level 1, when a
   router .b (l1-A1.b) of cluster A wants to transmit data to router .t
   (l1-D3.t) from another cluster D; it will route through the hierarchy
   levels instead of communicating directly at level 1.  Here is the
   actual path taken by the data.  Router l1-A1.b first sends its
   traffic to its cluster head router AH.a (l1-AH.a) -- On the next
   topology level 2, cluster head l1-AH.a corresponds to l2-A.a and is a
   member of Cluster E -- Router l2-A.a transmits in turn to its cluster
   head router l2-EH.f -- which corresponds to l3-E.f on level 3 --
   Router l3-E.f transmits to its neighbor l3-F.r -- equivalent to l2-
   FH.r on level 2 -- l2-FH.r forwards to l2-D.u -- cluster head of
   level one l1-DH.u -- Finally l1-DH.u transmits data to its
   destination l1-D3.t.  In summary, the data path can be represented
   by: l1-D3.t --> l1-AH.a == l2-A.a --> l2-EH.f == l3-E.f --> l3-F.r ==
   l2-FH.r --> l2-D.u == l1-DH.u --> l1-D3.t.  Or, abstracting the
   level/cluster information, traffic traversed 5 hops: .t --> .a --> .f
   --> .r --> .u --> .t.

   As we trace the path traveled by the data packets, we see that the
   cluster head is always used as the gateway by its member routers at
   lower hierarchical levels, for destinations outside the cluster.  The
   rules governing the three levels network can be scaled to a network
   with additional topology levels.

   Normally, data transmission between clusters follows clustering
   hierarchy described above.  However, a different transmission path is
   used when transmitting data between neighboring routers that belong
   to different clusters at the same topology level; in this situation,
   the cluster head is not used as a gateway to relay the information to
   the destination router in a different cluster.  Instead, data is sent
   to the neighbor router directly since TC messages are propagated one
   hop further on cluster edges to neighbor routers in other clusters.
   The depth of the routing infiltration at the edge of clusters is
   configurable via the C_INTER_DEPTH parameter.  With this strategy the

   As shown Figure 6, de-associated routers end up joining cluster C,
   which now contains all routers from previous clusters A, B, and E.
   Routers .a and .f still are still linked via their second interface
   (higher capabability), but their multiple interfaces are now handled
   by OLSRv2 (no more HTC messaging required from routers .a and .f
   since they are no longer cluster heads).

   Note.  From this example, it can also be shown that routers .f and .r

   Doing so, if the link in-between these 2 routers fails, all the
   network cluster heads would be decommission.  It it the
   responsibility of the network administrator to ensure that the

Appendix C.  Packet and Message Layout

   This appendix illustrates the translation from the abstract
   descriptions of packets employed in the protocol specification, and
   the bit-layout packets actually exchanged between MANET routers.

C.1.  Packet and Message Options

   The basic layout of an HOLSR packet, message body, address block, TLV
   block, and TLV is as described in [RFC5444], allowing all options.

C.2.  Example CIA Message

   An example CIA message, using IPv4 (four octet) addresses is as
   follows.  The overall message length is 37 octets.

   The message has the mhasorig, mhashoplimit, mhashopcount, and
   mhasseqnum flags of its four-bit flags field set (value 15), and
   hence includes an Originator Address, a Hop Limit, a Hop Count, and a
   Message Sequence Number (which is type independent).  Its four-bit
   message Address Length field has value 3, indicating that the message
   uses IPv4 address.  Thus, the overall message flags octet is of value
   243.  The message has a Message TLV block with content length 16
   octets, containing four message TLVs.  These TLVs represent message
   validity time, message interval time, CIA Cluster Head Id, and CIA
   Cluster Head Distance.  Each message TLV has the thasvalue flag of
   its flag octet set (value 16), and hence contains a Value field, with
   preceding Value Length 1 octet.

   The message has one Address Block.  It contains the interface address
   of the cluster head.  The first octet indicates that it contains one
   address.  The flags octet has the ahashead flag set indicating it has
   a head.  Its head length is 4, this is equal to the address length,
   it thus has no mid section.  This Address Block has no TLVs (TLV
   block content length is 0 octets).

C.3.  Example HTC Message

   An example HTC message, using IPv4 (four octet) addresses, is as
   follows.  The overall message length is 48 octets.

   The message has the mhasorig, mhashoplimit, mhashopcount, and
   mhasseqnum flags of its four-bit flags field set (value 15), and
   hence includes an Originator Address, a Hop Limit, a Hop Count, and a
   Message Sequence Number (which is type independent).  Its four-bit
   message Address Length field has value 3, indicating that the message
   uses IPv4 address.  Thus, the overall message flags octet is of value
   243.  The message has a Message TLV block with content length 17
   octets containing four TLVs.  The first two TLVs are validity and
   interval times as for the CIA message above.  The third TLV is the
   HTC message type.  The fourth TLV is the HTC sequence number TLV used
   to carry the 2 octet HTC_SEQ_NUM.  Each message TLV has the thasvalue
   flag of its flag octet set (value 16), and hence contains a Value
   field.  First three TLVs have a preceding Value Length 1 octet, and
   the last TLV has a preceding Value Length 2 octets.

   The message has one Address Block.  It contains 6 cluster members'
   addresses.  The first octet indicates that it contains 6 addresses.
   The flag octet has the ahashead flag set indicating it has a head.
   Its head length is 2 octets, hence mid sections length is two octets.
