        Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data Frames in CAPWAP
                 draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel-04

Abstract

   Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) defines a
   specification to encapsulate a station's data frames between the
   Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).
   Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either
   locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP data
   channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments encapsulating
   data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example to an Access
   Router (AR)) is desirable.  Further, it may also be desirable to use
   different tunnel encapsulations to carry the stations' data frames.
   This document provides a specification for this and refers to it as
   Alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The Alternate tunnel encapsulation
   allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint
   different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many
   known encapsulation types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may
   advertise support for Alternate tunnel encapsulation during the
   discovery or join process and AC may select one of the supported
   Alternate Tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.

1.  Introduction

   Service Providers are deploying very large Wi-Fi deployments (ranging
   from hundreds of thousands of Access Points, APs (referred to as WTPs
   in CAPWAP terminology) to millions of APs.  These networks are
   designed to carry traffic generated from mobile users.  The volume in
   mobile user traffic is already very large (in the order of petabytes
   per day) and expected to continue growing rapidly.  As a result,
   operators are looking for scalable solutions that can meet the

   increasing demand.  The scalability requirement can be met by
   splitting the control/management plane from the data plane.  This
   enables the data plane to scale independent of the control/management
   plane.  This specification provides a way to enable such separation.

   CAPWAP ([RFC5415], [RFC5416]) defines a tunnel mode that describes
   how the WTP handles the data plane (user traffic).  The following
   types are defined:

   o  Local Bridging: All data frames are locally bridged.
   o  802.3 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.3
      format.
   o  802.11 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.11
      format.

   Figure 1 describes a system with Local Bridging.  The AC is in a
   centralized location.  The data plane is locally bridged by the WTPs
   leading to a system with centralized control plane with distributed
   data plane.  This system has two benefits: 1) reduces the scale
   requirement on data traffic handling capability of the AC and 2)
   leads to more efficient/optimal routing of data traffic while
   maintaining centralized control/management.

   The AC handles control of WTPs.  In addition, the AC also handles the
   IEEE 802.11 management traffic to/ from the stations.  There is
   CAPWAP Control and Data Channel between the WTP and the AC.  Note
   that even though there is no user traffic transported between the WTP
   and AC, there is still a CAPWAP Data Channel.  The CAPWAP Data

   channel carries the IEEE 802.11 management traffic (like IEEE 802.11
   Action Frames).

   Figure 2 shows a system where the tunnel mode is configured to tunnel
   data frames between the WTP and the AC either using 802.3 Tunnel or
   802.11 Tunnel configurations.  Operators deploy this configuration
   when they need to tunnel the user traffic.  The tunneling requirement
   may be driven by the need to apply policy at the Access Router or a
   legal requirement to support lawful intercept of user traffic.  This
   requirement could be met in the locally bridged system (Figure 1) if
   the access router implemented the required policy.  However, in many
   deployments the operator managing the WTP is different than the
   operator managing the Access Router.  When the operators are
   different, the policy has to be enforced in a tunnel termination
   point in the WTP operator's network.

            Figure 2: Centralized Control and Centralized Data

   The key difference with the locally bridged system is that the data
   frames are tunneled to the AC instead of being locally bridged.
   There are two shortcomings with system in Figure 2.  1) They do not
   allow the WTP to tunnel data frames to an endpoint different from the
   AC and 2) They do not allow the WTP to tunnel data frames using any
   encapsulation other than CAPWAP (as specified in Section 4.4.2 of
   [RFC5415]).

   Figure 3 shows a system where the WTP tunnels data frames to an
   alternate entity different from the AC.  The WTP also uses an
   alternate tunnel encapsulation such as such as L2TP, L2TPv3, IP-in-
   IP, IP/GRE, etc.  This enables 1) independent scaling of data plane
   and 2) leveraging of commonly used tunnel encapsulations such as
   L2TP, GRE, etc

       Figure 3: Centralized Control with Alternate Tunnel for Data

   The WTP may support widely used encapsulation types such as L2TP,
   L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IP/GRE, etc.  The WTP advertises the different
   alternate tunnel encapsulation types it can support.  The AC
   configures one of the advertised types.  As shown in the figure there
   is a CAPWAP control and data channel between the WTP and AC.  The
   CAPWAP data channel carries the stations' management traffic as in
   the case of the locally bridged system.  The main reason to maintain
   a CAPWAP data channel is to maintain similarity with the locally
   bridged system.  The WTP maintains three tunnels: CAPWAP Control,
   CAPWAP Data, and another alternate tunnel for the data frame.  The
   data frames are transported by an alternate tunnel between the WTP
   and a tunnel termination point such as an Access Router.  This
   specification describes how the alternate tunnel can be established.
   The specification defines message elements for the WTP to advertise
   support for alternate tunnel encapsulation, the AC to configure
   alternate tunnel encapsulation, and for the WTP to report failure of
   the alternate tunnel.

   The above example describes how the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   may be established.  When the WTP joins the AC, it should indicate
   its alternate tunnel encapsulation capability.  The AC determines
   whether an alternate tunnel configuration is required.  If an
   appropriate alternate tunnel type is selected, then the AC provides
   the alternate tunnel encapsulation message element containing the
   tunnel type and a tunnel-specific information element.  (The tunnel-
   specific information element, for example, may contain information
   like the IP address of the tunnel termination point.)  The WTP sets
   up the alternate tunnel using the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   message element.

   On detecting a tunnel failure, WTP shall forward data frames to the
   AC and discard the frames.  In addition, WTP may dissociate existing
   clients and refuse association requests from new clients.  Depending
   on the implementation and deployment scenario, the AC may choose to
   reconfigure the WLAN (on the WTP) to a local bridging mode or to
   tunnel frames to the AC.  When the WTP detects an alternate tunnel
   failure, the WTP informs the AC using a message element, WTP
   Alternate Tunnel Fail Indication (defined in this specification).
   The message element has a status field that indicates whether the
   message denotes reporting a failure or the clearing of the previously
   reported failure.

   For the case where AC is unreachable but the tunnel end point is
   still reachable, the WTP behavior is up to the implementation.  For
   example, the WTP could either choose to tear down the alternate
   tunnel or let the existing user's traffic continue to be tunneled.

3.  Protocol Considerations

3.1.  Supported Alternate Tunnel Encapsulations

   This message element is sent by a WTP to communicate its capability
   to support alternate tunnel encapsulations.  The message element
   contains the following fields:

           0               1               2               3

   o  Num_Tunnels: This refers to number of tunnel types present in the
      message element.  At least one tunnel type must be present.
   o  Tunnel-Type: This is identified by value defined in Section 3.2

3.2.  Alternate Tunnel Encapsulations Type

   This message element is sent by the AC.  This message element allows
   the AC to select the alternate tunnel encapsulation.  This message
   element may be provided along with the IEEE 802.11 Add WLAN message
   element.  When the message element is present the following fields of
   the IEEE 802.11 Add WLAN element shall be set as follows: MAC mode is
   set to 0 (Local MAC) and Tunnel Mode is set to 0 (Local Bridging).
   The message element contains the following fields


       0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Tunnel-Type: The tunnel type is specified by a 2 byte value.  This
      specification defines the values from zero (0) to five (5) as
      given below.  The remaining values are reserved for future use.

      *  0: CAPWAP.  This refers to a CAPWAP data channel described in
         [RFC5415][RFC5416].
      *  1: L2TP.  This refers to tunnel encapsulation described in
         [RFC2661].

   o  Info Element: This field contains tunnel specific configuration
      parameters to enable the WTP to setup the alternate tunnel.  For
      example if the tunnel type is CAPWAP then this field may contain
      the following (non-exhaustive) list of parameters

      *  Access Router IPv4 address
      *  Access Router IPv6 address
      *  Tunnel DTLS Policy
      *  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Policy

      This specification only defines a generic container for such
      message elements.  We anticipate that these message elements (for
      the different protocols) will be defined in separate documents,
      potentially one for each tunneling protocols.

3.3.  IEEE 802.11 WTP Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication

   The Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation message element is sent by the WTP
   to inform the AC about the status of the Alternate Tunnel.  The
   message element contains the following fields


       0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Length: == 4
   o  Radio ID: The Radio Identifier, whose value is between one (1) and
      31, typically refers to some interface index on the WTP.
   o  WLAN ID: An 8-bit value specifying the WLAN Identifier.  The value
      MUST be between one (1) and 16.
   o  Status: An 8-bit boolean indicating whether the radio failure is
      being reported or cleared.  A value of zero is used to clear the
      event, while a value of one is used to report the event.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA considerations.

   o  <IANA-1>.  This specification defines the Supported Alternate
      Tunnel Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.1.  This
      elements needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message
      Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for
      this element needs to be between 1 and 1023 (see Section 15.7 in
      [RFC5415]).
   o  <IANA-2>.  This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.2.  This element
      needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message Element Type
      registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for this element
      needs to be between 1 and 1023.
   o  <IANA-3>.  This specification defines the IEEE 802.11 WTP
      Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element in
      Section 3.3.  This element needs to be registered in the existing
      CAPWAP Message Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The
      Type value for this element needs to be between 1024 and 2047.
   o  Tunnel-Type: This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element.  This element contains a
      field Tunnel-Type.  The namespace for the field is 16 bits
      (0-65535)).  This specification defines values, zero (0) through
      six (6) and can be found in Section 3.2.  Future allocations of
      values in this name space are to be assigned by IANA using the
      "Specification Required" policy.  IANA needs to create a registry
      called CAPWAP Alternate Tunnel-Types.  The registry format is
      given below.

        Tunnel-Type           Type Value   Reference
        CAPWAP                0            [RFC5415],[RFC5416]
        L2TP                  1            [RFC2661]
        L2TPv3                2            [RFC3931]
        IP-IP                 3            [RFC2003]
        PMIPv6                4            [RFC5213]
        GRE-IPv4              5            [RFC2784]
        GRE-IPv6              6            [RFC2784]

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces three new CAPWAP WTP message elements.
   These elements are transported within CAPWAP Control messages as the
   existing message elements.  Therefore, this document does not
   introduce any new security risks compared to [RFC5415] and [RFC5416].
   In CAPWAP, security for CAPWAP Data Channel is optional and security
   policy is determined by AC.  Similarly, the AC determines the
   security for the Alternate Tunnel between WTP and Alternate Tunnel
   Encapsulation Gateway.  The security considerations described in
   [RFC5415] and [RFC5416] apply here as well.
