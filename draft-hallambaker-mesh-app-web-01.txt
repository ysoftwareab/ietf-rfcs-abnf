2.  Introduction

   The Mathematical Mesh is a personal PKI that permits a user to
   connect multiple devices to a ?personal profile? through which
   application information is shared between the connected devices.  All
   Mesh communications are secured through a combination of end-to-end
   security to protect confidentiality and integrity and transport
   security to provide protection against traffic analysis.

   A full description of the Mathematical Mesh architecture is to be
   found in [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture]
   [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture]

   This document describes a proposed design for a demonstration of
   using the Mesh to provide a cloud based password manager for
   connected Web browsers.  The approach may be readily extended to
   support management of Web bookmarks.

3.  Password Management

   Alice decides to use the Mesh to manage her Web usernames and
   passwords.

   She creates two accounts:

   o  example.com: username 'alice', password 'secret'

   o  cnn.com: username 'alice1', password 'secret'

   The JSON encoding of the password data is as follows:

   {
     "PasswordProfilePrivate": {
       "Entries": [{
           "Sites": ["example.com"],
           "Username": "alice",
           "Password": "password2"}]}}

                                 Figure 1

   The JSON encoded password data is then encrypted and stored in an
   application profile as follows:

   {
     "PasswordProfile": {
       "Identifier": "MBMBD-JYUK7-3BQG2-NZKFE-CMW5J-IUSRB-A"}}

                                 Figure 2

   As we saw earlier, Alice really needs to start using stronger
   passwords.  Fortunately, having access to a password manager means
   that Alice doesn't need to remember different passwords for every
   site she uses any more.

   In addition to offering to use the Mesh to remember passwords, a Web
   browser can offer to automatically generate a password for a site.
   This can be a much stronger password than the user would normally
   want to choose if they had to remember it.

   Alice chooses to use password generation.  Her password manager
   profile is updated to reflect this new choice.

   {
     "PasswordProfilePrivate": {
       "Entries": [{
           "Sites": ["example.com"],
           "Username": "alice",
           "Password": "password2"}]}}

                                 Figure 3

   Alice is happy to use the password manager for her general Web sites
   but not for the password she uses to log in to her bank account.
   When asked if the password should be stored in the Mesh, Alice
   declines and asks not to be asked in the future.

   {
     "PasswordProfilePrivate": {
       "Entries": [{
           "Sites": ["example.com"],
           "Username": "alice",
           "Password": "password2"}]}}

                                 Figure 4

3.1.  Bookmark Management

   The use of the Mesh to store bookmarks is an obvious extension to use
   of the Mesh as a password manage.  The principal differences being
   that the privacy concerns are somewhat less critical than storing

   credentials and a bookmark file is likely to be considerably longer
   than a password file.

   The principal design challenge in adding bookmarks is working out how
   to provide a convenient interface to help the user manage their
   bookmarks.  A hierarchical list of folders quickly becomes cluttered.

4.  Application Schema

5.  Web Password Application Profile Objects

5.1.  Subsection

5.1.1.  Structure: PasswordProfile

   o  Inherits: ApplicationProfile

   Stores usernames and passwords

   [None]

5.1.2.  Structure: PasswordProfilePrivate

   o  Inherits: ApplicationProfilePrivate

   Private part of the profile.

      Boolean (Optional)

   If true, a client MAY offer to automatically generate strong (i.e.
   not memorable) passwords for a user.  A user would not normally want
   to use this feature unless they have access to Mesh password
   management on every device they use to browse the Web

      PasswordEntry [0..Many]

   A list of password credential entries.

      String [0..Many]

   A list of domain names of sites for which clients MUST NOT ask to
   store passwords for.

5.1.3.  Structure: PasswordEntry

   Username password entry for a single site

      String [0..Many]

   DNS name of site *.example.com matches www.example.com etc.

      String (Optional)

   Case sensitive username

      String (Optional)

   Case sensitive password.

6.  Demonstration

   A demonstration of using the Mesh to manage Web browser passwords is
   described.

   The end goal in developing the Mesh application protocols is to
   encourage application providers to provide native support for the
   Mesh rendering extensions obsolete.  Such implementation is likely to
   be best encouraged through provision of a reference library in C.

   I propose implementation of a demonstration as follows:

   Platform Windows

   Browser: Chrome

   Approach:

   Integration to browser features to be supported by platform
   independent extension module

   Mesh integration to be provided by a platform specific executable
   written in C.

   For initial testing / canned demo purposes, the Mesh integration
   module will be a ?stub? that access a data file at a defined location
   on disk that contains the PasswordProfilePrivate data structure.  The
   task of synchronizing data with the Mesh will be performed using the
   Mesh profile management client.

   Further development:

   Implementation of the production extension by modifying the platform
   specific executable.

   Support for macOS by implementing a Mac specific platform executable

   Support for Linux by implementing a Mac specific platform executable

   This approach allows the platform specific extensions to be tailored
   to the cryptographic key management capabilities offered by each
   platform.  For example, the use of a TPM to protect private keys on
   Windows or the Keyring mechanism on macOS.
