Internet-Draft         The IETF Process: a Roadmap         December 2005


1.  Introduction

   BCP 9 [1] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for many
   years.  However, many other process documents exist, some of which
   are partial updates to BCP 9.  This situation is confusing and needs
   to be resolved by a clear set of interlocking documents.  The present
   document suggests a structured way of looking at these documents, and
   some commentary about what already exists or has been proposed.

   It is difficult to linearise a complicated and interlocked process.
   This document presents the roadmap in one particular order, but that
   is not intended to imply priority or importance, and it cannot
   capture all interactions between components.


2.  Outline of roadmap

   For readability of what follows, this section simply lists the
   process document structure.  The following section repeats this
   structure with explanatory text.

      Modifying the process
      General description of workflow in the IETF
      Definition of standards track and related document types
         Specifications
         Information
         Descriptors
      Intellectual Property
         Rights in Contributions
         Rights in Technology
         Trademarks
      Review and approval process
         Criteria for review
         Criteria for approval
            Appeal process
      Bodies involved in the process
         WG procedures
         IESG
         Review panel TBD
         IAB
            Liaison management
         Nomcom
      Conduct of participants
      Publication process
         Requirements
         Format and mechanics for drafts

3.  Details of roadmap

   Note 1: RFC numbers have been used rather than BCP numbers, for
   convenient lookup.  Most of the cited RFCs are BCPs.  Of course, many
   of them may need updating.

   Note 2: Where drafts are cited, it is not implied that they have
   reached consensus.  Internet-Draft citations have not been given in
   detail; see
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/idindex.cgi?command=search_id.

   o  Modifying the process
      A general description of how the IETF modifies its own processes
      does not exist, but probably should.  An experimental procedure is
      described in RFC 3933[2].
   o  General description of workflow in the IETF
      This document does not exist, although the Tao (RFC 3160[24],
      draft-hoffman-taobis) offers hints, but it is needed.
      How ideas for new work enter the IETF, reach a BOF, enter IAB or
      IRTF discussion, and possibly become material for a new or
      existing WG.  How WGs are chartered - the AD role.  How specific
      proposals become drafts and flow through the development, review
      and approval process.

   o  Definition of standards track and related document types.
      This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1].  The newtrk WG
      is chartered to revise the standards track - multiple proposals
      have been floated, most recently draft-carpenter-newtrk-twostep
      and draft-loughney-newtrk-one-size-fits-all.
      *  Specifications
         This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1], covering
         standards track, BCP and experimental documents.  The STD
         (standard) designation is documented in RFC 1311[25].  A
         variance procedure for down-level normative references is in
         RFC 3967[3].  A specific process for advancing MIB documents is
         in RFC 2438 [4].

      *  Information
         This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1], covering
         informational and historic documents.  A distinction between
         obsolete and deprecated documents should probably be added.
      *  Descriptors
         See draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd and
         draft-otis-newtrk-rfc-set.

   o  Intellectual Property
      *  Rights in Contributions
         RFC 3978[5], draft-bradner-author-contributors,
         draft-bradner-rfc-extracts
      *  Rights in Technology
         RFC 3979[6] (Guidelines, RFC 3669[26])
      *  Trademarks
         draft-ietf-ipr-trademarks

   o  Review and approval process
      This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1].
      *  Criteria for review
         Some material was in draft-carpenter-solution-sirs and a
         version can be found at
         http://www.alvestrand.no/ietf/gen/art/review-guidelines.html
      *  Criteria for approval
         Material on current IESG practice can be found in
         draft-iesg-discuss-criteria
         +  Appeal process
            This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1].

   o  Bodies involved in the process
      Bodies involved, RFC 2028[7]; Defining the IETF, RFC 3233[8];
      Mission Statement, RFC 3935[9].
      *  WG procedures
         RFC 2418[10]
      *  IESG
         RFC 3710[27]
      *  Proposed review panel

      *  IAB
         RFC 2850[11]
         +  Liaison management
