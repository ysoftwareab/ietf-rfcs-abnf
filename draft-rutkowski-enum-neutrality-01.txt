   Abstract

   The pursuit by major national Administrations of declared 
   policies of ENUM technical and administrative neutrality among 
   implementations in the marketplace suggest the need for a 
   framework for such neutrality and a focus on interworking 
   among them. [1] [2]  This document draws upon the ENUM Working 
   Group archive of discussions as well as public activities in other 
   standards forums and the marketplace to construct an ENUM options 
   framework for facilitating neutrality.  This framework includes not
   only protocol considerations, but also various critical technical
   and administrative support functions such as authentication and 
   ancillary directory services.

1. Introduction

   In the course of its development of domestic and international
   policies relating to ENUM implementations, the U.S. government
   established a set of principles for ENUM implementation neutrality.
   These principles were conveyed to the ITU-T Meeting of Study Group 2
   (Geneva, 4-14 Sep 2001) along with a call for ongoing work of the
   Study Group to reflect these principles. [1] [2]  These principles
   will be considered if not adopted by multiple Administrations.
   
   The principles call for several ongoing actions among multiple
   technical and operational communities.  These include a requirement
   that "...deployments of ENUM and other similar protocols in any 
   other top level DNS domain, nor restrict the development of other 
   innovative services that may serve as competing ENUM alternatives."
   See [1]
   
   It notes specifically that "the promotion of interworking between 
   different approaches and systems should be an ongoing pursuit."  As
   general norms, ENUM implementations "must not be inconsistent with 
   the positive goals of competition in telecommunications, the 
   encouragement of innovation, the promotion of advanced data 
   services, and the minimization of regulatory involvement and 
   intervention." Ibid.
   
   ENUM is essentially about using a telephone number representation 
   to map in diverse ways to some set of applications on various 
   networked devices employed by a user or user agents for 
   communication purposes.  Telephone numbers are one of many 
   identifiers possible to do this.  The foci of recent ENUM efforts 
   have been Internet based, although there have been numerous efforts 
   undertaken to devise universal communications identifiers over many 
   years. [3]

   The work on ENUM has proceeded over nearly the past decade going 
   back to the pioneering work of Marshall Rose and Carl Malamud in 
   1993 that resulted in the Rose-Malamud schema for representing a 
   telephone number in the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). [4] [5]
   [6] [7]
   
   When more recent efforts to establish telephone number mapping 
   schema arose in the IETF in 1998, an array of different protocols 
   and schema were proposed.  At about the same time, pioneering 
   companies like NetNumber began to develop and introduce ENUM 
   implementations in the commercial marketplace using a combination
   of both DNS and LDAP protocols. [8] [9] [10]

   Last year, one particular ENUM approach based on the Rose-Malamud 
   DNS schema and using a new DNS resource record type developed by 
   Michael Mealling and Ron Daniel - Naming Authority Pointers (NAPTR) 
   was considered by an IETF Working Group and denominated a Proposed 
   Standard.  [11] [12]  Almost immediately, liaison communications via 
   the Internet Society ensued with ITU-T Study Group 2 and ITU staff 
   attempting to establish some kind of ITU related administrative 
   relationship associated with this particular ENUM approach. 

   The proposed standard attracted interest among some technical 
   communities as a possible Internet DNS based mapping service based 
   on telephone numbers to create a "universal communications 
   identifier."  This interest is reflected in some current ITU-T 
   draft material that exclusively deals with the RFC 2916 ENUM schema.

   The RFC 2916 approach is attractive for its simplicity and 
   flexibility in the use of URIs.  However, it has some attributes, 
   however, that may make it unattractive as a universal communications 
   identifier in the public commercial marketplace.  These notably 
   include: 
   
   1) the ambiguous mapping of telephone numbers to end user 
      identifiers, 
   2) the inability to control access to information that user 
      may want to keep private, and 
   3) the tendencies to associate the number with E.164 regulatory 
      regimes and telephone provider relationships.
      
   Additionally, the performance and trust characteristics of the 
   RFC 2916 ENUM approach on a large-scale for some of its potential 
   applications are completely unknown - particularly with multiple 
   tiers.  Although these may not be relevant in closed corporate
   Intranets, these factors represent very substantial consumer 
   marketplace impediments.

   Late last year, NetNumber, Inc. evolved its hybrid DNS/LDAP ENUM 
   solution to technically conform with RFC2916 by providing DNS
   based NAPTR lookups from the domain "e164.com".  Several parties - 
   including VeriSign - have maintained testbeds for experimentation, 
   as required for new Internet protocols to determine protocol 
   workability and marketplace interest.

   At the same time during the past year, a variety of telephony/
   wireless, Internet standards, and large-scale proprietary provider 
   developments have occurred that make it clear that multiple ENUM 
   approaches and continuing evolution of the marketplace will 
   continue.  These developments include an ensemble of standards and 
   services collectively known as Presence and Access Management (PAM), 
   and the emergence of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a kind
   of universal communication platform. [10] - [17]  These commercial
   implementations appear to provide viable solutions to the mapping,
   privacy, customer control, and security problems extant with the
   RFC 2916 approach.  
   
   The resulting environment is almost certain to be richly 
   multiprotocol and highly competitive among small and large players 
   in the commercial marketplace worldwide.


2. Scope

   This is an informational Internet Draft containing a proposed
   technical and administrative framework and elements for ENUM 
   neutrality among implementations.  
   
   Such a framework is important to assure that if some special 
   public governmental or intergovernmental arrangements are sought 
   for particular ENUM offerings in the marketplace, such actions:
   1) avoid prejudice to commercial ENUM offerings employing other 
   element options, and 2) provide for fair and non-discriminatory 
   access by other commercial competitive ENUM providers to publicly
   supported administrative and information resources.


3. ENUM Neutrality Framework and Elements

   In light of the requirement for ENUM neutrality, a wealth of 
   discussions in the ENUM Working Group and other diverse forums, 
   including commercial initiatives in the entwined Presence and 
   Access Management (PAM) sphere, can be assembled as an ensemble 
   of different ENUM related implementation options.

     o Number Structure
       - Rose-Malamud (e.g., 2.2.3.5.5.2.2.8.8.8.1.e164.net)

4. Security Considerations

   The diverse array of ENUM implementations in the marketplace give
   rise to a number of authentication, security, and privacy
   considerations.  This framework attempts to identify some of these
   considerations as elements within the proffered framework.
   
   The providers of ENUM services will likely deploy an array of 
   methods to enhance trust in the mapping of telephone numbers to
   digital objects.  This autonomy suggests the usefulness of common 
   trust methods and the availability of SS7 based services such as
   LIDB and CNAM.
