1.  Description

   [I-D.ietf-rift-rift] specifies a topology information element (TIE)
   that can carry unstructured key value pairs of data.  This document
   defines a registry for the keys to allow for vendor specific values
   being carried without risking a collision with future standardized
   values.

   This document specifies also several well-known keys and their values
   including a registry to allow for easier interoperability between
   implementations.

2.  Key Type Registry

   The first octet of every key is a value from a "RIFT Key Types
   Registry" which may specify the according key structure further.

3.  OUI Key Type

   This section reserves a key type value to indicate a vendor specific
   key with further indication via Organizationally Unique Identifier
   (OUI) which organization the key belongs to.  The value of that first
   octet is TBD1.  The structure of the key is indicated in the figure
   Figure 1.

4.  Well-Known Key Type

   This section reserves a key type value in Key Type Registry to
   indicate a well-known key that all implementations SHOULD support.
   The type is followed by a 3 octets value from a "RIFT Well-Known Key"
   Registry describing the structure of the value it carries.  The
   resulting structure of the key is provided in Figure 2.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section requests registries that help govern RIFT key values via
   usual IANA registry procedures.  All values not suggested as to be
   considered available for assignment.  Allocation of new values is
   always performed via `Expert Review` action.

5.1.  Key Type Registry

   This is registry for key types for keys contained in RIFT KV TIEs.
   The range of values is 0 .. 255

5.1.1.  Requested Entries

    Name         Value   Description
    OUI           TBD1   Followed by 3 octets of OUI.
    Well-Known    TBD2   Followed by 3 octets value from Well-Known Key
    Key                  Type Registry.

5.2.  Well-Known Key Type Registry

   This is registry for key types for well-known keys contained in RIFT
   KV TIEs.  The range of values is 0 .. 2^24-1

5.2.1.  Requested Entries

             Name                       Value   Description
             Illegal                        0   Not allowed.
             MAC/IP Binding              TBD2   To be defined.
             FAM Security Roll-Over Key  TBD2   To be defined.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security concerns to RIFT or other
   specifications referenced in this document given that key value pairs
   are carried in TIEs that are already extensively secured by RIFT
   specification itself.

7.  Acknowledgements

   To be provided.
