Abstract

   This document registers the 'ENUMservice' 'void' using the URI
   scheme 'mailto:' as per the IANA registration process defined in the
   ENUM specification RFC3761 [2]. This 'ENUMservice' SHALL be used to
   indicate that the E.164 number or E.164 number range connected to
   the domain used in DNS as described in [2] is not assigned to an
   end-user in case of an E.164 number or to a communication service
   provider in case of an E.164 number range.

Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].

1. Introduction

   ENUM Registrations are used to make available Universal Resource
   Identifiers and other data associated with an assigned E.164 number.
   For ENUM, the E.164 number assignee has the exclusive right to
   register a domain associated with "their" number, and has exclusive
   control over the content made available in this zone.

   If an assignee of an E.164 number does not choose to register the
   associated ENUM domain, then any DNS query on that domain will
   return a response indicating 'no such domain' (NXDOMAIN, code 3)[4].

   A major use of ENUM registrations is to "publish" URIs indicating
   alternative destination, so that potential callers who only know the
   E.164 number can find the appropriate URI to contact the registrant.

   If no registration exists associated with an E.164 number, then that
   potential caller (or their agents) have no further information, and
   so must "fall back" to passing the call to their default network,
   assuming that this will route the call appropriately. For voice
   calls this default network is usually the PSTN; the call is
   processed as a "normal" phone call.


2. The problem

   Some National Number Regulatory Authorities (NRA) have chosen to
   allocate a particular part of the E.164 number space under their
   control for exclusive use of ENUM registrations; that is, they have
   decided that calls to E.164 numbers in this range MUST be processed
   using ENUM, and delivered to the URI generated as a result of a
   successful ENUM query. A call cannot be simply "dropped" onto the
   default network for delivery, as there is no direct association
   between the E.164 number and a terminal connected to that network.

   This raises an issue. If the originating user agent is unaware that
   this choice has been made for this part of the number space, they
   may assume that receipt of an NXDOMAIN response to a query on an
   E.164 number means that they should deliver the call onwards using
   their default call processing method. As control of the E.164 number
   space is distributed, it is quite possible that the user agent in
   one country is unaware of the assignment choices for an E.164 number
   under the allocation authority (NRA) of another country. This user
   agent may deliver the call using the normal mechanism, and it will
   fail.

   What would be useful is a mechanism "between" a registration holding
   NAPTRs with URIs and the lack of a domain registration. In this way,
   an entity who is responsible for E.164 numbers in a range can
   indicate that a particular number has not been assigned to anyone
   for communications service provision, and so there is no-one with
   the right to register the associated domain. For example, if a
   communications service provider has been allocated responsibility
   for delivering calls to endpoints identified with E.164 numbers in a
   block, then they may have some numbers in that block that are
   currently unused. These E.164 numbers are not used to terminate
   calls to end users.

   As there is no end user as an assignee for an unused number, there
   cannot be a registration for the associated ENUM domain. An
   originating user agent cannot differentiate this state from the one
   in which there is an end user as a number assignee, but that they
   have chosen not to "publish" other contacts. In effect, it would be
   more useful if the originating end user could receive a response
   that states "there is no service via this number", as opposed to
   "there may be service via this number, but there are no alternative
   contacts available".


3. The proposed solution

   We propose an explicit indication of this "number unassigned" state.
   This uses a NAPTR in the "enclosing" zone, with an enumservice
   called VOID that should be taken as an assertion that the associated
   E.164 number is not assigned to an end user for communications
   service; it's an unused number.

   This NAPTR can also be used by an NRA to indicate number blocks that
   it has reserved or has not allocated, or has not assigned to a
   service provider.

   Note that, where a number (or number range) has not been assigned to
   an end user, there cannot be an associated ENUM registration (or
   range of registrations). Thus there cannot be information made

   available via ISIS/Whois on the identity of the current "owner" of
   the number. For this reason, we propose that the VOID indication
   also includes an email address by which the authority responsible
   for this number (or range) can be contacted. This may not be the
   same entity as the one that maintains the DNS service for that
   "enclosing zone"; often the NRA will sub-contract a Registry
   Operator to maintain the DNS, but it is the NRA who is the authority
   for the E.164 number range, not that Registry Operator.


4. ENUM Service Registration

   As defined in [2], the following is a template covering information
   needed for the registration of the enumservice specified in this
   document.

      Enumservice Name: "void"

      Type(s): "void"

      Subtype(s): "mailto"

      URI Scheme(s): "mailto:"

      Functional Specification: The proposed solution in section 3.

         Definition of expected action:

         If a NAPTR with this ENUMservice is received, it indicates
         that the queried E.164 number is currently unassigned to an
         end user for communications service.

         The recipient SHOULD treat this response as if they had
         received a "number not in service" indication from a
         terminating network.

      Security considerations: see section 5

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Authors:

      Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for authors contact
      details see Authors' Addresses section)

      Any other information that the author deems interesting: See
      above.

5. Example


     $ORIGIN 0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
     3.8.0   NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+void:mailto"
        "!^.*$!mailto:num-drama-info@ofcom.org.uk!"

   This indicates that the controller of the number block +441632960xxx
   does not provide telephony service via the number +441632960038; it
   is not assigned to an end user.


6. Security considerations

   DNS does not make policy decisions about the records that it shares
   with an inquirer.  All DNS records must be assumed to be available
   to all inquirers at all times. The information provided within an
   ENUM record set must therefore be considered to be open to the
   public.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the
   DNS, and the applicability of DNSSEC[5] to these, is provided in[2].

   The specific issues applicable to this registration are:

   (i) by including an email address, the responsible authority is
       making this available globally. They should expect that the
       published email address will be used to send unsolicited
       commercial email to them.

   (ii) by publishing the email address, they expose the identity of
        the entity that has authority over this E.164 number (or number
        range).

   (iii) by constructing a DNS response holding a VOID NAPTR, a third
         party could initiate a denial of service attack on the
         assignee of a number (or number range). The recipient of a
         "spoofed" response would react by assuming that the associated
         E.164 number is not in service, so denying calls to that
         number.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document registers the E2U+void ENUM service according to
   specifications and guidelines in RFC 3761 [2] and the definitions in
   this document.
