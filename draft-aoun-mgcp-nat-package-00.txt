Abstract 
    
   Network Address translators impact several application protocols in 
   the internet; this document discusses how the MGCP protocol could 
   work through NATs. Only the signaling protocol message traversal is 
   discussed in the document. The VoIP streams NAT traversal are 
   already documented and researched within the MIDCOM WG.

1  Overview 
    
   Network Address translators ([NAT]) impact several application 
   protocols in the Internet. [NAT-COMP] provides a good reference on 
   the impact of NATs on certain protocols. This document defines how 
   the MGCP [MGCP] protocol could work in networks where  NATs are 
   deployed. Only the signaling protocol interface is discussed (i.e. 
   the MGCP message traversal through NATs). The MGCP controlled, VoIP 
   streams' NAT traversal is already documented and researched within 
   the MIDCOM IETF WG [MDCMFW]. 
    
    
2  Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
3  MGCP NAT complications 
    
   When Media Gateways (MGW) controlled with the MGCP protocol are 
   deployed behind NATs, the Media Gateway Controller (MGC) should be 
   allowed to control the MGW transparently (or almost transparently). 
    
   When the MGW establishes MGCP communication with its MGC, the NAT  
   creates a bind which includes the private IP address and port of the 
   MGCP client on the MGW and the public IP address and port allocated 
   by the NAT (case a). In some NAT implementations the binding could 
   also include the IP address of the MGC (case b) or both the IP 
   address and port of the MGC (case c). 
    
   NATs behaving as in : 
        -case a) are known as full cone NATs 
        -case b) are known as restricted cone NATs 
        -case c) are known as restricted port cone NATs 
    
   These NATs belong to the traditional NAT family [TNAT] and are 
   documented in [STUN]. The created NAT bind will have an associated 
   watch dog inactivity timer. In the event that no packets are sent 
   from the MGW to the MGC through the bind over the established 
   duration, the bind will be removed by the NAT. 
    
   When the bind  is removed by the NAT, the MGC will no longer be able 
   to contact the MGW.

                 A NAT package for MGCP NAT traversal        June 2002
                                    
    
    
    
   Some MGC implementations always reply to the MGW on the MGCP client 
   well known port. Since the NAT has translated the well known port, 
   the MGC should reply back to the source address and port of the 
   received MGCP datagram. 
    
3.1 Proposed keep alive mechanism 
 
   There are 2 possible ways to reuse existing MGCP messages as keep 
   alives: 
    
   a) Use the audit message (AUEP, AUdit EndPoint) sent by the MGC to 
      which the MGW will reply, thus the response to the AUEP will 
      serve as the keep alive. 
    
  b) Use an event notification message, where the event is persistent. 
     The event in this case being that the MGW watch dog inactivity 
     timer has timed-out. 
    
   Method a) meets the requirement by sending a response to the audit 
   request but requires the MGC host to have an inactivity timer (which 
   is already required but with a bigger auditing period) as well as 
   processing the audit message, and processing the audit response 
   message. Moreover, this method doesn't allow the MGC to reach its 
   controlled MGW after fail-over. 
    
   Method b) requires the MGW to notify the MGC each time the 
   inactivity watch dog timer times out. This method allows the MGC to 
   communicate with the MGW when the MGC recovers from a  failure  and 
   keeps the bind active by generating a message from the MGW to the 
   MGC. 
    
3.2 Method of operation of the proposed keep alive mechanism 
    
   This draft provides a solution to the NAT expiration problem by 
   defining a timer and a persistent package/event.  
    
   The MGW must define a "keep alive" timer. The duration of the "keep 
   alive" timer is determined by the NAT bind's watch dog inactivity 
   timer. The MGW must enable the "keep alive" timer after successful 
   registration and only when at least one of its endpoints are 
   supervised with a NotificationRequest. The MGW must reset the "keep 
   alive" timer each time the MGW sends an MGCP message. The MGW must 
   disable the "keep alive" timer if it becomes Disconnected. 
    
   Expiry of the "keep alive" timer must cause the MGW to generate a 
   MGCP Notification of the persistent event defined below.

   If the MGW doesn't receive a response to the Notify message after 
   several retransmissions, the standard MGCP algorithm applies.  
    
   The keep alive expiry persistent event abides by the persistent 
   event rules as defined in [MGCP]. Therefore, the MGW must be under 
   supervision of a NotificationRequest (encapsulated or command) prior 
   to reporting the event. 
     
    
    
    
4  NAT package description 
    
   Package Name : NAT Package 
   PackageID    : NAT 
   Version      : 1 
    
   This package is a new MGCP package. In its first version, only one 
   event is defined (keep alive). 
    
   Events MUST always be prefixed with the "NAT" package name. 
    
   4.1 Properties 
    
      None 
    
   4.2 Events 
    
      Keep Alive 
    
      EventID    : NAT/ka 
      Event Type : Persistent 
       
      This event must be reported by the MGW when its keep alive timer 
      expires.  The timer is reset each time the MGW sends any MGCP 
      message (including MGW responses to commands from the call agent, 
      such as "200 xxx OK" acknowledgements).  
       
      The notification of this event on an endpoint must not cancel any 
      signals being generated on that endpoint. 
 
       
  4.3 Signals 
   
      None 
   
  4.4 Statistics 
   
      None 
   
  4.5 Procedures

                 A NAT package for MGCP NAT traversal        June 2002
                                    
    
      Since the "all of" wildcard convention cannot be used with the 
      MGCP Notify (NTFY) message the MGW must choose an arbitrary 
      supervised endpoint from which to generate the event. Supervised 
      endpoints are those that are operating under a received 
      NotificationRequest (encapsulated or command) but are not in the 
      notification state.  Only one Notify message is required from the 
      MGW when the keep alive timer expires (i.e. it should not be 
      reported from every endpoint). This event is not a call 
      processing event and it does not occur on an endpoint; therefore, 
      this event must not cancel any signals generated on the chosen 
      endpoint.  
       
      If no response is received from the call agent, the normal 
      retransmission algorithm for the message should be applied 
      (bearing in mind that each of the retransmissions will also reset 
      the keep alive timer).  
       
      If the MGC replies to the MGW's notify message (notifying the 
      inactivity timer expiration) with a negative acknowledgment (i.e. 
      error code 522, unknown event), the negative acknowledgment 
      should be ignored. 
       
      Gateways that implement this package MUST provide control of 
      operation through a provisioning system.  This should include the 
      ability to enable or disable the keep alive timer completely, and 
      allow configuration of the timer duration in seconds.   
   
  4.6 Use Cases: Example Message Flow 
   
      The keep alive timer must be reset each time the MGW sends any 
      MGCP message. For example: 
   
         200 123 OK   (keep alive timer reset) 
       
      If the timer expires (no MGCP message is sent by the MGW for the 
      duration of the keep alive timer), the MGW reports the keep alive 
      event: 
       
      ------> 
         NTFY 456 aaln/1@mgw.nortel.com MGCP 1.0 
         X: 536 
         O: NAT/ka 
       
      The call agent acknowledges: 
       
      <------ 
         200 456 OK 
       
    
5  IANA consideration 
    
   As the NAT package doesn't exist, the MGCP NAT package will follow 
   the IANA MGCP package reservation process as defined in [MGCP]. The

   authors of the draft will request from IANA a specific MGCP NAT 
   package identifier.

   Security considerations in [MGCP] apply to the introduced keep alive
