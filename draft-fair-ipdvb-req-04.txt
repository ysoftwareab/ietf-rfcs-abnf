     Abstract 
         
        This document describes a framework for the transport of IP 
        Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS has 
        been widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services, but 
        also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. Examples 
        include the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) and Advanced Television 
        Systems Committee (ATSC) Standards for Digital Television.  
         
        It identifies the need for a set of Internet standards defining the 
        interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream and an IP subnetwork. 
        It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP datagrams, and 
        proposes protocols to perform IPv6/IPv4 resolution, to associate IP 
        packets with the properties of the Logical Channels provided by an 
        MPEG-2 TS.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
             1. Introduction 
         
        This document identifies requirements for a framework for transport 
        of IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG2]. The 
        framework is also designed to be compatible with services based on 
        MPEG-2, for example the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) architecture, 
        the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) system [ATSC; ATSC-
        G], and other similar MPEG-2 based transmission systems. Such 
        systems typically provide unidirectional (simplex) physical and link 
        layer standards, and have been defined for a wide range of physical 
        media (e.g. Terrestrial TV [ETSI-DVBT; ATSC-PSIP-TC], Satellite TV 
        [ETSI-DVBS; ATSC-S],Cable Transmission [ETSI-DVBC; ATSC-PSIP-TC]).

        Although many MPEG-2 systems carry a mixture of types of data, MPEG-
        2 components may, and are, also used to build IP-only networks.  In 
        this case, standard system components offer advantages of mass 
        market and improved interoperability.  Such networks often do not 
        implement all parts of a DVB / ATSC system, and may for instance 
        support minimal, or no, signalling of Service Information (SI) 
        tables.  
      
         
     1.1 TS Logical Channels 
         
        The service provided by an MPEG-2 transport multiplex offers a 
        number of parallel TS Logical Channels.  Each MPEG-2 TS logical 
        channel is uniquely identified by the Packet ID, PID, value carried 
        in the header of each MPEG-2 TS Packet. The PID value is a 13 bit 
        field and, thus, the number of channels is limited to 8192, some of 
        which are reserved for transmission of SI tables. Non-reserved TS 
        Logical Channels may be use to carry audio [ISO-AUD], video [ISO-

        VID], IP packets [ISO-DSMCC; ETSI-DAT; ATSC-DAT], or other data 
        [ISO-DSMCC; ETSI-DAT; ATSC-DAT]. The value 8191 indicates a null 
        packet, used to maintain the physical bearer bit rate when there are 
        no other MPEG-2 TS Packets to be sent.

        TS Logical Channels are independently numbered on each MPEG-2 TS 
        Mux.  In most cases the data sent over the TS Logical Channels will 
        differ for different multiplexes. The above figure shows two MPEG-2 
        TS Multiplexes (A and B).  
         
        There are cases where the same data may be distributed over two or 
        more multiplexes (e.g., some SI tables; multicast content which 
        needs to be received by Receivers tuned to either MPEG-2 TS; unicast 
        data were the Receiver may be in either/both two potentially 
        overlapping MPEG-2 transmission cells). In figure 2, each multiplex 
        carries 3 MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels. These Logical Channels may 
        differ (TS-LC-A-1, TS-LC-A-2, TS-LC-B-2, TS-LC-B-1), or may be 
        common to both MPEG-2 TS Multiplexes (i.e. TS-LC-A-3 and TS-LC-B-3 
        carry identical content). 
         
        Similarities in the way PIDs are used may be observed with the 
        operation of virtual channels in ATM, however, unlike ATM, a PID 
        defines a unidirectional broadcast channel and not a point-to-point 
        link; there is, as yet, no specified interface for connection setup, 
        or for signalling mappings of IP flows to PIDs, or to set the 
        Quality of Service, QoS, assigned to an TS Logical Channel.

     1.2 MPEG-2 Transmission Networks 
         
        Packet data for transmission over the MPEG-2 transport multiplex is 
        passed to an encapsulator.  This receives Sub-Network Data Units, 
        SNDUs (e.g., Ethernet frames or IP packets) and formats each SNDU 
        into a series of TS Packets adding an encapsulation header and 
        trailer (see section 5).  
         
        There are many possible topologies for the MPEG-2 Transmission 
        Network. In a simple example, one or more TS are processed by a 
        MPEG-2 multiplexor resulting in a TS Multiplex. That is forwarded 
        over a physical bearer towards one or more Receivers. See figure 3.

        In a more complex example, the same TS may be fed to multiple MPEG-2 
        multiplexors and these may, in turn, feed other MPEG-2 multiplexors 
        (remultiplexing). Remultiplexing may occur in several places. One 
        example is a satellite that provides on-board processing of the TS 
        packets, multiplexing the TS Logical Channels received from one or

        more up-link physical bearers (TS Multiplex) to one (or more in the 
        case of broadcast/multicast) down-link physical bearer (TS 
        Multiplex). As part of the remultiplexing process, a remultiplexor 
        may renumber the PID values associated with one or more TS Logical 
        Channels to prevent clashes between input TS Logical Channels with 
        the same PID carried on different input multiplexes. 
         
        In all cases, the final result is a "TS Multiplex" which is 
        transmited over the physical bearer towards the Receiver. 
         
        To receive IP packets sent over a MPEG-2 transport multiplex, a 
        Receiver needs to identify the specific TS Multiplex (physical link) 
        and also the TS Logical Channel (i.e. PID value of a logical link). 
        It is common for a number of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels to carry 
        SNDUs, and a Receiver must therefore filter (accept) IP packets sent 
        with a number of PID values, and must independently reassemble each 
        SNDU.  
         
        A Receiver that simultaneously receives from several TS Logical 
        Channels, may utilise receiver hardware to filter other unwanted TS 
        Logical Channels. Packets for one IP flow (i.e. a specific 
        combination of IP source and destination addresses) must be sent 
        using the same PID. It should not be assumed that all IP packets are 
        carried on a single PID, multiple PIDs must be allowed. Most 
        Receivers currently have a limit on the maximum number of active 
        PIDs (e.g. 32), although if needed, future systems may reasonably be 
        expected to support more.   
         
        In some cases, Receivers may need to select TS Logical Channels from 
        a number of simultaneously active TS Multiplexes. To do this, they 
        need multiple physical receive interfaces (e.g., RF front-ends and 
        demodulators). Some applications also envisage the concurrent 
        reception of IP Packets over other media (that may not necessarily 
        use MPEG-2 transmission).  
         
        Bi-directional (duplex) transmission can be provided using a MPEG-2 
        transmission network by using one of a number of alternate return 
        channel schemes [DVB-RC]. Duplex IP paths may also be supported 
        using non-MPEG-2 return links. One example of such an application is 
        that of Uni-Directional Link Routing, UDLR [RFC3077]. 
         
        The DVB family of standards currently defines a mechanism for 
        transporting an IP packet, or Ethernet frame using the Multi-
        Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) [ETSI-DAT]. This scheme is also 
        supported in ATSC [ATSC-DAT; ATSC-DATG]]. It allows transmission of 
        IP packets or Ethernet style frames in the control plane associated 
        with audio/video transport. Data is formatted as if it were a table 
        section. It includes a set of optional header components and 
        requires decoding of the control headers.  This processing is 
        therefore not optimal for IP, since it incurs significant receiver 
        processing overhead and some extra link overhead [CLC99].

           Packet ID, PID, value denoting the MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel). 
         
        The complete MPEG-2 transmission network may be managed by a 
        transmission service operator. In such cases, the assignment of 
        addresses and TS Logical Channels at Receivers are usually under the 
        control of the service operator.  Examples of this include a TV 
        distribution network, or ISP offering an Internet service to her 
        customers.  MPEG-2 transmission networks are also used for private 
        networks. These typically involve a smaller number of terminals and 
        do not require the same level of centralised control as a managed 
        network. Examples of this include companies wishing to link DVB-
        capable routers to form links within an Internet subnetwork. 
         
     1.3 Proposed Framework 
         
        The framework proposed in this document describes a set of protocols 
        to support transmission of IP packets over the MPEG-2 TS. A key 
        characteristic of these networks is that they may provide link-level 
        broadcast capability, and many applications require support for very 
        large numbers of subnetwork nodes.  Some or all of these protocols 
        may also be applicable to other subnetworks, e.g,. other MPEG-2 
        transmission networks, regenerative satellite links [ETSI-BSM], and 
        some types of broadcast wireless links. The key goals are to reduce 
        complexity when using the system, while improving performance, 
        increasing flexibility, and providing opportunities for better 
        integration with IP Internet services. 
         
     Since most MPEG-2 transmission networks are bandwidth-limited, the 
     framework needs to be simple, robust, extensible (i.e. provide support 
     for a range of link services), and have good link efficiency (i.e. 
     small overhead). Supporting protocols need to provide resolution of IP 
     flows to the TS Logical Channels provided by the MPEG-2 TS. The Logical 
     Channels provide multiplexing, addressing, and error reporting. The 
     Logical Channel is also the basis of providing Quality of Service 
     (QoS). Mapping functions are required to relate this to IP-level QoS.  
     A key goal will be to provide functions in a dynamic way, permitting 
     integration with other IP protocols. Collectively, these form MPEG-2 TS 
     address resolution.

        TS PACKET: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over an MPEG-2 
        multiplex [ISO-MPEG]; it corresponds to the cells, of e.g. ATM

     3. Motivation 
         
        The network layer protocols to be supported by this framework are: 
         
        (i)    IPv4 Unicast packets, destined for a single end host 
        (ii)   IPv4 Broadcast packets, sent to all end systems in an IP 
               network 
        (iii)  IPv4 Multicast packets 
        (iv)   IPv6 Unicast packets, destined for a single end host 
        (v)    IPv6 Multicast packets 
        (vi)   Packets with compressed IPv4 / IPv6 packet headers (e.g. 
               [RFC1114; RFC2507; RFC3095]) 
        (vii)  Bridged Ethernet frames 
      
        The framework describes:  
         
        (i)    The framework will offer guidance on which MPEG-2 features 
               are pre-requisites for this service, and any optional fields 
               that impact performance/correct operation. 
         
        (ii)   Standards will be defined to provide an efficient and 
               flexible encapsulation scheme that may be easily implemented 
               in an Encapsulator or Receiver. The framework must support 
               IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols, and should support alternate 
               payloads ± such as bridged, compressed packets, and extension 
               options. The payload encapsulation requires a type field for 
               the SNDU to indicate the type of packet. 
         
        (iii)  Standards will be defined to associate a particular IP 
               address with a Network Point of Attachment (NPA) (e.g. a MAC 
               Address). This process resembles the IPv4 Address Resolution 
               Protocol, ARP, or IPv6 Neighbour Discovery, ND, protocol [AR-
               DRAFT]. The standard must be compatible with IPv6 
               autoconfiguration. 
      
        (iv)   Standards will be defined to associate a MPEG-2 TS interface 
               with one or more specific TS Logical Channels (PID, TS 
               Multiplex). Bindings are required for both unicast 
               transmission, and multicast reception. In the case of Ipv4 
               this must also support network broadcast. To make the schemes 
               robust to loss and state changes within the MPEG-2 
               transmission network, a soft-state approach may prove 
               desirable.  This could be implemented via descriptors sent in 
               the SI tables (e.g. using the existing MPEG-2 control plane), 
               via one or more new SI tables, or in-band by a protocol using 
               a data channel (e.g. utilising UDP) [AR-DRAFT]. 
      
        (v)    Existing standards do not address many areas, which are 
               desirable for Internet Service provision, (e.g., mapping of 
               QoS functions, such as IP QoS/DSCP and RSVP, to under-lying 
               MPEG-2 TS QoS, multi-homing and mobility). The need for and 
               scope of this is to be determined.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
      
        (vi)   Security. The framework must permit use of IPSEC and clearly 
               identify any security issues concerning the specified 
               protocols. The security issues need to consider two cases: 
               unidirectional transfer (in which communication is only from 
               the sending IP end host to the receiving IP end host) and bi-
               directional transfer.  Consideration should also be given to 
               security of the TS Multiplex: the need for closed user groups 
               and the use of MPEG-2 TS encryption. 
      
        (vii)  Management. There may be a need for standardised SNMP MIBs 
               and error reporting procedures. The need for and scope of 
               this is to be determined. 
      
      
     The specified framework and techniques to be developed should be suited 
     to a range of systems employing the MPEG-2 TS, and may also suit other 
     (sub)networks offering similar transfer capabilities.

     4. IP Transport Service. 
         
        The section identifies key needs and provides examples of mechanisms 
        that may be used to perform the encapsulation of IPv4 and IPv6 
        multicast and unicast packets over MPEG-2 transmission networks. 
         
     4.1 Options for Encapsulation  
         
        To transmit packet data over an MPEG-2 transmission network requires 
        that individual SNDUs (e.g. IPv4, IPv6 packets, or bridged Ethernet 
        Frames) are encapsulated using a convergence protocol. The following 
        encapsulations are currently standardised for MPEG-2 transmission 
        networks: 
         
        (i)     Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE). 
               The Multi-Protocol Encapsulation, MPE, specification of DVB 
               [ETSI-DAT] uses private Sections for the transport of IP 
               packets and uses encapsulation that is similar to the IEEE 
               LAN/MAN standards [LLC]. Data packets are encapsulated in 
               datagram sections that are compliant with the DSMCC section 
               format for private data. Some Receivers may exploit section-
               processing hardware to perform a first-level filter of the 
               packets that arrive at the Receiver.  
                
               The section header also includes fields, which may be used by 
               a Receiver to filter datagrams assigned to the same TS 
               Logical Channel.  This feature allows several logical 
               networks to be established without assigning PID values to 
               each of the services. Section filtering is especially well 
               suited for TV broadcast environments where remultiplexing 
               comes into play. 
         
               This encapsulation makes use of a MAC-level network point of 
               attachment address. The address format conforms to the 
               ISO/IEEE standards for LAN/MAN LLC]. The 48-bit MAC address 
               field contains the MAC address of the destination; it is 
               distributed over six 8-bit fields, labeled MAC_address_1 to 
               MAC_address_6. The MAC_address_1 field contains the most 
               significant byte of the MAC address, while MAC_address_6 
               contains the least significant byte.  How many of these bytes 
               are significant is optional and defined by the value of the 
               broadcast descriptor table [SI-DAT] sent separately over 
               another MPEG-2 TS within the TS multiplex. 
         
               MPE is currently a widely used scheme. Due to investments in 
               existing equipment, usage is likely to continue in some

        (ii)   Data Piping. 
               The Data Piping profile [ETSI-DAT] is a minimum overhead, 
               simple and flexible profile that makes no assumptions 
               concerning the format of the data being sent. In this 
               profile, the Receiver is intended to provide PID filtering, 
               packet reassembly according to [DVB-SIDAT-368], error 
               detection and optional Conditional Access (link encryption).  
         
               The specification allows the user data stream to be 
               unstructured or organized into packets. The specific 
               structure is transparent to the Receiver. It may conform to 
               any protocol, e.g., IP, Ethernet, NFS, FDDI, MPEG-2 PES, etc. 
               The ULE specification [IPDVB-ULE] is an example of protocol 
               that uses this profile. 
         
        (iii)  Data Streaming. 
               The data broadcast specification profile [ETSI-DAT] for PES 
               tunnels (Data Streaming) supports unicast and multicast data 
               services that require a stream-oriented delivery of data 
               packets. This encapsulation maps an IP packet into a single 
               PES Packet payload Data Streaming is intended to handle a 
               single stream of data at a high data rate using standard 
               demultiplexing ICs (e.g. developed for STBs) that have been 
               designed for video streams. Transporting data packets at the 
               PES level offers the benefits of PES layer functions 
               integrated into the chip sets, e.g. handling of program 
               specific information (tables), scrambling and synchronization 
               with other TS. 
         
               The standard PES Packet as defined in table 2-18 of [ISO-
               MPEG] can also be used as a container for data packets. The 
               two values for the stream_id are "private_stream_1" and  
               "private_stream_2". The private_stream_2 permits the use of 
               the short PES header with limited overhead. This makes it 
               attractive for publicly accessible multicast distribution 
               services. The private_stream_1 makes available the scrambling 
               control and the timing and clock reference features of the 
               PES layer. The "PES_data_packet_header_length" will be used 
               in this context to insert stuffing bytes. This is an 
               important aspect since the payload can be aligned to 32-bit 
               word boundaries. 
         
               When the "data_identifier" field is used in conjunction with 
               the first 4 bits of the "sub_stream_id" field it forms a 12 
               bit field. This carries a descriptor of the next level 
               protocol. The list of protocol codes will be managed by 
               [EUTELSAT], and the values of the part stored into the 
               "data_identifier" field will be in the range 0x80-0xFF 
               (assigned by DVB as user defined). The remaining 4 bits of 
               the "sub_stream_id" field are used for storing the current 
               version of the encapsulation format.

     5. Encapsulation Protocol Requirements 
         
        The aim of a encapsulation protocol is to transport a SNDU over the 
        MPEG-2 TS service and provide the appropriate mechanisms to deliver 
        this to the Receiver IP interface. A convergence protocol typically 
        adds header fields before a SNDU that carry protocol control 
        information (e.g., length of SNDU, Receiver address, multiplexing 
        information, payload type, sequence numbers).  The SNDU payload is 
        typically followed by a trailer, which carries an Integrity Check 
        (e.g., Cyclic Redundancy Check, CRC). Some protocols also add 
        additional control information and/or padding to or after the 
        trailer.

               | Header |            SNDU         | Integrity Check |

                       packet) to form an MPEG-2 Payload Unit. 
         
        Examples of existing convergence protocols include ATM AAL5 [ITU-
        AAL5], and MPEG-2 MPE [ETSI-DAT]. This section describes existing 
        standard encapsulations used with MPEG-2 transmission networks. The 
        section also reviews the requirements for performing an 
        encapsulation optimised for IP. 
         
        The existing proposals and standards for use with MPEG-2 (described 
        in the previous section) all introduce overhead that consumes link 
        capacity and receiver processing power. The then current state of 
        chip technology played an important role in defining these 
        encapsulations and it may be argued that there was little previous 
        implementation experience considered. Arguably, too much 
        consideration was paid to existing digital video/audio technology 
        and too little to Internet protocol aspects. 
         
        5.1 Convergence Functions  
         
        Carrying IP packets over a TS Logical Channel involves several 
        convergence protocol functions: 
         
        5.1.1 Payload_Unit Delimitation 
         
        MPEG-2 indicates the start of a Payload Unit in a new TS Packet with 
        a "start_of_payload_unit_indicator" (PUSI)_[ISO-MPEG] carried in the 
        4B TS Packet header. The PUSI is a 1 bit flag that has normative 
        meaning [ISO_MPEG] for TS Packets that carry PES Packets or PSI 
        data.  
         
        When the payload of a TS Packet contains PES data, a PUSI value of 
        '1' indicates the TS Packet payload starts with the first byte of a 
        PES Packet. A value of '0' indicates that no PES Packet starts in 
        this TS Packet. If the PUSI is set to '1', then one, and only one, 
       
     Expires June 2003                                            [page 15] 
     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
        PES Packet starts in the TS Packet.  
         
        When the payload of the TS Packet contains PSI data, a PUSI value of 
        '1' indicates the first byte of the TS Packet payload carries a 
        payload pointer that indicates the position of the first byte of the 
        Payload Unit (Section) being carried; if the TS Packet does not 
        carry the first byte of a Section, the PUSI is set to '0', 
        indicating that there is no payload pointer.  
         
        Using this PUSI bit, the start of the first Payload Unit in a TS 
        Packet is exactly known by the Receiver, unless that TS Packet has 
        been corrupted or lost in the transmission. In which case, the 
        payload is discarded until the next TS Packet is received with a 
        PUSI value of '1'. 
         
        The encapsulation should allow packing of more than one SNDU into 
        the same TS Packet and should not limit the number of SNDUs that can 
        be sent in a TS Packet.  In addition, it should allow an IP 
        Encapsulator to insert padding when there is an incomplete TS Packet 
        payload. A mechanism needs to be identified to differentiate this 
        padding from the case where another encapsulated SNDU follows.  
         
        A combination of the PUSI and a Length Indicator (see below) allows 
        an efficient MPEG-2 convergence protocol to receive accurate 
        delineation of packed SNDUs.  The MPEG-2 standard [ISO_MPEG] however 
        does not specify how private data should use the PUSI bit.  
         
        5.1.2 Length Indicator 
         
        Most services using MPEG-2 include a length field in the payload 
        header to allow the Receiver to identify the end of a payload unit 
        (e.g. PES Packet, Section, or in the case of the IP service, an 
        SNDU). 
         
        When parts of more than two Payload Units are carried in the same TS 
        Packet, only the start of the first is indicated by the Payload 
        Pointer. Placement of a Length Indicator in the encapsulation header 
        allows a Receiver to determine the number of bytes until the start 
        of the next encapsulated SNDU. This placement also provides the 
        opportunity for the Receiver to pre-allocate an appropriate-sized 
        memory buffer to receive the reassembled SNDU. 
         
        A Length Indicator is required, and should be carried in the 
        encapsulation header.  This should support SNDUs of at least the MTU 
        size offered by Ethernet (1500 bytes). Although the IPv4 and IPv6 
        packet format permits an IP packet of size up to 64 KB, such packets 
        are seldom seen on the current Internet. Since high speed links are 
        often limited by the packet forwarding rate of routers, there has 
        been a tendency for Internet core routers to support MTU values 
        larger than 1500 bytes. A value of 16 KB is not uncommon in the core 
        of the current Internet.  This would seem a suitable maximum size 
        for an MPEG-2 transmission network.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
         
        5.1.3 Next Level Protocol Type 
         
        There is a need to identify the type of payload being transported 
        (e.g., to differentiate IPv4, IPv6, arp messages, and compressed 
        packet headers). Most protocols use a type field to identify a 
        specific process at the next higher layer that is the originator or 
        the recipient of the payload (SNDU). This method is used by IPv4, 
        IPv6, and also by the original Ethernet protocol (DIX). OSI uses the 
        concept of a 'Selector' for this, (e.g. in the IEEE 802/ISO 8802 
        standards for CSMA/CD [LLC], although in this cased a SNAP 
        (subnetwork access protocol) header is also required for IP 
        packets). 
         
        The MPE encapsulation header does not directly include a type field 
        (e.g., to differentiate IPv4 and IPv6 packets).  If such support is 
        required, an option must be specified in the MPE encapsulation 
        header to indicate the addition of an LLC header, and this must be 
        followed by a SNAP header. This introduces additional overhead. 
         
        A Next Level Protocol Type field is also required if compression 
        (e.g. Robust Header Compression, ROHC) is supported. No compression 
        method has currently been defined that is directly applicable to 
        this framework, however the ROHC framework defines a number of 
        header compression techniques that may yield considerable 
        improvement in throughput on links which have a limited capacity. 
        Since many MPEG-2 transmission networks are wire-less (e.g., 
        satellite, terrestrial TV, line of sight microwave) the ROHC 
        framework will be directly applicable for many applications. Use of 
        ROHC implies the need to transfer smaller SNDUs and the need for 
        additional processing at the Receiver to expand the received 
        compressed packets. It is therefore recommended that the selected 
        type field contains sufficient code points for support of this 
        technique. 
         
        It is desirable therefore to include a Next Level Protocol Type 
        field in the encapsulation header.  Such a field should specify 
        values for at least IPv4, IPv6, and ROHC (e.g. [RFC3095]). It is 
        also desirable to allow for other values (e.g., MAC-level bridging). 
         
        5.1.4 L2 Subnet Addressing 
         
        In the MPEG-2 system the PID carried in the TS Packet header is used 
        to identify individual services with the help of SI tables. This was 
        primarily intended as a unidirectional (simplex) broadcast system. A 
        TS Packet stream carries either tables or one PES Packet stream 
        (i.e., compressed video or audio). Individual Receivers are not 
        addressable at this level. 
         
        IPv4 and IPv6 allocate addresses to end hosts and intermediate 
        systems (routers). Each system (or interface) is identified by a 
        globally assigned address.  ISO uses the concept of a hierarchically

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
        structured Network Service Access Point (NSAP) address to identify 
        an end user process in an Internet environment.  
         
        Within a local network a completely different set of addresses for 
        the Network Point of Attachment (NPA) is used; frequently these NPA 
        addresses are referred to as Medium Access Control, MAC-level 
        addresses. In the Internet they are also called hardware addresses. 
        Whereas network layer addresses are used for routing, NPA addresses 
        are primarily used for Receiver identification.  
         
        Receivers may use the NPA of a received SNDU to reject unwanted 
        unicast packets within the (software) interface driver at the 
        Receiver, but must also perform forwarding checks based on the IP 
        address. IP multicast and broadcast may also filter based using the 
        NPA, but Recievers must also filter unwanted packets at the network 
        layer based on source and destination IP addresses.  This does not 
        imply that each IP address must map to a unique NPA (more than one 
        IP address may map to the same NPA). If a separate NPA address is 
        not required, the IP address is sufficient for both functions.  
         
        If it is required to address an individual Receiver in an MPEG-2 
        transport system, this can be achieved either at the network level 
        (IP address) or via a hardware-level NPA address (MAC-address).  If 
        both addresses are being used, they must, be mapped either in a 
        static or a dynamic way (e.g., by an address resolution process), a 
        similar requirement may also exist to identify the PID and TS 
        multiplex on which services are carried.  
         
        Using an NPA address in a MPEG-2 transport system may enhance 
        security, in that a particular payload may be targeted for a 
        particular Receiver by specifying the Receiver NPA address. This is 
        however only a weak form of security, since the NPA filtering is 
        often reconfigurable (frequently performed in software), and may be 
        modified by a user to allow reception of specified (or all packets), 
        similar to promiscuous mode operation in Ethernet. If security is 
        required, it should be applied at another place (e.g. link 
        encryption, authentication of address resolution, IPSEC, transport 
        level security and/or application level security). 
         
        MPE defines a NPA destination address in the convergence header. No 
        NPA source address is present.  There are cases where an IP service 
        has no need for NPA addresses, in this case these add unnecessary 
        processing and transmission overhead, and should not be included in 
        the encapsulation header.   
         
        There are also cases where the use of a NPA is required (e.g. where 
        a system operates as a router) and if present this should be carried 
        in encapsulation header where it may be used by Receivers as a pre-
        filter to discard unwanted SNDUs. The addresses allocated do not 
        need to conform to the IEEE MAC address format, and there may 
        therefore be a good case for allowing the use of a reduced (smaller 
        than an IEEE MAC address) NPA. There are many cases where a NPA is

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
        not required, and network layer filtering may be used. A new 
        encapsulation protocol should therefore support an optional NPA and 
        may allow for future specification of the size of NPA. 
         
        5.1.5 Integrity Check 
         
        For the IP service, the probability of undetected packet error 
        should be  small (or negligible) [LINK-ID]. There is therefore a 
        need for a CRC to verify correctness of a received IP packet. Such 
        checks should be sufficient to detect incorrect operation of the 
        encapsulator and Receiver (including reassembly errors following 
        loss/corruption of TS Packets), in addition to protecting from loss 
        and/or corruption by the transmission network (e.g., multiplexors 
        and links). 
         
        Mechanisms exist in MPEG-2 transmission networks that may assist in 
        detecting loss (e.g. the 4-bit continuity counter included as 
        standard in the MPEG-2 TS Packet header).  
         
        A convergence protocol should use an encapsulation that provides a 
        strong integrity check. For ease of hardware implementation, this 
        check should be carried in a trailer following the SNDU. A CRC-32 is 
        sufficient for operation with up to a 12 KB payload, and may still 
        provide adequate protection for larger payloads. 
         
        5.1.6 Identification of Scope.  
         
        The MPE section header contains information that may be used by the 
        Receiver to identify the scope of the (MAC) address carried as a 
        NPA, and prevent TS Packets intended for one scope to be received by 
        another. 
                
        Similar functionality may be achieved by ensuring that only IP 
        packets that do not have overlapping scope are sent on the same TS 
        Logical Channel. In some cases, this may imply the use of multiple 
        TS Logical Channels. 
         
        5.1.7 Extensibility 
         
        The evolution of the Internet service may in future require 
        additional functions (examples include the introduction of new 
        protocols at the network level, support of 802.1Q tags). A flexible 
        protocol should therefore provide a way to introduce new features 
        when required, without having to provide additional out-of-band 
        configuration. 
         
        5.2 Header Overhead 
         
        The fixed 184 byte payload size of a TS Packet also introduces a 
        bandwidth overhead due to the "padding" (or stuffing) commonly 
        employed when placing data in the TS Packets.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
        One common application is the use of a DVB-S multiplex to provide 
        the forward link for satellite delivery of IP data.  In many current 
        applications the forward data traffic over the satellite link is 
        mostly data with a packet size 1500 bytes. This overhead is 
        approximately 2-11%. Short IP packets, (e.g., carrying control 
        information (e.g. ICMP, IGMP, and TCP ACK packets), can lead to a 
        much more overhead (up to approximately 500% for IPv4), if they are 
        carried individually in a TS Packet. IP header compression (e.g. 
        [RFC3095]), would offer no benefit in this case. 
         
        The "Payload_Unit_Start_Indicator" (PUSI) may be used to alleviate 
        this, by allowing the MPEG-2 payload pointer to indicate the 
        presence of a second payload unit within a single TS Packet. The 
        second payload unit may directly follow the end of the first, in a 
        procedure sometimes called "Packing". 
         
        Note, an under-run of data at the IP Encapsulator may cause a TS 
        Packet to be sent with less than 184 bytes of payload. Such a TS 
        Packet will need to be "padded".  
         
        5.3 TS Multiplexing 
      
        MPEG-2 multiplexers may forward TS Packets using a stream-based 
        design. They do not usually flush their buffers, but store TS 
        Packets until an input buffer fills to a threshold, (assuming that 
        the data arrives in a more or less continuous stream). This 
        assumption is not necessarily valid for IP packets, which tend to 
        arrive in intermittent traffic bursts.  The forwarding behaviour of 
        the multiplex can lead to significant link transit delays for the 
        last TS Packet(s) in a traffic burst. 
         
        Various solutions to this problem are possible including: 
        (i)    Flushing an IP packet stream with null TS Packets after each 
               traffic burst. 
        (ii)   Redesign of the TS multiplexer buffer management to control 
               the maximum queuing latency for IP traffic flows. 
        (iii)  Addition of a new push identifier that lets the TS  
               multiplexer identify the end of a traffic burst. 
         
        An Encapsulator could specify a maximum holding time (configured 
        based on well-known requirements, such as the TCP ACK_Delay 
        interval, but could also be based on QoS metric derived for the IP 
        traffic being carried). If required, the IP-DVB framework must 
        identify how this is to operate and specify appropriate values for 
        parameters. 
         
        5.4 Encapsulation Efficiency 
         
        In this section the following ranking is used to evaluate the 
        performance of different encapsulation methods: 
         
             Efficiency = Sum of transferred bytes / Payload size

        The overhead of 4 bytes for each 188 byte TS Packet introduced by 
        the MPEG-2 TS results in a maximum of 0.98.  
         
        In MPE, this overhead is increased by the DSM-CC private section 
        mechanism that generates at least 17 bytes per IPv4 packet (16 bytes 
        for the datagram section and 1 byte for the Payload Pointer field). 
        This excludes the LLC/SNAP field that is optional and not required 
        in all cases. Implementations supporting Packing may approach the 
        maximum performance for large SNDUs. 
         
        The volume of data transmitted for additional tables and descriptors 
        should be omitted because PSI information and system tables are 
        immanent to the MPEG2/DVB transmission scheme and have nothing to do 
        with actual data transmission.

     6. Address Resolution Functions 
         
        Address Resolution (AR) provides a mechanism that associates L2 
        information (including (NPA) address(es)) with the IP address of a 
        system. Many L2 technologies employ unicast AR at the sender: An IP 
        system wishing to send an IP packet encapsulates it and places it 
        into a L2 frame.  It then identifies the appropriate L3 adjacency 
        (next hop router, end-host) and determines the appropriate L2 
        adjacency (e.g. MAC address in Ethernet) to which the frame should 
        be sent so that the packet gets across the L2 link.  
         
        The L2 addresses discovered using AR are normally recorded in a data 
        structure known as the arp/neighbor cache. The results of previous 
        AR requests are usually cached. Further AR protocol exchanges may be 
        required as communication proceeds to control (update or re-
        initialise) the client cache state contents (i.e. purge/refresh the 
        contents [ND]). For stability, and to allow network topology changes 
        and client faults, the cache contents are normally "soft state", 
        that is, they are aged with respect to time and old entries removed. 
         
        In some cases (e.g. ATM, FR, X.25, MPEG-2 and many more), AR 
        involves finding more than the MAC address. This includes 
        identifying other parameters required for L2 transmission, such as 
        channel IDs (VCIs in ATM, or PIDs in MPEG-2 TS). 
         
        Address resolution has different purposes for unicast and multicast. 
        Multicast address resolution is not required for many L2 networks, 
        but is required for MPEG-2 transmission networks. 
         
      
     6.1 Address Resolution for MPEG-2 
      
        There are three elements to the L2 information required to perform 
        AR for a MPEG-2 TS. These are: 
         
        (i) A Receiver ID (e.g. a 6B MAC/NPA address). 
        (ii) A PID (Program IDentifier) or index to find a PID.  
        (iii) Tuner information (e.g. a Transport Stream ID) that maps to a 
        set of physical layer parameters. 
         
        Elements (ii) and (iii) need to be de-referenced via indexes to the 
        PMT when remultiplexors are used that may renumber the PID values, 
        (i.e. PIDs are not intended to be end-to-end identifiers). However, 
        although such use is common in broadcast TV networks, many private 
        networks do not need to employ multiplexors that renumber PIDs. 
         
        The third element (iii) allows an AR client to resolve to a 
        different MPEG TS Multiplex. This is used when there are several 
        channels that may be used for communication (i.e. multiple 
        outbound/inbound links). In a mesh system, this could be used to 
        determine connectivity.

        This AR information is used in two ways at a Receiver: 
         
        (i) AR resolves an IP unicast or IPv4 broadcast address to the (MPEG 
        TS Multiplex, PID, MAC/NPA address). This allows the Receiver to set 
        L2 filters to let traffic pass to the IP layer. This is used for 
        unicast, and IPv4 subnet broadcast. Usually this is configured with 
        the equivalent of an "ifconfig" on the interface. 
         
        (ii) AR resolves an IP multicast address to the (MPEG TS Multiplex, 
        PID, MAC/NPA address), and allows the Receiver to set L2 filters 
        enabling traffic pass to the IP layer. This operation may need to be 
        performed many times based on IGMP, MLD, and Multicast Routing 
        protocol operation. A Receiver in a MPEG-2 TS network needs to 
        resolve the PID value and tuning parameters associated with a TS 
        Logical Channel and (at least for unicast) the destination Receiver 
        NPA address.

        6.1.1 Example of AR in a Star Network 
         
        The example below shows a star topology MPEG-2 TS transmission 
        network, with two terminals receiving a forward broadcast channel 
        sent by a Hub.  (A mesh system has some additional cases.) The 
        forward broadcast channel consists of a "TS Multiplex" (a single 
        physical bearer) allowing communication with the terminals. These 
        communicate using a set of return channels.

           /       \  /

          |         +\                /-----\ 
           \       /  \              /       \ 
            \-----/    \            | Terminal| 
                        \-----------+    B    | 
                                     \       / 
                                      \-----/ 
         
        There are three possibilities for unicast AR: 
        (1) A system at a terminal, A, needs to resolve an address of a 
        system that is at the hub; 
         (2) A system at a terminal, A, needs to resolve an address that is 
        at another terminal, B; 
         (3) A host at the hub needs to resolve an address that is at a 
        terminal. The sender (encapsulation gateway), uses AR to provide the 
        (MPEG TS Multiplex, PID, MAC/NPA address) to be used to send 
        unicast, IPv4 subnet broadcast and multicast packets. 
         
        If the Hub is as an IP router, then case (1) and (2) are the same: 
        the host at the Receiver doesn't know the difference.  In these 
        cases, the address to be determined is the L2 address of the device 
        at the hub to which the IP packet should be forwarded, and which 
        then relays the IP packet back to the forward (broadcast) MPEG-2 
        channel after AR (case 3). 
         
        If the hub is a L2 bridge, then case 2 still has to relay the IP 
        packet back to the outbound MPEG-2 channel. The AR protocol needs to 
        resolve the specific Receiver L2 MAC address of B, but needs to send 
        this on a L2 channel to the Hub.  This requires terminals to be 
        informed of the L2 address of other terminals. 
         
        A host connected to the hub needs to use the AR protocol to resolve 
        the Receiver terminal MAC/NPA address. This requires the AR server 
        at the Hub to be informed of the L2 addresses of other terminals.

        6.2 The AR Process 
      
        Several features are desirable for AR over broadcast-style networks: 
         
        (i) A table based approach to promote AR scaling.  This requires a 
        definition of the frequency of update and volume of AR traffic 
        generated 
        (ii) Mechanisms to install AR information at the server (unsolicited 
        registration) 
        (iii) Mechanisms to verify AR information held at the server 
        (solicited responses). Appropriate timer values need to be defined. 
        (iv) An ability to purge client AR information (after IP network 
        renumbering, etc) 
        (v) Appropriate security associations to authenticate the parties. 
         
         
        6.3 Scenarios for MPEG AR 
         
        An AR protocol may transmit AR information in three distinct ways: 
         
        (i) An MPEG-2 signalling table transmitted at the MPEG-2 level 
        (ii) An MPEG-2 signalling table transmitted at the IP level (tbd, no 
        implantations of this are known) 
        (iii) An address resolution protocol transported over IP (as in ND) 
         
         
        There are three distinct scenarios in which AR may be used: 
         
        A. Multiple TS-Mux and the use of re-multiplexors; e.g. Digital 
        Terrestrial, Satellite TV broadcast multiplexes. Many such systems 
        employ remultiplexors that modify the PID values associated with TS 
        Logical Channels as they pass through the MPEG-2 transmission 
        network. 
          
        B. Tuner configuration(s) that are fixed or controlled by some other 
        process. In these systems, the PID value associated with a TS 
        Logical Channel may be known by the Sender. 
         
        C. A service run over one TS Mux (i.e., uses only one PID, for 
        example DOCSIS and some current DVB-RCS multicast systems). In these 
        systems, the PID value of a TS Logical Channel may be known by the 
        Sender. 
      
        6.3.1 Table-based AR over MPEG-2 
      
        Information about the set of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels carried over 
        a TS Multiplex is usually distributed via tables (service 
        information, SI) sent using channels assigned a specific (well-
        known) set of PIDs. This was originally designed for audio/video 
        distribution to set-top-boxes. The design requires access to and 
        processing of the SI table information (which is carried in MPEG-2 
        section format [ISO_DSMCC]). This scheme reflects the complexity of

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
        delivering and co-ordinating the various TS Logical Channels 
        associated with a multimedia TV programme.  
         
        One possible approach to provide TS multiplex and PID information 
        for IP services is to integrate additional information into the 
        existing MPEG-2 tables, or to define additional tables specific to 
        the IP service.  
         
        This process could be: 
         
        (i) A 2-stage process, specifically decoupling PID using a Transport 
        Stream ID (TS-ID).  This allows the transmission network to 
        remultiplex TS Logical Channels (resulting in a change of the PID 
        value associated with a TS Logical Channel). This is suited to 
        Scenario A.single stage where a target IP address resolves directly 
        providing full L2 information. 
         
        (ii) A 2-stage process, specifically the Receiver uses AR 
        information to establish the TS Logical Channel and a separate 
        process is used (when required) to resolve Receiver L2 addresses. 
         
        (iii) A one-stage process in which the tuning parameters and PID is 
        already known, or are resolved in the same process as used to 
        determine the NPA/MAC address. 
         
        The DVB INT and the A/92 Specification from ATSC [ATSC-A92] are 
        examples of (i). The DVB INT can associate an IP address with: 
        network_id, original_network_id, transport_stream_id, service_id and 
        component_tag. 
         
        - Network_id identifies the DVB network. 
        - Original_network_id and transport_stream_id together identify the 
        transport stream (globally, not only within the network. i.e. the 
        network_id is not actually needed, but it's there anyway). 
        - service_id identifies the PMT sub-table within the transport 
        stream. 
        - component_tag identifies the component within the PMT sub-table. 
        PMT announces PID for each component. 
         
        N.B. When a TS is re-mux'ed the remultiplexor doesn't update the 
        INT, but does modify the PMT for each of the PIDs it renumbers. 
         
        6.3.2 Table-based AR over IP 
         
        AR information could be carried over a TS data channel, (e.g. using 
        an IP protocol similar to the Service Announcement Protocol, SAP). 
        Implementing this independently of the SI tables, would ease 
        implementation, by allowing it to operate on systems where IP 
        processing is performed in a software driver. It may also allow the 
        technique to be more easily adapted to other similar delivery 
        networks. It also is advantageous for networks which use the MPEG-2 
        TS but links, but do not necessarily support audio/video services 
       
     Expires June 2003                                            [page 26] 
     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
        and therefore do not need to provide interoperability with TV 
        equipment (e.g. links used solely for connecting IP (sub)networks). 
         
        The AR function could be centralised in one or more (replicated) 
        databases (as in MARS) so a Receiver can do the address mapping with 
        AR information from a known place. There are both drawbacks and 
        advantages in this approach. To find an address, a Receiver sends a 
        query to a server/servers, who respond (proxy) for other known 
        Receivers. In the simple case, the server is pre-configured with the 
        bindings of all clients (e.g. tables created from a DHCP server when 
        it allocates IP addresses). 
         
        A variant of the above is when each Receiver sends an unsolicited 
        neighbor advertisement registering its L2 binding to the server. 
         
        6.3.3. Query/Response AR over IP 
         
        A query/response protocol may be used at the IP level (similar to, 
        or based on IPv6 Neighbor Advertisements of the ND protocol). The AR 
        protocol may operate over an MPEG-2 TS Logical Channel using a 
        previously agreed PID (e.g. configured, or communicated using a SI 
        table). In this case, the AR could be performed by the target system 
        itself (as in arp and nd). This has good soft-state properties, and 
        is very tolerant to failures. To find an address, a system sends a 
        "query" to the network, and the "target" replies. 
         
         
        6.4 Scoping 
         
        In some case, an MPEG-2 Transmission Network may support multiple IP 
        networks.  If this is the case, it is important to recognise the 
        context (scope) within which an address is resolved, to prevent 
        packets from one addressed scope leaking into other scopes. 
         
        Examples of overlapping IP address assignments, include: 
         
        (i)    Private unicast addresses (e.g. in IPv4, 10/8 prefix; 
               172.16/12 prefix; 192.168/16 prefix) should be confined to 
               one addressed area.  
         
        (ii)   Some multicast addresses, (e.g., the scoped multicast 
               addresses sometimes used in private networks). These are only 
               valid within an addressed area (examples for IPv4 include; 
               239/8; 224.0.0/24; 224.0.1/24). Similar cases exist for some 
               IPv6 multicast addresses. 
         
     (iii)   Scoped multicast addresses.  Forwarding of these addresses is 
     controlled by the scope associated with the address. 
      
        IP packets with these addresses must not be allowed to travel 
        outside their intended scope, and may cause unexpected behaviour if 
        allowed to do so.

     INTERNET DRAFT  Requirements for IP transport over DVB   December 2003 
      
      
         
        In addition, overlapping address assignments can arise using level 2 
        NPA addresses: 
         
        (i)    The NPA address must be unique within the TS Logical Channel. 
               IEEE MAC addresses used in Ethernet LANs are globally unique. 
               If the NPA addresses are not globally unique, the same NPA 
               address may be re-used by Receivers in different addressed 
               areas.  
         
        (ii)   The NPA broadcast address (all 1s MAC address). Traffic with 
               this address should be confined to one addressed area.  
      
        (iii)  Other non-IP protocols may also view sets of MAC multicast 
               addresses as link-local, and may produce unexpected results 
               if distributed across several private networks! 
      
        Reception of unicast packets destined for another addressed area may 
        lead to an increase in the rate of received packets by systems 
        connected via the network. IP end hosts normally filter received 
        unicast IP packets based on their assigned IP address. Reception of 
        The additional network traffic may contribute to processing load but 
        should not lead to unexpected protocol behaviour. It does however 
        introduce a potential Denial of Service (DoS) opportunity. 
         
        When the Receiver acts as an IP router, the receipt of such packet 
        may lead to unexpected protocol behaviour. This also provides a 
        security vulnerability since arbitrary packets may be passed to the 
        IP layer. 
         
        6.5 AR Authentication 
         
        In many AR designs authentication has been overlooked, because of 
        the wired nature of most existing IP networks, which makes it easy 
        to control hosts physically connected. With wireless connections, 
        this is changing: unauthorised hosts actually can claim L2 
        resources. The address resolution client (i.e. Receiver) may also 
        need to verify the integrity and authenticity of the AR information 
        it receives. There are similarities here with SEND [REF-to-SEND-
        WG]. There are trust relationships both ways - clients need to know 
        they have a valid server and that the resolution is valid. Servers 
        have a basic authorisation issue before they allow a L2 address to 
        be used. 
         
        The MPEG-2 transmission system may also require access control to 
        prevent unauthorised use of the satellite bearer, however, this is 
        an orthogonal issue to address resolution.

     7. Multicast Support 
         
        This section addresses specific issues concerning IPv4 and IPv6 
        multicast over MPEG-2 Transmission Networks. The primary goal of 
        multicast support will be efficient filtering of IP-multicast 
        packets by the Receiver, and the mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 multicast 
        addresses onto the associated PID value and TS Multiplex.  The 
        design should permit a large number of active multicast groups, and 
        should minimise the processing load at the Receiver when filtering 
        and forwarding IP multicast packets. For example, schemes that may 
        be easily implemented in hardware would be beneficial, since these 
        may relieve drivers and operating systems from discarding unwanted 
        multicast traffic. 
         
        These issues include, but are not restricted to: 
         
        (i)    Encapsulating multicast packets for transmission using a 
               MPEG-2 TS. 
        (ii)   Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS 
               Logical Channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
        (iii)  Provide signalling information to allow a Receiver to locate 
               an IP multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex. 
        (iv)   Determining group membership (e.g. utilising IGMP/MLD).  
        (v)    Error Reporting. 
         
        Multicast mechanisms are used at more than one protocol level. The 
        upstream MPEG-2 router may forward multicast traffic on the MPEG-2 
        TS link using a static or dynamic set of groups. When static 
        forwarding is used, the set of groups may also be configured or set 
        using SNMP, Telnet, etc. A Receiver normally uses either IGMP/MLD or 
        multicast routing to establish membership tables that it uses to 
        dynamically set local forwarding of received groups.  In a dynamic 
        case, this group membership information is fed-back to the Sender to 
        enable it to start sending new groups and (if required) to update 
        the tables that it produces for multicast AR. 
         
        Appropriate procedures need to identify the correct action when the 
        same multicast group is available on more than one TS Logical 
        Channel.  This could arise when different end hosts act as senders 
        to contribute IP packets with the same IP group destination address. 
        It may also arise when a sender duplicates the same IP group over 
        several TS Logical Channels (or even different TS Multiplexes), and 
        in this case a Receiver may potentially receive more than one copy 
        of the same packet. At the IP level, the host/router may be unaware 
        of this duplication.

        7.1 Multicast AR Functions 
         
        The functions required for multicast AR may be summarised as: 
         
        (i) The Sender needs to know L2 mapping of multicast group. 
        (ii) The Receiver needs to know L2 mapping of multicast group. 
         
        In the Internet, multicast AR is normally a mapping function rather 
        than a one-to-one association using a protocol. In Ethernet, the 
        sender maps an IP address to a L2 MAC address, and the Receiver uses 
        the same mapping to determine the L2 address to set a L2 
        hardware/software filter entry.  
         
        A typical sequence of actions for the dynamic case is: 
        L3) Populate the IP L3 membership tables at the Receiver. 
        L3) Receivers send/forward IP L3 membership tables to the Hub  
        L3) Dynamic/static forwarding at hub/upstream router of IP L3 groups 
        L2) Populate the IP AR tables at the encapsulator gateway  
                (i.e. Map IP L3 mcast groups to L2 (PIDs)) 
        L2) Distribute the AR information to Receivers 
        L2) Set Receiver L2 multicast filters for IP groups in the 
        membership table. 
         
        Multicast also introduces the concept of scoped addresses, requiring 
        appropriate scoping to be followed. To be flexible AR must associate 
        a Logical Channel (PID) not only with with a group, possibly a QoS 
        class, and other appropriate MPEG-2 TS attributes. Performing 
        multicast AR at the IP level can enable providers wishing to provide 
        independently scoped addresses would need to use multiple Multicast 
        AR servers, one per multicast domain.  Explicit per group AR to 
        individual L2 addresses is to be avoided.

        8. Examples of Usage 
         
        Consider the case where a hub server collects a table of AR 
        information. The collected AR information then needs to be 
        redistributed to clients using the forward multicast link. The 
        number of Receivers may range from 1 to many thousands.  
         
        8.1 Example 1 Example protocol stack for Sender Side (2 interface) 
      
        Consider a router with two logical interface (A,B) each to an IP 
        network which could use either private or global IP addresses.  If 
        AR is performed independently for each interface, the L2 addresses 
        used by subnetworks A,B may also overlap or be globally unique. A 
        separate association protocol could provide MPEG-2 other L2 
        information (MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels / PID mappings, etc) to the 
        IP systems in each of the connected IP networks. Both AR for L2 
        addresses and for association with TS logical channel attributes may 
        be performed by IP-level protocols using link-local IP multicast. A 
        good solution may also permit multiple servers. A simple association 
        protocol may only support networks that do not perform remux 
        renumbering of PIDs. When this needs to be supported, a L2 table 
        method may be used.

        For B to send to A, the encapsulation gateway at B needs to resolve 
        the IP address of A to the l2 address of X and identify that this 
        must be carried over (PID,TS) of p. 
         
        A already knows its L2 address is X, this doesn't need to be 
        communicated. It also knows or can determine it's layer 3 IP 
        address. It can not determine the  (pid,TS-ID) to use, so it must be 
        told p. Once it knows p it can tune and set the MPEG-2 demux filter. 
        The corresponding addresses for B are Y and q. 
         
        How do A and B find out X and Y? 
         
        1) X can be preassigned to A (e.g. A L2 address assigned by a 
        Receiver manufacturer), in which case, A has to tell the AR server 
        at B informing it that it will be using X (register). The AR server 
        at B could then inform other devices by sending an AR table that 
        includes an entry that says A uses X (mesh). The encapsulator needs 
        this information, and also other clients that need to send to A. 
          
        2) B can assign X to A. B informs A that it is using X. B could then 
        inform others by sending an AR table that includes an entry saying A 
        uses X (mesh) or that B uses Y as a proxy (star). 
         
        3) It is also possible that B does not know that A is using X. To 
        find this out, it may query the network/a third party AR server (Y) 
        looking for address A. A can then respond giving its resolved 
        address (X), which B then uses. The way in which Y is found is to be 
        determined (e.g. configured, or determined by a protocol mechanism).

        Assume a unicast (e.g. TCP) stream originates at a host, S, and is 
        intended for an end host, R. 
        The path between S and R includes an MPEG-2 link, with an 
        encapsulator B and a Receiver A. The Receiver, A, acts as a router. 
         
        The Encapsulator receives the IP packets from S and encapsulate them 
        with an SNDU destination address field of X, this is performed by 
        determining that A is not local to the subnetwork, but reached via 
        router with the IP Address A corresponding to the L2 value of X. The 
        packet is fragmented into TS-Packets and a PID assigned.

        This document proposes a framework for defining a set of protocols 
        to perform efficient and flexible support for IP network services 
        over networks built upon the MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS).   
         
        An informational document is recommended to document the existing 
        approaches, focussing on IP networking, the mechanisms that are used 
        and their applicability to supporting IP unicast and multicast 
        services.  This document is the first stage of this process. Import 
        areas include the interface between the IP network at the Sender and 
        Receiver and any protocols required.  Scenarios and use-cases need 
        to be proposed and studied, specifically this should include 
        detailing how IP-only MPEG-2 networks can be used as a link 
        technology in the general Internet. 
         
        The encapsulation to transfer IPv4 and IPv6 packets is described, 
        outlining current encapsulation methods, together with guidelines on 
        the requirements for developing a new encapsulation. All other 
        protocols in the framework will support IP packet transmission using 
        both the Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE), which is currently 
        widely implemented, and also any new optimised encapsulation.  
         
        The framework also includes MPEG-2 Address Resolution (AR) 
        procedures to allow dynamic configuration of the sender and Receiver 
        using an MPEG-2 transmission link/network.  These will support IPv4 
        and IPv6 services in both the unicast and multicast modes. 
         
        This proposed work is within scope of the ip-dvb WG and protocol 
        design could be done in this forum with the support and expertise of 
        other protocol design work. For this to be successful requires 
        inputs from the wider community and good liason with other 
        organisations. Comments are invited from implementers, operators, 
        and others interested people. 
      
      
     10. Security Considerations 
         
        The normal security issues relating to the use of wire-less links 
        for transport Internet traffic should be considered.

     [AUTHORS NOTES:XXX THIS SECTION MUST BE REMOVED BY THE RFC Ed] 
      
        Evaluation of IP Service over MPEG-2 networks 
         
        A set of methodologies may be defined to assist in the evaluation of 
        the protocols defined by this framework. These could define 
        terminology, evaluation criteria (utilisation, throughput, loss 
        rate, undetected error rate, etc), and may specify tests to indicate 
        the impact of such parameters as IP Packet size, IP version, 
        multicast/unicast, and rate of transmission.  A set of test cases 
        could also be defined to allow performance to be quantitatively 
        measured and compared. 
         
         
         
        Rationale for ULE Packing 
      
        Measurements of IPv4 traffic have shown that the overwhelming 
        majority of the datagrams have lengths of 1500 or 576 bytes for data 
        and 40 or 48 bytes for control traffic; for example, these values 
        represent almost 96% of the typical world-wide-web traffic.  
         
        The most frequent situations for the Encapsulator are: 
             -  a short control packet using only a fraction of the  
                TS Packet payload of 184 bytes; 
             -  a long data packet using a number of TS Packets with 
                the last containing only a remainder. 
                 
        Both of these lead to a fairly high overhead in the last TS Packet. 
        Since radio/satellite bandwidth is an expensive resource, as opposed 
        to bandwidth in wired LANs, a more efficient method is specified 
        here. One possibility is header compression, however this is outside 
        the scope of this document.

     Appendix A 
      
        The following principles are suggested for this work: 
         
        (i)    Ubiquity.  The framework operates below the IP network layer. 
               It must not require modifications to existing implementations 
               of IP (IPv4 or IPv6), UDP, TCP. 
         
        (ii)   Minimal overhead.  The framework should minimize protocol 
               overhead, in terms of the number of additional bytes to be 
               sent in addition to the IP packet and processing overhead in 
               terms of parsing effort of variable length headers or options 
               fields (see iv).  The number of header bytes can 
               significantly impact performance for bandwidth-limited 
               systems (such as satellite, terrestrial radio/TV links). 
         
        (iii)  Minimal set of required options.  Reducing the number and 
               type of optional parameters reduces the receiver processing 
               overhead.  Importantly, it also simplifies Receiver 
               implementation, allowing easier implementation and promoting 
               better interoperability between vendor implementations. The 
               header format currently adopted by MPE is known to be not 
               optimal for IP, incurring significant receiver processing 
               overhead and extra link overhead [CLC99]. 
         
        (iv)   Maximum Throughput. The framework should offer minimal 
               transmit/receive processing load. In some cases, the use of 
               header compression may represent a useful trade-off in 
               increased processing overhead, but reduced packet header 
               size. In some cases (e.g., to meet the QoS delay requirement 
               of a flow) efficiency at the MPEG-2 TS level may have to be 
               sacrificed for reduced transit delay.  
         
        (v)    Flexibility. The framework should provide sufficient 
               flexibility to allow future inclusion of other mechanisms for 
               specific applications (e.g., synchronisation with other MPEG-
               2 TS Logical Channels). There is also need for the framework 
               to operate over the range of MPEG-2 multiplexes in the 
               forward direction, and the diverse range of return channel 
               systems in the reverse direction. 
         
        (vi)   Compatibility. If new protocols are defined by the framework, 
               it is desirable that they allow co-existence with existing 
               schemes, such as MPE, to allow continued use of the broad-
               base of existing equipment. 
         
        (viii) Scalability. The framework must be efficient when used in 
               both large and small networks.  The size of a network using 
               MPEG-2 transport may range from a pair of nodes, to one 
               including millions of Receivers.
