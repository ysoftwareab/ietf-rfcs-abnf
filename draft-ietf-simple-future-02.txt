Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML
   format for presenting presence information for a presentity. The
   timed presence extension adds elements to PIDF that allow a
   presentity to declare their status for a time interval fully in the
   future or the past.

Internet-Draft               Timed Presence                    July 2004


1.  Introduction

   Presence information, e.g., represented as PIDF [3] and RPID [4],
   describes the current state of the presentity.  RPID also allows a
   presentity to indicate how long certain aspects of the status have
   been valid and how long they are expected to be valid, but the time
   range has to include the time when the presence information is
   published and delivered to the watcher. This restriction is necessary
   to avoid backwards-compatibility problems with plain PIDF
   implementations.

   In some cases, the watcher can better plan communications if it knows
   about the presentity's future plans.  For example, if a watcher knows
   that the presentity is about to travel, it might place a phone call
   earlier.

   It is also occasionally useful to represent past information since it
   may be the only known presence information; it may give watchers an
   indication of the current status.  For example, indicating that the
   presentity was at a meeting that ended an hour ago indicates that the
   presentity is likely in transit at the current time.

   Future or past status cannot be expressed with <status> elements that
   use optional attributes or elements indicating such past or future
   time ranges. If they did, PIDF parsers would ignore those optional
   attributes or elements, and would not be able to distinguish current
   information from past or future information.

   This document defines the <timed-status> element that describes the
   status of a presentity that is either no longer valid or covers some
   future timeperiod.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  Timed-Status Element

   The <timed-status> element MUST NOT appear as a child of a PIDF
   <status> element or another <timed-status> element.  More than one
   such element MAY appear within a PIDF <tuple> element.

   Sources of <timed-status> information should avoid overlapping
   elements, but since overlapping appointments are common in calendars,
   for example, receivers MUST be able to render such overlapping
   <timed-status> indications.

   The <timed-status> element MUST be qualified with the 'from'
   attribute and MAY be qualified with an 'until' attribute to describe
   the time when the status assumed this value and the time until which
   this element is expected to be valid.  If the 'until' attribute is
   missing, the information is assumed valid until the tuple is
   explicitly overridden or expires as defined by the publication
   mechanism used.  The time range MUST NOT encompass the present time,
   as that would provide an unnecessary and confusing alternate
   mechanism to describe presence. Thus, the 'from' attribute for tuples
   without an 'until' attribute MUST refer to the future.

   A presence agent (PA) MAY convert stored published <timed-status>
   tuples which are covering the present time when a notification is
   sent to regular PIDF tuples or it MAY simply discard them during the
   composition operation.

   The <timed-status> element may contain any PIDF element, <basic> and
   <note>, as well as status extensions, such as RPID [4].  However, not
   all elements in PIDF extensions are sensible in this context.  For
   example, information such as contact information [5] that does not
   change as a function of time is inappropriate for use with timed
   status.

   Note that this document chooses absolute rather than relative times,
   since relative times would be too hard to keep properly updated when
   spacing notifications, for example.  Implementations SHOULD ascertain
   whether the time values in the <timed-status> elements are plausible,
   for example, by checking whether the time stamp in a notification
   protocol message corresponds to local time and by making sure that
   they are fully in the past or future, both relative to real time and
   the time contained in the optional PIDF <timestamp> element.

     <tuple id="7c8dqui">
       <status>
         <basic>open</basic>
       </status>
       <ts:timed-status from="2003-08-15T10:20:00.000-05:00"
            until="2003-08-22T19:30:00.000-05:00">
            <basic>closed</basic>
       </ts:timed-status>
       <contact>sip:someone@example.com</contact>
     </tuple>
     <note>I'll be in Tokyo next week</note>
   </presence>
