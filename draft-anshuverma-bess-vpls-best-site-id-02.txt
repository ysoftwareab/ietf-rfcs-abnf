   Abstract

   With network-based applications becoming prevalent, solutions that
   provide connectivity over wide area become more attractive for
   customers. In small-to-medium enterprise sector, Virtual Private LAN
   Service (VPLS), is a very useful service provider offering. It
   creates an emulated LAN segments fully capable of learning and
   forwarding Ethernet MAC addresses.

   Today, in VPLS implementations, within the context of a VPLS PE (VE),
   a single-site is selected from which all PWs are rooted. The site-
   election mechanism is usually hard-coded by different vendors (e.g.
   minimum or maximum site-id), and as such, is outside end-users
   control. This offers no flexibility to end-users as it forces them to
   define the site-id allocation scheme well in advance, or deal with
   the consequences of a suboptimal site-id election. Moreover, whenever
   the elected site-id is declared down, the traffic to and from all
   other sites hosted within the same VE is impacted as well.

   pseudowires (PWs) established at all times, regardless of the events

1. Introduction


   As the popularity of VPLS services continue to expand, Service
   Provider requirements for a scalable multi-homed solution are
   becoming increasingly demanding. As dictated by RFC4762 BGP-VPLS RFC,
   every PE participating in a VPLS domain must be fully meshed through
   a bidirectional pseudowire (PW). This set of PWs is built attending
   to the signaling information (label-block) advertised by each PE. The
   label-block used to build any given PW, will be the one matching the
   local site being elected as 'representative' of the VPLS domain
   within a given PE. As stated in RFC4762, if this site is ever
   declared 'down', a compliant implementation will need to either
   withdraw the corresponding label-block, or announce that the affected
   site is no longer reachable. In either case, the PW will end up being
   destroyed, which will have a considerable impact on other local sites
   relying on this specific PW. Furthermore, as a considerable amount of
   cycles are spent in destroying/re-building affected PWs, the overall
   convergence period will be severely impacted for those critical
   multi-homed sites that need a rapid transition to a backup PE.





                                                               [Page 3]


Internet-Draft            VPLS Best-site ID                    May 2016


   This draft defines protocol extensions to keep core-facing
   pseudowires established at all times, regardless of the events
   taking place on the attachment-circuit segment when using the BGP-
   based signaling procedures defined in [RFC4761].

   Today, in VPLS implementations, within the context of a VPLS_PE (VE),
   a single-site is selected from which all PWs are rooted. The site-
   election mechanism is usually hard-coded by different vendors (e.g.
   minimum or maximum site-id), and as such, is outside end-users
   control. This offers no flexibility to end-users as it forces them to
   define the site-id allocation scheme well in advance, or deal with
   the consequences of a suboptimal site-id election. Moreover, whenever
   the elected site-id is declared down, the traffic to and from all
   other sites hosted within the same VE is impacted as well.

   In BGP VPLS MH scenarios the above pitfalls are specially acute, as
   not only we need to factor in the cost to bring the active PW down
   and run DF election in primary PE, but also in the n-DF PE and all
   remote-PEs within the VPLS domain. Taking into account that control-
   plane operation is signaled through BGP protocol, is fare to expect
   that many of these operations will be carried out in sequence and
   not in parallel, so the overall cost is usually pretty considerable
   in scaling scenarios.

   To achieve minimal traffic disruption, this draft introduces a
   virtual or dummy site which will serve as the preferable or best
   site within each VE. Thereby, its corresponding site-id value will
   be defined by the end-user. But more than providing greater
   provisioning flexibility, the real advantage of this best-site
   solution relies on the capability to maintain VPLS PWs established
   at all times regardless of the fluctuations in AC segments.

   To summarize, this best-site feature offers:

      * Greater provisioning flexibility.
      * Minimal traffic disruption for non-preferable sites in multi-
   site VEs (upon AC going down).
      * Convergence period would be considerably reduced in MH setups
   during transient intervals.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Modifications to Layer 2 Info Extended Community

   The Layer 2 Info Extended Community is used to signal control
   information of the pseudowires to be setup.  The extended community
   format is described in [RFC4761].  This draft recommends that the
   Control Flags field of this extended community be used to synchronize
   the best-site information amongst PEs for a given L2VPN.

         +------------------------------------+
         | Extended community type (2 octets) |
         +------------------------------------+
         |  Encaps Type (1 octet)             |
         +------------------------------------+
         |  Control Flags (1 octet)           |
         +------------------------------------+
         |  Layer-2 MTU (2 octet)             |
         +------------------------------------+
         |  Reserved (2 octets)               |
         +------------------------------------+

          Layer-2 Info Extended Community:


   Control Flags Bit Vector:

   This field contains bit flags relating to pseudowire's control
   information. It is augmented with the definition of one new flag
   field. If on a given PE VPLS instance is configured with 'best-
   site', it will include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer 2 Info Extended
   Community using Control Flags field with B = 1.






                                                               [Page 5]

   With reference to the Control Flags Bit Vector, the following bits in
   the Control Flags are defined; the remaining bits, MUST be set to
   zero when sending and MUST be ignored when receiving this Extended
   Community. The signaling procedure described here is therefore
   backwards compatible with existing implementations.

4. Best-site functionality:

   Traditionally, vpls path selection mechanism pick the minimum (or
   maximum) site-id to determine the 'preferable' local site. This
   'preferable' local site serves two purposes: 1) pseudowires created
   from the local VE will be rooted from this site, and 2) pseudowires
   created from remote VEs will be built towards this elected site.





                                                               [Page 6]


Internet-Draft            VPLS Best-site ID                    May 2016


   In order to provide some greater flexibility in the current pre-
   defined site-election process, this draft proposes a solution to give
   priority to these 'best-sites' in detriment of those local sites with
   minimum (maximum) site-ids.

   This solution would be fully backward compatible as VPLS-PEs on which
   the proposed feature isn't enable, would simply obviate the BGP
   extensions previously described, and thereby, would rely on their
   legacy/default site-election mechanism.

   Let's make use of the following example to describe our solution in
   more details:


                                ...............
                               .               .    ___ CE2
                         ___ PE1                .  /
                        /    :                  PE3
                     __/    :       Service      :
                 CE1 __     :       Provider     :
                       \     :                   :
                        \___ PE2                .
                               .               .
                                ...............

             Figure 1- MH scenario with Best-site capable nodes.


   A PE where 'best-site' feature is enabled in VPLS instance, behaves
   as a dummy site and no access interface will be associated with it.
   This dummy site won't be subjected to access interface down/up
   events; thereby, the corresponding D-bit will not be set to represent
   a site-down condition. The main goal here is to have a site that is
   permanently alive, regardless of the state of the attached circuits
   defined within the VPLS domain.


   Each VPLS instance where a 'best-site' is defined (e.g. PE1), will
   signal the site's existence by setting the B-bit of the control-
   flags bit-vector within the L2-info extended community. Upon arrival
   of this BGP advertisement to the receiving PE (e.g. PE3), and only
   if this one is 'best-site' capable, the received B-bit will be
   honored and the corresponding site will be elected as the most
   preferable site within the remote VE (PE1).


                                                               [Page 7]


Internet-Draft            VPLS Best-site ID                    May 2016



   For those neighbors where 'best-site' feature is not configured,
   conventional local site election will take place. For instance, if
   PE1 does not receive a Label-Block advertisement with B-bit set from
   a remote PE (PE3), it will assume that PE3 is not 'best-site'
   capable, and will create a pseudowire from its minimum (maximum)
   designated site. For the rest of the 'best-site' capable PEs, PE1
   will construct pseudowires rooted at its 'best-site' site.

   By proceeding to define a 'best-site' in each of the VEs across the
   VPLS network, we will be drastically reducing the DF transition
   period as no CPU cycles will need to be spent destroying and creating
   new pseudowires during failover events.



5. Remote mac-flush requirement:

   Having a permanent pseudowire setup would not be that effective if
   we end up relying solely on the current implicit mac-flush
   mechanism. MAC addresses are automatically aged out when the
   pseudowire over which they are learned is deleted. This approach
   would collide with the proposed 'best-site' feature, in which
   pseudowires are kept established on a permanent basis.

   An explicit-mac-flush capable implementation would ensure that MAC-
   to-pseudowire bindings are cleared the moment in which a DF
   transition is initiated. In scenarios where 'best-site' feature is
   enabled, no core-facing PW will be ever torn down, so previously
   learned MAC entries could potentially end up pointing to an invalid
   PW.

   Thereby, to avoid potential traffic blackholes, any successful
   'best-site' implementation should be capable of supporting the
   explicit-mac-flush mechanism depicted in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-
   multihoming draft]. F-bit was introduced in the Control-Flags 
   bit-vector, to provide a deterministic method in which any 
   given PE can request a remote PE to flush those mac-entries 
   learned from the former one.


   Control Flags Bit Vector



                                                               [Page 8]


Internet-Draft            VPLS Best-site ID                    May 2016



           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |D|A|F|B|Z|Z|C|S| (Z = MUST Be Zero)
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   When making use of this feature, a DF PE will set the 'F' bit,
   whereas an n-DF one will clear it when sending BGP MH
   advertisements. A state transition from one to zero for the 'F' bit,
   will be interpreted by a remote PE as an indication to flush all the
   MACs learned from the PE that is transitioning from DF to n-DF.


6. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing [RFC4271].



7. IANA Considerations
