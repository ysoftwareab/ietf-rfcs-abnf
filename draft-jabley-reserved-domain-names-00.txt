Abstract

   The Domain Name System (DNS) makes use of a hierarchical naming
   scheme.  The validity of a particular name in the DNS is governed by
   protocol, operational and policy considerations.

   The IETF has identified particular domain names to have special
   considerations associated with their use.  These domain names have
   been identified in various documents in the RFC series.  This
   document describes the creation of an IANA registry to catalogue such
   domain names and provides direction about how this registry should be
   maintained.

   This document does not identify any new domain name as having special
   considerations associated with its use.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].

   The DNS makes use of a hierarchical naming scheme.  The validity of a
   particular name in the DNS is governed by protocol, operational and
   policy considerations.

   The IETF has identified particular domain names to have special
   considerations associated with their use.  Examples of such domain
   names are "LOCALHOST" and "EXAMPLE.ORG" which are discussed in
   [RFC2606], and "LOCAL" and "254.169.IN-ADDR.ARPA" which are described
   in [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns].

   This document describes the creation of an IANA registry to catalogue
   such domain names and provides direction about how this registry
   should be maintained.

   This document does not identify any new domain name as having special
   considerations associated with its use.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document directs the IANA to create a registry as follows:

    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Parameter               | Value                                |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Registry Name           | Reserved Domain Names                |
    |                         |                                      |
    | Reference               | This document (RFCXXXX)              |

    | Registration Procedures | Document Published with IAB Approval |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------+

   The initial registry contents should be as follows:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+

   | LOCALHOST   | Traditionally statically defined in     | [RFC2606] |
   |             | host DNS implementations as having an A |           |
   |             | record pointing to the loop back IP     |           |
   |             | address, and reserved for such use      |           |
   |             |                                         |           |
