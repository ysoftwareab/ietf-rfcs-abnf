                The Use of Non-ASCII Characters in RFCs
                       draft-flanagan-nonascii-02

Abstract

   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
   diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for
   the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the
   accepted language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be
   in UTF-8.  This document describes the RFC Editor requirements and
   guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.

   This document updates the RFC Style Guide [I-D.iab-styleguide].
