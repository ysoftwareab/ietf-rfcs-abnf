 RSVP-TE extensions for dynamic hostname traversing OSPF routing areas
             draft-zheng-ccamp-rsvp-te-dynamic-hostname-00

Abstract

   RFC 5642 defines an OSPF Router Information TLV that allows OSPF
   Routers to flood their hostname-to-Router-ID mapping information.
   Sometimes, when the operators create an inter-area MPLS LSP tunnel
   with Resource ReSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE),
   they need the hostname display on the CLI at the ingress node for
   management and operational reasons.  This document describes
   extensions to RSVP-TE to support hostname-to-Router-ID mapping
   information traversing areas in an inter-area MPLS LSP tunnel
   situation.

Internet-Draft          RSVP-TE dynamic hostname           February 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5642 defines an OSPF Router Information TLV that allows OSPF
   Routers to flood their hostname-to-Router-ID mapping information.
   The flooding scope of the Dynamic Hostname TLV is controlled by the
   Opaque LSA type.  Because of the constraint of the OSPF LSA flooding
   scope, routers in an area cannot get the hostname-to-Router-ID
   mapping information of the routers other than ASBRs in another area.

   Sometimes, when the operators create an inter-area MPLS LSP tunnel
   with RSVP-TE, they need the hostname display on the CLI at the
   ingress node for management and operational reasons.  However, as
   mentioned above, the ingress node may not have the hostname-to-
   Router-ID mapping information of the other nodes in the MPLS LSP
   tunnel.

   This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support hostname-to-
   Router-ID mapping information traversing OSPF areas in an inter-area
   MPLS LSP tunnel situation.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Implementation

   These extensions make use of the Notify message described in
   [RFC3473], by defining a new Dynamic Hostname Object.  These
   extensions are OPTIONAL.  In this implementation, Record Route Object
   MUST be contained in both Path and Resv message.

   Dynamic Hostname Object is defined for the Notify message described
   in [RFC3473], to carry the hostname-to-Router-ID mapping information.
   The Class-Num needs to be assigned by the IANA.  The suggested C-type
   is 1.

   -  Subobjects: The contents of a Dynamic Hostname object are a series
      of variable-length data items called subobjects.  The subobjects
      are defined below.

2.2.  Procedures

   The node as Area Border Routers in OSPF routing area, can gain the
   hostname-to-Router-ID mapping information of the nodes in their
   attached areas, as described in [RFC 5642].  Thus, ABR can be used to
   generate Notify messages with Dynamic Hostname Object containing the
   hostname-to-Router-ID mapping information of the nodes in any area it
   attaches.  The nodes other than ABR in the LSP tunnel, would never
   generate Notify messages with Dynamic Hostname Object.

   An ABR in the LSP tunnel receives a Resv message from downstream, and
   could know from the Record Route Object which nodes of the LSP tunnel
   are in the same area that the interface of the ABR received Resv
   message belongs to.  Then the ABR generates the Notify messages to
   ingress node carrying the Dynamic Hostname Object with the hostname-
   to-Router-ID mapping information of those nodes, which can be
   obtained from its local mapping table.

   The ingress node will have the hostname-to-Router-ID mapping
   information of all nodes in the LSP tunnel, as it has obtained the
   mapping information of the nodes in other areas from the Notify
   messages sending by the ABRs.

   If the mapping information of a node in another area changed, the
   ingress node MUST be notified immediately by the corresponding ABR
   using Notify message only containing the changed mapping information.
