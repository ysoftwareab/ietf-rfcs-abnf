Abstract

   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This
   document has been defined to provide the a definition of a common
   format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information
   across the Internet.

   This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type per
   [RFC1521]. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable for
   use outside of a MIME message content type.

        [Editor NOTE: This form will be changed to reflect the new MIME
        memos in the next draft.]

   The proposed media type value is "TEXT/CALENDAR". This string would
   label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
   encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.

   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event and to-do information. It also can be used to convey
   free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME
   message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems

   or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object
   for interactions between desktop applications using the operating
   system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

   This document is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar
   specification for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling
   information. In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work,
   this document is to be known as the iCalendar specification.

   This document also includes the format for defining content type
   profiles. A content type profile is a document that defines a set of
   usage constraints for the iCalendar Object. For example, a profile
   might be defined to specify how the iCalendar Object can be used to
   provide for a set of interpersonal scheduling messages. Such a
   profile might define scheduling messages that request an event be
   scheduled, reply to an event request, send a cancellation notice for
   an event, modify or replace the definition of an event, provide a
   counter proposal for an original event request, delegate an event
   request to another individual, request free or busy time, reply to a
   free or busy time request, or provide similar scheduling messages for
   a to-do calendar component.

1.      Introduction

   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology. However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these groupware applications. This specification is intended to
   progress the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar
   calendaring and scheduling applications. This specification defines a
   MIME content type for exchanging electronic calendaring and
   scheduling information. The Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core
   Object Specification, or iCalendar Object, allows for the capture and
   exchange of information normally stored within a calendaring and
   scheduling application; such as a Personal Information Manager or a
   Group Scheduling product.

   The format is suitable as an exchange format between applications or
   systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME content type. This
   will enable the object to be exchanged using several transports,
   including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file system, desktop
   interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-based clipboard or
   drag/drop interactions, point-to-point asynchronous communication,
   wired-network transport, or some form of unwired transport such as
   infrared might also be used.

   The specification also provides for the definition of usage profiles
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments and to-dos. The


Dawson/Stenerson                   4                Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   usage profiles can be used to define other calendaring and scheduling
   operations such a requesting for and replying with free/busy time
   data.

   The specification also includes a formal grammar for the content type
   to aid in the implementation of parsers and to serve as the
   definitive reference when ambiguities or questions arise in
   interpreting the descriptive prose definition of the specification.

1.1     Definitions

   Date and time terminology is used in every day conversations.
   However, there are precise definitions of many of these terms that
   are used by this memo.

1.1.1   Calendar Scale

   The particular type of calendar in general use. For example,
   Gregorian, Buddhist Era, Japanese Emperor Era, Chinese Lunar,
   Islamic, and Jewish Calendars.

1.1.2   Coordinate Universal Time (UTC)

   The time scale maintained by the Bureau International de l'Heure
   (International Time Bureau) that forms the basis of a coordinated
   dissemination of standard frequencies and time signals. UTC is often
   incorrectly referred to as GMT.

1.1.3   Daylight Saving Time (DST)

   An adjustment to local to accommodate annual changes in the number of
   daylight hours. DST is also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or
   Legal Time. Daylight saving time adjustments in the southern
   hemisphere are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere.

1.1.4   Gregorian Calendar

   A calendar scale in general use beginning in 1582. It was introduced
   to correct an error in the Julian Calendar scale. The Gregorian
   Calendar scale is based on a solar calendar consisting of common
   years made up of 365 days and leap years made up of 366 days; both
   divided into 12 sequential months.

   Initially, this memo addresses specification of calendar information
   in terms of the Gregorian calendar scale.

1.1.5   Local Time

   The clock time in public use in a locale. Local time is often
   referenced by the customary name for the time zone in which it is
   located. The relationship between local time and UTC is based on the
   offset(s) that are in use for a particular time zone. In general, the
   formula is as follows:



Dawson/Stenerson                   5                Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


        local time = UTC + (offset)

1.1.6   Standard Time

   Introduced by Sir Sanford Fleming and others around 1870, standard
   time is a scheme for dividing the world into zones where the same
   time would be kept. The original proposal was to divide the world
   into 24 zones, each zone having a width of 15 degrees of longitude.
   The center zone was originally the meridian passing through
   Greenwich, England, called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The time in the
   zones was decremented by one hour per zone going westwards and was
   incremented by one hour per zone going eastwards from GMT. Changes
   have been made to the original proposal to accommodate political
   boundaries. In addition, some countries and regions specify 30 or 45
   minute offsets, rather than the full 60 minute offset. Standard time
   is also known as Winter Time in some regions.

   GMT and UTC are generally equivalent. However, by international
   agreement, the GMT term is discouraged in favor of the term UTC for
   all general time keeping.

1.1.7   Time Zone

   The particular time zone that a location's time is expressed in. A
   time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time measurement
   rules determined by the governing body for the given location. These
   rules describe at a minimum the base offset from UTC, often referred
   to as the Standard Time offset. Optionally, if Daylight time is
   observed, the rules will specify the Daylight time offset and either
   a set of rules describing the transition to and from Daylight time or
   absolute dates describing the movement in and out of Daylight time.
   It is important to note that these rules are not static. Time zones
   may also have a local customary name. However, not all time zones
   have a special name for their time. The customary names for time
   zones are often abbreviated. However, not all time zone abbreviations
   are unique. For example, AST may mean Atlantic Standard Time, Alaska
   Standard Time, and event Aleutian Standard Time. Each of these are
   different offsets from UTC. Nevertheless, customary names for time
   zones are in use in various parts of the world.

     Security considerations: The calendaring and scheduling information
     based on this MIME content type may include references to Uniform
     Resource Locators that may be programmed resources. In addition,
     this information may contain direct references to executable
     programs intended to be used as program-based alarms for an event
     or to-do. Implementers and users of this specification should be
     aware of the network security implications of accepting and parsing
     such information.

     Interoperability considerations: This MIME content type is intended
     to provide interoperability between calendaring and scheduling
     products. It is heavily based on the earlier [VCAL] industry
     specification.

        changed to reflect the revision to the MIME memos when the
        respective RFC becomes available.]

   This memo is meant to serve as the basis for registration of a MIME
   content type per [RFC1521]. It is defined using the MIME content type
   registration from [MIME-REG]. The proposed content type value is
   "TEXT/CALENDAR". This string would label a media type containing


Dawson/Stenerson                   7                Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   calendaring and scheduling information encoded primarily as text
   characters formatted in a manner outlined below. The media type is
   useful for conveying inter-personal calendaring and scheduling
   information between systems and applications.

   A subtype of the standard MIME _TEXT_ media type was chosen as the
   form for this content type because it provides a known and reasonable
   fallback for legacy systems that are required in an enterprise that
   also includes MIME based user agents that support this content type.
   Legacy systems that do not understand the _TEXT/CALENDAR_ content
   type will render these MIME entities as they would _TEXT/PLAIN_
   content type. This will provide a minimal level of support for
   calendaring and scheduling information in legacy systems (i.e., the
   ability to display the text tagged calendaring and scheduling content
   information). This is a vital requirement for any mail enabled,
   enterprise application; as there are still over 7 million existing
   legacy electronic mail user agents at this time.

   The calendaring and scheduling media type is specified as an
   independent content type in order that it can be conveyed either as a
   single MIME message entity or as one MIME entity in a multi-part MIME
   message. Additionally, the calendaring and scheduling information may
   be defined in a multi-part message containing references to other
   MIME body parts holding additional data related to the event, to-do,
   or free/busy time information.

3.1     Published specification

   The following characteristics are specific to this MIME content type.

3.1.1   Existing Message Header Fields

   The MIME Calendar Content Type may utilize any of the message header
   fields defined by [RFC 822], [RFC 2045], and [RFC 1766]. A number of
   these message header fields are especially useful to the iCalendar
   Object. These include the following header fields defined in either
   [RFC 822], [RFC 2045], and [RFC 1766].

3.1.1.1 Content-Type Header Field

   The [RFC 2045] Content-Type header field is used to identify the
   iCalendar Object. The value of this property must be _text/calendar_
   in order to correspond to the media type defined by this document.
   This header field is required for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type.

3.1.1.1.1       CHARSET Header Field Parameter

   The [RFC 2045] CHARSET Content-Type header field parameter is used to
   identify an alternate character set to the default US-ASCII used by
   the iCalendar Object. This header field parameter is optional for
   MIME entities conforming to this content type.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


3.1.1.2 Content-ID Header Field

   The [RFC 2045] Content-ID header field is used by the iCalendar
   Object to provide a persistent, globally unique identifier for a MIME
   Calendar Object within a MIME message entity. This header field is
   required for multi-part MIME entities containing an iCalendar Object
   that conforms to this content type. In the event that the iCalendar
   Object is transported in a MIME message containing a single body,
   then the Message-ID header field is required.

3.1.1.3 Content-Language

   The [RFC 1766] Content-Language header field is used to provide an
   alternate default language for the MIME Calendar Object. The default
   language is _en-US_. This header field is optional for MIME entities
   conforming to this content type.

3.1.1.4 Message-ID Header Field

   The [RFC 2045] Message-ID header field is used by the iCalendar
   Object to provide a persistent, globally unique identifier for a MIME
   message containing a single body part consisting of a iCalendar
   Object. This header field is required for a single body part MIME
   message conforming to this content type. In the event that the
   iCalendar Object is transported as a body part within a multi-part
   MIME message, the Content-ID header field must be specified. The
   Message-ID header field is used to unambiguously refer to the
   iCalendar Object within a MIME entity.

3.1.1.5 Transfer-Encoding Header Field

   The [RFC 2045] Transfer-Encoding header field is used to provide an
   alternate transfer encoding for the iCalendar Object. The default
   transfer encoding is _7BIT_. This header field is required for a MIME
   entity conforming to this content type when any other encoding is
   used in the iCalendar Object.

3.1.2   Additional Content Type Parameter

   In addition to the existing content type parameters defined by [RFC
   2045] and [RFC 1766], this document defines an additional content
   type parameter to be used by the iCalendar Object.

3.1.2.1 Profile

   The MIME Calendar Object defines the Profile content type parameter.
   This parameter is used to specify a usage profile for the iCalendar
   Object. The value of this parameter consists of a type and a subtype
   value pair. The type value is used to specify either a EVENT, TODO,
   or FREE-BUSY type of MIME Calendar Object profile. The subtype value
   is used to specify the scheduling operation being conveyed by the
   profile type. For example, the EVENT and TODO type values might have
   a subtype value of REQUEST, to convey an event or to-do request
   message, REPLY, to convey an event or to-do reply message, MODIFY, to


Dawson/Stenerson                   9                Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   convey an event or to-do modification message, CANCEL, to convey an
   event or to-do cancellation message, DELEGATE, to convey an event or
   to-do delegation message; or the BUSYFREE type value might have a
   subtype value of REQUEST, to convey a free-busy time request message
   , or REPLY, to convey a free-busy time data message. The parameter
   value is defined by the following BNF:

     profile := ((_EVENT_ / _    _)                              TODO   _-_ type1) / (_FREEBUSY_ _-_ type2)

     type1 :=   <any IANA values defined by an iCalendar Object usage
     profile or an _X-_ type of non-standard value>

     type2 :=   <any IANA value defined by an iCalendar Object usage
     profile or an _X-_ type of non-standard value>

   The following is an example of this content type parameter for a
   profile that specifies an event request message, such as in a request
   for a meeting or appointment:

     CONTENT-TYPE:TEXT/CALENDAR;PROFILE=EVENT-REQUEST

   The following is an example of this content type parameter for a
   profile that specifies a to-do delegation message, such as delegating
   a task to another individual:

     CONTENT-TYPE:TEXT/CALENDAR;PROFILE=TODO-DELEGATE

   The following is an example of this content type parameter for a
   profile that specifies a free-busy time request, such as when
   searching for a free time for a meeting:

     CONTENT-TYPE:TEXT/CALENDAR;PROFILE=FREEBUSY-REQUEST

   This content type parameter is required for MIME entities conforming
   to this content type. Other memos are expected to address specific
   usage profiles and define values for this property.

3.1.3   Content Syntax Considerations

   The following general considerations are specific to the syntax used
   to format the text of the body information for this content type.

3.1.3.1 Property

   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing an
   event or a to-do associated with the MIME Calendar Object. A property
   takes the following form:

     property :=        propname *(_;_ propparm) _:_ propvalue

   as shown in the following example:

     DTSTART:19960415T083000-05:00

   A property takes the form of one or more lines of text. The
   specification of property names and property parameters is case
   insensitive. The property name can be one of a set of pre-defined or
   non-standard strings. The property name must appear as the first
   characters on a line. In the previous example, _DTSTART_ is the name
   of the Start Date/Time property. Property values are specified as
   strings. In the previous example, _19960415T083000-05:00_ is the
   formatted value for the Start Date/Time property.

   The property parameter expressions are specified as either a
   name=value or a value string. The parameter value string can be
   specified alone in those cases where the value is unambiguous. For
   example a complete property parameter specification might be:

     DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Don't forget to order Girl=
      Scout cookies from Stacey today!

   A valid short version of the same property parameter specification
   might be:

     DESCRIPTION;QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Don't forget to order Girl=
      Scout cookies from Stacey today!

3.1.3.2 Delimiters

   Individual lines within the iCalendar Object body are delimited by
   the [RFC 822] line break, which is a CRLF sequence (ASCII decimal 13,
   followed by ASCII decimal 10). Long lines of text can be split into a
   multiple-line representation using the RFC 822 _folding_ technique.
   That is, wherever there may be linear white space (NOT simply LWSP-
   chars), a CRLF immediately followed by at least one LWSP-char may
   instead be inserted. For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description
       that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
   of a property definition to its single line representation is called
   _unfolding_. Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately
   followed by a LWSP-char as equivalent to the LWSP-char.

   It is recommended that folding be limited to higher-level syntactic
   breaks in structured components of the property definition.

   A formatted text line break in a property value, must also be
   specified by a (RFC 822) line break, which is a CRLF sequence.
   However, since the CRLF sequence is used to delimit a line, property
   values with formatted line breaks (i.e., multiple lines) must be
   encoded using an alternate encoding of either Quoted-Printable or
   Base64, as defined in [RFC 2045].

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   For example, in the Quoted-Printable encoding the multiple lines of
   formatted text are separated with a Quoted-Printable CRLF sequence of
   _=0D_ followed by _=0A_ followed by a Quoted-Printable soft line
   break sequence of _=_. Quoted-Printable lines of text must also be
   limited to less than 76 characters. The 76 characters does not
   include the CRLF [RFC 822] line break sequence. For example a
   multiple line DESCRIPTION value of:

     Project XYZ Final Review
     Conference Room - 3B
     Come Prepared.

   Would be represented in a Quoted-Printable encoding as:

     DESCRIPTION; QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Project XYZ Final Review=0D=0A=
     Conference Room - 3B=0D=0A=
     Come Prepared.

   Property parameter sub-strings are delimited by a field delimiter,
   specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-
   colon character in a property parameter value must be escaped with a
   Backslash character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Compound property values are delimited by a field delimiter,
   specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-
   colon character in a component of a compound property value must be
   escaped with a Backslash character (ASCII decimal 92).

3.1.3.3 Property Value Transfer Encoding

   The default transfer encoding for the iCalendar Object is _7BIT_. The
   default transfer encoding can be overridden for an individual
   property value by using the _ENCODING_ property parameter. This
   parameter value can be either _7BIT_, _BASE64_, _QUOTED-PRINTABLE_,
   or _8BIT_. This parameter may be used on any property.

   The MIME TRANSFER-ENCODING header field can be used to specify a
   default transfer encoding other than 7BIT (e.g., 8BIT).

3.1.3.4 Property Value Character Set

   The default character set for a iCalendar Object is ASCII. The
   default character set can be overridden for an individual property
   value by using the _CHARSET_ property parameter. This property
   parameter may be used on any property. However, the use of this
   parameter on some properties may not make sense.

   Any character set registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) can be specified by this property parameter. For
   example, ISO 8859-8 or the Latin/Hebrew character set is specified
   by:

     DESCRIPTION;CHARSET=ISO-8859-8:...

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   The MIME CHARSET parameter on the CONTENT-TYPE header field can be
   used to specify a default character set other than ASCII (e.g., UTF-
   8).

3.1.3.5 Property Value Language

   The default language for a iCalendar Object is _en-US_ (US English).
   The default language can be overridden for an individual property
   value by using the _LANGUAGE_ property parameter. The values for this
   property are a string consistent with RFC 1766, Tags for the
   Identification of Languages. This property parameter may be used on
   any property. However, the use of this parameter on some properties,
   such as PHOTO, LOGO, SOUND, TEL, may not make sense. Canadian French
   would be specified by this property parameter by the following:

     SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=fr-CA:...

   The MIME LANGUAGE parameter on the CONTENT-TYPE header field can be
   used to specify a default language other than US English (e.g., fr-
   CA).

3.1.3.6 Property Value Data Type

   In order to more fully specify the semantics of this content type and
   to facilitate its automated processing, the specification of each
   property defined by the iCalendar Object identifies the valid data
   types and the default data type for the property value. In addition,
   within an instance of this content type a property may explicitly
   convey the data type information through the DATATYPE property
   parameter. The STRING data type for the DESCRIPTION property would be
   specified by the following:

     DESCRIPTION;DATATYPE=STRING:Weekly Staff Meeting

   If the DATATYPE property parameter is not specified on a property,
   then the default data type for that property is assumed. Usage
   profiles for this content type that introduce new properties must
   specify the default data type for each newly defined property. The
   data types used within this content type definition include the
   following:

   combinations of dates and times. Either the basic or extended format
   is allowed. The use of UTC, rather than local time, should be used
   when ever possible in order to avoid time zone ambiguities. Where
   local time is specified, the inclusion of the UTC offset should also
   be included to avoid time zone ambiguities. The format for the
   complete, representation of a date and time value is represented by
   the following ABNF:

     date-time =        (date / time / (date _T_ time))


     date =     year month day
     year =     <four digits representing the century and year>
     month =    [_-_] <digits representing the month in the year>
     day =      [_-_] <digits representing the day of the month>

     time =     hour minute second [fraction](utc-sign / utc-offset)
     hour =     <digits representing a period of time of 60 minutes>
     minute =   [_:_] <digits representing a period of time of 60
                seconds>
     second =   [_:_] <digits representing a basic measurement unit
                of time in the International System of Units as defined
                in ISO 31-1>
     fraction = _,_ <digits representing fraction of a second>
     utc-sign = _Z_
     utc-offset = [_+_ / _-_] hour [_:_] minute
        ;_+_ if offset is after UTC and _-_ if offset is before UTC

   The basic complete representation does not include the _-_ date
   separator nor the _:_ time separator. The extended complete
   representation does include the separators.

   For example, 8:30 AM on April 15, 1996 local time EST would be
   written as:

     19960415T083000-05:00

   And the same time in UTC based time would be written as:

     19960415T133000Z

   The same date and time represented in the extended completed
   representation would be written as:

     1996-04-15T08:30:00-05:00

   And the same time in UTC based time would be written as:

     1996-04-15T13:30:00Z

   Where a value needs to specify a sequence of date and time values,
   then the property value is a string made up of a list of date and
   time values, separated by the field separator, a Semi-Colon (ASCII
   decimal 59). For example:

3.1.3.8 Time Duration

   The values for time duration or periods of time for all iCalendar
   Object properties are formatted as a string consistent with the ISO
   8601 representation for duration of time. A given duration of a
   period of time is represented by a character string consisting of the
   designator _P_, optionally including the number of years followed by
   the designator _Y_, optionally including the number of months
   followed by the designator _M_, optionally including the number of
   weeks followed by the designator _W_, optionally including the number
   of days followed by the designator _D_. The sequence can also contain
   a time component preceded by the designator _T_, optionally including
   the number of hours followed by the designator _H_, optionally
   including the number of minutes followed by the designator _M_,
   optionally including the number of seconds followed by the designator
   _S_. The following ABNF describes the representation of ISO 8601
   periods of time:

     duration = _P_ (yr-period / tm-period / (yr-period tm-period))
        ;Duration needs to include at least one component of year or
        ;time periods

     yr-period =        [yr-parm] [mo-parm] / wk-parm
     yr-parm =          _Y_ <digits representing the number of years>
     mo-parm =          _M_ <digits representing the number of months>
     wk-parm =          _W_ <digits representing the number of weeks>

     tm-period =        _T_ [hr-parm] [mn-parm] [sc-parm]
     hr-parm =          _H_ <digits representing the number of hours>
     mn-parm =          _M_ <digits representing the number of minutes>
     sc-parm =          _S_ <digits representing the number of seconds>

   For example:

     P6W

   represents a period of six weeks;

     PT15M

   represents a period of 15 minutes;

     PT1H30M

   represents a period of 1 hour and thirty minutes; or

     P2Y10M15DT10H30M20S

   represents a period of 2 years, 10 months, 15 days, 10 hours, 30
   minutes, and 20 seconds.

3.1.3.9 Value Location

   The default location of the property values is inline with the
   property. However, for some properties, such as those that specify
   multimedia values, it is more efficient in a MIME message to organize
   the property value as a separate MIME entity. The property parameter
   _VALUE_ can be specified to override the _INLINE_ location of the
   property value. In the case of the iCalendar Object being transported
   within a MIME email message, the property value can be specified as
   being located in a separate MIME entity with the _CONTENT-ID_ value;
   or _CID_ for shorthand. In this case, the property value is the
   Content-ID for the MIME entity within the multi-part message that
   contains the property value. The value can also be specified as being
   contained within an another, external message using the _MESSAGE-ID_
   value, or _MID_ for shorthand. In addition, the property value can be
   specified as being located out on the Internet using the _URL_ value.
   In this case, the property value is the Uniform Resource Locator for
   the Internet resource containing the property value. This property
   parameter may be used on any property. However, the use of this
   parameter on some properties may not make sense; for example the
   Version, Time Zone, Status, Priority, Mail Reminder, etc. properties.

   The following specifies a value located out on the Internet:

     ATTACH;VALUE=URL:http://www.abc.com/dir_photos/my_photo.gif

   The following specifies a value located out in the content of another
   message:

     ATTACH;VALUE=MID:<960120.aaCB@host1.com>

3.1.3.10        Binary Property Values

   The iCalendar Object supports inclusion of binary information, such
   as computer graphic images (e.g., IMAGE/JPEG), digital audio (e.g.,
   AUDIO/BASIC), or video graphic images (e.g., VIDEO/MPEG). As
   specified above the binary information can be referenced with a
   Uniform Reference Locator (URL), referenced within an external MIME
   message, referenced within a particular MIME message body part, or
   placed inline. Inline binary information is included as a property
   value after being binary encoded using Base 64 (default) or Quoted-
   Printable transfer encoding.

3.1.3.11        Recurrence Rule Grammar

   Recurring events within the iCalendar Object may be specified as
   either a list of discrete date and time values or as a recurrence
   rule using a grammar. The basic recurrence rule grammar used by this
   specification is defined in a separate section of this specification.
   The grammar defines a recurrence rule that that is based on the prior
   work of the X.400 API Association's Calendaring and Scheduling
   Subcommittee. It is also based on prior work of the IETF Chronos
   Working Group. Refer to section 3.3.

3.1.4   Body Delimiter Properties

   The body information of a iCalendar Object is defined by a series of
   body fields or properties. This section defines the properties that
   can be used in MIME entities conforming to this content type.

3.1.4.1 Calendar Object

   The body of the iCalendar Object is identified within the body of a
   MIME entity by the appearance of the Begin Calendar Object Delimiter:

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR

   The sentinel string must appear as the first characters in the body
   of the MIME entity and as the first characters on a line.

   The body information of the iCalendar Object is terminated by the
   appearance of the End Calendar Object Delimiter as the first
   characters on a line:

     END:VCALENDAR

   The iCalendar Object is a container for calendar components. These
   can include either event or to-do components. The body of a iCalendar
   Object will generally contain a single calendar event or to-do
   component. However, the body may include multiple event or to-do
   components. This is the case for free-busy time reply messages that
   contain multiple free time intervals in individual calendar
   components.

   The Begin and End Calendar Object Delimiter properties are required
   in a MIME entity conforming to this content type. The data type for
   these properties is a STRING.

3.1.4.2 Event Component

   An Event Component is a grouping of calendaring and scheduling
   properties that defines a component that represents a scheduled
   amount of time on a calendar. For example, it may be an activity;
   such as a one-hour, department meeting from 8 AM to 9 AM, tomorrow or
   a free/busy time interval.

   An individual Event Component is identified within a MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type by the appearance of the delimiter:

     BEGIN:VEVENT

   The sentinel string must appear as the first characters on a line.

   The Event Component is terminated with the appearance of the
   following delimiter string as the first characters on a line

     END:VEVENT

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   The Event Component can not be nested within another Event or To-do
   Component. If Event components need to be related to each other or to
   a To-do Component, they can specify a relationship with the RELATED-
   TO property.

   The Begin and End Event Component Delimiter properties are required
   for a MIME entity containing an event component and conforming to
   this content type. The data type for these properties is a STRING.

3.1.4.3 To-do Component

   A To-do Component is a grouping of calendaring and scheduling
   properties that define a component that represents an action-item or
   assignment. For example, it may be an item of work assigned to an
   individual; such as _turn in travel expense today_.

   An individual To-do Component is identified within a MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type by the appearance of the delimiter:

     BEGIN:VTODO

   The sentinel string must appear as the first characters on a line.

   The To-do Component is terminated with the appearance of the
   following delimiter string as the first characters on a line

     END:VTODO

   The To-do Component can not be nested within another To-do or Event
   Component. If To-do components need to be related to each other or to
   an Event Component, they can specify a relationship with the RELATED-
   TO property.

   The Begin and End To-do Component Delimiter properties are required
   for a MIME entity containing a to-do component and conforming to this
   content type. The data type for these properties is a STRING.

3.1.5   Calendar Object Properties

   The following properties may appear between the Begin Calendar Object
   Delimiter and either the Begin Event Component Delimiter or the Begin
   To-do Component Delimiter. These properties define body field values
   that apply to the complete calendar object.

3.1.5.1 Calendar Content Profile

   This property is identified by the property name PROFILE. This
   property defines the usage profile associated with the calendar
   object. When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
   property MUST be the same as the Content-Type profile parameter
   value. This property can only appear once within the iCalendar
   Object.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. In the event that this property is not specified, the
   recipient of a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type should
   assume the calendar object is for an _event/request_. The data type
   for this property is STRING.

3.1.5.2 Calendar Scale

   This property is identified by the property name CALENDAR. This
   property defines the calendar scale used for the calendar information
   specified in the iCalendar Object. This specification is based on the
   Gregorian calendar scale. The Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if
   this property is not specified in the iCalendar Object. It is
   expected that other calendar scales will be defined in other
   specifications or by future versions of this specification.

   The following is an example of this property:

     CALENDAR:GREGORIAN

   The data type for this property is STRING.

3.1.5.3 Daylight Savings Rule

   This property is identified by the property name DAYLIGHT. This
   property defines the effective daylight savings time rule for
   calendar information specified in the iCalendar Object. More than one
   DAYLIGHT properties can be specified for a series of future DST rules
   for the time zone.

   Many locations adjust their standard time forward or backward by one
   hour, in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of daylight
   hours. Some locations adjust their time by a fraction of an hour.
   Standard time is also known as Winter Time. Daylight savings time is
   also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain
   countries.

   The property value consists of a sequence of components that define a
   rule for the observance of daylight savings time. The value consists
   of effective start date for the DST rule, followed by the daylight
   savings time flag, followed by the daylight savings time offset from
   UTC, followed by the date and time of the transition from standard
   time to daylight savings time, followed by the date and time of the
   transition from daylight savings time to standard time, followed by
   the customary standard time designation, followed by the customary
   daylight savings time designation. The effective start date for the
   DST rule allows for the specification of a series of future DST rules
   for a given time zone. The daylight savings time flag is TRUE if
   daylight savings time is observed, otherwise it is FALSE and no other
   components are specified. The daylight savings time offset value is
   specified in a manner consistent with ISO 8601. The property value is
   a signed numeric indicating the number of hours and possibly minutes
   from UTC. The date and time that the daylight savings time begins and
   ends is specified in a manner consistent with ISO 8601 date and time

     DAYLIGHT:19960407;TRUE;-09;19960407T115959;19961027T100000;PST;PDT

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. In the event that this property is not specified, the
   recipient of a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type should
   assume the same daylight savings time rule as the recipient location.
   The data type for this property is DST-RULE.

3.1.5.4 Geographic Position

   This property is identified by the property name GEO. This property
   specifies information related to the global position of the _home_
   system that created the MIME calendar object. The property value
   specifies longitude and latitude. The longitude represents the
   location east and west of the prime meridian as a positive or
   negative real number, respectively. The latitude represents the
   location north and south of the equator as a positive or negative
   real number, respectively. The following is an example of this
   property:

     GEO:37.24,-17.87

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is FLOAT-LIST.
   Optionally, the data type for this property may be URL. The URL is
   the resource location for the geographical position value.

3.1.5.5 Product Identifier

   This property is identified by the property name PRODID. This
   property specifies the identifier for the product that created the
   MIME calendar object. The vendor of the implementation should assure
   that this is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such
   as an ISO 9070 FPI value. The following is an example of this
   property:

     PRODID:-//ABC Corporation//NONSGML My Product//EN

   This property is required for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is STRING.
   Optionally, the data type may be URL. The URL is the resource
   location for the product identifier value.

3.1.5.6 Time Zone

   This property is identified by the property name TZ. This property
   specifies the standard time zone of the _home_ system that created
   the MIME calendar object. The property value is specified in a manner
   consistent with ISO 8601. The property value is a signed numeric
   indicating the number of hours and possibly minutes from UTC. Time
   zones east of UTC are positive numbers. Time zones west of UTC are
   negative numbers. The following are examples of this property:

     TZ:-0500

     TZ:+05:30

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. If this property is missing, the recipient should
   assume all local times are relative to the recipients time zone. The
   data type for this property is TIME-OFFSET. Optionally, the data type
   for this property may be STRING.

3.1.5.7 Version

   This property specifies the identifier corresponding to the highest
   version number of the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   specification supported by the implementation that created the MIME
   calendar object. The value of this property must be 2.0 to correspond
   to this specification..

   This property is identified by the property name VERSION. The
   following is an example of this property:

     VERSION:2.0

   This property is required for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. This property must appear within the MIME calendar
   object. The data type for this property is FLOAT.

3.1.6   Event and To-do Component Properties

   The following properties apply to either an event or to-do calendar
   object component.

3.1.6.1 Attachment

   This property is identified by the property name ATTACH. The property
   defines an attached object to the MIME calendar object. For example,
   a document to be reviewed at a scheduled event or the process steps
   for a to-do. The property value can be a text string, a reference to
   another message body part or a reference to a URL corresponding to a
   document.

   Multiple attachments may be specified by including multiple ATTACH
   properties within the MIME calendaring entity.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is MID. The
   data type may alternatively be specified to be CID, URL, or STRING
   value.

3.1.6.2 Attendee

   This property is identified by the property name ATTENDEE. The
   property defines an attendee to a group event or to-do. The default
   property value is an (RFC 822) address. The property may include
   property parameters TYPE, for the type of attendee, ROLE, for the
   role of the attendee in the event or to-do; STATUS, for the status of
   the attendee's participation in the event or to-do, RSVP, for
   indicating whether the favor of a reply is requested, EXPECT, to
   indicate the expectation of the attendee's participation by the
   originator, and MEMBER, to indicate the group that the attendee
   belongs to.

   Multiple attendees may be specified by including multiple ATTENDEE
   properties within the MIME calendaring entity.

   The property value may reference a vCard object. This provides a
   useful mechanism to allow more than just the address of the attendee
   to be referenced.

   The TYPE property parameter for each attendee can have the following
   values:

   content type. The data type for this property is STRING-LIST.

3.1.6.5 Classification

   This property is identified by the property name CLASS. This property
   defines the access classification for the MIME calendar component.

   A calendar event/to-do access classification is only one component of
   the general security system within a calendar application. It
   provides a method of capturing the scope of the access the calendar
   owner intends for information within an individual calendar entry.
   The access classification of an individual MIME calendaring entity is
   useful when measured along with the other security components of a
   calendar system (e.g., user authorization, access rights, access
   role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual access
   classifications can not be completely defined by this specification.
   Additionally, due to the _blind_ nature of most exchange processes
   using this specification, these entity classifications can not serve
   as an enforcement statement for a system receiving a MIME calendar
   object . Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of
   the calendar owner for the access to the MIME calendar object
   component.

   The following is an example of this property:

     CLASS:PUBLIC

   The property can have the following values:

   defines the date and time that the to-do is due to be completed. The
   date and time value is expressed in the complete representation,
   basic or extended format as specified in ISO 8601. The time can
   either be in local or UTC based time. Alternatively, the value may be
   a duration of time, expressed in the ISO 8601 format as specified in
   section 3.1.3.8. In this case, the end is relative to the start of
   the MIME calendar component. The following is an example of this
   property:

     DUE:19960401T235959Z

   This property is required for MIME entities consisting of a to-do
   calendar component that conforms to this content type. The default
   data type for this property is DATE-TIME. Optionally, the data type
   may be specified as a DURATION.

3.1.6.11        Duration

   This property is identified by the property name DURATION. The
   property specifies an interval or duration of time. This property can
   be used with the DTSTART property to specify a relative duration for
   an event (e.g., event starts at 8:00 am and lasts for one hour). The
   property can also be used in constructing a free-busy time request
   (e.g., find free time periods of 15 minute duration, or longer). The
   following is an example of this property that specifies an interval
   of time of 1 hour and zero minutes and zero seconds:

     DURATION:PT1H0M0S

   The following is an example of this property that specifies an
   interval of time of 15 minutes.

     DURATION:PT15M

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The data type for this property is DURATION.

3.1.6.12        End Date/Time

   This property is identified by the property name DTEND. This property
   defines the date and time that the event component will end. The date
   and time value is expressed in the complete representation, basic or
   extended format as specified in ISO 8601. The time can either be in
   local or UTC based time. Alternatively, the value may be a duration
   of time, expressed in the ISO 8601 format as specified in section
   3.1.3.8. In this case, the end is relative to the start of the MIME
   calendar component. Events may have an end date/time but no start
   date/time. In that case, the event does not take up any time. The
   following is an example of this property:

     DTEND:19960401T235959Z

   Optionally the data type may URL, MID, or CID.

3.1.6.17        Mail Reminder

   This property is identified by the property name MALARM. The property
   defines an email address that is to be sent a reminder for the MIME
   calendar component. A mail reminder is an electronic mail address
   that will be sent a display string as an alarm for a calendar
   component.

   The value for the procedure reminder consists of the Run Time, or the
   date and time that the reminder is to be executed; Snooze Time, or
   the duration of time after the Run Time that the reminder is to be
   dormant prior to being repeated; Repeat Count, or the number of times
   that the reminder is to be repeated; Email Address, or the (RFC 822)
   email address that is to be sent the reminder, Subject, or the
   textual subject of the note, and the Note, or the textual reminder
   string that is to be sent to the email address.

   The following is an example of this property:

     MALARM:19960416T000000-0500;PT1H;24;IRS@us.gov;My Payment;
        The Check Is In The Mail!

   The Reminder properties are primarily provided as a means for
   allowing the capture of alarm information when accessing a calendar
   system. It may not be an appropriate property to send in an event or
   to-do request.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is MALARM.
   Optionally, the data type may be URL, MID, or CID.

3.1.6.18        Number Recurrences

   This property is identified by the property name RNUM. The property
   defines the number of times the calendar entry will reoccur. The
   value is equal to the number of recurrences that are specified by the
   union of the Recurrence Dates, Recurrence Rule, Exception Dates, and
   Exception Rule property values. The following is an example of this
   property:

     RNUM:3

   In the event that this value does not match the computed number of
   recurrences, it will be ignored and the computed number of
   recurrences will be used.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The data type for this property is INTEGER.

3.1.6.19        Priority

   This property is identified by the property name PRIORITY. The
   property defines the priority for the MIME calendar component. The
   value is an alphanumeric. A value of zero (ASCII decimal 48)
   specifies an undefined priority. A value of one (ASCII decimal 49) is
   the highest priority. A value of two (ASCII decimal 50) is the second
   highest priority. Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing ordinal
   priority. The following is an example of this property:

     PRIORITY:2

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is STRING.
   Optionally the data type may be specified to be INTEGER.

3.1.6.20        Procedure Reminder

   This property is identified by the property name PALARM. The property
   defines a procedure reminder for the MIME calendar component. A
   procedure reminder is a procedure, or application executable that
   will be run as an alarm for a calendar component.

   While this property has many useful purposes, implementers should be
   aware of the security implications of sending a MIME calendaring
   entity containing this property. The security implications are
   similar to those associated with active messages within electronic
   mail.

   The value for the procedure reminder consists of the Run Time, or the
   date and time that the reminder is to be executed; Snooze Time, or
   the duration of time after the Run Time that the reminder is to be
   dormant prior to being repeated; Repeat Count, or the number of times
   that the reminder is to be repeated; and the Procedure Name, or the
   path to the procedure to be run when the reminder is executed.
   Parameters are passed to the procedure by concatenating to the

   The Reminder properties are primarily provided as a means for
   allowing the capture of alarm information when accessing a calendar
   system. It may not be an appropriate property to send in an event or
   to-do request.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is PALARM.
   Optionally, the data type may be URL, MID, or CID.

3.1.6.21        Related To

   This property is identified by the property name RELATED-TO. The
   property is used to represent relationships or references between
   this MIME calendar component and another. The property value consists
   of the persistent, globally unique identifier of another MIME
   calendar component. This value would be represented in a MIME
   calendar component by the UID property.

   A linked relationship can be specified by a series of components that
   each, in turn, refer to their parent component. A group relationship
   can be specified by a number of components that all refer to one
   common parent component.

   Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property may
   impact the related calendar component. For example, if a group event
   changes its start or end date or time, then the related, dependent
   events will need to have their start and end dates changed in a
   corresponding way. This property is intended only to provide
   information on the relationship of calendar components. It is up to
   the target calendar system to maintain this relationship.

   The following is an example of this property:

     RELATED-TO:<jsmith.part7.19960817T083000.xyzMail@host3.com>

     RELATED-TO:19960401-080045-4000F192713-0052

   define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. When they both
   appear in an iCalendar Object, the recurring events are defined by
   the union of occurrences defined by both the RDATE and RRULE. The
   date and time values is expressed in the complete representation,
   basic format as specified in ISO 8601. The times can either be in
   local or UTC based time. The number of recurring date/times is
   specified by the Number Recurrences property. The following is an
   example of this property:

     RDATE:19960402T010000Z;19960403T010000Z;19960404T010000Z

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is D-T-LIST.
   Optionally, the data type may be URL; in which case the value is the
   location where a list of recurring dates can be found. This latter
   case is a useful method for conveying dynamic recurring dates, such
   as schedules, for a recurring event or to-do.

3.1.6.23        Recurrence Rule

   This property is identified by the property name RRULE. This property
   defines a rule or repeating pattern for a recurring MIME calendar
   component, based on the Basic Recurrence Rule Grammar of [XAPIA]. The
   value for the property is a pattern specification for the recurrence.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The data type for this property is INTEGER.

3.1.6.27        Start Date/Time

   This property is identified by the property name DTSTART. This
   property defines the date and time that the calendar component will
   start. The date and time value is expressed in the complete
   representation, basic format as specified in ISO 8601. The time can
   either be in local or UTC based time. Alternatively, the value may be
   a duration of time, expressed in the ISO 8601 format as specified in
   section 3.1.3.8. In this case, the start is relative to another MIME
   calendar component specified by the RELATED-TO property. Events may
   have a start date/time but no end date/time. In that case, the event
   does not take up any time. The following is an example of this
   property:

     DTSTART:19960401T235959-0600

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this

   This property is required for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The data type for this property is STRING.

3.1.6.30        Time Transparency

   This property is identified by the property name TRANSP. This
   property defines whether the event is transparent to free time
   searches. The value of this property is a number. A value of zero
   (ASCII decimal 48) guarantees that the entry will blocks time and
   will be factored into a free time search. A value of one (ASCII
   decimal 49) specifies that the entry will not block time and will not
   be factored into a free time search. Any values greater than _1_ will
   provide implementation specific transparency semantics. Some
   implementations may treat values greater than one as non-blocking or
   transparent events. Other implementations may use the numeric value
   to provide a layering of levels of transparency. The default value is
   zero (ASCII decimal 48), the event is not transparent and will block
   free time searches. The following is an example of this property:

     TRANSP:0

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The data type for this property is INTEGER.

3.1.6.31        Uniform Resource Locator

   This property is identified by the property name URL. This property
   defines a Uniform Resource Locator for an Internet location that can
   be used to obtain real-time information associated with the MIME
   calendar component. Valid values for this property are a string
   conforming to [RFC 1738]. The following is an example of this
   property:

     URL:http://abc.com/pub/calendars/jsmith/mytime.or3

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The data type for this property is URL.

3.1.6.32        Unique Identifier

   This property is identified by the property name UID. This property
   defines a persistent, globally unique identifier associated with the
   MIME calendar component. Some examples of forms of unique identifiers
   would include ISO 9070 formal public identifiers (FPI), X.500
   distinguished names, machine-generated _random_ numbers with a
   statistically high likelihood of being globally unique and Uniform

   Resource Locators (URL). If an URL is specified, it is suggested that
   the URL reference a service which can provide an updated version of
   the MIME calendar component. The following is an example of this
   property:

     UID:19960401-080045-4000F192713-0052

   This property is an important method for group scheduling
   applications to match calendar entities with later modification or
   deletion requests. Calendaring and scheduling applications that do
   not generate this property in MIME calendar components may be
   limiting their interoperability with other group scheduling
   applications.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is STRING.
   Optionally, the data type may be URL, MID, or CID.

3.1.6.33        Non-standard Properties

   The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type provides a _standard
   mechanism for doing non-standard things_. This extension support is
   provided for implementers to _push the envelope_ on the existing
   version of the specification. Extension properties are specified by
   property and/or property parameter names that have the initial sub-
   string of X- (the two character sequence: Capital X character
   followed by the Dash character). It is recommended that vendors
   concatenate onto this sentinel an added short sub-string to identify
   the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the extensions and
   minimize possible collision of names between different vendors. User
   agents that support this content type are expected to be able to
   parse the extension properties and property parameters but may ignore
   them. The following might be the ABC vendor's extension for an audio-
   clip form of subject property:

3.2     Formal Definition

   The following modified Backus-Naur Notation (BNF) is provided to
   assist developers in building parsers for the properties of this MIME
   content type..

     This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC
     822,but it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:

     CR         = <ASCII CR, carriage return>  ; (     15,      13.)

     LF         = <ASCII LF, linefeed>         ; (     12,      10.)

3.3     Basic Recurrence Rule Grammar

   The specification of recurring events can be simplified by the use of
   a grammar or rule notation. This specification makes use of the Base
   Recurrence Rule Grammar from the [XAPIA].

   A recurrence rule is a string or clear-text encoding of a recurrence
   specification. A recurrence rule is composed of several components. A
   rule begins with a frequency which describes the type of repeating
   event (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.). This is followed by an interval
   which indicates how often the frequency repeats (i.e., daily, every
   third day, etc.). This can be followed by optional frequency modifier
   information and either an end date or a duration.

   Below is the form of a typical rule. This example causes events to be
   generated every other week on Tuesday and Thursday, for 8
   occurrences:

     W2 TU TH #4

   Where, W is the Frequency, 2 is the Interval, TU and TH are the
   optional Frequency Modifiers, and #4 is the Duration.

   The basic recurrence rule grammar supports six types of repetition.
   The six types follow the same form with only the frequency name and
   optional modifier information changing from one type of frequency to
   the next.

3.3.1   Daily Rule

   The daily rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an
   interval of a day or more. These can range from every day to every
   200th day and beyond. The daily rule begins with the letter D
   followed by an interval (representing days) and an optional duration
   or end date.

   Some examples follow:

     Daily for 10 occurrences:
        D1 #10

     Daily until 12/24/94:
        D1 19941224T000000Z

     Every other day - forever:
        D2 #0

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


     Every 10 days, 5 occurrences:
        D10 #5

3.3.2   Weekly Rule

   The weekly rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an
   interval of a week or more. The basic weekly rule has the same form
   as the daily rule except that the rule begins with a W and can
   contain an optional list of weekdays the events are generated on. For
   weekly rules, the interval represents weeks. Some examples follow:

     Weekly for 10 occurrences:
        W1 #10

     Weekly until 12/24/94:
        W1 19941224T000000Z

     Every other week - forever:
        W2 #0

     Weekly on Tuesday and
     Thursday for 5 weeks:
        W1 TU TH #5

     Every other week on Monday Wednesday and Friday until 12/24/94:
        W2 MO WE FR 19941224T000000Z

3.3.3   Monthly Rule

   The monthly rule is used for specifying repeating events base on an
   interval of a month or more. There are two types of monthly
   recurrence rules. One for by-position and one for by-day. The by-
   position rule allows weekdays in the month to be specified in
   relation to their occurrence in the month. An example would be to
   specify the third Sunday of the month or the last Friday of the
   month. An occurrence specifier may be used in monthly by-position
   rules. The occurrence specifiers control which occurrence of a
   weekday in a month an event occurs on:

     1+, 2+, ... 5+ for the first occurrence, second, ...fifth
     occurrence of the month.

     1-, 2-, ... 5- for the last occurrence, second to last occurrence,
     etc.

   A 2+ FR SA would indicate the second occurrence of Friday and
   Saturday in the month. A 1- MO would indicate the first occurrence of
   Monday working from the end of the month backwards (i.e., the last
   occurrence). A 2- MO would be the second to the last Monday of the
   month.

   A by-day rule allows actual day numbers to be specified such as the
   12th day or 29th day.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   The by-position rule begins with a MP and the by-day rule begins with
   a MD. The interval in monthly rules represents months. Some examples
   follow:

     Monthly on the 1st Friday for ten occurrences:
        MP1 1+ FR #10

     Monthly on the 1st Friday until 12/24/94:
        MP1 1+ FR 19941224T000000Z

     Every other month on the 1st and last
     Sunday of the month for 10 occurrences:
        MP2 1+ SU 1- SU #10

     Every six months on the 2nd Monday
     through Friday for 10 occurrences:
        MP6 2+ MO TU WE TH FR #10

     Monthly on the second last Monday of the month for 6 months:

        MP1 2- MO #6

     Monthly on the third to the last day of the month, forever:

        MD1 3- #0

     Monthly on the 2nd and 15th of the month for 10 occurrences:
        MD1 2 15 #10

     In the next example LD refers to _LastDay_ in a monthly recurrence
     rule. Monthly on the 1st and last day of the month for 10
     occurrences:
        MD1 1 LD #10 or MD1 1 1- #10

     Every 18 months on the 10th through 15th of the month for 10
     occurrences:
        MD18 10 11 12 13 14 15 #10

     Monthly on the second to the last day for 5 months. So, if the
     start date is August 1996, the event would repeat on 8/30/96,
     9/29/96, 10/30/96, 11/29/96, and 12/30/96:
        MD1 2- #5

3.3.4   Yearly Rule

   The yearly rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an
   interval of a year or more. There are two types of yearly recurrence
   rules. One for by-month and one for by-day. The by-month rule allows
   specific months out of the year to be specified. The by-day allows
   specific days to be specified. In the by-month rule, the day in the
   month the rule is to occur on is determined from the initial
   appointment.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   The by-month rule begins with a YM and the by-day rule begins with a
   YD. The interval in yearly rules represents years. Some examples
   follow:

     Yearly in June and July for 10 occurrences:
        YM1 6 7 #10

     Every other year on January, Feb, and March for 10 occurrences:
        YM2 1 2 3 #10

     Every 3rd year on the 1st, 100th and 200th day for 10 occurrences:
        YD3 1 100 200 #10

   duration     Controls the number of events a rule generates.

   Lastday      Can be used as a replacement to daynumber to indicate
   the last day of the month.

   daynumber    A number representing a day of the month.

   month                A number representing a month of the year.

3.3.7   Policies

   1.      The duration portion of a rule defines the total number of events
     the rule generates, including the first event.

   2.      Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
     next event time and date is derived from the Start Time entry
     attribute.

   3.      If an end date and a duration is specified in the rule, the
     recurring event ceases when the end date is reached or the number
     of events indicated in the duration occur; whichever comes first.

   4.      If the duration or an end date is not established in the rule
     (e.g., D4) the event occurs twice. That is D4 is equivalent to D4
     #2.

   5.      A duration of #0 means repeat this event forever.

   6.      Using the occurrence specifier 5+ (e.g. 5th Friday) or 5- (e.g.
     5th from last Friday) in a month that does not contain 5 weeks
     does not generate an event and thus does not count against the
     duration. The same applies to providing a day of the month that
     does not occur in the month. For example the 30th or 31st .

   7.      The start time and date of an entry must be synchronized with one
     of the repeating events defined by its recurrence rule. The
     following is not allowed:

        Initial Appointment Date:       7/1/94 (Friday)
        Recurrence Rule:                W1 MO TH #5

     The following is acceptable:

        Initial Appt Date:      7/1/94 (Friday)
        Recurrence Rule:                W1 MO FR #5 or W1 #5


Dawson/Stenerson                   58               Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   8.      If the optional <occurrencelist> and <weekdaylist> information is
     missing from a <monthlybypos> occurrence the information is
     derived from the entry attributes. The <occurrence> used in the
     recurring event is a count from the beginning of the month to the
     entry date and the <weekday> used is the day of the week the entry
     is scheduled to occur on.

   9.      If the <monthlybypos> occurrence or <monthlybyday> occurrence does
     not list a week day (e.g., SU or day 10) in the rule, the week day
     is established from the entry attribute information. As an example
     the rule MP1 #3 used in an entry with a start date of 7/20/94
     (which is the third Wednesday of the month) repeats on 8/17/94
     which is the third Wednesday of the month.

4.      Registration of Content Type Profiles

   This section defines procedures by which usage profiles for the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type are registered with the IANA
   and made available to the Internet community. Note that non-IANA
   profiles may be used by bilateral agreement, provided the associated
   profile names follow the "X-" convention defined above in section
   3.1.6.33.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new profiles, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new profiles.

   Registration of a new profile is accomplished by the following steps.

4.1     Define the profile

   A profile is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME profile XXX

     Profile name:

     Profile purpose:

     Profile type-subtype:

     Profile special notes (optional):

     Intended usage: (one of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)

   The explanation of what goes in each field in the template follows.

   Profile name: The name of the profile as it will be generally
   referred to in public. This name is required in the profile.





Dawson/Stenerson                   59               Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   Profile purpose: The purpose of the profile (e.g., to schedule
   document management updates, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description. This description is required in the profile.

   Profile type-subtype: The type-subtypes of the profile as they will
   appear in the text/calendar MIME Content-Type Profile parameter. This
   list of type-subtype values is required in the profile.

   Profile properties: The list of MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type properties associated with the profile. This list of
   properties that are included in the profile. If a property is
   required by the profile, it should noted in this section. Other types
   not mentioned in the profile definition may also be present. Note
   that any new properties referenced by the profile must be defined
   separately as described in section .

   Profile special notes: Any special notes about the profile, how it is
   to be used, etc. This section is not required in the profile.

4.2     Post the profile definition

   The profile description must be posted to the IETF Calendaring and
   Scheduling Working Group discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

4.3     Allow a comment period

   Discussion on the new profile must be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus must be reached on the
   profile before submitting the profile for approval.

4.4     Submit the profile for approval

   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the profile, the registration
   application should be submitted to the Profile Reviewer for approval.

   The Profile Reviewer is appointed to the Application Area Directors
   and may either accept or reject the profile registration. An accepted
   registration should be passed on by the Profile Reviewer to the IANA
   for inclusion in the official IANA profile registry. The registration
   may be rejected for any of the following reasons. 1) Insufficient
   comment period; 2) Consensus not reached; 3) Technical deficiencies
   raised on the list or elsewhere have not been addressed. The Profile
   Reviewer's decision to reject a profile may be appealed by the
   proposer to the IESG, or the objections raised can be addressed by
   the proposer and the profile resubmitted.

4.5     Profile Change Control

   Existing profiles may be changed using the same process by which they
   were registered.

   1.      Define the change



Dawson/Stenerson                   60               Expires August 1997


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   2.      Post the change

   3.      Allow a comment period

   4.      Submit the profile for approval

   Note that the original author or any other interested party may
   propose a change to an existing profile, but that such changes should
   only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in the
   published specification. The Profile Reviewer may object to a change
   if it is not backwards compatible, but is not required to do so.

   Profile definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   profiles which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.

4.6     Registration of New Content Type Properties

   This section defines procedures by which new properties for the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type are registered with the IANA.
   Note that non-IANA properties may be used by bilateral agreement,
   provided the associated properties names follow the "X-" convention
   defined above in section 3.1.6.33.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

4.6.1   Define the property

   A property is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX

     Property name:

     Property purpose:

     Property data type(s):

     Property encoding:

     Property special notes (optional):

     Intended usage: (one of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)

   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification     February 3, 1997


   Property name: The name of the property, as it will appear in the
   body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line to
   the left of the colon ":".

   Property purpose: The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
   delegate for the event or to-do, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description.

   Property data type(s): Any of the valid data types for the property
   value needs to be specified. The default data type also needs to be
   specified. If a new data type is specified, it needs to be declared
   in this section.

   Property encoding: The encodings permitted for the property value.
   This description must be precise and must not violate the general
   encoding rules defined in this document.

   Property special notes: Any special notes about the property, how it
   is to be used, etc.

4.6.2   Post the Property definition

   The property description must be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

4.6.3   Allow a comment period

   Discussion on the new property must be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus must be reached on the
   property before proceeding to the next step.

4.6.4   Submit the property for approval

   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Profile Reviewer
   for approval. The Profile Reviewer is appointed to the Application
   Area Directors and may either accept or reject the property
   registration. An accepted registration should be passed on by the
   Profile Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA
   profile registry. The registration may be rejected for any of the
   following reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not
   reached; 3) Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere
   have not been addressed. The Profile Reviewer's decision to

   reject a property may be appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the
   objections raised can be addressed by the proposer and the property
   resubmitted.

4.7     Content Type Property Change Control

   Existing properties may be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.

        1.           Define the change

        2.           Post the change

        3.           Allow a comment period

        4.           Submit the property for approval

   Note that the original author or any other interested party may
   propose a change to an existing property, but that such changes
   should only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in
   the published specification. The Profile Reviewer may object to a
   change if it is not backwards compatible, but is not required to do
   so.

   Property definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   properties which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.
