        The Need to Convey Carrier Selection Information in SIP
                  draft-haluska-dispatch-csi-needed-00

Abstract

   This draft documents a need for the ability to signal Carrier
   Selection Information, which identifies how the carrier chosen for a
   call was selected, using SIP, and identifies a documented though not
   yet standardized mechanism which addresses this need.

2.   Problem Statement

   In the PSTN, Interexchange Carriers (IXCs) provide services including
   routing calls between different networks.  In North America,
   subscribers can presubscribe to a particular IXC to handle calls by
   default.  The IXC may be selected by other means.  For example, the
   caller may dial a specific prefix identifying the desired IXC.

   When calls involving IXCs are made, it is required to record not only
   the IXC used for the call, but also the method by which that IXC was
   selected.  Thus, this information needs to be conveyed in signaling.
   In ISUP this is conveyed using the Carrier Selection Information
   (CSI) parameter.

   Services currently implemented in the PSTN including Operator
   Services and Directory Assistance make use of the ISUP CSI parameter,
   e.g. for usage collection purposes.  Such services are migrating to
   SIP based platforms, and the need for exchanging this information in
   signaling still exists.

   Current SIP-ISUP interworking standards do not specify a SIP mapping
   for the CSI parameter.  Thus, when interworking from ISUP to SIP, the
   CSI parameter is carried in an encapsulated ISUP message in a MIME
   body.

   For SIP originated calls, there is currently no standardized way to
   carry this information.

   The "dai" tel URI parameter described in [I-D.draft-yu-tel-dai-08] is
   intended to convey this information in SIP.  This parameter, if
   standardized, would provide a mechanism allowing for the exchange of
   this information using SIP.

3.  Conclusion

   In environments such as the North American PSTN where carrier
   selection is implemented, there is a need to convey how the chosen
   carrier was selected.  This information is still needed going forward
   using SIP.  The "DAI" parameter defined in [I-D.draft-yu-tel-dai-08]
   can be used to exchange this information.
