Internet-Draft            6LoWPAN Interop Test                 July 2007


1.  Introduction

   A method for transmitting IPv6 [RFC2460] packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   [ieee802.15.4] networks was specified in [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-format] as
   a proposed standard.  To advance the specification to a draft
   standard, the Internet standards process [RFC2026] requires
   demonstration of at least two independent and interoperable
   implementations in order to advance the specification to a draft
   standard.

   The 6LoWPAN format supports a pay-as-you-go approach, where simple,
   common-case packets are highly compressed and less commonly used
   mechanisms are inserted as needed.  While complete interoperability
   will require demonstrating all possible combinations of the 6LoWPAN
   format, it is often useful to test and demonstrate smaller portions
   along the way.  This memo defines the first step in the process,
   identified as Level 0 and Level 1 6LoWPAN Interoperability.  Level 0
   is basic uncompress IPv6 unicast communication of IPv6 datagrams.
   Level 1 addresses the simple, but common case: fully-compressed link-
   local, unicast communication of IPv6 datagrams.  It is anticipated
   that additional interoperability levels will be defined in the
   future.

   This memo only provides information to the Internet community, it
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.


2.  Level 0 Interoperability Requirements

   Level 0 interoperability must demonstrate the capability to both
   generate and process uncompressed unicast packets.  Because 6LoWPAN
   only defines the format (i.e. how bits go on the air), ICMPv6 and UDP
   echo request/reply are used as the protocols for demonstration.
   Level 0 interoperability does not demonstrate the ability to generate
   or process the 6LoWPAN Mesh, Fragmentation, or Broadcast headers.

   The Level 0.0 interoperability requirements are as follows:

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support a uncompressed header for
      link-local unicast.  Version is IPv6.  Next Header is either UDP
      or ICMP.  The IEEE 802.15.4 header contains full 8-byte EUI-64
      addressing for both source and destination addresses, the PAN ID
      compression is enabled, and no link-layer security mechanisms are
      enabled.  The 802.15.4 header size in this scenario is 21 octets,
      not including the length field (1 octet).  The 802.15.4 footer
      consists of the FCS (2 octets).

Internet-Draft            6LoWPAN Interop Test                 July 2007


   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support ICMPv6 echo and reply
      processing as specified in ICMPv6 [RFC4443].  The generation of
      ICMPv6 echo requests can be signaled by an internal timer,
      commands through an independent interface (e.g. serial), or
      external events (e.g. user button).  The generation of ICMPv6 echo
      replies should be generated in response to echo requests as
      specified in [RFC4443].  Because this interoperability level does
      not demonstrate fragmentation and IEEE 802.15.4's MTU 127 octets,
      echo request/reply payloads will be limited to what fits in a
      single frame.

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support UDP echo/reply on port 7
      as specified in Echo Protocol [RFC0862].  The use of UDP echo/
      reply must follow the same generation and maximum size guidelines
      as above for ICMPv6 echo/reply.

   The Level 0.1 interoperability requirements are as follows:

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support a uncompressed header as
      per level 0.0, but for global unicast addresses.


3.  Level 1 Interoperability Requirements

   Level 1 interoperability must demonstrate the capability to both
   generate and process LOWPAN_HC1 packets.  Because 6LoWPAN only
   defines the format (i.e. how bits go on the air), ICMPv6 and UDP echo
   request/reply are used as the protocols for demonstration.  Level 1
   interoperability does not demonstrate the ability to generate or
   process the 6LoWPAN Mesh, Fragmentation, or Broadcast headers.

   The Level 1 interoperability requirements are as follows:

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support a fully-compressed header.
      A fully-compressed header is defined as the minimal header format
      (inclusive of 802.15.4) that supports the required functionality.
      In the case of link-local unicast, the IPv6 header is compressed
      down to two octets: Hop Limit (1 octet) and LOWPAN_HC1 Encoding (1
      octet).  Of the compressed IPv6 header fields, Version is IPv6,
      Traffic Class and Flow Label is zero, Payload Length and both
      addresses are derived from the 802.15.4 header, and Next Header is
      either UDP or ICMP as specified in LOWPAN_HC1 Encoding.  A LoWPAN
      Dispatch header (1 octet) is used to identify LOWPAN_HC1 encoding.
      The IEEE 802.15.4 header contains full 8-byte EUI-64 addressing
      for both source and destination addresses, the PAN ID compression
      is enabled, and no link-layer security mechanisms are enabled.
      The 802.15.4 header size in this scenario is 21 octets, not
      including the length field (1 octet).  The 802.15.4 footer

      consists of the FCS (2 octets).

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support ICMPv6 echo and reply
      processing as specified in ICMPv6 [RFC4443].  The generation of
      ICMPv6 echo requests can be signaled by an internal timer,
      commands through an independent interface (e.g. serial), or
      external events (e.g. user button).  The generation of ICMPv6 echo
      replies should be generated in response to echo requests as
      specified in [RFC4443].  Because this interoperability level does
      not demonstrate fragmentation and IEEE 802.15.4's MTU 127 octets,
      echo request/reply payloads will be limited to what fits in a
      single frame.

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support UDP [RFC0768] with HC_UDP
      encoding with a fully-compressed header.  A fully-compressed
      header is defined as having the HC_UDP encoding (1 octet),
      compressed UDP source and destination ports (1 octet), as well as
      compressed length.  The UDP checksum field is not compressed (2
      octets).  The total size of the UDP header is (4 octets).

   o  The 6LoWPAN implementation must support UDP echo/reply specified
      in Echo Protocol [RFC0862].  Because HC_UDP does not support
      compression of port value 7, Level 1.0 interop specifies using
      port 61616 + 7 = 61623 as the echo port.  The use of UDP echo/
      reply must follow the same generation and maximum size guidelines
      as above for ICMPv6 echo/reply.

   The header formats (including 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN) of this
   interoperability test is shown in Figure 1.
