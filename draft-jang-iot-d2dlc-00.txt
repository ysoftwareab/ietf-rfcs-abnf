Abstract

Recently, D2D communication is drawing attention as a technology 
capable of reducing an excessive load on a network infrastructure and
increasing network coverage. When using heterogeneous wireless 
communication technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth, which are 
basically provided to user terminals such as smartphones, the 
connectivity of D2D communication can be further strengthened.
In this paper, we propose a multi-hop communication technique using 
heterogeneous wireless communication technologies.

1.  Introduction

As the amount of mobile traffic generated by user terminals such as 
smartphones, which are widely used in recent years, is rapidly 
increasing, a direct communication between terminals (D2D) technology 
is attracting attention as a technology for preventing excessive load 
on the network infrastructure. In particular, most user terminals such 
as smartphones are basically equipped with various wireless 
communication interfaces such as WiFi and Bluetooth as well as cellular 
interfaces. In an environment in which various wireless communication 
technologies are mixed, a multi-hop communication technology composed 
of heterogeneous links can provide more opportunities for connection 
between user terminals. In fact, it is known that the use of D2D 
communication services such as OpenGarden can increase the message 
delivery rate up to 80% in dense crowd environments such as movie 
theaters and concerts and emergency situations.
When implementing multi-hop networking technologies in the application 
layer, it has the advantage of supporting interworking between wireless
communication technologies that are rapidly developing with the advent
of the Internet of Things era without modifying the operating system. 
Therefore, in this document, we propose a heterogeneous multi-hop 
networking technique in the application layer and discuss 
considerations.

2.  Heterogenous Link Stitching

A brief description of the multi-hop networking technology in the 
application layer proposed in this document is shown in Figure 1. The 
agent application shown in Figure 1 is installed on nodes A, B, and C to
perform multi-hop communication consisting of WiFi and Bluetooth links.
In order to allow nodes A and C to send and receive HTTP data through a 
multi-hop path composed of heterogeneous links, the agent application is
capable of : 1) discovering of neighboring nodes using heterogeneous 
communication technology and end-to-end routes between them 2) providing
end-to-end TCP connections.


2.1 Discovering the neighboring nodes and end-to-end routes

As shown in Figure 1, suppose that nodes A and B have connectivity 
through WiFi using WiFi-Direct technology and Bluetooth technology, and 
nodes B and C have connectivity through Bluetooth. In a given environment
, agents installed in each node broadcast a HELLO message through all 
communication methods that exist in each terminal. Through the HELLO 
message, each terminal knows the address of a neighboring nodes connected
 via WiFi and Bluetooth. After the neighboring terminal is searched, the 
 agent of A sends out a route search message (e.g. RREQ message) through 
 all communication interfaces of A in order to find a route from terminal
 A to C. The RREQ message arriving at the agent of B through the WiFi 
 connection between A and B is delivered to C through the Bluetooth 
 interface of B, and through this, the multi-hop path consisting of 
 WiFi and Bluetooth from A to C is searched. The agent of each terminal 
 maintains the destination address and nexthop address found in this way.

2.2 End-to-end TCP Connection                            

In order for the web browser application (client) of node A to 
communicate with the HTTP server of node C, the agent of each node was 
implemented as a local HTTP proxy. All HTTP packets are sent to the

operating system's TCP layer. As shown in the red line in Figure 1, the 
HTTP payload goes through the agent, and the nexthop is determined 
according to the destination information maintained by the agent, and 
it goes down to the corresponding transmission layer. For example, in 
Figure 1, a packet whose destination is C's IP address is encapsulated
as an TCP/IP packet whose destination is B's IP address because the 
nexthop is B's WiFi interface. When it is delivered to B, and the 
agent of B forwards the original packet destined for C's IP address to
the corresponding nexthop, C's Bluetooth interface(Which has C's 
BTaddr as its Bluetooth address).

Figure 2. End-to-end TCP connection 

Figure 2 shows the connection and data transmission between each node 
for HTTP communication between nodes A-C in the situation of Figure 1.
The point to be considered in this situation is that node A's web 
browser (client) establishes a TCP connection with node A's agent
(HTTP proxy) as shown in the figure, so the reliability of the 
connection to node C cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each link must 
use reliable transmission protocols such as TCP and RFCOMM.
