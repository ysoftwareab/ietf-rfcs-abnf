1. Introduction 

   SIP has become a standard among many service providers, vendors, and 
   end users.  Although there are many different standards for measuring 
   the performance of signaling protocols, none of these have been 
   adapted for use with SIP.  This document is intended for providing a

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics      August 2006 
 
 
   guideline for the above listed entities in providing a standard 
   approach for measuring and reporting SIP performance metrics with an 
   end-to-end perspective.  This will allow a common approach and 
   understanding of performance expectations between service providers, 
   vendors, and the users of those services based on SIP. 

   The metrics defined in this document DO NOT take into consideration 
   durations, impairments, or failures associated with the actual 
   application processing of a request or response.  Metrics associated 
   with single device application processing are out of scope of this 
   document. 

   Some metric inputs in this document are affected by external 
   variables to SIP.  The following list provides examples, but should 
   NOT be considered exhaustive:  

     . Network connectivity 

     . Switch and router performance 

     . Server processes and hardware performance 

   Note that some metrics in this document may not apply to all 
   applications of SIP.  This document provides an overview of pertinent 
   metrics, which may be used individually or as a set based on the 
   usage of SIP within the context of a given service. 

   This document provides a common subset of metrics with a common 
   industry agreed upon definition.  This document does not provide any 
   standard or benchmark value regarding IETF recommended performance 
   criteria to compare any output value derived from the following 
   described metrics. 

  
2. Terminology 

   The following terms will be used throughout this document: 

   End-to-End - This is described as two or more elements utilized for 
   initiating a request, receiving the request, and responding to the 
   request.  It encompasses elements as necessary to be involved in a 
   session dialog between the originating UAC, destination UAS, and any 
   interim proxies (may also include B2BUA's). This may be relative to a 
   single operator's set of elements or extend to encompass all elements 
   (if beyond a single operator's network) associated with a session. 

   Time Begin (TB) - This is the time stamp to begin determination of 
   the duration until the relative response is received.  This begins

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics      August 2006 
 
 
   when the relative request has been processed by the application and 
   is being sent from the proxy or UA. 

   Time Stop (TS) - This is the time stamp to end determination of the 
   duration relative to the necessary response received by the initiator 
   of the request.  This ends when the application recognizes the 
   response. 

3. SIP Performance Metrics 

   The following metrics may be utilized for many different SIP 
   applications.  In regards to all of the following metrics, message 
   re-transmissions must be excluded in order to provide accurate metric 
   results.   

   Some metrics are calculated based on the final response message.  
   These metrics do not take into consideration route advances to 
   additional signaling functions based on "final" failure responses.  
   In these unique cases, the final response related to the initial 
   setup attempt should be utilized for input to the metric. 

    
3.1. Registration Request Delay (RRD) 

   Registration Request Delay is utilized to detect failures or 
   impairments causing delays in responding to a UAC REGISTER request.  
   RRD is measured for both successful and failed REGISTER requests.  
   This metric is measured from the originating UAC perspective as 
   relative to the end-to-end network under measurement.  The output 
   value of this metric is numerical and should be adjusted to indicate 
   seconds and/or milliseconds.  The following represents the 
   calculation for this metric: 

   RRD = Time of Final Response - Time of REGISTER Request 

   This metric is commonly calculated as an average.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 

          SUM (Time of Final Response - Time of REGISTER Request) 
   ARRD = ------------------------------------------------------- 
                        SUM # of REGISTER Requests 
    
3.1.1. Successful REGISTER Completion RRD 

   In a successful registration attempt, RRD is defined as the time 
   interval from the moment the initial REGISTER message containing the 
   necessary information is passed by the originating UAC to the 
   intended registrar until the 200OK is received indicating the 
   registration attempt has completed successfully.  This dialog

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics      August 2006 
 
 
   includes an expected authentication challenge prior to receiving the 
   200OK as describe in the following registration flow examples. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating RRD during a successful 
   registration completion:  
      
               UA1                 Registrar 
                |                      | 
                |REGISTER              | 
         TB---->|--------------------->| 
            /\  |                   401| 
            ||  |<---------------------| 
           RRD  |REGISTER              | 
            ||  |--------------------->| 
            \/  |                   200| 
         TS---->|<---------------------| 
                |                      | 

3.1.2. Failed REGISTER Attempt RRD 

   In a failed registration attempt, the interval is defined from the 
   initial REGISTER request and the final response indicating a failure 
   received from the destination registrar or interim proxies.  A 
   failure response is described as a 4XX, 5XX, or possible 6XX message.  
   RRD may be used to detect problems in downstream signaling functions, 
   which may be impairing the REGISTER message from reaching the 
   intended registrar. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating RRD during a failed registration 
   attempt:  
      
               UA1                Registrar 
                |                      | 
                |REGISTER              | 
         TB---->|--------------------->| 
            /\  |                   401| 
            ||  |<---------------------| 
           RRD  |REGISTER              | 
            ||  |--------------------->| 
            \/  |                   401| 
         TS---->|<---------------------| 
                |                      |

3.2. Session Request Delay (SRD) 

   Session Request Delay is utilized to detect failures or impairments 
   causing delays in responding to a UA session request.  SRD is 
   measured for both successful and failed session setup requests.  This 
   metric is also known as Post Dial Delay (PDD) in telephony 
   applications of SIP.  This metric is measured from the originating 
   UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-to-end network under 
   measurement.  The output value of this metric is numerical and should 
   be adjusted to indicate seconds and/or milliseconds.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric: 

   SRD = Time of Status Indicative Response - Time of INVITE 

   This metric is commonly calculated as an average.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 
           
          SUM (Time of Status Indicative Response - Time of INVITE) 
   ASRD = --------------------------------------------------------- 
                          SUM # of INVITE Requests 

3.2.1. Successful Session Setup SRD 

   In a successful request attempt, SRD is defined as the time interval 
   from the moment the INVITE message containing the necessary 
   information is passed by the originating agent or user to the 
   intended mediation or destination agent until the first provisional 
   response is received indicating an audible or visual status of the 
   initial session request.  In SIP, the message indicating status would 
   be a non-100 Trying provisional message received in response to an 
   INVITE request.  In some cases, a non-100 Trying provisional message 
   is not received, but rather a 200 message is received as the first 
   status message instead.  In these situations, the 200 message would 
   be used to calculate the interval. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SRD during a successful session 
   setup without a redirect (i.e. 3XX message):

   necessary for inputs in calculating SRD during a successful session 
   setup with a redirect (e.g. 302 Moved Temporarily):

3.2.2. Failed Session Setup SRD 

   In a failed request attempt, the interval is defined from the initial 
   session request and a non-100 Trying provisional message or a failure 
   indication response.  A failure response is described as a 4XX, 5XX, 
   or possible 6XX message.  SRD may be used to detect problems in 
   downstream signaling functions, which may be impairing the INVITE 
   message from reaching the intended UA. 

   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in calculating SRD during a failed session setup 
   attempt without a redirect (i.e. 3XX message):

3.3. Session Completion Delay (SCD) 

   This metric is utilized to detect failures or impairments delaying 
   the time necessary to end a session.  SCD is measured for both 
   successful and failed session completions.  This metric is measured 
   from the originating UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-
   to-end network under measurement. The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate seconds and/or 
   milliseconds.  The following represents the calculation for this 
   metric: 

   SCD = Time of 2XX or Timeout - Time of Completion Message (BYE) 

   This metric is commonly calculated as an average.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average:

3.3.2. Failed session completion SCD 

   In some cases, no response is received after a session completion 
   message is sent and potentially retried.  In this case, SCD is 
   defined as the interval between sending a session completion message, 
   such as a BYE, and the resulting Timer F expiration.  The following 
   flow provides an example of identifiable events necessary for inputs 
   in calculating SCD during a failed session completion attempt:

3.4. Average Hops per INVITE (AHI) 

   This metric is used to indicate potential inefficient routing and to 
   detect failure occurrences related to the number of elements 
   traversed by a single SIP INVITE.  AHI is defined as the number of 
   hops traversed by an INVITE.  It is calculated as an average.  This 
   metric requires the Max-Forwards value to be captured at both the 
   originating UAC or proxy and the terminating UAS or proxy perspective 
   as relative to the end-to-end network under measurement.  The output 
   value of this metric is measured in a numerical value indicating a 
   number of hops. 

   Variables = 

      a = Initial INVITE "Max-Forwards" value 

      b = Initial INVITE received by terminating UAS "Max-Forwards"         
   value 

      c = # of Hops for INVITE requests 

      d = SUM # of INVITE requests

3.5. Session Duration Time (SDT) 

   This metric is used to detect problems (e.g. poor audio quality) 
   causing short session durations.  SDT is measured for both successful 
   and failed session completions.  This metric is also known as Call 
   Hold Time, and is traditionally calculated as Average Call Hold Time 
   (ACHT) in telephony applications of SIP.  This metric is measured 
   from the originating UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-
   to-end network under measurement.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate minutes and seconds.  
   The following represents the calculation for this metric: 

   SDT = Time of BYE or Timeout - Time of 200 OK response to INVITE 

   This metric is commonly calculated as an average.  The following 
   represents the calculation for this metric as an average: 
            
        SUM (Time of BYE or Timeout - Time of 200 OK response to INVITE) 
   ASDT = -------------------------------------------------------------- 
                  SUM # of INVITE w/ 200OK & BYE or Timeout 

3.5.1. Successful session completion SDT 

   In a successful session completion, SDT is calculated as an average 
   and is defined as the duration of a dialog from receipt of a 200 OK 
   response to an INVITE and an associated BYE message indicating dialog 
   completion.

3.6. Session Establishment Rate (SER) 

    
   This metric is used to detect the ability of a terminating UA to 
   successfully establish sessions per INVITE request.  SER is defined 
   as the number of INVITE requests resulting in a 200 OK response, to 
   the total number of attempted INVITE requests.  This metric is also 
   known as Answer Seizure Rate (ASR) in telephony applications of SIP.  
   The input variables for this metric are captured from the originating 
   UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-to-end network under 
   measurement.  The output value of this metric is numerical and should 
   be adjusted to indicate a percentage (likely a fractional percentage) 
   of successfully established sessions.  The following represents the 
   calculation for this metric: 
       
         # of INVITE Requests w/ associated 200OK 
   SER = ---------------------------------------- 
               Total # of INVITE Requests 
    
   The following flow provides an example of identifiable events 
   necessary for inputs in determining session establishment as

3.7. Session Defects (SD) 

   Session defects provide a subset of SIP failure responses, which 
   consistently indicate a failure in dialog processing.  Defects are 
   necessary to provide input to calculations such as Defects per 
   Million (DPM) or other similar metrics.  These failure responses are 
   in response to initial session setup requests, such as a new INVITE.  
   The input variables for this metric are captured from the originating 
   UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-to-end network under 
   measurement.  The output value of this metric is numerical and should 
   be adjusted to indicate a percentage (likely a fractional percentage) 
   of defective sessions.  The following failure responses provide a 
   guideline for defective criterion:

Internet-Draft      SIP End-to-End Performance Metrics      August 2006 
 
 
     . 500 Server Internal Error 

     . 503 Service Unavailable 

     . 504 Server Timeout 

   This set of failure responses was derived through correlating more 
   granular ISUP failure responses as described in RFC 3398. 

3.8. Ineffective Session Attempts (ISA) 

   Ineffective session attempts occur when a proxy or agent internally 
   releases a setup request with a failed or congested condition. This 
   metric is also known as Ineffective Machine Attempts (IMA) in 
   telephony applications of SIP, and was adopted from Telcordia GR-512-
   CORE [7]. The input variables for this metric are captured from the 
   originating UAC or proxy perspective as relative to the end-to-end 
   network under measurement.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage (likely a 
   fractional percentage) of ineffective session attempts.  The 
   following failure responses provide a guideline for this criterion: 

     . 408 Request Timeout 

     . 500 Server Internal Error 

     . 503 Service Unavailable 

     . 504 Server Timeout 

   This set was derived in a similar manner as described in Section 3.6, 
   in addition 408 failure responses is indicative a congested state 
   with a downstream element. 

   This metric is calculated as a percentage of total session setup 
   requests.  The following represents the calculation for this metric: 

                   # of ISA  
   ISA % = -----------------------------  
            Total # of Session Requests 

3.9. Session Disconnect Failures (SDF) 

   Session disconnect failures occur when an active session is 
   terminated due to a failure condition that can be identified by a 
   REASON header [5] in a BYE message.  This occurs, for example, when a 
   user agent (UA) is controlling an IP or TDM (Time Division 
   Multiplexing) media gateway, and the media gateway notifies the UA of 
   a failure condition causing the loss of media related to an

   established session.  The UA will release the session with a BYE, but 
   should include a REASON header indicating the session was 
   disconnected abnormally.  The REASON value is utilized to determine 
   the disconnect was a failure.  This metric is also known as Cutoff 
   Calls (CC) in telephony applications of SIP, and was adopted from 
   Telcordia GR-512-CORE [7].  The input variables for this metric are 
   captured from the originating UAC or proxy perspective as relative to 
   the end-to-end network under measurement.  The output value of this 
   metric is numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage 
   (likely a fractional percentage) of session disconnect failures. 

   This metric is calculated as a percentage of total session completed 
   successfully as defined in Section 3.5.  The following represents the 
   calculation for this metric: 

                                    
                     # of SDF's 
   SDF % = -------------------------------  
             Total # of Session Requests 

3.10. Session Completion Rate (SCR) 

   A session completion is defined as a SIP dialog, which completes 
   without failing due to a lack of response from an intended proxy or 
   UA.  A session completes successfully when it begins with a setup 
   request and ends with a session completion message.  This metric is 
   only used when at least one proxy is involved in the dialog.  This 
   metric is also known as Call Completion Rate (CCR) in telephony 
   applications of SIP.  The input variables for this metric are 
   captured from the originating UAC or proxy perspective as relative to 
   the end-to-end network under measurement.  The output value of this 
   metric is numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage 
   (likely a fractional percentage) of successfully completed sessions. 

   The following dialog [4] provides an example describing the necessary 
   events of a successful session completion:

   This metric is calculated as a percentage of total sessions completed 
   successfully.  The following represents the calculation for this 
   metric: 

            # of Successfully Completed Sessions  
   SCR % = ---------------------------------------  
                  Total # of Session Requests      
 
3.11. Session Success Rate (SSR) 

   Session success rate is defined as the percentage of successfully 
   completed sessions compared to sessions, which fail due to ISA or 
   SDF.  This metric is also known as Call Success Rate (CSR) in 
   telephony applications of SIP.  The output value of this metric is 
   numerical and should be adjusted to indicate a percentage of 
   successful sessions.  The following represents the calculation for 
   this metric: 

   SSR = 100% - (ISA% + SDF%) 

4. Metric Correlations 

   These metrics may be used to determine the performance of a domain 
   and/or user.  This would be to provide a metric relative to one or 
   more dimensions.  The following is a subset of dimensions for 
   providing further granularity per metric: 

        . To "user" 

        . From "user" 

        . Bi-direction "user" 

        . To "domain" 

        . From "domain" 

        . Bi-direction "domain" 

   Example: The SCR of SIP domain A is 99.97%.

5. Additional Considerations 

5.1. Back-to-back User Agent (B2BUA) Considerations 

   A B2BUA may impact the ability to collect these metrics with an end-
   to-end perspective.  It is necessary to realize a B2BUA may act as an 
   originating UAC and terminating UAS or it may act as a proxy.  In 
   some cases, it may be necessary to consider information collected 
   from both sides of the B2BUA in order to determine the end-to-end 
   perspective.  In other cases, the B2BUA may act simply as a proxy 
   allowing data to be derived as necessary for the input into any of 
   the listed calculations. 

5.2. Data Collection Considerations 

   The input necessary for these calculations may be collected in a 
   number of different manners.  It may be collected or retrieved from 
   call detail records (CDR) or raw signaling information generated by a 
   proxy or UA.  When using records, time synchronization must be 
   considered between applicable elements. 

   The information may also be transmitted through use of SNMP traps as 
   described in the work in progress SIP MIB draft [6], or through a 
   potential undefined new performance metric event package [3] 
   retrieved via SUBSCRIBE requests. 

   Data may be collected for a sample of calls or all calls, and may 
   also be derived from test call scenarios.  These metrics are flexible 
   based on the needs of the application. 

5.3. Testing Documentation 

   In some cases, these metrics will be used to provide output values to 
   signify the performance level of a specific SIP-based element.  When 
   using these metrics in a test environment, the environment must be 
   accurately documented for the purposes of replicating any output 
   values in future testing and/or validation. 

6. Security Considerations 

   Security should be considered in the aspect of securing the relative 
   data utilized in providing input to the above calculations.  All 
   other aspects of security should be considered as described in [2].   

7. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations at this time.

8. Conclusions 

   The proposed guideline provides a description of common performance 
   metrics, and their defined use with SIP.  The use of these metrics 
   will provide a common viewpoint across all vendors, service 
   providers, and customers.  These metrics will likely be utilized in 
   production SIP environments for providing input regarding Key 
   Performance Indicators (KPI) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) 
   indications; however, they may also be used for testing end-to-end 
   SIP-based service environments.
