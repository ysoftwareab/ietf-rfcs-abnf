Internet-Draft        Conveying CPC using the SAML             July 2006


1.  Introduction

   SS7 ISUP [8] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) and Originating
   Line Information (OLI) parameters that characterizes the station used
   to originate the call and carries other important state that can
   describe the originating party.  CPC and OLI are widely deployed in
   ISUP network and used to alter the handling of the messages, such as
   prioritizing etc.

   CPC and OLI characterize the originating party.  The information
   carried in CPC or OLI may not be privacy sensitive, but needs to be
   trustworthy enough for the receiving party to make an appropriate
   policy decision on how to handle the call.  This is especially
   important when CPC and OLI are to be carried using the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2].  For example, the receiving party may
   preempt other calls to prioritize the target call or to allow access
   to resources depending on the information carried in CPC or OLI.

   The use case of asserting parameters, such as CPC and OLI, and to
   make them available to other parties to make decisions is termed as
   "trait-based authorization" (see [7]).  The Security Assertion Markup
   Language (SAML) [5] seems to be promising solution to convey CPC and
   OLI in SIP.

   This draft explores the applicability of "SAML HTTP-URI-Based SIP
   Binding" (SHUSB) defined in the "SIP SAML Profile and Binding"
   document [3] for conveying CPC and OLI.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   Additionally, the following terms are used:

   Calling Party Category: Calling Party Category is an attribute of a
   caller that characterizes the caller.  It generally represents an
   organization caller is associated with.  (Police, Operator etc.)

   Asserting Party: An asserting Party is an entity, which by some means
   authorize and authenticate the target for an assertion and it is an
   entity that will verify the assertion when recipient of an assertion
   inquires about the assertion's validity.

   Assertion: An assertion is an XML document that contains
   authentication statements, attribute statements and authorization

   decision statements.  In an authentication statement, an issuing
   authority asserts that a certain subject was authenticated by certain
   means at a certain time.  In an attribute statement, an issuing
   authority asserts that a certain subject is associated with certain
   attributes which has certain values.  In an authorization decision
   statement, a certain subject with a certain access type to certain
   resource has given certain evidence that the identity is correct.
   The assertion is digitally signed to protect it against unwanted
   modifications by third parties.


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  ACR Override

   A User Agent Server (UAS), a proxy and other servers might have
   Anonymous Call Rejection (ACR) service enabled that rejects incoming
   calls when they are anonymous.  The same entity that has ACR service
   enabled might have a local policy, by which upon receiving a call
   with a specific CPC value such as "police", it would allow the call
   to go through even when the caller is identified as anonymous, by
   overriding the ACR service.

3.2.  Call-back from Law Enforcement

   A Voice Service Provider/Application Sercice Provider might have a
   local policy to return an AoR of their subscriber by overriding their
   general privacy policy when it is requested from an organization with
   an appropriate CPC value (e.g., Police, PSAP etc.).  This might be
   useful for example when PSAP which had received an anonymous call
   that was disconnected and need to make a call-back to complete the
   dispatch.

3.3.  PSTN Interaction

   CPC and OLI in ISUP message can be mapped to CPC and OLI attributes
   defined here in this draft for interconnecting SIP networks and ISUP
   networks.

3.4.  Call Prioritization

   Intermediaries on the signaling path might prioritize the call
   according to the value carried in CPC.  For example, if the call is
   from the police and the call is tagged with the CPC value set to
   "police", the intermediaries on the signaling path might alter the
   routing to prioritize the call or preempt other calls to ensure that
   the call reaches the target party.

4.  SHUSB Solution Discussion

   SHUSB has drastically simplified the way SAML is used in SIP by
   defining a "mediated" authentication architecture where
   Authentication Service (AS) also acts as a SAML Authority (Asserting
   Party).  The profile also eliminated various ways of obtaining and
   conveying SAML assertion by limiting the model used to "PULL Model"
   alone.

   This simplification although beneficial when used in context of end-
   to-end SAML usage raises some performance questions when CPC is to be
   conveyed using the SHUSB and consumed by intermediaries.

4.1.  Assertion's Presence

   SHUSB reuses the SIP-Identity [4] and the Identity-Info header as a
   placeholder to hold the reference to the SAML assertion.  Because the
   Identity-Info header permits reference to either a public certificate
   of the domain or to the SAML assertion, it is non-deterministic
   whether a SAML assertion is available at the URI referenced in the
   Identity-Info header.  This indeterminacy of assertion's presence
   will cause verifier/consumer to attempt fetching the document even if
   there is no SAML assertion present at the URI.

4.2.  Assertion's Contents

   Currently SHUSB does not define a way to represents what information
   SAML assertion will contain.  One can only find out by fetching the
   document.

   As intermediaries along the signaling path are supposed to consume
   the SAML assertion if CPC is to be carried using SAML, increase in
   number of intermediaries along the signaling path can cause
   unnecessary processing on each of the intermediaries fetching the
   SAML assertion and results in additional call setup delay.

4.3.  Extra Round Trips

   SHUSB requires consuming/verifying entity whether it's a proxy or an
   UAS to use HTTP or HTTPS to fetch the SAML assertion referenced in
   SIP-Identity header.

   With the increased number of intermediaries along the signaling path,
   which need to process the SAML assertion, the call setup delay
   increases due to the round trips required by each proxy to
   dereference the URI reference to a SAML assertion.

5.  Possible Solutions

   Section 4 described a few challenges when using the currently
   specified SHUSB for CPC and OLI. conveyance There is, however, room
   for improvement.  This section provides a number of alternatives and
   lists their advantages and disadvantages.

5.1.  Content Indicator

   Two of the issues realized in the previous sections were related to
   uncertainty of the contents at the URI provided through Identity-Info
   header.

   This may be solved by defining a parameter that can be used along
   with the URI in the Identity-Info header to indicate the presence of
   SAML assertion Furthermore, an indicator to hint the type of
   information that is contained in the SAML assertion might be useful
   as well.

   As an example, the SAML Attribute Profiles listed in Section 8 of [6]
   provide an identification of the attributes.  This allows to group
   several attributes to an application (e.g.,
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:attribute:DCE identifier for DCE
   PAC information).

   Pros:
      The SAML assertion will only be fetched when the content of the
      SAML assertion is believed to be useful by the entity handling the
      call.
      The SAML assertion will only be fetched when there is a SAML
      assertion at the URI presented in Identity-Info header.
      Requires no extensions on UAC.

   Cons:
      Call setup delay anticipated due to the nature of "Pull Model" is
      not resolved.

5.2.  New SIP SAML Profile

   To solve the third issue presented in the previous section, defining
   an additional SIP SAML profile that would allow the SAML assertion to
   be carried by-value in the SIP header may be considered.
      Note: It is assumed that asserting party is played by the
      Authentication Service and SIP-Identity is still used to provide
      the integrity protection over request, and the same key is used
      for signing SAML assertion and Identity header.

Internet-Draft        Conveying CPC using the SAML             July 2006


5.2.1.  By-Value in Body

   As the SAML assertion can become quite large, logical means to carry
   the SAML assertion would be to carry it in the message body.

   Pros:
      Once the public key of the asserting domain is obtained, no extra
      round trip will be necessary at the consuming/verifying party.

   Cons:
      S/MIME cannot be used when intermediaries need to consume/verify
      the SAML assertion and the SAML assertion is placed in the body.
      (Although end-2-middle security [8] may be used.)
      Requires extension on UAC to support the fetching and inclusion of
      SAML assertion.

5.2.2.  By-Value in Header

   Another approach would be to include the SAML assertion in the
   header.  By including the header field that carries SAML assertion to
   be part of the target header for calculating the hash for Identity
   header, integrity of the SAML assertion can be achieved and many of
   the security threats anticipated by the inclusion in the header is
   eliminated.

   Pros:
      S/MIME can be used for end-to-end encryption of body.
      Requires no extensions on the UAC.
      Once the public key of the asserting domain is obtained, no extra
      round trip will be necessary at the consuming/verifying entity.

   Cons:
      Increase in the header size.


6.  Call Flow Examples

   URI reference by intermediaries on the signaling path when SHUSB is

6.2.  By-Value in Body

   The following call flow shows a basic retrieval of an assertion/
   artifact by intermediaries on the signaling path with SAML assertion
   in the message body.

   As shown in the figure, UAC needs to retrieve the artifact before
   establishing the call.

11.  Example

   This section presents an example SAML assertion.  Figure X, the
   assertion is attesting with respect to the subject (lines 7-15)
   "Alice@example.com" (line 11).  The validity conditions are expressed
   in lines 16-23, via both a validity period expressed as temporal
   endpoints, and an "audience restriction" stating that this
   assertion's semantics are valid for only the relying party named
   "example2.com".  Also, the assertion's issuer is noted in lines 4-5.
   The authentication statement in lines 24-30 indicate that the issuer
   is attesting to having authenticated the subject using the mechanism
   denoted in the > AuthnContext < element.  Lines 31-37 provide
   information about the Originating Line Indication (OLI) stating that
   the calling station is a pay phone.

12.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of SIP-SAML are fully applicable t this

   document.  Additionally, the requirements outlined in [7] are
   relevant.


13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register two URNs, to create two registries for
   the CPC and OLI and to register a number of tokens.

13.1.  CPC and OLI Registry

   This document instructs IANA to register a registry for CPC and for
   OLI tokens.The OLI tokens are listed in Section 7 starting with
   'payphone' and finishing with 'cellular-roaming'.  The CPC tokens are
   listed in Section 8 starting with 'payphone' and finishing with
   'operator'.  Following the policies outline in RFC 2434 [2], new
   tokens are assigned after Expert Review by the Expert Reviewer
   appointed by the IESG.  The same procedure applies to updates of
   tokens within the registry and to deleting tokens from the registry.
   The expert review should be guided by a few common-sense
   considerations.  The Expert's support of IANA will include providing
   IANA with the new token(s) when the update is provided only in the
   form of a schema, and providing IANA with the new schema element(s)
   when the update is provided only in the form of a token.  Each
   registration must include the name of the token and a brief
   description similar to the ones offered in for the initial
   registrations contained this document: Token Identifier: Identifier
   of the token.  Description: Brief description indicating the meaning
   of the token, including one or more examples where the term
   encompasses several more precise terms.

14.  Acknowledgement

   The authors would like to thank Erick Sasaki, Jeff Hodges, Scott
   Cantor and Christian Schmidt for providing constructive feedbacks to
   this draft.


15.  Internationalization Considerations

   The OLI and CPC values listed in this document MUST NOT be presented
   to the user.  The values therefore have the characteristic of tokens
   or tags and no internationalization support is required.
