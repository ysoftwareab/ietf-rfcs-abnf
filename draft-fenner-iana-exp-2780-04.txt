Abstract

   When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary
   to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers
   for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to
   support experimentation has been identified, and describes the
   numbers that have already been reserved by other documents.

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values                April 2006


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3692] recommends assigning option numbers for experiments and
   testing.  This document requests [[anchor2: documents --(when
   assigned)]] such assignments for the number spaces whose IANA
   considerations are documented in [RFC2780].  This document generally
   follows the form of [RFC2780].

   When using these values, carefully consider the advice in Sections 1
   and 1.1 of [RFC3692].  It is not appropriate to simply select one of
   these values and hard code it into a system.

   Note: while [RFC3692] says that it may not be necessary to allocate
   values for UDP and TCP ports, sections 6 and 7.1 explicitly reserve
   ports for this purpose to avoid any possible conflict.


2.  Fields in the IPv4 header

   The IPv4 header [RFC0791] contains the following fields that carry
   values assigned by the IANA: Version, Type of Service, Protocol,
   Source Address, Destination Address, and Option Type.

2.1.  IPv4 IP Version field

   The IPv4 Version field is always 4.

2.2.  IPv4 Type of Service field

   [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 (all code points xxxx11, where 'x' refers to
   either '0' or '1') as Experimental / Local Use, so no additional code
   points should be needed.  The ECN field [RFC3168] has no free code
   points to assign.

2.3.  IPv4 Protocol field

   [RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for
   the IPv4 Protocol field.

2.4.  IPv4 Source and Destination addresses

2.4.1.  IPv4 Unicast

   No experimental IPv4 addresses are defined.  For certain experiments,
   the address ranges set aside for Private Internets in [RFC1918] may
   be useful.  It is not appropriate to use other special-purpose IPv4
   addresses [RFC3330] for experimentation.

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values                April 2006


2.4.2.  IPv4 Multicast

   The globally routable group 224.0.1.20 is set aside for
   experimentation.  For certain experiments, the administratively
   scoped multicast groups defined in [RFC2365] may be useful.  This
   document assigns a single link-local scoped group, 224.0.0.TBD, and a
   single scope-relative group, TBD.

2.5.  IPv4 Option Type field

   This document assigns a single option number, with all defined values
   of the "copy" and "class" fields, resulting in four distinct option
   type codes.  See Section 8 for the assigned values.


3.  Fields in the IPv6 header

   The IPv6 header [RFC2460] contains the following fields that carry
   values assigned from IANA-managed name spaces: Version, Traffic
   Class, Next Header, Source and Destination Address.  In addition, the
   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options and Destination Options extension headers
   include an Option Type field with values assigned from an IANA-
   managed name space.

3.1.  IPv6 Version field

   The IPv6 Version field is always 6.

3.2.  IPv6 Traffic Class field

   [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 (all code points xxxx11, where 'x' refers to
   either '0' or '1') as Experimental / Local Use, so no additional code
   points should be needed.  The ECN field [RFC3168] has no free code
   points to assign.

3.3.  IPv6 Next Header field

   [RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for
   the IPv6 Next Header field.

3.4.  IPv6 Source and Destination Addresses

3.4.1.  IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   [RFC2928] defines a set of IPv6 addresses for testing and
   experimental usage:

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values                April 2006


      The block of Sub-TLA IDs assigned to the IANA (i.e., 2001:
      0000::/29 - 2001:01F8::/29) is for assignment for testing and
      experimental usage to support activities such as the 6bone, and
      for new approaches like exchanges.

   However, at this writing, there are no RFC3692-style experimental
   IPv6 addresses assigned.  [I-D.huston-ipv6-iana-specials] creates an
   IANA registry which may in the future contain such assignments.  For
   certain experiments, Unique Local Addresses [RFC4193] may be useful.
   It is not appropriate to use addresses in the documentation prefix
   [RFC3849] for experimentation.

3.4.2.  IPv6 Multicast Addresses

   The group FF0X::114 is set aside for experimentation at all scope
   levels.  Smaller scopes may be particularly useful for
   experimentation, since they are defined not to leak out of a given
   defined boundary which can be set to be the boundary of the
   experiment.  For certain experiments, other multicast addresses with
   the T (non-permanently-assigned or "transient" address) bit [RFC4291]
   set may be useful.

3.5.  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destination Option Fields

   This document assigns a single option type, with all possible values
   of the "act" and "chg" fields, resulting in eight distinct option
   type codes.  See Section 8 for the assigned values.

3.6.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Fields

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery header [RFC2461] contains the following
   fields that carry values assigned from IANA-managed name spaces:
   Type, Code and Option Type.

3.6.1.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Type

   The Neighbor Discovery Type field is the same as the ICMPv6 Type
   field.  See Section 5 for those code points.

3.6.2.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Code

   The ICMPv6 Code field is not used in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, so no
   experimental code points are necessary.

3.6.3.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Type

   This document assigns two IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Types, TBD1
   and TBD2.

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values                April 2006


3.7.  IPv6 Routing Header Routing Type

   This document assignes two values for the Routing Type field in the
   IPv6 Routing Header, TBDY and TBDZ.


4.  Fields in the IPv4 ICMP header

   This document assigns two ICMPv4 type numbers, TBD3 and TBD4.  ICMPv4
   code values are allocated per-type, so it's not feasible to assign
   experimental values in this document.


5.  Fields in the IPv6 ICMP header

   [I-D.ietf-ipngwg-icmp-v3] includes experimental ICMPv6 type values
   for Informational (200, 201) and Error (100, 101) message types.
   ICMPv6 code values are allocated per-type, so it's not feasible to
   assign experimental values in this document.


6.  Fields in the UDP header

   Two system ports, TBD5 and TBD6, have been reserved for
   experimentation for UDP and TCP.


7.  Fields in the TCP header

7.1.  TCP Source and Destination Port fields

   Two system ports, TBD5 and TBD6, have been reserved for
   experimentation for UDP and TCP.

7.2.  Reserved Bits in TCP Header

   There are not enough reserved bits to allocate any for
   experimentation.

7.3.  TCP Option Kind field

   Two TCP options, TBD7 and TBD8, have been reserved for
   experimentation with TCP Options.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The new assignments are summarized below.

   Each of these registrations should be accompanied by the following
   footnote:

   *  It is only appropriate to use these values in explicitly-
      configured experiments; they MUST NOT be shipped as defaults in
      implementations.  See RFC 3692 for details.


9.  Security Considerations

   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection
   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields
   described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,
   existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may
   fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity if the analyzer
   declines to forward the unrecognized traffic, or loss of security if
   it does forward the traffic and the new values are used as part of an
   attack.  Assigning known values for experiments can allow such
   analyzers to take a known action for explicitly experimental traffic.

   Because the experimental IPv4 options defined in Section 2.5 are not
   included in the IPsec AH [RFC4302] calculations, it is not possible
   for one to authenticate their use.  Experimenters ought to keep this
   in mind when designing their experiments.  Users of the experimental
   IPv6 options defined in Section 3.5 can choose whether or not the
   option is included in the AH calculations by choosing the value of
   the "chg" field.

   When experimental code points are deployed within an administratively
   self-contained network domain, the network administrators should
   ensure that each code point is used consistently to avoid
   interference between experiments.  When experimental code points are
   used in traffic that crosses multiple adminstrative domains, the
   experimenters should assume that there is a risk of the same code
   points being used simultaneously by other experiments and thus that
   there is a possibility that the experiments will interfere.
   Particular attention should be given to security threats that such
   interference might create.
