   A later version of this draft, file name draft-ietf-trade-iotp-v1.0-
   protocol-01.txt, is intended to become an Informational RFC.
   Distribution of this document is unlimited.  Comments should be sent
   to the TRADE WG mailing list <ietf-trade@eListX.com>.

   This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months.  Internet-Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by
   other documents at any time.  It is not appropriate to use Internet-
   Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a
   ``working draft'' or ``work in progress.''

   Rim), ftp.ietf.org (US East Coast), or ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast).

   Technical control over the Internet Open Trading Protocol is being
   transfered to the IETF TRADE working group from the OTP Consortium.
   In some cases, the most current version of techncial documents is an
   OTP Consortium version that has not yet been republished as an RFC
   and is available from <http://www.otp.org> web site (which has not
   yet been fully updates to indicate the technical switch to the IETF).

INTERNET-DRAFT                 IOTP V1.0                  September 1998


Abstract

   The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) provides an interoperable
   framework for Internet commerce.  It is payment system independent
   and can encapsulates a variety of payment systems. IOTP is able to
   handle cases where such merchant roles as the shopping site, the
   payment handler, the delivery handler of goods or services, and the
   provider of customer care are performed by different parties or by
   one party.

   [This draft is a place holder for an internet-draft version of the
   v1.0 starting point for the trade working group.]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 IOTP V1.0                  September 1998


1. Place Holder

   Technical control over the Internet Open Trading Protocol is being
   transfered to the IETF TRADE working group from the OTP Consortium.
   In some cases, the most current version of technical documents is an
   OTP Consortium version that has not yet been republished as an RFC
   and is available from <http://www.otp.org> web site (which has not
   yet been fully updates to indicate the technical switch to the IETF).

   In this case, see
   <http://www.otp.org/otp/Home.nsf/f86055a20977be50862564b3004d010a/
   42b496239c5956aa8625655a007b1835/$FILE/OTP_Spec_v_0-9-9_ltr.pdf>.  It
   is intended that that document be appropriately reformated / edited
   and published as an later verson of this internet-draft and then as
   an Informational RFC.



2. Security Considerations

   Security of Internet Open Trade Protocol messages is primarily
   dependent on signatures within IOTP as described in [v0.9.9].

   Note that the security of payment protocols transported by IOTP is
   the responsibility of those payment protocols.
