1.  Introduction

   This document describes GMPLS signaling extensions for configuring a
   FlexE group and adding or removing FlexE client(s) to a FlexE group
   [OIFFLEXE1].  The various usecases that arise when transporting
   Flexible Rate Ethernet signals in Optical transport networks are
   described in [FLEXEUSECASES].  The routing extensions in support of
   carrying link state information for a FlexE group are described in
   [FLEXEROUTING].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   a.  Ethernet PHY: an entity representing 100G-R Physical Coding
       Sublayer (PCS), Physical Media Attachment (PMA), and Physical
       Media Dependent (PMD) layers.

   b.  FlexE Group: a group of from 1 to 254 bonded Ethernet PHYs.

   c.  FlexE Client: an Ethernet flow based on a MAC data rate that may
       or may not correspond to any Ethernet PHY rate (e.g., 10, 40, m x
       25 Gb/s).

   d.  FlexE Shim: the layer that maps or demaps the FlexE clients
       carried over a FlexE group.

   e.  FlexE Calendar: Representation of a FlexE group of n PHYs as a
       calendar of 20n slots logical length with 20 slots per PHY for
       scheduling of slots (i.e., a PHY bandwidth) among the FlexE
       clients.

3.  Protocol Extensions

   This section describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for GMPLS
   [RFC3473] to support FlexE.

3.1.  Generalized Label

   Figure 1 shows the proposed FlexE generalized label format to be
   carried in the Generalized Label Request [RFC3471].  This document
   proposes LSP Encoding type = Flexible Ethernet (FlexE) (a new value
   of 15 as defined in [FLEXEROUTING]), Switching type = Layer-2 Switch
   Capable (L2SC) (a value of 51 as defined in [RFC3471]) and
   Generalized PID (G-PID) = FlexE (a new value of 71 as defined in this
   document).  A FlexE Group consists of 1 to n 100GBASE-R Ethernet
   PHYs.  The label lists all PHY numbers (1 to 254) that are members of
   the FlexE group.  For a client, the label also lists calendar slots
   in each member PHY that are assigned to the client.

      FlexE Group Number (20 bits) fields allows to check that the
      correct PHY is being received from the correct group number
      [OIFFLEXE1].

      Client (16 bits) field indicates which of the FlexE clients is
      mapped into a given calendar slot in the A and B calendar
      configurations for the sub-calendar carried over that PHY
      [OIFFLEXE1].

      Flags (8 bits) field is reserved for future use.  [OIFFLEXE1].

      PHY Number (8 bits) field is used to identify PHY by a number in
      the 1-254 range [OIFFLEXE1].

      Rate (8 bits) field is used to specify rate of the given PHY
      number.  Currently [OIFFLEXE1] has defined a 100G PHY rate.  In
      the future, this field may be used to indicate other PHY rates
      (e.g., 400G).

      Granularity (8 bits) field is used to indicate granularity of the
      FlexE calendar.  Currently [OIFFLEXE1] has defined 5G granularity.
      In future, this field can have additional values, as further
      granularity are defined.

      Slot Map (20 bits) field is used to indicate which calendar slots
      of the associated PHY number is assigned to a given FlexE client.
      For a PHY with a rate of 100G and granularity of 5G, the slot map
      consists of 20 slots (0-19 range).  In the future, when other PHY
      rates and/or calender granularities are defined, the slot map size
      for a PHY can be derived based on the Rate and Granularity fields
      values.

      Unavailable Slots (8 bits) field is used to indicate the number of
      unavailable calendar slots (0-19 range) for example due to
      transport network constraints (i.e., no FlexE client should be
      assigned to the unused slots).  Unavailable slots are placed at
      the end of each relevant sub-calendar (i.e., the highest numbered
      slots) [OIFFLEXE1].

3.2.  FlexE Group Initial Setup

   Suppose it is desired to establish a FlexE group containing two 100G
   PHYs between node A and B.  This can be accomplished by having node A
   send a RSVP-TE message containing a FlexE generalized label to node B
   with the following field values:

   a.  FlexE Group Number = 100 (say), Client = 0x0000 (i.e., no client)




Hussain, et al.          Expires January 8, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               FlexE Signaling                   July 2016


   b.  First PHY Number = 5 (say), Rate= 100G, Granularity=5G,
       Unavailable Slots=0, Slot Map = 0-19 bit set to 0 (i.e., all
       slots available)

   c.  Second PHY Number = 7 (say), Rate-100G, Granularity=5G,
       Unavailable Slots=0, Slot Map = 0-19 bit set to 0 (i.e., all
       slots available)

   Thus both ends will have the same FlexE group configuration and the
   FlexE group can be brought in service.

3.3.  FlexE Client Setup

   Suppose it is desired to establish a FlexE client of rate 50G node A
   and B to the FlexE group created in the Section 3.2.  This can be
   accomplished by having node A send a RSVP-TE message containing a
   FlexE generalized label to node B with the following field values:

   a.  FlexE Group Number = 100, Client = 0x0001 (i.e., client id = 1)

   b.  First PHY Number = 5 , Rate= 100G, Granularity=5G, Unavailable
       Slots=0, Slot Map = 0 to 4 bit set to 1 (i.e., 25G on this PHY)

   c.  Second PHY Number = 7, Rate-100G, Granularity=5G, Unavailable
       Slots=0, Slot Map = 0 to 4 bit set to 1 (i.e., 25G on this PHY)

3.4.  Related Work

   The generalized label described in [FLEXESIGNAL] is limited to 100G
   PHY only.  In contrast, the generalized label proposed in this
   document is extendible to PHY rates beyond 100G.  Specifically, the
   label proposed in this document introduces additional per PHY fields,
   namely, Rate and Granularity.  This enables to drive per PHY calendar
   size information in the face of calendar granularity and/or calendar
   size changes that might be required for PHY rates beyond 100G (such
   as 400G).
