                       Status of this Memo

 This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
 documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its
 areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also
 distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

 Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
 months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
 documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-
 Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as
 ``work in progress.''

 This memo provides information for the Internet community. This'
 memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind, since
 this document is mainly a compilation of information taken from
 other RFC-s.. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

                           Abstract

This memo contains a table of commonly occurring attributes in
headings and on envelopes of e-mail messages. The document compiles
information from other RFC-s such as RFC 821, RFC 822, RFC 1036,
RFC 1327, RFC 1496, RFC 1521, RFC 1766 and X.400. A few commonly
occurring attributes which are not defined in RFC-s are also
included. For each attribute, the memo gives a short description
and a reference to the RFC or X.400 part, in which the attribute
is defined.

                        1. Introduction

Many different Internet standards and RFC-s define attributes which
may occur on Internet Mail Messages and Network News Articles. The
intention of this document is to list all such attributes in one
document as an aid to people developing message systems or interested
in Internet Mail standards.

The document contains all heading attributes which the author has
found in the following Internet standards: RFC 821 [1], RFC 822 [2],
RFC 1036 [3], RFC 1327 [4], RFC 1496 [5], RFC 1521 [6] and
RFC 1766 [8]. Note in particular that heading attributes defined in
RFC 1421-1424, "Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail",
are not included. A few additional attributes which often can be
found in e-mail headings are also included.

For each heading attribute, the document gives a short description and
a reference to the Internet standard or RFC, in which they are defined.
Information about corresponding attributes in X.400 is also given
when available.

                2. Use of gatewaying attributes

RFC 1327 defines a number of new attributes in Internet mail, which
are defined to map attributes which X.400 have but which were
previously not standardized in Internet mail. Some of these attributes
are obviously useful also as stand-alone Internet mail message
attributes. The fact that an attribute occurs in RFC 1327 indicates
that it is recommended for use in gatewaying messages between X.400

and Internet mail, but does not necessarily mean that the attribute
is recommended for messages wholly within Internet mail. However, some
of these attributes may eventually get accepted also for usage within
Internet mail.

Fields are given here in the spelling used in e-mail headers. This
may sometimes be English, sometimes American spelling. One attribute,
"Organisation/Organization" occurs in e-mail headers sometimes with
English, sometimes with American spelling.
