1.  Introduction

   This document specifies:
      o the digital signature algorithm and parameters;
      o the hash algorithm and parameters;
      o the public and private key formats; and,
      o the signature format
   used by Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Certification
   Authorities (CA), and BGPsec (Border Gateway Protocol Security)
   speakers (i.e., routers).  CAs use these algorithms when processing
   requests for BGPsec Router Certificates [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-
   profiles].  Examples when BGPsec routers use these algorithms include
   requesting BGPsec certificates [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles], signing
   BGPsec Update messages [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol], and verifying
   BGPsec Update messages [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol].

   This document updates [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis] to add support for a) a
   different algorithm for BGPsec certificate requests, which are issued
   only by BGPsec speakers; b) a different Subject Public Key Info
   format for BGPsec certificates, which is needed for the specified
   BGPsec signature algorithm; and, c) a different signature format for
   BGPsec signatures, which is needed for the specified BGPsec signature
   algorithm.  The BGPsec certificate are differentiated from other RPKI
   certificates by the use of the BGPsec Extended Key Usage defined in
   [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles].

Internet-Draft    BGPsec Algs, Key & Signature Formats    April 21, 2016


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Algorithms

   The algorithms used to compute signatures on CA certificates, BGPsec
   Router Certificates, and CRLs are as specified in Section 2 of
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis].  This section addresses BGPsec algorithms, for
   example these algorithms are used by BGPsec routers to request BGPsec
   certificates, by RPKI CAs to verify BGPsec certification requests, by
   BGPsec routers to generate BGPsec Update messages, and by BGPsec
   routers to verify BGPsec Update message:

     o The signature algorithm used MUST be the Elliptic Curve Digital
       Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with curve P-256 [RFC6090][DSS].

     o The hash algorithm used MUST be SHA-256 [SHS].

   Hash algorithms are not identified by themselves in certificates or
   BGPsec Update messages. They are represented by an OID that combines
   the hash algorithm with the digital signature algorithm as follows:

     o The ecdsa-with-SHA256 OID [RFC5480] MUST appear in the PKCS #10
       signatureAlgorithm field [RFC2986] or in Certificate Request
       Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey algorithm field [RFC4211],
       which location depends on the certificate request format
       generated.

     o In BGPsec Update messages, the ECDSA with SHA-256 Algorithm Suite
       Identifier from Section 7 is included in the Signature-Block
       List's Algorithm Suite Identifier field.

3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats

   The key formats used to compute signatures on CA certificates, BGPsec
   Router Certificates, and CRLs are as specified in Section 3 of
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis].  This section addresses key formats found in
   the BGPsec router certificate requests and in BGPsec Router
   Certificates.

   The ECDSA private keys used to compute signatures for certificate
   requests and BGPsec Update messages MUST come from the P-256 curve
   [RFC5480].  The public key pair MUST use the uncompressed form.

Internet-Draft    BGPsec Algs, Key & Signature Formats    April 21, 2016


3.1.  Public Key Format

   The Subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo
   [RFC5280].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey. 
   The values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:

     o algorithm (an AlgorithmIdentifier type):  The id-ecPublicKey OID
       MUST be used in the algorithm field, as specified in Section
       2.1.1 of [RFC5480].  The value for the associated parameters MUST
       be secp256r1, as specified in Section 2.1.1.1 of [RFC5480].

     o subjectPublicKey:  ECPoint MUST be used to encode the
       certificate's subjectPublicKey field, as specified in Section 2.2
       of [RFC5480].

3.2.  Private Key Format

   Local Policy determines private key format.

4.  Signature Format 

   The structure for the certificate's and CRL's signature field MUST be
   as specified in Section 4 of [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis], which is the same
   format used by other RPKI certificates.  The structure for the
   certification request's and BGPsec Update message's signature field
   MUST be as specified in Section 2.2.3 of [RFC3279].

5.  Additional Requirements

   It is anticipated that BGPsec will require the adoption of updated
   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash algorithms over
   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic
   security. This profile should be updated to specify such future
   requirements, when appropriate.

   The recommended procedures to implement such a transition of key
   sizes and algorithms is specified in [RFC6916].

6.  Security Considerations 

   The Security Considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC5480], [RFC6090],
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis], and [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] apply to
   certificates.  The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC6090],
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis], [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] apply to
   certification requests.  The security considerations of [RFC3279],
   [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol], and [RFC6090] apply to BGPsec Update
   messages.  No new security considerations are introduced as a result
   of this specification.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is requested to define
   the "BGPsec Algorithm Suite Registry" described below in the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) group.

   An algorithm suite consists of a digest algorithm and a signature
   algorithm.  This specification creates an IANA registry of one-octet
   BGPsec algorithm suite identifiers.  Additionally, this document
   registers a single algorithm suite which uses the digest algorithm
   SHA-256 and the signature algorithm ECDSA on the P-256 curve
   [RFC5480].

                     BGPsec Algorithm Suites Registry

         Algorithm    Algorithm     Suite        Pointer
                                    Identifier 

       +-------------------------------------------------------+
       | Reserved   | Reserved    | 0x0        | This draft    |

       | SHA-256    | ECDSA P-256 | TBD        | RFC 5480      |
       +-------------------------------------------------------+
       | Unassigned | Unassigned  | TBD+1..0xE | This draft    |
       +-------------------------------------------------------+
       | Reserved   | Reserved    | 0xF        | This draft    |
       +-------------------------------------------------------+

   Future assignments are to be made using either the Standards Action
   process defined in [RFC5226], or the Early IANA Allocation process
   defined in [RFC7120].  Assignments consist of a digest algorithm
   name, signature algorithm name, and the algorithm suite identifier
   value.
