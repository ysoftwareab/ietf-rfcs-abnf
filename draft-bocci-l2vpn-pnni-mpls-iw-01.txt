   where Provider Edge nodes (PEs) on both sides of an MPLS Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) connect edge ATM networks using the Private
   Network-Network Interface (PNNI)[10] or the ATM Inter-Network
   Interface (AINI) [11].  In this method, ATM signalling and routing
   messages are tunnelled over the PSN using dedicated pseudo wires,
   enabling ATM pseudo wires carrying user traffic to be established and
   release dynamically by ATM.  The method does not require changes to
   existing IETF defined protocols in order to support all features of
   PNNI and AINI.

1.3  Objectives and Scope

   This informative document extends [6] by including mechanisms for
   interworking with attachment circuits that are Asynchronous Transfer
   Mode (ATM)  Soft Permanent Virtual Channels or Soft Permanent Virtual
   Paths (SPVCs/SPVPs) and ATM Switched Virtual Channels or Switched
   Virtual Paths (SVCs/SPVCs) for Multi Protocol Labels Switching (MPLS)
   based Packet Switched Networks (PSNs).

   Service providers are introducing new PSN based networks and are
   looking for a seamless way to extend the reach of existing ATM
   services to new sites attached to this PSN network.  One important
   capability which is used in the existing ATM networks is ATM switched
   services.  These are mainly SPVC services, and to a lesser extent SVC
   services.  SPVC services are critical in today's networks as they
   allow simplified provisioning of the ATM services by configuring the
   endpoints only.  They also allow dynamic traffic engineering and a
   faster restoration in the case of a network failure.  Finally, ATM
   SPVCs extend connectivity to non-ATM endpoints, such as Frame Relay
   and Ethernet, on an ATM switch.  Thus ATM SPVCs support both native
   ATM, and non-ATM services and are used in both network and service
   interworking deployment scenarios.  Non-ATM services continue to
   drive deployments of ATM SPVCs.  By transparently supporting ATM
   switched services over the PSN, existing provisioning tools and
   operational procedures may be used.  It is therefore important to
   provide methods for interworking ATM switched services and PSN based
   services such as Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS).

   In this document, the attachment circuits on both the ingress and
   egress Provider Ede Nodes (PEs) are either ATM SPVCs/SPVPs or ATM
   SVCs/SVPs.  In addition, ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI)
   routing may run between the ingress and egress PEs.

   There are no methods to signal port connections in ATM, and thus
   there is no intent to provide VPWS services for transporting an
   entire ATM port across the PSN using these services.  These services
   should use standard VPWS services instead.  This may include the
   tunnelling of many VC's including PNNI Routing Control Channels
   (RCCs) and signalling channels within the same port pseudo wire.
   There are no control plane interactions between ATM signalling/
   routing and the underlying PSN, and therefore there are no protocol
   considerations.

   This document describes methods and procedures specified in ATM Forum
   Specification "ATM-MPLS Network Interworking Signalling
   Specification, Version 1.0"[8].

1.4  Relevance

   This informative document shows how the existing Layer 2 Virtual
   Private Network framework (L2VPN)[6] and the Pseudo Wire Emulation
   Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architecture [4] can be leveraged to tunnel ATM
   signalling and routing through the PSN.  We show how ATM pseudo wires
   can be established and released as required by the ATM switched
   service, without requiring changes to existing IETF protocols e.g.
   [2], [3], [7].  This addresses work item 2 of the Layer 2 VPN working
   group charter for signalling layer 2 information.

                         Figure 3: Architecture

   Figure 3 shows the general architecture for ATM VPWS.  The attachment
   circuits are ATM VCCs or VPCs that span an ATM network.  ATM
   connections are mapped to Pseudo Wires (PWs) in the PSN tunnel.	ATM
   SVC services start and terminate on the attached CE devices, while
   the signalling for the SPVC services originates and terminates on the
   ATM switches in the ATM networks that the CEs are physically attached
   to, or on the PE where there is only a single hop path netween the CE
   and the PE.  The objective is to provide service over a PSN without
   impacting the ATM signalling that occurs between the CE devices, and
   without requiring changes to non-ATM protocols between PE1 and PE2
   e.g.  MPLS [2], the PWE3 control protocol [7], or RSVP-TE [3].

   ATM signalling and routing typically operates over PNNI [10] or AINI
   [11] interfaces.  Signalling and routing messages for these protocols
   are carried on dedicated ATM VCCs.  These are known as Signalling
   Channels for signalling messages and Routing Control Channels (RCCs)
   for PNNI routing messages.  For ATM link managent messages, an ILMI
   channel [13] may be used.  For AINI, static ATM routing is assumed
   and so no RCC is present.

2.1  Tunnelling of the ATM Control Plane

   The terminology used in this section follows the L2VPN naming
   conventions.  The use of the pseudo wire label in this section can be
   related to the use of the interworking label within [8].

     Figure 4: Extending ATM Signalling and Routing Across the PSN

   Figure 4 shows how ATM signalling and routing is extended across the
   PSN between attached ATM networks.  In the case of ILMI, a PW would
   also be present that represents an ILMI channel in the ATM network.

2.1.1  Extending ATM Signalling Across the PSN

   In the case of signalling, a bidirectional PW is established using
   the PW signalling protocol [7], or by configuration.  These PWs carry
   the ATM signalling channel messages transparently across the PSN for
   either PNNI or AINI.  This allows all of the existing and future ATM
   signalling capabilities to be carried transparently.

   [8] explains how ATM signalling is extended across the PSN to
   advertise PW labels between PE1 and PE2.  The PNNI and AINI protocol
   extensions described in [8] add an Interworking Information Element
   (IE) which supports label exchange between the PE pair for the ATM
   connection pseudo wire and the negotiation of encapsulation methods
   for the connection.  There is no requirement for any ATM capable
   system, other than the PEs, to understand or support the Interworking
   IE.  Therefore legacy systems can take advantage of the interworking
   capabilities without need for software modifications.  Since ATM
   signalling messages are carried transparently between the PE pairs,
   there are no protocol considerations for the PSN related to the
   signalling and establishment of ATM connection pseudo wires.

   The pseudo wire label for an ATM connection is carried between the
   two PEs in the Interworking IE within the PNNI or AINI signalling
   messages.  As the label is significant only to the PE devices at
   either end of the PSN tunnel, this IE can be added to the signalling
   message by the PE.  Where other non-ATM VPWS services are also
   supported by the PE and pseudo wire labels are allocated from the
   same label space as ATM pseudo wires, the PE will need to manage
   common resources between multiple control plane protocols e.g.  [8]



Bocci, et al.           Expires January 13, 2005                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          PNNI-L2VPN Interworking                July 2004


   and [7].  This is a common capability in current PE devices.

2.1.2  Extending PNNI Routing Across the PSN

   ATM Routing is also extended between PE1 and PE2 as explained in [8].
   Before the ATM routing can start exchanging ATM reachability across
   the PSN tunnel, a PNNI RCC must be set up between PE1 and PE2 in
   Figure 4.  As in the case of signalling, the PW control protocol [7],
   or configuration, sets up a bidirectional PW to carry the ATM routing
   messages in each direction.  This PW represents an RCC between PE1
   and PE2.

   For PNNI, the PSN tunnel can be modelled as a PNNI link between PE1
   and PE2, thus extending ATM reachability across the MPLS network
   using any desired meshing.  Therefore, PNNI Routing can take
   advantage of any parallel or alternate tunnels through the MPLS
   network.  This includes the use of multiple	hops (i.e.  a sparse
   mesh), whereby the pseudo wire leaves one PSN tunnel at a given PE,
   is processed by the ATM signalling on that PE, and enters another PSN
   tunnel before terminating at the egress PE.

   PNNI Routing can also properly traffic engineer the usage of any
   traffic engineered MPLS PSN tunnels.  This is achieved by PNNI
   Routing advertising the available bandwidth of an MPLS PSN tunnel for
   use by the pseudo wires to the attached ATM networks.  Any of the ATM
   addressing formats can be used in these network situations and is
   fully transparent to the PSN.

   This method supports all currently deployed PNNI network scenarios,
   including PNNI Hierarchy.

   Note that signalling of the PSN tunnel is beyond the scope of this
   document.

2.1.3  ATM Control Plane Association to PSN Tunnels

   There is no stipulation or restriction on how PSN Tunnels are
   established between two PE devices.  The architecture requires at
   least one bidirectional PSN Tunnel between two PE devices, but can
   also support multiple PSN Tunnels modeled as a single PNNI or AINI
   link.  In its simplest default case, a single PSN Tunnel is
   represented as a single PNNI or AINI link.  The control pseudo wires
   i.e those representing Signalling Channels and RCCs, are carried
   "in-band" - that is within the PSN tunnel whose ATM PWs they control.

   In other cases, where multiple PSN Tunnels may be used to support QoS
   guarantees, resiliency requirements or more efficient usage of PSN
   resources, a single set of control pseudo wires may be used to manage

Internet-Draft          PNNI-L2VPN Interworking                July 2004


   the resources of all PSN tunnels available for ATM established
   between the two PEs.  These control pseudo wires may be carried
   within one of the PSN Tunnel pairs, but are not required to be
   associated directly with the tunnels they control.

2.1.4  Encapsulation Format

   Any of the ATM PW encapsulations can be used for both PWs carrying
   user data, and those used for RCC, ILMI or Signalling channels.  The
   PW types as defined in [5] are used for user connections based on the
   signalled ATM parameters, as defined in [8].  The choice of
   encapsulation will depend on its ability to support the requirements
   of the ATM service, as described in	[5].

   Negotiation of an encapsulation mode is a local matter between a pair
   of PEs.  While an ATM end system may add the Interworking IE to
   request a specific encapsulation mode at any interworking interface,
   it is not required.  The PE should support a default mode for
   connections signalled without a specific encapsulation indicated.
   Alternatively, the PE may select from among its supported
   encapsulations based on local policies.  It is expected that the
   default will be to use a cell mode pseudo wire.

2.1.5  Quality of Service

   Many of the ATM QoS guarantees can continue to be met through the PSN
   core.  This is possible with the use of traffic-engineered MPLS
   DiffServ PSN tunnels [14].  This is discussed in more detail in [9]
   section 9 and Appendix V.  PNNI can use these mappings to advertise
   the resources available for ATM connections on the PSN tunnel to the
   attached ATM networks.  The attached ATM networks will see these
   resources as native ATM resources.  Generalized Connection Admission
   Control (GCAC) of PNNI running in the attached ATM networks can then
   use these advertised resources as a part of the route selection
   decision.

   Note that the translation of ATM traffic parameters into bandwidth
   parameters for utilization in the PSN needs to take into account the
   overhead associated with the PW type.

2.2  Resiliency

   The tunnelling of PNNI through the PSN means that either PSN-based
   protection mechanisms may be used to provide resiliency, or
   optionally PNNI-based mechanisms, or both.  Failure detection timers
   of each mechanism may need to be adjusted in order to allow one
   mechanism priority over the other.

2.2.1  PSN-based Protection of the PSN Tunnel

   The PSN tunnel can be protected from failures in the PSN using PSN
   specific mechanisms, for example MPLS Fast Reroute [12].  Whichever
   mechanism is chosen, the PSN tunnel needs to continue to support	any
   QoS guarantees given to the ATM connections following any restorative
   action.

2.2.2  PNNI-based Protection of the Pseudo Wires

   PNNI has its own mechanisms to provide resiliency in a native ATM
   network.  These same mechanisms can be used without modification to
   provide protection for the ATM pseudo wires carried through the PSN.
   Two examples are given below.

                     Figure 5: Dual Homing Example

   Figure 5 shows an example of multi-homing of the ATM network into the
   PSN cloud, using PNNI rerouting to protect against failures of PE1 or
   the PSN tunnel.  An additional PE, PE3.  is shown in the network
   above that is connected to the ATM network, together with an
   additional PSN tunnel from PE3 to PE2.  Both PSN tunnels are
   configured as PNNI links, with associated RCCs and Signalling
   Channels.  If PSN tunnel PE1->PE2 fails, then PNNI can automatically
   reroute all ATM connections on PSN tunnel PE1->PE2 to PSN tunnel
   PE3->PE2.

                    Figure 6: Multi-Hop ATM Routing

   Figure 6 shows a third PE, PE3, attached to an additional ATM
   network.  PE3 is connected to PE1 and PE2 using PSN tunnels.  All
   three tunnels (PE1->PE2, PE1->PE3, PE3->PE2) can be configured as
   PNNI links so that PNNI can automatically use the alternate path
   formed by PSN tunnels PE1->PE3 and then PE3->PE2 if tunnel PE1->PE2
   fails.  PE3 simply acts as a transit ATM/PNNI node in this scenario.

2.3  Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   ATM OAM is tunnelled through the PSN, as described in [5].  ATM OAM
   is notified of PSN tunnel failures in the same way as it handles port
   or virtual port failures in an ATM switched network.  The mechanisms
   for detecting tunnel failures depends on the PSN mechanisms used and
   is outside the scope of this document.  Fault management procedures
   for homogeneous attachement circuits, as applicable to this document,
   are detailed in [15].

3.  Summary

   This informational document has introduced the method for extending
   ATM signalling and routing across an MPLS PSN.  This is specified in
   [8].

   Simple extensions to PNNI and AINI signalling are described that
   enable ATM signalling on each PE attached to the PSN to allocate PW
   labels and to negotiate the encapsulation format used by ATM PWs.
   ATM routing can also be extended between the PEs in the case of PNNI.
   These extensions to PNNI and AINI allow end to end ATM switched
   services across a PSN, including transparent support for all
   currently deployed features of PNNI and AINI.  Future enhancements to
   PNNI and AINI can also be supported.

   This is possible without requiring changes to, or direct protocol
   interactions with, IETF protocols specified for the PSN connecting
   the two PEs.  No changes are required to the PSN itself, or to the
   attached ATM networks.  This is particularly important in the case of
   the migration of existing ATM services to an MPLS based PSN, because
   it minimises changes to mechanisms used to provide resiliency to end
   to end ATM services, and other services such as frame relay and
   Ethernet that may rely on the underlying ATM infrastructure.  The
   extensions to PNNI and AINI thus provide a natural migration path to
   enable a PSN to support the complete range of services provided by
   core ATM network infrastructure today.
