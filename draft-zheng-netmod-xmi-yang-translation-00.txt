Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism of translating XMI UML objects into
   YANG modules. With the translation mechanism, the data objects
   defined in XMI UML objects could be accessed via NETCONF.

1. Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism of translating XMI (XML Metadata
   Interchange) [XMI] specified Model into YANG [RFC6020] modules. With
   the translation mechanism, the data objects defined in XMI UML
   objects could be accessed via NETCONF [RFC6241].

   MOF is the foundation technology for describing metamodels. It covers
   a wide range of domains, and is based on a constrained subset of UML.
   XMI is widely used XML interchange format of UML. It defines the
   following aspects involved in describing objects in:

      - The representation of objects in terms of XML elements and
      attributes.
      - The standard mechanisms to link objects within the same file or
      across files.
      - The validation of XMI documents using XML Schemas.
      - Object identity, which allows objects to be referenced from
      other objects in terms of IDs and UUIDs.

   The YANG modules that generated from XMI model should not be modified.
   Any necessary changes should be made by modifying the original XMI
   model (with proper updates of the XMI LAST-UPDATED and REVISION
   clauses) and then running the translation defined in this memo again.
   Note that this does not affect the usage of YANG augments and or YANG
   deviations: YANG modules generated from XMI model can be augmented
   like any other YANG module, and YANG deviations can be used to
   document how an implementation deviates from the generated YANG
   module.

2. Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

   Terminology:

3. Requirements for translating XMI to YANG

   As YANG is gradually becoming mature, more and more working groups
   are planning or have chosen YANG as the information model description
   language. These working groups or their service areas have existed
   for many years. Each working group already has their information
   model, and they used to use their traditional information model
   designing tools and hope to continue using the tools for a long time
   (e.g. using SMIv2 to construct MIB; using UML tools to build the UML
   objects). They only provide the YANG models when publishing the
   models.

   As we all know, there has been a standard [RFC6643] of SMI to YANG
   conversion. But there is no standard to guide how to convert UML
   objects to YANG models. This memo specifying the conversion rules of
   translating XMI formatted UML models to YANG models.

4. Mapping of Well-Known Types

   The SMIv2 base types and some well-known derived textual conventions
   are mapped to YANG types by this section's rules.

5. Translation of XMI Model classes

   This section will describe how classes are translated. (TBD)

6. Translation of XMI Attributes

   This section will describe how XMI Attributes are translated.

   6.1. Element Identification Attributes

   TBD.

   6.2. Linking Attributes

   TBD.

   6.3. Type Attribute

   TBD.

7. Translation of Model Representation

   This section will describe how Model Representation are translated.
