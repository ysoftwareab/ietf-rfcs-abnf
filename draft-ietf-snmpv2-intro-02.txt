          The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of       |
          version 2 of                                                    |
          the Internet-standard Network Management Framework, termed the  |
          SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2).  This framework is derived   |
          from the original Internet-standard Network Management          |
          Framework (SNMPv1):                                             |

               the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for
               the purpose of management.  RFC 1212 [2] defines a more    |
               concise description mechanism,                             |
               which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

          3.  Components of the SNMPv2 Framework

          A network management system contains: several (potentially
          many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent,
          which has access to management instrumentation; at least one
          management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey
          management information between the agents and management
          stations.  Operations of the protocol are carried out under an
          administrative framework which defines both authentication and
          authorization policies.

          Network management stations execute management applications
          which monitor and control network elements.  Network elements
          are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc.,
          which are monitored and controlled through access to their
          management information.


          3.1.  Structure of Management Information

          Management information is viewed as a collection of managed
          objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the
          Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related
          objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written
          using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
          [6].  It is the purpose of the Structure of Management
          Information for SNMPv2 document [7] to define that subset.

          The SMI is divided into four parts: object definitions, trap
          definitions, compliance definitions, and capabilities
          definitions.

          (1)  Object definitions are used when describing managed
               objects.  An ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to
               concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a managed
               object.  Collections of related objects are grouped
               together to form a unit of conformance.  An ASN.1 macro,
               OBJECT-GROUP, is used to concisely convey the syntax and
               semantics of a group.

          (2)  Notification definitions are used when describing an       |
               unsolicited transmission of management information.        |
               An ASN.1 macro, NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to concisely    |
               convey the syntax and semantics of a notification.         |

          Draft               Introduction to SNMPv2              Oct 92


          (3)  Compliance definitions are used when describing
               requirements for management agents with respect to object
               definitions.  An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-COMPLIANCE, is used
               to concisely convey such requirements.

          (4)  Capability definitions are used when describing the
               capabilities of agents with respect to object
               definitions.  An ASN.1 macro, AGENT-CAPABILITIES, is used
               to concisely convey such capabilities.


          3.2.  Textual Conventions

          When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to define
          types, with a different name, but the same syntax, as one of
          the types defined in the SMI.  These are termed textual
          conventions, and are used for the convenience of humans
          reading the MIB module.  It is the purpose of the Textual
          Conventions for SNMPv2 document [8] to define the initial set
          of textual conventions available to all MIB modules.

          Objects defined using a textual convention are always encoded
          by means of the rules that define their primitive type.
          However, textual conventions often have special semantics
          associated with them.  As such, an ASN.1 macro, TEXTUAL-
          CONVENTION, is used to concisely convey the syntax and
          semantics of a textual convention.


          3.3.  Protocol Operations

          The management protocol provides for the exchange of messages
          which convey management information between the agents and the
          management stations.  The form of these messages is a message
          "wrapper" which encapsulates a Protocol Data Unit (PDU).  The
          form and meaning of the "wrapper" is determined by an
          administrative framework which defines both authentication and
          authorization policies.

          It is the purpose of the Protocol Operations for SNMPv2
          document [9] to define the operations of the protocol with
          respect to the sending and receiving of the PDUs.

          3.4.  Transport Mappings

          The management protocol, version 2 of the Simple Network
          Management Protocol, may be used over a variety of protocol
          suites.  It is the purpose of the Transport Mappings for
          SNMPv2 document [10] to define how the SNMPv2 maps onto an
          initial set of transport domains.  Other mappings may be
          defined in the future.

          Although several mappings are defined, the mapping onto UDP is
          the preferred mapping.  As such, to provide for the greatest
          level of interoperability, systems which choose to deploy
          other mappings should also provide for proxy service to the
          UDP mapping.


          3.5.  Protocol Instrumentation

          It is the purpose of the Management Information Base for
          SNMPv2 document [11] to define managed objects which describe
          the behavior of a SNMPv2 entity.  The Manager to Manager MIB
          document [12] defines an initial set of managed objects which
          describe the behavior of a SNMPv2 entity which acts in a
          manager role.  It is expected that extensions to this MIB will
          be defined in the future.


          3.6.  Administrative Framework

          The administrative framework used by the SNMPv2 is based on
          the SNMP Administrative Framework defined in [13], with these
          modifications:

          (1)  For every occurrence of the term "SNMP", substitute the
               term "SNMPv2".

          (2)  For every occurrence of the term "Internet-standard
               Network Management Framework", substitute the term
               "SNMPv2 Framework".

          (3)  The mapping of SNMPv2 over UDP is termed "snmpUDPDomain",
               as defined in [10].  This replaces any use of
               "rfc1351domain".

          (4)  Any ASN.1 objects IMPORTed from RFC 1157 are imported
               from [9] instead.

          (5)  SNMPv2 uses a modified Digest Authentication Protocol,
               smpMD5AuthProtocol [7], which differs from the Digest
               Authentication Protocol in [14] in two ways: there is no
               ordered delivery mechanism, and, the clock
               synchronization algorithm is simplified.

               The initial configuration assigned, by convention, to the
               initialPartyIds uses smpMD5AuthProtocol as the value of
               partyAuthProtocol for parties 3, 4, 5, and 6.

               The Ordered Delivery Mechanism described in Section 7.3.5
               of [14] is not used in the modified Digest Authentication
               Protocol.

               As a result:

                    All references to `nonce' and `last-timestamp' are
                    deleted.

                    Step 3 of Section 4.1 of [14] is omitted.

                    Steps 4 and 5 of Section 4.2 of [14] are omitted.

                    The AuthInformation data type is modified, as
                    described below.

               Appendix A explains the rationale for the removal of
               ordered delivery.

               In order to simplify clock synchronization, the Selective
               Clock Acceleration Mechanism described in Section 7.3.7
               of [14] is extended to apply to the authentication clocks
               of both the source and destination parties of a message.
               To facilitate this, the sender's notion of both the
               source party's clock and the destination party's clock
               are included as authentication information in a message
               when using the modified Digest Authentication Protocol.

               As a result:

                    For every occurrence of the term "authTimeStamp",
                    substitute the term "authSrcTimeStamp".

                    The AuthInformation data type is modified to be:

                             AuthInformation ::=
                                 CHOICE {
                                     [2]
                                         IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
                                             authDigest
                                                OCTET STRING,
                                             authDstTimestamp
                                                INTEGER (0..2147483647),
                                             authSrcTimestamp
                                                INTEGER (0..2147483647)
                                         },

                                         OCTET STRING
                                 }

                    Step 2 of Section 4.1 of [14] is modified to set
                    authSrcTimestamp to the authentication clock value
                    of the message's source party, and to retrieve the
                    value of the authentication clock for the
                    destination party from the local database and set
                    authDstTimestamp to this retrieved value.

                    Step 11 of Section 4.2 of [14] is modified to update
                    the local database's values of whichever one or both
                    of the authentication clocks for the source and
                    destination parties is less than the values of
                    authSrcTimestamp and authDstTimestamp, respectively.

                    The Clock Synchronization algorithm described in
                    Section 6.3 of [14] is modified to omit both the
                    retrieval of the agent's notion of the
                    authentication clock of the party executing at the
                    agent, and the checking for and rectification of
                    case 1 (i.e., the issuing of a set operation to
                    advance the agent's notion of that clock.)

               Appendix B explains the rationale for this approach to
               clock synchronization.

          (6)  In order to calculate the digest, Step 7 in Section 4.2
               of [14] indicates that the receiving party must
               reconstruct the SnmpAuthMsg generated by the sending
               party. This reconstruction must exactly reproduce the BER

               encoding generated by the sending party.  In particular,
               although BER encodings are unambiguous, they are not
               unique, because a length field may use more than the
               minimum number of octets necessary. (Note that
               regenerating the BER encoding is trivial; once the
               privData field of the SnmpPrivMsg has been deciphered,
               the privData field contains the original BER encoding
               used by the sending party.)

          (7)  The use of a privacy protocol (e.g., the Symmetric
               Privacy Protocol which is specified to use DES) is
               required only for the distribution of party secrets when
               creating new parties via the SNMPv2.  That is, the use of
               DES is not required for the maintenance of existing
               party, in particular for the changing of party secrets;
               but, in order to create a new party using SNMPv2, a
               privacy protocol, which offers protection from non-
               disclosure, must be used by both the source and
               destination parties.

          (8)  Instead of returning a `readOnly' error on an
               authorization failure, an `authorizationError' [9] is
               returned instead.

          (9)  Access control with instance-level granularity is
               considered beyond the scope of a SNMPv2 entity acting in
               an agent role.  As such, no implementation of a SNMPv2
               entity acting in an agent role is required to support
               values of viewSubtree [15] which have more sub-
               identifiers than is necessary to identify a particular
               leaf object type.  However, access control is used in
               determining which SNMPv2 entities acting in a manager
               role should receive trap notifications (Section 8.5 of
               [9]).  As such, agent implementors might wish to provide
               instance-level granularity in order to allow a management
               station to use fine-grain configuration of trap
               notifications.

          (10) A restriction on any valid entry in the aclTable [15] is
               that the parties identified by the aclTarget and
               aclSubject columns use identical authentication protocols
               (partyAuthProtocol [15]).

          4.  Acknowledgements

          The SNMPv2 framework is based on the outstanding technical
          direction pioneered by the original authors of the SGMP: James
          R. (Chuck) Davin, of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science,
          Mark S. Fedor, of Performance Systems International, Inc.,
          Martin L. Schoffstall, also of PSI, and Jeffrey D. Case.

          Since the invention of the SGMP in 1987, many individuals have
          devoted much energy toward creating the unprecedented success
          of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework.  As
          such, the list of people worthy of acknowledgement is too
          great to enumerate here.

          However, in retrospect, it seems clear that the concepts in
          the original architecture, as envisioned by Chuck Davin, have
          provided the basis for the success of the current framework.
          We hope that the SNMPv2 framework will be able to successfully
          build on this work.

          Finally, the comments of the SNMP Version 2 working group are
          gratefully acknowledged:

          Appendix A: Rationale for Removal of Ordered Delivery
          Mechanism

          The Ordered Delivery Mechanism described in Section 7.3.5 of
          [14] is used by the Digest Authentication Protocol.  This
          mechanism causes messages which are delivered out of order to
          be declared unauthentic.  This is unnecessary, detrimental to
          the efficiency of network management, and overlaps with other
          mechanisms used by the Digest Authentication Protocol.  In
          particular:

          (1)  There is no security requirement to protect against
               malicious re-ordering of network management retrieval
               operations, especially since such re-ordering can and
               does happen through normal, non-malicious, operation of a
               network.  Thus, the use of the Ordered Delivery mechanism
               can cause genuine authentic messages to be declared
               unauthentic due to the normal operation of a network.
               Even worse, this behavior is likely to happen more
               frequently under conditions of network stress, at which
               times network management needs to perform at its best.
               Thus, use of the Ordered Delivery mechanism is
               detrimental to efficiency of network management.

          (2)  There is a security requirement to protect against
               malicious re-ordering of network management set
               operations.  However, this requirement is not just
               protection for those issued by one network manager, but
               is in fact across set operations issued on behalf of all
               network managers (i.e., across set operations directed to
               all SNMPv2 parties.) The Ordered Delivery mechanism
               operates only within parties, not across parties, and
               therefore, is not sufficient to provide the required
               protection.  To address this issue, SNMPv2 defines a new
               MIB object, snmpSetSerialNo [11], which provides the
               required protection.  Thus, not only is Ordered Delivery
               not sufficient, it is now also unnecessary.

          (3)  The Digest Authentication Protocol in [14] specifies the
               use of the Message Timeliness Mechanism described in
               Section 7.3.6 of [14] as well as the Ordered Delivery
               mechanism.  There was overlap in the functionality of
               these two mechanisms.  With use of the Ordered Delivery
               mechanism removed, this overlap is removed.  The Message
               Timeliness Mechanism is retained to provide protection

               outside of the designated period (i.e., the lifetime)
               during which replay and/or out-of-order delivery can
               occur non-maliciously due to the normal operation of the
               network.

          Appendix B: Rationale for Extending the Selective Clock
          Acceleration Mechanism

          The Selective Clock Acceleration Mechanism described in
          Section 7.3.7 of [14] is used by the Digest Authentication
          Protocol.  This mechanism causes the receiver's notion of the
          authentication clock of a message's source party to be
          advanced, if necessary, to match that party's timestamp value
          in a received message.  By extending this mechanism to apply
          also to a message's destination party, the regular operation
          of this mechanism corrects not only cases 2 and 3 as described
          in Section 6.3 of [14], but also case 1.  The clock
          synchronization algorithm described in Section 6.3 of [14] is
          thereby simplified.

          Note that while this extension requires the AuthInformation
          data type to be modified, a modification to this data type is
          already required by the removal of the Ordered Delivery
          mechanism as described earlier in Appendix A.
