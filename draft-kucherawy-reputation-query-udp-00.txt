Internet-Draft         Reputation Queries with UDP             June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a method to query a reputation data service for
   information about an entity, using the User Datagram Protocol.  It is
   part of a series defining the overall reputation query/response
   structure as well as the concept of reputation "vocabularies" for
   particular applications.


2.  Document Series

   This memo represents the media type registration, part of a series of
   documents that define the overall service and introduce the initial
   exemplary applications.  The series is as follows:

   1.  RFCxxxx: A Model for Reputation Interchange

   2.  RFCxxxx+1: A Media Type for Reputation Information

   3.  RFCxxxx+2: Using UDP for Reputation Interchange (this memo)

   4.  RFCxxxx+3: Using the DNS for Reputation Interchange

   5.  RFCxxxx+4: Using HTTP/XML for Reputation Interchange

   6.  RFCxxxx+5: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Identity Reputation

   7.  RFCxxxx+6: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Property Reputation


3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.2.  Other Definitions
