1.  Introduction

   For vehicular networks, it is required to provide connection to the
   Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) for the driver's safety,
   efficient driving and entertainment with fast mobility management.
   Other scenarios besides V2I communication, like V2V and V2X
   communication are also considered.  Link layer protocols such as IEEE
   802.11-OCB [IEEE-802.11-OCB] are already defined for low-latency and
   alternative networks, and it is designed for enabling IPv6 as a
   network layer protocol.  Nevertheless, for using IPv6 in the
   vehicular network, there are some requirements for optimization as
   described in [ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking].  These issues are
   classified into IPv6 neighbor discovery, mobility management,
   security and privacy.

   In IETF, there are two major ID/Location separation protocols such as
   LISP [RFC6830] and ILNP [RFC6740] for scalable routing, enhancing
   privacy and mobility management.  Currently ID/Location separation
   concept is useful not only for decomposing ID/Location from an IP
   address, but also for control/data plane separation which is a major
   evolution of the Internet infrastructure.  For the vehicular
   networks, ID/Location separation protocols can be expected to meet
   requirements and solve problem statements discussed in IPWAVE WG.
   This document describes use cases for applying ID/Location separation
   architecture to IPv6-based vehicular networks, and analyzes how such
   protocols can meet requirements for IPv6 in vehicular networks.

Internet-Draft   ID/LOC Separation in Vehicular Networks      March 2020


   Figure 1 describes a vehicular network architecture with the LISP
   protocol.  A single LISP site can have multiple RSUs with the
   function of LISP Tunnel Router (xTR) to communicate with other LISP
   sites.  In the figure, we assume that Vehicles 1, 2 and 3 belong to
   LISP site 1 and Vehicle 4 to LISP site 2.  IPv6 addresses for
   wireless interfaces of each vehicle are mapped to unique End-Point
   IDs (EIDs), which can communicate with other EIDs in the same LISP
   site same as a legacy IPv6 operation.  That is, vehicles are able to
   communicate with an RSU by V2I communication at the same time with
   other vehicles in the same LISP site by V2V communication.

   Traffic control center in the vehicular cloud is appropriate to
   deploy a mapping system, since it is a point accessible from all
   RSUs.  When vehicles enter each LISP site and attach to an RSU, the
   RSU sends a Map-Register message to the mapping system including
   vehicle's EID and RLOC of the attached RSU.  After registration, the
   vehicle can be provided with reachability from other LISP sites or
   non-LISP sites.  In the figure, for the communication between vehicle
   4 and vehicle 3, RSU 3 which is the attachment point of Vehicle 4
   should request for the RLOC of vehicle 3 from the mapping system by
   sending Map-Requests message.  After receiving mapping information of
   Vehicle 3's EID and its RLOC in Map-Reply message, RLOC 3 can forward
   packets via the IP tunnel between xTR (e.g., RSU 2 in this figure)
   assigned to vehicle 3.  Note that several data plane protocols (e.g.,
   SRv6, etc.) can be used with LISP control plane functions.

3.2.  Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

   In the ILNPv6, an IPv6 address is replaced with an Identifier-Locator
   Vector (I-LV).  The I-LV has a 128-bit length allowing it to be
   applied to the current IPv6 header without modification.  [RFC6740]
   describes in detail how an I-LV value can replace an IPv6 address at
   the same time how it can work in the current IPv6-based
   infrastructure.  In [RFC6741], the details of the ILNPv6 packet
   header, locator subnetting and new DNS resource record type for
   mapping I-LV values are defined.

   A vehicular network architecture for supporting ILNP is shown in
   Figure 2.  Most of the components are similar with the architecture
   described in [ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking].  Every Vehicle can
   have more than one NID to connect to a network, and the IPv6 address
   for communication is represented as a combination of Node Identifier
   (NID) and Locator.  Site Border Router (SBR) can be implemented in an
   RSU or border of ILNP subnet site, which should have a routing table
   having the mapping information of I-LV values for forwarding packets.
   A DNS server can be deployed in the vehicular cloud which is
   accessible from both in ILNP site and external Internet.

4.  Gap Analysis

4.1.  Neighbor Discovery

   In both cases of LISP and ILNP, the usage of the existing neighbor
   discovery message defined in [RFC4861] is possible without
   modification.  In LISP, Vehicles and RSUs in the same LISP site can
   exchange ND/NA messages for routing by EID configured as IPv6 format.
   Also, ILNP can operate the neighbor discovery for the configuration
   of an I-LV value as the I-LV for ILNPv6 occupies the same bits as the
   IPv6 address in the IPv6 header[RFC6740].  Thus, for vehicular

   networking, it is expected that the same solutions already mentioned
   in [ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking] (e.g., new ND option
   [ID-Vehicular-ND]) can also be applicable in the ID/Location
   separation architecture.

4.2.  Mobility Management

   One of the advantages for using LISP is that mobility management can
   be provided efficiently, when a device is roaming across different
   LISP sites while maintaining its EID.  The existing IP mobilty
   management schemes such as MIP or PMIP require an anchor function
   (e.g., Home Agent and Local Mobility Anchor) to maintain the IP
   address of a mobile node when the mobile node moves.  They can
   construct a non-optimized forwarding path between the anchor and
   current attachment point of the mobile node.  In LISP, however, a
   forwarding path can be optimized by updating EID-RLOC mapping
   information and establishing an IP tunnel between the xTR of the
   coresponding node and the xTR of the current mobile node's
   attachement point.  This provides advantages for easly optimizing a
   forwarding path especially the vehicular networks where the
   connection point of the mobile node can be move fast away from its
   initial attachment point.  In the vehicular networks, a vehicle with
   an EID will roam much faster and it means that the mapped RLOC will
   be changed more frequently.  For faster RLOC assignment, a predictive
   RLOC algorithm for roaming-EID is proposed in LISP WG
   [draft-ietf-lisp-predictive-rlocs].  Using this algorithm, it
   predicts the moving direction of a vehicle with a roaming-EID,
   registers predictive RLOCs as a list to the mapping system, and
   replicates packets to each RLOC in the list.  It can minimize packet
   loss while maintaining transport session continuity.

   In ILNP, mobility management is classified into host mobility and
   network (or site) mobility.  For vehicular networks, host mobility
   scenario is suitable [RFC6740].  When the vehicle moves to its
   network attachment point and locator, it shortly becomes to belong to
   a new site, it may send a Locator Update (LU) message to the
   Corresponding Node (CN) and also send a request to the DNS server to
   change its entry.  Even though LU procedure is necessary, it causes
   delay and packet loss during handover, and it may become a more
   critical issue in the vehicular networks where the locator of a
   vehicle is updated faster and more frequently.  Therefore, ILNP needs
   to minimize LU process including DNS updates for seamless mobility
   management in vehicular networks.  For example,
   [ILNP-Sol-Wireless-Net] may be one possible solution that defines a
   geological information server, which gives information of attachment
   points nearby to devices to prepare handover, deliver its predictive
   locator to the CN so that it can reduce packet loss and latency for
   updating DNS.

4.3.  Security and Privacy

   For supporting applications such as autonomous driving, the vehicular
   networks require not only low latency and high bandwidth but also a
   high level of security and privacy.  The IPWAVE working group is
   facing a mobility management challenge due to latency and management
   complexity due to the exchange of signaling messages with mobility
   anchor to establish a tunnel.  In the ID/Location separation
   approach, all vehicles maintain their unique ID while they are
   allocated a locator in the fastest way without binding update
   procedure.  Nevertheless, a privacy problem still exists due to the
   eacy access to the mapping system.  Even though it is difficult to
   track a device using a single RLOC or locator value since its locator
   changes while moving across sites, on the other hand, since an EID or
   identifier is defined as permanent, additional methodologies need to
   be considered to secure device identifier information.

   Another consideration is various communication links.  In the
   vehicular networks, not only V2I communication but also V2X
   communication are required.  It means that vehicles can directly
   communicate with each other only with an ID value without a locator
   which is allocated from the infrastructure.  In this scenario, the
   exposure of vehicle IDs to others (including hackers) occurs
   frequently even though they do not access mapping system.  In
   [draft-iannone-pidloc-privacy], they describe about privacy issues
   and requirements in ID/Location separation architecture.

   Several existing works can provide enhanced privacy mechanisms in ID/
   Location separation architectures.  For example,
   [draft-ietf-lisp-eid-anonymity] defines Ephemeral-EID which is
   frequently changed by the device.  For ILNP, identity privacy
   supports using IPv6 privacy extensions for stateless address
   autoconfiguration [RFC4941] and Locator Rewriting Relay (LRR)
   component for locator privacy [RFC6748], can be solutions for
   enhancing privacy in vehicular networks.
