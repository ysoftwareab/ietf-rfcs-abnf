1.  Introduction

   In order to support new protocols and practices, the IETF
   occasionally reserves an address block for a special purpose.  For
   example, [RFC1122] reserves an IPv4 address block (0.0.0.0/8) to
   represent the local (i.e., "this") network.  Likewise, [RFC4291]
   reserves an IPv6 address block (fe80::/10) to represent link-scoped
   unicast addresses.

   The current list of all special-purpose address blocks are described
   in [RFC6890].  However, several issues have been raised with how
   "global" is defined in that document.  Specifically, the definition
   of global provided in [RFC6890] focuses on the prefix's ability to be
   routed globally within the Internet and does not indicate if the
   prefix is globally scoped (i.e., may be routed beyond the local link;
   described as "global unicast" in the IPv6 addressing architecture
   [RFC4291]).

   This memo reiterates the assignments made to the IPv4 and IPv6
   Special-Purpose Address Registries and augments the fields contained
   within the registires in order to address the confusion raised by the
   definition of "global".  Furthermore, this memo defines:

   o  a common set of information that the registries will maintain
      regarding each special-purpose address block

   o  a common set of requirements for future entries

   This memo obsoletes [RFC6890].

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Assignment of an IPv4 Address Block to IANA

   Table 7 of this document records the assignment of an IPv4 address
   block (192.0.0.0/24) to IANA for IETF protocol assignments.  This
   address allocation to IANA is intended to support IETF protocol
   assignments.  A more general view of the roles of IANA with respect
   to address allocation functions is documented in Sections 4.1 and 4.3
   [RFC2860].

   IANA has designated special-purpose address blocks in compliance with
   [RFC2860].

2.2.  Restructuring of the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address
      Registries

   IANA has restructured the following registries:

      IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry

      IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry

   The IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry records all IPv4 special-
   purpose address blocks.  These reservations include, but are not
   limited to, allocations from the 192.0.0.0/24 address block.
   Likewise, the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry records all IPv6
   special-purpose address blocks.  These reservations include, but are
   not limited to, allocations from the 2001:0000::/23 address block,
   which is a globally scoped address block.

   Section 2.2.1 of this document describes information that both
   registries will maintain for each entry.  IANA has populated the IPv4
   Special-Purpose Address Registry with information taken from
   Section 2.2.2 of this document.  Likewise, IANA has populated the
   IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry with information taken from
   Section 2.2.3 of this document.

   IANA will update the aforementioned registries as requested in the
   "IANA Considerations" section of a document that has passed IETF
   Review [RFC5226].  The "IANA Considerations" section MUST include all
   of the information specified in Section 2.2.1 of this document.

2.2.1.  Information Requirements

   The IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries maintain the
   following information regarding each entry:

      Address Block - A block of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that has been
      registered for a special purpose.

      Name - A descriptive name for the special-purpose address block.

      RFC - The RFC through which the special-purpose address block was
      requested.

      Allocation Date - The date upon which the special-purpose address
      block was allocated.

      Termination Date - The date upon which the allocation is to be
      terminated.  This field is applicable for limited-use allocations
      only.

      Source - A boolean value indicating whether an address from the
      allocated special-purpose address block is valid when used as the
      source address of an IP datagram that transits two devices.

      Destination - A boolean value indicating whether an address from
      the allocated special-purpose address block is valid when used as
      the destination address of an IP datagram that transits two
      devices.

      Forwardable - A boolean value indicating whether a router may
      forward an IP datagram whose destination address is drawn from the
      allocated special-purpose address block between external
      interfaces.

      Globally Reachable - A boolean value indicating whether an IP
      datagram whose destination address is drawn from the allocated
      special-purpose address block is forwardable beyond a specified
      administrative domain.

      Reserved-by-Protocol - A boolean value indicating whether the
      special-purpose address block is reserved by IP, itself.  This
      value is "TRUE" if the RFC that created the special-purpose
      address block requires all compliant IP implementations to behave
      in a special way when processing packets either to or from
      addresses contained by the address block.

   If the value of "Destination" is FALSE, the values of "Forwardable"
   and "Globally Reachable" must also be false.

3.  Security Considerations

   Security of the Internet's routing system relies on the ability to
   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address block.
   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that the
   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block and
   that there is a trustable and unique reference in the IANA address
   registries.

   The proposed registry is intended to provide an authoritative source
   of information regarding the currency and intended purpose of special
   purpose address blocks that are designated from the IANA-administered
   Special-Purpose registry.  This is a small step towards the creation
   of a comprehensive registry framework that can be used as a trust
   point for commencing a chain of address validation.  Consideration
   should be given to IANA registry publication formats that are machine
   parsable.  Additionally, consideration should be given to the use of
   file signatures and associated certificate mechanisms to allow
   applications to confirm that the registry contents are current and
   that they have been published by the IANA.
