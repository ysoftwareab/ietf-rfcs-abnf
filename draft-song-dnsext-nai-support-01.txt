1. Introduction

   The use of the wireless mobile networking has been dramatically 
   increased thanks to rapid development of wireless technology and 
   commercial deployment of Mobile IP technology [RFC3220].  
   The most recent release of Mobile IPv4 supports the dynamic Home 
   Address assignment mechanism that allow MN (Mobile Node) being
   identified by NAI (Network Access Identifier) [RFC2486] rather than
   static Home IP address.  NAI has a prominent role on the mobile 
   network environment.  This is not only because NAI significantly 
   reduces the IPv4 address shortage problem and but also it provides
   the standardized method for identifying users in order to accomplish
   the interoperability for roaming over multiple ISPs (Internet Service
   Providers).  
   
   The most of the Mobile IPv4 deployment including 3GPP2 CDMA2000 
   wireless packet data system architecture [P.S0001-B] identify 
   the Mobile Node by NAI.  Therefore the need for standardized method
   of binding the ever changing home address of the MN over various ISPs
   to NAI is necessary.  
   
   The DNS basically provides a mechanism to map between hostnames and
   IP address with support of many other RRs thorough hierarchically 
   built domain names. The NAI is of the form user@realm [RFC2486]. 
   Adding NAI as a DNS RR shall enable tracking of the dynamically 
   changed home IP address.  This document specifies a new RR type for
   NAI, mapping host IP address and user identifier (NAI) [RFC2486].


2. Applicability Statement

   Mobile IPv4 is designed to provide the IP mobility that provides
   reasonably seamless IP connectivity.  Since the MN (Mobile Node) is
   no longer necessarily identified by the unique home IP address, 
   the mechanism for the locating and updating newly assigned home IP
   address is required [UM].

   The NAI RR defines user identifier, NAI widely used for PPP dialup 
   connection and Mobile IPv4.  The basic idea is to let mobile Internet 
   user to constantly update its IP address, while moving around 
   multiple access provider network.  It can enables correspondent user
   to always reach the specific user by querying NAI to name server, 
   regardless of the connecting location.
   
   It is expected that NAI RR will be used in IRS(Internet Reachability
   Service) of 3GPP2 wireless IP network standard [P.S0001-B] 
   (see Appendix A).

   The applications that running on the Dynamic Home Address Allocation
   enabled Mobile IPv4 MN (Mobile node) depends on the one to one 
   mapping of NAI and newly assigned mobile host IP address in DNS name
   server for the connectivity with Correspondent nodes. 
   Because it will be the only way the CN (Correspondent Node) can find 
   the Mobile Node's newly assigned IP address.  An example of 
   application is including WWW server, IP push service, Instant 
   Messaging, Multi-user Network games, Multi-chat, etc.
 


3. NAI RR Type
   
   NAI name space is resemble to Domain Name Space, except that it is a 
   sequence of one or more labels, made of the user identifier and
   domain name.  The "@" sign before realm, shall be treated as a 
   delimiter to flag user ID part.  Every user Identifier 
   shall end with "@" sign and placed before domain name.  NAI records 
   cause no additional section processing

   The NAI record has the DNS RR type of "?", hence has the same QTYPE 
   number of "?".  Note NAI RR requires IANA number assignment.
   
   The class of NAI RR is defined in the IN class only.

   TTL should be configured to minimize the time of the RR being cached

   The RDATA of NAI is same as A RDATA format, 32 bit Internet Address

4. Examples

   Resource Record for NAI(junhyuk@xbs.samsung.co.kr) is like below:
  
   junhyuk@.xbs.samsung.co.kr.  1440  IN   NAI  165.213.221.4


5. IANA Considerations

   It requires new RR type number from IANA.

Appendix A. IRS of 3GPP2 wireless IP Network standard 


   In this example, I've omitted the detail operation of deleting 
   DNS record in case of user disconnect.  In IRS, it is assumed that 
   MS desires to be reached by a fixed identifier such as an NAI-like
   hostname


1. Simple IP operation
   
   Upon connecting to new access network MS(Mobile Station) shall 
   generate CHAP authentication with NAI for user authentication.  
   After successfully authenticate the user authentication request, 
   AAAH shall send DNS A record update message to name server.
   (See figure 1)

2. Mobile IP operation

   When the HA receives and successfully replies to an initial Mobile IP 
   Registration Request, it performs the DNS update for the MS if it has 
   previously received an indication from the home RADIUS server to do 
   so, or has otherwise been provisioned to do so.  The HA shall send a 
   DNS Update message [RFC 2136] to the DNS server to add a Resource 
   Record for the MS, if so required by the home RADIUS server [4].
   (See figure 2)
