2. PREAMBLE:

This document lists most of the existent special use prefixes from the IPv4 
space that have been registered with the IANA and now RIRs and provides some 
suggestions for operational procedures when these prefixes are encountered.  
This document does not address IPv4 space that is not registered with the 
IANA/RIRs for special use or address space that is reserved for future 
delegation in the operational Internet. Notice is given to prefixes that 
manufacturers have co-opted.

The current list of special use prefixes:

	0.0.0.0/8	
	127.0.0.0/8
	192.0.2.0/24
	10.0.0.0/8
	172.16.0.0/12
	192.168.0.0/16
	169.254.0.0/16
	192.175.48.0/24: RFC-1918 nameservers.
	192.42.172.0/24: NeXT-Default:
	192.18.0.0/15      RFC 2455 (NOT IANA, but Harvard, for BMWG)
	192.88.99.0/24     RFC 3068
	all D/E space

2.1 Prefix Discussion:

0.0.0.0/8 has a number of unique properties, many of which were built into
the protocol stacks used throughout the Internet. 0.0.0.0/32 or the all-zeros
address has been used and is still recognized as the historical broadcast
address. This use or restriction is deprecated and modern code will treat
broadcast correctly as an all-ones value within the subnet. It is fairly 
common practice to use 0.0.0.0 to encode the idea of "default".

Also, many stacks will allow the system administrator to encode IP addresses
of the form 0.0.160.57, with the presumption that historical, "natural" masks
apply and so this would represent a host that carries the local value of
x.x.160.57 within the /16 net-block that is in use on that media. These 
properties suggest that a prudent network manager & system admin will treat 
0.0.0.0/8 as a special use net-block. Router and Host requirements documents 
and implementations treat this range with special use constraints.

127.0.0.0/8 is earmarked for what is called "loop-back". This construct is 
to allow a node to test/validate its IP stack.  Most software only uses
a single value from this range, 127.0.0.1/32 for loop-back purposes.  It
is treated with the same levels of restriction by router and host requirements
and implementations so it is difficult to use any other addresses within 
this block for anything other than node specific applications, generally 
bootstrapping.  All in all a tremendous waste of IP space. Good thing we'll 
not likely need it.

192.0.2.0/24 is listed as the NET TEST. This prefix is earmarked for use in 
documentation and example code. Network operations and End System 
administrators should ensure that this prefix is not coded into systems
or routed through any infrastructure.  Since it has the appearance of a
"normal" prefix, special precautions should be taken to ensure that this
prefix is not propagated in either the Internet or any private networks
that use the IP protocols.  Often used in conjunction with example.com
or example.net in vendor and protocol documentation.

10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 are the prefixes called out
in RFC 1918. They are only for use in private networks that wish to use
the IP protocols. Network operations and End System administrators should 
ensure that applications do not use these ranges as source or destination
addresses for any packets that traverse the Internet infrastructure.  Since 
they have the appearance of "normal" prefixes, special precautions should be 
taken to ensure that they are not propagated in the Internet. 

169.254.0.0/16 has been ear-marked as the IP range to use for end node 
auto-configuration when a DHCP server may not be found. As such, network
operations and administrators should be VERY aggressive in ensuring that
neither route advertisements nor packet forwarding should occur across
any media boundaries. This is true for the Internet as well as any
private networks that use the IP protocols. End node administrators
should be aware that some vendors will auto-configure and add this
prefix to the nodes forwarding table. This will cause problems with
sites that run router discovery or deprecated routing protocols such as
RIP.

192.175.48.0/24: RFC 1918 nameservers:

The prefix used for nameservers in the public, operational Internet that
are authoritative for RFC 1918 address space. Without these servers, the load
on the root nameservers would be substantially higher. These servers are needed
because network operators are not complying with the guidance in RFC 1918.
  
192.42.172.0/24: NeXT-Default:

Legecy use for autoconfig of NeXT machines, e.g. Cubes, Slabs, PC's
and even some NeXTstep-sparcs. Some older Apple OS may use this.
Current Apple OS (Mac OS X) does -NOT- use this space.


198.18.0.0/15: from RFC-2544:
C.2.2 Protocol Addresses

   Two sets of addresses must be defined: first the addresses assigned
   to the router ports, and second the address that are to be used in
   the frames themselves and in the routing updates.

   The network addresses 192.18.0.0 through 198.19.255.255 are have been
   assigned to the BMWG by the IANA for this purpose.  This assignment
   was made to minimize the chance of conflict in case a testing device
   were to be accidentally connected to part of the Internet.


192.88.99.0/24: from RFC 3068:
2.3 6to4 Relay anycast prefix

   An IPv4 address prefix used to advertise an IPv4  route to an
   available 6to4 Relay Router, as defined in this memo.

   The value of this prefix is 192.88.99.0/24

Class D & E space. These are parts of the IPv4 space that retain some context
of class-fullness. They are used for identification of multicast and a range
left unspecified.  Multicast is perfectly legal and has valid public uses but
some care is required in understanding its appropriate use. The "E" space is
still unspecified and so should be avoided. This extract from RFC 1166 covers 
these ranges.

      The fourth type of address, class D, is used as a multicast
      address [13].  The four highest-order bits are set to 1-1-1-0.


                            1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |1 1 1 0|                  multicast address                    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Class D Address


      Note:  No addresses are allowed with the four highest-order bits
      set to 1-1-1-1.  These addresses, called "class E", are reserved.

Vendor Co-Opts:

As an operationalnote, at least one vendor has hijacked an address range for
use by its printservers. That range is 192.0.0.0/24 and the specific
address that they use is 192.0.0.192/32.  This is not a valid delegation
to this vendor and its use argues for re-constitution of this service
into the link-local range or configurable with site delegated space.



3. DNS considerations:

None of these address prefixes, save multicast, is to be used or visible on 
the public Internet.  In fact, some of these prefixes must not appear outside 
the machine. To encourage honesty, most of these prefixes have been mapped to 
authoritative servers in the DNS at the request of the IANA. This encourages 
people to ensure that when used, these prefixes are coded with local-scope 
DNS and there will be no "leakage" to the global Internet.

4. Access Control suggestions:

In todays network, it is prudent to control access. In the case of these
special use prefixes, it is generally a good idea to filter them so they
do not propagate. After all, you don't want someone else's use of these 
prefixes to taint your environment. All of these address classes should be 
invalid as source addresses (except where negotiated in advance), and very 
few should be permitted as destination addresses (Multicast for example, 
should be permitted as a destination, just not as a source).  An example of 
one form of access control is listed below:

...
access-list 100 deny   ip host 0.0.0.0 any
access-list 100 deny   ip 127.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 255.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
access-list 100 deny   ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 255.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
access-list 100 deny   ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 255.240.0.0 0.15.255.255
access-list 100 deny   ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 255.255.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 100 deny   ip 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 100 deny   ip 169.254.0.0 0.0.255.255 255.255.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 100 deny   ip 240.0.0.0 15.255.255.255 any
access-list 100 permit ip any any
...


5. Security Considerations:

Use of most of these special use prefixes open up significant opportunities 
for anonymity and ambiguity. People, being what they are, will hide behind 
ambiguous or nebulous identities to do things that are antisocial and 
downright hostile. It would be nice to have better authentication methods
in play than an IP address which has lost its global uniqueness.
