Introduction</h3>

<p>The so-called "lying NAS" problem is a well-documented
	problem with the current Extensible Authentication Protocol
	(EAP) architecture <a class='info' href='#RFC3748'>[RFC3748]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aboba, B., Blunk, L., Vollbrecht, J., Carlson, J., and H. Levkowetz, &ldquo;Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> when used in
	pass-through authenticator mode.  Here, a Network Access
	Server (NAS), or pass-through authenticator, may represent one
	set of information (e.g. network identity, capabilities,
	configuration, etc) to the backend Authentication,
	Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure, while
	representing contrary information to EAP peers.  Another
	possibility is that the same false information could be
	provided to both the EAP peer and EAP server by the NAS. A "lying" entity can also be located anywhere on the AAA path between the NAS and the 
	EAP server. 
</p>
<p>This problem results when the same credentials are used to
      access multiple services that differ in some interesting
      property. The EAP server learns which client credentials are in
      use. The client knows which EAP credentials are used, but cannot
      distinguish between servers that use those credentials.
</p>
<p>As a concrete example, consider an organization with two
      different IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. One is a relatively
      low-security network for reading e-mail while the other has
      access to valuable confidential information. An access point on
      the e-mail network could act as a lying NAS, sending the SSID of
      the confidential network in its beacons. This access point could
      gain an advantage by doing so if it tricks clients intending to
      connect to the confidential network to connect to it and
      disclose confidential information.
</p>
<p>A similar problem can be observed in the context of roaming. Here, the lying entity is located in a visited service provider network,
     e.g. attempting to lure peers to connect to the network based on false advertized roaming rates. This is referred to as "lying provider" problem
     in the remainder of this document. The lying entity's motivation
     often is financial; the entity may be paid whenever peers roam to
     its service. However a lying entity in a provider network can
     gain access to traffic that it might not otherwise see.
</p>
<p>This document defines and implements EAP channel bindings to
	solve the lying NAS and the lying provider problems, using a process in which the EAP
	peer provides information about the characteristics of the
	service provided by the authenticator to the AAA server
	protected within the EAP method. 
	This allows the server to verify the authenticator is providing 
	information to the peer that is consistent with the information
	received from this authenticator as well as the information stored about this authenticator.

Terminology</h3>

<p>In this document, several words are used to signify the
        requirements of the specification.  These words are often
        capitalized. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
        "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
        as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Problem Statement</h3>

<p>In a <a class='info' href='#RFC4017'>[RFC4017]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stanley, D., Walker, J., and B. Aboba, &ldquo;Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Method Requirements for Wireless LANs,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> compliant EAP authentication, the
	EAP peer and EAP server mutually authenticate each other, and
	derive keying material.  However, when operating in pass-through
	mode, the EAP server can be far removed from the authenticator.
	A malicious or compromised authenticator may represent incorrect
	information about the network to the peer in an effort to
	affect its operation in some way.  Additionally, while an
	authenticator may not be compromised, other compromised elements
	in the network (such as proxies) could provide false information to the
	authenticator that it could simply be relaying to EAP peers.
	Hence, the goal must be to ensure that the authenticator is providing
	correct information to the EAP peer during the initial network
	discovery, selection, and authentication.
</p>
<p>There are two different types of networks to consider:
	enterprise networks and service provider networks.  In
	enterprise networks, assuming a single administrative domain,
	it is feasible for an EAP server to have information about
	all the authenticators in the network.  In service provider
	networks, global knowledge is infeasible due to indirection via
	roaming.  When a peer is outside its home administrative
	domain, the goal is to ensure that the level of service received
	by the peer is consistent with the contractual agreement
	between the two service providers. The same EAP server may
	need to support both types of networks. For example an
	enterprise may have a roaming agreement permitting its users
	to use the networks of third-party service providers. In these
	situations, the EAP server may authenticate for an enterprise
	and provider network. 
</p>
<p>The following are example attacks possible by
	presenting false network information to peers.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Enterprise Network: A corporate network may have multiple
	    virtual Lads (VLANs) running throughout their campus
	    network, and have IEEE 802.11 access points connected to
	    each VLAN.  Assume one VLAN connects users to the firewalled
	    corporate network, while the other connects users to a
	    public guest network.  The corporate network is assumed to
	    be free of adversarial elements, while the guest network is
	    assumed to possibly have malicious elements.  Access Points
	    on both VLANs are serviced by the same EAP server, but
	    broadcast different SSIDs to differentiate.  A compromised
	    access point connected to the guest network but not the
	    corporate network could advertise
	    the SSID of the corporate network in an effort to lure
	    peers to connect to a network with a false sense of
	    security regarding their traffic. Conditions and further
	    details of this attack can be found in the Appendix.
	    <br />
<br />

</li>
<li>Enterprise network: The EAP GSS-API mechanism <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;abfab&#8209;gss&#8209;eap]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hartman, S. and J. Howlett, &ldquo;A GSS-API Mechanism for the Extensible Authentication Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> mechanism provides
	    a way to use EAP to authenticate to mail servers, instant
	    messaging servers and other non-network services. Without
	    EAP channel binding, an attacker could trick the user into
	    connecting to a relatively untrusted service instead of a
	    relatively trusted service.
</li>
<li>Service Provider Network: An EAP-enabled mobile phone provider could advertize very competitive flat rates 
	    but send per minute rates to the home server, thus, luring peers to connect to their network and overcharging them.
	    In more elaborate attacks, peers can be tricked into roaming without their knowledge. For example, 
	    a mobile phone provider operating along a geo-political boundary could
	    boost their cell towers' transmission power and advertise
	    the network identity of the neighboring country's indigenous
	    provider.  This would cause unknowing handsets to associate
	    with an unintended operator, and consequently be subject to
	    high roaming fees without realizing they had roamed off
	    their home provider's network.
 
	    These types of scenarios can be considered as "lying provider" problem, because here the
	    provider configures its NAS to broadcast false information. For the purpose of channel bindings as defined in
	    this draft, it does not matter which local entity (or
	    entities) is "lying" in a service provider network (local
	    NAS, local authentication server and/or local proxies),
	    because the only information received from the visited
	    network that is verified by channel bindings is the
	    information the home authentication server received from the
	    last hop in the communication chain. In other words, channel
	    bindings enable the detection of inconsistencies in the
	    information from a visited network, but cannot determine
	    which entity is lying.  Naturally, channel bindings for EAP
	    methods can only verify the endpoints and, if desirable,
	    intermediate hops need to be protected by the employed AAA
	    protocol.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>Enterprise and provider networks: In a situation where an
	    enterprise has roaming agreements with providers, a
	    compromised access point in a provider network could
	    masquerade as the enterprise network in an attempt to gain
	    confidential information. Today this could potentially be
	    solved by using different credentials for internal and
	    external access. Depending on the type of credential this
	    may introduce usability or man-in-the-middle security issues.
</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these problems, a mechanism is required to validate
	unauthenticated information advertised by EAP
	authenticators.

Channel Bindings</h3>

<p>EAP channel bindings seek to authenticate previously
	unauthenticated information provided by the authenticator to
	the EAP peer, by allowing the peer and server to compare
	their perception of network properties in a secure
	channel.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the definition of EAP channel
	bindings differs somewhat from channel bindings documented in
	<a class='info' href='#RFC5056'>[RFC5056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Williams, N., &ldquo;On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, which seek to securely bind together
	the end points of a multi-layer protocol, allowing lower
	layers to protect data from higher layers.  Unlike
	<a class='info' href='#RFC5056'>[RFC5056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Williams, N., &ldquo;On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, EAP channel bindings do not ensure
	the binding of different layers of a session but rather the
	information advertised to EAP peer by an authenticator
	acting as pass-through device during an EAP execution. The
	term channel bindings was independently adopted by these two
	related concepts; by the time the conflict was discovered, a
	wide body of literature existed for each usage. EAP channel
	bindings could be used to provide RFC 5056 channel
	bindings. In particular, an inner EAP method could be bound to an
	outer method by including the RFC 5056 channel binding data
	for the outer channel in the inner EAP method's channel
	bindings. Doing so would provide a facility similar to EAP
	cryptographic binding, except that a man-in-the-middle could
	not extract the inner method from the tunnel. This
	specification does not weigh the advantages of doing so nor
	specify how to do so; the example is provided only to
	illustrate how EAP channel binding and RFC 5056 channel
	binding overlap.

Types of EAP Channel Bindings</h3>

<p>There are two categories of approach to EAP channel bindings:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>After keys have been derived during an EAP execution,
	      the peer and server can, in an integrity-protected
	      channel, exchange plaintext information about the
	      network with each other, and verify consistency and
	      correctness.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>The peer and server can both uniquely encode their respective view of the network information without exchanging it, 
	      resulting into an opaque blob that can be included directly into the derivation of EAP session keys.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Both approaches are only applicable to key deriving EAP
	  methods and both have advantages and disadvantages.  Various hybrid approaches are also possible.  Advantages of
	  exchanging plaintext information include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It allows for policy-based comparisons of network
	      properties, rather than requiring precise matches for
	      every field, which achieves a policy-defined
	      consistency, rather than bitwise equality.  This allows
	      network operators to define which properties are
	      important and even verifiable in their
	      network.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>EAP methods that support extensible,
	      integrity-protected channels can easily include support
	      for exchanging this network information.  In contrast,
	      direct inclusion into the key derivation would require
	      more extensive revisions to existing EAP methods or a wrapper EAP
	      method.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>Given it doesn't affect the key derivation, this
	      approach facilitates debugging, incremental deployment,
	      backward compatibility and a logging mode in which
	      verification results are recorded but do not have an
	      effect on the remainder of the EAP execution. The exact
	      use of the verification results can be subject to the
	      network policy.  Additionally, consistent information
	      canonicalization and formatting for the key derivation
	      approach would likely cause significant deployment
	      problems.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are advantages of directly including channel
	  binding information in the key derivation:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>EAP methods not supporting extensible,
	      integrity-protected channels could still be supported,
	      either by revising their key derivation, revising EAP,
	      or wrapping them in a universal method that supports
	      channel binding.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>It can guarantee proper channel information, since
	      subsequent communication would be impossible if
	      differences in channel information yielded different
	      session keys on the EAP peer and server.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Channel Bindings in the Secure Association
	Protocol</h3>

<p>This document describes channel bindings performed by
	transporting channel binding information as part of an
	integrity-protected exchange within an EAP
	method. Alternatively, some future document could specify a
	mechanism for transporting channel bindings within the lower
	layer's secure association protocol. Such a specification
	would need to describe how channel bindings are exchanged
	over the lower layer protocol between the peer and
	authenticator. In addition, since the EAP exchange concludes
	before the secure association protocol begins, a mechanism for
	transporting the channel bindings from the authenticator to
	the EAP server needs to be specified. A mechanism for
	transporting a protected result from the EAP server, through
	the authenticator, back to the peer needs to be
	specified.
</p>
<p>The channel bindings MUST be transported with integrity
	protection based on a key known only to the peer and EAP
	server. The channel bindings SHOULD be confidentiality
	protected using a key known only to the peer and EAP
	server. For the system to function, the EAP server  or AAA
	server needs
	access to the channel binding information from the peer as
	well as the AAA attributes and a local database described
	later in this document.
</p>
<p>The primary advantage of sending channel bindings as part
	of the secure association protocol is that EAP methods need
	not be changed. The disadvantage is that a new AAA exchange is
	required, and secure association protocols need to be
	changed. As the result of the secure association protocol
	change, every NAS needs to be upgraded to support channel
	bindings within the secure association protocol.
</p>
<p>For many deployments, changing all the NASes is expensive
	and adding channel binding support to enough EAP methods to
	meet the goals of the deployment will be cheaper. However for
	deployment of new equipment, or especially deployment of a new
	lower layer technology, changing the NASes may be cheaper than
	changing EAP methods. Especially if such a deployment needed
	to support a large number of EAP methods, sending channel
	bindings in the secure association protocol might make
	sense.
</p>
<p>If channel bindings using a secure association protocol is
	specified, semantics as well as the set of information that
	peers exchange can be shared with the mechanism described in
	this document.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Channel Bindings Scope</h3>

<p>The scope of EAP channel bindings differs somewhat
	  depending on the type of deployment in which they are being
	  used.  In enterprise networks, they can be used to
	  authenticate very specific properties of the authenticator
	  (e.g. MAC address, supported link types and data rates,
	  etc), while in service provider networks they can generally
	  only authenticate broader information about a roaming
	  partner's network (e.g. network name, roaming information,
	  link security requirements, etc).  The reason for the
	  difference has to do with the amount of information about the authenticator
	  and/or network to which the peer is connected the home EAP
	  server is expected  to have access to.  In roaming
	  cases, the home server is likely to only have access to information
	  contained in their roaming agreements.
</p>
<p>With any multi-hop AAA infrastructure, many of the NAS-specific
	  AAA attributes are obscured by the AAA proxy that's
	  decrypting, reframing, and retransmitting the underlying AAA
	  messages.  Especially service provider networks are affected
	  by this and the AAA information received from the last hop may
	  not contain much verifiable information any longer. For
	  example, information carried in AAA attributes such as the NAS IP address may have been lost in transition and are thus not 
	  known to the EAP server.  This affects the ability of the
	  EAP server to verify specific NAS properties.  However,
	  often verification of the MAC or IP address of the NAS is
	  not useful for improving the overall security posture of a
	  network.  More often it is useful to make policy decisions
	  about services being offered to peers.  For example, in an
	  IEEE 802.11 network, the EAP server may wish to ensure that
	  peers connecting to the corporate intranet are using
	  secure link-layer encryption, while link-layer security
	  requirements for peers connecting to the guest network
	  could be less stringent.  These types of policy decisions
	  can be made without knowing or being able to verify the IP
	  address of the NAS through which the peer is connecting.
</p>
<p>The properties of the network that the peer wishes to
	  validate depend on the specific deployment. In a mobile phone network, peers generally don't care what
	  the name of the network is, as long as they can make their
	  phone call and are charged the expected amount for the call.
	  However, in an enterprise network the administrators of a peer may be more
	  concerned with specifics of where their network traffic is
	  being routed and what VLAN is in use. To establish policies
	  surrounding these requirements administrators would capture
	  some attribute such as SSID to describe the properties of
	  the network they care about. Channel bindings could validate
	  the SSID. The administrator would need to make sure that the
	  network guarantees that when an authenticator trusted by the
	  AAA infrastructure to offer a particular SSID to clients
	  does offer this SSID, that network has the intended
	  properties. Generally it is not possible for channel
	  bindings to detect lying NAS behavior when the NAS is
	  authorized to claim a particular service. That is, if the
	  same physical authenticator is permitted to advertize two
	  networks, the AAA infrastructure is unlikely to be able to
	  determine when this authenticator lyes.
</p>
<p>As discussed in the next section, some of the most
	important information to verify cannot come from AAA
	attributes but instead comes from local configuration. For
	example in the mobile phone case, the expected roaming rate
	cannot come from the roaming provider without being verified
	against the contract between the two providers. Similarly, in
	an enterprise, the SSID a particular access point is expected
	to advertize is a matter of configuration rather than
	something that can be trusted because it is included in an AAA
	exchange.
</p>
<p>Channel bindings can be important for forming pockets of
	trust, especially when provider networks are involved, and
	exact information is not available to the EAP server.  Without
	channel bindings, all entities in the system need to be held
	to the standards of the most trusted entity that could be
	accessed using the EAP credential. Otherwise, a less trusted
	entity can impersonate a more trusted entity. However when
	channel bindings are used, the EAP server can use information
	supplied by the peer, AAA protocols and local database to
	distinguish less trusted entities from more trusted
	entities. One possible deployment involves being able to
	verify a number of characteristics about relatively trusted
	entities while for other entities simply verifying that they
	are less trusted.
</p>
<p>Any deployment of channel bindings should take into
	  consideration both what information the EAP server is likely
	  to know or have access to, and also what type of network information the peer
	  would want and need authenticated.

Channel Binding Protocol</h3>

<p>This section defines the protocol for verifying channel binding
	information during an EAP authentication.  The protocol uses
	the approach where  plaintext data is exchanged, since it
	allows channel bindings to be used more flexibly in varied
	deployment models (see <a class='info' href='#bindingtypes'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Types of EAP Channel Bindings</span><span>)</span></a>). In the first subsection, the general communication infrastructure is outlined,
        the messages used for channel binding verifications are specified, and the protocol flows are defined. 
	The second subsection explores the difficulties of checking the different pieces of information that are exchanged during the channel binding 
	protocol for consistency.

Protocol Operation</h3>

<p>Channel bindings are always provided between two
	  communication endpoints, here the EAP peer and the EAP server, who
	  communicate through an authenticator typically in pass-through mode. For the channel binding protocol presented in this draft to work, 
	  the EAP server needs to be able to access information from the AAA server that is utilized during the EAP session and a 
	  local database. For example, the EAP server and the local database can be co-located with the AAA server, as illustrated in 
	  <a class='info' href='#chbinddiag'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview of Channel Binding 	  Protocol</span><span>)</span></a>. An alternate architecture would
	  be to provide a mechanism for the EAP server to inform the
	  AAA server what channel binding attributes were supplied and
	  the AAA server to inform the EAP server about what channel
	  binding attributes it considered when making its decision.

<p>During network advertisement, selection, and authentication,
	  the authenticator presents unauthenticated information,
	  labeled i1, about the network to the peer.  Message i1 could include an authenticator identifier and
	  the identity of the network it represents, in addition to
	  advertised network information such as offered services and
	  roaming information. Information may be communicated implicitly in i1,
           such as the type of media in use. As there is no established trust
	  relationship between the peer and authenticator, there is no
	  way for the peer to validate this information.
</p>
<p>Additionally, during the transaction the authenticator
	  presents a number of information properties in form of AAA attributes about itself and the current request to
	  the AAA infrastructure which may or may not be valid. This information is labeled i2. 
	  Message i2 is the information the AAA server receives from
	  the last hop in the AAA proxy chain which is not necessarily
	  the authenticator.
</p>
<p>AAA hops between the authenticator and AAA server can
	validate some of I2. Whether the AAA server will be able to
	depend on this depends significantly on the business
	relationship executed with these proxies and on the structure
	of the AAA network.
</p>
<p>The local database is perhaps the most important part of
	  this system.  In order for the EAP server or AAA server  to know whether i1
	  and i2 are correct, they need access to trustworthy information, since
	  an authenticator could include false information in both i1
	  and i2. Additional reasons why  such a database is necessary for channel bindings to work are discussed in the next subsection.
	  The information contained within the database could
	  involve wildcards.  For example, this could be used to
	  check whether WiFi access points on a particular IP subnet
	  all use a specific SSID.  The exact IP address is
	  immaterial, provided it is on the correct subnet.
</p>
<p>During an EAP method execution with channel bindings,  the
	  peer sends i1 to the EAP server using the mechanism
	  described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.clancy-emu-aaapay'>[I&#8209;D.clancy&#8209;emu&#8209;aaapay]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clancy, T., Lior, A., and G. Zorn, Ed., &ldquo;EAP Method Support for Transporting AAA Payloads,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. the EAP
	  server verifies  the consistency of i1 provided by 
	  the peer, i2 provided by the authenticator, and the information in the local database. Upon the check, the EAP server 
	  sends a message to the peer indicating whether the channel
	  binding validation check succeeded or failed and  includes
	  the attributes  thatwere used in the check. The message flow
	  is illustrated in <a class='info' href='#chbinddiag'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview of Channel Binding 	  Protocol</span><span>)</span></a>. The
	  appropriate sections of that draft will be folded into this
	  document in the next version. Note that the 1.5-round-trip
	  exchange described in that draft is not used. Also, for
	  methods such as TTLS that can carry diameter AVPs directly,
	  an AVP indicating that the carried data is for channel
	  bindings will still be used.
</p>
<p>If the compliance of i1 or i2 information with the authoritative
	  policy source is mandatory and a consistency check failed, then after
	  sending a protected indication of failed consistency, the
	  EAP server MUST send an EAP-Failure message to terminate the
	  session.  If the EAP server is otherwise configured, it MUST
	  allow the EAP session to complete normally, and leave the
	  decision about network access up to the peer's policy.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Channel Binding Consistency Check</h3>

<p>The validation check that is the core of the channel binding protocol described in the previous subsection,
	  consists of two parts in which the server checks whether:<br />
<br />


	</p>
<ol class="text">
<li> the authenticator is lying to the peer, i.e. i1 contains false information, <br />
<br />
 
</li>
<li> the authenticator or any entity on the AAA path to the AAA server provides false information in form of AAA attributes, 
	      i.e. i2 contains false information, <br />
<br />
 
</li>
</ol><p>

	 These checks enable the EAP server to detect lying NAS/authenticator in enterprise networks and lying providers in service provider networks. 
	 
</p>
<p>Checking the consistency of i1 and i2 is nontrivial, as has been pointed out already in <a class='info' href='#HC07'>[HC07]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hoeper, K. and L. Chen, &ldquo;Where EAP Security Claims Fail,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	First, i1 can contain any type of information propagated by the authenticator, 
	whereas i2 is restricted to information that can be carried in AAA attributes. Second, because the authenticator typically  
	communicates over different link layers with the peer and the AAA infrastructure, different type of identifiers and addresses may have been 
	presented to both communication endpoints. Whether these different identifiers and addresses belong to the same device cannot be directly 
	checked by the EAP server or AAA server without additional information. Finally, i2 may be different from
	the original information sent by the authenticator because
	of en route processing or malicious modifications.  As a
	result, in the service provider model, typically the i1 information available to the EAP
	server can only be verified against the last-hop portion of i2, or
	values propagated by proxy servers. In addition, checking the consistency of i1 and i2
	  alone is insufficient because an authenticator could lie to both, the peer and 
	  the EAP server, i.e. i1 and i2 may be consistent but both contain false information.
</p>
<p>A local database is required to leverage the above mentioned shortcomings and support the consistency and validation checks. In particular, 
	 information stored for each NAS/authenticator (enterprise scenario) or each roaming partner (service provider scenario) enables 
	 a comparison of any information received in i1 with AAA attributes in i2 as well as additionally stored AAA attributes 
	 that might have gone lost in transition. Furthermore, only such a database enables the EAP server and AAA server to check
	  the received information against trusted information about the network including roaming agreements. 
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#l2bindings'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channel Binding TLV</span><span>)</span></a> describes lower-layer

          reports back the results from the channel binding validation check that compares the 
          consistency of all the values with those in the local 
          database. The challenges of setting up such a local database

System Requirements</h3>

<p>This section defines requirements on components used to

</p>
<p>The channel binding protocol defined in this document must
	  be transported after keying material has been derived
	  between the EAP peer and server, and before the peer would
	  suffer adverse affects from joining an adversarial
	  network. This document describes a protocol for performing
	  channel binding within EAP methods. As discussed in <a class='info' href='#SAP'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channel Bindings in the Secure Association 	Protocol</span><span>)</span></a>, an alternative approach for meeting this

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
General Transport Protocol Requirements</h3>

<p>The transport protocol for carrying channel binding
	    information MUST support end-to-end (i.e. between the EAP
	    peer and server) message integrity protection to prevent
	    the adversarial NAS or AAA device from manipulating the
	    transported data.  The transport protocol SHOULD provide
	    confidentiality.  The motivation for this that the channel
	    bindings could contain private information, including peer
	    identities, which SHOULD be protected. 
	    If confidentiality cannot be provided, private information MUST NOT be sent as part of the channel binding information.
</p>
<p>One way to transport the single round-trip exchange is as
	    a series of TLVs formatted and encapsulated in
	    EAP methods. These TLVs carry different types of data.  Since i2 messages are carried within a AAA protocol it is useful to define one 
	    type of data carried as AAA AVPs, but other types of data may be defined that are not carried in AAA attributes and are only compared
	    against the information stored in the local database.  This document describes some AAA attributes that are useful for channel binding checks. 
	    Additionally, guidance on how to
	    perform consistency checks on those values will be
	    provided.  Since the Diameter namespace contains the RADIUS namespace the TLVs of AAA AVP type carry Diameter attributes. 
</p>
<p>Any transport needs to be careful not to exceed the MTU
	    for its lower-layer medium.  In particular, if channel
	    binding information is exchanged within protected EAP
	    method channels, these methods may or may not support
	    fragmentation.  In order to work with all methods, the
	    channel binding messages must fit within the available
	    payload.  For example, if the EAP MTU is 1020 octets, and
	    EAP-GPSK is used as the authentication method, and
	    maximal-length identities are used, a maximum of 384
	    octets are available for conveying channel binding
	    information.  Other methods, such as EAP-TTLS, support
	    fragmentation and could carry significantly longer
	    payloads.

Channel Binding TLV</h3>

<p>This section defines some channel binding TLVs. While message i1 is not limited to AAA attributes, for the sake of tangible attributes that are already in place, this
	  section discusses AAA AVPs that are appropriate for carrying channel bindings (i.e. data from i1 in
	  <a class='info' href='#chbp'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channel Binding Protocol</span><span>)</span></a>). In particular, attributes for IEEE
	  802.11 are provided, which can be used as a template for developing
	  bindings for other EAP lower-layer protocols. 
</p>
<p>For any lower-layer protocol, network information of
	  interest to the peer and server can be encapsulated in AVPs or other defined payload containers.
	  The appropriate AVPs depend on the lower layer protocol as
	  well as on the network type (i.e. enterprise network or
	  service provider network) and its application. Additional TLV types can be defined beyond AAA AVPs.  For example it may be useful to define TLVs that can carry 802.11 information elements.

Requirements for Lower-Layer Bindings</h3>

<p>Lower-layer protocols MUST support EAP in order to

	    support EAP methods that derive keying material, as
	    otherwise no integrity-protected channel would be

	    Lower-layer protocols need not support traffic encryption,
	    since this is independent of the authentication phase.
	    
</p>
<p>Any binding value that is communicated in AAA MUST be encoded as a Diameter AVP.  The data conveyed within
	    the AVP type MUST NOT conflict with the externally-defined
	    usage of the AVP. Additional TLV types SHOULD be defined for values that are not communicated within AAA attributes.

Trust Model</h3>

<p>In the considered  trust model, EAP peer and authentication server are honest while the
	    authenticator is maliciously sending false information to
	    peer and/or server.  In the model, the peer and server
	    trust each other, which is not an unreasonable assumption, considering
	    they already have a trust relationship.  The following are the trust
	    relationships:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The server trusts that the channel binding information
		received from the peer is the information that the peer	received from the authenticator.
</li>
<li>The peer trusts the channel binding result received from
		the server.
</li>
<li>The server trusts the information contained within its
		local database.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to establish the first two trust relationships during
	    an EAP execution, an EAP method needs to provide the following:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>mutual authentication between peer and server
</li>
<li>derivation of keying material including a key for
		integrity protection of channel binding messages
</li>
<li>sending i1 from peer to server over an
		integrity-protected channel
</li>
<li>sending the result and optionally i2 from server to
		peer over an integrity-protected channel
</li>
</ul>

<a name="rfc.section.9.2"></a><h3>9.2.&nbsp;
Consequences of Trust Violation</h3>

<p>If any of the trust relationships listed in <a class='info' href='#trustmodel'>Section&nbsp;9.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Trust Model</span><span>)</span></a> are
	    violated, channel binding cannot be provided. In other
	    words, if mutual authentication with key establishment as
	    part of the EAP method as well as protected database access
	    are not provided, then achieving channel binding is not
	    feasible.
</p>
<p>Dishonest peers can only manipulate the first message i1 of
	    the channel binding protocol.  In this scenario, a peer
	    sends i1’ to the server. If i1’ is invalid, the channel
	    binding validation will fail.  On the other hand if i1’ passes the
	    validation, either the original i1 was wrong and i1’
	    corrected the problem or both i1 and i1’ constitute valid
	    information.  A peer could potentially gain an advantage
	    in auditing or charging if both are valid and information
	    from i1 is used for auditing or charging. Such peers can
	    be detected by including the information in i2 and
	    checking i1 against i2.
</p>
<p>Dishonest servers can send EAP-Failure messages and abort
	    the EAP authentication even if the received i1 is valid.
	    However, servers can always abort any EAP session
	    independent of whether channel binding is offered or not.
	    On the other hand, dishonest servers can claim a successful
	    validation even if i1 contains invalid information.  This can be seen as
	    collaboration of authenticator and server.  Channel binding
	    can neither prevent nor detect such attacks.  In general
	    such attacks cannot be prevented by cryptographic means and
	    should be addressed using policies making servers liable for
	    their provided information and services.
</p>
<p>Additional network entities (such as proxies) might be on
	    the communication path between peer and server and may
	    attempt to manipulate the channel binding protocol. If these
	    entities do not possess the keying material used for
	    integrity protection of the channel binding messages, the
	    same threat analysis applies as for the dishonest
	    authenticators.  Hence, such entities can neither manipulate
	    single channel binding messages nor the outcome.  On the
	    other hand, entities with access to the keying material must
	    be treated like a server in a threat analysis.  Hence such
	    entities are able to manipulate the channel binding protocol
	    without being detected.  However, the required knowledge of
	    keying material is unlikely since channel binding is
	    executed before the EAP method is completed, and thus before
	    keying material is typically transported to other
	    entities.

Privacy Violations</h3>

<p>While the channel binding information exchanged between EAP
	    peer and EAP server (i.e. i1 and the optional result
	    message) must always be integrity-protected it may not be
	    encrypted. In the case that these messages contain
	    identifiers of peer and/or network entities, the privacy
	    property of the executed EAP method may be violated. Hence,
	    in order to maintain the privacy of an EAP method, the
	    exchanged channel binding information must be encrypted. 
	    If encryption is not available, private information is not sent as part of the channel binding information, as described in 
	  <a class='info' href='#req_tranport'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>General Transport Protocol Requirements</span><span>)</span></a>.

Operations and Management Considerations</h3>

<p>As with any extension to existing protocols, there will be an
            impact on existing systems.  Typically the goal is to develop
            an extension that minimizes the impact on both development and
            deployment of the new system, subject to the system
            requirements.  This section  discusses the impact on
            existing devices that currently utilize EAP, assuming the
            channel binding information is transported within the EAP
            method execution.
</p>
<p>The EAP peer will need an API between the EAP lower layer and
	    the EAP method that exposes the necessary information from the
	    NAS to be validated to the EAP peer, which can then feed that
	    information into the EAP methods for transport.  For example,
	    an IEEE 802.11 system would need to make available the various
	    information elements that require validation to the EAP peer
	    which would properly format them and pass them to the EAP
	    method.  Additionally, the EAP peer will require updated EAP
	    methods that support transporting channel binding information.
	    While most method documents are written modularly to allow
	    incorporating arbitrary protected information, implementations
	    of those methods would need to be revised to support these
	    extensions.  Driver updates are also required so methods can
            access the required information.
</p>
<p>No changes to the pass-through authenticator would be
            required.
</p>
<p>The EAP server would need an API between the database storing
	    NAS information and the individual EAP server.  The
	    database may  already exist on the AAA server in which case the EAP server
	    passes the parameters to the AAA server for validation. The EAP
	    methods need to be able to export received channel binding
	    information to the EAP server so it can be validated.

Enterprise Subnetwork Masquerading</h3>

<p>As outlined in <a class='info' href='#probstate'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Problem Statement</span><span>)</span></a>, an enterprise network may have
	  multiple VLANs providing different levels of security. In an
	  attack, a malicious NAS connecting to a guest network with
	  lesser security protection could broadcast the SSID of a
	  subnetwork with higher protection. This could lead peers
	  to believe that they are accessing the network over secure
	  connections, and, e.g., transmit confidential information
	  that they normally would not send over a weakly protected
	  connection. This attack works under the conditions that
	  peers use the same set of credentials to authenticate to
	  the different kinds of VLANs and that the VLANs support at
	  least one common EAP method. If these conditions are not
	  met, the EAP server would not authorize the peers to
	  connect to the guest network, because the peers used
	  credentials and/or an EAP method that is associated with the
	  corporate network.

Forced Roaming</h3>

<p>Mobile phone providers boosting their cell tower's
	  transmission power to get more users to use their networks
	  have occurred in the past. The increased transmission range
	  combined with a NAS sending a false network identity lures
	  users to connect to the network without being aware of that
	  they are roaming. 
</p>
<p>Channel bindings would detect the bogus network identifier
	  because the network identifier send to the authentication
	  server in i1 will neither match information i2 nor the
	  stored data. The verification fails because the info in i1
	  claims to come from the peer’s home network while the home
	  authentication server knows that the connection is through a
	  visited network outside the home domain. In the same
	  context, channel bindings can be utilized to provide a "home
	  zone" feature that notifies users every time they are about
	  to connect to a NAS outside their home domain.

<a name="rfc.section.A.3"></a><h3>A.3.&nbsp;
Downgrading attacks</h3>

<p>A malicious authenticator could modify the set of offered
	    EAP methods in its Beacon to force the peer to choose from
	    only the weakest EAP method(s) accepted by the
	    authentication server. For instance, instead of having a
	    choice between EAP-MD5-CHAP, EAP-FAST and some other
	    methods, the authenticator reduces the choice for the peer
	    to the weaker EAP-MD5-CHAP method. Assuming that weak EAP
	    methods are supported by the authentication server, such a
	    downgrading attack can enable the authenticator to attack
	    the integrity and confidentiality of the remaining EAP
	    execution and/or break the authentication and key
	    exchange.  The presented channel bindings prevent such
	    downgrading attacks, because peers submit the offered EAP
	    method selection that they have received in the beacon as
	    part of i1 to the authentication server. As a result, the
	    authentication server recognizes the modification when
	    comparing the information to the respective information in
	    its policy database.

Bogus Beacons in IEEE 802.11r</h3>

<p>In IEEE 802.11r, the SSID is bound to the TSK
	    calculations, so that the TSK needs to be consistent with
	    the SSID advertised in an authenticator’s Beacon. While
	    this prevents outsiders from spoofing a Beacon it does not
	    stop a "lying NAS" from sending a bogus Beacon and
	    calculating the TSK accordingly.
</p>
<p>By implementing channel bindings, as described in this
	    draft, in IEEE 802.11r, the verification by the
	    authentication server would detect the inconsistencies
	    between the information the authenticator has sent to the
	    peer and the information the server received from the
	    authenticator and stores in the policy database.

<a name="rfc.section.A.5"></a><h3>A.5.&nbsp;
Forcing false authorization in IEEE 802.11i</h3>

<p>In IEEE 802.11i a malicious NAS can modify the beacon to
	    make the peer believe it is connected to a network
	    different from the on the peer is actually connected
	    to.
</p>
<p>In addition, a malicious NAS can force an authentication
	    server into authorizing access by sending an incorrect
	    Called-Station-ID that belongs to an authorized NAS in the
	    network. This could cause the authentication server to
	    believe it had granted access to a different network or
	    even provider than the one the peer got access to.
</p>
<p>Both attacks can be prevented by implementing channel
	    bindings, because the server can compare the information
	    that was sent to the peer, with information it received
	    from the authenticator during the AAA communication as
	    well as the information stored in the policy database.

</li>
<li>Update discussion of the architecture. Talk about
	    channel bindings as a mechanism to introduce levels of

</li>
<li>Claim that we're using the encoding from
	    draft-clancy-emu-aaapay. The WG almost certainly doesn't
	    have consensus on this, but in the interest of actually
	    describing what the protocol might be like, it is a good
