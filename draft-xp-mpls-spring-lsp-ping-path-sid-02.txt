1.  Introduction

   Path Segment is a type of SR segment, which is used to identify an SR
   path.  Path Segment in MPLS based segment routing network is defined
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment].

   When Path Segment is used, it's inserted by the ingress node of the
   SR path, and then processed by the egress node of the SR path.  The
   position of Path Segment Label within the MPLS label stack is
   immediately following the segment list of the SR path.  Note that the
   Path Segment would not be popped up until it reaches the egress node.

   This document provides Target Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
   stack TLV definitions for Path-SIDs.  Procedures for LSP Ping as
   defined in [RFC8287] and [RFC8690] are applicable to Path-SIDs as
   well.

2.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC8402] and
   [RFC8029], readers are expected to be familiar with those terms.

3.  Path Segment ID Sub-TLV

   Analogous to what's defined in Section 5 of [RFC8287] and Section 4
   of [I-D.ietf-mpls-sr-epe-oam], two new sub-TLVs are defined for the
   Target FEC Stack TLV (Type 1), the Reverse-Path Target FEC Stack TLV
   (Type 16), and the Reply Path TLV (Type 21).


        Sub-Type    Sub-TLV Name
        --------    -----------------------------
         TBD1       SR Candidate Path's Path SID
         TBD2       SR Segment List's Path SID

   As specified in Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-path-segment],
   the Path Segment can be used to identify an SR path (specified by SID
   list) or an SR candidate path, so two different Target FEC sub-TLVs
   need to be defined for Path Segment ID.  When a Path Segment is used
   to identify an SR path, then the Target FEC sub-TLV of SR Segment
   List's Path SID would be used to validate the control plane to
   forwarding plane synchronization for this Path-SID; When a Path
   Segment is used to identify an SR candidate path, then the Target FEC
   sub-TLV of SR Candidate Path's Path SID would be used to validate the
   control plane to forwarding plane synchronization for this Path-SID.
   Note that the two new Target FEC sub-TLVs are mutual exclusive and
   they wouldn't be present in one message simultaneously.

3.1.  SR Candidate Path's Path SID

   The format of SR Candidate Path's Path SID sub-TLV is as specified
   below:

      This field identifies the headend of an SR Policy, the same as
      defined in Section 2.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The headend is a
      4-octet IPv4 address or a 16-octet IPv6 address.

   Color

      This field associates the SR Policy with an intent, the same as
      defined in Section 2.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The color is a 4-octet
      numerical value.

   Endpoint

      This field identifies the endpoint of an SR Policy, the same as
      defined in Section 2.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The endpoint is a
      4-octet IPv4 address or a 16-octet IPv6 address.

   Protocol-Origin

      This field identifies the component or protocol that originates or
      signals the candidate path for an SR Policy, the same as defined
      in Section 2.3 of [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The
      protocol-origin is a 1-octet value that follows the recommendation
      from Table 1 of Section 2.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], which specifies value 10
      for "PCEP", value 20 for "BGP SR Policy" and value 30 for "Via
      Configuration".

   Originator

      This field identifies the node which provisioned or signaled the
      candidate path for an SR Policy, the same as defined in
      Section 2.4 of [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The
      originator is a 20-octet numerical value formed by the
      concatenation of the fields of the tuple <ASN, node-address>,
      among which ASN is a 4-octet number and node address is a 16-octet
      value (an IPv6 address or an IPv4 address encoded in the lowest 4
      octets).  When Procotol-Origin is respectively "Via
      Configuration", or "PCEP", or "BGP SR Policy", the values of ASN
      and node address follow the specification in Section 2.4 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

      This field uniquely identifies a candidate path within the context
      of an SR policy, the same as defined in Section 2.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The discriminator is a
      4-octet value.  When Protocol-Origin is respectively "Via
      Configuration", or "PCEP", or "BGP SR Policy", the value of
      discriminator follows the specification in Section 2.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   Segment-List-ID

      This field identifies an SR path within the context of a candidate
      path of an SR Policy, the same as "Path ID" defined in Section 4.2
      of [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath], or "List Identifier" defined in
      Section 2.2 of [I-D.lp-idr-sr-path-protection].  The segment-list-
      ID is a 4-octet identifier of the corresponding segment list.

4.  Path-SID FEC Validation

   The MPLS LSP Ping procedures MAY be initiated by the headend of the
   Segment Routing path or a centralized topology-aware data plane
   monitoring system as described in [RFC8403].  For the Path-SID, the
   responder nodes that receive echo request and send echo reply MUST be
   the endpoint of the Segment Routing path.

   When an endpoint receives the LSP echo request packet with top FEC
   being the Path-SID, it SHOULD perform validity checks on the content
   of the Path-SID FEC sub-TLV.  The basic length check should be
   performed on the received FEC.


       SR Candidate Path's Path SID
       ------------------
       Length = 40 or 64

       SR Segment List's Path SID
       ------------------
       Length = 44 or 68

   If a malformed FEC sub-TLV is received, then a return code of 1,
   "Malformed echo request received" as defined in [RFC8029] SHOULD be
   sent.  The below section augments the section 7.4 of [RFC8287].

      4a.  Segment Routing Path-SID Validation:

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and the Target FEC Stack sub-TLV at
      FEC-stack-depth is TBD1 (SR Candidate Path's Path SID sub-TLV), {

      -  Set the Best-return-code to 10, "Mapping for this FEC is not
         the given label at stack-depth <RSC>" if any below conditions
         fail:

            +  When the Protocol-Origin field in the received SR
               Candidate Path's Path SID sub-TLV is 10, "PCEP" is used
               as the signaling protocol.  And then validate that the
               Path Segment ID matches with the tuple identifying the SR
               Candidate Path within PCEP {

               *  Validate that the signaled headend, color, end-point,
                  originator ASN, originator address and discriminator
                  defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp]
                  and [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-path-segment], for the Path SID,
                  matches with the corresponding fields in the received
                  SR Candidate Path's Path SID sub-TLV.

               }

            +  When the Protocol-Origin field in the received SR
               Candidate Path's Path SID sub-TLV is 20, "BGP SR Policy"
               is used as the signaling protocol.  And then validate
