                                   1. INTRODUCTION

            This section provides an overview of ISO/CCITT and Internet
            Management Coexistence (IIMC) activities, insight into the
            problem being addressed by IIMC, and a brief introduction to
            the strategy adopted by IIMC: use of translated MIBs in
            either a proxy or native implementation. The section
            concludes by describing the scope of this document, and
            terms and conventions used by this document.



            1.1  PROBLEM STATEMENT

            The need for enterprise network management has been
            addressed by development of network management standards
            within various communities, most notably the ISO/CCITT and
            Internet communities.

            *  The ISO/CCITT community developed the Common Management
               Information Protocol (CMIP) [5], and related SMI
               documents [7,8,9].

            *  The Internet community developed the Simple Network
               Management Protocol (SNMP) [12], and its successor,
               SNMPv2 [18]. The Internet SMI is defined in [11] and
               [17].

            These standards share a nearly common management model, but
            diverge due to differing management philosophies. Although
            functionally similar, the Internet and ISO/CCITT protocols
            and SMIs differ in terms of their complexity and specific
            operations. Business requirements for end-to-end enterprise
            management include the need to integrate the management of
            many different devices, potentially owned or administered by
            many independent organizations. This requires components to
            be accessed by ISO/CCITT management, Internet management,
            and proprietary management mechanisms in a manner which
            presents a unified view of the network, despite protocol and
            SMI differences.

            For example, many telecommunications and computer vendors,
            represented by organizations such as the Network Management
            Forum (NMF), and the U.S. government, as specified in the
            Government Network Management Profile (GNMP) Version 1.0
            [24], have based their enterprise management model on the
            ISO/CCITT management model. These organizations are
            particularly interested in integrated management of devices
            that use the Internet management. This interest is primarily
            due to the widespread commercial implementation and use of

            DRAFT         <draft-labarre-iimc-mibii-04.txt>  February, 1994


            such devices, especially devices that use the Internet
            TCP/IP protocol suite.



            1.2  OVERVIEW OF IIMC

            The ISO/CCITT and Internet Management Coexistence (IIMC)
            package includes the following documents.

            IIMCIMIBTRANS  Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT
                           GDMO MIBs [19]

            IIMCOMIBTRANS  Translation of ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs to
                           Internet MIBs [22]

            IIMCMIB-II     Translation of Internet MIB-II (RFC1213) to
                           ISO/CCITT GDMO MIB

            IIMCPROXY      ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Proxy [20]

            IIMCSEC        ISO/CCITT to Internet Management Security[21]

            These documents together comprise a package aimed at
            integrating ISO/CCITT-based and Internet-based management
            systems.

            IIMC specifications address the problem that end-to-end
            management requires an integrated, unified view of the
            managed network, despite differences in management protocol
            and information structure. Integrated management can be
            facilitated by the development of "proxy" mechanisms which
            translate between functionally equivalent service, protocol,
            and SMI differences to create this unified view. MIB
            translation procedures can be used to support proxy
            management, as well as to take advantage of existing MIB
            definition and avoid duplication of effort. In this way,
            commercial investment in both ISO/CCITT and Internet-based
            management technologies can be preserved through deployment
            of common methods and tools which support integration.

            This overall strategy was outlined in a joint publication
            developed by the NM Forum and X/Open entitled "ISO/CCITT and
            Internet Management: Coexistence and Interworking Strategy"
            [23]. The documents included in the IIMC package are the
            next level of detailed specifications which implement
            several of the methodologies identified in the strategy.
            Additional specifications may be defined in the future.

            1.3  MIB TRANSLATION PROCEDURES

            The foundation of IIMC is provided by a pair of Management
            Information Base (MIB) translation procedures.

            *  IIMCIMIBTRANS [19] specifies translation procedures for
               converting MIBs from Internet MIB macro format into
               ISO/CCITT GDMO template format.

            *  IIMCOMIBTRANS [22] specifies translation procedures for
               converting MIBs from ISO/CCITT GDMO template format into
               Internet MIB macro format.

            The IIMC approach is to specify direct translation
            procedures which yield a pair of functionally-equivalent
            MIBs, as shown in Figure 1.

            +----------------+     +--------------------+     +----------------+
            |  Internet MIB  |     |   MIB Translation  |     |    GDMO MIB    |
            |                |     |     Procedures     |     |                |
            |  Format =      |     |    Specified By    |     | Format =       |

            |  [RFC1442]     |<----| [IIMCOMIBTRANS]    |<----| [ISO10165-4]   |
            +----------------+     +--------------------+     +----------------+

                             Figure 1. MIB translation.

            MIBs translated by these procedures may be used to take
            advantage of existing MIB definitions when business needs
            require deployment in a different management environment.
            Translated MIBs may also be used to provide uniformity when
            multiple management environments are supported by a single
            system (e.g., dual stack managers). Finally, IIMC MIB
            translation procedures may be used to support service
            emulation by a proxy.

            The basic model for ISO/CCITT and Internet management is

                            Figure 2. Native management.

            Within IIMC documents, this model is referred to as the
            "native" management model. MIBs translated using IIMC
            procedures can be used by "native" agent implementations.
            For example, an ISO/CCITT agent can make visible TCP/IP
            managed resources using the translated GDMO version of the
            Internet MIB-II [14] specified by [19]. Dual-stack managers
            or agents may also be implemented which support both the
            original MIB and the translated MIB generated using IIMC-
            specified procedures.

            The basic model for ISO/CCITT to Internet proxy management
            is illustrated in the following diagram. This proxy is
            specified by [20]. A similar approach could also be taken to
            specify an Internet to ISO/CCITT proxy, although no such
            IIMC document is currently specified.

            This ISO/CCITT to Internet proxy provides emulation of CMIS
            services by mapping to the corresponding SNMP message(s)
            necessary to carry out the service request. The service
            emulation allows management of Internet objects by an
            ISO/CCITT manager. The left hand side of the proxy behaves
            like an ISO/CCITT agent, communicating with the ISO/CCITT
            manager using CMIP protocols. The right hand side of the
            proxy behaves like an Internet manager, communicating with
            the Internet agent using SNMP protocols.

            The proxy relies on the existence of a pair of directly-
            related MIB definitions, where the Internet MIB has been
            translated into ISO/CCITT GDMO using the procedures
            specified in IIMCIMIBTRANS. The proxy uses these MIB
            definitions and rules to provide run-time translation of

            management information carried in service requests and
            responses.

            The proxy is designed with a specified interface between the
            proxy and the underlying protocol stacks, and so deals
            primarily in terms of CMIS services and SNMP "services". The
            proxy emulates services such as CMIS scoping and filtering,
            processing of CMIP operations, and forwarding/logging of
            CMIS notifications by performing a mapping process which
            must be tailored for each protocol (for example, SNMPv1 and
            SNMPv2 are variants of the same protocol mapping process).



            1.6  SCOPE OF THIS DOCUMENT

            A major reason for the rapid commercialization of devices
            manageable via the Internet management protocol is due to
            the speed with which the vendors in the Internet community
            have been able to develop MIBs based on the Internet SMI.
            To capitalize on this continuing Internet MIB development
            and their deployment in commercial devices, communities
            interested in integrated management via CMIP/SNMP proxies,
            and communities interested in using native CMIP agents to
            manage TCP/IP resources, require the translation of Internet
            MIBs defined according to the Internet Structure of
            Management Information (SMI) [11] [17] into MIBs defined
            according to the ISO SMI [7] and Guidelines for the
            Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) [9]. Procedures for
            such translations are described in [19].

            This document (IIMCMIB-II) applies the procedures described
            in [19] to the translation and registration of the Internet
            MIB-II as defined in [14], and to the IP Forwarding Table
            defined in [15].

            This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
            ISO/CCITT SMI and  terminology as well as the Internet to
            SMI translation defined in [19].



            1.7  TERMS AND CONVENTIONS

            This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
            ISO/CCITT SMI and Internet SMI, and the terminology of each.
            The term SNMP will be used throughout the document to
            indicate either SNMPv1 or SNMPv2, unless a distinction needs
            to be made.

            Other terms and conventions used throughout this document
            include the following.

                                  2. IIMCMIB-II MIB

            The Internet MIB-II objects [14] are recast into ISO/CCITT
            GDMO templates as defined in [9], and registered, using the
            procedures defined in [19].

            Name Binding templates that define the containment hierarchy
            for the ISO/CCITT MIB-II managed object classes are listed.
            A proxy implementation would have multiple instances of the
            ISO/CCITT system managed object, one for each Internet
            agent, and one for the proxy itself.

            A Naming Tree diagram for IIMC MIB-II managed object classes
            is illustrated below.

                      !!This managed object class maps to the at group
                      with object id {mib-2 3} in RFC1213.!!;
                      DESCRIPTION
                      !!Note however that this group is deprecated by
                      MIB-II. That is, it is being included solely for
                      compatibility with MIB-I nodes, and will most
                      likely be excluded from MIB-III nodes. From MIB-II
                      and onwards, each network protocol group contains
                      its own address translation tables.

                      The Address Translation group contains one table
                      which is the union across all interfaces of the
                      translation tables for converting a NetworkAddress
                      (e.g., an IP address) into a subnetwork-specific
                      address. For lack of a better term, this document
                      refers to such a subnetwork-specific address as a
                      `physical' address.

                      Examples of such translation tables are: for
                      broadcast media where ARP is in use, the
                      translation table is equivalent to the ARP cache;
                      or, on an X.25 network where non-algorithmic
                      translation to X.121 addresses is required, the
                      translation table contains the NetworkAddress to
                      X.121 address equivalences.!!;

                      and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor
                      acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer
                      to return to the Idle state until a Start event
                      occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or

                      indicates the default path if no more  specific
                      policy applies.

                      !!The type of route.  Note that local(3)  refers
                      to  a route for which the next hop is the final
                      destination; remote(4) refers to a route for which
                      the next hop is not the final destination.

                      Setting this attribute to the value invalid(2) has
                      the  effect of invalidating the corresponding
                      ipForwardEntry. That is, it effectively
                      disassociates the destination identified with said
                      entry from the route identified with said entry.
                      It is an implementation-specific matter as to
                      whether the agent removes an invalidated entry
                      from the table. Accordingly, management stations
                      must be prepared to receive tabular information
                      from agents that corresponds to entries not
                      currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such
                      entries requires examining the relevant
                      ipForwardType attribute.!!;

                      DESCRIPTION
                      !!The type of route. Note that the values
                      direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of
                      direct and indirect routing in the IP
                      architecture.

                      Setting this attribute to the value invalid(2) has
                      the effect of invalidating the corresponding
                      ipRouteEntry. That is, it effectively
                      disassociates the destination identified with said
                      entry from the route identified with said entry.
                      It is an implementation-specific matter as to
                      whether the agent removes an invalidated entry
                      from the table. Accordingly, management stations
                      must be prepared to receive tabular information
                      from agents that corresponds to entries not
                      currently in use. Proper interpretation of such
                      entries requires examination of the relevant
                      ipRouteType attribute.!!;
