Internet-Draft        EIDR URN Namespace Definition        February 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for EIDR Identifiers.

   EIDR Identifiers are centrally registered, globally unique
   identifiers for audiovisual works and their variants, primarily film
   and television.  A unique set of metadata parameters describing the
   associated work is bound to the EIDR Identifier at time of
   registration -- see [EIDR-OVERVIEW] and [EIDR-INTRO] for background
   information.

2.  URN Namespace Definition Template

   The following template is provided in accordance with [RFC3406].

   Namespace ID:

      EIDR

   Registration Information:

      Version 1

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The URN representation of an EIDR Identifier conforms to the
      following syntax (expressed using [RFC2234]):

           URN-EIDR = "URN:EIDR:" EIDR-NSS
           EIDR-NSS = DOI-PREFIX ":" DOI-SUFFIX

      where DOI-PREFIX and DOI-SUFFIX are DOI Name prefix and suffix,
      respectively, translated into canonical NSS format according to
      [RFC2141].  DOI Name syntax is specified in [ISO26234].

      NOTE: The canonical string representation of an EIDR Identifier
      uses "/" instead of ":" as the delimiter between DOI-PREFIX and
      DOI-SUFFIX. ":" is used here since "/" is a reserved character.

      When DOI-PREFIX is equal to "10.5240", the syntax of DOI-SUFFIX is
      further constrained according to [SMPTERP2079] as follows:

           DOI-SUFFIX   = EIDR-SUFFIX
           EIDR-SUFFIX  = 5*5(4*4HEXDIG "-") CHECK
           DIGIT        = %x30-39
           HEXDIG       = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
           ALPHA        = %x41-5A / %x61-7A
           CHECK        = DIGIT / ALPHA

      where CHECK is the Mod 37,36 check character as specified in
      [ISO7064], computed over the 20 hexadecimal digits HEXDIG of EIDR-
      SUFFIX.

      EXAMPLE: URN:EIDR:10.5240:68DD-341E-03EE-4BB8-1761-Q

      NOTE: Other values DOI-PREFIX might be used for EIDR Identifiers
      in the future.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      [ISO26234] specifies DOI Name syntax and registration.

      [SMPTERP2079] specifies a specific kind of EIDR Identifier.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      An EIDR Identifier is a DOI Name.  As such, the uniqueness of the
      combination of DOI-PREFIX and DOI-SUFFIX, and thus EIDR-NSS, is
      guaranteed by the ISO 26324 Registration Authority.  A DOI Name is
      never reassigned.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      As a DOI Name, the persistence of EIDR-NSS is guaranteed by the
      ISO 26324 Registration Authority.  A DOI Name remains valid
      indefinitely.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      EIDR-NSS values are assigned by the EIDR organization, which
      registers the underlying DOI Name with the ISO 26324 Registration
      Authority.

      Entities involved in the motion picture and television industry,
      either directly in the production of content or in its
      distribution and related services, are eligible to apply for
      registrant status.  Registrants pay an annual membership fee that
      depends on the size of the company.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      As a DOI Name, the resolution of EIDR-NSS is handled by the ISO
      26324 Registration Authority.

      The ISO 26324 Registration Authority operates a web service that
      allows an EIDR-NSS to be resolved by issuing an HTTP GET request
      to the following URI:

               "http://doi.org/" DOI-PREFIX "/" DOI-SUFFIX

      EXAMPLE: http://doi.org/10.5240/68DD-341E-03EE-4BB8-1761-Q

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      Two EIDR-NSS are equivalent if and only if they are equal.  EIDR-
      NSS are case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      As specified above, each component of NSS-EIDR, namely DOI-PREFIX
      and DOI-SUFFIX, is translated to conform to the URN syntax.

   Validation mechanism:

      The validity of an EIDR-NSS can only be guaranteed by completing
      the resolution process.

      For EIDR-NSS with an DOI-PREFIX equal to "10.5240", the CHECK
      value can be used for integrity checking, as specified above.

   Scope:

      EIDR Identifiers are centrally registered, globally unique
      identifiers for use with audiovisual works worldwide.

3.  Namespace Considerations

   EIDR Identifiers are intended for use in Internet applications, where
   URNs are routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.  There is
   no direct mapping from EIDR Identifiers to existing URN namepsaces.

4.  Community Considerations

   The primary registrants of EIDR Identifiers are producers and
   distributors of audiovisual works, metadata aggregators, and
   audiovisual archives.  Any bona fide member of the ecosystem can
   become an EIDR member and register any work.  EIDR identifiers can be
   used by anyone to unambiguously identify an audiovisual asset and
   retrieve underlying metadata.  The primary benefits of its use are
   associated with works in wide distribution, management of long or
   complex distribution chains, and aggregation of information from
   multiple sources.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration that is to be entered
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.  It specifically requests the
   "EIDR" NID.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document only specifies the syntax of the EIDR-URN namespace,
   and is therefore security-neutral.  The details assignment and
   resolution processes are defined external to this document by the
   EIDR organization and the ISO 26324 Registration Authority, and thus
   outside the scope of this document.
