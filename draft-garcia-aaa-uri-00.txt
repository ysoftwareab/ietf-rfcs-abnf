Internet-Draft                  AAA URI                    February 2004


1. Introduction

   RFC 3588 [11] describes the Diameter base protocol for
   authentication, authorization and accounting purposes. The RFC
   provides for the existence of a DiameterURI AVP that contains a AAA
   or AAAS URI. RFC 3588 [11] does not provide, though, instructions to
   IANA to register either of those URI schemes in the Official IANA
   Registry of URI schemes (available at http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/uri-schemes/).

   This memo defines the syntax of the AAA and AAAS URI for the purpose
   of the registration of both URIs in the Official IANA Registry of URI
   schemes. The syntax of both URIs defined in this document is
   compatible with that initially defined in RFC 3588.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. The AAA and AAAS URIs

   This section defines the syntax of the AAA and AAAS URI schemes in
   augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC 2234 [2]. The syntax
   in this section adopts the definitions of "absoluteURI", "host" and
   "port" from RFC 2396 [3] and their corresponding updates specified in
   RFC 2732 [4].

   Both the AAA and the AAAS URI schemes are used to identify resources
   related to authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)
   functions that are accessed with AAA protocols such as RADIUS [9] or
   Diameter [11].

   The AAA URI scheme indicates that transport layer security is not
   required or used. The AAAS URI scheme indicates the requirement to
   the AAA protocol to use a transport protocol that provides security
   functions, such as TLS [8].

   There URIs use he USASCII character encoding scheme.

   The AAA and AAA URI schemes have the following ABNF:

       AAA-URI   = "aaa://" host [":" port] [ transport ] [ protocol ]

       AAAS-URI  = "aaas://" host [":" port] [ transport ] [ protocol ]

Internet-Draft                  AAA URI                    February 2004


   The semantics and syntax of "host" and "port" are defined in RFC 2396
   [3] and updated in RFC 2732 [4]. If "host" includes a "hostname" (as
   opposed to an "IPv4address" or an "IPv6address") then it MUST be a
   Fully Qualified Domain Name. If the port is empty or not given, the
   default port allocated to Diameter (3868) is assumed.
      OPEN ISSUE: Note that the initial definition of the AAA/AAAS URIs
      in RFC 3588 mandate an FQDN. Now we have included "host", that can
      be either a hostname, IPv4address or IPv6address (see RFC 2396 and
      RFC 2732 for details). Doest the inclusion of IP addresses
      represent a problem?

         transport          = ";transport=" transport-protocol

         transport-protocol = ( "tcp" / "sctp" / "udp" )

      OPEN ISSUE: As TLS over TCP and TLS over SCTP are transpor
      protocols, should we add them to the list of transport protocols
      above?

   TCP refers to the Transmission Control Protocol specified in RFC 793
   [6]. SCTP refers to the Stream Control Transport Protocol specified
   in RFC 2960 [10]. UDP refers to the User Datagram Protocol specified
   in RFC 768 [5]. TLS refers to the Transport Layer Security over TCP
   specified in RFC 2246 [8]. If the transport parameter is empty or not
   given, the default transport protocol, SCTP, is assumed

         protocol           = ";protocol=" aaa-protocol

         aaa-protocol       = ( "diameter" / "radius" / "tacacs+" )

   The token "diameter" refers to the Diameter base protocol specified
   in RFC 3588 [11]. The token "radius" refers to the RADIUS protocol
   specified in RADIUS [9]. The token "tacacs+" refers to the TACACS
   protocol defined in RFC 1492 [7]. If the protocol parameter is not
   given or empty, the default AAA protocol, Diameter, is assumed.

   Diameter does not provide support for UDP as a transport protocol,
   therefore, UDP MUST NOT be used when Diameter is the AAA protocol.

4. Examples

   The following are examples of valid AAA and AAAS URIs:

         aaa://host.example.com;transport=tcp
         aaas://host.example.com;transport=tls;protocol=diameter
         aaa://host.example.com;protocol=diameter
         aaa://host.example.com:6666;protocol=diameter
         aaa://host.example.com:6666;transport=tcp;protocol=diameter

5. IANA Considerations

   This memo instructs IANA the following actions:
   o  To include "aaa" and "aaas" in the Official IANA Registry of URI
      Schemes, http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes
   o  To create a new "transport" sub-registry under http://
      www.iana.org/assignments/aaa-parameters, whose values are as per
      Section Section 3.
   o  To create a mew "protocol" sub-registry under http://www.iana.org/
      assignments/aaa-parameters, whose values are as defined Section
      Section 3.

   Contact information: IETF AAA Working group. In case the WG does no
   exist anymore, any person appointed by the IETF Operations and
   Management Area Director.

   Registered-by: Miguel Garcia, miguel.an.garcia@nokia.com

   Change control:
      OPEN ISSUE: Need to define the procedure to add new parameters or
      tokens to existing parameters to those URIs. Is an expert review
      needed?

6. Security Considerations

   This memo does not specify a protocol, but the syntax of the AAA and
   AAAS URI. The AAAS URI is used to indicate that a secured transport
   layer is required, such as TLS [8]. These URIs are transport
   independent, therefore, each particular protocol defines its own
   security considerations.

7. Acknowledgements

   The auhor would to thank Eero Pasinen and John Loughney for providing
   an initial set of comments.
