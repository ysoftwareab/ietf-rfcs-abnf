2.  Abstract

This memo defines a directory information profile for a white pages per-
son,  to  be  carried in an application/directory MIME Content-Type. The
profile consists of type definitions (e.g., for name and email  address)
and the corresponding format of values that each type is allowed to con-
tain.

3.  Overview

The application/directory MIME Content-Type  defined  in  [MIME-DIR]  is
used  for representing directory information in MIME format.  It defines
a general framework for carrying "type: value" style information in  the
body  of  a  MIME message, but does not define specific types or values.
This document defines a profile containing the types  and  corresponding
value  formats for representing information about an electronic business
card.  The profile reflects the Versit Electronic Business Card  (vCard)
schema defined in [VERSIT-VCARD].

3.1.  The vCard Profile

The profile is defined as follows, using the profile  registration  tem-
plate from Section 8 of [MIME-DIR].

3.2.  vCard Profile Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME profile vcard

   Profile name: vcard

   Profile purpose: To hold vcard information about an electronic  busi-
   ness card.

   Profile types: BEGIN, END, FN, N, PHOTO, BDAY, ADR, FADR, TEL, EMAIL,
   MAILER,  TZ,  GEO,  TITLE,  ROLE, LOGO, AGENT, ORG, NOTE, REV, SOUND,
   URL, UID, KEY

   Profile special notes: The content entity must begin  with  the  type
   BEGIN  and end with the type END.  There is no other ordering limita-
   tions on types within the content entity.

   The default transfer encoding for the vCard profile is 7-Bit.  Multi-
   ple line type values are not allowed for 7-Bit encoding.  The default
   transfer encoding can be overridden for an individual type  value  by
   using  the  "ENCODING"  type  parameter.   The parameter value can be
   reset to either "BASE64" or "QUOTED-PRINTABLE".  This type  parameter
   may be used on any profile type.

   The default character set is ASCII.  The default character set can be
   overridden  for  an individual type value by using the "CHARSET" type
   parameter.  This type parameter may be  used  on  any  profile  type.
   However, the use of this parameter on some profile types may not make
   sense.

   The default language is "en-US" (US English).  The  default  language
   can  be  overridden  for  an  individual  type  value  by  using  the
   "LANGUAGE" type parameter.  This type parameter may be  used  on  any
   profile  type.   However,  the  use of this parameter on some profile
   types may not make sense.

   The default location of the type values is inline  with  the  profile
   type.   However,  for  some profile types, such as those that specify
   multimedia values, it is efficient to organize the type  value  as  a
   separate MIME entity.  The type parameter "VALUE" can be specified to
   override the "INLINE" location of the type value.  The type value can
   be  specified  as  being  located  in a separate MIME entity with the

   "CID" value.  In this case, the type value is the Content- ID for the
   MIME  entity  containing the type value.  In addition, the type value
   can be specified as being located out  on  the  network  within  some
   Internet resource with the "URL" value.  In this case, the type value
   is the Uniform Resource Locator for the Internet resource  containing
   the type value.  This type parameter may be used on any profile type.
   However, the use of this parameter on some profile types may not make
   sense.

   This profile supports the type grouping mechanism defined  in  [MIME-
   DIR].   Grouping  of  related  profile types is a useful technique to
   communicate common semantics concerning the  properties  of  a  vCard
   object.

   Intended usage: COMMON

The associated type definitions follow, using the type registration tem-
plate from Section 9 of [MIME-DIR].

3.3.  Delimiter Profile Types

The following profile types are used to delimit the  vCard  data  within
the  content type.  These types are useful to completely define the con-
tent type so that it might be identified as a vCard object when the con-
tent type is in a persistent form outside of a MIME message.

3.3.1.  BEGIN Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type BEGIN

   Type name: BEGIN

   Type purpose: To delimit the beginning of the vCard content data.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The only valid value is "vCard".

   Type example:                 BEGIN: vCard

3.3.2.  END Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type END

   Type name: END

   Type purpose: To delimit the end of the vCard content data.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type either has no value  or  has  the  value
   "vCard".

   Type example:
                   END: vCard

3.4.  Identification Profile Types

These profile types are concerned with information associated  with  the
identification  and naming of the individual or resource associated with
the vCard object.

3.4.1.  FN Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type FN

   Type name:FN

   Type purpose: To specify the formatted name  string  associated  with
   the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The value is intended to be used as  a  formatted
   string  corresponding  to  how the name of the individual or resource
   associated with the vCard is to be displayed.  This type is based  on
   the  semantics  of  the  X.520  Common  Name attribute.  The type may
   specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a character  set  for
   the  type  value,  and  LANGUAGE,  to specify a language for the type
   value.  These are further defined in [MIME- DIR].

   Type example:
                   FN: Mr. John Q. Public, Esq.

3.4.2.  N Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type N

   Type name: N

   Type purpose: To specify the structured name strings associated  with

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special note: The type value is a structured string  correspond-
   ing,  in  sequence, to the Family Name, Given Name, Additional Names,
   Honorific Prefixes, and Suffixes corresponding to the  individual  or
   resource associated with the vCard.  The component strings are delim-
   ited by SEMI-COLON characters and possibly one or  more  LWSP.   This
   type  is  based  on the semantics of the X.520 individual name attri-
   butes.  The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to  specify
   a  character  set  for  the  type  value,  and LANGUAGE, to specify a
   language for the type value.  These are  further  defined  in  [MIME-
   DIR].

   Type example:
                   N: Public;John;Quinlan;Mr.;Esq.

3.4.3.  PHOTO Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type PHOTO

   Type name: PHOTO

   Type purpose: To specify an  image  or  photograph  information  that
   annotates  some  aspect of the vCard object.  By default this type is
   used to specify a photograph or image of the individual  or  resource
   associated with the vCard.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify  the  format of the graphic image.  The TYPE parameter values
   may include "GIF" to indicate the GIF format and "JPEG"  to  indicate
   the  JPEG  format.   The  type  may  also  include the type parameter
   "ENCODING" to specify the content encoding  applied  to  the  graphic
   image.  The ENCODING parameter value may include "BASE64" to indicate
   the Base64 encoding or  "QUOTED-PRINTABLE"  to  indicate  the  quoted
   printable  encoding.   The  type  may also include the type parameter
   "VALUE" to specify the location of the type value.  The VALUE parame-
   ter  values  may  include "INLINE" to indicate that the graphic image
   value is included within the content type value,  "URL"  to  indicate
   the  uniform  resource  locator for where the content for the graphic
   image can be  found  in  the  network,  and  "CID"  to  indicate  the
   content-id  for the MIME entity that encapsulates the content for the
   graphic image.

   Type example:
                   PHOTO;TYPE=GIF;ENCODE=QUOTED-PRINTABLE;VALUE=URL: =

   8601 calendar date, complete representation.

   Type example:
                   BDAY: 1996-04-15

3.5.  Delivery Addressing Profile Types

These profile types are concerned with information associated  with  the
delivery addressing or label for the vCard object.

3.5.1.  ADR Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type ADR

   Type name: ADR

   Type purpose: To specify the structured delivery address  strings  of
   the individual or resource associated with the vCard.

   Type encoding: text

   Type special notes: The type  value  is  a  string  consisting  of  a
   sequence  of  address  components  (i.e.,  extended  address,  street
   address, locality, region, postal code, and country  name)  separated
   by SEMI-COLON and optionally one or more LWSP.

   The usual line-folding technique described in [MIME-DIR] can be  used
   to  represent  multi-line  addresses.  For example, a line break in a
   value should be encoded using  either  Base64  or  Quoted-  Printable
   methods.

   The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to further qualify the

   "WORK" to indicate delivery address for a place of work,  and  "PREF"
   for  the  preferred delivery address when more than one address might
   be specified.  These type parameter values  may  be  specified  as  a
   parameter  list  (i.e.,  "TYPE=DOM,  TYPE=POSTAL") or as a value list
   (i.e., "TYPE=DOM, POSTAL").  This type is based on semantics  of  the
   X.520  geographical  and  postal addressing attributes.  The type may
   also specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a character  set
   for  the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language for the type
   value.  These are further defined in [MIME- DIR].

   Type example:
                   ADR;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE;TYPE=DOM,HOME,=
                   POSTAL,PARCEL: 123 Main Street;Any Town; CA;91921-1234

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type TZ

   Type name: TZ

   Type purpose: To specify information related to the time zone of  the
   vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: the type value is specified as a string as speci-
   fied  in  a  manner consistent with [ISO 8601].  It is an offset from
   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  An ISO 8601 UTC offset,  in  basic
   format, is specified as a positive or negative difference in units of
   hours and minutes (e.g., +hhmm).  If minutes are zero, then they  may
   be omitted and the format would be specified in units of hours (e.g.,
   +hh).  The time is specified as a 24-hour clock. Hour values are from
   00  to  24, and minute values are from 00 to 59. Hour and minutes are
   2-digits with high order zeroes required  to  maintain  digit  count.
   The  extended format for ISO 8601 makes use of a colon character as a
   separator of the hour and minute substrings.

   Type special notes: This type is based on the X.520 Business Category
   explanatory  attribute.   This  property  is included as an organiza-
   tional type to avoid confusion with the semantics of the  TITLE  type
   and  incorrect  usage of that type when the semantics of this type is
   intended.

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a  char-
   acter set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language for

   Type name: LOGO

   Type purpose: To specify a graphic image of the logo of the organiza-
   tion  that  is  associated  with the individual or resource the vCard
   belongs to.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify  the  format of the graphic image.  The TYPE parameter values
   may include "GIF" to indicate the GIF format and "JPEG"  to  indicate
   the  JPEG  format.   The  type  may  also  include the type parameter

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type AGENT

   Type name: AGENT

   Type purpose: To specify information about another  person  who  will
   act  on behalf of the individual or resource associate with the vCard
   object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: This type typically is used to  specify  an  area
   administrator,  assistant, or secretary for the individual associated
   with the vCard object.  A key characteristic of  the  Agent  type  is
   that  it represents somebody or something that is separately address-
   able.  The value for this type is the content message  identifier  or
   Uniform Resource Locator associated with the vCard defining the Agent
   individual or resource.

   The type may include the type parameter "VALUE" to specify the  loca-
   tion of the type value.  The VALUE parameter values may include "CID"
   to indicate the value specifies the content identifier for  the  MIME
   entity  containing the value or "URL" to indicate the value specifies
   the uniform resource locator for the value.  The type  parameter  may
   also include "INLINE"; however, this is not a recommended practice as
   MIME user agents will not be expected to be  able  to  process  vCard
   objects  nested in this manner.  Nested vCard object will be expected
   to be mailed within a single message as multiple MIME entities.   The
   INLINE nesting of vCard object may have some limited utility in where
   a monolithic data stream is required.

   Type example:
           AGENT;VALUE=CID: <JQPUBLIC.part3.960129T083020.xyzMail@host3.com>

3.8.5.  ORG Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type ORG

   Type name: ORG

   Type purpose: To specify the organizational name and units associated
   with the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type is based on the X.520 Organization  Name
   and  Organization  Unit  attributes.   The type value is a structured
   string  consisting  of  the  organization  name,  followed   by   any

   organizational  units.  The string components are separated the SEMI-
   COLON character.

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a  char-
   acter set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language for
   the type value.  These are further defined in [MIME- DIR].

   Type example:
                   ORG: ABC, Inc.;North American Division;Marketing

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type value is a calendar date and time of day
   in  a form conforming to ISO 8601 complete representation.  The value
   distinguishes the current revision of the information  defining  this
   vCard object.

   Type example:
                   REV: 19951031T222710Z

3.9.3.  SOUND Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type SOUND

   Type name: SOUND

   Type purpose: To specify a digital  sound  content  information  that
   annotates  some  aspect of the vCard object.  By default this type is
   used to specify the proper pronunciation of the name  type  value  of
   the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify  the  format of the digital sound.  The TYPE parameter values
   may include "PCM" to indicate the MIME basic audio content  type  and
   "WAVE"  to  indicate  the Wave format.  The type may also include the
   type parameter "ENCODING" to specify the content encoding applied  to
   the digital sound.  The ENCODING parameter value may include "BASE64"
   to indicate the Base64 encoding.  The type may also include the  type
   parameter  "VALUE"  to  specify  the location of the type value.  The
   VALUE parameter values may include  "INLINE"  to  indicate  that  the
   digital  sound  is  included  within the content type value, "URL" to
   indicate the uniform resource locator for where the content  for  the
   digital  sound can be found in the network, and "CID" to indicate the
   content-id for the MIME entity that encapsulates the content for  the
   digital sound.

   Type example:
                   SOUND;TYPE=PCM;ENCODE=QUOTED-PRINTABLE;VALUE=CID: =
                   <JOHNQPUBLIC.part8.19960229T080000.xyzMail@host1.com>

3.9.4.  URL Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu

Expires November 1996                                     INTERNET DRAFT


   Type name: URL

   Type purpose: To specify an Internet location that  can  be  used  to
   obtain real-time or more complete information about the individual or
   resource associate with the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: An application of this type might be  to  specify
   the  location of a publicly accessible directory, such as an Internet
   whitepages, where up-todate information can be found about the  indi-
   vidual specified by a vCard.

   Type example:
           URL: http://www.swbyps.restaurant.french/~chezchic.html

3.9.5.  UID Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type UID

   Type name: UID

   Type purpose: To specify a value that represents  a  globally  unique
   identifier  corresponding  to  the  individual or resource associated
   with the vCard object.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type value can be  used  as  a  mechanism  to
   relate  different  vCard  objects.   Some  examples of valid forms of
   unique identifiers would include ISO 9070 formal  public  identifiers
   (FPI)  as  defined in [ISO 9070], X.500 distinguished names, machine-
   generated random numbers with  a  statistically  high  likelihood  of
   being  globally  unique,  and Uniform Resource Locators (URL).  If an
   URL is specified, it is suggested that the URL  reference  a  service
   which  will  produce  an updated version of the vCard associated with
   the individual or resource.

   The type may include the type parameter "TYPE" to specify the  format
   of  the  unique  identifier.   The  TYPE parameter values may include
   "ISO9070" to indicate the ISO 9070 FPI  type  of  unique  identifier,
   "X500" to indicate the X.500 DSN type of unique identifier, "MACH" to
   indicate a machine generated random number type of unique identifier,
   and "URL" to indicate a Uniform Resource Locator type of unique iden-
   tifier.

   Type example:

These profile types are concerned with  the  security  of  communication
pathways or access to the vCard object.

3.10.1.  KEY Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-direct@umich.edu
   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type KEY

   Type name: KEY

   Type purpose: To specify a public key that conforms to a  bilaterally
   agreed to representation.

   Type encoding: text.

   Type special notes: The type may include the type  parameter  "ENCOD-
   ING"  to specify the content encoding applied to the public key.  The
   ENCODING parameter value may include "BASE64" to indicate the  Base64
   encoding  or  "QUOTED-PRINTABLE"  to  indicate  the quoted- printable
   encoding.  The type may also include the  type  parameter  "TYPE"  to
   specify  the  type  of  the public key.  The TYPE parameter value may
   include "X509" to indicate a X.509 public key certificate or "PGP" to
   indicate an PGP public key.

3.11.  Extended Profile Types

The profile types defined by this document can be extended with  private
types  using the private type mechanism defined in [MIME]. Private types
with a name starting with "X-" may be defined  bilaterally  between  two
cooperating agents without outside registration or standardization.

4.  Formal Grammar

The following grammar defines the content entity specified by this  pro-
file.

This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC  822,  but
it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:

     CR          =  <ASCII CR, carriage return>  ; (     15,      13.)
     LF          =  <ASCII LF, linefeed>         ; (     12,      10.)
     CRLF       =  CR LF
     SPACE       =  <ASCII SP, space>            ; (     40,      32.)
     HTAB        =  <ASCII HT, horizontal-tab>   ; (     11,       9.)
