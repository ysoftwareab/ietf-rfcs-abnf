1.  Details

   The Network Information Center (NIC) does not provide domain
   registration services anymore for the Defense Data Network (DDN) or
   the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), nor is the
   administrator of the root domain name servers or of the "ARPA,"
   "COM," "EDU," "ORG," "GOV," and "MIL" top level domains.  The entity
   SRI-NIC no longer exists, and many of these functions have been taken
   over by ICANN, ccTLDs and gTLDs.  The vague DNS concepts (zone,
   domain server...) defined in RFC 1032 are best left to the
   authoritative sources.  The description of the Nicname/Whois service
   made there has been obsoleted by RFC 3912.  In the light of this all,
   this document requests to move the RFC 1032 from status UNKNOWN to
   status HISTORIC.

2.  Security Considerations

   Moving RFC 1032 to HISTORIC has no known effect on the security of
   the internet.
