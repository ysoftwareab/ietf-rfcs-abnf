          Framework for Network Resource Property Description
                     draft-jilongwang-opsawg-csp-00

Abstract

   This memo discusses and defines a framework for cyberspace resource
   property description, which is suitable for the unified
   classification organization and description of multi-source network
   resource measurement information.  Now, there is no unified
   description framework for network resource property.  The objective
   of this draft is to establish a general model based on cyberspace
   identification reference, and implement the reuse of survey data in
   different users and occasions.  Then discuss the basic methodology
   and propose a less mature framework for further complement and
   improvement

1.  Introduction

   Network space measurement is based on certain methods, techniques and
   standards.  It uses software or hardware tools to test the
   composition, behavior and development of cyberspace by testing
   multiple indicators that characterize the state, property and
   relationships of various layers of cyberspace.  The range of
   measurement can be local to the network space or global.  The objects
   to be measured include the composition, structure, property,
   behavior, characteristics, laws and trends of the network space.  The
   information obtained by measurement is a kind of typical big data.
   The content is diverse in format, complex in structure and rapid in
   change.  It is difficult to understand, interact with, and
   disseminate the information.

   Given that network measurement data may be used by many people other
   than producers.  It is usually produced by an individual or
   organization and used by others or organizations.  Building a unified
   entity encoding rule enables people or organizations that are less
   familiar with each other to better share data and use the data
   appropriately.  As web measurement data producers and users process
   more and more data, appropriate textual data can provide them with
   rich information about the data, enabling them to better manage,
   store, share, update and reuse data products.

Internet-Draft    Network Resource Property Description   September 2019


   This memo can support the integration and management of surveying and
   mapping information across departments, cross-domains, time space,
   multi-source and multi-scale networks through the unified description
   of network space property.  It can be used as cyberspace management
   in the future.  It adopts a markup language RDF for describing
   network resource property, and focuses on the classification and
   coding rules of network measurement elements and their expansion
   methods.

2.  Terminology and Definition

2.1.  Terminology and Definition

   In this memo, individuals represent the objects of interest in the
   field of network mapping space, and OWL does not use the Unique Name
   Assumption.  It must clearly indicate whether individuals are
   identical, otherwise their relationship is unclear.

   Note: Individuals are sometimes referred to as Instances.

2.2.  Property

   Properties are binary relationships between individuals.  In the
   description logic, the concept of a Role is represented.  Properties
   can be divided into the following categories:

   Functional property

   Functional property can only be connected to one individual.

   Inverse Functional Property

   The inverse functional property is that for a given individual, only
   at most one individual can be connected through this property.  That
   is, the inverse property of this property is a functional property.

   Inverse Property

   The inverse property uses only one property name as a parameter,
   indicating the inversion of the relationship.

   Transitive Property

   Transitive property means that the property can be passed.

   Object Property

Internet-Draft    Network Resource Property Description   September 2019


   The Object property represents the relationship between instances of
   two classes.

   Datatype Property

   Connect individual and XML Schema data type values or RDF literals,
   Datatype property cannot be passed, symmetric, or inverse functional.

2.3.  Cyberspace Feature

   Cyberspace is a virtual and real space where human beings use
   information facilities to construct and realize the information
   interaction, and then influence human thoughts and behaviors.  It
   relies on the carrier of information and communication technology
   infrastructure carriers such as Internet, telecommunication networks,
   and various control systems and devices.

   In cyberspace, the use of cyberspace means to detect and perceive
   entities, including the Internet, telecommunications networks,
   industrial control networks and other types of network resources.
   Specifically, cyberspace resources include physical equipment such as
   network infrastructure and network access; information resources and
   network services such as audio, video, websites and text data;
   virtual characters, various IP-based telecommunication network
   equipment and industrial control systems, etc.

   The feature is an abstract representation of an entity.  Note:
   Features can appear as types or as instances.  When expressing only
   one meaning, you should use a feature type or a feature instance.A
   single cyberspace resource object existing in cyberspace is a
   specific unit of cyberspace resource feature, and it is also the
   smallest component of the corresponding feature types, and can be
   represented by specific symbols.

4.  Use cases

   The following sections highlight some of the most common framework
   for network resource property description use case scenarios and are
   in no way exhaustive.

4.1.  Intelligent semantic search

   The traditional search method mainly uses keyword matching to realize
   the retrieval of information.  Therefore, it is difficult for the
   user to simply use the keyword or keyword string to retrieve the
   content that he really needs, and the natural language changes with
   time, region or field.  The same concept can be expressed in
   different language expressions.  For the same concept retrieval,
   different users may use different keywords to query, resulting in a
   large amount of irrelevant information being returned to the user.

   Intelligent semantic search based on framework for network resource
   property description is an advanced form of information retrieval,
   which can provide users with search results in an accurate and
   concise natural language.  When the user initiates the query, the
   search engine will provides unique identities for each resource, map
   to parse and reason the keywords of the user query, and then map it
   to one or a set of concepts, and then according to the concept level
   in the framework.

4.2.  Network security situational awareness

   There are many elements involved in cyber security.  These elements
   often play a role in the attack threat.  According to the order of
   context, the layers are progressive, and finally reflect the macro
   network security situation.  The purpose of each element is
   different, and the network security situation process can be divided
   into several situational segments.  Various situational elements are
   extracted through network security events.

   Network security situational awareness based on framework for network
   resource property description can be regarded as a specific
   situational segment.  Through the structure of the security
   situational, the role of various situational elements is
   hierarchically displayed, enabling managers to grasp the current
   network security more deeply and accurately.

Internet-Draft    Network Resource Property Description   September 2019


4.3.  Network Security

   Network viruses and worms themselves are also a kind of network
   resources.  With the deepening of network opening and complexity,
   network viruses and worms are evolving constantly, and the
   characteristics of diversity and spatial discretization are
   increasing, resulting in a great hidden danger of network security.

   The framework for network resources categorization can locate the
   network resources more accurately and distinguish the benign or
   malignant network resources, study the process of virus evolution and
   the possible effects according to the attached attributes , and
   provide a clearer way to safeguard the operation of network space
   security, such as anti virus, antivirus and so on.

5.  Methodology for Network Resources Attribute Description

5.1.  Basic Principles

5.1.1.  Scientific principle

   The attribute description should conform to the basic organizational
   rules of cyberspace resource mapping information.  The selection of
   attribute classification perspective should meet the integration
   requirements of multi-source cyberspace resource mapping information,
   and fully take into account the traditional information
   classification system in various fields, thus covering network
   mapping information at various levels and fields.

5.1.2.  Systematic principle

   The methodology of Attribute description should be designed with good
   compatibility and can cover the requirements of the attribute
   representation of network measuring and mapping feature of different
   scales, different properties and different types.  The attribute
   categorization system should correctly reflect the measuring and
   mapping feature and the vertical and horizontal architecture
   attributes.  The level of information categorization and grading
   should be clear and reasonable.  The same perspective should be
   adopted for the categorization of objects at the same level.

5.1.3.  Consistency principle

   The design of attribute categorization and description should meet
   the uniqueness of the measuring and mapping feature attributes of
   cyberspace resources in the same mapping system, in which the values
   and units of the physical domain, logical domain and cognitive domain
   attributes of entities should be consistent with the national and

Internet-Draft    Network Resource Property Description   September 2019


   international standards in related fields.  When the scale of
   resources and attributes in cyberspace is modified and redirected,
   the description of resource attributes and the relationship between
   resources and attributes should be stable and semantically
   consistent.

5.1.4.  Scalability principle

   The attribute description, meta property description, resource-
   attribute relationship description and attribute-attribute
   relationship description of cyberspace resources are able to perfect
   and expand when facing the future development of cyberspace, multi-
   domain information integration and sharing, mapping of unknown
   resources and user requirements in different fields.

5.2.  Attribute description framework

   In this memo, the attributes of cyberspace resources are described by
   RDF resource description framework, and metadata is described as a
   data model through XML syntax and RDFS.  The basic RDF specification
   only defines the rules, and does not define the vocabularies for
   describing resources.  It should be refined for practical application
   in different fields.

   RDF uses Web identifiers (URI) to identify things, and attributes and
   attribute values to describe resources, allowing RDF to represent one
   or more simple statements about resources as a graph of nodes and
   arcs, where nodes represent resource and attribute values and arcs
   represent attributes.

   The RDF description for the cyberspace resource attribute consists of
   a file, resource description, and statement three-level structure,
   which is serialized by RDF/XML syntax.  A file can contain multiple
   resource descriptions, and a resource description can contain
   multiple statements, a statement can be expressed as a triplet
   composed of {subject, predicate, object} in natural language.  In the
   cyberspace resource and the attribute description, the cyberspace
   resource entity is corresponding to the subject in the triplet, the
   cyberspace attribute type is corresponding to the predicate in the
   triplet, and the attribute value is corresponding to the object in
   the triplet, which constitute the{cyberspace resource entity,
   cyberspace attribute type, attribute value} triplet can accurately
   and unambiguously record and describe all the information obtained
   during the measuring and mapping process.

5.3.  Description of association rules for attributes description

   The association rules of attributes represent the internal relations
   between attributes, and the possible associations or relations
   between things can be found behind the data.  Unsupervised machine
   learning methods commonly found in data mining can be used for
   knowledge discovery and building knowledge maps.  In this memo,
   various attribute association operations are defined: alias
   relationship, synonym relationship, ownership relationship, and
   aggregation relationship.

6.  Framework for Network Resources Attribute Description

   According to the state, structure and behavior characteristics of
   resources at different levels in cyberspace, this memo divides the
   properties of resources in cyberspace into four categories, namely
   physical domain, logical domain, cognitive domain and social domain,
   which are respectively used to describe the explicit and partial
   implicit characteristics of resources at corresponding levels.  In
   addition to representing the properties of cyberspace resources, the
   memo also includes nine meta property, which represent the common
   features of attributes.  The attribute description specifies its
   meaning, data type, range of values, and so on as much as possible.

6.1.  Physical domain attributes

   The physical domain attribute represents a subset of features that
   can be observed, queried, recorded, and measured in the physical
   space and geospatial of each resource feature constituting the
   cyberspace.  Each attribute value is closely related to the objective
   existence of the corresponding resource feature in the physical
   world.  Resources are at a higher level, the material basis of
   services.  According to the attribute, the focus of the resource
   entity is reflected, and further subdivided into basic attributes,
   electrical attributes and security attributes..

6.1.1.  Basic attributes of the entity

   The basic attributes of the entity cover the general characteristics
   of the naming, identification, location, attribution, appearance,
