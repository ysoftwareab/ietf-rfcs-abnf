            ALTO Extension: Endpoint Cost Service for Flows
                      draft-wang-alto-ecs-flows-00

Abstract

   The Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) has limitations to illustrate the
   network condition and to work with the OpenFlow protocol.  This
   document extends ECS to improve the Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO) protocol by defining more types of endpoint
   address such as port number, protocol type, domain and etc.

1.  Introduction

   ECS is a basic service of the ALTO services defined in [RFC7285].
   Based on the simple host model when defining endpoints, ECS defined
   in [RFC7285] may not work well in an emerging settings such as
   Software Defined Networking (SDN) based settings, where network
   routing decisions can be flow based.  In this document, we present an
   extended ECS for such new settings.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terms defined as follows:

   o  {1.2.3}: References of this form are to sections in the ALTO
      protocol specification [RFC7285].

   o  And other terms defined in {8.2} of [RFC7285].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Motivations

   Below is the acceptable input parameters of ECS in {11.5.1.3} of
   [RFC7285].

                  object {
                    CostType          cost-type;
                    [JSONString       constraints<0..*>;]
                    EndpointFilter    endpoints;
                  } ReqEndpointCostMap;

                  object {
                    [TypedEndpointAddr srcs<0..*>;]
                    [TypedEndpointAddr dsts<0..*>;]
                  } EndpointFilter;

   Hence, the granularity is TypedEndpointAddr, which is defined in
   {10.4.1} of [RFC7285].  In particular, [RFC7285] defines two address
   types: ipv4 and ipv6.  This, however, may limit the usage of ECS in
   multiple settings.  Below we give some use cases.

   Use case 1:

   ECS is not compatible with virtual host technology, a popular on the
   Internet, which allows different hosts to share the same IP address.
   For example, a reverse proxy p1 hosts three sites shown in Figure 1.
   These sites share the same public network address: 202.180.1.11.
   Suppose the link in the private network from p1 to server s1 is busy,
   but the link to server s2 is free.  It will cost client c1 more to
   access www.a.com than www.b.com.  Suppose c1 wants to know the cost
   to www.a.com.  Because ECS only supports IP addresses, it will query
   the DNS server to transfer the domain name to IP address.  Therefore,
   c1 can only obtain the cost to p1.

   As a result, c1 will get the same result to three different domain
   names because ECS is only capable of measuring the cost between IP
   addresses.

          Figure 1: Using reverse proxy to operate virtual hosts.

   Use case 2:

   ECS is not compatible with port-based or protocol-based routing
   systems.  For example, the OpenFlow protocol can forward packets to
   different destinations by the port in TCP/IP protocols.  A simple
   topology is shown in Figure 2, the link between switch sw1 and switch
   sw2 has a low speed but a low latency, while sw3 is a high speed but
   high latency switch.  And there are two services running on host h2,
   SSH and FTP, using port 22 and port 20, respectively.  An efficient
   flow configuration supported by OpenFlow, is to use a low latency
   link to transfer SSH packets and a high speed route to transfer
   files.  So sw1 and sw2 will exchange the SSH flows with each other to
   achieve a lower latency and forward FTP flows to sw3 to achieve a
   higher bandwidth.

   In this case, the SDN network uses suitable links to transfer
   different packets, so the cost between IP addresses is protocol or
   port related.  However, ECS cannot use this information to give a
   precise result.

       Figure 2: A simple example of protocol or port based routing.

   Use case 3:

   ECS is not compatible with other addresses such as MAC addresses or
   physical connectors.  For example, some protocols such as ARP send
   packets by MAC addresses.  ECS is unable to measure the cost between
   two NICs without IP addresses.  The ALTO, as an information source,
   cannot compute the cost between two physic ports, either.  These
   knowledge seems useless for the Internet users, but useful for ISPs.

3.  Overview Of Approach

   This section contains the non-normative overview of the ECS extension
   for flows defined in this document.  It assumes that the readers are
   familiar with the ALTO Protocol ([RFC7285]).

3.1.  Multi-Field Typed Endpoint Address Format

   The typed endpoint address used by ECS is defined in {10.4} of
   [RFC7285].  That section only defines two address types: ipv4 and
   ipv6 to refer IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses, respectively.
   However, the flow-extended ECS may contain MAC addresses, domain
   names and port numbers to give a cost between hosts.

   Therefore, this document extends the address type and the typed
   endpoint address to allow ECS to measure the cost more precisely.

Internet-Draft                  ECS Flow                    October 2015


   For example, the following are some Multi-Field Type Endpoint
   Addresses.  These fields in an address are interpreted as being
   related to each other with a logical AND.

               "ipv4:10.60.10.1;protocol:ssh;port:22"
               "ipv6:2001:da8::10;protocol:ftp;port:21"
               "domainname:www.a.com;protocol:http;port:80"

   And a request to query the cost between hosts looks like this:

              {
                "cost-type": {"cost-mode" : "ordinal",
                              "cost-metric" : "routingcost"},
                "endpoints" : {
                  "srcs": [ "ipv4:192.0.2.2" ],
                  "dsts": [
                    "ipv4:192.0.2.89;protocol:ssh",
                    "domainname:www.a.com;port:80",
                    "ipv4:203.0.113.45"
                  ]
                }
              }

3.2.  Compatibility With Legacy Clients

   The extension defined in this document should be compatible with
   legacy implementations, which means clients and servers are not aware
   of this extension.  A good way to achieve this goal is defining new
   media types for extended endpoint cost map.  Based on the fact that
   the extended address looks alike the original typed endpoint address,
   it would be a simpler way to implement a parser which can handle both
   typed endpoint addresses.

   Therefore, no new media type is defined in this document.  Instead,
   this document extends the specifications of Information Resource
   Directory (IRD) in the ALTO protocol.  Because the legacy ALTO
   clients MUST ignore unknown fields (see {8.3.7} of [RFC7285]), the
   legacy implementations will not use the extended typed endpoint
   address and are not aware of the existence of this extension.

3.3.  Endpoint Cost Resources

   This document extends the endpoint cost service in IRD to allow the
   same resource to receive either legacy typed endpoint addresses as
   defined in {10.4} of [RFC7285], or extended typed endpoint addresses
   as defined in this document.  The extended endpoint cost resource has
   a new capability called "flow-extension", which indicates supported

Internet-Draft                  ECS Flow                    October 2015


   address types and fields.  The existence of this value means that the
   resource understands this extension.

   For example, an extended endpoint cost resource in IRD is shown
   below:

         "endpoint-cost" : {
           "uri" : "http://alto.example.com/endpointcost/lookup",
           "media-type" : "application/alto-endpointcost+json",
           "accepts" : "application/alto-endpointcostparams+json",
           "capabilities" : {
             "cost-constraints" : true,
             "flow-extension" : {
                 "address-types"  : [ "mac", "domainname" ],
                 "field-names"    : [ "port", "protocol" ]
             },
             "cost-type-names" : [ "num-routing", "num-hop",
                                   "ord-routing", "ord-hop" ]
           }
         }

   The legacy implementations SHOULD ignore the unknown capability:
   "flow-extension", and will send requests with the typed endpoint
   address, as defined in [RFC7285].  So the ALTO server should return a
   non-extended legacy cost map.

   However, an extended client will realize that this resource supports
   the extension to flows, and can POST the request with extended typed
   endpoint addresses.  The server can understand that the client
   supports the extension in this document by parsing the extended
   endpoint addresses, and hence response with the extended cost map.

4.  Protocol Extension for Flow-Extended ECS

4.1.  Endpoints Extensions

   This document extends Endpoint, as defined in {10.4} of [RFC7285], by
   adding ';' character to separate different fields in an address, and
   by adding more address types to indicate other fields.

4.1.1.  Multi-Field Typed Endpoint Addresses

   The Typed Endpoint Addresses, as defined in {10.4.1} of [RFC7285],
   are encoded as strings of the format: AddressType:EndpointAddr.  This
   document extends it as the format: AddressType:EndpointAddr((;FieldNa
   me:FieldValue)|(;AddressType:EndpointAddr))*.

4.1.2.  Address Type

   This document extends Address Type, as defined in {10.4.2} of
   [RFC7285], by adding two values to AddressType: "mac" and
   "domainname" to refer to MAC addresses and domain names.

4.1.3.  Endpoint Address

   This document extends Endpoint Address, as defined in {10.4.3} of
   [RFC7285], by defining more EndpointAddr when AddressType is "mac" or
   "domainname".

4.1.3.1.  MAC

   MAC Endpoint Addresses are encoded as specified in Section 3 of
   [RFC7042].

4.1.3.2.  Domain Name

   Domain Name Addresses are encoded as specified in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC1034].

4.1.4.  Field Name

   The FieldName component of MultiFiledTypedEndPointAddr is defined as
   a string consisting of only US-ASCII alphanumeric characters
   (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+005A, and U+0061-U+007A).  The type
   FieldName is used in this document to indicate a string of this
   format.  This document does not define any value of FieldName.
   Hence, ALTO clients and servers SHOULD interpret the meanings of
   FieldName by themselves.

4.1.5.  Field Value

   The FieldValue component of MultiFiledTypedEndPointAddr is defined as
   a string consisting of only US-ASCII alphanumeric characters
   (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+005A, and U+0061-U+007A).  The type
   FieldValue is used in this document to indicate a string of this
   format.  This document does not define any value of FieldValue.
   Hence, ALTO clients and servers SHOULD interpret the meanings of
   FieldValue by themselves.

4.2.  Endpoint Cost Service Extensions

   This document extends the Endpoint Cost Service, as defined in
   {11.5.1} of [RFC7285], by adding new capabilities and extending
   TypedEndpointAddr.

   The media type ({11.5.1.1} of [RFC7285]), HTTP method ({11.5.1.2} of
   [RFC7285]) and "uses" specifications ({11.5.1.5} of [RFC7285]) are
   unchanged.

4.2.1.  Accept Input Parameters

   The ReqEndpointCostMap object in {11.5.1.3} of [RFC7285] is extended
   as follows:

           object {
             CostType                   cost-type;
             [JSONString                constraints<0..*>;]
             EndpointFilter             endpoints;
             [MultiFieldEndpointFilter  multi-field-endpoints;]
           } ReqEndpointCostMap;

           object {
             [TypedEndpointAddr srcs<0..*>;]
             [TypedEndpointAddr dsts<0..*>;]
           } EndpointFilter;


           object {
             [MultiFieldTypedEndpointAddr srcs<0..*>;]
             [MultiFieldTypedEndpointAddr dsts<0..*>;]
           } MultiFieldEndpointFilter;

   With fields:

   cost-type, constrains, endpoints:  As defined in {11.5.1.3} of
      [RFC7285].

   multi-field-endpoints:  If present, this field is the same as
      endpoints defined in {11.5.1.3} of [RFC7285], with the additional
      requirement that the ALTO server MUST ignore the endpoints field,
      and use srcs and dsts in the multi-field-endpoints to calculate
      the cost and return an extended response in this document.  The
      AddressType and FieldName in each MultiFieldTypedEndpointAddr MUST
      be declared in the capability of this resource.

4.2.2.  Capabilities

   The EndpointCostCapabilities object in {11.5.1.4} of [RFC7285] is
   extended as follows:

                    object {
                      JSONString cost-type-names<1..*>;
                      JSONBool cost-constraints;
                      [FlowExtension flow-extension;]
                    } EndpointCostCapabilities;

                    object {
                      [JSONString address-types<1..*>;]
                      [JSONString field-names<1..*>;]
                    } FlowExtension;

   With fields:

   cost-type-names, cost-constrains:  As defined in {11.5.1.4} of
      [RFC7285].

   flow-extension:  Defines lists of supported address types and field
      names of this resource.  If present with one or two lists, this
      resource understands the flow-extension in this document and MUST
      support MultiFieldTypedEndpointAddr.  If omitted, the default
      value is an empty object.

   address-types:  Defines a list of supported address type.  The values
      in this list MUST be defined in Section 4.1.2 in this document.
      If present with one or more values, the ALTO server MUST support
      these values as extended endpoint address type.  If omitted, the
      default value is an empty list, which means the server does not
      support any address type other than ipv4 and ipv6.

   field-names:  Defines a list of supported field names.  The values in
      this list are defined in Section 4.1.4 in this document.  If
      present with one or more values, the ALTO server MUST support
      these values as field names.  If omitted, the default value is an
      empty list.

4.2.3.  Response

   If the client does not provide "multi-field-endpoints" input
   parameter, the response is exactly as defined in {11.5.1.6} of
   [RFC7285].  If the client provides the "multi-field-endpoints", the
   response is changed as follows:

   o  In the EndpointCostMapData object, replace the TypedEndpointAddr
      field with MultiFieldTypedEndpointAddr.

   o  In the EndpointDstCosts object, replace the TypedEndpointAddr
      field with MultiFieldTypedEndpointAddr.
