               Expressing Confidence in a Location Object
                  draft-thomson-geopriv-confidence-03

Abstract

   A confidence element is described that expresses the estimated
   probability that the associated location information is correct.
   This element conveys information that might otherwise be lost about
   the probability distribution represented by a region of uncertainty.

Internet-Draft                 Confidence                   October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Location information is often less than perfect.  Two measures are
   used to quantify how imperfect the location information is:
   uncertainty and confidence.  These terms, and their relationship with
   location information are explored in detail in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty].  Standard forms for the expression
   of uncertainty are included in [RFC5491], but confidence is fixed to
   a value of 95%.

   On the whole, a fixed definition for confidence ensures consistency
   between implementations.  Location generators that are aware of this
   constraint can generate location information at the required
   confidence.  Location recipients are able to make sensible
   assumptions about the quality of the information that they receive.

   In some circumstances - particularly with pre-existing systems -
   location generators might provide location information with some
   other confidence.  Common values include 38%, 67% and 90%; all of
   which are prevalent in current systems.  Existing forms of expressing
   location information, such as that defined in [3GPP-TS-23_032],
   contain elements that express the confidence in the result.

   The addition of a confidence element provides information that was
   previously unavailable to recipients of location information.
   Without this information, a location server or generator that has
   access to location information with a confidence lower than 95% has
   two options:

   o  The location server can scale regions of uncertainty in an attempt
      to acheive 95% confidence.  This scaling process significantly
      degrades the quality of the information, because the location
      server might not have the necessary information to scale
      appropriately; the location server is forced to make assumptions
      that are likely result in either an overly conservative estimate
      with high uncertainty or a overestimate of confidence.

   o  The location server can ignore the confidence entirely, which
      results in giving the recipient a false impression of its quality.

   Both of these choices degrade the quality of the information
   provided.

   The addition of a confidence element avoids this problem entirely if
   a location recipient supports and understands the element.  A
   recipient that does not understand, and hence ignores, the confidence
   element is in no worse a position than if the location server ignored
   confidence.

Internet-Draft                 Confidence                   October 2010


1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document relies on the definitions in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty] and [RFC3693].

2.  Representation of Confidence in PIDF-LO

   The confidence element MAY be added to the "location-info" element of
   the Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO)
   [RFC4119] document.  This element expresses the confidence in the
   associated location information as a percentage.

   The confidence element optionally includes an attribute that
   indicates the shape of the probability density function (PDF) of the
   associated region of uncertainty.  Three values are possible:
   unknown, normal and rectangular.

   Indicating a particular PDF only indicates that the distribution
   approximately fits the given shape based on the methods used to
   generate the location information.  The PDF is normal if there are a
   large number of small, independent sources of error; rectangular if
   all points within the area have roughly equal probability of being
   the actual location of the Target; otherwise, the PDF MUST either be
   set to unknown or omitted.

   If a PIDF-LO does not include the confidence element, confidence is
   95% [RFC5491].  A Point shape does not have uncertainty (or it has
   infinite uncertainty), so confidence is meaningless for a point;
   therefore, this element MUST be omitted if only a point is provided.

   Location generators SHOULD attempt to ensure that confidence is equal
   in each dimension when generating location information.  This
   restriction, while not always possible, allows for more accurate
   scaling, if scaling is necessary.

   Confidence SHOULD NOT be included unless location information cannot
   be acquired with 95% confidence.  Confidence SHOULD NOT be included
   with civic address information; civic addresses are less subject to
   variable errors than geodetic positions.

3.  Example

   The PIDF-LO document in Figure 1 includes a representation of
   uncertainty as a circular area.  The confidence element (on the line

   marked with a comment) indicates that the confidence is 67% and that
   it follows a normal distribution.
