1.  Introduction

   A Deterministic Networking (DetNet) service provides a capability to
   carry a unicast or a multicast data flow for an application with
   constrained requirements on network performance, e.g., low packet
   loss rate and/or latency.  DetNet and TSN have common architecture as
   expressed in [IETFDetNet] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  The
   DetNet service is provided for DetNet flows via the DetNet service
   and forwarding sub-layers.

   DetNet service is IP or MPLS and DetNet is currently defined for IP
   and MPLS networks as shown in Figure 1 based on Figure 2 and Figure 3
   of [I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework].  A DetNet flow includes
   one or more App-flow(s) as payload.  App-flows can be Ethernet, MPLS,
   or IP flows, which impacts what header fields are use in order to
   identify a flow.  DetNet flows are created by DetNet encapsulation of
   App-flow(s) (e.g., with added MPLS labels, etc.).  In some scenarios
   App-flow and DetNet flow look similar on the wire (e.g., L3 App-flow
   over a DetNet IP network).

   As shown in Figure 1 as per [I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework] a
   DetNet flow can be treated as an application level flow (App-flow)
   e.g., at DetNet flow aggregation or in a sub-network that
   interconnects DetNet nodes.

   The DetNet flow and service information model provided by this
   document contains both DetNet flow and App-flow specific information
   in an integrated fashion.

   In a given network scenario three information models can
   distinguished:

   o  Flow models describe characteristics of data flows.  These models
      describe in detail all relevant aspects of a flow that are needed
      to support the flow properly by the network between the source and
      the destination(s).

   o  Service models describe characteristics of services being provided
      for data flows over a network.  These models can be treated as a
      network operator independent information model.

   o  Configuration models describe in detail the settings required on
      network nodes to serve a data flow properly.

   Service and flow information models are used between the user and the
   network operator.  Configuration information models are used between
   the management/control plane entity of the network and the network
   nodes.  They are shown in Figure 2.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model            July 2019


   DetNet flow and service information model is based on
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and on the concept of data model
   specified by [IEEE8021Qcc].  Furthermore, the starting point of the
   DetNet flow information model was the flow identification
   possibilities described in [IEEE8021CB], which is used by
   [IEEE8021Qcc] as well.  In addition to TSN data model, [IEEE8021Qcc]
   also specifies configuration of TSN features (e.g., traffic
   scheduling specified by [IEEE8021Qbv]).  Due to the common
   architecture and flow model, configuration features can be leveraged
   in certain deployment scenarios, e.g., when the network that provides
   the DetNet service includes both L3 and L2 network segments.

1.1.  Goals

   As it is expressed in the Charter [IETFDetNet], the DetNet WG
   collaborates with IEEE 802.1 TSN in order to define a common
   architecture for both Layer 2 and Layer 3, which is beneficial for
   various reasons, e.g., in order to simplify implementations.  The
   flow and service information models should be also aligned along
   those lines.  Therefore, the DetNet flow and service information
   models described in this document are based on [IEEE8021Qcc], which
   is an amendment to [IEEE8021Q].

   This document intends to specify flow and service information models
   only.

1.2.  Non Goals

   This document (this revision) does not intend to specify either flow
   data model or DetNet configuration.  From these aspects, the goals of
   this document differ from the goals of [IEEE8021Qcc], which also
   specifies data model and configuration of certain TSN features.

   App-flow      The payload (data) carried over a DetNet service.

   DetNet flow   A DetNet flow is a sequence of packets which conform
                 uniquely to a flow identifier, and to which the DetNet
                 service is to be provided.  It includes any DetNet

3.  DetNet Domain and its Modeling

3.1.  DetNet Service Overview

   The DetNet service can be defined as a service that provides a
   capability to carry a unicast or a multicast data flow for an
   application with constrained requirements on network performance,
   e.g., low packet loss rate and/or latency.

   Figure 5. and Figure 8. in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] show the
   DetNet service related reference points and main components.

3.2.  Reference Points Used in Modeling

   From service design perspective a fundamental question is the
   location of the service/flow endpoints, i.e., where the service/flow
   starts and ends.

   App-flow specific reference points are the Source (where it starts)
   and the Destination (where it terminates).  Similarly a DetNet flow
   have reference points named as DN Ingress (where it starts) and DN
   Egress (where it ends).  These reference points may coexist in the
   same node (e.g., in a DetNet IP end system).  DN Ingress and DN
   Egress reference points are intermediate reference points for a
   served App-flow.

   All reference points are assumed in this document to be packet-based
   reference points.  A DN Ingress may add and a DN Egress may remove
   networking technology specific encapsulation to/from the served App-
   flow(s) (e.g., MPLS label(s), UDP and IP headers).

3.3.  Information Elements

   The DetNet flow information model and the service model relies on
   three groups of information elements:

   o  App-flow related paramaters: they describe the App-flow
      characteristics (e.g., identification, encapsulation, traffic
      specification, endpoints, status, etc.) and the App-flow
      requirements (e.g., delay, loss, etc.).

   o  DetNet flow related parameters: they describe the DetNet flow
      characteristics (e.g., identification, format, traffic
      specification, endpoints, rank, etc.).

   o  DetNet service related parameters: they describe the expected
      service characteristics (e.g., delivery type, connectivity delay/
      loss, status, rank, etc.).

   In the information model a DetNet flow contains one or more App-flows
   (N:1 mapping).  During DetNet aggregation the aggregated DetNet flows
   are treated as App-flows and the aggregate is the DetNet flow, which
   provides N:1 mapping.  Similarly, there is a M:1 relationship of
   DetNet flow(s) and a DetNet Service.

4.  App-flow Related Parameters

   Deterministic service is required by time/loss sensitive
   application(s) running on an end system during communication with its
   peer(s).  Such a data exchange has various requirements on delay and/
   or loss parameters.

4.1.  App-flow Characteristics

   App-flow characteristics are described with the following parameters:

   o  FlowID: it is a unique (management) identifier of the App-flow.
      It can be used to define the N:1 mapping of App-flows to a DetNet
      flow.

   o  FlowType: it is set according to the encapsulation format of the
      flow.  It can be Ethernet (TSN), MPLS, or IP.

   o  DataFlowSpecification: it is a flow descriptor, defining which
      packets belongs to a flow using, e.g., FlowType specific packet
      header fields like src-addr, dst-addr, label, VLAN-ID, etc.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model            July 2019


   o  TrafficSpecification: it is a flow descriptor, defining traffic
      parameters like packet size, interval, and max. packets per
      interval.

   o  FlowEndpoints: it defines the start and termination reference
      points of the App-flow by pointing to the source interface/node
      and destination interface(s)/node(s).

   o  FlowStatus: it provides the status of the App-flow with respect to
      the establishment of the flow by the network, e.g., ready, failed,
      etc.

   o  FlowRank: it provides the rank of this flow relative to other
      flows in the network.

4.2.  App-flow Requirements

   App-flow requirements are described with the following parameters:

   o  FlowRequirements: it defines the requirement of the App-flow
      regarding bandwidth, latency, latency variation, loss, and
      misorder tolerance.

   o  FlowBiDir: it defines the requirement of the App-flow whether it
      has to be routed together with other App-flow(s) through the
      network, e.g., to provide congruent paths in the two directions.

5.  DetNet Flow Related Parameters

   Data model specified by [IEEE8021Qcc] describes data flows using TSN
   service as periodic flows with fix packet size (i.e., Constant Bit
   Rate (CBR) flows) or with variable packet size.  The same concept is
   applyed for flows using DetNet service.

   Latency and loss parameters are correlated because the effect of late
   delivery can result data loss for an application.  However, not all
   applications require hard limits on both parameters (latency and
   loss).  For example, some real-time applications allow graceful
   degradation if loss happens (e.g., sample-based processing, media
   distribution).  Some others may require high-bandwidth connections
   that make the usage of techniques like packet replication
   economically challenging or even impossible.  Some applications may
   not tolerate loss, but are not latency sensitive (e.g., bufferless
   sensors).  Time/loss sensitive applications may have somewhat special
   requirements especially for loss (e.g., no loss in two consecutive
   communication cycles; very low outage time, etc.).

   DetNet flows have the following attributes:

   f.  DnFlowEndpoints (Section 5.6)

   g.  DnFlowRank (Section 5.7)

   h.  DnFlowStatus (Section 5.8)

   DetNet flows have the following requirement attributes:

   o  DnFlowRequirements (Section 5.9)

   o  DnFlowBiDir (Section 5.10)

   Flow attributes are described in the following sections.

5.1.  Management ID of the DetNet Flow

   A unique (management) identifier is needed for each DetNet flow
   within the DetNet domain.  It is specified in DnFlowID.  It can be
   used to define the M:1 mapping of DetNet flows to a DetNet service.

5.2.  Payload type of the DetNet Flow

   DnPayloadType attribute is set according to encapsulated App-flow
   format.  The attribute can be Ethernet, MPLS, or IP.

5.3.  Format of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowFormat attribute is set according to DetNet PSN technology.
   The attribute can be MPLS or IP.

5.4.  Identification and Specification of DetNet Flows

   Identification options for DetNet flows at the Ingress/Egress and
   within the DetNet domain are specified as follows; see Section 5.4.1
   for DetNet MPLS flows and Section 5.4.2 for DetNetw IP flows.

5.4.1.  DetNet MPLS Flow Identification and Specification

   Identification of DetNet MPLS flows within the DetNet domain are used
   in the service information model.  The attributes are specific to the
   MPLS forwarding paradigm within the DetNet domain
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  DetNetwork MPLS flows can be identified and
   specified by the following attributes:

   a.  SLabel

   b.  FLabelStack

5.4.2.  DetNet IP Flow Identification and Specification

   DetNet IP flows can be identified and specified by the following
   attributes (6-tuple) [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]:

   a.  SourceIpAddress

   b.  DestinationIpAddress

   c.  IPv6FlowLabel

   d.  Dscp

   e.  Protocol

   f.  SourcePort

   g.  DestinationPort

5.5.  Traffic Specification of the DetNet Flow

   DnTrafficSpecification attributes specify how the DN Ingress
   transmits packets for the DetNet flow.  This is effectively the
   promise/request of the DN Ingress to the network.  The network uses
   this traffic specification to allocate resources and adjust queue
   parameters in network nodes.

   TrafficSpecification has the following attributes:

   a.  Interval: the period of time in which the traffic specification
       cannot be exceeded.

   b.  MaxPacketsPerInterval: the maximum number of packets that the
       Ingress will transmit in one Interval.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model            July 2019


   c.  MaxPayloadSize: the maximum payload size that the Ingress will
       transmit.

   These attributes can be used to describe any type of traffic (e.g.,
   CBR, VBR, etc.) and can be used during resource allocation to
   represent worst case scenarios.

   [[Editor's note (to be removed from a future revision): Further
   optional attributes can be considered to achieve more efficient
   resource allocation.  Such optional attributes might be worth for
   flows with soft requirements (i.e., the flow is only loss sensitive
   or only delay sensitive, but not both d elay-and-loss sensitive).
   Possible options how to extend DnTrafficSpecification attributes is
   for further discussion. ]]

5.6.  Endpoints of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowEndpoints attribute defines the starting and termination
   reference points of the DetNet flow by pointing to the ingress
   interface/node and egress interface(s)/node(s).  Depending on the
   network scenario it defines an interface or a node.  Interface can be
   defined for example if the App-flow is a TSN Stream and it is
   received over a well defined UNI interface.  For exampe for App-flows
   with MPLS encapsulation defining an ingress node is more common when
   per platform label space is used.

5.7.  Rank of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowRank provides the rank of this flow relative to other flows in
   the DetNet domain.  Rank (range: 0-255) is used by the DetNet domain
   to decide which flows can and cannot exist when network resources
   reach their limit.  Rank is used to help to determine which flows can
   be dropped (i.e., removed from node configuration) if for example a
   port of a node becomes oversubscribed (e.g., due to network re-
   configuration).

5.8.  Status of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowStatus provides the status of the DetNet flow with respect to
   the establishment of the flow by the DetNet domain.

   The DnFlowStatus SHALL include the following attributes:

   a.  DnIngressStatus is an enumeration for the status of the flow's
       Ingress reference point:

       *  None: no Ingress.

       *  Ready: Ingress is ready.

       *  Failed: Ingress failed.

       *  OutOfService: Administratively blocked.

   b.  DnEgressStatus is an enumeration for the status of the flow's
       Egress reference points:

       *  None: no Egress.

       *  Ready: all Egresses are ready.

       *  PartialFailed: One or more Egress ready, and one or more
          Egress failed.  The DetNet flow can be used if the Ingress is
          Ready.

       *  Failed: All Egresses failed.

       *  OutOfService: Administratively blocked.

   c.  FailureCode: A non-zero code that specifies the problem if the
       DetNet flow encounters a failure (e.g., packet replication and
       elimination is requested but not possible, or DnIngressStatus is
       Failed, or DnEgressStatus is Failed, or DnEgressStatus is
       PartialFailed).

   [[Editor's note (to be removed from a future revision): FailureCodes
   to be defined for DetNet.  Table 46-1 of [IEEE8021Qcc] describes TSN
   failure codes.]]

   required, misordering cannot be tolerated.

5.10.  BiDir requirement of the DetNet Flow

   DnFlowBiDir attribute defines the requirement whether the served
   packets have to be routed together with packets of other flows
   through the DetNet domain, e.g., to provide congruent paths in the
   two directions.

   DnServiceFailureCodes to be defined for DetNet service.  Table 46-1
   of [IEEE8021Qcc] describes TSN failure codes.]]

7.  Flow Specific Operations

   The DetNet flow information model relies on three high level
   information groups:

   o  DnIngress: The DnIngress information group includes elements that
      specify the source for a single DetNet flow.  This information
      group is applied from the user of the DetNet service to the
      network.

   o  DnEgress: The DnEgress information group includes elements that
      specify the destination for a single DetNet flow.  This
      information group is applied from the user of the DetNet service
      to the network.

   o  DnFlowStatus: The status information group includes elements that
      specify the status of the flow in the network.  This information
      group is applied from the network to the user of the DetNet
      service.  This information group informs the user whether or not
      the DetNet flow is ready for use.

   There are three possible operations for each DetNet flow with respect
   to its DetNet service at a DN Ingress or a DN Egress (similarly to
   App-flows at a Source or a Destination):

   o  Join: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to join the flow.

   o  Leave: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to leave the flow.

   o  Modify: DN Ingress/DN Egress intends to change the flow.

7.1.  Join Operation

   For the join operation, the DnFlowSpecification, DnFlowRank,
   DnFlowEndpoint, and DnTrafficSpecification SHALL be included within
   the DnIngress or DnEgress information group.  For the join operation,
   the DnServiceRequirements groups MAY be included.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model            July 2019


7.2.  Leave Operation

   For the leave operation, the DnFlowSpecification and DnFlowEndpoint
   SHALL be included within the DnIngress or DnEgress information group.

7.3.  Modify Operation

   For the modify operation, the DnFlowSpecification, DnFlowRank,
   DnFlowEndpoint, and DnTrafficSpecification SHALL be included within
   the DnIngress or DnEgress information group.  For the join operation,
   the DnServiceRequirements groups MAY be included.

   Modify operation can be considered to address cases when a flow is
   slightly changed, e.g., only MaxPayloadSize (Section 5.5) has been
   changed.  The advantage of having a Modify is that it allows to
   initiate a change of flow spec while leaving the current flow is
   operating until the change is accepted.  If there is no linkage
   between the Join and the Leave, then in figuring out whether the new
   flow spec can be supported, the controller entity has to assume that
   the resources committed to the current flow are in use.  Via Modify
   the controller entity knows that the resources supporting the current
   flow can be available for supporting the altered flow.  Modify is
   considered to be an optional operation due to possible controller
   plane limitations.
