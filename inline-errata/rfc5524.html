Abstract

   The URLFETCH command defined as part of URLAUTH provides a mechanism
   for third parties to gain access to data held within messages in a
   user&#x27;s private store; however, this data is sent verbatim, which is
   not suitable for a number of applications.  This memo specifies a
   method for obtaining data in forms suitable for non-mail
   applications.

1.  Introduction

   Although [URLAUTH] provides a URLFETCH command that can be used to
   dereference a URL and return the body-part data, it does so by
   returning the encoded form, without sufficient metadata to decode.
   This is suitable for use in mail applications such as [BURL], where
   the encoded form is suitable, but not where access to the actual
   content is required, such as in [STREAMING].

   This memo specifies a mechanism that returns additional metadata
   about the part, such as its [MEDIATYPE] type, as well as removes any
   content transfer encoding that was used on the body part.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

   Protocol examples are line-wrapped for clarity.  Protocol strings are
   prefixed with C: and S: for client and server respectively, and
   elided data is represented by [...].  Implementors should note these
   notations are for editorial clarity only.

3.  Extended URLFETCH

   This extension is available in any IMAP server implementation that
   includes URLAUTH=BINARY within its capability string.

   Such servers accept additional, per-URL parameters to the URLFETCH
   command and will provide, upon request, specific data for each URL
   dereferenced.

3.1.  Command Parameters

   The URLFETCH command is extended by the provision of optional
   parameters.  The extended URLFETCH command is distinct by enclosing
   each URL and associated parameters in a parenthesized list.  Cases
   where there is an absence of any parameters or where the URL is sent
   unenclosed cause the command to behave precisely as specified in
   [URLAUTH].

   Similarly, if the URL is invalid, the command will behave precisely
   as specified in [URLAUTH] and return a simple NIL.

   Available parameters are:

   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
      Provide a BODYPARTSTRUCTURE.

      BODYPARTSTRUCTURE is defined in [CONVERT] and provides metadata
      useful for processing applications, such as the type of data.

   BINARY
      Provide the data without any Content-Transfer-Encoding.

      In particular, this means that the data MAY contain NUL octets and
      not be formed from textual lines.  Data containing NUL octets MUST
      be transferred using the literal8 syntax defined in [BINARY].

   BODY
      Provide the data as-is.

      This will provide the same data as the unextended [URLAUTH] as a
      metadata item.

   Metadata items MUST NOT appear more than once per URL requested, and
   clients MUST NOT request both BINARY and BODY.

3.2.  Response Metadata

   In order to carry any requested metadata and provide additional
   information to the consumer, the URLFETCH response is similarly
   extended.

   Following the URL itself, servers will include a series of
   parenthesized metadata elements.  Defined metadata elements are as
   follows:

   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
      The BODYPARTSTRUCTURE provides information about the data
      contained in the response, as it has been returned.  It will
      reflect any conversions or decoding that have taken place.  In
      particular, this will show an identity encoding if BINARY is also
      requested.

   BINARY
      The BINARY item provides the content, without any content transfer
      encoding applied.  If this is not possible (for example, the
      content transfer encoding is unknown to the server), then this MAY
      contain NIL.  Servers MUST understand all identity content
      transfer encodings defined in [MIME], as well as the
      transformation encodings &quot;Base64&quot; [BASE64] and &quot;Quoted-Printable&quot;
      [MIME].

   BODY
      The BODY item provides the content as found in the message, with
      any content transfer encoding still applied.  Requesting only the
      BODY will provide equivalent functionality to the unextended
      [URLAUTH], however, using the extended syntax described herein.

   Note that unlike [CONVERT], BODYPARTSTRUCTURE is not appended with
   the part specifier, as this is implicit in the URL.

4.  Example Exchanges

   A client requests the data with no content transfer encoding.

      C: A001 URLFETCH  (&quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.2;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         91354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; BINARY)
      S: * URLFETCH &quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.2;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         91354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; (BINARY {28}
      S: Si vis pacem, para bellum.
      S:
      S: )
      S: A001 OK URLFETCH completed

   Note that the data here does not contain a NUL octet; therefore, a
   literal -- not literal8 -- syntax has been used.

   A client again requests data with no content transfer encoding, but
   this time requests the body structure.

      C: A001 URLFETCH  (&quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.3;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         ae354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; BINARY BODYPARTSTRUCTURE)
      S: * URLFETCH &quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.3;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         ae354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
         (&quot;IMAGE&quot; &quot;PNG&quot; () NIL NIL &quot;BINARY&quot; 123)) (BINARY ~{123}
      S: [123 octets of data, some of which is NUL])
      S: A001 OK URLFETCH completed

   A client requests only the body structure.

      C: A001 URLFETCH  (&quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.3;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         ae354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; BODYPARTSTRUCTURE)
      S: * URLFETCH &quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.3;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         ae354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
         (&quot;IMAGE&quot; &quot;PNG&quot; () NIL NIL &quot;BASE64&quot; 164))
      S: A001 OK URLFETCH completed

   A client requests the body structure and the original content.

      C: A001 URLFETCH  (&quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.3;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         ae354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; BODYPARTSTRUCTURE BODY)
      S: * URLFETCH &quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.3;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         ae354a473744909de610943775f92038&quot; (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
         (&quot;IMAGE&quot; &quot;PNG&quot; () NIL NIL &quot;BASE64&quot; 164)) (BODY {164}
      S: [164 octets of base64 encoded data])
      S: A001 OK URLFETCH completed

   Some parts cannot be decoded, so the server will provide the
   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE of the part as is and provide NIL for the binary
   content:

      C: A001 URLFETCH (&quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.4;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         87ecbd02095b815e699503fc20d869c8&quot; BODYPARTSTRUCTURE BINARY)
      S: * URLFETCH &quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=1.4;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         87ecbd02095b815e699503fc20d869c8&quot; (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
         (&quot;IMAGE&quot; &quot;PNG&quot; () NIL NIL &quot;X-BLURDYBLOOP&quot; 123))
         (BINARY NIL)
      S: A001 OK URLFETCH completed

   If a part simply doesn&#x27;t exist, however, or the URI is invalid for
   some other reason, then NIL is returned instead of metadata:

      C: A001 URLFETCH (&quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=200;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         88066d37e2e5410e1a6486350a8836ee&quot; BODYPARTSTRUCTURE BODY)
      S: * URLFETCH &quot;imap://joe@example.com/INBOX/;uid=20/;
         section=200;urlauth=anonymous:internal:
         88066d37e2e5410e1a6486350a8836ee&quot; NIL
      S: A001 OK URLFETCH completed

5.  Formal Syntax

   This formal syntax uses ABNF as specified in [ABNF], and includes
   productions defined in [URLAUTH], [BINARY], and [IMAP].

   capability       =/ &quot;URLAUTH=BINARY&quot;

      ; Command parameters; see Section 3.1

   urlfetch         =  &quot;URLFETCH&quot; 1*(SP url-fetch-arg)

   url-fetch-arg    =  url-fetch-simple / url-fetch-ext

   url-fetch-simple =  url-full
      ; Unextended URLFETCH.

   url-fetch-ext    =  &quot;(&quot; url-full *(SP url-fetch-param) &quot;)&quot;
      ; If no url-fetch-param present, as unextended.

   url-fetch-param  =  &quot;BODY&quot; / &quot;BINARY&quot; / &quot;BODYPARTSTRUCTURE&quot; / atom

      ; Response; see Section 3.2

   urlfetch-data    =  &quot;*&quot; SP &quot;URLFETCH&quot;
                       1*(SP (urldata-simple / urldata-ext /
                              urldata-error))

   urldata-error    =  SP url-full SP nil

   urldata-simple   =  SP url-full SP nstring
      ; If client issues url-fetch-simple, server MUST respond with
      ; urldata-simple.

   urldata-ext      =  SP url-full url-metadata

   url-metadata     =  1*(SP &quot;(&quot; url-metadata-el &quot;)&quot;)

   url-metadata-el  =  url-meta-bodystruct / url-meta-body /
                       url-meta-binary

   url-meta-bodystruct   =  &quot;BODYPARTSTRUCTURE&quot; SP body

   url-meta-binary       =  &quot;BINARY&quot; SP ( nstring / literal8 )
      ; If content contains a NUL octet, literal8 MUST be used.
      ; Otherwise, content SHOULD use nstring.
      ; On decoding error, NIL should be used.

   url-meta-body         =  &quot;BODY&quot; SP nstring

6.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a Standards Track or
   IESG-approved Experimental RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   Implementors are directed to the security considerations within
   [IMAP], [URLAUTH], and [BINARY].

   The ability of the holder of a URL to be able to fetch metadata about
   the content pointed to by the URL as well as the content itself
   allows a potential attacker to discover more about the content than
   was previously possible, including its original filename and user-
   supplied description.

   The additional value of this information to an attacker is marginal,
   and applies only to those URLs for which the attacker does not have
   direct access, such as those produced by [URLAUTH].  Implementors are
   therefore directed to the security considerations present in
   [URLAUTH].
