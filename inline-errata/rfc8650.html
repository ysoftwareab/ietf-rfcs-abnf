1.  Introduction

   Mechanisms to support event subscription and YANG-Push are defined in
   [RFC8639].  Enhancements to [RFC8639] that enable YANG datastore
   subscription and YANG-Push are defined in [RFC8641].  This document
   provides a transport specification for dynamic subscriptions over
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Requirements for these mechanisms are captured
   in [RFC7923].

   The streaming of notifications that encapsulate the resulting
   information push is done via the mechanism described in Section 6.3
   of [RFC8040].

2.  Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms use the definitions from [RFC8639]: dynamic
   subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher,
   receiver, subscriber, and subscription.

   Other terms reused include datastore, which is defined in [RFC8342],
   and HTTP/2 stream, which maps to the definition of &quot;stream&quot; within
   [RFC7540], Section 2.

3.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   This section provides specifics on how to establish and maintain
   dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Subscribing to event
   streams is accomplished in this way via RPCs defined within
   [RFC8639], Section 2.4.  The RPCs are done via RESTCONF POSTs.  YANG
   datastore subscription is accomplished via augmentations to [RFC8639]
   as described within [RFC8641], Section 4.4.

   As described in Section 6.3 of [RFC8040], a GET needs to be performed
   on a specific URI on the publisher.  Subscribers cannot predetermine
   the URI against which a subscription might exist on a publisher, as
   the URI will only exist after the &quot;establish-subscription&quot; RPC has
   been accepted.  Therefore, the POST for the &quot;establish-subscription&quot;
   RPC replaces the GET request for the &quot;location&quot; leaf that is used in
   [RFC8040] to obtain the URI.  The subscription URI will be determined
   and sent as part of the response to the &quot;establish-subscription&quot; RPC,
   and a subsequent GET to this URI will be done in order to start the
   flow of notification messages back to the subscriber.  As specified
   in Section 2.4.1 of [RFC8639], a subscription does not move to the
   active state until the GET is received.

3.1.  Transport Connectivity

   For a dynamic subscription, when a RESTCONF session doesn&#x27;t already
   exist, a new RESTCONF session is initiated from the subscriber.

   As stated in Section 2.1 of [RFC8040], a subscriber MUST establish
   the HTTP session over TLS [RFC8446] in order to secure the content in
   transit.

   Without the involvement of additional protocols, HTTP sessions by
   themselves do not support quick recognition of the loss of the
   communication path to the publisher.  Where quick recognition of the
   loss of a publisher is required, a subscriber SHOULD use a TLS
   heartbeat [RFC6520], just from subscriber to publisher, to track HTTP
   session continuity.

   Loss of the heartbeat MUST result in the teardown of any
   subscription-related TCP sessions between those endpoints.  A
   subscriber can then attempt to re-establish the dynamic subscription
   by using the procedure described in Section 3.4.

3.2.  Discovery

   Subscribers can learn which event streams a RESTCONF server supports
   by querying the &quot;streams&quot; container of ietf-subscribed-
   notifications.yang in [RFC8639].  Support for the &quot;streams&quot; container
   of ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang in [RFC8040] is not required.  In
   the case when the RESTCONF binding specified by this document is used
   to convey the &quot;streams&quot; container from ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang
   (i.e., that feature is supported), any event streams contained
   therein are also expected to be present in the &quot;streams&quot; container of
   ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang.

   Subscribers can learn which datastores a RESTCONF server supports by
   following Section 2 of [RFC8527].

3.3.  RESTCONF RPCs and HTTP Status Codes

   Specific HTTP response codes as defined in Section 6 of [RFC7231]
   will indicate the result of RESTCONF RPC requests with the publisher.
   An HTTP status code of 200 is the proper response to any successful
   RPC defined within [RFC8639] or [RFC8641].

   If a publisher fails to serve the RPC request for one of the reasons
   indicated in Section 2.4.6 of [RFC8639] or Appendix A of [RFC8641],
   this will be indicated by an appropriate error code, as shown below,
   transported in the HTTP response.

   When an HTTP error code is returned, the RPC reply MUST include an
   &lt;rpc-error&gt; element per Section 7.1 of [RFC8040] with the following
   parameter values:

   *  an &quot;error-type&quot; node of &quot;application&quot;.

   *  an &quot;error-tag&quot; node whose value is a string that corresponds to an
      identity associated with the error.  This &quot;error-tag&quot; will come
      from one of two places and will correspond to the error identities
      either within Section 2.4.6 of [RFC8639] for general subscription
      errors (Table 1) or within Appendix A.1 of [RFC8641] for
      subscription errors specific to YANG datastores (Table 2).

   *  an &quot;error-app-tag&quot; node whose value is a string that corresponds
      to an identity associated with the error, as defined in
      Section 2.4.6 of [RFC8639] for general subscriptions or
      Appendix A.1 of [RFC8641] for subscription errors specific to YANG
      datastores.  The tag to use depends on the RPC for which the error
      occurred.  Viable errors for different RPCs are found in Table 3.

        +------------------------+--------------------------------+

            Table 3: RPC Errors and Associated Error Identities

   Each error identity will be inserted as the &quot;error-app-tag&quot; using
   JSON encoding following the form &lt;modulename&gt;:&lt;identityname&gt;.  An
   example of such a valid encoding would be &quot;ietf-subscribed-
   notifications:no-such-subscription&quot;.

   In the case of error responses to an &quot;establish-subscription&quot; or
   &quot;modify-subscription&quot; request, there is the option to include an
   &quot;error-info&quot; node.  This node may contain hints for parameter
   settings that might lead to successful RPC requests in the future.
   Tables 4 and 5 show the yang-data structures that may be returned.

      +--------------+---------------------------------------------+
      | Target:      | Return hints in yang-data structure         |
      +==============+=============================================+
      | event stream | establish-subscription-stream-error-info    |
      +--------------+---------------------------------------------+
      | datastore    | establish-subscription-datastore-error-info |
      +--------------+---------------------------------------------+

             Table 4: Optional &quot;error-info&quot; Node Hints for an
                     &quot;establish-subscription&quot; Request

        +--------------+------------------------------------------+
        | Target:      | Returns hints in yang-data structure     |
        +==============+==========================================+
        | event stream | modify-subscription-stream-error-info    |
        +--------------+------------------------------------------+
        | datastore    | modify-subscription-datastore-error-info |
        +--------------+------------------------------------------+

              Table 5: Optional &quot;error-info&quot; Node Hints for an
                       &quot;modify-subscription&quot; Request

   The yang-data included within &quot;error-info&quot; SHOULD NOT include the
   optional leaf &quot;reason&quot;, as such a leaf would be redundant with
   information that is already placed within the &quot;error-app-tag&quot;.

   In case of an &lt;rpc-error&gt; as a result of a &quot;delete-subscription&quot;, a
   &quot;kill-subscription&quot;, or a &quot;resync-subscription&quot; request, no &quot;error-
   info&quot; needs to be included, as the &quot;subscription-id&quot; is the only RPC
   input parameter, and no hints regarding this RPC input parameters
   need to be provided.

   Note that &quot;error-path&quot; [RFC8040] does not need to be included with
   the &lt;rpc-error&gt; element, as subscription errors are generally
   associated with the choice of RPC input parameters.

3.4.  Call Flow for Server-Sent Events

   The call flow for Server-Sent Events (SSE) is defined in Figure 1.
   The logical connections denoted by (a) and (b) can be a TCP
   connection or an HTTP/2 stream (if HTTP/2 is used, multiple HTTP/2
   streams can be carried in one TCP connection).  Requests to RPCs as
   defined in [RFC8639] or [RFC8641] are sent on a connection indicated
   by (a).  A successful &quot;establish-subscription&quot; will result in an RPC
   response returned with both a subscription identifier that uniquely
   identifies a subscription, as well as a URI that uniquely identifies
   the location of subscription on the publisher (b).  This URI is
   defined via the &quot;uri&quot; leaf in the data model in Section 7.

   An HTTP GET is then sent on a separate logical connection (b) to the
   URI on the publisher.  This signals the publisher to initiate the
   flow of notification messages that are sent in SSE [W3C-20150203] as
   a response to the GET.  There cannot be two or more simultaneous GET
   requests on a subscription URI: any GET request received while there
   is a current GET request on the same URI MUST be rejected with HTTP
   error code 409.

   As described in Section 6.4 of [RFC8040], RESTCONF servers SHOULD NOT
   send the &quot;event&quot; or &quot;id&quot; fields in the SSE event notifications.

   +--------------+                             +--------------+

          Figure 1: Dynamic Subscriptions with Server-Sent Events

   Additional requirements for dynamic subscriptions over SSE include:

   *  A publisher MUST return all subscription state notifications in a
      separate SSE message used by the subscription to which the state
      change refers.

   *  Subscription RPCs MUST NOT use the connection currently providing
      notification messages for that subscription.

   *  In addition to an RPC response for a &quot;modify-subscription&quot; RPC
      traveling over (a), a &quot;subscription-modified&quot; state change
      notification MUST be sent within (b).  This allows the receiver to
      know exactly when, within the stream of events, the new terms of
      the subscription have been applied to the notification messages.
      See arrow (c).

   *  In addition to any required access permissions (e.g., Network
      Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)), the RPCs &quot;modify-
      subscription&quot;, &quot;resync-subscription&quot;, and &quot;delete-subscription&quot;
      SHOULD only be allowed by the same RESTCONF username [RFC8040]
      that invoked &quot;establish-subscription&quot;.  Such a restriction
      generally serves to preserve users&#x27; privacy, but exceptions might
      be made for administrators that may need to modify or delete other
      users&#x27; subscriptions.

   *  The &quot;kill-subscription&quot; RPC can be invoked by any RESTCONF
      username with the required administrative permissions.

   A publisher MUST terminate a subscription in the following cases:

   *  Receipt of a &quot;delete-subscription&quot; or a &quot;kill-subscription&quot; RPC
      for that subscription

   *  Loss of TLS heartbeat

   A publisher MAY terminate a subscription at any time as stated in
   Section 1.3 of [RFC8639].

4.  QoS Treatment

   Qos treatment for event streams is described in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC8639].  In addition, if HTTP/2 is used, the publisher MUST:

   *  Take the &quot;weighting&quot; leaf node in [RFC8639] and copy it into the
      HTTP/2 stream weight, Section 5.3 of [RFC7540], and

   *  Take any existing subscription &quot;dependency&quot;, as specified by the
      &quot;dependency&quot; leaf node in [RFC8639], and use the HTTP/2 stream for
      the parent subscription as the HTTP/2 stream dependency (as
      described in Section 5.3.1 of [RFC7540]) of the dependent
      subscription.

   *  Set the exclusive flag (Section 5.3.1 of [RFC7540]) to 0.

   For dynamic subscriptions with the same Differentiated Services Code
   Point (DSCP) value to a specific publisher, it is recommended that
   the subscriber sends all URI GET requests on a common HTTP/2 session
   (if HTTP/2 is used).  Conversely, a subscriber cannot use a common
   HTTP/2 session for subscriptions with different DSCP values.

5.  Notification Messages

   Notification messages transported over RESTCONF will be encoded
   according to [RFC8040], Section 6.4.

6.  YANG Tree

   The YANG module defined in Section 7 has one leaf that augments three
   nodes of [RFC8639].

   module: ietf-restconf-subscribed-notifications
     augment /sn:establish-subscription/sn:output:
       +--ro uri?   inet:uri
     augment /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription:
       +--ro uri?   inet:uri
     augment /sn:subscription-modified:

   This document registers the following namespace URI in the &quot;ns&quot;
   subregistry of the &quot;IETF XML Registry&quot; [RFC3688]:

   URI:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-subscribed-notifications

   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.

   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the &quot;YANG Module
   Names&quot; registry [RFC6020]:

   Name:  ietf-restconf-subscribed-notifications

   Namespace:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-subscribed-notifications

   Prefix:  rsn

   Reference:  RFC 8650

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management transports
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The one new data node introduced in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to this data node.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Container: &quot;/subscriptions&quot;

   *  &quot;uri&quot;: leaf will show where subscribed resources might be located
      on a publisher.  Access control must be set so that only someone
      with proper access permissions, i.e., the same RESTCONF [RFC8040]
      user credentials that invoked the corresponding &quot;establish-
      subscription&quot;, has the ability to access this resource.

   The subscription URI is implementation specific and is encrypted via
   the use of TLS.  Therefore, even if an attacker succeeds in guessing
   the subscription URI, a RESTCONF username [RFC8040] with the required
   administrative permissions must be used to be able to access or
   modify that subscription.  It is recommended that the subscription
   URI values not be easily predictable.

   The access permission considerations for the RPCs &quot;modify-
   subscription&quot;, &quot;resync-subscription&quot;, &quot;delete-subscription&quot;, and
   &quot;kill-subscription&quot; are described in Section 3.4.

   If a buggy or compromised RESTCONF subscriber sends a number of
   &quot;establish-subscription&quot; requests, then these subscriptions
   accumulate and may use up system resources.  In such a situation, the
   publisher MAY also suspend or terminate a subset of the active
   subscriptions from that RESTCONF subscriber in order to reclaim
   resources and preserve normal operation for the other subscriptions.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section is non-normative.  To allow easy comparison, this
   section mirrors the functional examples shown with NETCONF over XML
   within [RFC8640].  In addition, HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 headers are not
   shown as the contents of the JSON encoded objects are identical
   within.

   The subscription URI values used in the examples in this section are
   purely illustrative, and are not indicative of the expected usage
   that is described in Section 9.

   The DSCP values are only for example purposes and are all indicated
   in decimal since the encoding is JSON [RFC7951].

A.1.  Dynamic Subscriptions

A.1.1.  Establishing Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following figure shows two successful &quot;establish-subscription&quot;
   RPC requests as per [RFC8639].  The first request is given a
   subscription identifier of 22, and the second, an identifier of 23.

            Figure 2: Multiple Subscriptions over RESTCONF/HTTP

   To provide examples of the information being transported, example
   messages for interactions in Figure 2 are detailed below:

   POST /restconf/operations
        /ietf-subscribed-notifications:establish-subscription

   {
      &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:input&quot;: {
         &quot;stream-xpath-filter&quot;: &quot;/example-module:foo/&quot;,
         &quot;stream&quot;: &quot;NETCONF&quot;,
         &quot;dscp&quot;: 10
      }
   }

               Figure 3: &quot;establish-subscription&quot; Request (a)

   As the publisher was able to fully satisfy the request, the publisher
   sends the subscription identifier of the accepted subscription and
   the URI:

   HTTP status code - 200

   {
      &quot;id&quot;: 22,
      &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/restconf/subscriptions/22&quot;
   }

   <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-6379'>   Upon receipt of the successful response, the subscriber does a GET to <button id="btn_6379" target="expand_6379" onclick='hideFunction("expand_6379")'>Expand</button>
   the provided URI to start the flow of notification messages.  When
   the publisher receives this, the subscription is moved to the active
   state (c).

   GET /restconf/subscriptions/22

   While not shown in Figure 2, if the publisher had not been able to
   fully satisfy the request, or the subscriber has no authorization to
   establish the subscription, the publisher would have sent an RPC
   error response.  For instance, if the &quot;dscp&quot; value of 10 asserted by
   the subscriber in Figure 3 proved unacceptable, the publisher may
   have returned:

   HTTP status code - 400

           &quot;error-app-tag&quot;:
               &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:dscp-unavailable&quot;
         }
       ]
     }
   }

   The subscriber can use this information in future attempts to
   establish a subscription.

A.1.2.  Modifying Dynamic Subscriptions

   An existing subscription may be modified.  The following exchange
   shows a negotiation of such a modification via several exchanges
   between a subscriber and a publisher.  This negotiation consists of a
   failed RPC modification request/response followed by a successful
   one.

      +------------+                 +-----------+
      | Subscriber |                 | Publisher |
      +------------+                 +-----------+
            |                              |
            |  notification message (id#23)|
            |&lt;-----------------------------|
            |                              |
            |modify-subscription (id#23)   |
            |-----------------------------&gt;|  (d)
            |    HTTP 400 error (with hint)|
            |&lt;-----------------------------|  (e)
            |                              |
            |modify-subscription (id#23)   |
            |-----------------------------&gt;|
            |                  HTTP 200 OK |
            |&lt;-----------------------------|
            |                              |
            |            notif-mesg (id#23)|
            |&lt;-----------------------------|
            |                              |

    Figure 7: Interaction Model for Successful Subscription Modification

   If the subscription being modified in Figure 7 is a datastore
   subscription as per [RFC8641], the modification request made in (d)
   may look like that shown in Figure 8.  As can be seen, the
   modifications being attempted are the application of a new XML Path
   Language (XPath) filter as well as the setting of a new periodic time
   interval.

   POST /restconf/operations
        /ietf-subscribed-notifications:modify-subscription

   {
    &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:input&quot;: {
       &quot;id&quot;: 23,
       &quot;ietf-yang-push:datastore-xpath-filter&quot;:
          &quot;/example-module:foo/example-module:bar&quot;,
       &quot;ietf-yang-push:periodic&quot;: {
          &quot;ietf-yang-push:period&quot;: 500
       }
     }
   }

              Figure 8: Subscription Modification Request (c)

   If the publisher can satisfy both changes, the publisher sends a
   positive result for the RPC.  If the publisher cannot satisfy either
   of the proposed changes, the publisher sends an RPC error response
   (e).  The following is an example RPC error response for (e) that
   includes a hint.  This hint is an alternative time period value that
   might have resulted in a successful modification:

   HTTP status code - 400

   { &quot;ietf-restconf:errors&quot; : {
       &quot;error&quot; : [
         &quot;error-type&quot;: &quot;application&quot;,
         &quot;error-tag&quot;: &quot;invalid-value&quot;,
         &quot;error-severity&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
         &quot;error-app-tag&quot;: &quot;ietf-yang-push:period-unsupported&quot;,
         &quot;error-info&quot;: {
           &quot;ietf-yang-push&quot;:
           &quot;modify-subscription-datastore-error-info&quot;: {
              &quot;period-hint&quot;: 3000
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }

           Figure 9: &quot;modify-subscription&quot; Failure with Hint (e)

A.1.3.  Deleting Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following demonstrates deleting a subscription.  This
   subscription may have been to either a stream or a datastore.

   POST /restconf/operations
        /ietf-subscribed-notifications:delete-subscription

   {
    &quot;delete-subscription&quot;: {
       &quot;id&quot;: &quot;22&quot;
    }
   }

                  Figure 10: &quot;delete-subscription&quot; Request

   If the publisher can satisfy the request, the publisher replies with
   success to the RPC request.

   If the publisher cannot satisfy the request, the publisher sends an
   &lt;rpc-error&gt; element indicating the modification didn&#x27;t work.
   Figure 11 shows a valid response for an existing valid subscription
   identifier, but that subscription identifier was created on a
   different transport session:

   HTTP status code - 404

   {
     &quot;ietf-restconf:errors&quot; : {
       &quot;error&quot; : [
         &quot;error-type&quot;: &quot;application&quot;,
         &quot;error-tag&quot;: &quot;invalid-value&quot;,
         &quot;error-severity&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
         &quot;error-app-tag&quot;:
            &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:no-such-subscription&quot;
       ]
     }
   }

               Figure 11: Unsuccessful &quot;delete-subscription&quot;

A.2.  Subscription State Notifications

   A publisher will send subscription state notifications according to
   the definitions within [RFC8639].

A.2.1.  &quot;subscription-modified&quot;

   A &quot;subscription-modified&quot; encoded in JSON would look like:

   {
     &quot;ietf-restconf:notification&quot; : {
       &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;2007-09-01T10:00:00Z&quot;,
       &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:subscription-modified&quot;: {
         &quot;id&quot;: 39,
         &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/restconf/subscriptions/22&quot;
         &quot;stream-xpath-filter&quot;: &quot;/example-module:foo&quot;,
         &quot;stream&quot;: {
            &quot;ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications&quot; : &quot;NETCONF&quot;
         }
       }
     }
   }

     Figure 12: &quot;subscription-modified&quot; Subscription State Notification

A.2.2.  &quot;subscription-completed&quot;, &quot;subscription-resumed&quot;, and &quot;replay-
        completed&quot;

   A &quot;subscription-completed&quot; notification would look like:

   {
     &quot;ietf-restconf:notification&quot; : {
       &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;2007-09-01T10:00:00Z&quot;,
       &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:subscription-completed&quot;: {
         &quot;id&quot;: 39,
       }
     }
   }

          Figure 13: &quot;subscription-completed&quot; Notification in JSON

   The &quot;subscription-resumed&quot; and &quot;replay-complete&quot; are virtually
   identical, with &quot;subscription-completed&quot; simply being replaced by
   &quot;subscription-resumed&quot; and &quot;replay-complete&quot;.

A.2.3.  &quot;subscription-terminated&quot; and &quot;subscription-suspended&quot;

   A &quot;subscription-terminated&quot; would look like:

   {
     &quot;ietf-restconf:notification&quot; : {
       &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;2007-09-01T10:00:00Z&quot;,
       &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:subscription-terminated&quot;: {
         &quot;id&quot;: 39,
         &quot;error-id&quot;: &quot;suspension-timeout&quot;
       }
     }
   }

    Figure 14: &quot;subscription-terminated&quot; Subscription State Notification

   The &quot;subscription-suspended&quot; is virtually identical, with
   &quot;subscription-terminated&quot; simply being replaced by &quot;subscription-
   suspended&quot;.

A.3.  Filter Example

   This section provides an example that illustrates the method of
   filtering event record contents.  The example is based on the YANG
   notification &quot;vrrp-protocol-error-event&quot; as defined per the ietf-
   vrrp.yang module within [RFC8347].  Event records based on this
   specification that are generated by the publisher might appear as:

   data: {
   data:   &quot;ietf-restconf:notification&quot; : {
   data:     &quot;eventTime&quot; : &quot;2018-09-14T08:22:33.44Z&quot;,
   data:     &quot;ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event&quot; : {
   data:       &quot;protocol-error-reason&quot; : &quot;checksum-error&quot;
   data:     }
   data:   }
   data: }

             Figure 15: RFC 8347 (VRRP) - Example Notification

   Suppose a subscriber wanted to establish a subscription that only
   passes instances of event records where there is a &quot;checksum-error&quot;
   as part of a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) protocol
   event.  Also assume the publisher places such event records into the
   NETCONF stream.  To get a continuous series of matching event
   records, the subscriber might request the application of an XPath
   filter against the NETCONF stream.  An &quot;establish-subscription&quot; RPC
   to meet this objective might be:

   POST /restconf/operations
        /ietf-subscribed-notifications:establish-subscription
   {
      &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:input&quot;: {
         &quot;stream&quot;: &quot;NETCONF&quot;,
         &quot;stream-xpath-filter&quot;:
           &quot;/ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event[
             protocol-error-reason=&#x27;checksum-error&#x27;]/&quot;,
      }
   }

       Figure 16: Establishing a Subscription Error Reason via XPath

   For more examples of XPath filters, see [XPATH].

   Suppose the &quot;establish-subscription&quot; in Figure 16 was accepted.  And
   suppose later a subscriber decided they wanted to broaden this
   subscription cover to all VRRP protocol events (i.e., not just those
   with a &quot;checksum error&quot;).  The subscriber might attempt to modify the
   subscription in a way that replaces the XPath filter with a subtree
   filter that sends all VRRP protocol events to a subscriber.  Such a
   &quot;modify-subscription&quot; RPC might look like:

   POST /restconf/operations
        /ietf-subscribed-notifications:modify-subscription
   {
      &quot;ietf-subscribed-notifications:input&quot;: {
         &quot;stream&quot;: &quot;NETCONF&quot;,
         &quot;stream-subtree-filter&quot;: {
           &quot;/ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event&quot; : {}
         }
      }
   }

                Figure 17: Example &quot;modify-subscription&quot; RPC

   For more examples of subtree filters, see [RFC6241], Section 6.4.
