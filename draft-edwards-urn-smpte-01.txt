Internet-Draft            SMPTE URN Definition             February 2007


1.  Introduction

   SMPTE (the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) is an
   internationally-recognized standards developing organization.
   Headquartered and incorporated in the United States of America, SMPTE
   has members in over 80 countries on six continents.  SMPTE's
   Engineering Documents, including Standards, Recommended Practices and
   Engineering Guidelines, are prepared by SMPTE's Technology
   Committees.  Participation in these Committees is open to all with a
   bona fide interest in their work.  SMPTE cooperates closely with
   other standards-developing organizations, including ISO, IEC and ITU.
   Also, the SMPTE Registration Authority maintains a registry of
   Universal Labels (ULs) used in identifying the type and encoding of
   data within data streams associated with audio-visual material.

   SMPTE would like to assign unique, permanent, and location-
   independent names using URNs for resources that SMPTE produces or
   manages.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.


2.  URN Namespace Definition Template

   The following template is provided in accordance with [RFC3406].

      Namespace ID:

         smpte

      Registration Information:

         Version: 1

         Date: 2007 2 9

      Declared registrant of the namespace:

         Organization: Society of Motion Picture and Television
         Engineers

         Contact: Director of Engineering

         Address: 3 Barker Avenue - 5th Floor

         Phone: +1 (914) 761-1100

         Email: standards@smpte.org

      Declaration of structure:

         The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
         "smpte" NID shall be conformant to the URN syntax requirements
         defined in [RFC2141].

         URNs for the "urn:smpte" namespace shall follow the structure
         defined in [SMPTE2029].

         SMPTE (or it successor) may add additional subnamespaces in the
         future.  Any system which deals with URNs for the "urn:smpte"
         namespace should be written with the awareness that this could
         occur at any time.

         For informative purposes, the identifier structure described
         using ABNF (according to [RFC4234]) is as follows:

            ;start ABNF notation

            URN = "urn:" NID NSS

            NID = "smpte:"

            NSS = UL-NSS / other-NSS

            UL-NSS = "ul:" UL

            UL = QUADBYTE *(DOT QUADBYTE)

            DOT = %x2E ; period

            QUADBYTE = 4BYTE

            BYTE = 2HEXDIG

            other-NSS = 1*(DIGIT / ALPHA / "-"/":")

            ; other-NSS which conforms with [RFC2141] for future
            expansion

            ;end ABNF notation

      Relevant ancillary documentation:

         The structure for URNs in the "urn:smpte" namespace are defined
         in [SMPTE2029].

         The values of ULs in the "urn:smpte:ul" subnamespace shall be
         constrained as defined in [SMPTE298M].  Details regarding the
         use of ULs as keys in key-length-value (KLV) coding including
         how to determine in which SMPTE registry a SMPTE-administered
         UL may be found are described in [SMPTE336M].

      Identifier uniqueness considerations:

         The rules for assignment of SMPTE-administered ULs requires
         that each UL be unique to the UL space and that it cannot be
         reassigned or reused.

         It should be noted that [SMPTE298M] states that "A universal
         label shall be an 'object identifier' as specified by ISO/IEC
         8824-1," although the SMPTE Universal Label representation is a
         specialized one that carries additional semantics over the OID
         representation of URN OID ([RFC3001]).

         SMPTE will work to ensure that all current and future
         "urn:smpte" subnamespaces contain unique identifiers.

      Identifier persistence considerations:

         SMPTE-administered ULs may occasionally be deleted through
         SMPTE procedures.  Regardless, even after a UL has been
         deleted, it will not be reused.  Revisions to ULs will result
         in the creation of a new UL, and the deletion of the old one.

         The persistence of URNs in future "urn:smpte" subnamespaces
         will be defined by SMPTE Standards.

      Process of identifier assignment:

         Assignment of URNs in the SMPTE NID is limited to SMPTE and
         those authorities that are specifically designated by SMPTE.
         SMPTE may designate portions of its namespace for assignment by
         other parties.

         Due process is followed by committees in the development of
         SMPTE documents.  Some types of Universal Label registrations,
         and other registrations may require a fee to be paid to SMPTE.

         All classes of SMPTE-administered ULs require for registration
         the name and address of the applicant.  Some classes of labels
         also require the submission of supporting technical
         documentation for the label and may require a due process
         evaluation through the SMPTE Engineering Committee process.

      Process for identifier resolution:

         SMPTE-administered ULs are resolved through publications of the
         SMPTE Registration Authority.  Currently, publication of SMPTE-
         administered ULs are made through a Metadata Dictionary as
         specified in [RP210] and through the SMPTE Labels Registry as
         specified in [RP224], both of which are currently available
         online at http://www.smpte-ra.org/mdd/.

         SMPTE expects to develop and maintain "URN catalogs" that map
         all future assigned URNs in the "urn:smpte" namespace to
         Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to enable Web-based resolution
         of named resources.

      Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

         Lexical equivalence of URNs in the "urn:smpte:ul" subnamespace
         is achieved by a exact string match which is case-insensitive
         for alphabetical characters.

      Conformance with URN Syntax:

         No special considerations beyond the syntax herein described.

      Validation mechanism:

         None.

      Scope: Global.


3.  Examples

   Currently only a "urn:smpte:ul" subnamespace is defined.  This is the
   subnamespace for SMPTE Universal Labels [SMPTE298M].  SMPTE may add
   additional subnamespaces in the future.

   The following examples are not guaranteed to be real, and are

   provided for illustrative purposes only.

      urn:smpte:ul:060E2B34.04010103.04010202.01011100

      urn:smpte:newnss:future-urn-2105


4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.


5.  Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations

   SMPTE is an internationally-recognized standards developing
   organization.  As part of this effort, SMPTE also registers items
   such as Universal Labels through the SMPTE Registration Authority.
   The SMPTE namespace provides a uniform, unique, and effective way to
   communicate resource names for these items, which can be used by the
   motion imaging industry community.  This namespace is also intended
   to be a useful mechanism to provide both human and automated access
   to these resources through online systems.

   The individual URNs in the namespace shall be assigned through the
   process of development of documents by SMPTE, through definition by
   SMPTE standards, or through the registration of Universal Labels or
   other items by the SMPTE Registration Authority.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration that is to be entered
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.  It specifically requests the
   NID, "smpte".


7.  SMPTE Registration Authority (Informative)

   The URL of the SMPTE Registration Authority is
   http://www.smpte-ra.org.
