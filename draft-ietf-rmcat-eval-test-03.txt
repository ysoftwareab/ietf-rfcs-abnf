Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
   multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
   required to implement congestion control.  This document describes
   the test cases to be used in the performance evaluation of such
   congestion control algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating congestion
   control algorithm proposals for real-time interactive media.  It is
   based on the guidelines enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria]
   and the requirements discussed in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].
   The test cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a
   common structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added
   to those described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the
   modeling of different path characteristics.  The described test cases

   in this memo SHOULD be used to evaluate any proposed congestion
   control algorithm for real-time interactive media.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550], RTP Profile for Audio and
   Video Conferences with Minimal Control [RFC3551], RTCP Extended
   Report (XR) [RFC3611], Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585], and Support for Reduced-Size RTCP [RFC5506]
   apply.

3.  Structure of Test cases

   All the test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
   implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
   explaining common attributes.  The structure includes a general
   description section that describes the test case and its motivation.
   Additionally the test case defines a set of attributes that
   characterize the testbed, for example, the network path between
   communicating peers and the diverse traffic sources.

   o  Define the test case:

      *  General description: describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.

      *  Expected behavior: describes the desired rate adaptation
         behavior.

      *  Define a list of metrics to evaluate the desired behavior: this
         indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link utilization,
         media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs to measure
         to validate the expected rate adaptation behavior.  It should
         also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over 10ms,
         100ms, or 1s) for measuring certain metrics.  Typical
         measurement interval is 200ms.

   o  Define testbed topology: every test case needs to define an
      evaluation testbed topology.  Figure 1 shows such an evaluation
      topology.  In this evaluation topology, S1..Sn are traffic
      sources.  These sources generate media traffic and use either
      congestion control algorithm under investigation.  R1..Rn are the
      corresponding receivers.  A test case can have one or more such
      traffic sources (S) and their corresponding receivers (R).  The
      path from the source to destination is denoted as "forward" and
      the path from a destination to a source is denoted as "backward".
      The following basic structure of the test case has been described
      from the perspective of media generating endpoints attached on the

      left-hand side of Figure 1.  In this setup, the media flows are
      transported in forward direction and corresponding feedback/
      control messages are transported in the backward direction.
      However, it is also possible to set up the test with media in both
      forward and backward directions.  In that case, unless otherwise
      specified by the test case, it is expected that the backward path
      does not introduce any congestion related impairments and has
      enough capacity to accommodate both media and feedback/control
      messages.  It should be noted that depending on the test cases it
      is possible to have different path characteristics in either of
      the directions.

                  Figure 1: Example of A Testbed Topology

      In a testbed environment where real equipments are used to create
      a laboratory, there may exist a significant amount of traffic on
      portions of the network path between the endpoints that is not
      desired for the purposes of the tests described in the document.
      Some of this traffic may be generated by other processes on the
      endpoints themselves (e.g., discovery protocols) or by other
      endpoints not presently under test.  It is recommended not to
      route traffic generated by endpoints that are not under test
      through the test bed and route those traffic generated by the
      endpoints under test around the bottleneck links specified herein.

   o  Define testbed attributes:

      *  Duration: defines the duration of the test in seconds.

      *  Path characteristics: defines the end-to-end transport level
         path characteristics of the testbed for a particular test case.
         Two sets of attributes describe the path characteristics, one
         for the forward path and the other for the backward path.  The
         path characteristics for a particular path direction is

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT              March 2016


         applicable to all the Sources "S" sending traffic on that path.
         If only one attribute is specified, it is used for both path
         directions, however, unless specified the reverse path has no
         capacity restrictions and no path loss.

         +  Path direction: forward or backward.

         +  Bottleneck-link capacity: defines minimum capacity of the
            end-to-end path

         +  Reference bottleneck capacity: defines a reference value for
            the bottleneck capacity for test cases with time-varying
            bottleneck capacities.  All bottleneck capacities will be
            specified as a ratio with respect to the reference capacity
            value.

         +  One-way propagation delay: describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path when network queues are empty, i.e., the time
            it takes for a packet to go from the sender to the receiver
            without encountering any queuing delay.

         +  Maximum end-to-end jitter: defines the maximum jitter that
            can be observed along the path.

         +  Bottleneck queue type: for example, Droptail, FQ-CoDel, or
            PIE.

         +  Bottleneck queue size: defines the size of queue in terms of
            queuing time when the queue is full (in milliseconds).

         +  Path loss ratio: characterizes the non-congested, additive,
            losses to be generated on the end-to-end path.  MUST
            describe the loss pattern or loss model used to generate the
            losses.

      *  Application-related: defines the traffic source behavior for
         implementing the test case

         +  Media traffic Source: defines the characteristics of the
            media sources.  When using more than one media source, the
            different attributes are enumerated separately for each
            different media source.

            -  Media type: Video/Voice

            -  Media flow direction: forward, backward or both.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT              March 2016


            -  Number of media sources: defines the total number of
               media sources

            -  Media codec: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or Variable Bit Rate
               (VBR)

            -  Media source behavior: describes the media encoder
               behavior.  It defines the main parameters that affect the
               adaptation behavior.  This may include but is not limited
               to:

               o  Adaptability: describes the adaptation options.  For
                  example, in the case of video it defines the following
                  ranges of adaptation: bit rate, frame rate, video
                  resolution.  Similarly, in the case of voice, it
                  defines the range of bit rate adaptation, the sampling
                  rate variation, and the variation in packetization
                  interval.

               o  Output variation : for a VBR encoder it defines the
                  encoder output variation from the average target rate
                  over a particular measurement interval.  For example,
                  on average the encoder output may vary between 5% to
                  15% above or below the average target bit rate when
                  measured over a 100 ms time window.  The time interval
                  over which the variation is specified must be
                  provided.

               o  Responsiveness to a new bit rate request: the lag in
                  time between a new bit rate request from the
                  congestion control algorithm and actual rate changes
                  in encoder output.  Depending on the encoder, this
                  value may be specified in absolute time (e.g. 10ms to
                  1000ms) or other appropriate metric (e.g. next frame
                  interval time).

               More detailed discussions on expected media source
               behavior, including those from synthetic video traffic
               sources, is at [I-D.ietf-rmcat-video-traffic-model].

            -  Media content: describes the chosen media sequences; For
               example, test sequences are available at: [xiph-seq] and
               [HEVC-seq].

            -  Media timeline: describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the testbed.  For example,
               the media source may start transmitting immediately when
               the test case begins, or after a few seconds.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT              March 2016


            -  Startup behavior: the media starts at a defined bit rate,
               which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a value in
               between (in Kbps).

         +  Competing traffic source: describes the characteristics of
            the competing traffic source, the different types of
            competing flows are enumerated in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

            -  Traffic direction: forward, backward or both.

            -  Type of sources: defines the types of competing traffic
               sources.  Types of competing traffic flows are listed in
               [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  For example, the number
               of TCP flows connected to a web browser, the mean size
               and distribution of the content downloaded.

            -  Number of sources: defines the total number of competing
               sources of each media type per traffic direction.

            -  Congestion control: enumerates the congestion control
               used by each type of competing traffic.

            -  Traffic timeline: describes when the competing traffic
               starts and ends in the test case.

      *  Additional attributes: describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case which are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes MUST be well defined, so that the
         other implementers of that particular test case are able to
         implement it easily.

   Any attribute can have a set of values (enclosed within "[]").  Each
   member value of such a set MUST be treated as different value for the
   same attribute.  It is desired to run separate tests for each such
   attribute value.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

4.  Recommended Evaluation Settings

   This section describes recommended test case settings and could be
   overwritten by the respective test cases.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT              March 2016


4.1.  Evaluation metrics

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms the
   implementers MUST log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       A.  End-to-end delay for the congestion controlled media flow.

       B.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       C.  Packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       D.  Feedback message overhead.

       E.  Convergence time - time to reach steady state for the
           congestion controlled media flow(s).

   2.  Transport level:

       A.  Bandwidth utilization.

       B.  Queue length (milliseconds at specified path capacity):

           +  average over the length of the session.

           +  5 and 95 percentile.

           +  median, maximum, minimum.

4.2.  Path characteristics

   Each path between a sender and receiver as described in Figure 1 have
   the following characteristics unless otherwise specified in the test
   case.

   o  Path direction: forward and backward.

   o  Reference bottleneck capacity: 1Mbps.

   o  One-Way propagation delay: 50ms.  Implementers are encouraged to
      run the experiment with additional propagation delays mentioned in
      [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria]

   o  Maximum end-to-end jitter: 30ms.  Jitter models are described in
      [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria]



Sarker, et al.          Expires September 9, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT              March 2016


   o  Bottleneck queue type: Drop tail.  Implementers are encouraged to
      run the experiment with other AQM schemes, such as FQ-CoDel and
      PIE.

   o  Bottleneck queue size: 300ms.

   o  Path loss ratio: 0%.

   Examples of additional network parameters are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

   For test cases involving time-varying bottleneck capacity, all
   capacity values are specified as a ratio with respect to a reference
   capacity value, so as to allow flexible scaling of capacity values
   along with media source rate range.  There exist two different
   mechanisms for inducing path capacity variation: a) by explicitly
   modifying the value of physical link capacity; or b) by introducing
   background non-adaptive UDP traffic with time-varying traffic rate.
   Implementers are encouraged to run the experiments with both
   mechanisms for test cases specified in Section 5.1, Section 5.2, and
   Section 5.3.

4.3.  Media source

   Unless otherwise specified, each test case will include one or more
   media sources as described below.

   o  Media type: Video

      *  Media codec: VBR

            -  Bit rate range: 150 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps.  In real-life
               applications the bit rate range can vary a lot depending
               on the provided service, for example, the maximum bit
               rate can be up to 4Mbps.  However, for running tests to
               evaluate the congestion control algorithms it is more
               important to have a look at how they are reacting to
               certain amount of bandwidth change.  Also it is possible
               that the media traffic generator used in a particular
               simulator or testbed is not capable of generating higher
               bit rate.  Hence we have selected a suitable bit rate
               range typical of consumer-grade video conferencing
               applications in designing the test case.  If a different
               bit rate range is used in the test cases, then the end-

5.  Basic Test Cases

5.1.  Variable Available Capacity with a Single Flow

   In this test case the bottleneck-link capacity between the two
   endpoints varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  This test tries to
   address the requirements in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements], which
   requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower end-to-
   end latency when there exists:

   o  an intermediate bottleneck

   o  change in available capacity (e.g., due to interface change,
      routing change, abrupt arrival/departure of background non-
      adaptive traffic).

   o  maximum media bit rate is greater than link capacity.  In this
      case, the application will attempt to ramp up to its maximum bit
      rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
      congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
      rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.

   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capacity due
   to any of the above depends on the underlying technologies.  Hence,
   we describe a set of known factors, which may be extended to devise a
   more specific test case targeting certain behaviors in a certain
   network environment.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   path capacity constraint, converges to the bottleneck link's capacity
   and adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the sending bit
   rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity.  The oscillations
   occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate
   but overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity then to
   rectify, it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.

   Evaluation metrics : as described in Section 4.1.

   Testbed topology: One media source S1 is connected to the
   corresponding R1.  The media traffic is transported over the forward
   path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over
   the backward path.

5.2.  Variable Available Capacity with Multiple Flows

   This test case is similar to Section 5.1.  However in addition this
   test will also consider persistent network load due to competing
   traffic.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   variation in available capacity and adapt the media stream(s)
   accordingly.  The flows stabilize around their maximum bit rate as
   the maximum link capacity is large enough to accommodate the flows.
   When the available capacity drops, the flows adapt by decreasing
   their sending bit rate, and when congestion disappears, the flows are
   again expected to ramp up.

   Evaluation metrics : as described in Section 4.1.

   Testbed Topology: Two (2) media sources S1 and S2 are connected to
   their corresponding destinations R1 and R2.  The media traffic is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.

5.3.  Congested Feedback Link with Bi-directional Media Flows

   Real-time interactive media uses RTP hence it is assumed that RTCP,
   RTP header extension or such would be used by the congestion control
   algorithm in the backchannel.  Due to asymmetric nature of the link
   between communicating peers it is possible for a participating peer
   to not receive such feedback information due to an impaired or
   congested backchannel (even when the forward channel might not be
   impaired).  This test case is designed to observe the candidate
   congestion control behavior in such an event.

   It is expected that the candidate algorithms are able to cope with
   the lack of feedback information and adapt to minimize the
   performance degradation of media flows in the forward channel.

   It should be noted that for this test case: logs are compared with
   the reference case, i.e, when the backward channel has no
   impairments.

5.4.  Competing Media Flows with same Congestion Control Algorithm

   In this test case, more than one media flows share the bottleneck
   link and each of them uses the same congestion control algorithm.
   This is a typical scenario where a real-time interactive application
   sends more than one media flow to the same destination and these
   flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In such a scenario it is
   likely that the flows will be routed via the same path and need to
   share the available bandwidth amongst themselves.  For the sake of
   simplicity it is assumed that there are no other competing traffic
   sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity
   to accommodate all the flows individually.  While this appears to be
   a variant of the test case defined in Section 5.2, it focuses on the
   capacity sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm.  The previous
   test case, on the other hand, measures adaptability, stability, and
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.

   Expected behavior: It is expected that the competing flows will
   converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
   minimum possible latency and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces
   three media flows at different time instances, when the second flow
   appears there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
   bottleneck link.  Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck
   link should be saturated.

   Evaluation metrics : as described in Section 4.1.

   Testbed topology: Three media sources S1, S2, S3 are connected to R1,
   R2, R3 respectively.  The media traffic is transported over the
   forward path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is
   transported over the backward path.

5.5.  Round Trip Time Fairness

   In this test case, multiple media flows share the bottleneck link,
   but the end-to-end path latency for each flow is different.  For the
   sake of simplicity it is assumed that there are no other competing
   traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient
   capacity to accommodate all the flows.  While this appears to be a
   variant of test case 5.2, it focuses on the capacity sharing aspect
   of the candidate algorithm under different RTTs.

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to bit rates to
   accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency and loss.
   Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the same time
   instance.

   Evaluation metrics : as described in Section 4.1.

   Testbed Topology: Five (5) media sources S1,S2,..,S5 are connected to
   their corresponding media sinks R1,R2,..,R5.  The media traffic is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.  The topology is the
   same as in Section 5.4.  The end-to-end path delays are: 10ms for
   S1-R1, 25ms for S2-R2, 50ms for S3-R3, 100ms for S4-R4, and 150ms
   S5-R5, respectively.

5.6.  Media Flow Competing with a Long TCP Flow

   In this test case, one or more media flows share the bottleneck link
   with at least one long lived TCP flow.  Long lived TCP flows download
   data throughout the session and are expected to have infinite amount
   of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario where a multimedia
   application co-exists with a large file download.  The test case
   measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to competing
   traffic.  It addresses the requirement 3 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: depending on the convergence observed in test case
   5.1 and 5.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion
   collapse.  In the worst case, the media stream will fall to the
   minimum media bit rate.

   Evaluation metrics : following metrics in addition to as described in
   Section 4.1.

   1.  Flow level:

       A.  TCP throughput.

       B.  Loss for the TCP flow

   Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to the
   corresponding media sink, R1.  In addition, there is a long-live TCP
   flow sharing the same bottleneck link.  The media traffic is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.  The TCP traffic goes
   over the forward path from, S_tcp with acknowledgment packets go over
   the backward path from, R_tcp.

5.7.  Media Flow Competing with Short TCP Flows

   In this test case, one or more congestion controlled media flow
   shares the bottleneck link with multiple short-lived TCP flows.
   Short-lived TCP flows resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web
   traffic, wherein clients (browsers) connect to a server and download
   a resource (typically a web page, few images, text files, etc.) using
   several TCP connections (up to 4).  This scenario shows the
   performance of a multimedia application when several browser windows
   are active.  The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate
   algorithm to competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 1.E
   in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic either
   appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow.  The
   intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst
   on the behavior of the candidate algorithm.

   Evaluation metrics : following metrics in addition to as described in
   Section 4.1.

            the same time, 2 of them start in the ON state while rest on
            the 8 flows start in an OFF stats.  The model for the idle
            times for the OFF state is discussed in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

         +  File sizes: uniform distribution between 100KB to 1MB

         +  Idle period: the duration of the OFF state is derived from
            an exponential distribution with the mean value of 10
            seconds.

5.8.  Media Pause and Resume

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
   share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way.  At this stage one of
   the media flows is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows as they are on a
   shared link.  When the paused media flow resumes it would no longer
   have the same bandwidth share on the link.  It has to make it's way
   through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair share
   of the link capacity.  This test case is important specially for
   real-time interactive media which consists of more than one media
   flows and can pause/resume media flows at any point of time during
   the session.  This test case directly addresses the requirement
   number 5 in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  One can think it as a
   variation of test case defined in Section 5.4.  However, it is
   different as the candidate algorithms can use different strategies to
   increase its efficiency, for example in terms of fairness,
   convergence time, reduce oscillation etc, by capitalizing the fact
   that they have previous information of the link.

6.  Other potential test cases

   It has been noticed that there are other interesting test cases
   besides the basic test cases listed above.  In many aspects, these
   additional test cases can help further evaluation of the candidate
   algorithm.  They are listed as below.

6.1.  Media Flows with Priority

   In this test case media flows will have different priority levels.
   This will be an extension of Section 5.4 where the same test will be
   run with different priority levels imposed on each of the media
   flows.  For example, the first flow (S1) is assigned a priority of 2
   whereas the remaining two flows (S2 and S3) are assigned a priority
   of 1.  The candidate algorithm MUST reflect the relative priorities
   assigned to each media flow.  In the previous example, the first flow
   (S1) MUST arrive at a steady-state rate approximately twice of that
   of the other two flows (S2 and S3).

   The candidate algorithm can use a coupled congestion control
   mechanism for the bandwidth distribution according to the respective
   media flow priority.

6.2.  Explicit Congestion Notification Usage

   This test case requires to run all the basic test cases with the
   availability of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC6679]
   feature enabled.  The goal of this test is to exhibit that the
   candidate algorithms do not fail when ECN signals are available.
   With ECN signals enabled the algorithms are expected to perform
   better than their delay based variants.

6.3.  Multiple Bottlenecks

   In this test case one congestion controlled media flow, S1->R2,
   traverses a path with multiple bottlenecks.  As illustrated in
   Figure 7, the first flow (S1->R1) competes with the second congestion
   controlled media flow (S2->R2) over the link between A and B which is
   close to the sender side; again, that flow (S1->R1) competes with the
   third congestion controlled media flow (S3->R3) over the link between
   C and D which is close to the receiver side.  The goal of this test
   is to ensure that the candidate algorithms work properly in the
   presence of multiple bottleneck links on the end to end path.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT              March 2016


   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to achieve
   full utilization at both bottleneck links without starving any of the
   three congestion controlled media flows.

            Figure 7: Testbed Topology for Multiple Bottlenecks

   Testbed topology: Three media sources S1, S2, and S3 are connected to
   respective destinations R1, R2, and R3.  For all three flows the
   media traffic is transported over the forward path and corresponding
   feedback/control traffic is transported over the backward path.

   Testbed attributes:

   o  Test duration: 300s

   o  Path characteristics:

      *  Reference bottleneck capacity: 2Mbps.

      *  Path capacity ratio between A and B: 1.0

      *  Path capacity ratio between B and C: 4.0.

      *  Path capacity ratio between C and D: 0.75.
