1.  Introduction

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] provides a framework for authentication and message
   protection services through a common programming interface.

   The Simple Anonymous mechanism described in this document (hereafter
   SAnon) is a simple protocol based on the X25519 elliptic curve
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme defined in [RFC7748].  No
   authentication of initiator or acceptor is provided.  A potential use
   of SAnon is to provide a degree of privacy when bootstrapping unkeyed
   entities.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           SAnon GSS-API Mechanism              April 2020


3.  Discovery and Negotiation

   The SAnon mechanism is identified by the following OID:

       sanon-x25519 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
           {iso(1)identified-organization(3)dod(6)internet(1)
            private(4)enterprise(1)padl(5322)gss-sanon(26)
            mechanisms(1)sanon-x25519(110)}

   The means of discovering GSS-API peers and their supported mechanisms
   is out of this specification's scope.  To avoid multiple layers of
   negotiation, SAnon is not crypto-agile.  A future variant using a
   different key exchange algorithm would be assigned a different OID.

   If anonymity is not desired then SAnon MUST NOT be used.  Either
   party can test for the presence of GSS_C_ANON_FLAG to check if
   anonymous authentication was performed.

4.  Naming

4.1.  Name Types

   The SAnon mechanism can import a variety of name types.  A SAnon
   mechanism name is logically a boolean indicating whether it
   represents an anonymous identity.  The following table indicates
   which names represent anonymous identities (the GSS_C_NT_ prefix is
   omitted for space):

   +--------------------+-----------------------------------------+----+
   | Name type          | Name string                             | AI |
   +--------------------+-----------------------------------------+----+
   | USER_NAME          | WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS@WELLKNOWN:ANONYMOUS | Y  |
   |                    |                                         |    |
   | HOSTBASED_SERVICE  | WELLKNOWN@ANONYMOUS                     | Y  |
   |                    |                                         |    |
   | ANONYMOUS          | Any name string                         | Y  |
   |                    |                                         |    |
   | Any other name     | Any name string                         | N  |
   | type               |                                         |    |
   +--------------------+-----------------------------------------+----+

   Inferring an anonymous identity from a well known name permits
   applications that do not support GSS_C_ANON_FLAG or
   GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS, but which permit user-entered names, to use
   SAnon.

4.2.  Canonicalization

   The canonical form of a SAnon mechanism name is the boolean
   indicating whether it represents an anonymous identity.  When
   GSS_Display_name() is called on a canonical name, the display string
   is WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS@WELLKNOWN:ANONYMOUS [RFC8062] and the name
   type is GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS.  This anonymous identity is always the
   name observed by a SAnon peer; all context APIs that return peer
   names MUST return this name for both parties if the context is
   established upon return.

4.3.  Exported Name Format

   SAnon uses the mechanism-independent exported name object format
   defined in [RFC2743] Section 3.2.  All lengths are encoded as big-
   endian integers.  The export and import of non-anonymous mechanism
   names MUST fail with GSS_S_BAD_NAME.

     +--------------+--------------+---------------------------------+
     | Length       | Name         | Description                     |
     +--------------+--------------+---------------------------------+
     | 2            | TOK_ID       | 04 01                           |
     |              |              |                                 |
     | 2            | MECH_OID_LEN | Length of the mechanism OID     |
     |              |              |                                 |
     | MECH_OID_LEN | MECH_OID     | The SAnon mechanism OID, in DER |
     |              |              |                                 |
     | 4            | NAME_LEN     | 00 00 00 01                     |
     |              |              |                                 |
     | 1            | IS_ANONYMOUS | TRUE                            |

5.  Definitions and Token Formats

5.1.  Context Establishment Tokens

5.1.1.  Initial context token

   The initial context token is framed per Section 1 of [RFC2743]:

Internet-Draft           SAnon GSS-API Mechanism              April 2020


   GSS-API DEFINITIONS ::=
       BEGIN

       MechType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER -- 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.26.1.110
       GSSAPI-Token ::=
       [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
            thisMech MechType,
            innerToken ANY DEFINED BY thisMech
                -- 32 byte initiator public key
       }
       END

   On the first call to GSS_Init_sec_context(), the mechanism checks for
   one of the following:

      The caller set anon_req_flag (GSS_C_ANON_FLAG)

      The claimant_cred_handle identity is anonymous (see Section 4.1)

      The claimant_cred_handle is the default credential and targ_name
      is anonymous

   If none of the above are the case, the call MUST fail with
   GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE.

   If proceeding, the initiator generates a fresh secret and public key
   pair per [RFC7748] Section 6.1 and returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED,
   indicating that a subsequent context token from the acceptor is
   expected.  The innerToken field of the output_token contains the
   initiator's 32 byte public key.

5.1.2.  Acceptor context token

   Upon receiving a context token from the initiator, the acceptor
   validates that the token is well formed and contains a public key of
   the requisite length.  The acceptor generates a fresh secret and
   public key pair.  The context session key is computed as specified in
   Section 6.

   The acceptor constructs an output_token by concatenating its public
   key with the token emitted by calling GSS_GetMIC() with the default
   QOP and zero-length octet string.  The output token is sent to the
   initiator without additional framing.

   The acceptor then returns GSS_S_COMPLETE, setting src_name to the
   canonical anonymous name.  The reply_det_state (GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG),
   sequence_state (GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG), conf_avail (GSS_C_CONF_FLAG),

   integ_avail (GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) and anon_state (GSS_C_ANON_FLAG)
   security context flags are set to TRUE.  The context is ready to use.

5.1.3.  Initiator context completion

   Upon receiving the acceptor context token and verifying it is well
   formed, the initiator extracts the acceptor's public key (being the
   first 32 bytes of the input token) and computes the context session
   key per Section 6.

   The initiator calls GSS_VerifyMIC() with the MIC extracted from the
   context token and the zero-length octet string.  If successful, the
   initiator returns GSS_S_COMPLETE to the caller, to indicate the
   initiator is authenticated and the context is ready for use.  No
   output token is emitted.  Supported security context flags are as for
   the acceptor context.  The flags returned to the caller are the
   intersection of supported and requested flags, combined with
   anon_state (GSS_C_ANON_FLAG) which is set unconditionally.

5.2.  Per-Message Tokens

   The per-message tokens definitions are imported from [RFC4121]
   Section 4.2.  The base key used to derive specific keys for signing
   and sealing messages is defined in Section 6.  The [RFC3961]
   encryption and checksum algorithms use the aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128
   encryption type defined in [RFC8009].  The AcceptorSubkey flag as
   defined in [RFC4121] Section 4.2.2 MUST be set.

5.3.  Context Deletion Tokens

   Context deletion tokens are empty in this mechanism.  The behavior of
   GSS_Delete_sec_context() [RFC2743] is as specified in [RFC4121]
   Section 4.3.

6.  Key derivation

   The context session key is known as the base key, and is computed
   using a key derivation function from [SP800-108] Section 5.1 (using
   HMAC as the PRF):

       base key = HMAC-SHA-256(K1, i | label | 0x00 | context | L)

   where:

   K1            the output of X25519(local secret key, peer public key)
                 as specified in [RFC7748] Section 6.1

   i             the constant 0x00000001, representing the iteration
                 count expressed in big-endian binary representation of
                 4 bytes

   label         the string "sanon-x25519" (without quotation marks)

   context       initiator public key | acceptor public key | channel
                 binding application data (if present)

   L             the constant 0x00000080, being length in bits of the
                 key to be outputted expressed in big-endian binary
                 representation of 4 bytes

   The inclusion of channel bindings in the key derivation function
   means that the acceptor cannot ignore initiator channel bindings;
   this differs from some other mechanisms.

   The base key provides the acceptor-asserted subkey defined in
   [RFC4121] Section 2 and is used to generate keys for per-message
   tokens and the GSS-API PRF.  Its encryption type is aes128-cts-hmac-
   sha256-128 per [RFC8009].  The [RFC3961] algorithm protocol
   parameters are as given in [RFC8009] Section 5.

7.  Pseudo-Random Function

   The [RFC4401] GSS-API pseudo-random function for this mechanism
   imports the definitions from [RFC8009], using the base key for both
   GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL and GSS_C_PRF_KEY_PARTIAL usages.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a GSS-API security mechanism, and therefore
   deals in security and has security considerations text embedded
   throughout.  This section only addresses security considerations
   associated with the SAnon mechanism described in this document.  It
   does not address security considerations associated with the GSS-API
   itself.

   This mechanism provides only for key agreement.  It does not
   authenticate the identity of either party.  It MUST NOT be selected
   if either party requires identification of its peer.

   SAnon mechanism names are not unary.  Implementations MUST ensure
   that GSS_Compare_name() always name_equal to FALSE when comparing
   mechanism names.

Appendix B.  Mechanism Attributes

   The [RFC5587] mechanism attributes for this mechanism are:

      GSS_C_MA_MECH_CONCRETE

      GSS_C_MA_ITOK_FRAMED

      GSS_C_MA_AUTH_INIT_ANON

      GSS_C_MA_AUTH_TARG_ANON

      GSS_C_MA_INTEG_PROT

      GSS_C_MA_CONF_PROT

      GSS_C_MA_MIC

      GSS_C_MA_WRAP

      GSS_C_MA_REPLAY_DET

      GSS_C_MA_OOS_DET

      GSS_C_MA_CBINDINGS

      GSS_C_MA_PFS

      GSS_C_MA_CTX_TRANS

Appendix C.  NegoEx

   When SAnon is negotiated by [I-D.zhu-negoex], the authentication
   scheme identifier is DEE384FF-1086-4E86-BE78-B94170BFD376.

   The initiator and acceptor keys for NegoEx checksum generation and
   verification are derived using the GSS-API PRF (see Section 7), with
   the input data "sanon-x25519-initiator-negoex-key" and "sanon-x25519-
   acceptor-negoex-key" respectively (without quotation marks).

Internet-Draft           SAnon GSS-API Mechanism              April 2020


   The initiator metadata, if present, contains a set of GSS-API flags
   encoded as a 4 byte little endian integer.  This is used to convey to
   the acceptor any Windows-specific GSS-API flags (see [RFC4757]
   Section 7.1).  Other GSS-API flags MUST NOT be present in the
   metadata.

   If the GSS-API implementation supports both SPNEGO [RFC4178] and
   NegoEx, SAnon SHOULD be advertised by both to maximise
   interoperability.
