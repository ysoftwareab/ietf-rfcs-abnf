                    URN Namespace for ETSI Documents
                        draft-mahesh-etsi-urn-05

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'etsi' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   European Telecommunications Standards Institute (http://etsi.org).
   ETSI specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN
   identification model.  Management activities for these and other
   resources types are handled by the manager of the ETSI Protocol
   Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS).

1.  Introduction

   ETSI is a nonprofit international industry standards organization,
   that produces globally acceptable standards for Information &
   Communication Technologies including fixed, mobile, radio, broadcast,
   internet, aeronautical and other areas.

   As part of these specifications efforts, there is a need to identify
   identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.
   To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a
   registration of a specific Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141]
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by ETSI is being specified in this
   document, in full conformance with the NID registration process
   specified in the document.

2.  URN Specification for ETSI

   Namespace Identifier:

      etsi

   Version:

      1

   Date:

      2018-10-22

   Registrant:

      ETSI Protocol Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS)

      European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)

      650, Route des Lucioles, Sophia Antipolis 06560, France

      pnns@etsi.org

   Purpose:

   The Namespace Identifier (NID) 'etsi' for Uniform Resource Names
   (URNs) will be used to identify resources published by ETSI.  These

Internet-Draft             Namespace for ETSI              November 2018


   might include published standards or protocols that it defines and
   which make use of URNs.  These namespaces are globally unique.  The
   URN namespace will be used in public networks by clients to configure
   and manage resources in the network.  It is the servers that will
   enforce the uniqueness of the namespaces by using the namespace and
   the XPath associated with the managed node in the network, when
   accessing a resource.

   Syntax:

      The syntax of namespace specific strings for the 'etsi' namespace
      is <NSS> in Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

   The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Assignment:

      ETSI will maintain the list of registered subtrees that use the
      "etsi" NID at https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx, in the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry.
      It will describe the <NSS>, how the namespaces will be allocated,
      and how experimental namespaces can be used within the allocated
      URN.

      ETSI will manage resource classes using the "etsi" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  ETSI will guarantee the uniqueness of the strings
      themselves, by validating it against the existing content of the
      registry.  It may also permit secondary responsibility for certain
      defined resources.  Once a subtree assignment is made, it cannot
      be deleted or reassigned.

      ETSI may allow for use of experimental type values in specific
      subtrees, for testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental
      types may create collision as multiple users may use the same
      values for different resources and specific strings.  All
      experimentation must follow the guidance set forth in A Uniform
      Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Examples [RFC6963].

   Interoperability:

   There are no known interoperability issues at this time.

   Resolution:

      It is not foreseen that URNs within this namespace will undergo
      resolution.

   Documentation:

      Documentation can be found at
      https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx.

3.  Examples

   The following are examples of URNs that ETSI is looking to assign:

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv-vnf

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv-pnf

   Although all of these examples are related to network management with
   YANG [RFC7950], URNs related to other kinds of resources might be
   assigned in the future, in which case a "sub-identifier" other than
   "yang" might be created.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations that are normally
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general, which are
   described in Function Requirements for URN [RFC1737], Uniform
   Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the formal URN namespace "etsi" using
   the template given above in Section 2.
