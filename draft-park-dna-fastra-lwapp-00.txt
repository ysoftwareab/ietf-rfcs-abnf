  Abstract 
   
     To provide fast handover in mobile environment, mobile node has to 
     discover neighbor router in visited network because of configuring 
     new IPv6 address as care-of address.  This document proposes new 
     method so as to reduce time delay when mobile node moves to a new 
     link particularly supporting LWAPP.  This extension is targeted to 
     Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) as well as to LWAPP.

  1. Introduction 
      
     Wireless and mobile node are subject to changing their point of 
     attachment from one access network to another [L2TRIGGER].  The 
     network attachment occurs when a link-layer connection is 
     established and mobile node can send and receive some IP packet in 
     attached network.  For network-layer connection, mobile node has to 
     gather required information by receiving RA message from router.  
     The fast handover is able to be used for mobile node to sustain 
     current connection without packet loss and latency.  This document 
     proposes new method to reduce time delay when mobile node moves to a 
     new link.  In particular, LWAPP [LWAPP] will be used by AP to 
     request RA message using 802.11 frame instead of layer 2 trigger 
     protocol.  LWAPP was about to discuss in CAPWAP Working Group.  Note 
     that this document only focus on fast RA method and others are out 
     of scope of this document.  [L2TRIGGER] can be used for enhanced 
     another method and it will be easily covered in near future if we 
     want.  This extension is described in this document can be also 
     applied to Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) as well.

     o LWAPP     Light Weight Access Point Protocol between AP and AR.

     o AR        Access Router. 
      
      
  3. Motivation 
      
     When mobile node moves to a new link, two kind of handover are 
     happened on mobile node as link-layer handover and network-layer 
     handover.   The network-layer handover occurs when link-layer 
     handover is established in a new link and mobile node can send and 
     receive some IP packets from neighbor nodes.  In particular, mobile 
     node has to discovery AR in order to obtain address configuration 
     parameters like valid prefix, lifetime and etc.  RA message is used 
     by AR to provide above parameters.  In wireless lan, RS message 
     request RA message has to be reached the AR through AP because AP is 
     a bridge.  There is no synchronization.  The purpose of new proposed 
     method is to synchronize among mobile node, AP and AR. The RA 
     Request message (in LWAPP) is used for synchronization between AP 
     and AR when AP receives Reassociation.request frame from mobile node.  
     This method does not require any modification of current AP except 
     LWAPP supporting, particularly, this scheme does not require 
     additional network-layer operations though.  This method also can be 
     efficiently used for fast RA without layer 2 trigger protocol. 
      
      
  4. Fast RA supporting LWAPP 
      
     In 57 IETF, LWAPP (Light Weight Access Point Protocol) was discussed 
     in CAPWAP BOF.  In particular, Control Channel Management messages 
     are used for the discovery of AR by the AP as well as the

     establishment and maintenance of an LWAPP control.  New defined RA 
     Request message will be used for request fast RA by AP.   
      
     Below figure depicts RA Request message format. 
      
     All LWAPP control messages are sent encapsulated within the LWAPP 
     header with the following header values: 
      
      
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |    Msg Type   |    Seq Num    |      Msg Element Length       | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
           o Msg Type              25 (or TBD) 
      
           o Seq Num               set to zero 
      
           o Msg Element Length    set to zero 
   
      
     If router receives RA Request message, then router has to send RA 
     message including configuration parameters immediately and this 
     message is silently discarded.  Note that RA message from router is 
     unsolicited RA message.  Immediately on receiving RA Request message 
     from AP, router has to send unsolicited RA message without random 
     delay.  Unsolicited RA message will be sent by router up to 
     MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS (default 3 times) which can be 
     reconfigured by operator policy.  When mobile node does not complete 
     link-layer attachment, unsolicited RA message will be silently 
     discarded.  
      
      
  5. Operation 
      
     LWAPP must be supported in both AP and AR in order to provide fast 
     RA.  Reassociation.request frame is sent by mobile node when mobile 
     node wants to change its association from its current AP to a new AP 
     and Reassociation.reply frame is sent by new AP either allowing or

     denying the request.  After establishing association, mobile node 
     sends RS message for RA to the new AR.  The new proposed method 
     combines existing methods and make use of LWAPP. 
      
     During AR discovery phase, AP MUST wait for an interval not less 
     than DiscoveryInterval for receipt of additional discovery replies 
     according to [LWAPP].   In addition, AP MUST store necessary 
     information of the additional discovery replies for candidates.  For 
     example, when the AR which AP joined does not function as a default 
     router (does not advertise RA message with Prefix information), or 
     its advertised router lifetime = 0, AP can request unsolicited RA to 
     one of the candidate ARs which are stored during AR discovery phase. 
     Preference indicated by new flag or alternatives can be used for AP 
     to decide its default router among them. 
      
     When AP receives Reassociation.request frame from mobile node, if AP 
     decides to allow the request, AP sends Reassociation.reply frame to 
     the mobile node as well as RA Request (Type = 25) to the AR using 
     LWAPP simultaneously.  After then, AR sends unsolicited RA up to 
     MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS (default 3 times) including 
     configuration parameters such as valid prefix, lifetime and etc.  
     Note that AR has to send unsolicited RA message without random delay 
     when receiving RA Request message by AP.  AR does not reply by RA 
     Request frame and silently discard.  [L2TRIGGER] can be used for 
     providing L2 events information from AP to other IP nodes such as 
     mobile node and AR.  Because of [L2TRIGGER], it is able to eliminate 
     the latency involved in waiting for a RA beacon from the AR, thus 
     increasing handover performance.  Network devices which do not 
     perform L2TRIGGER can be applied for the new proposed method of this 
     document.  Of course, AP and AR have to perform LWAPP with RA 
     Request message (Type = 25).  [L2TRIGGER] and new proposed method 
     can be combined as enhanced another method.  If possible, it will be 
     easily covered in near future. 
      
      
  6. IANA Considerations 
      
     There are no IANA considerations in this document.
