    Requirements for MPLS Label Stack Indicators and Ancillary Data
               draft-bocci-mpls-miad-adi-requirements-02

Abstract

   This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label
   stack to support ancillary data in the packet and high level
   requirements on that ancillary data.  This work is the product of the
   IETF MPLS Open Design Team.  Requirements are derived from a number
   of new proposals for additions to the MPLS label stack to allow
   forwarding or other processing decisions to be made, either by a
   transit or terminating LSR (i.e. the LER), based on application data
   that may be in or below the bottom of the label stack.

1.  Introduction

   There is significant interest in developing the MPLS data plane to
   address the requirements of new applications
   [I-D.saad-mpls-miad-usecases].  These applications typically require
   the inclusion of ancillary data in the MPLS packet.  This data may be
   encoded either in the label stack or below the bottom of the label
   stack.  This data is then either intercepted and processed, or some
   other forwarding decision is taken by routers processing the packet.
   The ancillary data is added by the ingress LSR, and then makes use of
   mechanisms implemented by an/or intermediate or egress LSRs that
   comply with the MPLS base architecture and potentially its
   extensions, including (but not limited to) [RFC3031], [RFC3032],
   [RFC6790].

   This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label
   stack to support these applications, as well as the encoding and use
   of the ancillary data.

1.1.  Terminology

   o  Ancillary Data: Data relating to the MPLS packet that may be used
      to affect the forwarding or other processing of that packet,
      either at an LER [RFC4221] or LSR.  This data may be encoded
      within the label stack (in-stack data), and/or after the bottom of
      the label stack (post-stack data).

Internet-Draft            MIAD ADI Requirements               March 2022


   o  In-Stack Data: Any data within the MPLS label stack including the
      outer LSE and the bottom of stack (the LSE with the S-bit set).

   o  Post-Stack Data: Any data beyond the LSE with the S-Bit set, but
      before the first octet of the user payload.  This document does
      not prescribe whether post-stack data precedes or follows any
      other protocol structure such as a control word or associated
      channel header (ACH).

   o  Ancillary Data Indicator (ADI): A indicator in the MPLS label
      stack that ancillary data exists in this packet.  It MAY also
      indicate the specific type of the ancillary data.

   o  End-to-End: End to end is defined as from one end of an LSP to the
      terminating end of the LSP.[Ed. this needs to be defined in the
      framework].

   o  Hop-by-Hop: From the ingress LER or an intermediate LSR to another
      intermediate LSR or egress LSR.  This implies processing along the
      LSP rather than at the endpoints, only [Ed. this needs to be
      defined in the framework].  ## Background

   The MPLS architecture is specified in [RFC3031] and provides a
   mechanism for forwarding packets through a network without requiring
   any analysis of the packet payload's network layer header by
   intermediate nodes (Label Switching Routers - LSRs).  Formally,
   inspection may only occur at network ingress (the Label edge router -
   LER) where the packet is assigned to a forwarding equivalence class
   (FEC).

   MPLS uses switching based on a label pushed on the packet to achieve
   efficient forwarding and traffic engineering of flows associated with
   the FEC.  While originally used for IP traffic, MPLS has been
   extended to support point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
   multipoint-to-multipoint layer 2 and layer 3 services.  An overview
   of the development of MPLS is provided in
   [I-D.bryant-mpls-dev-primer].

   A number of applications have emerged which require LSRs to make
   forwarding or other processing decisions based on inspection of the
   network layer header, or some other ancillary information in the
   protocol stack encapsulated deeper in the packet.  An early example
   of this was generation of a hash of the payload header to be used for
   load balancing over Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) or Link Aggregation
   Group (LAG) next hops.  This is based on an assumption that the
   network layer protocol is IP.  MPLS was extended to avoid the need
   for LSRs to perform this operation if load balancing was needed based
   on the payload and instead use only the MPLS label stack, using the

   Entropy Label / Entropy Label Indicator [RFC6790] which are inserted
   at the LER.  Other applications where the intermediate LSRs may need
   to inspect and process a packet on an LSP include OAM, which can make
   use of mechanisms such the Router Alert Label [RFC3032] or the
   Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) [RFC5586] to indicate that an
   intercepted packet should be processed locally.  See
   [I-D.bryant-mpls-dev-primer] for detailed list of such applications.

   There have been a number of new proposals for how ancillary data is
   carried in MPLS and how its presence is indicated to the LSR or
   egress LER, for example In-situ OAM and Service Function Chaining
   (SFC).  A summary of these proposals is contained in
   [I-D.bryant-mpls-dev-primer], an overview of use cases is provided in
   [Reference to MIAD use cases].  [I-D.song-mpls-extension-header]
   summarises some of the issues with existing solutions to address
   these new applications (note that this document draws on the
   requirements and issues without endorsing a specific solution from
   [I-D.song-mpls-extension-header]):

   These solutions rely on either the built-in next-protocol
   indicator in the header or the knowledge of the format and size of
   the header to access the following packet data.  The node is
   required to be able to parse the new header, which is unrealistic
   in an incremental deployment environment.

   A piecemeal solution often assumes the new header is the only
   extra header and its location in the packet is fixed by default.
   It is impossible or difficult to support multiple new headers in
   one packet due to the conflicted assumption.  An example of this
   is that the GAL/G-ACH mechanism assumes that if the GAL is
   present, only a single G-ACH header follows.

   New applications therefore require the definition of extensions to
   the MPLS architecture and label stack operations that can be used
   across these applications in order to minimise implementation
   complexity and promote interoperability and extensibility.

3.  MPLS Ancillary Data Indicator Requirements

   This document specifies requirements of MPLS Indicators for Ancillary
   Data (MIAD) and the Ancillary Data itself.  The requirements are for
   the behavior of the protocol mechanisms and procedures that
   constitute building blocks out of which indicators for ancillary data
   are constructed.  It does not specify the detailed processing that
   may be required by an application of that ancillary data by an LSR or
   LER.  The requirements in this document do not describe what
   functions an implementation must support.  The purpose of this
   document is to identify the toolkit and any new protocol work that is
   required.  This new protocol work MUST be based on the existing MPLS
   architecture.

   [Ed.  Note: for each of the sections below, we need to validate the
   order of the requirements].

3.1.  General Requirements

   1.  MPLS combines extensibility, flexibility and efficiency by using
       control plane context combined with a simple data plane mechanism
       to allow the network to make forwarding decisions about a packet.
       Any solution MUST maintain these properties of MPLS.

   2.  Any solutions to these requirements MUST NOT restrict the
       generality of MPLS architecture [RFC3031], [RFC3032].

   3.  If extensions to the MPLS data plane are required, they MUST NOT
       be inconsistent with the MPLS architecture [RFC3031], [RFC3032].

   4.  The design of any mechanism SHOULD be such that an LSR is able to
       efficiently parse the label stack.

   5.  Mechanisms MUST NOT add more labels to the stack than is
       necessary.

3.1.1.  Requirements on ADIs

   1.   When ancillary data is present in the MPLS label stack, a
        mechanism is REQUIRED to indicate its presence.  This mechanism
        is the ADI.

   2.   When ancillary data is present below the MPLS label stack, a
        mechanism is REQUIRED to indicate its presence.  This mechanism
        is the ADI.

Internet-Draft            MIAD ADI Requirements               March 2022


   3.   Any solution MUST respect the principle that Special Purpose
        Labels are the mechanism of last resort and therefore must
        minimise the number of new SPLs that are allocated.

   4.   Solutions for the ADI MUST be able to coexist with and MUST NOT
        obsolete existing MPLS mechanisms.

   5.   If the ADI is in the MPLS label stack, Ancillary Data Indicators
        (ADIs) SHOULD make use of existing MPLS data plane operations.

   6.   An ADI MUST NOT be delivered to a node that is not capable of
        processing it.  That is, an ADI MUST NOT become top of stack at
        a node that does not understand the ADI and is thus is not able
        to perform a disposition operation on it.  Disposition includes
        both processing and ignoring.

   7.   The ADI design MUST support end-to-end (E2E) processing of
        ancillary data.

   8.   The ADI design MUST support hop-by-hop (HBH) processing of
        ancillary data.

   9.   If a design allows both HBH and E2E ancillary data indicators to
        be present in the same packet, a mechanisms MUST be provided to
        specify the precedence.

   10.  A mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LER inserting ADIs to
        determine if the far-end LER can accept and process a packet
        containing a given ADI.

   11.  ADIs SHOULD be supported for both P2P and P2MP paths, but any
        specific ADI may only be supported for one or the other.

   12.  Data plane mechanisms for ADIs MUST be independent of the
        control plane type (LDP, RSVP, BGP, static, IGP, etc).

   13.  A mechanism MUST be defined for control planes in use (e.g.
        LDP, RSVP, BGP, static, IGP, etc) to determine the ability of
        downstream LSRs/LERs to accept/process a given ADI.

   14.  A mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LSR to determine if an ADI
        is present in a packet.

   15.  ADIs can only be inserted at LERs, but MAY be processed at LSRs
        and LERs.  If it is required to insert an ADI at a transit
        router on an LSP, then a new label stack MUST be pushed.

   16.  It SHOULD be possible to include indicators for multiple
        ancillary data objects in the same packet.

   17.  The solution MUST allow ADI-carrying and non-ADI-carrying
        packets to coexist on the same LSP.

   18.  The solution MUST support the processing of a subset of the ADIs
        on a packet.

   19.  The design of the ADIs MUST NOT expose confidential information
        [RFC6973] [RFC3552] to the LSRs.

   20.  Any specification of a solution that inserts or modifies the ADI
        MUST discuss the possible ECMP consequences.

3.1.2.  Requirements on Ancillary Data

   1.   Solutions for ancillary data within the label stack MUST be able
        to coexist with and MUST NOT obsolete existing MPLS mechanisms.

   2.   A common mechanism for ancillary data MUST be defined so that a
        node receiving the ancillary data can determine whether to
        process, ignore or discard it.

   3.   Any specification of a mechanism MUST describe whether it can
        coexist with existing post-stack data mechanisms e.g. control
        words and G-ACH, and if so how this coexistence operates.

   4.   A mechanisms SHOULD be defined for an LER or LSR inserting
        ancillary data to determine that each node that needs to process
        the ancillary data can read the required distance into the
        packet at that node, for example [RFC9088].

   5.   Ancillary data MAY be associated with control or maintenance
        information for traffic carried by an LSP, and/or it MAY be
        associated with the user traffic itself.

   6.   For HBH ancillary data, a mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LER
        inserting ADIs to determine if the ADI will be processed by LSRs
        along the path.  This MAY require a mechanism to determine if
        LSRs along the lath can process a specific type of AD indicated
        by the ADI at the depth in the stack that it will be presented
        to the LSR.

   7.   Application specifications MUST specify if the ancillary data
        needs to be processed as a part of the immediate forwarding
        operation and whether packet mis-ordering is allowed to occur as
        a result of the time taken to process the ancillary data.

Internet-Draft            MIAD ADI Requirements               March 2022


   8.   In order to prevent unnecessary scanning of the packet, care
        needs to be taken in the location of the ancillary data, for
        example it SHOULD be located as close to the label stack as
        possible.

   9.   A solution MUST be provided to verify the authenticity of
        ancillary data processed to LSRs [RFC3552].

   10.  The design of the ancillary data MUST NOT expose confidential
        information [RFC6973] [RFC3552] to the LSRs.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms required by this document introduce new security
   considerations to MPLS.  Individual solution specifications meeting
   these requirements MUST address any security considerations.
