1.  Introduction

   The IAOC has responsibility for arranging IETF plenary meeting venue
   selection and operation.  The purpose of this document is to guide
   the IAOC in their selection of regions, cities, and facilities, and
   hotels.  The IAOC applies this guidance at different points in the
   process in an attempt to faithfully meet the requirements of the IETF
   community.  We specify a set of general criteria for venue selection
   and several requirements for transparency and community consultation.

1.1.  Background

   Following IETF 94 and at IETF 95 there was a discussion on the IETF
   list of the selection process and criteria for IETF meetings.  In
   response to that discussion, the IAOC and the IAOC Meetings Committee
   took it upon themselves to more publicly document its process and
   refine it, based on input from IETF Participants.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   Requirements called out in this document are identified by the degree
   of requirement.  The labels that are used are:

   Mandatory:
      If this requirement cannot be met, a particular location is
      unacceptable for selection, and no contract is to be entered into.
      Should the IAOC learn that a location no longer can meet a
      mandatory requirement after having entered into a contract, it
      will inform the community and address the matter on a case by case
      basis.

   Important:
      Does not qualify as Mandatory, but is still highly significant.
      It can be traded against other Important items, such that a Venue
      that meets more of these criteria is on the whole more preferable
      than another that meets less of these criteria.  Requirements
      classed as Important can also be balanced across Venue selections
      for multiple meetings.

   Desired:

      We would very much like to meet this requirement, but the failure
      to meet it will not disqualify a Venue.

   While this document uses these terms and these meanings, it remains
   the responsibility of the IAOC to apply their best judgment.  The
   IAOC accepts input and feedback both during the consultation process
   and later (for instance when there are changes in the situation at a
   chosen location).  Any appeals remain subject to the provisions of
   BCP101 [RFC4071].  As always, the community is encouraged to provide
   direct feedback to the NOMCOM, IESG, and IAB regarding the discharge
   of the IAOC's performance.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Venue Selection Objectives

2.1.  Core Values

   Some IETF values pervade the selection process.  These often are
   applicable to multiple requirements listed in this document.  They
   are not limited to the following, but at minimum include:

   Why do we meet?
      We meet to pursue the IETF's mission [RFC3935], partly by
      advancing the development of Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  We also
      seek to facilitate attendee participation in multiple topics and
      to enable cross-pollination of ideas and technologies.

   Inclusiveness:
      We would like to facilitate the onsite or remote participation of
      anyone who wants to be involved.

      Every country has limits on who it will permit within its borders.
      However the IETF seeks to:

      1.  Minimize situations in which onerous entry regulations prevent
          participants from attending meetings, or failing that to
          distribute meeting locations such that onerous entry
          regulations are not always experienced by the same attendees

      2.  Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude
          people on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual
          orientation, national origin, or gender identity

   Where do we meet?

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                  April 2017


      We meet in different locations globally, in order to spread the
      difficulty and cost of travel among active participants, balancing
      travel time and expense across the regions in which IETF
      participants are based.

   Internet Access:
      As an organization, we write specifications for the Internet, and
      we use it heavily.  Meeting attendees need unfiltered access to
      the general Internet and our corporate networks.  "Unfiltered
      access" in this case means that all forms of communication are
      allowed.  This includes, but is not limited to, access to
      corporate networks via encrypted VPNs from the meeting Facility
      and Hotels, including overflow hotels.  We also need open network
      access available at high enough data rates, at the meeting
      Facility, to support our work, including the support of remote
      participation.  Beyond this, we are the first users of our own
      technology.  Any filtering may cause a problem with that
      technologiy's development.[MeetingNet]

   Focus:
      We meet to have focused technical discussions.  These are not
      limited to scheduled breakout sessions, although of course those
      are important.  They also happen over meals or drinks -- including
      a specific type of non-session that we call a "Bar BOF" -- or in
      side meetings.  Environments that are noisy or distracting prevent
      that or reduce its effectiveness, and are therefore less desirable
      as a meeting Facility.

   Economics:
      Meeting attendees participate as individuals.  While many are
      underwritten by employers or sponsors, many are self-funded.  In
      order to reduce participation costs and travel effort, we
      therefore seek locations that provide convenient budget
      alternatives for food and lodging, and which minimize travel
      segments from major airports to the Venue.  Within reason, budget
      should not be a barrier to accommodation.

   Least Astonishment and Openness:
      Regular participants should not be surprised by meeting Venue
      selections, particularly when it comes to locales.  To avoid
      surprise, the venue selection process, as with all other IETF
      processes, should be as open as practicable.  It should be
      possible for the community to engage early to express its views on
      prospective selections, so that the community, IAOC, and IAD can
      exchange views as to appropriateness long before a venue contract
      is considered.

2.2.  Venue Selection Non-Objectives

   IETF meeting Venues are not selected or declined with the explicit
   purposes of:

   Politics:
      Endorsing or condemning particular countries, political paradigms,
      laws, regulations, or policies.

   Maximal attendance:
      While the IETF strives to be as inclusive as possible both online
      and in person, maximal meeting attendance in and of itself is not
      a goal.  It would defeat a key goal of meeting if active
      contributors with differing points of view did not have the
      opportunity to resolve their disagreements, no matter how full the
      rooms.

   Tourism:
      Variety in site-seeing experiences.

3.  Venue Selection Criteria

   A number of criteria are considered during the site selection
   process.  The following list is not in any particular order, but
   includes the major considerations.

   The selection of a Venue always requires trade-offs.  There are no
   perfect venues.  For example, a site might not have a single hotel
   that can accommodate a significant number of the attendees of a
   typical IETF.  That doesn't disqualify it, but it might reduce its
   desirability in the presence of an alternative that does provide that
   single hotel.

   Some evaluation criteria are subjective.  For this reason, the IAOC
   and Meetings Committee will specifically review, and affirm to their
   satisfaction, that all "Mandatory" labeled criteria are satisfied by
   a particular Venue, as part of the process defined below in
   Section 5.

   Three terms describe the places for which the IETF contracts
   services:

   Venue:
      This is an umbrella term for the city, meeting resources and guest
      room resources.

   Facility:

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                  April 2017


      The building that houses meeting rooms and associated resources.
      It may also house an IETF Hotel or the Headquarters Hotel.

   IETF Hotels:
      One or more hotels, in close proximity to the Facility, where the
      IETF guest room allocations are negotiated and IETF SSIDs are in
      use.

   Headquarters Hotel:
      The hotel designated as primary for the IETF meeting.  It include
      IETF SSIDs for networking, might be adjoining -- or even contain
      -- the meeting Facility -- and typically has the bulk of the hotel
      room allocations.

3.1.  Venue City Criteria

   These concern basic aspects of a candidate city:

   +------------------------------------------------------+------------+
   | Travel to the Venue is acceptable based on cost,     | "Important |
   | time, and burden for participants traveling from     | "          |
   | multiple regions. It is anticipated that the burden  |            |
   | borne will be generally shared over the course of    |            |
   | multiple years.                                      |            |
   +------------------------------------------------------+------------+
   | The Venue is assessed as favorable for obtaining a   | "Important |
   | host and sponsors. That is, the Meeting is in a      | "          |
   | location and at a price that it is possible and      |            |
   | probable to find a host and sponsors.                |            |
   +------------------------------------------------------+------------+
   | It is possible to enter into a multi-event contract  | "Desired"  |
   | with the Facility and IETF Hotels to optimize        |            |
   | meeting and attendee benefits, i.e., reduce          |            |
   | administrative costs and reduce direct attendee      |            |
   | costs, will be considered a positive factor. Such a  |            |
   | contract can be considered after at least one IETF   |            |
   | meeting has been held at the Facility.               |            |
   +------------------------------------------------------+------------+
   | Travel barriers to entry, including visa             | "Important |

   +------------------------------------------------------+------------+
   | Economic, safety, and health risks associated with   | "Important |

   | [[Editor's Note: The implication here is that a note |            |
   | has been sent to the IETF that includes travel       |            |

3.2.  Basic Venue Criteria

   The IETF operates internationally and adjusts to local requirements.
   Facilities selected for IETF Meetings conform with local health,
   safety and accessibility laws and regulations.  A useful discussion
   of related considerations in evaluating this criterion is at:

      ***  Editor's Note  ***
         In the spirit of the 'international' focus, we need a

   | Criteria                                            | Required    |
   +-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | The Facility is assessed to be able to provide      | "Mandatory" |
   | sufficient space in an appropriate layout to        |             |
   | accommodate the expected number of people to attend |             |
   | that meeting.                                       |             |
   +-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | There are sufficient places (e.g., a mix of         | "Important" |
   | hallways, bars, meeting rooms, and restaurants) for |             |
   | people to hold ad hoc conversations and group       |             |
   | discussions.                                        |             |
   +-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | The cost of guest rooms, meeting space, meeting     | "Important" |
   | food and beverage is affordable, within the norms   |             |
   | of business travel.                                 |             |
   +-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | The economics of the Venue are in line with         | "Removed"   |
   | expectations agreed between ISOC and the IAOC.      |             |
   +-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | The Facility permits holding an IETF meeting under  | "Desired"   |
   | "One Roof". That is, qualified meeting space and    |             |
   | guest rooms are available in the same facility.     |             |

4.  Venue Selection Roles

   The formal structure of IETF administrative support functions is
   documented in BCP 101 [RFC4071], [RFC4371], [RFC7691].  The reader is
   expected to be familiar with the entities and roles defined by that
   document, in particular for the IASA, ISOC, IAOC and IAD.  This
   section covers the meeting selection related roles of these and other
   parties that participate in the process.  Note that roles beyond
   meeting selection, e.g., actually running and reporting on meetings,
   are outside the scope of this document.

4.1.  IETF Participants

   While perhaps obvious, it is important to note that IETF meetings
   serve all those who contribute to the work of the IETF.  This
   includes those who attend meetings in person, from newcomer to
   frequent attendee, to those who participate remotely, as well as
   those who do not attend but contribute to new RFCs.  Potential new
   contributors are also considered in the process.

   Participants have a responsibility to express their views about
   venues early and often, by responding to surveys or other
   solicitations from the IAD or IAOC, and by initiating fresh input as
   the Participant becomes aware of changes in venues that have been
   reviews.  This permits those responsible for venue selection to be




Pelletier, et al.       Expires October 20, 2017               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                  April 2017


   made aware of concerns relating to particular locations well in
   advance of having entered into contract discussions.

4.2.  IESG and IETF Chair

   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) comprises the IETF
   Area Directors and the IETF Chair.  Along with the IAB, the IESG is
   responsible for the management of the IETF, and is the standards
   approval board for the IETF, as described in BCP9 [RFC2026].  This
   means that the IESG sets high level policies related to, among other
   things, meeting venues.  The IETF Chair, among other things, relays
   these IESG-determined policies to the IAOC.  The IETF Chair is also a
   member of the IAOC.

4.3.  The Internet Society

   With respect to IETF meetings, the Internet Society (ISOC):

   o  Executes all Venue contracts on behalf of the IETF at the request
      of the IAOC

   o  Solicits meeting sponsorships

   o  Collects all meeting-related revenues, including registration
      fees, sponsorships, hotel commissions, and other miscellaneous
      revenues

   ISOC also provides accounting services, such as invoicing and monthly
   financial statements.

4.4.  IETF Administrative Oversight Committee

   The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has the
   responsibility to oversee and select IETF meeting venues.  It
   instructs the IAD to work with the Internet Society to write the
   relevant contracts.  It approves the IETF meetings calendar.  In
   cooperation with the IAD, the IAOC takes necessary actions to ensure
   that it is aware of participant concerns about particular venues as
   early in the process as is feasible.

4.5.  IETF Administrative Support Activity

   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) supports the meeting
   selection process.  This includes identifying, qualifying and
   reporting on potential meeting sites, as well as supporting meeting
   Venue contract negotiation.  The IETF Secretariat is part of the IASA
   under the management of the IAD.  The IAD takes appropriate actions




Pelletier, et al.       Expires October 20, 2017               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                  April 2017


   to solicit community input regarding both retrospective and
   prospective feedback from participants.

4.6.  IETF Administrative Director

   The IETF Administrative Director (IAD) coordinates and supports the
   activities of the IETF Secretariat, the IAOC Meetings Committee and
   the IAOC to ensure the timely execution of the meeting process.  This
   includes participating in the IAOC Meeting Subcommittee and ensuring
   its efforts are documented, leading Venue contract negotiation, and
   coordinating contract execution with ISOC.  The meetings budget is
   managed by the IAD.

4.7.  IAOC Meeting Committee

   The fundamental purpose of the Meetings Committee is to participate
   in the Venue selection process, and to formulate recommendations to
   the IAOC regarding meeting sites.  It also tracks the meetings
   sponsorship program, recommends extraordinary meeting-related
   expenses, and recommends the IETF meetings calendar to the IAOC.  The
   charter of the committee is at: <https://iaoc.ietf.org/
   committees.html#meetings>.

   Membership in the Meetings Committee is at the discretion of the
   IAOC; it includes an IAOC appointed chair, the IETF Administrative
   Director (IAD), IAOC members, representatives from the Secretariat,
   and interested members of the community.

5.  Venue Selection Steps

   The following sequence is used by the IAOC to select venues.  Unless
   otherwise stated below, the IAOC may evolve these steps over time
   without updating this document.[[ED- this chapeau text is not agreed.
   On-list discussion continues.]]

5.1.  Identification

   Four years out, a process identifies cities that might be candidates
   for meetings.  For example:

   a.  The IAOC selects regions, cities, and dates for meetings.

   b.  A list of target cities per region is provided to the
       Secretariat, with host preferences, if known.

   c.  Potential venues in preferred cities are identified and receive
       preliminary investigation, including reviews of Official Advisory
       Sources, consultation with specialty travel services, frequent

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                  April 2017


       travelers and local contacts to identify possible barriers to
       holding a successful meeting in the target cities.

   d.  Investigated cities and findings are provided by the Secretariat
       to the Meetings Committee for further review.  Meetings Committee
       makes a recommendation to the IAOC of investigated/target cities
       to consider further as well as issues identified and the results
       of research conducted.

5.2.  Consultation

   The IAOC MUST consult the community about potential new venues prior
   to them being booked.  The timing and means by which it does so may
   vary over time.  The consultation may overlap with the previous step
   (identification).

   For example:

   a.  The IAOC asks the community whether there are any barriers to
       holding a successful meeting in any of the target cities in the
       set.

   b.  Community responses are reviewed and concerns investigated by the
       Meetings Committee.  The results together with recommendations
       for whether each city should be considered as potential meeting
       location is provided to the IAOC.

   c.  The IAOC identifies which cities are to be considered as a
       potential meeting location.

   d.  On a public web page, the IAOC lists all candidate cities, when
       community input was solicited, and if a city is to be considered
       as a potential meeting location.

   e.  The Meetings Committee pursues potential meeting locations based
       on the posted list of cities that have been identified as a
       potential meeting locations.

5.3.  Qualification

   Visit:

   a.  Secretariat assesses "vetted" target cities to determine
       availability and conformance to criteria.

   b.  Meetings Committee approves potential cities for site
       qualification visit.

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                  April 2017


   c.  Site qualification visits are arranged by Secretariat and
       preliminary negotiations are undertaken with selected potential
       sites.

   d.  Site qualification visit is conducted using the checklist along
       the lines of what is included in Appendix A; the site visit team
       prepares a site report and discusses it with the Meetings
       Committee.

5.4.  Negotiation

   2.75 - 3 years out, initiate contract negotiations:

   a.  The Meetings Committee reviews the Venue options based on Venue
       selection criteria and recommends a Venue to the IAOC.  Only
       options that meet all Mandatory labeled criteria might be
       recommended.

   b.  IAOC selects a Venue for contracting as well as a back-up
       contracting Venue, if available.

   c.  Secretariat negotiates with selected Venue.  IAD reviews contract
       and requests IAOC and ISOC approval of contract and authority for
       Secretariat to execute contract on ISOC's behalf.

   d.  Contracts are executed.

5.5.  Late Changes

   If at any time after a contract is signed the IAOC learns where a
   Venue's circumstances have significantly changed, such that the
   Important or Mandatory criteria can no longer be met, the IAOC MUST
   reconsider the selection.  A description of how reconsideration
   currently takes place is found in Appendix B.  The IAOC will gauge
   the cost of making a change against the ability of the IETF to
   conclude a successful meeting, and make a final determination based
   on their best judgment.  When there is enough time to do so, the IAOC
   MUST consult the community about changes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

7.  Security Considerations

   This note proposes no protocols, and therefore no new protocol
   insecurities.
