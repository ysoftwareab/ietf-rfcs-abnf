1.  Introduction

   This document complements [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf] by discussing the
   applicability of the technology in a simple and fairly common
   deployment scenario, which is described in Section 4.

   After describing the deployment scenario, Section 5 will describe the
   reasons for BGP modifications for such deployments.

   Once the control plane routing protocol requirements are described,
   Section 6 will cover the LSVR protocol enhancements to BGP to meet
   these requirements and their applicability to Data Center CLOS
   networks.

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommended Reading

   This document assumes knowledge of existing data center networks and
   data center network topologies [CLOS].  This document also assumes
   knowledge of data center routing protocols like BGP [RFC4271], BGP-
   SPF [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf], OSPF [RFC2328], as well as, data center
   OAM protocols like LLDP [RFC4957] and BFD [RFC5580].

4.  Common Deployment Scenario

   Within a Data Center, a common network design to interconnect servers
   is done using the CLOS topology [CLOS].  The CLOS topology is fully
   non-blocking and the topology is realized using Equal Cost Multipath
   (ECMP).  In a CLOS topology, the minimum number of parallel paths
   between two servers is determined by the width of a tier-1 stage as
   shown in the figure 1.

   The following example illustrates multistage CLOS topology.

5.  Justification for BGP SPF Extension

   Many data centers use BGP as a routing protocol to create an overlay
   as well as an underlay network for their CLOS Topologies to simplify
   layer-3 routing and operations [RFC7938].  However, BGP is a path-
   vector routing protocol.  Since it does not create a fabric topology,
   it uses hop-by-hop EBGP peering to facilitate hop-by-hop routing to
   create the underlay network and to resolve any overlay next hops.
   The hop-by-hop BGP peering paradigm imposes several restrictions
   within a CLOS.  It severely prohibits a deployment of Route
   Reflectors/Route Controllers as the EBGP sessions are inline with the
   data path.  The BGP best path algorithm is prefix-based and it
   prevents announcements of prefixes to other BGP speakers until the
   best path decision process is performed for the prefix at each
   intermediate hop.  These restrictions significantly delay the overall
   convergence of the underlay network within a CLOS.

   The LSVR SPF modifications allow BGP to overcome these limitations.
   Furthermore, using the BGP-LS NLRI format [RFC7752] allows the LSVR
   data to be advertised for nodes, links, and prefixes in the BGP
   routing domain and used for SPF computations.

6.  LSVR Applicability to CLOS Networks

   With the BGP SPF extensions [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf], the BGP best
   path computation and route computation are replaced with OSPF-like
   algorithms [RFC2328] both to determine whether an BGP-LS NLRI has
   changed and needs to be re-advertised and to compute the routing
   table.  These modifications will significantly improve convergence of
   the underlay while affording the operational benefits of a single
   routing protocol [RFC7938].

   Data center controllers typically require visibility to the BGP
   topology to compute traffic-engineered paths.  These controllers
   learn the topology and other relevant information via the BGP-LS
   address family [RFC7752] which is totally independent of the underlay
   address families (usually IPv4/IPv6 unicast).  Furthermore, in
   traditional BGP underlays, all the BGP routers will need to advertise
   their BGP-LS information independently.  With the BGP SPF extensions,
   controllers can learn the topology using the same BGP advertisements
   used to compute the underlay routes.  Furthermore, these data center
   controllers can avail the convergence advantages of the BGP SPF
   extensions.  The placement of controllers can be outside of the
   forwarding path or within the forwarding path.

   Alternatively, as each and every router in the BGP SPF domain will
   have a complete view of the topology, the operator can also choose to
   configure BGP sessions in hop-by-hop peering model described in



Patel, et al.           Expires January 26, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2018


   [RFC7938] along with BFD [RFC5580].  In doing so, while the hop-by-
   hop peering model lacks inherent benefits of the controller-based
   model, BGP updates need not be serialized by BGP best path algorithm
   in either of these models.  This helps overall network convergence.

6.1.  Usage of BGP-LS SAFI

   The BGP SPF extensions [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf] define a new BGP-LS
   SAFI for announcement of BGP SPF link-state.  The NLRI format and its
   associated attributes follow the format of BGP-LS for node, link, and
   prefix announcements.  Whether the peering model within a CLOS
   follows hop-by-hop peering described in [RFC7938] or any controller-
   based or route-reflector peering, an operator can exchange BGP SPF
   SAFI routes over the BGP peering by simply configuring BGP SPF SAFI
   between the necessary BGP speakers.

   The BGP-LS SPF SAFI can also co-exist with BGP IP Unicast SAFI which
   could exchange overlapping IP routes.  The routes received by these
   SAFIs are evaluated, stored, and announced separately according to
   the rules of [RFC4760].  The tie-breaking of route installation is a
   matter of the local policies and preferences of the network operator.

   Finally, as the BGP SPF peering is done following the procedures
   described in [RFC4271], all the existing transport security
   mechanisms including [RFC5925] are available for the BGP-LS SPF SAFI.

6.1.1.  Relationship to Other BGP AFI/SAFI Tuples

   Normally, the BGP-LS AFI/SAFI is used solely to compute the underlay
   and is given preference over other AFI/SAFIs.  Other BGP SAFIs, e.g.,
   IPv6/IPv6 Unicast VPN would use the BGP-SPF computed routes for next
   hop resolution.  However, if BGP-LS NLRI is also being advertised for
   controller consumption, there is no need to replicate the Node, Link,
   and Prefix NLRI in BGP-NLRI.  Rather, additional NLRI attributes can
   be advertised in the BGP-LS SPF AFI/SAFI as required.

6.2.  Peering Models

   As previously stated, BGP SPF can be deployed using the existing
   peering model where there is a single hop BGP session on each and
   every link in the data center fabric [RFC7938].  This provides for
   both the advertisement of routes and the determination of link and
   neighboring switch availability.  With BGP SPF, the underlay will
   converge faster due to changes in the decision process which will
   allow NLRI changes to be advertised faster after detecting a change.

   Alternately, BFD [RFC5580] can be used to swiftly determine the
   availability of links and the BGP peering model can be significantly



Patel, et al.           Expires January 26, 2019                [Page 5]

   sparser than the data center fabric.  BGP SPF sessions then only be
   established with enough peers to provide a bi-connected graph.  If
   IEBGP is used, then the BGP routers at tier N-1 will act as route-
   reflectors for the routers at tier N.

6.2.1.  Bi-Connected Graph Heuristic

   With this heuristic, discovery of BGP peers is assumed Section 6.3.
   Additionally, it assumed that the direction of the peering can be
   ascertained.  In the context of a data center fabric, direction is
   either northbound (toward the spine), southbound (toward the Top-Of-
   Rack (TOR) switches) or east-west (same level in hierarchy.  The
   determination of the direction is beyond the scope of this document.
   However, it would be reasonable to assume a technique where the TOR
   switches can be identified and the number of hops to the TOR is used
   to determine the direction.

   In this heuristic, BGP speakers allow passive session establishment
   for southbound BGP sessions.  For northbound sessions, BGP speakers
   will attempt to maintain two northbound BGP sessions with different
   switches (in data center fabrics there is normally a single layer-3
   connection anyway).  For east-west sessions, passive BGP session
   establishment is allowed.  However, BGP speaker will never actively
   establish an east-west BGP session unless it can't establish two
   northbound BGP sessions.

6.3.  BGP Peer Discovery

6.3.1.  BGP Peer Discovery Requirements

   The most basic requirement is to be able to discover the address of a
   single-hop peer without pre-configuration.  This is being
   accomplished today with using IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA)
   [RFC4861] and assuming that a BGP sessions is desired with any
   discovered peer.  Beyond the basic requirement, it is useful to have
   to following information relating to the BGP session:

   o  Autonomous System (AS) and BGP Identifier of a potential peer.
      The latter can be used for debugging and to decrease the
      likelihood of BGP session establishment collisions.

   o  Security capabilities supported and for cryptographic
      authentication, the security capabilities and possibly a key-chain
      [RFC8177] to be used.

   o  Session Policy Identifier - A group number or name used to
      associate common session parameters with the peer.  For example,




Patel, et al.           Expires January 26, 2019                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2018


      in a data center, BGP sessions with a Top of Rack (ToR) device
      could have parameters than BGP sessions between leaf and spine.

   In a data center fabric, it is often useful to know whether a peer is
   southbound (towards the servers) or northbound (towards the spine or
   super-spine) Section 6.2.1.  A potential requirement would also be to
   determine this dynamically.  One mechanism, without specifying all
   the details, might be for the ToRs to be identified when installed
   and for the others switches in the fabric to determine their level
   based on the distance from the closest ToR.

   If there are multiple links between BGP speakers or the links between
   BGP speakers are unnumbered, it is also useful to be able to
   establish multi-hop sessions using the loopback addresses.  This will
   often require the discovery protocol to install route(s) toward the
   potential peer loopback addresses prior to BGP session establishment.

   Finally, a simple BGP discovery protocol could also be used to
   establish a multi-hop session with one or more controllers by
   advertising connectivity to one or more controllers.  However, once
   the multi-hop session actually traverses multiple nodes, it is
   bordering a distance-vector routing protocol and possibly this is not
   a good requirement for the discovery protocol.

6.3.2.  BGP Peer Discovery Alternatives

   While BGP peer discovery is not part of [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf],
   there are, at least, three proposals for BGP peer discovery.  At
   least one of these mechanisms will be adopted and will be applicable
   to deployments other than the data center.  It is strongly
   RECOMMENDED that the accepted mechanism be used in conjunction with
   BGP SPF in data centers.  The BGP discovery mechanism should
   discovery both peer addresses and endpoints for BFD discovery.
   Additionally, it would be great if there were a heuristic for
   determining whether the peer is at a tier above or below the
   discovering BGP speaker (refer to Section 6.2.1).

   The BGP discovery mechanisms under consideration are
   [I-D.acee-idr-lldp-peer-discovery],
   [I-D.xu-idr-neighbor-autodiscovery], and [I-D.ymbk-lsvr-lsoe].

6.3.3.  Data Center Interconnect (DCI) Applicability

   Since BGP SPF is to be used for the routing underlay and DCI gateway
   boxes typically have direct or very simple connectivity, BGP external
   sessions would typically not include the BGP SPF SAFI.

6.4.  Non-CLOS/FAT Tree Topology Applicability

   The BGP SPF extensions [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf] can be used in other
   topologies and avail the inherent convergence improvements.
   Additionally, sparse peering techniques may be utilized Section 6.2.
   However, determining whether or to establish a BGP session is more
   complex and the heuristic described in Section 6.2.1 cannot be used.
   In such topologies, other techniques such as those described in
   [I-D.li-dynamic-flooding] may be employed.  One potential deployment
   would be the underlay for a Service Provider (SP) backbone where
   usage of a single protocol, i.e., BGP, is desired.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA updates are requested by this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations above and
   beyond those already specified in the [RFC4271] and
   [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf].
