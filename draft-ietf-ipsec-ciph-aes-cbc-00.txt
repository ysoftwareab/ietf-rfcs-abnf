1.   Introduction

   Recognizing that the venerable DES cipher was reaching the end of its
   useful life, in January 1997 NIST (the National Institute of Stan-
   dards and Technology) announced a plan to select its successor, the
   AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).  The AES will be the government's
   designated encryption cipher, and will be definitively described in a
   FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard).  The expectation is
   that the AES will suffice to protect sensitive government information
   at least until the next century.  It is also expected to be widely
   adopted by businesses and financial institutions.

   The initial call for AES candidates specified the following require-
   ments:

     +    unclassified

     +    publicly disclosed

     +    available royalty-free worldwide

     +    capable of handling a block size of at least 128 bits

     +    at a minimum, capable of handling key sizes of 128, 192, and
          256 bits


   The distinguishing characteristics on which the final AES cipher will
   be selected are:

     +    security

     +    computational efficiency and memory requirements on a variety
          of software and hardware, including smart cards

     +    flexibility and simplicity


   Of the 15 ciphers that were submitted as AES candidates in August
   1998, 5 were designated as finalists. Analysis and discussion of the
   candidates continues.  Either 1 or 2 of the finalists will be
   selected as the AES cipher; the AES FIPS is expected to be completed
   by summer 2001.

   It is the intention of the IETF IPsec Working Group that AES will
   eventually be adopted as the default IPsec ESP cipher and will obtain
   the status of MUST be included in compliant IPsec implementations.
   However, until 1 or 2 of the finalists are selected and until there
   is more experience with regard to the cryptographic strengths and
   weaknesses of the algorithms, this document should be used to experi-
   ment with the AES candidates and determine how they can best be used
   in IPsec implementations.  This document should be considered experi-
   mental.

   The remainder of this document specifies the use of the five finalist
   AES candidate ciphers within the context of IPsec ESP.  For further
   information on how the various pieces of ESP fit together to provide
   security services, refer to [ARCH], [ESP], and [ROAD].

1.1  Specification of Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" that
   appear in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC-2119].

2.   The Candidate AES Cipher Algorithms

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and
   rounds.  The following sections contain descriptions of the relevant
   characteristics of the candidate AES ciphers.

   Some of the candidate AES ciphers are covered by copyrights, patents
   or patent applications.  Each submitter has sworn that, if selected
   as the AES cipher algorithm, the algorithm will be made available
   world-wide on a royalty-free basis.

   The AES homepage, http://www.nist.gov/aes, contains a wealth of in-
   formation about the 5 finalists, including definitive descriptions of
   each algorithm, comparative analyses, performance statistics, test
   vectors and intellectual property information.  This site also con-
   tains information on how to obtain reference implementations from
   NIST for each of the candidate algorithms.

2.1  Mode

   No operational modes are currently defined for the AES ciphers.  How-
   ever, the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode is well-defined and well-
   understood for symmetric ciphers, and is currently required for all
   other ESP ciphers.  This document specifies the use of the AES ci-
   phers in CBC mode within ESP.  This mode requires an Initialization
   Vector (IV) that is the same size as the block size.  Use of a ran-
   domly generated IV prevents generation of identical ciphertext from
   packets which have identical data that spans the first block of the
   cipher algorithm's block size.

   The IV is XOR'd with the first plaintext block before it is encrypt-
   ed.  Then for successive blocks, the previous ciphertext block is
   XOR'd with the current plaintext, before it is encrypted.

   More information on CBC mode can be obtained in [CRYPTO-S].  For the
   use of CBC mode in ESP with 64-bit ciphers, see [CBC].

   [AUTHORS' NOTE: Should we require CBC mode using the ciphertext from
   the previously generated block? On the AES discussion list, it has
   been suggested that a Counter Feedback Mode be defined, which allows
   parallel encryption of blocks. Should we stick with CBC, use some

   variant of a Counter Feedback Mode, or wait for the AES FIPS to de-
   cide?]

2.2  Key Size

   Some cipher algorithms allow for variable sized keys, while others
   only allow specific, pre-defined key sizes.  The length of the key
   typically correlates with the strength of the algorithm; thus larger
   keys are usually harder to break than shorter ones.

   This document stipulates that all key sizes MUST be a multiple of 8
   bits.

   This document specifies the default (i.e. MUST be supported) key size
   for all of the AES cipher algorithms.  All of the candidate ciphers
   were required to accept key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. The de-
   fault key size that implementations MUST support for IPsec is 128
   bits.


   +============+=========================+===========+
   | Algorithm  |  Key Sizes (bits)       |  Default  |
   +============+=========================+===========+
   | MARS       |  128 - 448*             |  128      |
   +------------+-------------------------+-----------+
   | RC6        |  variable up to 2040    |  128      |
   +------------+-------------------------+-----------+
   | Rijndael   |  128, 192, 256          |  128      |
   +------------+-------------------------+-----------+
   | Serpent    |  variable up to 256**   |  128      |
   +------------+-------------------------+-----------+
   | Twofish    |  variable up to 256***  |  128      |
   +------------+-------------------------+-----------+

   *NOTE1: MARS key lengths must be multiples of 32 bits.
   **NOTE2: Serpent keys are always padded to 256 bits. The padding con-
   sists of a "1" bit followed by "0" bits.
   ***NOTE3: Twofish keys, other than the default sizes, are always
   padded with "0" bits up to the next default size.

2.3  Weak Keys

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   any of the AES ciphers.

   Some cipher algorithms have weak keys or keys that MUST not be used
   due to their interaction with some aspect of the cipher's definition.
   If weak keys are discovered for any of the AES ciphers, then weak
   keys SHOULD be checked for and discarded when using manual key man-
   agement.  When using dynamic key management, such as [IKE], weak key
   checks SHOULD NOT be performed as they are seen as an unnecessary
   added code complexity that could weaken the intended security [EVALU-
   ATION].

2.4  Block Size and Padding

   All of the algorithms described in this document use a block size of
   sixteen octets (128 bits), as required in the AES specifications.
   Some of the algorithms can handle larger block sizes as well.

   Padding is required by the candidate AES algorithms to maintain a
   16-octet (128-bit) blocksize.  Padding MUST be added, as specified in
   [ESP], such that the data to be encrypted (which includes the ESP Pad
   Length and Next Header fields) has a length that is a multiple of 16
   octets.

   Because of the algorithm specific padding requirement, no additional
   padding is required to ensure that the ciphertext terminates on a
   4-octet boundary (i.e. maintaining a 16-octet blocksize guarantees
   that the ESP Pad Length and Next Header fields will be right aligned
   within a 4-octet word).   Additional padding may be included, as
   specifed in [ESP], as long as the 16-octet blocksize is maintained.

2.5  Rounds

   This variable determines how many times a block is encrypted.  While
   this variable MAY be negotiated, a default value MUST always exist
   when it is not negotiated.



   +============+===============+=======================+
   | Algorithm  |  Negotiable?  |  Default # of Rounds  |
   +============+===============+=======================+
   | MARS       |  Yes          |  32                   |
   +------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | RC6        |  Yes          |  20                   |
   +------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | Rijndael   |  Yes          |  10, 12, 14*          |
   +------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | Serpent    |  Yes          |  32                   |
   +------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | Twofish    |  Yes          |  16                   |
   +------------+---------------+-----------------------+

   *NOTE1: Rijndael's Default # of Rounds is dependent on key size. De-
   fault # of Rounds = keylen/32 + 6.

   other analyses. The individual cypher documents, [MARS-1], [MARS-2],
   [RC6], [RIJNDAEL], [SERPENT-1], [SERPENT-2], [TWOFISH-1] and
   [TWOFISH-2] also contain performance statistics.

3.   ESP Payload

   The ESP payload is made up of the IV followed by raw cipher-text.
   Thus the payload field, as defined in [ESP], is broken down according
   to the following diagram:

    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    |                                                               |
    +               Initialization Vector (16 octets)               +
    |                                                               |
    +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    |                                                               |
    ~ Encrypted Payload (variable length, a multiple of 16 octets)  ~
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   The IV field MUST be the same size as the block size of the cipher
   algorithm being used.  The IV MUST be chosen at random.  Common prac-
   tice is to use random data for the first IV and the last block of en-
   crypted data from an encryption process as the IV for the next en-
   cryption process.

   Including the IV in each datagram ensures that decryption of each re-
   ceived datagram can be performed, even when some datagrams are
   dropped, or datagrams are re-ordered in transit.

   To avoid ECB encryption of very similar plaintext blocks in different
   packets, implementations MUST NOT use a counter or other low-Hamming
   distance source for IVs.

3.1  ESP Algorithmic Interactions

   Currently, there are no known issues regarding interactions between
   these algorithms and other aspects of ESP, such as use of certain au-
   thentication schemes.

3.2  Keying Material

   The minimum number of bits sent from the key exchange protocol to the
   ESP algorithm must be greater than or equal to the key size.

   The cipher's encryption and decryption key is taken from the first
   <x> bits of the keying material, where <x> represents the required
   key size.

3.3  IKE Interactions

   To facilitate the experimental use of the AES candidate ciphers, it
   would be useful to temporarily define standard IPsec ESP Transform
   Identifiers for each of the AES algorithms.  [DOI] reserves the val-



Frankel,Glenn,Kelly                                             [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT   <draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-cbc-00.txt>       March 2000


   ues 249-255 for "private use amongst cooperating systems."  The fol-
   lowing IPsec ESP Transform Identifiers are suggested for IKE interop-
   erability using the AES candidate ciphers:


   +===================+=========+
   | Transform ID      |  Value  |
   +===================+=========+
   | ESP_AES_MARS      |  249    |
   +-------------------+---------+
   | ESP_AES_RC6       |  250    |
   +-------------------+---------+
   | ESP_AES_RIJNDAEL  |  251    |
   +-------------------+---------+
   | ESP_AES_SERPENT   |  252    |
   +-------------------+---------+
   | ESP_AES_TWOFISH   |  253    |
   +-------------------+---------+

   Since the AES candidate ciphers allow variable key lengths, the Key
   Length attribute MUST be specified in a Phase 2 exchange [DOI].  The
   Key Length attribute MAY be specified in a Phase 1 exchange [IKE]; if
   it is not specified, the default key length is 128 bits.

   If IKE is used to negotiate keys for the AES candidate ciphers, the
   recommended characteristics of the groups governing the Diffie-Hell-
   man exchange are as follows:


   +===========+=================+================+===============+
   | Key Size  |  Exponent Size  |  Modulus Size  |  Group Type   |
   +===========+=================+================+===============+
   | 128       |  256            |  3240          |  MODP         |
   +-----------+-----------------+----------------+---------------+
   | 192       |  384            |  7945          |  MODP         |
   +-----------+-----------------+----------------+---------------+
   | 256       |  512            |  15430         |  MODP         |
   +-----------+-----------------+----------------+---------------+
   | 128       |  248            |  248           |  EC2N         |
   +-----------+-----------------+----------------+---------------+
   | 192       |  376            |  376           |  EC2N         |
   +-----------+-----------------+----------------+---------------+
   | 256       |  504            |  504           |  EC2N         |
   +-----------+-----------------+----------------+---------------+

   NOTE: This table is based on Section 4.5 in [KEYLEN-1] and on email
   communications with Hilarie Orman [KEYLEN-2].

   Additional information about the relationship between the group gov-
   erning a Diffie-Hellman exchange and the symmetric keys derived from
   the exchange can be found in [KEYLEN-1].

   For symmetric key lengths that exceed the output of the hash used to
   generate the key, the Diffie-Hellman shared secret MUST be hashed

        P2 = Hash(1|shared_secret)

        keying_material = (P1 << shift_bits XOR P2)

   The first hash output, P1, is shifted left a variable number of bits,
   depending upon the hash and the key length, prior to XOR'ing it with
   the second hash output, P2.

   | Key Size  |  Hash   |  Dual DH?  |  # of Shift Bits  |

   | 256       |  SHA-1  |  Y         |  96               |
   +-----------+---------+------------+-------------------+

   If additional keying material is required for an authentication key,
   IKE's iterative key-boosting algorithm MUST be used [IKE, Section
   6.2].

4.   Security Considerations

   Implementations are encouraged to use the largest key sizes they can
   when taking into account performance considerations for their partic-
   ular hardware and software configuration.  Note that encryption nec-
   essarily impacts both sides of a secure channel, so such considera-
   tion must take into account not only the client side, but the server
   as well.

   Because these candidate AES algorithms are relatively new and have
   only undergone limited cryptographic analysis, their use in IPsec im-
   plementations should be considered experimental.  Once NIST has pub-
   lished the AES FIPS, and at the recommendation of cryptographic ex-
   perts, AES should become a default and mandatory-to-implement cipher
   algorithm for IPsec.

   For more information regarding the necessary use of random IV values,
   see [CRYPTO-B].

   For further security considerations, the reader is encouraged to read
   the documents that describe the actual cipher algorithms.
