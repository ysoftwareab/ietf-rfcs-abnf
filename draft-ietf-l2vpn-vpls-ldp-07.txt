Abstract 
   
  This document describes a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) 
  solution using pseudo-wires, a service previously implemented over 
  other tunneling technologies and known as Transparent LAN Services 
  (TLS).  A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment for a given set of 
  users, i.e., it creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully 
  capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses that

  is closed to a given set of users.  Multiple VPLS services can be 
  supported from a single PE node. 
   
  This document describes the control plane functions of signaling 
  pseudo-wire labels, extending [PWE3-CTRL].  It is agnostic to 
  discovery protocols.  The data plane functions of forwarding are 
  also described, focusing, in particular, on the learning of MAC 
  addresses.  The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by 
  [PWE3-ETHERNET].

3. Introduction 
   
  Ethernet has become the predominant technology for Local Area 
  Network (LAN) connectivity and is gaining acceptance as an access 
  technology, specifically in Metropolitan and Wide Area Networks 
  (MAN and WAN, respectively).  The primary motivation behind Virtual 
  Private LAN Services (VPLS) is to provide connectivity between 
  geographically dispersed customer sites across MANs and WANs, as if 
  they were connected using a LAN.  The intended application for the 
  end-user can be divided into the following two categories: 
   
  - Connectivity between customer routers: LAN routing application 
  - Connectivity between customer Ethernet switches: LAN switching 
  application 
   
  Broadcast and multicast services are available over traditional 
  LANs.  Sites that belong to the same broadcast domain and that are 
  connected via an MPLS network expect broadcast, multicast and 
  unicast traffic to be forwarded to the proper location(s).  This 
  requires MAC address learning/aging on a per pseudo-wire basis, 
  packet replication across pseudo-wires for multicast/broadcast 
  traffic and for flooding of unknown unicast destination traffic. 
   
  [PWE3-ETHERNET] defines how to carry Layer 2 (L2) frames over 
  point-to-point pseudo-wires (PW).  This document describes 
  extensions to [PWE3-CTRL] for transporting Ethernet/802.3 and VLAN 
  [802.1Q] traffic across multiple sites that belong to the same L2 
  broadcast domain or VPLS.  Note that the same model can be applied 
  to other 802.1 technologies.  It describes a simple and scalable 
  way to offer Virtual LAN services, including the appropriate 
  flooding of broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast destination 
  traffic over MPLS, without the need for address resolution servers 
  or other external servers, as discussed in [L2VPN-REQ]. 
   
  The following discussion applies to devices that are VPLS capable 
  and have a means of tunneling labeled packets amongst each other.

  The resulting set of interconnected devices forms a private MPLS 
  VPN. 
   
4. Topological Model for VPLS 
   
  An interface participating in a VPLS must be able to flood, 
  forward, and filter Ethernet frames.  The set of PE devices 
  interconnected via PWs appears as a single emulated LAN to customer 
  C1.  Each PE will form remote MAC address to PW associations and 
  associate directly attached MAC addresses to local customer facing 
  ports.  This is modeled on standard IEEE 802.1 MAC address 
  learning.

  We note here again that while this document shows specific examples 
  using MPLS transport tunnels, other tunnels that can be used by PWs 
  (as mentioned in [PWE-CTRL]), e.g., GRE, L2TP, IPSEC, etc., can 
  also be used, as long as the originating PE can be identified, 
  since this is used in the MAC learning process. 
   
  The scope of the VPLS lies within the PEs in the service provider 
  network, highlighting the fact that apart from customer service 
  delineation, the form of access to a customer site is not relevant 
  to the VPLS [L2VPN-REQ].  In other words, the access circuit (AC) 
  connected to the customer could be a physical Ethernet port, a 
  logical (tagged) Ethernet port, an ATM PVC carrying Ethernet 
  frames, etc., or even an Ethernet PW. 
   
  The PE is typically an edge router capable of running the LDP 
  signaling protocol and/or routing protocols to set up PWs.  In 
  addition, it is capable of setting up transport tunnels to other 
  PEs and delivering traffic over PWs. 
   
4.1. Flooding and Forwarding 
   
  One of attributes of an Ethernet service is that frames sent to 
  broadcast addresses and to unknown destination MAC addresses are 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                            [Page 4] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  flooded to all ports.  To achieve flooding within the service 
  provider network, all unknown unicast, broadcast and multicast 
  frames are flooded over the corresponding PWs to all PE nodes 
  participating in the VPLS, as well as to all ACs. 
   
  Note that multicast frames are a special case and do not 
  necessarily have to be sent to all VPN members.  For simplicity, 
  the default approach of broadcasting multicast frames can be used.  
  The use of IGMP snooping and PIM snooping techniques should be used 
  to improve multicast efficiency.  A description of these techniques 
  is beyond the scope of this document. 
   
  To forward a frame, a PE MUST be able to associate a destination 
  MAC address with a PW.  It is unreasonable and perhaps impossible 
  to require PEs to statically configure an association of every 
  possible destination MAC address with a PW.  Therefore, VPLS-
  capable PEs SHOULD have the capability to dynamically learn MAC 
  addresses on both ACs and PWs and to forward and replicate packets 
  across both ACs and PWs. 
   
4.2. Address Learning 
   
  Unlike BGP VPNs [BGP-VPN], reachability information is not 
  advertised and distributed via a control plane.  Reachability is 
  obtained by standard learning bridge functions in the data plane. 
   
  When a packet arrives on a PW, if the source MAC address is 
  unknown, it needs to be associated with the PW, so that outbound 
  packets to that MAC address can be delivered over the associated 
  PW.  Likewise, when a packet arrives on an AC, if the source MAC 
  address is unknown, it needs to be associated with the AC, so that 
  outbound packets to that MAC address can be delivered over the 
  associated AC. 
   
  Standard learning, filtering and forwarding actions, as defined in  
  [802.1D-ORIG], [802.1D-REV] and [802.1Q], are required when a PW or 
  AC state changes. 
   
4.3. Tunnel Topology 
   
  PE routers are assumed to have the capability to establish 
  transport tunnels.  Tunnels are set up between PEs to aggregate 
  traffic.  PWs are signaled to demultiplex encapsulated Ethernet 
  frames from multiple VPLS instances that traverse the transport 
  tunnels. 
   
  In an Ethernet L2VPN, it becomes the responsibility of the service 
  provider to create the loop free topology.  For the sake of 
  simplicity, we define that the topology of a VPLS is a full mesh of 
  PWs. 
   
   

    
  Lasserre, et al.                                            [Page 5] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
4.4. Loop free VPLS 
   
  If the topology of the VPLS is not restricted to a full mesh, then 
  it may be that for two PEs not directly connected via PWs, they 
  would have to use an intermediary PE to relay packets.  This 
  topology would require the use of some loop-breaking protocol, like 
  a spanning tree protocol. 
   
  Instead, a full mesh of PWs is established between PEs.  Since 
  every PE is now directly connected to every other PE in the VPLS 
  via a PW, there is no longer any need to relay packets, and we can 
  instantiate a simpler loop-breaking rule - the "split horizon" 
  rule: a PE MUST NOT forward traffic from one PW to another in the 
  same VPLS mesh. 
   
  Note that customers are allowed to run the Spanning Tree Protocol 
  (STP) such as when a customer has "back door" links used to provide 
  redundancy in the case of a failure within the VPLS.  In such a 
  case, STP Bridge PDUs (BPDUs) are simply tunneled through the 
  provider cloud. 
   
5. Discovery 
   
  The capability to manually configure the addresses of the remote 
  PEs is REQUIRED.  However, the use of manual configuration is not 
  necessary if an auto-discovery procedure is used.  A number of 
  auto-discovery procedures are compatible with this document 
  ([RADIUS-DISC], [BGP-DISC]). 
   
6. Control Plane 
   
  This document describes the control plane functions of signaling of 
  PW labels.  Some foundational work in the area of support for 
  multi-homing is laid.  The extensions to provide multi-homing 
  support should work independently of the basic VPLS operation, and 
  are not described here. 
   
6.1. LDP Based Signaling of Demultiplexers 
   
  A full mesh of LDP sessions is used to establish the mesh of PWs.  
  The requirement for a full mesh of PWs may result in a large number 
  of targeted LDP sessions.  Section 8 discusses the option of 
  setting up hierarchical topologies in order to minimize the size of 
  the VPLS full mesh. 
   
  Once an LDP session has been formed between two PEs, all PWs 
  between these two PEs are signaled over this session. 
   
  In [PWE3-CTRL], two types of FECs are described, the PWid FEC 
  Element (FEC type 128) and the Generalized PWid FEC Element (FEC 
  type 129).  The original FEC element used for VPLS was compatible 
  with the PWid FEC Element.  The text for signaling using PWid FEC 
  Element has been moved to Appendix 1.  What we describe below 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                            [Page 6] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  replaces that with a more generalized L2VPN descriptor, the 
  Generalized PWid FEC Element. 
   
6.1.1. Using the Generalized PWid FEC Element 
   
  [PWE3-CTRL] describes a generalized FEC structure that is be used 
  for VPLS signaling in the following manner.  We describe the 
  assignment of the Generalized PWid FEC Element fields in the 
  context of VPLS signaling. 
   
  Control bit (C): This bit is used to signal the use of the control 
  word as specified in [PWE3-CTRL]. 
   
  PW type: The allowed PW types are Ethernet (0x0005) and Ethernet 
  tagged mode (0x004) as specified in [IANA]. 
   
  VC info length: As specified in [PWE3-CTRL]. 
   
  AGI, Length, Value: The unique name of this VPLS.  The AGI 
  identifies a type of name, Length denotes the length of Value, 
  which is the name of the VPLS.  We use the term AGI interchangeably 
  with VPLS identifier. 
   
  TAII, SAII: These are null because the mesh of PWs in a VPLS 
  terminate on MAC learning tables, rather than on individual 
  attachment circuits.  The use of non-null TAII and SAII is reserved 
  for future enhancements. 
   
  Interface Parameters: The relevant interface parameters are: 
   
     - MTU: the MTU of the VPLS MUST be the same across all the PWs 
        in the mesh. 
   
     - Optional Description String: same as [PWE3-CTRL]. 
   
     - Requested VLAN ID: If the PW type is Ethernet tagged mode, 
        this parameter may be used to signal the insertion of the 
        appropriate VLAN ID as specified in section 6.1. 
   
6.2. MAC Address Withdrawal 
   
  It MAY be desirable to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have 
  been dynamically learned for faster convergence.  This is 
  accomplished by sending a MAC Address Withdraw Message with the 
  list of MAC addresses to be removed to all other PEs over the 
  corresponding LDP sessions. 
   
  We introduce an optional MAC List TLV that is used to specify a 
  list of MAC addresses that can be removed or unlearned using the 
  Address Withdraw Message. 
  The Address Withdraw message with MAC TLVs MAY be supported in 
  order to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result of a 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                            [Page 7] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  topology change (e.g., failure of the primary link for a dual-homed 
  MTU-s). 
   
  In order to minimize the impact on LDP convergence time, when the 
  MAC list TLV contains a large number of MAC addresses, it may be 
  preferable to send a MAC address withdrawal message with an empty 
  list. 
   
6.2.1. MAC List TLV 
   
  MAC addresses to be unlearned can be signaled using an LDP Address 
  Withdraw Message that contains a new TLV, the MAC List TLV.  Its 
  format is described below.  The encoding of a MAC List TLV address 
  is the 6-byte MAC address specified by IEEE 802 documents [g-ORIG] 
  [802.1D-REV].

  U bit: Unknown bit.  This bit MUST be set to 1.  If the MAC address 
  format is not understood, then the TLV is not understood, and MUST 
  be ignored. 
   
  F bit: Forward bit.  This bit MUST be set to 0.  Since the LDP 
  mechanism used here is targeted, the TLV MUST NOT be forwarded. 
   
  Type: Type field.  This field MUST be set to 0x0404 (subject to 
  IANA approval).  This identifies the TLV type as MAC List TLV. 
   
  Length: Length field.  This field specifies the total length of the 
  MAC addresses in the TLV. 
   
  MAC Address: The MAC address(es) being removed. 
   
  The MAC Address Withdraw Message contains a FEC TLV (to identify 
  the VPLS in consideration), a MAC Address TLV and optional 
  parameters.  No optional parameters have been defined for the MAC 
  Address Withdraw signaling.  Note that if a PE receives a MAC 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                            [Page 8] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  Address Withdraw Message and does not understand it, it MUST ignore 
  the message.  In this case, instead of flushing its MAC address 
  table, it will continue to use stale information, unless: 
   
     - it receives a packet with a known MAC address association, 
        but from a different PW, in which case it replaces the old 
        association, or 
     - it ages out the old association 
   
  The MAC Address Withdraw message only helps to speed up 
  convergence, so PEs that do not understand the message can continue 
  to participate in the VPLS. 
   
6.2.2. Address Withdraw Message Containing MAC TLV 
   
  The processing for MAC List TLV received in an Address Withdraw 
  Message is: 
   
  For each MAC address in the TLV: 
     - Remove the association between the MAC address and the AC or 
        PW over which this message is received 
   
  For a MAC Address Withdraw message with empty list: 
     - Remove all the MAC addresses associated with the VPLS 
        instance  (specified by the FEC TLV) except the MAC addresses 
        learned over the PW associated with this signaling session 
        over which the message was received 
   
  The scope of a MAC List TLV is the VPLS specified in the FEC TLV in 
  the MAC Address Withdraw Message.  The number of MAC addresses can 
  be deduced from the length field in the TLV. 
   
7. Data Forwarding on an Ethernet PW 
   
  This section describes the data plane behavior on an Ethernet  
  PW used in a VPLS.  While the encapsulation is similar to that 
  described in [PWE3-ETHERNET], the NSP functions of stripping the 
  service-delimiting tag and using a "normalized" Ethernet frame are 
  described. 
   
7.1. VPLS Encapsulation actions 
   
  In a VPLS, a customer Ethernet frame without preamble is 
  encapsulated with a header as defined in [PWE3-ETHERNET].  A 
  customer Ethernet frame is defined as follows: 
   
     - If the frame, as it arrives at the PE, has an encapsulation 
        that is used by the local PE as a service delimiter, i.e., to 
        identify the customer and/or the particular service of that 
        customer, then that encapsulation may be stripped before the 
        frame is sent into the VPLS.  As the frame exits the VPLS, 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                            [Page 9] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
        the frame may have a service-delimiting encapsulation 
        inserted. 
   
     - If the frame, as it arrives at the PE, has an encapsulation 
        that is not service delimiting, then it is a customer frame 
        whose encapsulation should not be modified by the VPLS.  This 
        covers, for example, a frame that carries customer-specific 
        VLAN tags that the service provider neither knows about nor 
        wants to modify. 
   
  As an application of these rules, a customer frame may arrive at a 
  customer-facing port with a VLAN tag that identifies the customer's 
  VPLS instance.  That tag would be stripped before it is 
  encapsulated in the VPLS.  At egress, the frame may be tagged 
  again, if a service-delimiting tag is used, or it may be untagged 
  if none is used. 
   
  Likewise, if a customer frame arrives at a customer-facing port 
  over an ATM or Frame Relay VC that identifies the customer's VPLS 
  instance, then the ATM or FR encapsulation is removed before the 
  frame is passed into the VPLS. 
   
  Contrariwise, if a customer frame arrives at a customer-facing port 
  with a VLAN tag that identifies a VLAN domain in the customer L2 
  network, then the tag is not modified or stripped, as it belongs 
  with the rest of the customer frame. 
   
  By following the above rules, the Ethernet frame that traverses a 
  VPLS is always a customer Ethernet frame.  Note that the two 
  actions, at ingress and egress, of dealing with service delimiters 
  are local actions that neither PE has to signal to the other.  They 
  allow, for example, a mix-and-match of VLAN tagged and untagged 
  services at either end, and do not carry across a VPLS a VLAN tag 
  that has local significance only.  The service delimiter may be an 
  MPLS label also, whereby an Ethernet PW given by [PWE3-ETHERNET] 
  can serve as the access side connection into a PE.  An RFC1483 
  Bridged PVC encapsulation could also serve as a service delimiter.  
  By limiting the scope of locally significant encapsulations to the 
  edge, hierarchical VPLS models can be developed that provide the 
  capability to network-engineer scalable VPLS deployments, as 
  described below. 
   
7.2. VPLS Learning actions 
   
  Learning is done based on the customer Ethernet frame as defined 
  above.  The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) keeps track of the 
  mapping of customer Ethernet frame addressing and the appropriate 
  PW to use.  We define two modes of learning: qualified and 
  unqualified learning. 
   


    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 10] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  In unqualified learning, all the VLANs of a single customer are 
  handled by a single VPLS, which means they all share a single 
  broadcast domain and a single MAC address space.  This means that 
  MAC addresses need to be unique and non-overlapping among customer 
  VLANs or else they cannot be differentiated within the VPLS 
  instance and this can result in loss of customer frames.  An 
  application of unqualified learning is port-based VPLS service for 
  a given customer (e.g., customer with non-multiplexed AC where all 
  the traffic on a physical port, which may include multiple customer 
  VLANs, is mapped to a single VPLS instance). 
   
  In qualified learning, each customer VLAN is assigned to its own 
  VPLS instance, which means each customer VLAN has its own broadcast 
  domain and MAC address space.  Therefore, in qualified learning, 
  MAC addresses among customer VLANs may overlap with each other, but 
  they will be handled correctly since each customer VLAN has its own 
  FIB, i.e., each customer VLAN has its own MAC address space.  Since 
  VPLS broadcasts multicast frames by default, qualified learning 
  offers the advantage of limiting the broadcast scope to a given 
  customer VLAN.  Qualified learning can result in large FIB table 
  sizes, because the logical MAC address is now a VLAN tag + MAC 
  address. 
   
  For STP to work in qualified mode, a VPLS PE must be able to 
  forward STP BPDUs over the proper VPLS instance.  In a hierarchical 
  VPLS case (see details in Section 10), service delimiting tags (Q-
  in-Q or [PWE3-ETHERNET]) can be added by MTU-s nodes such that PEs 
  can unambiguously identify all customer traffic, including STP/MSTP 
  BPDUs.  In a basic VPLS case, upstream switches must insert such 
  service delimiting tags.  When an access port is shared among 
  multiple customers, a reserved VLAN per customer domain must be 
  used to carry STP/MSTP traffic.  The STP/MSTP frames are 
  encapsulated with a unique provider tag per customer (as the 
  regular customer traffic), and a PEs looks up the provider tag to 
  send such frames across the proper VPLS instance. 
   
8. Data Forwarding on an Ethernet VLAN PW 
   
  This section describes the data plane behavior on an Ethernet VLAN 
  PW in a VPLS.  While the encapsulation is similar to that described 
  in [PWE3-ETHERNET], the NSP functions of imposing tags and using a 
  "normalized" Ethernet frame are described.  The learning behavior 
  is the same as for Ethernet PWs. 
       
8.1. VPLS Encapsulation actions 
   
  In a VPLS, a customer Ethernet frame without preamble is 
  encapsulated with a header as defined in [PWE3-ETHERNET].  A 
  customer Ethernet frame is defined as follows: 
   
     - If the frame, as it arrives at the PE, has an encapsulation 
        that is part of the customer frame, and is also used by the 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 11] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
        local PE as a service delimiter, i.e., to identify the 
        customer and/or the particular service of that customer, then 
        that encapsulation is preserved as the frame is sent into the 
        VPLS, unless the Requested VLAN ID optional parameter was 
        signaled.  In that case, the VLAN tag is overwritten before 
        the frame is sent out on the PW. 
   
     - If the frame, as it arrives at the PE, has an encapsulation 
        that does not have the required VLAN tag, a null tag is 
        imposed if the Requested VLAN ID optional parameter was not 
        signaled. 
   
  As an application of these rules, a customer frame may arrive at a 
  customer-facing port with a VLAN tag that identifies the customer's 
  VPLS instance and also identifies a customer VLAN.  That tag would 
  be preserved as it is encapsulated in the VPLS. 
   
  The Ethernet VLAN PW provides a simple way to preserve customer 
  802.1p bits. 
   
  A VPLS MAY have both Ethernet and Ethernet VLAN PWs.  However, if a 
  PE is not able to support both PWs simultaneously, it SHOULD send a 
  Label Release on the PW messages that it cannot support with a 
  status code "Unknown FEC" as given in [RFC3036]. 
   
9. Operation of a VPLS 
   
  We show here an example of how a VPLS works.  The following 
  discussion uses the figure below, where a VPLS has been set up 
  between PE1, PE2 and PE3. 
   
                                                           -----

            | A2 CE2-      /        \     /       PE1     \     / 
            \    /   \    /          \---/         \       ----- 
             ----     ---PE2                        | 
                         | Service Provider Network | 
                          \          /   \         / 
                   -----  PE3       /     \       / 
                   |Agg|_/  --------       ------- 
                  -|   | 
           ----  / -----  ---- 
          /    \/    \   /    \             CE = Customer Edge Router 
          | A3 CE3    --C4 A4 |             PE = Provider Edge Router 
          \    /         \    /             Agg = Layer 2 Aggregation 
           ----           ---- 
   
  Initially, the VPLS is set up so that PE1, PE2 and PE3 have a full 
  mesh of Ethernet PWs.  The VPLS instance is assigned a identifier 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 12] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  (AGI).  For the above example, say PE1 signals PW label 102 to PE2 
  and 103 to PE3, and PE2 signals PW label 201 to PE1 and 203 to PE3. 
   
  Assume a packet from A1 is bound for A2.  When it leaves CE1, say 
  it has a source MAC address of M1 and a destination MAC of M2.  If 
  PE1 does not know where M2 is, it will flood the packet, i.e., send 
  it to PE2 and PE3.  When PE2 receives the packet, it will have a PW 
  label of 201.  PE2 can conclude that the source MAC address M1 is 
  behind PE1, since it distributed the label 201 to PE1.  It can 
  therefore associate MAC address M1 with PW label 102. 
   
9.1. MAC Address Aging 
   
  PEs that learn remote MAC addresses SHOULD have an aging mechanism 
  to remove unused entries associated with a PW label.  This is 
  important both for conservation of memory as well as for 
  administrative purposes.  For example, if a customer site A is shut 
  down, eventually, the other PEs should unlearn A's MAC address. 
   
  The aging timer for MAC address M SHOULD be reset when a packet 
  with source MAC address M is received. 
   
10. A Hierarchical VPLS Model 
   
  The solution described above requires a full mesh of tunnel LSPs 
  between all the PE routers that participate in the VPLS service.   
  For each VPLS service, n*(n-1)/2 PWs must be setup between the PE 
  routers.  While this creates signaling overhead, the real detriment 
  to large scale deployment is the packet replication requirements 
  for each provisioned PWs on a PE router.  Hierarchical 
  connectivity, described in this document reduces signaling and 
  replication overhead to allow large scale deployment. 
   
  In many cases, service providers place smaller edge devices in 
  multi-tenant buildings and aggregate them into a PE in a large 
  Central Office (CO) facility.  In some instances, standard IEEE 
  802.1q (Dot 1Q) tagging techniques may be used to facilitate 
  mapping CE interfaces to VPLS access circuits at a PE. 
   
  It is often beneficial to extend the VPLS service tunneling 
  techniques into the MTU (multi-tenant unit) domain.  This can be 
  accomplished by treating the MTU as a PE and provisioning PWs 
  between it and every other edge, as a basic VPLS.  An alternative 
  is to utilize [PWE3-ETHERNET] PWs or Q-in-Q logical interfaces 
  between the MTU and selected VPLS enabled PE routers.  Q-in-Q 
  encapsulation is another form of L2 tunneling technique, which can 
  be used in conjunction with MPLS signaling as will be described 
  later.  The following two sections focus on this alternative 
  approach.  The VPLS core PWs (hub) are augmented with access PWs 
  (spoke) to form a two-tier hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS). 
   
  Spoke PWs may be implemented using any L2 tunneling mechanism, 
  expanding the scope of the first tier to include non-bridging VPLS 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 13]

  PE routers.  The non-bridging PE router would extend a spoke PW 
  from a Layer-2 switch that connects to it, through the service core 
  network, to a bridging VPLS PE router supporting hub PWs.  We also 
  describe how VPLS-challenged nodes and low-end CEs without MPLS 
  capabilities may participate in a hierarchical VPLS. 
   
10.1. Hierarchical connectivity 
   
  This section describes the hub and spoke connectivity model and 
  describes the requirements of the bridging capable and non-bridging 
  MTU devices for supporting the spoke connections.  For rest of this 
  discussion we refer to a bridging capable MTU as MTU-s and a non-
  bridging capable PE as PE-r.  We refer to a routing and bridging 
  capable device as PE-rs.

  In the figure above where an MTU-s has a single connection to a PE-
  rs placed in the CO.  The PE-rs devices are connected in a basic 
  VPLS full mesh.  For each VPLS service, a single spoke PW is set up 
  between the MTU-s and the PE-rs based on [PWE3-CTRL].  Unlike 
  traditional PWs that terminate on a physical (or a VLAN-tagged 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 14] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  logical) port, a spoke PW terminates on a virtual switch instance 
  (VSI, see [L2FRAME]) on the MTU-s and the PE-rs devices. 
   
  The MTU-s and the PE-rs treat each spoke connection like an AC of 
  the VPLS service.  The PW label is used to associate the traffic 
  from the spoke to a VPLS instance. 
   
10.1.1.1. MTU-s Operation 
   
  An MTU-s is defined as a device that supports layer-2 switching 
  functionality and does all the normal bridging functions of 
  learning and replication on all its ports, including the spoke, 
  which is treated as a virtual port.  Packets to unknown 
  destinations are replicated to all ports in the service including 
  the spoke.  Once the MAC address is learned, traffic between CE1 
  and CE2 will be switched locally by the MTU-s saving the capacity 
  of the spoke to the PE-rs.  Similarly traffic between CE1 or CE2 
  and any remote destination is switched directly on to the spoke and 
  sent to the PE-rs over the point-to-point PW. 
   
  Since the MTU-s is bridging capable, only a single PW is required 
  per VPLS instance for any number of access connections in the same 
  VPLS service.  This further reduces the signaling overhead between 
  the MTU-s and PE-rs. 
   
  If the MTU-s is directly connected to the PE-rs, other 
  encapsulation techniques such as Q-in-Q can be used for the spoke. 
       
10.1.1.2. PE-rs Operation 
   
  A PE-rs is a device that supports all the bridging functions for 
  VPLS service and supports the routing and MPLS encapsulation, i.e., 
  it supports all the functions described for a basic VPLS as 
  described above. 
   
  The operation of PE-rs is independent of the type of device at the 
  other end of the spoke.  Thus, the spoke from the MTU-s is treated 
  as a virtual port and the PE-rs will switch traffic between the 
  spoke PW, hub PWs, and ACs once it has learned the MAC addresses. 
   
10.1.2. Advantages of spoke connectivity 
   
  Spoke connectivity offers several scaling and operational 
  advantages for creating large scale VPLS implementations, while 
  retaining the ability to offer all the functionality of the VPLS 
  service. 
     - Eliminates the need for a full mesh of tunnels and full mesh 
        of PWs per service between all devices participating in the 
        VPLS service. 
     - Minimizes signaling overhead since fewer PWs are required for 
        the VPLS service. 

    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 15] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
     - Segments VPLS nodal discovery.  MTU-s needs to be aware of 
        only the PE-rs node although it is participating in the VPLS 
        service that spans multiple devices.  On the other hand, 
        every VPLS PE-rs must be aware of every other VPLS PE-rs and 
        all of its locally connected MTU-s and PE-r devices. 
     - Addition of other sites requires configuration of the new 
        MTU-s but does not require any provisioning of the existing 
        MTU-s devices on that service. 
     - Hierarchical connections can be used to create VPLS service 
        that spans multiple service provider domains.  This is 
        explained in a later section. 
   
  Note that as more devices participate in the VPLS, there are more 
  devices that require the capability for learning and replication. 
   
10.1.3. Spoke connectivity for non-bridging devices 
   
  In some cases, a bridging PE-rs may not be deployed in a CO or a 
  multi-tenant building, or a PE-r might already be deployed.  In 
  this section, we explain how a PE-r that does not support any of 
  the VPLS bridging functionality can participate in the VPLS 
  service.  As shown in this figure, the PE-r creates a point-to-
  point tunnel LSP to a PE-rs.

  Then for every access port that needs to participate in a VPLS 
  service, the PE-r creates a point-to-point PW that terminates on 
  the physical port at the PE-r and terminates on the VSI of the VPLS 
  service at the PE-rs. 
   
  The PE-r is defined as a device that supports routing but does not 
  support any bridging functions.  However, it is capable of setting 
  up PWs between itself and the PE-rs.  For every port that is 
  supported in the VPLS service, a PW is setup from the PE-r to the 
  PE-rs.  Once the PWs are setup, there is no learning or replication 
  function required on the part of the PE-r.  All traffic received on 
  any of the ACs is transmitted on the PW.  Similarly all traffic 
  received on a PW is transmitted to the AC where the PW terminates.  
  Thus traffic from CE1 destined for CE2 is switched at PE1-rs and 
  not at PE-r. 
   
  Note that in the case where PE-r devices use Provider VLANs (P-
  VLAN) as demultiplexers instead of PWs, PE1-rs can treat them as 
  such and map these "circuits" into a VPLS domain to provide 
  bridging support between them. 
   
  This approach adds more overhead than the bridging capable (MTU-s) 
  spoke approach since a PW is required for every AC that 
  participates in the service versus a single PW required per service 
  (regardless of ACs) when an MTU-s is used.  However, this approach 
  offers the advantage of offering a VPLS service in conjunction with 
  a routed internet service without requiring the addition of new 
  MTU. 
   
10.2. Redundant Spoke Connections 
   
  An obvious weakness of the hub and spoke approach described thus 
  far is that the MTU has a single connection to the PE-rs.  In case 
  of failure of the connection or the PE-rs, the MTU suffers total 
  loss of connectivity. 
   
  In this section we describe how the redundant connections can be 
  provided to avoid total loss of connectivity from the MTU.  The 
  mechanism described is identical for both, MTU-s and PE-r devices. 
   
10.2.1. Dual-homed MTU 
   
  To protect from connection failure of the PW or the failure of the 
  PE-rs, the MTU-s or the PE-r is dual-homed into two PE-rs devices, 
  as shown in figure-3.  The PE-rs devices must be part of the same 
  VPLS service instance. 
   
  An MTU-s can set up two PWs (one each to PE1-rs and PE3-rs) for 
  each VPLS instance.  One of the two PWs is designated as primary 
  and is the one that is actively used under normal conditions, while 
  the second PW is designated as secondary and is held in a standby 
  state.  The MTU negotiates the PW labels for both the primary and 
  secondary PWs, but does not use the secondary PW unless the primary

  PW fails.  How a spoke is designated primary or secondary is 
  outside of the scope of this document.  For example, a spanning 
  tree instance running between only the MTU and the two PE-rs nodes 
  is one possible method.  Another method could be configuration.

10.2.2. Failure detection and recovery 
   
  The MTU-s should control the usage of the spokes to the PE-rs 
  devices.  If the spokes are PWs, then LDP signaling is used to 
  negotiate the PW labels, and the hello messages used for the LDP 
  session could be used to detect failure of the primary PW.  The use 
  of other mechanisms which could provide faster detection failures 
  is outside the scope of this document. 
   
  Upon failure of the primary PW, MTU-s immediately switches to the 
  secondary PW.  At this point the PE3-rs that terminates the 
  secondary PW starts learning MAC addresses on the spoke PW.  All 
  other PE-rs nodes in the network think that CE-1 and CE-2 are 
  behind PE1-rs and may continue to send traffic to PE1-rs until they 
  learn that the devices are now behind PE3-rs.  The unlearning 
  process can take a long time and may adversely affect the 
  connectivity of higher level protocols from CE1 and CE2.  To enable 
  faster convergence, the PE3-rs where the secondary PW got activated 
  may send out a flush message (as explained in section 4.2), using 
  the MAC TLV as defined in Section 6, to all PE-rs nodes.  Upon 
  receiving the message, PE-rs nodes flush the MAC addresses 
  associated with that VPLS instance.

10.3. Multi-domain VPLS service 
   
  Hierarchy can also be used to create a large scale VPLS service 
  within a single domain or a service that spans multiple domains 
  without requiring full mesh connectivity between all VPLS capable 
  devices.  Two fully meshed VPLS networks are connected together 
  using a single LSP tunnel between the VPLS "border" devices.  A 
  single spoke PW per VPLS service is set up to connect the two 
  domains together. 
   
  When more than two domains need to be connected, a full mesh of 
  inter-domain spokes is created between border PEs.  Forwarding 
  rules over this mesh are identical to the rules defined in section 
  5. 
   
  This creates a three-tier hierarchical model that consists of a 
  hub-and-spoke topology between MTU-s and PE-rs devices, a full-mesh 
  topology between PE-rs, and a full mesh of inter-domain spokes 
  between border PE-rs devices. 
   
  This document does not specify how redundant border PEs per domain 
  per VPLS instance can be supported. 
   
11. Hierarchical VPLS model using Ethernet Access Network 
   
  In this section the hierarchical model is expanded to include an 
  Ethernet access network.  This model retains the hierarchical 
  architecture discussed previously in that it leverages the full-
  mesh topology among PE-rs devices; however, no restriction is 
  imposed on the topology of the Ethernet access network (e.g., the 
  topology between MTU-s and PE-rs devices is not restricted to hub 
  and spoke). 
   
  The motivation for an Ethernet access network is that Ethernet-
  based networks are currently deployed by some service providers to 
  offer VPLS services to their customers.  Therefore, it is important 
  to provide a mechanism that allows these networks to integrate with 
  an IP or MPLS core to provide scalable VPLS services. 
   
  One approach of tunneling a customer's Ethernet traffic via an 
  Ethernet access network is to add an additional VLAN tag to the 
  customer's data (which may be either tagged or untagged).  The 
  additional tag is referred to as Provider's VLAN (P-VLAN).  Inside 
  the provider's network each P-VLAN designates a customer or more 
  specifically a VPLS instance for that customer.  Therefore, there 
  is a one-to-one correspondence between a P-VLAN and a VPLS 
  instance.  In this model, the MTU-s needs to have the capability of 
  adding the additional P-VLAN tag to non-multiplexed ACs where 
  customer VLANs are not used as service delimiters.  This 
  functionality is described in [802.1ad]. 
   

    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 19] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
  If customer VLANs need to be treated as service delimiters (e.g., 
  the AC is a multiplexed port), then the MTU-s needs to have the 
  additional capability of translating a customer VLAN (C-VLAN) to a 
  P-VLAN, or push an additional P-VLAN tag, in order to resolve 
  overlapping VLAN tags used by different customers.  Therefore, the 
  MTU-s in this model can be considered as a typical bridge with this 
  additional capability.  This functionality is described in 
  [802.1ad]. 
   
  The PE-rs needs to be able to perform bridging functionality over 
  the standard Ethernet ports toward the access network as well as 
  over the PWs toward the network core.  In this model, the PE-rs may 
  need to run STP towards the access network, in addition to split-
  horizon over the MPLS core.  The PE-rs needs to map a P-VLAN to a 
  VPLS-instance and its associated PWs and vice versa. 
   
  The details regarding bridge operation for MTU-s and PE-rs (e.g., 
  encapsulation format for Q-in-Q messages, customer's Ethernet 
  control protocol handling, etc.) are outside of the scope of this 
  document and they are covered in [802.1ad].  However, the relevant 
  part is the interaction between the bridge module and the MPLS/IP 
  PWs in the PE-rs, which behaves just as in a regular VPLS. 
   
11.1. Scalability 
   
  Since each P-VLAN corresponds to a VPLS instance, the total number 
  of VPLS instances supported is limited to 4K.  The P-VLAN serves as 
  a local service delimiter within the provider's network that is 
  stripped as it gets mapped to a PW in a VPLS instance.  Therefore, 
  the 4K limit applies only within an Ethernet access network 
  (Ethernet island) and not to the entire network.  The SP network 
  consists of a core MPLS/IP network that connects many Ethernet 
  islands.  Therefore, the number of VPLS instances can scale 
  accordingly with the number of Ethernet islands (a metro region can 
  be represented by one or more islands). 
   
11.2. Dual Homing and Failure Recovery 
   
  In this model, an MTU-s can be dual homed to different devices 
  (aggregators and/or PE-rs devices).  The failure protection for 
  access network nodes and links can be provided through running MSTP 
  in each island.  The MSTP of each island is independent from other 
  islands and do not interact with each other.  If an island has more 
  than one PE-rs, then a dedicated full-mesh of PWs is used among 
  these PE-rs devices for carrying the SP BPDU packets for that 
  island.  On a per P-VLAN basis, MSTP will designate a single PE-rs 
  to be used for carrying the traffic across the core.  The loop-free 
  protection through the core is performed using split-horizon and 
  the failure protection in the core is performed through standard 
  IP/MPLS re-routing.

15. Security Considerations 
   
  A more comprehensive description of the security issues involved in  
  L2VPNs is covered in [VPN-SEC].  An unguarded VPLS service is 
  vulnerable to some security issues which pose risks to the customer 
  and provider networks.  Most of the security issues can be avoided 
  through implementation of appropriate guards.  A couple of them can 
  be prevented through existing protocols. 
   
     - Data plane aspects 
    
  Lasserre, et al.                                           [Page 21] 
   
  Internet Draft      Virtual Private LAN Service            July 2005 
 
          - Traffic isolation between VPLS domains is guaranteed by 
            the use of per VPLS L2 FIB table and the use of per VPLS 
            PWs 
          - The customer traffic, which consists of Ethernet frames, 
            is carried unchanged over VPLS.  If security is 
            required, the customer traffic SHOULD be encrypted 
            and/or authenticated before entering the service 
            provider network 
          - Preventing broadcast storms can be achieved by using 
            routers as CPE devices or by rate policing the amount of 
            broadcast traffic that customers can send 
     - Control plane aspects 
          - LDP security (authentication) methods as described in 
            [RFC-3036] SHOULD be applied.  This would prevent 
            unauthenticated messages from disrupting a PE in a VPLS 
     - Denial of service attacks 
          - Some means to limit the number of MAC addresses (per site 
            per VPLS) that a PE can learn SHOULD be implemented 
   
16. IANA Considerations 
   
  The type field in the MAC TLV is defined as 0x404 in section 4.2.1 
  and is subject to IANA approval.

18. Appendix: VPLS Signaling using the PWid FEC Element 
   
  This section is being retained because live deployments use this 
  version of the signaling for VPLS. 
   
  The VPLS signaling information is carried in a Label Mapping 
  message sent in downstream unsolicited mode, which contains the 
  following VC FEC TLV. 
   
  VC, C, VC Info Length, Group ID, Interface parameters are as 
  defined in [PWE3-CTRL]. 
   
  We use the Ethernet PW type to identify PWs that carry Ethernet 
  traffic for multipoint connectivity.

  In a VPLS, we use a VCID (which, when using the PWid FEC, has been 
  substituted with a more general identifier (AGI), to address 
  extending the scope of a VPLS) to identify an emulated LAN segment.  
  Note that the VCID as specified in [PWE3-CTRL] is a service 
  identifier, identifying a service emulating a point-to-point 
  virtual circuit.  In a VPLS, the VCID is a single service 
  identifier, so it has global significance across all PEs involved 
  in the VPLS instance.
