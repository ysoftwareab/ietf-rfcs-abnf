     SR Policies for Path Segment and Bidirectional Path in BGP-LS
             draft-li-idr-bgp-ls-sr-policy-path-segment-01

Abstract

   This document specifies the way of collecting configuration and
   states of SR policies carrying Path Segment and bidirectional path
   information by using BPG-LS.  Such information can be used by
   external conponents for many use cases such as performance
   measurement, path re-optimization and end-to-end protection.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that
   allows the ingress node steers packets into a specific path according
   to the Segment Routing Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   However, the SR Policies defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] only supports unidirectional
   SR paths and there is no path ID in a Segment List to identify an SR
   path.  For identifying an SR path and supporting bidirectional path
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment], new policies carrying Path
   Segment and bidirectional path information are defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution], as well as the
   extensions to BGP to distribute new SR policies.  The Path Segment
   can be a Path Segment in SR-MPLS [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment]
   , or a Path Segment in SRv6 [I-D.li-spring-srv6-path-segment], or
   other IDs that can identify a path.

Internet-Draft  Path ID and Bi-directional Path in BGP-LS   October 2018


   In many network scenarios, the configuration and state of each TE
   Policy is required by a controller which allows the network operator
   to optimize several functions and operations through the use of a
   controller aware of both topology and state information
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution].

   To collect the TE Policy information that is locally available in a
   router, [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] describes a new mechanism
   by using BGP-LS update messages.

   Based on the mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution],
   this document describes a mechanism to distribute configuration and
   states of the new SR policies defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to external
   components using BGP-LS.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8402] and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution].

3.  Carrying SR Path Sub-TLVs in BGP-LS

   A mechanism to collect states of SR Policies via BGP-LS is proposed
   by [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution].  The characteristics of an SR
   policy can be described by a TE Policy State TLV, which is carried in
   the optional non-transitive BGP Attribute "LINK_STATE Attribute"
   defined in [RFC7752].  The TE Policy State TLV contains several sub-
   TLVs such as SR TE Policy sub-TLVs.  Rather than replicating SR TE
   Policy sub-TLVs, [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] reuses the
   equivalent sub-TLVs as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

   As defined in [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution], the
   new SR policies for bidirectional path has the following format:

             Figure 1. SR policy for Bidirectional path

   For collecting configuration and states of unidirectional and
   bidirectional SR policies defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution], new sub-TLVs in SR
   TE Policy sub-TLVs should be defined.  Likewise, rather than
   replicating SR Policy sub-TLVs, this document can reuse the
   equivalent sub-TLVs as defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].

3.1.  SR Path Segment Sub-TLV

   This section reuses the SR Path Segment sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to describe a Path
   Segment , and it can be included in the Segment List sub-TLV as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] . An SR Path Segment
   sub-TLV can be associated with an SR path specified by a Segment List
   sub-TLV, and it MUST appear only once within a Segment List sub-TLV.
   Also, it can be used for identifying an SR candidate path or an SR
   Policy defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   The format of Path Segment TLV is included below for reference.

   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].

3.2.  Sub-TLVs for Bidirectional Path

   In some scenarios like mobile backhaul transport network, there are
   requirements to support bidirectional path.  In SR, a bidirectional
   path can be represented as a binding of two unidirectional SR paths
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment].
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] defines new sub-TLVs
   to describe an SR bidirectional path.  An SR policy carrying SR
   bidirectional path information is expressed in Figure 1.

3.2.1.  SR Bidirectional Path Sub-TLV

   This section reuses the SR bidirectional path sub-TLV defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to specify a
   bidirectional path, which contains a Segment List sub-TLV
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] and an associated Reverse
   Path Segment List as defined in
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution].  The SR
   bidirectional path sub-TLV has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

3.2.2.  SR Reverse Path Segment List Sub-TLV

   This section reuses the SR Reverse Path Segment List sub-TLV defined
   in [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] to specify an
   reverse SR path associated with the path specified by the Segment
   List in the same SR Bidirectional Path Sub-TLV, and it has the
   following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

4.  Operations

   No new operation procedures are defined in this document, the
   operations procedures of [RFC7752] can apply to this document.

   Typically but not limited to, the uni/bidirectional SR policies
   carrying path identification information can be distributed by the
   ingress node.

   Generally, BGP-LS is used for collecting link states and
   synchronizing with the external component.  The consumer of the uni/
   bidirectional SR policies carrying path identification information is
   not BGP LS process by itself, and it can be any applications such as
   performance measurement [I-D.gandhi-spring-udp-pm] and path re-
   coputation or re-optimization, etc.  The operation of sending
   information to other precesses is out of scope of this document.
