Internet-Draft           IPv6 over IEEE 802.16e             October 2005


1.  Introduction

   New Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) technology based on IEEE
   802.16e has begun to attract much attention in industry.  This is
   becoming a burning issue, and one of the key technologies which
   raises how to provide Internet access to mobile users.

   IEEE 802.16 specifies a new air interface and medium access control
   (MAC) protocol and provides high data rate as well as large cell
   coverage.  In addition, IEEE 802.16e provides seamless mobility so
   that mobile users can use wireless Internet services while they are
   moving on vehicles.

   This document intruduces a network structure for IEEE 802.16e and
   IPv6 deployment scenario over the network structure.  With the
   respect of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), this document describes
   requirements and considerations for deploying IPv6.  It helps for
   enterprise administrators to refine their deployment scenarios and to
   make plans of deploying IPv6-based services.


2.  Terminology

   This draft is based on the terminology defined in IEEE 802.16  and
   IEEE 802.16e .

   Subscriber station (SS):

      A generalized equipment set providing connectivity between
      subscriber equipment and a base station (BS).

   Mobile station (MS):

      A station in the mobile service intended to be used while in
      motion or during halts at unspecified points.  A mobile station
      (MS) is always a subscriber station (SS) unless specifically
      excepted otherwise in this document.

   Base station (BS):

      A generalized equipment set providing connectivity, management,
      and control of the subscriber station (SS).

      A BS consists of one AR and several RASs.

   AR: Access Router

   RAS: Radio Access Station

   ER: Edge router


3.  Mobile Broadband  Wireless Network Structure

   The network structure is shown in Fig. 1.  Backbone Network consists
   of core routers, ERs, etc.  A ER and a BS are connected directly.
   The BS consists of one AR and several RASs.

   Main functions of a BS are as follow:

   - Managing mobility of MS

   - Generating AAA information and sending them to AAA server

   - Supporting session connection, continuity and disconnection.

   These functions can be either handled in AR or in RAS according to
   implementation policy.

4.  IPv6 deployment scenario over Mobile Broadband  Wireless Access
    Network(IEEE 802.16e)

   IPv6 service should be provided without affecting IPv4 service.  An
   ISP can prepare IPv6 deployment by following three phases.


4.1  Phase 1

   In phase 1, Mobile Broadband  Wireless Access(MBWA) Internet Service
   is launched based on IPv4.  While backbone network equipments (core
   routers, etc) support IPv4-only, new access network equipments (BSs
   and ERs) support IPv6 with dual stack.  However dual stack in access
   network equipments is not enabled during phase 1.  Tunneling protocol
   among ERs is defined but not be used.  In this phase, the network
   delivers IPv4 traffic only.  And MSs are based on IPv4.

4.2  Phase 2

   In phase 2, the ISP starts offering IPv6 service over MBWA.

   Access network equipments and ERs enable IPv4/IPv6 dualstack.  IPv4
   and IPv6 traffic is delivered independantly.  IPv4 traffic is
   delivered as same as in phase 1.  IPv6 traffic is delivered through
   tunnels between ERs in backbone network. because, core routers in the
   backbone network does not support IPv6.

   Before phase 2, mobility management protocol for IPv6 should be
   decided and be prepared for its requirements.

   - Link extention for Generic IP , Mobile IP, etc.

   - Home agent

   o Deployment or not

   o Requirements

   o Management of HAs

   We assume some MSs support IPv4/IPv6 dual stack.

4.3  Phase 3

   In phase 3, the ISP provides stable IPv6 service.  Core routers in
   backbone network deliver IPv6 traffic without IPv4-IPv6 tunneling
   protocol.  IPv4/IPv6 dual stack is enabled not only in edge routers
   but also in core routers.  IPv4/IPv6 dual stack in BSs is enabled
   too.  There are IPv4-only MSs, IPv4/IPv6 dual stack MSs and IPv6-olny
   MSs.

5.  Considerations

   Some issues arise when implementing IPv6 over IEEE 802.16e.  With the
   respect of ISPs, these can be devided into two main topics.


5.1  Mobility management aspect

   - Location management(location update)

   Identifying MS exact location is a key factor of location based
   services which will be one of the major service in the near future.
   Reducing control signals for location update are also important.
   Network Mobility (NEMO) and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 protocol
   (HMIPv6) will be useful for location management.

   - Handover

   To support seamless connectivity, handover scheme is needed.  Simple
   handover scheme will reduce handover overhead of network operation
   and maintenance (OAM) and those of MSs.  Not only complexity but also
   latency of handover scheme should be considered.  Handover latency is
   recommended within 150ms for real-time services such as VoIP and
   streamming media.  Link extention for generic IP and/or MIPv4(MIPv6)
   can be considered for both IPv4 and IPv6 service as mobility

   management schemes.  In case of MIPv4(MIPv6), Fast Handovers will be
   useful.

5.2  Network aspect

   - Home agent location

   To support MSs mobility, Mobile IPv6 protocol can be considered as a
   mobility management protocol.  Home Agent (HA) location has an
   influence on efficiency of mobility management, simplicity of servers
   management, distribution of traffic and routing optimazation and so
   on.  The HA location is decided based on the anlysis of user mobility
   patterns during Phase 1.

   - IP allocation policy

   ISPs are reusing IP address with dynamic allocation because of
   lacking of IPv4 address space.  With IPv6, this problem will be
   solved.  ISPs do not need to worry about lack of IP address.  ISPs
   focus on how efficient and simple to assign IP address to MSs and
   subnet.  Static allocation, DHCP and auto-configuration are taken
   into account for IPv6 allocation.  Service failure rate caused by
   user's IP address mis-configuration and server management cost will
   be decision factors of IP allocation policy.


6.  Security considerations

   We do not consider any security issues in this draft.
