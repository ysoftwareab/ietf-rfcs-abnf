Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


1.  Introduction

   Any given host on a network may support a number of services.  Each
   of those services will have limits or optional features.  The
   advertising and discovery of services, features and limits is often
   through the use of properties and headers.  As the number of services
   and features grows the amount of data and complexity of the requests
   grows.

   Additionally, headers and properties don't allow for caching
   mechanisms based on etags.  A client has to fetch all the information
   and compare with its stored copies to determine if a service change
   has taken place.

   This specification defines a new XML document type which can be
   retrieved from a host and is easily extended to allow the description
   of complex services.  The schema as described here only handles basic
   DAV services.  Other specifications will extend this specification to
   define elements for other DAV based services.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Service

   By service we mean an application running on one or more hosts at the
   network application layer and above.  The service may provide data
   storage, manipulation, presentation, communication or other
   capabilities.  The service may use a well defined protocol and is
   often implemented with a client-server relationship.

   A service will usually implement one or more features which may be
   defined by standard specifications.  Services and features may also
   be constrained by various limits.

   Examples of services are

   o  caldav

   o  email

   o  File servers

Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


2.2.  Feature

   A feature is some functionality provided by a service.  For example,
   a DAV based service may provide the versioning feature.

   Services need not support all features that are defined as an
   optional part of that service.  Some features may depend on the
   authenticated state and/or the authorization of the authenticated
   principal.

   Examples of features are

   o  DAV versioning.

   o  DAV access control.

   o  CalDAV scheduling.

3.  Server Information Document Use

   A host will make the document available through one or more methods.
   Depending upon the endpoint and method of retrieval the retrieved
   document may describe one or more services.

   If a document provides information for more than one service it
   SHOULD contain information allowing clients to obtain information
   about each individual service only.  This allows a client to
   determine what the actual limits and features are for the specific
   service.

3.1.  Server Information Location and Retrieval

3.1.1.  DAV:server-info-href property

   Name:  server-info-href

   Namespace:  DAV

   Purpose:  To define the location of the server-info document.

   Protected:  This property MAY be protected.

   PROPFIND behavior:  This property SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND DAV:allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of
      [RFC4918]).

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value SHOULD be preserved in COPY
      and MOVE operations.

Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


   Description:  This property is needed for a client to determine where
      the server information document is located.  If not present, then
      no document is available for the server.

   Definition:

       <!ELEMENT server-info-href (DAV:href)>

3.1.2.  Server Information Retrieval

   The document may be retrieved from the server by doing a PROPFIND on
   the .well_known (or any location on the service) for the D:server-
   info-href property defined above.

   Clients SHOULD retrieve the document in the context of a session and
   services SHOULD ensure the context is appropriate.  Values in the
   returned document may differ depending on who is authenticated so a
   server SHOULD require authentication before returning server
   information for an authenticated service.

3.1.3.  Server Information Synchronization

   While server features may not change frequently it may be important
   for clients to react rapidly when server features or limits change.
   Polling for changes is undesirable so this specification allows for
   informing clients when the server information has changed.

   The returned server-info document contains an opaque token which the
   client can use to determine if the server copy is different.  This
   token is used in a number of places to aid client synchronization.

3.1.3.1.  Header Field: server-info-token

   The server-info-token header field takes as a value the current value
   of the token element in the server-info document.

   This header field may be returned with a response at any time a
   server feels appropriate.

   The server-info-token header MUST be returned for

   o  An OPTIONS request.

   o  The client sends a request with the server-info-token header field

   The server-info-token header field SHOULD be returned when a client

   o  Attempts to use an unsupported feature.

Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


   o  Misuses a feature according to the server info document.

   o  Exceeds a limit defined in the document.

   If the server returns a server-info-token header field as part of the
   response and if the value of that token differs from the value held
   by the client, then the client MUST fetch a new copy of the server
   information document.

4.  Server Information Document Structure

   This specification defines a new XML document type "server-info".
   All XML elements in this specification are in the DAV name space.

4.1.  Server Information server-info element

   At the top level of the document is a "server-info" element which
   encloses a change token, an optional "features" element and a
   "services" element

             <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
             <server-info xmlns="DAV">
               <token>...</token>
               <features>
                 ...
               </features>
               <services>
                 ...
               </services>
             </server-info>

   If a "features" element appears inside the "server-info" element then
   the features apply to all services.

4.2.  Server Information services element

   The "services" element appears once and contains 0 or more "service"
   elements each of which provides information about a service.

   NOTE: do the service have to be on the same host?  I think not.

4.2.1.  Server Information service element

   The "service" element contains the name and information about the
   location of that service and how to obtain a service specific server-
   info document.





Douglass                 Expires March 31, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


   It may also contain a "features" element which lists features
   implemented by that service.

   For example:

             <services>
               <features>
                 <DAV:class-1 />
                 <DAV:class-2 />
                 <DAV:access-control />
               </features>
               <service>
                 <name>caldav</name>
                 <href>https:cal.example.org//.well-known/caldav</href>
                 <features>
                   <CALDAV:calendar-access />
                   <CS:sharing>
                       <CS:no-scheduling />
                   </CS:sharing>
                 </features>
               </service>
             </services>

4.3.  Server Information features element

   The "features" element contains 0 or more elements each specifying a
   feature supported by that service.

   The "features" element may appear within the "server-info" element -
   in which case it applies to all services or it may appear inside a
   "service" element in which case it only applies to that service.

   When a single service is specified the features named SHOULD be
   accessible for the same authentication and authorization level.

4.3.1.  Server Information feature element

   A feature is specified by an element defined in this document or by
   an element defined in the specification for that feature.

   WebDAV feature elements correspond to, but are not exactly the same
   as, the elements returned in the DAV header.

   Some features have no corresponding DAV header element.  This may be
   because the feature is not available on all resources.  The
   occurrence of a such a feature simple advertises the availability of
   that feature on some resources.

Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


   For a service supporting this specification, the absence of a feature
   means that feature is NOT supported on any resource.

   For example, a calendar service may return the following which
   specifies a global set of features:

               <features>
                 <DAV:class-1 />
                 <DAV:class-2 />
                 <DAV:access-control />
                 <CALDAV:calendar-access />
                 <CALDAV:calendar-availability />
                 <CALDAV:calendar-auto-schedule />
               </features>

5.  XML Element Definitions

   All elements defined here are in the "DAV:" namespace.

5.1.  server-info XML element

   Name:  server-info

   Purpose:  Contains information about a single service.

   Definition:

Internet-Draft        Dav Server Information Object       September 2015


7.  Examples

7.1.  WebDAV server information

   TBD.

8.  Notes

   Tag enabling synchronization Document location (section 3) server-
   info token in DAV header returned as part of OPTIONS response Clients
   that see that and do not have a server-info document for that service
   should do a propfind to discover document href.  Authenticated v
   unauth Clients may fetch the si doc in an unauth mode.  When they
   auth they must recheck their token and refetch if appropriate.
   Caching by intermediaries might be an issue Server info may vary by
   user-agent.

9.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

10.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

11.  Acknowledgments
