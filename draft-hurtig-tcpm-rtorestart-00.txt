Abstract

   This document proposes to restart the TCP and the SCTP retransmission
   timer with consideration to the earliest outstanding segment and thus
   updates the standard algorithm.  It discusses the motivation, the
   required modifications and some experimental results.  This document
   focuses on TCP, but the motivation and required modifications also
   apply to SCTP as both protocols use the same algorithm for RTO
   management.

1.  Introduction

   The current RTO management algorithm ([RFC2988] for TCP and [RFC4960]
   for SCTP) recommends that the retransmission timer is restarted when
   an ACK that acknowledges new data is received and there is still
   outstanding data.  The restart is conducted to guarantee that
   unacknowledged segments will be retransmitted after RTO seconds.

   This approach causes retransmissions to occur RTO seconds after the
   last ACK has been received, not RTO seconds after the transmission of
   the lost segment(s).  This adds approximately one round-trip time
   (RTT) to the loss recovery time.  If the ACK that triggers the
   restart also is a delayed ACK [RFC1122] then the total loss recovery
   time can become RTO + RTT + delACK, where delACK corresponds to the
   receiver's delayed ACK settings.

   The retransmission timer restart process brings confusion to the loss
   recovery, as the time required for retransmitting lost segments
   depends on their position in the data stream.  Only the first data
   segment of a connection, or the first segment after an idle period,
   is retransmitted after exactly RTO seconds.  Remaining segments are
   retransmitted after RTO + RTT seconds or RTO + RTT + delACK seconds,
   depending on how many packets that have been sent and if the receiver
   employs delayed ACKs.

   This document proposes an alternative restart approach.  By resetting
   the timer to "RTO - T_earliest", where T_earliest is the time elapsed
   since the earliest outstanding segment was transmitted,
   retransmissions will always occur after exactly RTO seconds.  In
   addition to improving loss recovery performance, this approach causes

   the semantics of the loss recovery to be clear and unambiguous.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Proposed Modifications

   The document proposes an update of step 5.3 in Section 5 of [RFC2988]
   to (and a similar update of step R3 in section 6.3.2 of [RFC4960]):

      When an ACK is received that acknowledges new data, restart the
      retransmission timer so that it will expire RTO seconds after the
      earliest outstanding segment was transmitted (for the current
      value of RTO).

   The update requires TCP implementations to track the time elapsed
   since sending the last unacknowledged segment.  In practice, this
   could be achieved by adding one variable to the transmission control
   block.


3.  Experimental Results

   The currently standardized algorithm has been shown to add at least
   one RTT to the loss recovery process in TCP [LS00] and SCTP
   [HB08][PBP09].

   Applications that have timing requirements (e.g. telephony signaling,
   gaming and web traffic) rather than throughput requirements may want
   to use a lower RTOmin than the standard of 1 second (see e.g.
   [RFC4166]).  For such applications the proposed restart approach is
   important as the round-trip time and also the delayed ACK timer of
   receivers will be important factors in the effective loss recovery
   time.  In [HB08] where a RTOmin of 100 ms was used, is was shown that
   the total transfer time of a lost segment (including the original
   transmission time and the loss recovery time) could be reduced with
   up to 35% using the suggested approach.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses a change in how to set the retransmission
   timer's value when restarted.  This change does not raise any new
   security issues with TCP.
