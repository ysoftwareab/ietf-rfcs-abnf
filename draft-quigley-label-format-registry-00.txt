         Registry Specification for MAC Security Label Formats
                 draft-quigley-label-format-registry-00

Abstract

   In the past Mandatory Access Control(MAC) systems have used very
   rigid policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and
   platform.  As MAC systems are more widely deployed additional
   flexibility in mechanism and policy is required.  Where traditional
   trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security and integrity
   models, modern systems have expanded to include technologies such as
   type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms
   it has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible to
   accomodate all parties in one security label format and model.

   To accomodate multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats this document
   proposes a registry of label format specifications.  This registry
   contains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and string
   preferences and associates those identifiers with an extensive
   document outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular label
   format.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   With the acceptance of security labels in several mainstream
   operating systems the need to communicate labels between these
   systems becomes more important.  Unfortunately these systems are
   diverse enough that attempts at establishing one common label format
   have been unsucessful.  The reason for this is that systems implement
   different MAC models some of which do not share any common ground.

   One solution is to define a single label format which consists of the
   union of the requirements of all MAC models/implementations.  This is
   not ideal because it introduces an environment where many MAC models
   would either have blank fields for many of the label's components or
   will ignore the values that are present all together.  This
   environment introduces waste and complexity where it isn't needed.
   Additionally if a policy authority or identifier field is specified
   in the label format it would require a robust description that could
   be implemented which would lock policy administration into the
   described model.

   Ideally a mechanism to address this problem should allow the most
   flexibility possible in terms of policy administration while
   providing a specification that is suffient to allow for
   implementation of the label format and understanding of the semantics
   of the label.  This means that the label format specification (LFS)
   would ideally contain a syntactic description of the label format and
   a description of the semantics for each component in the label.  This
   allows protocols to specify the type of label and label semantics
   that it requires while leaving policy and policy administration to
   the individual organizations using the protocol in their environment.

   Policy administration within an organization is a difficult problem.
   This should not be made even more difficult by having to request
   permission from external entities when crafting new policy or just
   making department specific modifications to existing policies.  The
   policy authority field would allow an LFS to specify a scheme for
   policy administration without forcing it on all users of security
   labels.  However by agreeing to implement a particular LFS the
   protocol agrees to that policy administration mechanism when
   processing labels of that type.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a mechanism to associate label selection
   identifier with a document outlining the syntax and format of a
   label.  There is no security consideration in such an association.
   The label specification documents referenced by each registration
   entry should state security considerations for the label mechanism it
   specifies.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding creation of a new registry in accordance
   with RFC 5226.

   This submission requests the creation of a new registry called
   "Security Label Format Selection Registry".  The new registry has the
   following fields:
   o  Label Format Selector: An integer number that maps to a particular
      label format (e.g.  CALIPSO label format defined by RFC 5570).
      The name space of this identifier has the range of 0..65,535.
   o  Label Description: A human readable ASCII text string that
      describes the label format, e.g.  "Common Architecture Label IPv6
      Security Option (CALIPSO)".  The length of this field is limited
      to 128 bytes.
   o  Status: A short ASCII text string indicating the status of an
      entry in the registry.  The status field for most entries should
      have the value "active".  In the case that a label format
      selection entry is obsolete, the status field of the obsoleted
      entry should be "obsoleted by entry NNN".
   o  Label Format Specification: A reference to a stable, public
      document that specify the label format, e.g. an URL to RFC 5570.

   The Label Format Selector name space ranges from 0 to 65,535.  The
   initial assignments of the registry are as follows:

                  Table 1: Label Format Specifier Ranges

   A label format specification document is required to add a new entry
   to this registry.  The IANA Consideration section of the label format
   document should clearly reference the Label Format Selection registry
   and request allocation of a new entry.  The well-known IANA policy,
   Specification Required, as defined in section 4.1 of RFC 5226, will
   be used to handle such requests.  Note that "Specification Required"
   policy implies this process requires a Designated Expert reviewer,
   i.e. adding a new entry to this registry requires both a published
   label format specification and a Designated Expert review.

   In the case that a label format selector number is assigned to a
   label format and the label format specification is changed later, a
   new selector assignment should be requested.  The same Specification
   Required IANA policy applies to such requests.  The IANA
   Consideration section of the updated label format specification
   should be explicit in which old label selector assignment it
   obsoletes.  Below is an example of obsoleted entry in the registry:
