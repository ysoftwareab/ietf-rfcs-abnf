                  NETCONF Notification over WebSocket
                  draft-iijima-netconf-websocket-ps-00

Abstract

   This memo proposes transporting NETCONF Notification over WebSocket
   protocol[I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].  RFC5277[RFC5277]
   specifies that NETCONF Notification must be sent over SSH, BEEP, SSL
   and console from an NETCONF server to NETCONF clients.  When NETCONF
   Notification was defined, this transport mapping was a reasonable
   decision.  Bi-directional capability is necessary for transporting
   NETCONF Notification.  But at present, WebSocket protocol, which is
   based on HTTP and has a bi-directional capability, is available.
   This memo describes the way in which NETCONF Notification is sent
   over WebSocket protocol.

                   Figure 1: NETCONF Event Notification

   At the time of standardizing NETCONF Notification, there were no
   transport protocols other than BEEP, SSH, SSL, or console for
   transporting NETCONF Notification.  Bi-directional capability is
   necessary for that purpose.  This is the reason why SOAP/HTTP/TLS,
   one of the transport protocol for NETCONF as defined in
   RFC4741[RFC4741], is excluded from this figure.  SOAP/HTTP/TLS lacks
   bi-directional capability.  Although Ajax and Comet technologies were
   considered as solutions, it was excluded from this figure after all.

   But at present, WebSocket protocol is available.  It is based on HTTP
   and has a bi-directional capability.  Although standardization of the
   protocol is still underway in IETF, there are already some
   implementations.  For example, Jetty[Jetty], Kaazing[Kaazing], and
   Apache/pywebsocket are available as WebSocket servers.  And,
   Chrome[Chrome] and FireFox[FireFox] are available as WebSocket
   clients.  WebSocket protocol is expected to replace Ajax and Comet
   technologies, which are used widely in the current Web applications.
   And it can enable realtime communications between WebSocket servers

   and clients.  Thus, supporting WebSocket protocol for transporting
   NETCONF Notification will enable realtime event notification from an
   NETCONF server to NETCONF clients.

3.  Use cases

3.1.  Complementing NETCONF over SOAP/HTTP/TLS

   As mentioned in the previous chapter, SOAP was excluded from the
   transport protocol of NETCONF Notification.  Therefore, when SOAP/
   HTTP/TLS was used as a transport protocol of NETCONF messages,
   NETCONF Notification needs to be sent over BEEP, SSH, SSL, or
   console.  But BEEP, SSH, SSL don't work closely enough to SOAP/HTTP/
   TLS.  On the other hand, WebSocket protocol is HTTP-based.  SOAP and
   WebSocket can share HTTP.  Both an exchange of NETCONF messages over
   SOAP/HTTP/TLS and NETCONF Notification over WebSocket are handled by
   one single HTTP daemon.  This helps developers implement NETCONF
   Notification.

3.2.  Using NETCONF in cloud computing

   Using WebSocket protocol is not necessarily limited to transporting
   NETCONF Notification.  WebSocket protocol is used for exchanging
   NETCONF messages specified in RFC4741[RFC4741].  In fact, some
   vendors are implementing configuration mechanism which sends XML over
   HTTP.  The part of HTTP can be easily replaced by WebSocket.  By
   replacing HTTP by WebSocket, vendors can support configuration and
   notification mechanisms that are conducted on a single WebSocket
   connection.

   Furthermore, WebSocket is defining APIs[WebSocket API], which is
   tailored for JavaScript and is supported by several Web browsers.
   Currently, various APIs are available for controlling cloud resources
   and are provided on the assumption that they are used in Web
   environment.  For example, DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force)
   is standardizing REST APIs in CMWG (Cloud Management Working Group)
   for controlling cloud resources[DMTF].  REST APIs is used in Web
   environement.

   Consequently, supporting WebSocket protocol as a transport protocol
   of NETCONF helps developers develop NETCONF clients that works
   together with cloud computing technologies.

4.  WebSocket Messages for NETCONF Notifications

   This section specifies the messages exchanged between NETCONF server
   and an NETCONF client when WebSocket protocol is used for NETCONF
   Notification.

4.1.  WebSocket Message from NETCONF client to NETCONF server

   WebSocket handshake is necessary before establishing an NETCONF
   session for NETCONF Notification.  WebSocket handshake needs to be
   initiated by an NETCONF client.  Figure 2 is an example of WebSocket
   message sent from an NETCONF client to an NETCONF server.


      C: GET /netconf HTTP/1.1
      C: Host: netconfdevice
      C: Upgrade: websocket
      C: Connection: Upgrade
      C: Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
      C: Sec-WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com
      C: Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: netconf


     Figure 2: WebSocket message from NETCONF client to NETCONF server

   As written in [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol], GET instead of
   POST needs to be specified in the WebSocket header.  And, fields of
   'Upgrade' and 'Connection' need to be specified as 'websocket' and
   'Upgrade' respectively, so that an HTTP daemon residing in the
   NETCONF server understands that it needs to work as an WebSocket
   daemon.  Futhremore, the field of 'Sec-WebSocket-Protocol' should be
   specified as 'netconf', so that the WebSocket daemon understands that
   it needs to hand over messages sent over this connection to the
   NETCONF server.

   In the case of using WebSocket API in Chrome or FireFox, for example,
   an establishment of WebSocket connection and specification of
   "netconf" is made by the following APIs.


      vas wsURL = "ws://" + host + "/netconf";
      ws = new WebSocket(wsURL, "netconf");

4.2.  WebSocket Message from NETCONF server to NETCONF client

   Figure 4 is an example of WebSocket message sent from an NETCONF
   server to an NETCONF client.


      S: HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
      S: Upgrade: websocket
      S: Connection: Upgrade
      S: Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
      S: Sec-WebSocket-Nonce: AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEC==
      S: Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: netconf


     Figure 4: WebSocket message from NETCONF server to NETCONF client

   In this case too, fields of 'Upgrade' and 'Connection' need to be
   specified as 'websocket' and 'Upgrade' respectively, in order to let
   the NETCONF client know that an HTTP daemon is running as the
   WebSocket daemon.  Futhremore, the field of 'Sec-WebSocket-Protocol'
   should be specified as 'netconf', in order to let the NETCONF client
   know that the WebSocket daemon accepts NETCONF messages.

5.  NETCONF Messages over WebSocket

   After above WebSocket handshake, an NETCONF client and an NETCONF
   server should start exchanges of NETCONF messages.  In the case of
   NETCONF Notification, capability exchange between an NETCONF client
   and a server and subsequent subscription request from the NETCONF
   client to the server should be sent after WebSocket connection is
   established.  During this period, HTTP header is unnecessary anymore.
   NETCONF messages as well as NETCONF Notifications should be
   encapusulated according to the Data Framing specified in WebSocket
   protocol[I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4741] and [RFC5277] are applicable
   to this document.  Implementers or users should take these
   considerations into account.

   Transport-level security, such as authentication of users and
   encryption of transport protocol, has to be ensured by TLS (Transport
   Layer Security).  That is, security has to be provided in the form of
   NETCONF/WSS(WebSocket over TLS).
