Internet-Draft             PKIX OIDs for EdDSA                 June 2015


1.  Introduction

   In [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves], Curve25519 and Curve448 are described.
   They are Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) functions, designed
   with performance and security in mind.

   This RFC define ASN.1 "named curve" object identifiers for Curve25519
   and Curve448 (aka Goldilocks) public keys, for use in the Internet
   X.509 PKI [RFC5280].

   Rather than defining a new subject public key format for these two
   curves, this document re-use the existing ECDH public-key contained
   (described in section 2.3.5 of [RFC3279]) and introduce two new
   "named curve" OIDs.  This approach is the same as for the Brainpool
   curves [RFC5639].

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Curve25519 and Curve448 Public Keys

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] may convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  This algorithm identifier is an OID
   and optionally associated parameters.  Section 2.3.5 of [RFC3279]
   describe ECDH public keys, specifying the id-ecPublicKey OID.  This
   OID has the associated EcpkParameters parameters structure, which
   contains the namedCurve CHOICE.  Here we introduce two new OIDs for
   use in the namedCurve field.

       id-Curve25519 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.7 }
         id-Curve447 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.8 }

   The OID id-Curve25519 refers to Curve25519.  The OID id-Curve448
   refers to Curve448.  Both curves are described in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

   The public key value encoded into the ECPoint value is the raw binary
   values described in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves].

4.  Acknowledgements

   Text and/or inspiration were drawn from [RFC5280], [RFC3279],
   [RFC5480], and [RFC5639].

Internet-Draft             PKIX OIDs for EdDSA                 June 2015


   Several people suggested the utility of specifying OIDs for encoding
   Curve25519/Curve448 public keys into PKIX certificates, the editor of
   this document cannot take credit for this idea.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC5280], [RFC5480] and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves] apply accordingly.
