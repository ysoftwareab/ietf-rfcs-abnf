1.  Introduction

   [RFC5512] specifies a method by which Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   speakers can signal tunnel encapsulation information to each other
   and accordingly it defines support for Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE) [RFC2784], Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)
   [RFC3931] and IP in IP [RFC2003] tunnel types.  This document builds
   on [RFC5512] and defines support for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
   tunnel type which is applicable to the MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-in-udp].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5512].

3.  BGP Tunnel Type Code for UDP

   To use either the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier
   (SAFI) or the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community defined in
   [RFC5512] to signal the UDP tunnel type information across BGP
   speakers, a new Tunnel Type code (TBD) indicating the UDP tunnel type
   needs to be assigned by IANA.  This document does not specify any UDP
   tunnel specific sub-TLV.  Furthermore, the BGP Encapsulation Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) Format is not modified by this
   document.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations mentioned in [RFC5512] is applicable to
   this new BGP Tunnel Type code for UDP tunnels as well.  No new
   security risk is introduced by this new Tunnel Type code for UDP
   tunnels.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new BGP Tunnel Type code indicating the UDP tunnel type needs to be
   assigned by IANA.
