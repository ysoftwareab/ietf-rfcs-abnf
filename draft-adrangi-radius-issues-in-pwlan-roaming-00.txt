   Abstract 
    
     There are a number of IETF drafts that describe use of RADIUS in a 
     variety of scenarios.  However, in the context of Public Wireless 
     LAN (PWLAN) deployments, there are still some areas where either 
     use of RADIUS is unclear or not covered. To address this problem, 
     we first need to generate a list of RADIUS issues significant to 
     public wireless LAN roaming (authenticating and obtaining service 
     on a network operated by or affiliated with a home providerÆs 
     ôroaming partnerö).  Once these issues are understood and 
     analyzed, we can take appropriate actions to solve them.  This 
     document describes some of RADIUS issues encountered in PWLAN 
     deployments and roaming scenarios.

   1. Introduction  
    
      A PWLAN network is comprised of three main components that work 
      together to provide users with wireless access to the public 
      network.  These components are: the Access Points (AP), the 
      Router which links to the Internet and the Authentication Server 
      (AS).  Currently, there are two standard protocols used to 
      implement an AS, which are : 1) RADIUS [1] 2) DIAMETER [2] IETF 
      Protocols.  However, we will only focus on use of RADIUS protocol 
      hereafter in this document.  The following diagram shows a simple 
      RADIUS-based PWLAN network architecture.

      Authentication exchanges are carried out between the end-user 
      (authenticating peer) and the home RADIUS server (authentication 
      server) through the AP/RADIUS-Client acting as a bridge.  From 
      the end-user to the AP/RADIUS-Client, the protocol is EAP [3] 
      over wireless.  On the back-end, the protocol used is RADIUS. 
      This is also referred to as ôEAP over RADIUSö [4]. 
        
       
      In the roaming context, the network topology depicted above 
      becomes slightly complicated.  Two new components, visited RADIUS 
      proxy and intermediary RADIUS proxy, are introduced to the 
      network.  Simply put, these two components are basically a RADIUS 
      server used in a particular roaming scenario.  There are three 
      possible roaming scenarios: 1) Roaming within the home network û 
      the AP/RADIUS client directly communicates with the home RADIUS 
      server.  2) Roaming within a foreign network which has direct 
      roaming agreement with the home network û the AP/RADIUS client 
      communicates with the home RADIUS server through the visited 
      RADIUS proxy located in the foreign network. 3) Roaming within a 
      foreign network which has an indirect roaming agreement with the 
      home network û the AP/RADIUS client communicates with the home 
      RADIUS server through the visited RADIUS proxy and 1 or more 
      intermediary RADIUS proxies managed by the roaming partners.  The 
      following diagram depicts the network topology that supports the 
      above roaming scenarios.

      the aforementioned roaming scenarios.  At this point, this 
      document does not provide or suggest any solution to the issues. 
    
   2. Terminology 
    
   Access Point (AP) 
      ôA Station that provides access to the distribution services via 
      the wireless medium for associated Stations.ö 

   Network Access Server (NAS)

      ôThe device providing access to the network. Also known as the 
      Authenticator (IEEE 802.1X or EAP terminology) or RADIUS client.ö
        
      RADIUS server 
      ôThis is a server which provides for authentication/authorization 
      via the protocol described in [1], and for accounting as 
      described in [6].ö   
    
      RADIUS proxy 
      ôIn order to provide for the routing of RADIUS authentication and 
      accounting requests, a RADIUS proxy can be employed. To the NAS, 
      the RADIUS proxy appears to act as a RADIUS server, and to the 
       RADIUS server,
                   
                  the proxy appears to act as a RADIUS client.ö 
    
   3. General Issues  
       
      This section describes a list of current issues in no particular 
      order in terms of importance or priority. 
         
   3.1 The lack of Identity for Accounting Purposes with privacy 
   protection 
           
       In some cases the userÆs identity may not be known to the 
       AP/RADIUS-client (For example, the authenticating peer uses a 
       tunneled  authentication  protocol,  such  as  PEAP  [5],  which 
       protects the userÆs identity).  This can be a problem as the 
       AP/RADIUS-Client needs to know the userÆs identity for RADIUS 
       accounting [6] purposes or other things.   

   3.2 The lack of Standard ôFilter Profilesö 
     
       Typically RADIUS server relays information about session 
       authorizations through the Filter-ID attribute which contains 
       pointers to certain ôfilter profilesö.  Examples of a filter 
       profile are ômail-onlyö, ôlocal-netö, ôFull-netö, and ôAccess-
       to-multimedia-servicesö which correspond to various account 
       types and help the RADIUS client to enforce restriction on a 
       session.  Filter profiles for authorizing commonly used services 
       are not standardized and therefore there is a need for 
       standardizing most common filter profiles or providing standard 
       attributes for this functionality.  The main reason behind this 
       is to ensure interoperability between RADIUS client, RADIUS 
       proxy, and RADIUS server implementations from different vendors. 

   3.3 The Problem with RADIUS Proxy Routing 
    
       There is no consistent mechanism by which RADIUS proxies can 
       determine the next hop in an interoperable manner.    

   3.4 The lack of a method to specify the Access Network Location

   Internet Draft  Radius Issues for Wireless Networks   16 June 2003 
               

      The RADIUS server needs the Access Network Location Identifier 
      (probably BSSID) and name for Management and Accounting purposes.  

    
   3.5 The lack of a method to specify the type of clientÆs IP address  
    
      There is a need to specify whether a public or a private IP 
      address type should be assigned to the client by the wireless 
      network.  The RADIUS server determines this based on the service 
      profile that it is going to authorize for the user.  For example, 
      if the user is being authorized for services that are not NAT 
      friendly (e.g., H.323 based services), then the RADIUS server can 
      request for a public address to be assigned to the user. 
    
   3.6 The problem of differentiating between access service types 
    
       There is a need for the RADIUS server to distinctly identify 
       ôwirelessö NASes from other types like Dialup and Ethernet for 
       Management and Accounting purposes. 
    
   3.7 The lack of a method to relay the Mobile IP Home Agent address 
   to the NAS 

       There is a need for the RADIUS server to convey the Mobile IP 
       Home Agent address to the RADIUS client for subsequent use in 
       DHCP. 
        
   3.8 The lack of an interoperable method to express quality of 
   service parameters to the NAS 

       There is a need for the RADIUS server to convey the quality of 
       service parameters for each user to the NAS in an interoperable 
       manner.
