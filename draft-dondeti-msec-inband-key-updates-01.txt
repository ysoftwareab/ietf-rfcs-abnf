Abstract

   IPsec and SRTP use out-of-band key management.  Synchronization of
   group security associations is an issue when out-of-band key
   management protocols are used.  In case of rapid or unplanned
   rekeying, some members may not receive the key updates in time to
   decrypt the IPsec or SRTP traffic.  To address that problem, this
   document describes a strawman proposal to carry group key updates as
   part of IPsec and SRTP.

Internet-Draft             Inband Key Updates               October 2005


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Synchronization of group security associations (GSA) after rekeying
   is a difficult problem.  Currently in the IETF MSEC protocols,
   repeated retransmission of rekey messages is suggested as a reliable
   transport mechanism.  Other solutions such as forward error
   correction (FEC), feedback based mechanisms for reliable delivery of
   key updates are also proposed in the research literature.  However,
   even with the use of reliable delivery mechanisms for sending group
   key updates, it is plausible that some members do not receive the
   updates in time to decrypt data packets encapsulated with the new
   GSA.

   To ensure that all members receive a GSA before it is used to
   encapsulate packets, it is plausible to plan SA updates so that all
   members receive the updates in time.  However, in some rekeying
   scenarios, for instance in membership revocation and immediate
   rekeying (as opposed to say, batch rekeying), there is only a small
   window between delivering the new GSA and using it to protect data
   transmission.  Members may also have been offline during a GSA update
   and may be forced to wait for the next update or request to receive
   the update via a secure unicast channel.

   A solution other than reliable delivery to ensure that all group
   members receive key updates in time is to piggyback key material on
   security encapsulated data packets.  This is the case in 3GPP2 BCMCS
   specification, with an overloading of the master key identifier (MKI)
   field of SRTP packets.  Incidentally, solutions along these lines --
   MKI field reuse not withstanding -- are not uncommon: for example,
   SRTP-TESLA packets contain disclosed TESLA keys.  Furthermore, there
   were some verbal proposals in the IETF MSEC WG on piggybacking key
   material with data packets to ensure reliable delivery of rekey
   messages.


2.  Piggybacking key updates in encapsulated data packets

   We propose to include all or a portion of GSA update messages as part
   of encapsulated data packets as a mechanism to synchronize GSAs
   easily and efficiently.  In the simplest case, an SA update fits
   within a single encapsulated packet and makes it convenient for a
   group member to first recover the SA update followed by decapsulating
   the data.  More generally, the SA update is FEC encoded and pieces of
   the update are included with data packets so that receipt of np1
   packets out of np successive packets will enable a group member to
   extract the GSA update required to decrypt those packets.

Internet-Draft             Inband Key Updates               October 2005


   The proposed solution has several use cases.  In the simplest case, a
   small amount of data is included in every packet which when
   (cryptographically) combined with initial key material or SA material
   results in the current SA.  In this case, note that the receiver can
   use any single encapsulated packet to recover the current SA and
   decapsulate the packet.

   In a more complex case, the sender encodes the GSA update using FEC
   and includes portions of the update in more than one encapsulated
   packet.  The receiver needs only a subset of the packets containing a
   GSA update to recover the GSA.  More formally, a receiver needs np1
   packets out of np successive packets to acquire the GSA update
   message.

   It is easy to conceive use cases in between the above two examples.

   One immediate problem to think about is the protection afforded to
   the "key update" portion of the encapsulated data packets.  Note that
   the assumption is that the data itself is protected by the new GSA,
   and that the key material cannot be protected with the new GSA.  The
   key material might be protected with a combination of old and the new
   GSAs.  Details TBD.

5.  Details on the GSA Update addition to the encapsulations

   This version of the document is short on details.  But, in short, the
   GSA update might contain a identity payload (say 16 bits in length)
   for various different uses of the field.  The new payload might
   contain a full GSA update or an FEC block of a GSA update.  The new
   field needs integrity protection and typically encrypted independent
   of the encapsulated data packet.
