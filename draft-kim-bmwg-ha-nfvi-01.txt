1.  Introduction

   As both the amount and variety of traffic massively increase,
   operators are adopting SDN and NFV, the new paradigm of networking,
   in order to secure scalability and flexibility.  Service providers
   and venders are developing SDN and NFV solutions to reduce CAPEX and
   OPEX, focusing on the increment of the scalability and flexibility of
   the network with programmable networking.

   While VNF and NFVI replacing the legacy network devices and operators
   selecting the fittest one from various products, operators have
   several issues such as availability, resiliency and immeasurable
   failures.  Above all, they want to ensure the availability of the VNF
   products and their infrastructures.

   Customer expectations on the availability of service are as high as
   five 9s on any infrastructure operators offer because the standard
   availability of 4G mobile communication on the legacy physical
   network among operators has been already five 9s; downtime being 5.26
   minutes per year.  Therefore, to meet the customer expectations,
   services on the NFV infrastructure also need to meet the availability
   to that level, five 9s.  Furthermore, the availability of NFV
   infrastructure needs to be almost six 9s with the consideration of
   the impact of virtualization and interoperability among different
   vendor solutions and layers.  From the operator point of view, the
   availability is the most important feature and the benchmarking tests
   for the high availability of NFV infrastructure are also important.

   This document investigates considerations for high availability of
   NFV Infrastructure benchmarking test.

2.  Considerations for Benchmarking High Availability of NFV
    Infrastructure

   This section defines and lists considerations which must be addressed
   to benchmark the high availability of the NFV infrastructure.

2.1.  Definitions for High Availability Benchmarking Test

   Metrics for high availability Benchmarking of NFV infrastructure are
   as follows.

   o  Failure Detection Time : the time takes to detect a failure

   o  Failure Recovery Time : the time takes to recover the failure

   o  Failure Rates : the frequency of failures

   o  Success Rates of Detection Time : the percentage of success among
      a number of attempts to detect failures

   o  Success Rates of Recovery : the percentage of success among a
      number of attempts to recover the failures

   o  Failure Impact Fraction : the fraction of the infrastructure when
      a failure happens

   Generally, availability and failure rates are defined as follows,
   where MTBF stands for Mean Time Between Failure and MTTR stands for
   Mean Time To Recovery.

   Availability : MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)

   Failure Rates : 1 - Availability

   A failover procedure in an infrastructure is as follows.

   Failure -> Failure Detection -> Isolation -> Recovery, therefore
   failover time starts from the time when a failure happens.

2.2.  Configuration Parameters for Benchmarking Test

   o  Types of VNFs; depending on the type of VNF, followings are
      different.

      1.  What kind of operations they do

      2.  How many CPUs, MEMs, Storages they need

      3.  What kind of traffic pattern they usually face

   o  The specification of the physical machine which VMs

   o  The mapping ratio of hardware resources to VMs(virtual machine)
      where VNF runs, such as vCPU:pCPU (virtual CPU to physical CPU),
      vMEM:pMEM (virtual memory to physical memory), vNICs as shown
      below.

   o  Types of hypervisor and the different limitations of their roles.

   o  Cloud Design Pattern of NFVI

   o  The composition of network functions in VNFs : for example,
      sometimes in vEPC implementations, PGW(Packet Data Network
      Gateway) and SGW(Serving Gateway) are combined or PGW+SGW+MME.

 +---------------+                   +---------------+
 | vCPU for VNF1 |                   |               |
 +---------------+                   | vCPU for VNF2 |
 +---------------+                   |               | +---------------+
 | vCPU for VNF2 |                   +---------------+ | vCPU for VNF1 |
 +---------------+                                     +---------------+
 +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
 | vCPU for VNF3 | | vCPU for VNF2 | | vCPU for VNF3 | | vCPU for VNF3 |
 +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
 +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
 |     pCPU 1    | |     pCPU 2    | |    pCPU 3     | |    pCPU 4     |
 +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+

3.  High Availability Benchmarking test strategies

   This section discusses benchmarking test strategies for high
   availability of NFV infrastructure.  For the continuity of the
   services, followings needs to be considered.

3.1.  Single Point of Failure Check

   All devices and software have potential failures, therefore,
   redundancy is mandatory.  First, the redundancy implementation of
   every sing point of NFV infrastructure must be tested as shown below.

   o  Hardware

      *  Power supply

      *  CPU

      *  MEM

      *  Storage

      *  Network :NICs, ports, LAN cable, ..

   o  Software

      *  The redundancy of VNFs

      *  The redundancy of VNFs path

      *  The redundancy of OvS

      *  The redundancy of vNICs

      *  The redundancy of VMs

3.2.  Failover Time Check

   Even though the components of NFV infrastructure are redundant,
   failover time can be long.  For example, when a failure happens, the
   VNF with failure stops and should be replaced by backup VNF but the
   time to be shifted to the new VNF can be varied with the VNF;
   stateless or stateful.  Namely, redundancy does not guarantees high
   availability and short failover time is required to reach high
   availability.  This section discusses strategy about measuring
   failover time.

   In order to measure the failover time presicely, the time when
   failure happens must be defined.  Followings are three different
   criteria which is the time when failure happens.

   1.  The time starts when failure actually happens

   2.  The time starts when failure detected by manager or controller

   3.  The time starts when failure event alerts to the operator

   As the actual operations in VNFs and NFV infrastructure start to be
   changed when failure happens, the precise time of the failure
   happened must be the 1.  When measuring the failover time, it starts
   from the time when the failures happens at a point in NFV
   infrastructure or VNF itself.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA Action is requested at this time.
