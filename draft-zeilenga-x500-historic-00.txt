Abstract

  This note discusses moving a number of old X.500 RFCs to Historic
  status including:

      "Replication and Distributed Operations extensions to provide an
       Internet Directory using X.500" [RFC1276],

      "X.500 and Domains" [RFC1279], and

      "Use of an X.500/LDAP directory to support MIXER address mapping"
       [RFC2164].

  There are numerous other old X.500 RFCs which likely should be added
  to this list.


1. Background

1.1. RFC 1276

  RFC 1276 describes replication and distributed operations extensions
  to X.500(88).  It is described as an "INTERIM" approach.  X.500(93)
  provides standard replication and distributed operation mechanisms
  which are clearly technically superior.

  RFC 1276 was published ten years ago on the Standard Track.  It is
  believed not to be in use nor to have independently developed
  interoperable implementations.


1.2. RFC 1279

  RFC 1279 describes X.500 and Domains.  This information is largely
  superceeded by RFC 2164 and RFC 2247.  RFC 1279 was published ten
  years ago as Experimental.


1.3. RFC 2164

  RFC 2164 describes use of X.500/LDAP directory to support MIXER
  address mapping.  It was published nearly four years ago as a Proposed
  Standard.  However, the document has normative references to RFC 1836
  and RFC 1837, both Experimental.


2. Security Considerations

  The security of the Internet will not be impacted by the retirement of
  these specifications.


3. Recommendation

  It is recommended that RFC 1276, RFC 1279, and RFC 2164 be moved to
  Historic status.
