        Camellia Galois Counter Mode (GCM) Cipher Suites for TLS
                    draft-kanno-tls-camellia-gcm-00

Abstract

   This document describes the use of the Camellia in Galois Counter
   Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS) authenticated
   encryption operation.  This document defines TLS cipher suites that
   use Camellia-GCM with RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange and
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

Internet-Draft         Camellia-GCM Cipher suites           January 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of Camellia in Galois Counter Mode
   (GCM) [5] (Camellia-GCM) with various key exchange mechanisms as a
   cipher suite for TLS 1.2 [4] or greater.  Camellia-GCM is an
   authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher ( as
   defined in TLS 1.2 ) providing both confidentiality and data origin
   authentication.  The following sections define cipher suites based on
   RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.  Also, Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC) based cipher suites are defined in this document.

   The Camellia algorithm and its properties are described in [2].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

2.  Camellia-GCM Cipher Suites

   The following cipher suites use the new authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 with Camellia in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) :

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256          = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384          = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256       = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256       = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256  = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384  = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256   = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384   = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256    = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384    = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256     = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384     = {TBD,TBD}

   Camellia-GCM cipher suites are defined in Section 3 of RFC5288 [3]
   and Section 3.2 of RFC5289 [6] as well.

3.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   [7], [8], and [9]).

   For security considerations of Camellia-GCM for TLS, this document
   refers to Section 6 of RFC5288 [3] and Section 4 of RFC5289 [6].

   IANA is requested to allocate (has allocated) the following numbers
   in the TLS Cipher Suite Registry:

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384          = {TBD,TBD}
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD}
