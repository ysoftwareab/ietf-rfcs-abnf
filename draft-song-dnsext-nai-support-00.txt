Internet Draft                                           4 January 2002

1. Introduction

   The demand for wireless mobile networking has been dramatically 
   increased thanks to rapid development of wireless technology and 
   de facto Mobile IP technology [1].  Therefore, the need for 
   standardized method of specifying the user over different Internet 
   Service Providers (ISPs) was identified.  NAI is as defined in 
   RFC-2486 provides the standardized method for identifying users 
   in order to accomplish the interoperability for roaming and 
   tunneling over multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
   The NAI (Network Access Identifier) is of the form user@realm [3].

   The DNS basically provides a mechanism to map between hostnames and
   IP address with support of many other RRs thorough hierarchically 
   built domain names.
   
   Combining above two, NAI and DNS shall enable IP user mobility [2].
   The IP user mobility is the ability of end user to send and 
   receive IP datagrams regardless of the location of the mobile 
   terminal and user location. 
   
   This document specifies a new RR type for NAI, mapping host IP 
   address and user identifier (NAI) [3].


2. Applicability Statement
   
   The NAI RR defines user identifier, NAI widely used for PPP dialup 
   connection and Mobile IPv4.  The basic idea is to let mobile Internet 
   user to constantly update its location(IP address), while moving 
   around multiple access provider network.  It can enables 
   correspondent user to always reach the specific user by querying NAI 
   to name server, regardless of the location.
   
   It is expected that NAI RR will be used in IRS(Internet Reachability
   Service) of 3GPP2 wireless IP network standard [4] (see Appendix A) 
   and IP user mobility application [5].  Those application depends on 
   one to one mapping of NAI and mobile host IP address in name server.

3. NAI RR Type
   
   NAI name space is resemble to Domain Name Space, except that it is a 
   sequence of one or more labels, made of the user identifier and
   domain name.  The "@" sign before realm, shall be treated as a 
   delimiter to flag user ID part.  Every user Identifier 
   shall end with "@" sign and placed before domain name.  NAI records 
   cause no additional section processing

   The NAI record has the DNS RR type of "?", hence has the same QTYPE 
   number of "?".  Note NAI RR requires IANA number assignment.
   
   The class of NAI RR is defined in the IN class only.

   TTL should be configured to minimize the time of the RR being cached

   The RDATA of NAI is same as A RDATA format, 32 bit Internet Address

4. Examples

   Resource Record for NAI(junhyuk@samsung.skt.co.kr) is like below:
  
   junhyuk@.samsung.skt.co.kr.  86400  IN   NAI  165.213.221.4


5. IANA Considerations

   It requires new RR type number from IANA.

Appendix A. IRS of 3GPP2 wireless IP Network standard 


   In this example, we've omitted the detail operation of deleting 
   DNS record in case of user disconnect.  In IRS, it is assumed that 
   MS desires to be reached by a fixed identifier such as an NAI-like
   hostname


1. Simple IP operation
   
   Upon connecting to new access network MS(Mobile Station) shall 
   generate CHAP authentication with NAI for user authentication.  
   After successfully authenticate the user authentication request, 
   AAAH shall send DNS A record update message to name server.
   (See figure 1)

                        +--------------+  PPP CHAP(5)  +--------------+
                                  ^ |     Auth Ack                |    
                       PPP CHAP   | |                    User     |     
                       Auth Req   | | PPP CHAP           Location |  
                           (2)    | | Auth Ack           Update(4)|

2. Mobile IP operation

   When the HA receives and successfully replies to an initial Mobile IP 
   Registration Request, it performs the DNS update for the MS if it has 
   previously received an indication from the home RADIUS server to do 
   so, or has otherwise been provisioned to do so.  The HA shall send a 
   DNS Update message [RFC 2136] to the DNS server to add a Resource 
   Record for the MS, if so required by the home RADIUS server [4].
   (See figure 2)
