Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for
   managing DS3 and E3 interfaces.  This document is a companion
   document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1/E1 and
   SONET/SDH Interface Types, rfc1406 [8] and rfc1595 [9].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

   This document entirely replaces RFC 1233, which contains a
   fundamental error: many objects are encoded as Counters that must be
   encoded as Integer32s or Gauge32s.  The magnitude of the change
   required is sufficient that virtually every object changed.
   Therefore, the MIB documented in RFC 1233 should not be implemented.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

   0    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
        for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
        management.

   0    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
        managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   0    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
        architectural aspects of the framework.

   0    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
        access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
   purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

2.1.  Changes from RFC1233

   This MIB obsoletes RFC1233.  The changes from RFC1233 are the
   following:

     --  This MIB module contains information to manage
         an E3 interface, also.

     --  This MIB module contains three groups:
          DS3/E3 Near End Group which is mandatory,
          DS3 Far End Group which is optional, and
          DS3 Fractional Group which is optional.

     --  The DS3 Far End Group is a new group and contains
         configuration information and statistics
         that are collected from the far end DS3/E3 interface.
         Presently, the Far End Group may only be implemented by
         DS3 systems that use C-bit Parity or SYNTRAN.

     --  The DS3 Fractional Group is a new group and is
         modeled after the DS1 Fractional Group.

     --  ds3CSUIndex has been redefined and renamed
         to dsx3LineIndex.  This object
         is the identifier of a DS3/E3 Interface on a device.
         On a CSU, a single DS3/E3 data stream will cross two DS3/E3
         interfaces, which have separate dsx3LineIndex values.

     --  ds3Index has been redefined and renamed to
         dsx3IfIndex.  This value for this
         object is equal to the value of ifIndex from the Interfaces
         table of MIB II (STD 17, RFC 1213).

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DS3/E3 MIB                   October 1995


     --  The ACCESS for objects in the dsx3ConfigTable has
         been set to read-write for items that are configurable.

     --  The dsx3ZeroCoding has been renamed to dsx3LineCoding.

     --  A new object has been added called dsx3LoopbackConfig,
         which better describes the loopback capabilities of
         a DS3/E3 interface on a device.

     --  The dsx3SendCode object has been updated to reflect
         different types of loopback messages.

     --  A new object has been added called dsx3LineStatus.
         This object better describes the status (e.g.,
         failure state and loopback state) of a
         DS3/E3 interface.

     --  A new object has been added called dsx3TransmitClockSource.
         This object identifies the source for the transmit clock.

     --  All Counters have been changed to Gauge32s.

     --  A Line Errored Seconds object has been added to
         all near end tables.

     --  Line Coding Violations are counted instead of Bipolar
         Violations.

     --  A new Coding Violation counter has been added to count
         coding violations reported via the C-bits of SYNTRAN
         and C-bit Parity DS3 applications.
         The original Coding Violation counter has been renamed
         to PCV to mean coding violations reported via the P-bits.
         This count is also added for symmetry with the far end
         statistics.

     --  A new Errored Second counter and Severely Errored Second
         counter has been added to count these performance events
         via the C-bits of the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3
         applications.  The original ES and SES counters have been
         renamed to PES and PSES to mean reported via the P-bits.
         These counts are also added for symmetry with the far end
         statistics.

3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS3/E3 interface.  At present, this applies
   to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

        ds3 (30)

   The DS3 definitions contained herein are based on the DS3
   specifications in ANSI T1.102-1987, ANSI T1.107-1988, ANSI T1.107a-
   1990, and ANSI T1.404-1989 [10,11,11a,12].  The E3 definitions
   contained herein are based on the E3 specifications in CCITT G.751
   [14].

3.1.  Use of ifTable for DS1 Layer

   Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.

           ifTable Object    Use for DS1 Layer

                             If no Circuit Identifier has been assigned
                             this object should have an octet string with
                             zero length.

           ifConnectorPresent Set to true(1).


3.2.  Using ifStackTable

   The objects dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex have been deprecated.
   These objects previously allowed a very special proxy situation to
   exist for Routers and CSUs. This section now describes how to use
   ifStackTable to represent this relationship.

   The paragraphs discussing dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex have been
   preserved in Appendix A for informational purposes.

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.
   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3
   interfaces external from the host/DS3/E3-device combination, but also
   the DS3/E3 interfaces connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.  The
   index dsx3IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   |     |     |
   |     +-----+

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:
           ifIndex  Description
           1        Ethernet
           2        Line#A Router

           4        Line#C Router
           5        Line#D Router
           6        Line#A CSU Router
           7        Line#B CSU Router
           8        Line#C CSU Router
           9        Line#D CSU Router
           10       Line#A CSU Network

           12       Line#C CSU Network
           13       Line#D CSU Network

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various DS3 interfaces.

   situation would be identical, except the Ethernet and the 4 router
   interfaces are deleted.  Interfaces would also be numbered from 1 to

3.3.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS3/E3
   signals:  the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   all devices with DS3/E3 interfaces.  As such, a design decision was
   made up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects
   that can generally be read from DS3/E3 devices that are currently
   deployed.

3.4.  DS3/E3 Terminology

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a DS3 interface as monitored by a DS3 device are based on the
   definitions from the ANSI T1.231 standard [13].  If the definition in
   this document does not match the definition in the ANSI T1.231
   document, the implementer should follow the definition described in
   this document.

3.4.1.  Error Events

          Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
            A bipolar violation error event, for B3ZS(HDB3)-coded
            signals, is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity
            as the previous pulse without being part of the zero
            substitution code, B3ZS(HDB3).  For B3ZS(HDB3)-coded
            signals, a bipolar violation error event may also include
            other error patterns such as:  three(four) or more
            consecutive zeros and incorrect polarity. (See T1.231)

          Excessive Zeros (EXZ) Error Event
            An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string length equal
            to or greater than 3 for B3ZS, or greater than 4 for HDB3.
            (See T1.231)

          Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event
            This parameter is a count of both BPVs and EXZs
            occurring over the accumulation period.  An EXZ
            increments the LCV by one regardless of the length
            of the zero string.

          P-bit Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event
            For all DS3 applications, a coding violation error
            event is a P-bit
            Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error event is the
            occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame
            that is not identical to the corresponding locally-
            calculated code. (See T1.231)

          C-bit Coding Violation (CCV) Error Event
            For C-bit Parity and SYNTRAN DS3 applications, this is
            the count of coding violations reported via the C-bits.
            For C-bit Parity, it is a count of CP-bit parity errors
            occurring in the accumulation interval.  For SYNTRAN, it
            is a count of CRC-9 errors occurring in the accumulation
            interval. (See T1.231)


3.4.2.  Performance Parameters

   All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute
   intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an
   agent.  Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the
   agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition,

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DS3/E3 MIB                   October 1995


   there is a rolling 24-hour total of each performance parameter.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of type Gauge32 because it is possible for
   these objects to decrease.  Objects may decrease when Unavailable
   Seconds occurs across a fifteen minutes interval boundary. See
   Unavailable Seconds discussion later in this section.
          Line Errored Seconds (LES)
            A Line Errored Second is a second in which one or more CV
            occurred OR one or more LOS defects.  (See T1.231)

          P-bit Errored Seconds (PES)
            An PES is a second with one or more PCVs OR one or more
            Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS. This
            gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted. (See T1.231)

          P-bit Severely Errored Seconds (PSES)
            A PSES is a second with 44 or more PCVs OR one or more
            Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS. This
            gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted. (See T1.231)

          C-bit Errored Seconds (CES)
            An CES is a second with one or more CCVs OR
            one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
            This count is only for the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3
            applications. This gauge is not incremented when UASs are
            counted. (See T1.231)

          C-bit Severely Errored Seconds (CSES)
            A CSES is a second with 44 or more CCVs OR
            one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
            This count is only for the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3
            applications.  This gauge is not incremented when UASs
            are counted. (See T1.231)

          Severely Errored Framing Seconds (SEFS)
            A SEFS is a second with one or more Out of Frame defects
            OR a detected incoming AIS. (See T1.231)

          Unavailable Seconds (UAS)
            UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that

            the interface is unavailable.  The DS3 interface is said
            to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous PSESs, or
            the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure
            States).  If the condition leading to the failure was
            immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then
            the DS3 interface unavailability starts from the onset of
            these PSESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is
            present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset
            of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs.  Once unavailable,
            and if a failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes
            available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no
            PSESs, if the failure clearing time is less than
            or equal to 10 seconds.  If the failure clearing time is
            more than 10 seconds, the DS3 interface becomes available
            at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, or
            the onset period leading to the successful clearing
            condition, whichever occurs later. With respect to the
            DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented
            while the DS3 interface is deemed available.  While the
            interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is
            incremented is UASs. (See T1.231)

            A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
            crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
            foregoing description implies that the PSES and UAS
            counters for the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted when
            the Unavailable Signal State is entered. Clearly,
            successive GETs of the affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and
            dsx3IntervalUASs objects will return differing values
            if the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of
            the window.  This is viewed as an unavoidable side-effect
            of selecting the presently defined managed objects as
            a basis for this memo.


3.4.3.  Performance Defects

          Failure States:
            The Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) failure, in SYNTRAN
            applications, is declared after detecting
            the Yellow Alarm Signal on the alarm channel.  See ANSI
            T1.107a-1990 [11a]. The Remote Alarm Indication failure,
            in C-bit Parity DS3 applications, is declared
            as soon as the presence of either one or two alarm signals
            are detected on the Far End Alarm Channel.  See [11].

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DS3/E3 MIB                   October 1995


            The Remote Alarm Indication failure may also be declared
            after detecting the far-end SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow).
            The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared as soon as
            the presence of the any of the above alarms are removed.

            Also, the incoming failure state is declared when a defect
            persists for at least 2-10 seconds.  The defects are
            the following:  Loss of Signal (LOS), an Out of Frame (OOF)
            or an incoming Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).
            The Failure State is cleared when the defect is absent
            for less than or equal to 20 seconds.

          Far End SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow)
            A Far End SEF/AIS defect is the occurrence of the two X-bits
            in a M-frame set to zero.  The Far End SEF/AIS defect is
            terminated when the two X-bits in a M-frame are set to
            one. (See T1.231)

          Out of Frame (OOF) defect
            A DS3 OOF defect is detected when any three or more errors
            in sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3
            M-frame.  An OOF defect may also be called a Severely
            Errored Frame (SEF) defect.  An OOF defect is cleared when
            reframe occurs.  A DS3 Loss of Frame (LOF) failure is
            declared when the DS3 OOF defect is consistent for 2 to 10
            seconds.  The DS3 OOF defect ends when reframe occurs.
            The DS3 LOF failure is cleared when the DS3 OOF
            defect is absent for 10 to 20 seconds. (See T1.231)

            An E3 OOF defect is detected when four consecutive frame
            alignment signals have been incorrectly received in there
            predicted positions in an E3 signal. E3 frame alignment
            occurs when the presence of three consecutive frame
            alignment signals have been detected.

          Loss of Signal (LOS) defect
            The DS3 LOS defect is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
            contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
            positive or negative polarity.
            The DS3 LOS defect is terminated upon observing an average
            pulse density of at least 33% over a period of 175 +/- 75
            contiguous pulse positions starting with the receipt of a
            pulse. (See T1.231)

          Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) defect

            The DS3 AIS is framed with "stuck stuffing."  This implies
            that it has a valid M-subframe alignments bits, M-frame
            alignment bits, and P bits.  The information bits are set
            to a 1010... sequence, starting with a one (1) after each
            M-subframe alignment bit, M-frame alignment bit, X bit, P
            bit, and C bit.  The C bits are all set to zero giving
            what is called "stuck stuffing."  The X bits are set to
            one. The DS3 AIS defect is declared after DS3 AIS is
            present in contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or
            greater than T, where 0.2 ms <= T <= 100 ms.
            The DS3 AIS defect is terminated after AIS is absent in
            contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or greater than T.

            The E3 binary content of the AIS is nominally a continuous
            stream of ones.  AIS detection and the application of
            consequent actions, should be completed within a time
            limit of 1 ms. (See T1.231)

          -- for those systems dividing a DS3/E3 into channels
          -- containing different data streams that are of local
          -- interest.

          -- The DS3/E3 fractional table identifies which DS3/E3 channels
          -- associated with a CSU are being used to support a
          -- logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table
          -- from the Internet-standard MIB.

          -- carrying router traffic, a feed for voice, a feed for video,
          -- and a synchronous channel for a non-routed protocol.
          -- We might describe the allocation of channels, in the
          -- dsx3FracTable, as follows:

5.  Appendix A - Use of dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex

   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3
   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different
   indices for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These
   indices are dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex.

   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed
   DS3/E3 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing
   on the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces directly):

   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal
   to ifIndex, and the following applies:

      ifIndex=dsx3IfIndex=dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.

   The dsx3IfIndex column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each
   DS3/E3 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the
   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC1213).

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.
   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3
   interfaces external from the host/DS3/E3-device combination, but also
   the DS3/E3 interfaces connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.  The
   index dsx3IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

           ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                     dsx3LineIndex

                   1                   NA                  NA (Ethernet)
                   2      Line#A   Router Side             6
                   2      Line#A   Network Side            7
                   3      Line#B   Router Side             8
                   3      Line#B   Network Side            9
                   4      Line#C   Router Side            10
                   4      Line#C   Network Side           11
                   5      Line#D   Router Side            12
                   5      Line#D   Network Side           13

   For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.  Note the
   following description of dsx3LineIndex:
   the dsx3LineIndex identifies a DS3/E3 Interface on a managed
   device.  If there is an ifEntry that is directly associated with
   this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it should have the same value
   as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the dsx3LineIndices with an unique
   identifier following the rules of choosing a number greater
   than ifNumber and numbering inside interfaces (e.g., equipment
   side) with even numbers and outside interfaces
   (e.g, network side) with odd numbers.

   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent,
   the situation would be:


           ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                      dsx3LineIndex
