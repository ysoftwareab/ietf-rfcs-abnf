1.  Introduction


   The wide-spread adoption of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has
   resulted in tremendous benefits for both consumers and the industry
   at large.  Productivity gains from inexpensive, easy-to-deploy WLANs
   have fueled growth and development of WLAN equipment and services
   which in turn have attracted more consumers and large enterprises.
   Naturally, such upbeat conditions have encouraged the participation
   of a large number of designers and manufacturers in furthering WLAN
   developments.  Although these advancements are based on the standard
   IEEE 802.11 specifications [IEEE802-11] and individually beneficial,
   when put together however they present a host of incompatibilities
   that ultimately affect the end market.


   In particular, the Architecture Taxonomy [I-D.ietf-capwap-arch]
   illustrates the diversity of WLAN designs currently available in the
   market.  In addition to the three broad WLAN architectures ‚Çô
   autonomous, centralized and distributed ‚Çô there are also local MAC,
   split MAC and remote MAC variations of the centralized architecture.
   The architectures and their variations are unique in their
   characteristics and operational advantages.  For example, the
   autonomous architecture enables highly secure operations due to its
   tight integration of control and WLAN functions.  On the other hand,
   the centralization of key functions in the split MAC model allows for
   cost-effective WLAN deployments.


   It is evident that each of the WLAN designs offers distinct
   capabilities and advantages.  In order to deliver these benefits to
   consumers and enterprises, there is a pressing need to accommodate
   such diversity in an integrated Control and Provisioning of Wireless
   Access Points (CAPWAP) framework.  Fundamental to this is the
   establishment of consistent classifications for the functions that
   comprise WLAN operations and management.  Furthermore, it is
   important to establish a common yardstick with which CAPWAP efforts,
   and particularly draft protocols, may be measured.


   This document is intended to address these issues by way of detailing
   specific requirements for a CAPWAP standard.  Specifically, Section 2
   presents the requirement for enabling different split architectures
   within a single WLAN.  As a precursor, the case for consistent
   classifications of WLAN functions is made.  Next, in Section 3,
   relevant usage scenarios are described.  Then based on the scenarios,
   requirements for CAPWAP are derived in Section 4.

2.  WLAN Functionality Classifications


   The IEEE 802.11 WLAN specifications [IEEE802-11] have been
   interpreted in numerous ways.  This flexibility has allowed for
   varied interpretations that are compliant with the standards.
   However, these interpretations are presently incompatible with each
   other.  As a result, the flexibility of the specifications has
   complicated interoperability.  This is particularly seen in the
   current market space with the wide variety of split architectures.
   The Architecture Taxonomy [I-D.ietf-capwap-arch] clearly shows that
   manufacturers have taken up distinct ways distributing WLAN services
   among network entities.


   In order to address the compatibility issue, the first step is to
   remove ambiguity pertaining to WLAN functionality.  This necessitates
   in establishing a consistent classification for the functions.
   Figure 1 illustrates a particular means of classifications based on
   various WLAN contributions [I-D.ietf-capwap-arch].  These function
   groups are distributed among access controllers (AC) and wireless
   termination points (WTP).

                                Figure 1


   The classification in Figure 1 represents aggregations of functions
   that manufacturers realize in their WLAN systems.  For example, the
   Type 1 classification relates to the radio-over-fibre WTP of
   Architecture 5 whereas Type 5 refers to the AC of Architecture 8
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-arch].


2.1  Policies for Adaptive CAPWAP Interfaces


   Classifications are an initial step for managing the diversity of
   split architectures.  Next, they must be used to configure dissimilar
   WTPs to operate together within a single WLAN.  This section
   describes adaptive CAPWAP interfaces for the purpose of managing
   diversity among WTPs.

   Figure 2 is used to illustrate different policies for adaptive CAPWAP
   interfaces.  It shows a WLAN with a central controller, AC1, capable
   of all five functional classifications.  Each classification is
   denoted by a numbered block.  Associated with AC1 are two dissimilar
   WTPs, capable of different degrees of functionalities.  The remaining
   complementary functionalities required for the two WTPs are left to
   AC1.


                                   AC1
                                 _________

                                 /       \
                                /         \

                                Figure 2


   The first policy is one in which each WTP executes all of its
   functions.  In this case, the set of complementary functions required
   for complete WLAN operations are distinct for each of the WTPs in a
   WLAN.  So with respect to Figure 2, WTP1 would execute all of its
   Types 1, 2 and 3 functions while leaving those of Types 4 and 5 to
   AC1.  WTP2, on the other hand, can only execute Types 1 and 2
   functions and refers to AC1 for all remaining.  Figure 3 illustrates
   this policy where "+" represents functions that a WTP or AC executes
   and "-" represents those that are not executed.  WTP1 and WTP2 both
   execute the entirety of their capable functions.  The remaining set
   of complementary functions is distinct and left to AC1.  AC1 in turn
   executes different sets of complementary functions for each of the
   WTPs.  The result of the first policy is an adaptive CAPWAP interface
   between AC1 and the WTPs.

                                Figure 3


   Such a policy requires AC1 to perform different types of processing
   for frames received from the different WTPs.  There may also be
   variations in context requirements and sequences of processing for
   the different WTPs.  Under this policy, CAPWAP accommodates
   dissimilar WTPs while fully leveraging their individual capabilities.


   It is noted here that an AC operating under the first policy is to be
   capable of performing substantial portions of the complete WLAN
   functions.  Given the prevailing context of ACs being powerful
   switches or routers, the operations required for this policy are
   marginal.  Furthermore, many existing ACs already realize
   considerable components of WLAN functions.


   A second policy for adaptive CAPWAP interfaces involves
   simplification for the AC.  Here, an AC first determines a subset of
   the functions that is common across all the associated WTPs.  This is
   then intimated to the WTPs so that they execute only those functions.
   Then, the remaining set of complementary functions - which is common
   for the WTPs - are taken up by the AC.


   Applying this policy to the network in Figure 2, WTP1 and WTP2 are
   required to execute their common Types 1 and 2 functions.  The
   remaining functions are identically required for both and are
   executed by AC1.  Figure 4 highlights this policy where WTP1 and WTP2
   only execute Types 1 and 2 functions that are common to both.  The
   remaining set of complementary functions is also common and is left
   to AC1.  The notations "+" and "-" are similar to those in Figure 3.
   This policy simplifies the processing at the AC with the possibility
   of some WTPs operating below their full capabilities.

3.  Scenarios for CAPWAP


   It is envisaged that CAPWAP will play a leading role in WLAN
   deployments.  The following are usage scenarios that are to be
   considered for devising a standard protocol.


3.1  WLAN with Heterogeneous Elements


   From Section 2,it is evident that the current market space comprises
   distinct WLAN architectures each delivering unique benefits.
   Consumers and enterprises however, need the combined benefits of all
   architectures.  For instance, it is residential WLAN deployments will
   require both low-cost WTPs in some coverage areas and WTPs with
   enhanced capabilities at others.  The former type is to allow service
   provisions to large common areas while the latter is for services
   within individual residences.  As such, the controller of the
   residential WLAN needs to integrally manage both types of WTPs.


3.2  Sharing of WLAN Infrastructure


   Business realities are now compelling service providers to share
   physical WLAN infrastructure.  This is with the aim of reducing
   capital expenditure and focusing on core competencies.  In
   particular, a number of service providers will cover any given
   hotspot using the same equipment.


   This situation entails subscribers of the various service providers
   be separated and managed distinctly.  Furthermore, given the
   sensitivity of competing businesses, subscribers must be secured from
   cross-service provider threats.  An example to illustrate this
   scenario is given in Appendix A


3.3  Multiple Authentication Mechanisms


   Following from Section 3.2, each service provider generally has their
   own authentication mechanisms with which their subscribers are
   satisfied with.  Some are content to use web based "User" and
   "Password" queries while others use time-limited certificates and
   complex challenge-response sequences.  A grocery shop would use the
   former since wireless access is a side business while a business
   center next door, where wireless is a core service, would employ the
   latter.  These represent different markets.  It is highly likely that
   such distinct authentication mechanisms will have to be offered
   within a common set of WLAN infrastructure.


3.4  Data and Control Separation


   Current WLAN architectures enable switched or routed topologies

   between the AC and WTPs.  As a result of allowing such topologies,
   WTPs may be deployed without being constrained by the limitations of
   physical medium, in particular length of wires.  In addition to the
   benefit of flexibility, these topologies also introduce the drawback
   of latency within AC-WTP communications.  Given the time sensitivity
   of split WLAN operations, especially control aspects, network
   latencies need to be addressed.  A first step in this regard is to
   logically separate different aspects of WLAN operations and control.
   Appendix B provides an example for this scenario.


3.5  Dynamic Topologies


   With interests in mesh networks, the prevalence of dynamic WLAN
   topologies will increase.  WTPs will be capable of being physically
   re-arranged during their operations.  This could be for extending
   coverage or capacity.  For instance, WLAN coverage is needed at a
   seaport during loading and unloading.  So during such times, a WTP
   can be brought out from the WLAN inside a nearby warehouse and
   positioned on the docks.  In this case, the topology of the warehouse
   WLAN changes in that the WTP which was previously wired to the
   warehouse WLAN is now using a wireless link.  This complicates the
   timing aspects of CAPWAP split operations.  Appendix C highlights
   this scenario.


3.6  Failover Support


   Large-scale WLANs involve higher risk of equipment failure or
   malfunction due to the sheer number of network elements.  At the same
   time, wireless networks are playing critical roles in enterprises.
   It is therefore imperative for network services and the underlying
   infrastructure to be continuously available.  Any failures need to be
   discovered and rectified at the earliest.

4.  CAPWAP Requirements


   Based on the scenarios of Section 3, requirements for a CAPWAP
   standard are presented here.


4.1  Adaptive CAPWAP Interfaces


   Given the scenario of Section 3.1, heterogeneous WTPs are to be
   accommodated within a single WLAN controller.  The CAPWAP interface
   between AC and WTP MUST be adaptive based on the policies of Section
   2.1.  The policies MAY be employed statically during WLAN
   initialization or dynamically during active operation.


4.2  Secure Aggregations in Shared WLAN Infrastructures


   CAPWAP needs to address the shared infrastructure scenario of Section
   3.2.  In particular, subscribers from different service providers
   need to be aggregated and kept distinct from each other.  It is also
   important that aggregations be secured in a manner as to avoid
   intermixing of traffic from different service providers.  As a
   requirement, CAPWAP MUST support secure, non-interfering aggregations
   of communications traffic.


4.3  Multiple Authentications Support


   In light of scenario in Section 3.3, large scale WLAN deployments
   increasingly require different forms of authentication for the
   multitude of subscriber groups.  Additionally, there have to be
   adequate means to distinguish between the groups and provide
   appropriate means of verification.  As such, CAPWAP MUST support
   multiple authentication mechanisms and enable them selectively.


4.4  Data and Control Channel Separation


   Section 3.4 illustrates the need for CAPWAP to distinguish between
   different aspects of communications, specifically between data and
   control aspects.  This is to ensure that appropriate priorities may
   be assigned so as to overcome topology latencies and other network
   conditions.  So, as a first step, there MUST be separation of data
   and control channels in CAPWAP.  The separation MAY be logical.
   Additionally, in order to provide relative quality of service, CAPWAP
   MUST support separation of subscriber data traffic into a number of
   sub-data channels.


4.5  Dynamic WLAN Topologies


   From Section 3.5, CAPWAP MUST be operational over dynamically
   changing WLAN topologies.  In particular, some CAPWAP operations MAY

Internet-Draft         Functional Classifications              July 2004



   be bypassed so as to compensate for topology related latencies.


4.6  Failover Support


   The critical nature of WLANs needs to be addressed in CAPWAP.  It
   MUST involve mechanisms to handle failure of WTPs and ACs.


4.7  CAPWAP Design Aspects


   As a general requirement, it is important for CAPWAP to be
   rationalized in terms of number of messages it comprises.  Messages
   and control sequences should be reused where appropriate so as to
   simplify operation.


   CAPWAP efforts should be based on these requirements to ensure that
   the benefits of diverse WLAN designs are integrated in a single
   framework.  The usage scenarios provide an abstraction for CAPWAP
   operations.  Requirements presented here also form a basis for
   measuring standardization efforts.

5.  Conclusion


   This document presents classifications of WLAN functions for the
   purpose of accommodating the diversity of designs within CAPWAP.  A
   set of policies based on the classifications is then described as
   means for achieving this.  The document also illustrates various
   scenarios in which CAPWAP would function.  These follow from various
   contributions made to the Architecture Taxonomy.  Then, based on the
   scenarios, specific CAPWAP requirements are derived.

6.  Security Considerations


   Security is an integral aspect of CAPWAP.  As such, the requirements
   put forth in this document will base their security needs on that of
   the broader CAPWAP goals.

Appendix A.  Shared WLAN Infrastrucuture


   This is an illustration of a the shared WLAN infrastructure from
   Section 3.2 where three service providers, ISP-I, ISP-II and ISP-III,
   share the WLAN infrastructure comprising AC, WTP-1 and WTP-2.  The
   MTs, MT1 through MT5, subscribe to one of the service providers where
   "I", "II" and "III" signify the subscriptions.  A number of
   technologies are used to separate and distinguish subscriber traffic
   within the shared infrastructure.  These include virtual APs and
   VLANs.  For example, on the wireless front, multiple SSIDs, SSID#1
   through SSID#3, are used to distinguish traffic belonging to the
   three ISPs.  Also, on the network front, between AC and the WTPs,
   different VLAns, V1 and V2, are used for each of the WTPs.  As a
   result, different ISPs share WLAN infrastructure and yet offer unique
   services.  Section 3.2 is an increasingly common situation that
   CAPWAP needs to address.

Appendix B.  Channel Separation


   An example for the scenario in Section 3.4 is given here.  Figure 6
   is used as an illustration.  It shows the AC-WTP interface as
   comprising a number of channels for control and data.  The control
   channel, C1, is used to transport configuration, control and status
   information between AC and WTP.  There are multiple data channels, D1
   through Dn, each representing subscriber traffic from a particular
   SSID.  This follows from the current shared infrastructure trend.
   Such separation allows for provisioning each channel based on its
   appropriate sensitivities.

Appendix C.  Dynamic Topologies


   One of the advantages of wireless mesh networks is the ease of
   physical deployment.  This feature will be extended to allow dynamic
   changes in topology during the active operation of a WLAN.  Figure 7
   is an example of such a feature.


   Initially, the WLAN is configured as in topology (1).  Here, WTP1 and
   WTP2 maintain wireline connections to the AC over which they provide
   service to MT1 and MT2, respectively.  Then WTP1 is displaced to an
   alternate location where its wireline connection to AC is
   disconnected.  This is shown in topology (2).  There are a number of
   cases for WTP1 displacing.  For example, in a manufacturing facility,
   network connectivity may be required at the loading bay only during
   dispatch periods.  During such times, a WTP from the main area is
   moved to the loading area.


   In topology (2), the WTP1-AC CAPWAP interface traverses the WTP2-AC
   interface.  So MT1 remains associated with WTP1, and at the same time
   there is a latent association with WTP2.  This introduces timing and
   overhead complications that CAPWAP needs to consider.
