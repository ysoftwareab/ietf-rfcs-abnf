Abstract

   For some time now several equipment manufactures have been 
   implementing what is called L2TP tunnel switching or L2TP multihop.
   Although this technology has several applications and is quite 
   widespread, there has been no effort to standardize the nomenclature 
   and methods associated with it. 
   The goal of this document is to achieve a common denominator in what
   is tunnel switching, its advantages and nomenclature associated with
   it.

1. What is L2TP Tunnel Switching

   L2TP tunneling allows processing of layer2 packets to be divorced 
   from the termination of layer2 circuit. L2TP tunnel switching 
   facilitates moving the termination of a layer2 session further to 
   another LNS potentially unknown to the first LAC. It does so by re-
   tunneling the layer2 session over another L2TP tunnel to a different 
   LNS. The knowledge of whether to switch a layer2 session to another 
   L2TP tunnel can be static or dynamic (for example when a PPP session 
   is established). 

 _______           _______            _______ _______          _______
|  L2   |         |       |          |       |       |        |       |
| User  |         | LAC A |          | LNS A | LAC B |        | LNS B |
|_______|         |_______|          |_______|_______|        |_______|
        

|------ L2- ------|

                  |---- L2/L2TP ----|

                                     |-- L2 --|

                                              |------ L2/L2TP -------|

                                     |------- tunnel switching ------|


   The figure above presents a typical tunnel switching scenario. The 
   user opens a layer2 (for example PPP) session to LAC A, which puts 
   the layer2 session into a L2TP tunnel that terminates on LNS A. If 
   LNS A decides to further tunnel the layer2 session, it puts the 
   layer2 session on another L2TP tunnel originating on LAC B and 
   terminating on LNS B. LNS A and LAC B reside on the same device.  

   The process of getting the layer2 session terminating on LNS A and 
   further tunneling it to another LNS, in the example above LNS B, is 
   called tunnel switching. 

2. Tunnel Switching Nomenclature

   Ingress Tunnel Aggregator (ITA): These devices are represented by 
   the first layer of LACs, represented in the picture by LAC A. This 
   is he node which terminates layer2 circuit and initiates the first 
   L2TP tunnel.





Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 3]


Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001


   Tunnel Switching Aggregator (TSA): These are the devices that act as 
   LNS as well as LAC for a particular layer2 session therefore it 
   typically re-tunnels layer2 session to another LNS. The TSA is 
   composed of two parts: the TSA-LAC and the TSA-LNS.

   Egress Tunnel Aggregator (ETA): These are devices that terminate the 
   layer2 session. They are represented in the picture by LNS B.

3. Why L2TP Tunnel Switching

   This section discusses the advantages of L2TP tunnel switching. 

 * Often, the administrative domain of a LAC, an ILEC or CLEC, is not  
   same as that of LNS, typically an ISP terminating subscriber's    
   Layer2 connection. In such situations, a multi tier deployment with
   tunnel switching helps the LEC (ILEC or CLEC) mask its internal 
   network architecture from the ISPs. In particular, it eases the 
   configuration across different administrative domain. For example,
   for every new ITA added in the system, ISP doesn't need to 
   reconfigure its LNSs  - for them LACs are always same (TSAs).

 * L2TP tunnel switching divorces the location of "decision-maker" LNS.
   Certain deployments do not have decision-making capabilities on LAC 
   For example PC based LACs might not have mechanisms to be configured
   with policies a service provider wants to adopt; On other hand, it
   might not be desirable to expose such policies to every customer LAC 
   CPE. The decision to choose the right LNS, for load balancing or 
   other administrative purposes, when multiple LNSs are available, 
   might not be done best by the first LAC always. Not all LACs should 
   be expected to exhibit such rich functionality, features and 
   flexibility. 

 * L2TP tunnel switching allows using a common L2TP tunnel on LAC for 
   sessions that are actually destined to different LNSs. This enables
   wholesaling layer2 sessions destined to any LNS go over a few 
   tunnels.

 * L2TP tunnel switching might reduce the total number of tunnels in a 
   meshed environment. The advantage of fewer tunnels would primarily 
   be in a configuration and provisioning ease. The reduction of 
   tunnels can be seen from three different angles, from the entire 
   system, from the ITA and from the last ETA point of view. 

 * Entire System

   In a traditional deployment, the total number of L2TP sessions   
   between N LACs (ITA) and M LNSs (ETA) is N*M, assuming there is 
   at least one layer2 session from every LAC that needs to be 
   terminated on each LNS. With tunnel switching, this number can be
   reduced to (#ETA + #ITA) * (#TSA).

Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 4]


Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001



     Of course the advantage on the reduction of tunnels in the system 
     only holds when the (#TSA)is less than the number of LNS1s (see 
     picture below). 

   * ITA

     From the first layer of LACs point of view, the reduction in the 
     number of tunnels holds whenever ITA*TSA < TSA*ETA, which is true 
     for most deployments.

   * ETA

     On the other hand, the advantage on the reduction of tunnels from 
     the last LNS (LNS2) point of view in comparison with LNS1 is 
     considerable, since the M*(#TSA) is usually much less than M*N.

4. Disadvantages of L2TP tunnel switching:

 * Focal point of failure: As TSA aggregates more and more tunnels, 
   it becomes a focal point for failure, as compared to if ITAs had 
   tunnels to ETAs directly. 

 * Multiple Negotiations: Subscriber might be authenticated/LCP 
   multiple times because each TSA might have its own criteria to 
   determine if subscriber should be authenticated or if LCP parameters 
   negotiated (proxy-LCP) are appropriate. 






Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 5]


Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001


 * Session limit within an L2TP tunnel: Bundling sessions within a 
   single L2TP tunnel makes one deployment more likely to hit the 65k 
   limit inherent of the L2TP protocol faster than if you have unique 
   tunnels. Care should be taken while deploying L2TP tunnel switching 
   to not exceed this limit due to aggregation of various sessions in 
   limited number of tunnels.


5. Extensions to enhance tunnel switching support

   In this section we present new AVPs (and motivation behind them) 
   that can enhance tunnel switching support beyond what is usually 
   deployed today. These extensions are only applicable for L2TP tunnel 
   switching.

5.1 Problem Statement

   When an TSA <-> ETA tunnel collapses for one reason or another (link 
   failure, etc), the initial ITA<->TSA link continues to function 
   normally, even though there is nowhere for the layer2 traffic to go 
   once it gets to this TSA point. This causes a major disruption of 
   service impact, as several subscribers who were knocked off the 
   network will not be able to get back on the network.  This creates a 
   "black hole" condition, which directs all new sessions to the TSA, 
   which has no path to the ETA. All new session attempts for this ETA 
   fail.

5.2 Tunnel Set Dependency

   A new object L2TP Dependency should be defined to maintain a 
   relationship between the ITA to TSA tunnels and the TSA to ETA 
   tunnels. 

   This object can be utilized by ITA to route away L2TP sessions from 
   failures in the TSA to ETA connection. Information about failures 
   between TSA and ETA should be provided to ITA through a new set of 
   AVPs defined below. 

5.3 Tunnel Dependency Load AVP (All Control Messages)
 
   The Tunnel Dependency Load AVP, Attribute Type XS, indicates the 
   capacity to carry L2TP sessions from TSA to ETA for certain 
   "service profile" (e.g., a ISP or Domain Name)

   






Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 6]


Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001


   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                  Number of Services Profiles                  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | SPN Length    | Service Profile Name ... (arbitrary length)   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Maximum  Load                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Current Load                            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


      The Number of Services Profiles indicates the number of 
      occurrences of the tuple (Service Profile Name, Maximum Load, 
      Current Load).

      The Service Profile Name is up to 256 bytes long, but MUST be at 
      least 1 octet. This name should be as broadly unique as possible, 
      because the tunnels between ITA to TSA can contain sessions for 
      different service profiles. 

      The Maximum Load indicates the Maximum reference capacity for a 
      service profile. It could be the number of maximum tunnels 
      supported by the system at a point in time, maximum amount of 
      bandwidth, or some other metric that reflects ratio 

      The Current Load indicated the current capacity of the system, it 
      could be the number of active tunnels at a point in time, amount 
      of utilized bandwidth, or some other metric that reflects ratio. 

      This AVP MAY be be hidden (the H-bit can be either 0 or 1). The 
      M-bit for this AVP MUST be set to 0.  

5.4. Loop Prevention AVP

   The Loop Prevention AVP, Attribute Type TBD, can be used to detect 
   the existence of loops in the TSA network.  

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Number of Nodes                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | HN Length     |          HostName ... (arbitrary length)      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                   IP address of the Node                      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 7]


Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001


      The Number of Nodes indicates the occurrences of the tuple (Host
      Name, IP Address). Each tuple identifies a node in the tunnel-
      switched-path.

      The Hostname is MUST be same as used on the Hostname AVP when the 
      tunnel was established.

      The IP address field represents the IP address which was used to
      establish the tunnel.
      
      This AVP is updated by LAC when a new tunnel is being 
      established. It adds (Hostname, IP address) tuple to the existing 
      AVP and increments Number of Nodes.


5.5 CDN Messages and L2TP Tunnel Switching

   The Call-Disconnect-Notify (CDN) message is an L2TP control message 
   sent either by the LAC or LNS to request disconnection of a specific 
   call within the L2TP tunnel. Its purpose is to inform the peer of 
   the disconnection and the reason why it occurred.

   As an indication to its use, an Incoming-Call-Request message is  
   generated by the LAC when the subscriber's call is detected. The LAC 
   selects a Session ID and sends the Incoming-Call-Request to the LNS; 
   it then waits for a response from the LNS - keeping the subscribers 
   call waiting. It is at this point that the LNS may decline to accept 
   the call 
 
   It is also understood that if the call is terminated before the LNS 
   accepts it, a Call-Disconnect-Notify is sent by the Calling LAC to 
   indicate this condition, and is understood to be catered for within 
   current L2TP implementation. Any CDN messages originating from the 
   LAC are therefore omitted from the scope of this proposal, however 
   the Calling LAC must interpret the CDN messages received from the   
   LNS correctly, and must take the appropriate steps to ensure that 
   the intention of the CDN messages are carried out as expected.

   In the case where an L2TP Tunnel Switch has successfully extended 
   the Control Connection to the ETA, and it returns general CDN 
   messages during session establishment, any such messages may be 
   passed transparently through to the ITA or may be interpreted by the 
   TSA; such scenarios are included.








Penno, et al.                                                  [Page 8]


Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001


   The following is proposed with regards of tunnel switching and CDN 
   messages:

   o  To define the circumstances that warrants the ETA to send general 
      protocol CDN messages to the LAC over and above all other 
      signaling mechanisms defined in RFC2661.
   o  To include decisions that may be undertaken by an TSA.
   o  To include assurances that multiple TSA peering is supported.


5.6 Scenarios for generating CDN messages

   The proposed causes and recommended LNS generated CDN messages for 
   each scenario are documented here.

5.6.1 LNS specific CDN Message

   Here the TSA-LNS or Peering LNS cannot accept another Session and 
   signals to the downstream LAC.

   o The TSA-LNS or Peering LNS reaches a pre-determined threshold, 
     this may be administrative or it may be a system function. As a 
     result, CDN Code-7 is generated by the LNS and passed to the 
     downstream LAC.

   The downstream LAC should change the state of the upstream peer to 
   'busy' and apply an administrative hold-down. Thereafter the TSA-LAC 
   or ITA should try all possible LNS peers - if there are no 
   available LNS peers the CDN Code should be passed to the downstream 
   LAC by the TSA-LNS only. The Calling LAC may choose to clear the 
   call.

5.6.2 TSA-LAC specific CDN Message

   This scenario only affects the TSA-LAC, which cannot establish 
   another session due to it reaching the aggregate session limit.

   o If the TSA-LAC exceeds max-sessions then it may signal to the 
     TSA-LNS to generate a CDN Code-4 for the downstream LAC. 

   The downstream LAC should change the state of the upstream peer to  
   'busy' and apply an administrative hold-down. Thereafter the TSA-LAC 
   or Calling LAC should try all possible LNS peers - if there are no 
   available LNS peers the CDN Code should be passed to the downstream 
   LAC by the TSA-LNS only. The Calling LAC may choose to clear the 
   call.

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-l2tpext-switching-01.txt   September, 2001


5.6.3 Calling LAC Control Connection failures

   If there is a problem for the LAC to establish an L2TP tunnel,   
   because the Control Connection to the LNS is down, then a general 
   CDN message may or may not be appropriate depending upon the LAC 
   type. Three scenarios are mentioned here.

   o The Calling LAC cannot establish a Control Connection with the 
     Peering LNS.

   If the Calling LAC cannot continue with a session because there is   
   no Control Channel then it should try another L2TP peer. The Calling 
   LAC should record the unavailability of the Peering LNS and mark it 
   as unavailable for a period of time that is determined by the 
   Administrator.

   o The TSA-LAC cannot establish a Control Connection with the 
     upstream LNS

   If the TSA-LAC cannot continue with a session because there is no 
   Control Channel then a CDN Code-1 message may be generated by the 
   TSA-LNS to signal to the upstream LAC to try another L2TP peer. 

   The TSA-LAC should change the state of the upstream peer to 'dead'    
   and apply an administrative hold-down. Thereafter the TSA-LAC should 
   try all possible LNS peers - if there are no available LNS peers the 
   CDN Code should be passed to the downstream LAC by the TSA-LNS only. 

   o Calling LAC receives CDN Code-1

   If the Calling LAC receives CDN Code-1, then it should try another 
   L2TP peer. The Calling LAC should record the unavailability of the 
   upstream LNS and mark it as unavailable for a period of time that is 
   determined by the Administrator. The Calling LAC will thereafter 
   clear the call.

5.6.4 LNS Session Failure

   Unable to accept the incoming call the peer LNS may return the  
   correct CDN message defined above or it may be unaware of these 
   requirements.

   The following are therefore best provided by implementation since 
   there are a number of options that may be selected.

   * The Administrator may choose to interpret all CDN messages 
     generated by the upstream LNS. This is typically because the LNS 
     employs the CDN Codes defined above (and may be implemented as the 
     default option).

   * The Administrator may choose to ignore the CDN messages generated 
     by the upstream LNS, and by so doing may alert the downstream LAC 
     to mark it as unavailable for a period of time. This is typically 
     due to the upstream LNS being unaware of the CDN Codes defined 
     above.

   * The Administrator may choose to relay any CDN messages generated  
     by the upstream LNS transparently through to the downstream LAC. 
     This caters for the scenario where the TSA is not interpreting the 
     CDN Codes correctly or the topology does not lend itself to the 
     TSA intercepting CDN messages.
