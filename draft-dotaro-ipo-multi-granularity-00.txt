Abstract

   In this memo we aim at demonstrating the benefits from the
   introduction in optical networks of the optical multi-granularity
   concept. Optical system technologies are able to handle different
   switching granularities from wavelength to fiber and especially
   wavebands. Taking benefits from these technologies, switching larger
   granularities reduce at the same time the complexity of control
   operations, the amount of hardware in the optical layer, and in
   addition relax some physical constraints. Gains expected from the

   approach are partly function of the efficiency of the grooming of
   wavelengths into larger granularities. In particular, intelligent
   intermediate grooming makes the multi-granularity concept even more
   attractive since reducing the required size of optical switching
   matrix typically by a factor of two or more. The proposed concept
   has to be seen as a new set of optical network features that are
   compliant and/or implying limited extensions to the Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) protocol suite.

   multiple Terabit/s. Hence the switching capacity of backbone nodes
   has to scale up to thousands of wavelength ports. To overcome the
   bottleneck of electronic switching, wavelength cross-connects (WXC)
   are introduced with Terabit/s throughput.

   Optical technologies can also be used to switch larger granularities
   such as bands of wavelengths (also referred to as wavebands) and
   fibers. Considering that optical networks will not experience a
   significant evolution of their topology properties (connectivity,
   number of nodes), these new granularities will easily support the
   traffic growth with limited impact on efficiency.

   The main issue is to find the optimum way to arrange the spatial
   distribution of traffic flows on the topology in order to create
   connections at the different optical granularities. The intrinsic
   properties of a typical backbone network give us good perspectives
   to achieve the goal of provisioning LSPs at these granularities. The
   relatively limited number of nodes (tens of nodes) and the relative
   small connectivity (3 to 8 neighbors per node) allow us to assume
   that there will be a strong correlation between flows of traffic
   inside the network. In other terms, it means that, assuming an
   efficient planning, numerous flows (e.g. STM-N/OC-N or IP flows)
   have to be processed in the same way in the nodes. Thus, this should
   give the opportunity to establish wavelength, waveband and fiber
   connections, and process most of the traffic using optical
   granularities as large as possible. This will alleviate some
   capacity bottlenecks and above all reduce the network cost.

   In this memo, we propose to use this concept of multiple optical
   granularities in association with grooming strategies and GMPLS
   integration requirements. Among possible optical switching
   granularities, waveband is an attractive trade-off for foreseen
   traffic volumes in next few years and will be particularly
   considered in the following. For this purpose, waveband switching is
   introduced as an additional sub-layer between the Lambda and the
   Fiber layer i.e. between corresponding Lambda-LSP (wavelength
   switching) and Fiber-LSP (spatial switching). However, this sub-
   layer does not introduce either a new type of interface or a new
   class of Forwarding Adjacencies (FA) class since we consider a
   Lambda LSP (L-LSP) as a particular case of a more generic Waveband
   LSP (WB-LSP) as described in Section 4.

   In terms of grooming strategies, we also propose to have both end-
   to-end and intermediate grooming at waveband and fiber levels to
   make the concept more attractive. Intermediate grouping is referred
   to as the aggregation of traffic with different source nodes and/or
   different destination nodes but with a common sub-path in the
   optical layer. End to end grooming is a particular case of
   intermediate grooming where the sub-path in the optical layer is the
   entire optical path between source and destination.

3. Concept Definition

3.1 Multi-Granularity definition

   The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability to
   simultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a given
   optical network. The granularities we considered inside optical
   networks are single wavelengths (L-LSP), bundles of wavelengths
   which we call wavebands (WB-LSP), and whole fibers (F-LSP). There
   may be different levels of waveband in the multi-granularity optical
   networks.

   The main idea behind multi-granularity inside optical networks is
   that the number of nodes inside a given network is limited, and if a
   lot of wavelengths are required to carry all the traffic, some of
   them will start from the same source node to go to the same
   destination nodes, and even more wavelengths will follow the same
   sub-paths inside the network. Thus it is useless to switch them
   separately through some optical nodes, they can be switched by
   groups (wavebands, or even fibers if there are a lot of
   wavelengths).

3.2 Multi-Granularity-OXC Architecture

   A Multi-Granularity Optical Cross-Connect (MG-OXC) extends classic
   WXC (wavelength switching only) to support switching of other kind
   of optical granularities or LSPs. Therefore a MG-OXC can either
   switch wavelengths, wavebands or fiber LSPs, or a combination of
   any.

   By these means, such a Cross-Connect is capable of terminating L-
   LSPs through a Lambda Switching Capable interface (LSC), WB-LSPs
   through Waveband Switching Capable interface (WBSC) and F-LSPs
   through Fiber Switching Capable (FSC) interface.

   The following figure shows a possible architecture of a MG-OXC. The
   MG-OXC considered has the ability to switch the three types of LSPs
   but this is not mandatory.

   Moreover different architectures can be envisaged, depending on the
   degree of flexibility one wants to have. The architecture shown in
   the above figure is the most generic one. It combines the
   functionality of both the static and flexible architectures.

   The static architecture presents the lowest degree of flexibility.
   Indeed if one wants to terminate an L-LSP (resp. WB-LSP) at this
   node he has to make sure to switch the LSP in the right waveband and
   fiber (resp. fiber). On the contrary the flexible architecture gives
   the possibility to dynamically redirect higher order LSPs (F-LSPs,
   WB-LSPs) to lower order ones (L-LSPs, WB-LSPs) through the switching
   fabric and demultiplexers, and vice-versa. Note that the possible
   architectures have different impact on LSPs switching but also on
   the physical performance.

   Wavelength (resp. WaveBand) conversion may be required at the WXC

   (resp. WB-XC) outputs, and regeneration may also be required at the
   input and/or output fibers like in classical OXC architectures, but
   they are not represented here.

3.3. Grooming strategies

   One of the interests of multi-granularity is to simplify switching
   procedures of numerous Lambda-LSPs. This is achieved by forming
   groups of Lambda-LSPs and switching them as a single entity. The
   groups formed are waveband LSPs or fiber LSPs.

   The grooming strategy consists in forming Waveband-LSPs and/or
   Fiber-LSPs (resp. Fiber-LSPs) with Lambda-LSPs (resp. Waveband-LSPs)
   which do not have the same source or/nor destination in the optical
   network but, which share a common sub-path across this network. This
   grooming method is called intermediate grooming with regards to end-
   to-end grooming. End-to-end grooming can be seen as a peculiar case
   of intermediate grooming. End-to-end grooming consists in forming
   higher order LSPs with lower order ones, which have the same source
   and the same destination in the optical network.

   End-to-end grooming is the simplest strategy, but it is the
   combination of both end-to-end and intermediate grooming strategies,
   which is clearly the most efficient (see Section 3.4). Note that one
   could decide to form and then establish a waveband or fiber LSP even
   if this LSP cannot be fully filled with Lambda-LSPs.

   The following example illustrates these grooming strategies.


      ---                                                   ---

            \                                           /

              | C |-------| D |-------| E |-------| F |

             /                                         \
            /                                           \
           /                                             \
          /                                               \
      ---/                                                 \---
     | B |                                                 | H |
      ---                                                   ---


   Let us consider in this example that wavebands are composed of 4
   wavelengths and that fibers are composed of 4 wavebands.

   Let us also consider 9 L-LSPs from A to G and 7 L-LSPs from B to H.

IPO Working Group                                                    6

draft-dotaro-ipo-multi-granularity-00.txt                    July 2001


   With end-to-end grooming 8 out of the 9 L-LSPs from A to G could be
   nested in two WB-LSPs, leaving one L-LSP. In the same manner 4 of
   the 7 L-LSPs from B to H could be nested in one WB-LSP leaving 3
   L-LSPs.

   This would result in having 3 WB-LSPs and 4 L-LSPs between C and F
   which, could in turn be nested in a F-LSP between these nodes using
   intermediate grooming strategy.

3.4 Benefits of the approach

   In optical networks, the main benefits of the multi-granularity
   approach with waveband switching are the reduction of the number of
   connections inside each optical cross-connect. This means from the
   hardware point of view a reduction of the number of ports both for
   the switches and for the optical multiplexers and demultiplexers.
   With waveband switching, the cost of switching and (de)multiplexing
   is shared between a group of N (typically N=4 or 8) wavelengths.
   With fiber switching, when one can switch a whole fiber in the node,
   the cost of switching is shared by more wavelengths (typically 40,
   80, etc.) and there is no demultiplexing. The multi-granularity
   approach will thus decrease the total cost of each optical node
   inside the network.

   To illustrate this point, for an optical node which switches 1000
   wavelengths without the multi-granularity approach, the number of
   ports can be decreased up to more than 75% (see [OFC01-MGOXC]) with
   the introduction of multi-granularity and waveband switching inside
   the optical network, using the grooming strategy defined in part 3.3
   (end-to-end grouping and intermediate grouping) and the node
   architecture given in Section 3.2. This reduction is even more
   important for higher node capacity.

   The other benefits of multi-granularity and waveband switching is
   also to make the design of optical nodes easier by decreasing
   optical losses (and thus relaxing the constraints on optical
   amplification) and by reducing the issue of optical filter cascade
   (no filtering with fiber switching, easier filtering with waveband
   switching compared to wavelength switching). Of course this easier
   design of optical nodes will decrease the total cost of the whole
   optical network.

4. Concept integration in Generalized MPLS

4.1 Multi-Granularity Hierarchy

   The following definitions are proposed in order to improve the
   current LSP hierarchy defined in [MPLS-LSP] used to specify the LSP
   multiplexing capabilities of TE links:

   - Waveband

     . A waveband is a "grouping" of N wavelengths of the same capacity

IPO Working Group                                                    7

draft-dotaro-ipo-multi-granularity-00.txt                    July 2001


       (bit-rate).
     . The number of wavelengths within a given waveband is
       configurable but hardware dependent - i.e. number of ports in
       de/multiplexer, de/multiplexer specifications in terms of
       spectrum width, spacing,...
     . Each of these wavelengths represents (i.e. transports) one given
       Lambda-LSP i.e. an L-LSP.

   - Waveband-LSP (WB-LSP)

     . A WB-LSP includes one or more (N) L-LSP and is transported 
       across MG-OXC in one (or more than one) waveband(s).

   Notice that waveband nesting (i.e. wavebands into wavebands) is
   possible but add unnecessary complexity. Therefore this concept is
   not studied in this document.

   - Fiber

     . A fiber is a grouping of M wavebands.
     . Wavebands within a fiber can either be contiguous or interleaved
       depending on the capabilities of the system hardware
       (multiplexer, demultiplexer).
     . The number of wavebands within a given fiber is configurable but
       hardware dependent - i.e. number of ports in de/multiplexer,
       de/multiplexer specifications in terms of spectrum width,
       spacing,...

   - Fiber-LSP (F-LSP)

     . A F-LSP includes one or more (M) WB-LSP and is transported
       across MG-OXC in one single fiber.

   Given the above definition of the Multi-Granularity hierarchy, a
   Lambda-LSP (L-LSP) can now be considered as a particular case of a
   Waveband-LSP (WB-LSP) defined when the number of wavelengths within
   a waveband is N=1.

   The following figure illustrates the Multi-Granularity hierarchy
   defined here above:


    Lambda[1]  Lambda[2] ... Lambda[N]
       |          |             |

4.2 LSP Hierarchy

   The [GMPLS-ARCH] document considers waveband switching a particular
   case of lambda switching. As specified, a waveband represents a set
   of contiguous wavelengths, which can be switched together to a new
   waveband. However, this waveband switching definition doesnÆt
   introduce a new LSP Encoding Type. This means that the corresponding
   generalized label sent back to the upstream node precludes the usage
   of wavelength label on such links. Moreover, such a definition
   assumes that the underlying layer (spatial switching layer) is
   dedicated to support only waveband switching.

   Since the scope of this document is to introduce multi-granularity
   at the optical layer, one has to extend this definition and consider
   a Lambda-LSP (L-LSP) as a particular case of Waveband-LSP (WB-LSP).
   Taking into account the previous definition of the Multi-Granularity
   hierarchy, the LSP Hierarchy can be represented as follows if we
   except the TDM-LSP layer:


                       Packet-LSP  <---> PSC Interface
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            v
                      Waveband-LSP <---> WBSC Interface
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            v
                        Fiber-LSP  <---> FSC Interface


   Therefore, we consider here that a WBSC interface behaves by 
   default as an LSC interface when the number of wavelength comprised 
   into a specific waveband is equal to 1.

4.3 Impact on GMPLS Protocol Suite

4.3.1 GMPLS Signalling

   As described in [GMPLS-SIG], waveband switching definition
   implicitly refers to an inverse multiplexing mechanism were one can
   request a 10 Gbps L-LSP while the underlying wavelength have a 2.5
   Gbps bit-rate. Therefore, when requesting such L-LSP four labels are

   returned back to the upstream node as waveband label (see Section
   3.3 in [GMPLS-SIG]).

   Here, the definition of a waveband requires defining a Multiplier
   field as it is already the case in [GMPLS-SSS] and [GMPLS-G709].
   This because at the opposite of the inverse multiplexing case the
   upper layer must preserve the visibility of the L-LSP embedded into
   the waveband. Since the Multiplier enables to setup N x L-LSP, one
   can suggest to use this definition in order to define a Waveband-LSP
   (WB-LSP).

   When requesting an L-LSP the Multiplier field (MT field) would be
   equal to 1 and when requesting a Waveband including N wavelengths
   the Multiplier field will be equal to N. However, in order to
   preserve backward compatibility with the current Generalized Label
   Request defined in [GMPLS-SIG] Section 3.1, one could also define an
   additional dedicated flag in order to determine whether or not the
   Multiplier field must be considered. Therefore, when this flag is
   set to zero, the current Lambda-LSP Label Request is left unchanged.

4.3.2 GMPLS Traffic-Engineering Routing Extensions

   Clearly, the support of interfaces with multiple switching (i.e.
   multiplexing) capabilities such as LSC (Lambda Switching Capable),
   WBSC (Waveband Switching Capable) and FSC (Fiber Switching Capable)
   must be flooded through the use of an IGP routing protocol such as
   OSPF and IS-IS. For this purpose extensions of the Link Multiplexing
   Capability defined in [MPLS-HIER] can be considered.

   For this purpose, one could propose to enhance the traffic-
   engineering extensions defined for GMPLS purposes (see [GMPLS-OSPF-
   TE] and [GMPLS-ISIS-TE]) by extending the Link Multiplexing
   Capability sub-TLV (type 10) of the Link-TLV as defined for OSPF in
   [MPLS-HIER]. For IS-IS, the same enhancement can be provided to the
   Link Multiplex Capability which is defined as a sub-TLV in [MPLS-
   HIER] of the extended IS reachability TLV (type 22) as specified in
   [ISIS-TE].

   Additionally, it seems also quite reasonable to use a dedicated sub-
   TLV to indicate the min/max number of wavelength (N) and the min/max
   number of waveband (M) supported respectively by WBSC interfaces and
   FSC interfaces. These capabilities could be included in a dedicated
   sub-TLV similarly to the one defined in [GMPLS-IGP-709].

4.3.3 Requirement Statements

   For the first step of multi-granularity approach, very few
   modifications or extensions are needed, as described in the above
   sections.

   A more complete and optimized multi-granularity optical network will
   require further enhancements to the GMPLS Signaling and TE-Routing

   protocols. Those requirements are for further study since impacting
   several working groups of the sub-IP area.
