          Use-cases for Traffic Steering in Operator Networks
                     draft-luo-grow-ts-use-cases-01

Abstract

   Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire of
   differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the

   their benefits at the same time.

   This document lists some typical use cases for traffic steering
   services.  This document does not attempt to enumerate all kinds of
   scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of these
   scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.

1.  Introduction

   Transporting data to their users through operators' networks is a
   fundamental service that can benefit both providers and consumers.

   Since data/information transport is playing a key role nowadays,
   operators have to face this increasing challenge through satisfying
   services with differentiated criterias, such as latency, throughput,
   reliability and even user-defined constraints.  Moreover, the
   internet traffic changes rapidly and is hard to be predicted, so

Internet-DrafTraffic Steering Use Case in Operator Networks    June 2016


   there is chance that operators' networks will be congested.  However,
   the network capacity expansion takes time and could not meet the
   differentiated service requirement or solve the congestion problem in
   time.  As a result, it's nessesary to introduce traffic steering
   techniques into operators' networks.

   This document lists some typical use cases for traffic steering in
   ISP networks and OTT networks.  It does not attempt to enumerate all
   kinds of scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of
   these scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.

2.  Terminology

   o  QoS: Quality of Service

   o  ISP: Internet Service Provider

   o  MAN: Metropolitan Area Network

   o  OTTSP: Over the Top Service Provider, or Content Operator

   o  AR: Access Router

3.  Use cases and Requirements

3.1.  Business-oriented Steering

   It is a reasonable commercial way to provide multiple paths to the
   same destination with differentiated experiences to preferential
   users/services.  This is an efficient approach to maximize providers'
   network resources as well as their profit and offer more choices to
   network users.

   Figure 1 Differentiated Path Selection for Different User

   In the above ISP network, there are three kinds of users in Sydney,
   saying Gold, Silver and Bronze, and they wish to visit website
   located in HongKong.  The ISP provides three different paths with
   different experiences according to users' priority.  The Gold Users
   may use Path1 with less latency and loss.  The Silver Users may use
   the Path2 through Singapore with less latency but maybe some
   congestion there.  The Bronze Users may use Path3 through LA with
   some latency and loss.

   As depicted above, the OTTSP has 3 exits with one ISP, which are
   located in City A, City B and City C.  The content is obtained from
   Content Server and send to the exits through AR. an OTTSP may make
   its steering strategy based on different services.  For example, the
   OTTSP in the graph above may choose exit R21 for video service and
   exit R22 for web service, which REQUIREs a mechanism/system exists to
   identify different services from traffic flow.

3.1.3.  Derived Requirements

   o  REQ01: A classification mechanism/system is REQUIRED to identify
      users' priority from user traffic or to identify different
      services from traffic flow.

   o  REQ02: A decision procedure/mechanism for path selection is
      REQUIRED to exist to decide traffic forwarding strategy based on
      the input from a classification mechanism.

3.2.  Traffic Congestion Mitigation

   It is a persistent goal for providers to increase the utilization
   ratio of their current network resources, and to mitigate the traffic
   congestion.  Traffic congestion is possible to happen anywhere in the
   ISP network(MAN, IDC, core and the links between them), because
   internet traffic is hard to predict.  For example, there might be
   some local online events that the network operators didn't know
   beforehead, or some sudden attack just happened.  Even for the big
   events that can be predicted, such as annual online discount of
   e-commerce company, or IOS update of Apple Inc, we could not
   guarantee there is no congestion.  What is more, the network capacity
   expansion is usually an annual operation, which could be delayed by
   any links of the engineering.  As a result, the temporary traffic
   steering is always needed.  The same thing happens to the OTT
   networks as well.

   It should be noted that, the traffic steering is absolutely not a
   global behavior.  It just acts on part of the network, and it's
   temporary.

                            +----------+

   Figure 3 An Example of Congestion Mitigation in Core

   As depicted above, traffic from MAN C1 to MAN D2 follows the path
   Core C->Core B->Core D as the primary path, but somehow the load
   ratio becomes too much.  It is reasonable to transfer some traffic
   load to less utilized path Core C->Core A->Core D when the primary
   path has congestion.

   Figure 4 An Example of Congestion Mitigation among ISPs

   As depicted above, ISP1 and ISP2 are interconnect by 3 exits which
   are located in 3 cities respectively.  The links between ISP1 and
   ISP2 in the same city are called local links, and the rest are long
   distance links.  Traffic from IXP C1 to Core A in ISP 2 usually
   passes through link IXP C1->IXP A2->Core A.  This is a long distant
   route, directly connecting city C and city A.  Part of traffic could
   be transferred to link IXP C1->IXP B1->IXP A1->IXP A2->Core A when
   the primary route congest.

3.2.3.  An Example of Congestion Mitigation at International Edge

   An ISP usually interconnects with more than 2 transit networks at the
   international edge, so it is quite common that multiple paths may
   exist for the same foreign destination.  Usually those paths with
   better QoS properties such as latency, loss, jitter and etc are often
   preferred.  Since these properties keep changing from time to time,
   the decision of path selection has to be made dynamically.

   Figure 5 An Example of Congestion Mitigation at International Edge

   As depicted above, the traffic to the foreign destination H from IP
   core network (AS C1) has two choices on transit network, saying
   Transit A and Transit B.  Under normal conditions, Transit B is the
   primary choice, but Transit A will be preferred when the QoS of
   Transit B gets worse.  As a result, the same traffic will go through
   Transit A instead.
