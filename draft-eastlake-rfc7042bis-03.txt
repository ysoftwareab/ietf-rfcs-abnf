                   draft-eastlake-rfc7042bis-03.txt


Abstract

   Some IETF protocols make use of Ethernet frame formats and IEEE 802
   parameters.  This document discusses several uses of such parameters
   in IETF protocols, specifies IANA considerations for assignment of
   points under the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), and
   provides some values for use in documentation.  This document
   obsoletes RFC 7042.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


1. Introduction

   Some IETF protocols use Ethernet or other IEEE 802-related
   communication frame formats and parameters [IEEE802].  These include
   MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and protocol identifiers.

   This document specifies IANA considerations for the assignment of
   code points under the IANA OUI including MAC addresses and protocol
   identifiers.  It also discusses several other uses by the IETF of
   IEEE 802 code points, including IEEE 802 Connectivity Fault
   Management (CFM) code points [RFC7319], and provides some values for
   use in documentation.  As noted in [RFC2606] and [RFC5737], the use
   of designated code values reserved for documentation and examples
   reduces the likelihood of conflicts and confusion arising from their
   duplication of code points assigned for some deployed use.

   [RFC8126] is incorporated herein except where there are contrary
   provisions in this document.  In this document, "IESG Ratification"
   is used in some cases. IESG Ratification is specified in Section 5.1.
   It is not the same as "IESG Approval" in [RFC8126].



1.1 Notations Used in This Document

   This document uses hexadecimal notation.  Each octet (that is, 8-bit
   byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving the value of
   the octet as an unsigned integer.  Successive octets are separated by
   a hyphen.  This document consistently uses IETF bit ordering although
   the physical order of bit transmission within an octet on an IEEE
   [802.3] link is from the lowest order bit to the highest order bit
   (i.e., the reverse of the IETF's ordering).

   In this document:

   "AFN"    Address Family Number [RFC4760].

   "CFM"    Connectivity Fault Managment [RFC7319].

   "CID"    Company Identifier.

   "EUI"    Extended Unique Identifier.

   "IAB"    Individual Address Block, not Internet Architecture Board
            (iab.org).

   "IEEE"   Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers
            (www.ieee.org).

   "IEEE-SA" IEEE Standards Association (standards.ieee.org).

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   "MA-L"   MAC Address Block Large, commonly referred to as an OUI.

   "MA-M"   MAC Address Block Medium.

   "MA-S"   MAC Address Block Small.

   "MAC"    Media Access Control, not for Message Authentication Code.

   "MAC-48" A 48-bit MAC address. This term is obsolete. If globally
            unique, use EUI-48.

   "OUI"    Organizationally Unique Identifier. An OUI is now officially
            calle "MA-L" by the IEEE.

   "RRTYPE" A DNS Resource Record type [RFC6895].

   "SLAP"   IEEE 802 Structured Local Address Plan [802_O&A].

   "TLV"    Type, Length, Value.

   "**"     This symbol indicates exponentiation.  For example, 2**24 is
            two to the twenty-fourth power.



1.2 Changes from RFC 7042

   This document obsoletes [RFC7042] and makes the changes listed below.
   However, the completed application template based upon which an IANA
   OUI-based protocol number value was assigned for document use remains
   that in Appendix C of RFC 7042.

   o  Information on MA-M (28-bit) and MA-S (36-bit) EUI prefixes that
      the IEEE Registration Authority assignes.

   o  The restructuring of the "local" MAC address space into four
      quadrants under the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP [802_O&A].

   o  Mention of the IEEE 802 CFM Codepoints that have been allocated to
      the IETF (see Section 1.5).

   o  Minor details clarified in Section 5.1 on Expert Review and IESG
      Ratification.



1.3 The IEEE Registration Authority

   Originally the responsibility of Xerox Corporation, the registration
   authority for Ethernet parameters is now the IEEE Registration


D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                          [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   Authority, available on the web at:

      http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/

   The IEEE Registration Authority operates under the direction of the
   IEEE-SA Board of Governors. Anyone may apply to that Authority for
   parameter assignments.  The IEEE Registration Authority may impose
   fees or other requirements but commonly waives fees for applications
   from standards development organizations.

   Lists of some assignments and their holders are downloadable from the
   IEEE Registration Authority site.



1.4 The IANA Organizationally Unique Identifier

   The Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) 00-00-5E has been
   assigned to IANA.

   There is no OUI value reserved at this time for documentation, but
   there are documentation code points under the IANA OUI specified
   below.



1.5 CFM Code Points

   The IEEE has allocated two blocks of 802 Connectivity Fault
   Management (CFM) code points to the IETF, one for CFM OpCodes and one
   for CFM TLV Types.  Further information, including IANA
   considerations for assignment of values from these block for IETF
   use, are given in [RFC7319].  This document does not further discuss
   these blocks of codepoints.

2. Ethernet Identifier Parameters

   Section 2.1 discusses 48-bit MAC identifiers, their relationship to
   OUIs and other prefixes, and assignment under the IANA OUI.  Section
   2.2 extends this to 64-bit identifiers.  Section 2.3 discusses other
   IETF MAC identifier use not under the IANA OUI. ([RAC_OUI] indicates
   that the IEEE Registration Authority Committee was at one time
   exploring the feasibility of defining 128-bit identifiers.  [RAC_OUI]
   is an expired draft that also provides additional historic
   information on [IEEE802] registries.)



2.1 48-Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and Other Prefixes

   48-bit MAC "addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet interface
   identifiers.  Those that are globally unique are also called EUI-48
   identifiers (Extended Unique Identifier 48).  An EUI-48 is structured
   into an initial prefix assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority
   and additional bits assigned by the prefix owner.  Currently there
   are three lengths of prefixes assigned as shown in the table below;
   however, some prefix bits have special meaning as shown in Figure 1.

      Prefix Length                  Owner Supplied Bits
        in bits       Name              for EUI-48
      -------------  ------         --------------------
          24          OUI (MAC-L)       24
          28          MAC-M             20
          36          MAC-S             12

   Actually, the bottom four bits, as shown below, of the first octet of
   the 3-octet 48-bit MAC have speical meaning and are referred to below
   as the M, X, Y, and Z bits.

                    Figure 1. 48-bit MAC Address Structure


   A 3-octet OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) is followed by an
   additional 3 octets assigned by the OUI holder or into a larger
   initial prefix assigned to an organization and a shorter sequence of
   additional bits so as to add up to 48 bits in total.  For example,

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   the IEEE has assigned IABs (Individual Address Blocks), where the
   first 4 1/2 octets (36 bits) are assigned, giving the holder of the
   IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits) they can control; however, IABs have
   become historic, and a wider range of prefix lengths will be made
   available [RAC_OUI].

   The IEEE describes its assignment procedures and policies for IEEE
   802-related identifiers in [802_O&A]. An IEEE tutorial on EUIs, OUIs,
   and CIDs is available at [IEEE tutorial].



2.1.1 Special First Octet Bits

   Four bits within the initial octet of an IEEE MAC interface
   identifier, such as an EUI-48, have special significance [802_O&A] as
   follows:

    M bit --- This bit always indicates a group address and is
              frequently referred to as the group bit.  If it is zero,
              the MAC address is unicast. If it is a one, the address is
              multicast or broadcast. This meaning is independent of the
              values of the X, Y, and Z bits.

    X bit --- This bit was previously called the "local" bit. If it is
              zero, the MAC address is a global address under the
              control of the owner of the IEEE assigned prefix.
              Previously, if it was a one, the MAC address was
              considered "local" and under the assignment and control of
              the local network operator (but see Section 2.3). Now, if
              it is a one, the nature of the MAC address is optionally
              determined by the Y and Z bits under the IEEE 802
              Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP) as described below.

    Y&Z bits - These two bits have no special meaning if the X bit is
              zero. If the X bit is one, these tow bits divide the
              formerly uniform "local" MAC address space into four
              quadrants, as follows. These quadrants are further
              described below.

                 Y bit  Z bit    Quadrant -----  -----   -----------
                   0      0      Administratively Assigned
                   0      1      Extended Local
                   1      0      Reserved
                   1      1      Standard Assigned

   While a local network administrator can assign any addresses with the
   X bit a one, the optional SLAP characterizes four quadrants of the
   "local" address space using the Y and Z bits as follows:



D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                          [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


     Administratively Assigned - MAC addresses in this quadrant are
               called Administratively Assigned Identifiers. This is
               intended for arbitrary local assignment such as random
               assignment; however, see Section 2.3.1.

     Extended Local  - MAC addresses in this quadrant are called
               Extended Local Identifiers. These addresses are not
               actually "local" under SLAP. They are available to the
               organization that has been assigned the CID (see Section
               xxx) specifying the other 20 bits of the 24 bit prefix
               with X, Y, Z bits 1, 0, 1 respectively.

     Reserved - MAC addresses in this quadrant are reserved for future
               use under the SLAP. Until such future use, they could be
               locally assigned as Administratively Assigned Identifiers
               are assigned but there is a danger that such future SLAP
               use would cause a conflict.

     Standard Assigned - MAC addresses in this quadrant are known as
               Standard Assigned Identifiers. It is intended that such
               addresses be assigned and possibly revoked through a
               local protocol. There is on-going work in the IEEE
               [802.1CQ] and the IETF [DHCPmac] [SLAPquad] to develop
               such protocols.



2.1.2 OUIs and CIDs

   OUI, MAC-M, and MAC-S MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit
   zero and the Group bit unspecified.  Multicast identifiers may be
   constructed by turning on the Group bit, and unicast identifiers may
   be constructed by leaving the Group bit zero.

   The Local bit is zero for globally unique EUI-48 identifiers assigned
   by the owner of an OUI or owner of a longer prefix.  If the Local bit
   is a one, the identifier has been considered by IEEE 802 to be a
   local identifier under the control of the local network
   administrator; however, there may be emerging recommendations from
   the IEEE Registration Authority on management of the local address
   space.  If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI has no special
   authority over MAC identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to
   their OUI.

   An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have been assigned for 48-bit MAC addresses
   (see Section 5.2).

2.1.3 EUI-48 Assignments under the IANA OUI

   The OUI 00-00-5E has been assigned to IANA as stated in Section 1.4
   above.  This includes 2**24 EUI-48 multicast identifiers from
   01-00-5E-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-FF-FF-FF and 2**24 EUI-48 unicast
   identifiers from 00-00-5E-00-00-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FF-FF.

   Of these EUI-48 identifiers, the sub-blocks reserved or thus far
   assigned by IANA for purposes of documentation are as follows:

   Unicast, all blocks of 2**8 addresses thus far:

      00-00-5E-00-00-00 through 00-00-5E-00-00-FF: reserved and require
         IESG Ratification for assignment (see Section 5.1).

      00-00-5E-00-01-00 through 00-00-5E-00-01-FF: assigned for the
         Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798].

      00-00-5E-00-02-00 through 00-00-5E-00-02-FF: assigned for the IPv6
         Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (IPv6 VRRP) [RFC5798].

      00-00-5E-00-52-00 through 00-00-5E-00-52-FF: used for very small
         assignments.  Currently, 3 out of these 256 values have been
         assigned.

      00-00-5E-00-53-00 through 00-00-5E-00-53-FF: assigned for use in
         documentation.

   Multicast:

      01-00-5E-00-00-00 through 01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF: 2**23 addresses
         assigned for IPv4 multicast [RFC1112].

      01-00-5E-80-00-00 through 01-00-5E-8F-FF-FF: 2**20 addresses
         assigned for MPLS multicast [RFC5332].

      01-00-5E-90-00-00 through 01-00-5E-90-00-FF: 2**8 addresses being
         used for very small assignments.  Currently, 4 out of these 256
         values have been assigned.

      01-00-5E-90-10-00 through 01-00-5E-90-10-FF: 2**8 addresses for
         use in documentation.

   For more detailed and up-to-date information, see the "Ethernet
   Numbers" registry at http://www.iana.org.

2.1.4 EUI-48 Documentation Values

   The following values have been assigned for use in documentation:

      00-00-5E-00-53-00 through 00-00-5E-00-53-FF for unicast and

      01-00-5E-90-10-00 through 01-00-5E-90-10-FF for multicast.



2.1.5 EUI-48 IANA Assignment Considerations

   EUI-48 assignments under the current or a future IANA OUI (see
   Section 5.4) must meet the following requirements:

      o  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or
         other standard related to IETF work),

      o  must be for a power-of-two size block of identifiers starting
         at a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two,
         including the assignment of one (2**0) identifier,

      o  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain
         their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and

      o  must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.

   In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure
   in Section 5.1):

      Small to medium assignments of a block of 1, 2, 4, ..., 32768,
         65536 (2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**15, 2**16) EUI-48 identifiers
         require Expert Review (see Section 5.1).

      Large assignments of 131072 (2**17) or more EUI-48 identifiers
         require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).



2.2 64-Bit MAC Identifiers

   IEEE also defines a system of 64-bit MAC identifiers including
   EUI-64s.  EUI-64 identifiers are currently used as follows:

      o  In a modified form to construct some IPv6 interface identifiers
         as described in Section 2.2.1

      o  In IEEE Std 1394 (also known as FireWire and i.Link)

      o  In IEEE Std 802.15.4 (also known as ZigBee)


D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                         [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


      o  In [InfiniBand]

   Adding a 5-octet (40-bit) extension to a 3-octet (24-bit) OUI, or a
   shorter extension to longer assigned prefixes [RAC_OUI] so as to
   total 64 bits, produces an EUI-64 identifier under that OUI or longer
   prefix.  As with EUI-48 identifiers, the first octet has the same
   Group and Local bits.

   An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have been assigned for 64-bit MAC addresses
   (see Section 5.2).

   The discussion below is almost entirely in terms of the "Modified"
   form of EUI-64 identifiers; however, anyone assigned such an
   identifier can also use the unmodified form as a MAC identifier on
   any link that uses such 64-bit identifiers for interfaces.



2.2.1. IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers

   MAC-64 identifiers are used to form the lower 64 bits of some IPv6
   addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A of [RFC4291] and Appendix A
   of [RFC5214]).  When so used, the MAC-64 is modified by inverting the
   Local/Global bit to form an IETF "Modified EUI-64 identifier".  Below
   is an illustration of a Modified EUI-64 unicast identifier under the
   IANA OUI, where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee is the extension.

      02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee

   The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified
   EUI-64 identifiers, the sense of the Local/Global bit is inverted
   compared with EUI-48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values
   (universal scope) that have the 02 bit on in the first octet, while
   those with this bit off are locally assigned and out of scope for
   global assignment.

   The Local/Global bit was inverted to make it easier for network
   operators to type in local-scope identifiers.  Thus, such Modified
   EUI-64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc. (ignoring leading zeros) are local.
   Without the modification, they would have to be
   02-00-00-00-00-00-00-01, 02-00-00-00-00-00-00-02, etc. to be local.

   As with 48-bit MAC identifiers, the 01 bit on in the first octet
   indicates a group identifier.

   When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified EUI-64
   identifier are FF-FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24-bit
   value as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI-48.  For example:

      02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy


D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                         [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   or
      03-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy

   where yy-yy-yy is the portion (of an EUI-48 global unicast or
   multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this
   case).  Thus, any holder of one or more EUI-48 identifiers under the
   IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI-64 identifiers that
   can be formed by inserting FF-FE in the middle of their EUI-48
   identifiers and inverting the Local/Global bit.

      (Note: [EUI-64] defines FF-FF as the bits to be inserted to create
      an IEEE EUI-64 identifier from a EUI-48 identifier.  That document
      says the FF-FE value is used when starting with an EUI-48
      identifier.  The IETF uses only FF-FE to create Modified EUI-64
      identifiers from 48-bit Ethernet station identifiers regardless of
      whether they are EUI-48 or 48-bit local MAC identifiers.  EUI-48
      and local 48-bit MAC identifiers are syntactically equivalent, and
      this doesn't cause any problems in practice.)

   In addition, certain Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the IANA OUI
   are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows:

      02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx

   where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit IPv4 address.  The owner of an IPv4
   address has both the unicast- and multicast-derived EUI-64 address.
   Modified EUI-64 identifiers from

      02-00-5E-FE-F0-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF

   are effectively reserved pending the specification of IPv4 Class E
   addresses.  However, for Modified EUI-64 identifiers based on an IPv4
   address, the Local/Global bit should be set to correspond to whether
   the IPv4 address is local or global.  (Keep in mind that the sense of
   the Modified EUI-64 identifier Local/Global bit is reversed from that
   in (unmodified) MAC-64 identifiers.)



2.2.2 EUI-64 IANA Assignment Considerations

   The following table shows which Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the
   IANA OUI are reserved, assigned, or available as indicated.  As noted
   above, the corresponding MAC addresses can be determined by
   complementing the 02 bit in the first octet.  In all cases, the
   corresponding multicast 64-bit MAC addresses formed by complementing
   the 01 bit in the first octet have the same status as the modified
   64-bit unicast address blocks listed below.

      02-00-5E-00-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-0F-FF-FF-FF-FF reserved


D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                         [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


      02-00-5E-10-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-10-00-00-00-FF assigned for
         documentation use

      02-00-5E-10-00-00-01-00 to 02-00-5E-EF-FF-FF-FF-FF available for
         assignment

      02-00-5E-F0-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FD-FF-FF-FF-FF reserved

      02-00-5E-FE-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF assigned to
         IPv4 address holders as described above

      02-00-5E-FF-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FF-FD-FF-FF-FF reserved

      02-00-5E-FF-FE-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FF-FE-FF-FF-FF assigned for
         holders of EUI-48 identifiers under the IANA OUI as described
         above

      02-00-5E-FF-FF-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF reserved

   The reserved identifiers above require IESG Ratification (see Section
   5.1) for assignment.  IANA EUI-64 identifier assignments under the
   IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:

      o  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or
         other standard related to IETF work),

      o  must be for a power-of-two size block of identifiers starting
         at a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two,
         including the assignment of one (2**0) identifier,

      o  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain
         their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and

      o  must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.

   In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure
   in Section 5.1):

      Small to medium assignments of a block of 1, 2, 4, ..., 134217728,
         268435456 (2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**27, 2**28) EUI-64
         identifiers require Expert Review (see Section 5.1).

      Assignments of any size, including 536870912 (2**29) or more
         EUI-64 identifiers, may be made with IESG Ratification (see
         Section 5.1).

2.2.3 EUI-64 Documentation Values

   The following blocks of unmodified 64-bit MAC addresses are for
   documentation use.  The IPv4-derived addresses are based on the IPv4
   documentation addresses [RFC5737], and the MAC-derived addresses are
   based on the EUI-48 documentation addresses above.

   Unicast Values for Documentation Use:

      00-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-00 to 00-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-FF general

      00-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-00 to 00-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-FF and
      00-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-00 to 00-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-FF and
      00-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-00 to 00-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-FF IPv4 derived

      00-00-5E-FF-FE-00-53-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FE-00-53-FF EUI-48 derived

      00-00-5E-FE-EA-C6-33-64 and
      00-00-5E-FE-EA-CB-00-71 IPv4 multicast derived from IPv4 unicast
         [RFC6034]

   Multicast Values for Documentation Use:

      01-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-FF general

      01-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-00 to 01-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-FF and
      01-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-00 to 01-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-FF and
      01-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-00 to 01-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-FF IPv4 derived

      01-00-5E-FF-FE-90-10-00 to 01-00-5E-FF-FE-90-10-FF EUI-48 derived



2.3 Other 48-bit MAC Identifiers Used by the IETF

   There are two other blocks of 48-bit MAC identifiers that are used by
   the IETF as described below.



2.3.1 Identifiers Prefixed '33-33'

   All 48-bit multicast MAC identifiers prefixed "33-33" (that is, the
   2**32 multicast MAC identifiers in the range from 33-33-00-00-00-00


D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                         [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   to 33-33-FF-FF-FF-FF) are used as specified in [RFC2464] for IPv6
   multicast.  In all of these identifiers, the Group bit (the bottom
   bit of the first octet) is on, as is required to work properly with
   existing hardware as a multicast identifier.  They also have the
   Local bit on but any ethernet using standard IPv6 multicast should
   note that these addresses will be used for that purpose.

      (Historical note: It was the custom during IPv6 design to use "3"
      for unknown or example values and 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo
      Alto, California, is the address of PARC (Palo Alto Research
      Center, formerly "Xerox PARC").  Ethernet was originally specified
      by the Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Xerox
      Corporation.  The pre-IEEE [802.3] Ethernet protocol has sometimes
      been known as "DIX" Ethernet from the first letters of the names
      of these companies.)



2.3.2 The 'CF Series'

   The Informational [RFC2153] declared the 3-octet values from CF-00-00
   through CF-FF-FF to be OUIs available for assignment by IANA to
   software vendors for use in PPP [RFC1661] or for other uses where
   vendors do not otherwise need an IEEE-assigned OUI.  It should be
   noted that, when used as 48-bit MAC prefixes, these values have all
   of the Z, Y, X (Local), and M (Group) special bits at the bottom of
   the first byte equal to one, while all IEEE-assigned OUIs thus far
   have the X and M bits zero.  The Group bit is meaningless in PPP.  To
   quote [RFC2153]: "The 'CF0000' series was arbitrarily chosen to match
   the PPP NLPID 'CF', as a matter of mnemonic convenience." (For
   further information on NLPIDs, see [RFC6328].)

      CF-00-00 is reserved, and IANA lists multicast identifier
      CF-00-00-00-00-00 as used for Ethernet loopback tests.

   In over a decade of availability, only a handful of values in the CF
   Series have been assigned.  (See "Ethernet Numbers"
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers> and "PPP Numbers"
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp-numbers>).



2.3.2.1 Changes to RFC 2153

   The IANA Considerations in [RFC2153] were updated as follows by the
   approval of RFC 5342 (no technical changes have been made):

      o  Use of these identifiers based on IANA assignment was
         deprecated.

      o  IANA was instructed not to assign any further values in the 'CF
         Series'.

3. Ethernet Protocol Parameters

   Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means of indicating the
   contents of a frame -- for example, that its contents are IPv4 or
   IPv6.

   The concept has been extended to labeling by "tags".  A tag in this
   sense is a prefix whose type is identified by an Ethertype that is
   then followed by either another tag, an Ethertype, or an LSAP (Link-
   Layer Service Access Point) protocol indicator for the "main" body of
   the frame, as described below.  Traditionally, in the [802_O&A]
   world, tags are a fixed length and do not include any encoding of
   their own length.  Any device that is processing a frame cannot, in
   general, safely process anything in the frame past an Ethertype it
   does not understand.  An example is the C-Tag (formerly the Q-Tag)
   [802.1Q].  It provides customer VLAN and priority information for a
   frame.

   There are two types of protocol identifier parameters that can occur
   in Ethernet frames after the initial MAC-48 destination and source
   identifiers:

      Ethertypes: These are 16-bit identifiers appearing as the initial
         two octets after the MAC destination and source (or after a
         tag), which, when considered as an unsigned integer, are equal
         to or larger than 0x0600.

      LSAPs: These are 8-bit protocol identifiers that occur in pairs
         immediately after an initial 16-bit (two-octet) remaining frame
         length, which is in turn after the MAC destination and source
         (or after a tag).  Such a length must, when considered as an
         unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DC, or it could be mistaken
         as an Ethertype.  LSAPs occur in pairs where one is intended to
         indicate the source protocol handler and one the destination
         protocol handler; however, use cases where the two are
         different have been relatively rare.

   Neither Ethertypes nor LSAPs are assigned by IANA; they are assigned
   by the IEEE Registration Authority (see Section 1.3 above and
   Appendix B).  However, both LSAPs and Ethertypes have extension
   mechanisms so that they can be used with five-octet Ethernet protocol
   identifiers under an OUI, including those assigned by IANA under the
   IANA OUI.

   When using the IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (LLC) format (Subnetwork
   Access Protocol (SNAP)) [802_O&A] for a frame, an OUI-based protocol
   identifier can be expressed as follows:

      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz



D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                         [Page 17]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   where xx-xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough
   not to be confused with an Ethertype; "AA" is the LSAP that indicates
   this use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP Service Access
   Point (SAP); "03" is the LLC control octet indicating datagram
   service; yy-yy-yy is an OUI; and zz-zz is a protocol number, under
   that OUI, assigned by the OUI owner.  The five-octet length for such
   OUI-based protocol identifiers was chosen so that, with the LLC
   control octet ("03"), the result is 16-bit aligned.

   When using an Ethertype to indicate the main type for a frame body,
   the special "OUI Extended Ethertype" 88-B7 is available.  Using this
   Ethertype, a frame body can begin with

      88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   where yy-yy-yy and zz-zz have the same meaning as in the SNAP format
   described above.

   It is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary
   Ethertype.  Putting the Ethertype as the zz-zz field after an all-
   zeros OUI (00-00-00) does this.  It looks like

      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-zz-zz

   where zz-zz is the Ethertype.

      (Note that, at this point, the 802 protocol syntax facilities are
      sufficiently powerful that they could be chained indefinitely.
      Whether support for such chaining is generally required is not
      clear, but [802_O&A] requires support for

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

      although this could be more efficiently expressed by simply
      pinching out the "00-00-00-88-B7" in the middle.)

   As well as labeling frame contents, 802 protocol types appear within
   NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) Next Hop Resolution Protocol
   [RFC2332] messages.  Such messages have provisions for both two-octet
   Ethertypes and OUI-based protocol types. 16-bit Ethertypes also occur
   in the Generic Router Encapsulation (GRE [RFC2784]) header.




3.1 Ethernet Protocol Assignment under the IANA OUI

   Two-octet protocol numbers under the IANA OUI are available, as in

      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-5E-qq-qq


D. Eastlake & J. Abley                                         [Page 18]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   where qq-qq is the protocol number.

   A number of such assignments have been made out of the 2**16 protocol
   numbers available from 00-00-5E-00-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FF (see [IANA]).
   The extreme values of this range, 00-00-5E-00-00 and 00-00-5E-FF-FF,
   are reserved and require IESG Ratification for assignment (see
   Section 5.1).  New assignments of SNAP SAP protocol (qq-qq) numbers
   under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:

      o  the assignment must be for standards use (either for an IETF
         Standard or other standard related to IETF work),

      o  it must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC, and

      o  such protocol numbers are not to be assigned for any protocol
         that has an Ethertype (because that can be expressed by putting
         an all-zeros "OUI" before the Ethertype as described above).

   In addition, the Expert Review (or IESG Ratification for the two
   reserved values) must be obtained using the procedure specified in
   Section 5.1.



3.2 Documentation Protocol Number

   0x0042 is a protocol number under the IANA OUI (that is,
   00-00-5E-00-42) to be used as an example for documentation purposes.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


4.  Other OUI-Based Parameters

   Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide for parameters based on an
   OUI beyond those discussed above.  Such parameters most commonly
   consist of an OUI plus one octet of additional value.  They are
   usually called "vendor specific" parameters, although "organization
   specific" might be more accurate.  They would look like

      yy-yy-yy-zz

   where yy-yy-yy is the OUI and zz is the additional specifier.  An
   example is the Cipher Suite Selector in IEEE [802.11].

   Values may be assigned under the IANA OUI for such other OUI-based
   parameter usage by Expert Review except that, for each use, the
   additional specifier values consisting of all zero bits and all one
   bits (0x00 (00-00-5E-00) and 0xFF (00-00-5E-FF) for a one-octet
   specifier) are reserved and require IESG Ratification (see Section
   5.1) for assignment; also, the additional specifier value 0x42
   (00-00-5E-42) is assigned for use as an example in documentation.

   Assignments of such other IANA OUI-based parameters must be for
   standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related
   to IETF work) and be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.  The
   first time a value is assigned for a particular parameter of this
   type, an IANA registry will be created to contain that assignment and
   any subsequent assignments of values for that parameter under the
   IANA OUI.  The Expert will specify the name of the registry.

   If different policies from those above are required for such a
   parameter, a BCP or Standards Track RFC must be adopted to update
   this BCP and specify the new policy and parameter.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document concerns IANA considerations for the assignment of
   Ethernet parameters in connection with the IANA OUI and related
   matters.

   As this document replaces [RFC7042], references to [RFC7042] in IANA
   registries will be replaced by references to this document.

   This document does not create any new IANA registries.

   The MAC address values assigned for documentation and the protocol
   number for documentation were both assigned by [RFC7042].

   No existing assignment is changed by this document.



5.1 Expert Review and IESG Ratification

   This section specifies the procedure for Expert Review and IESG
   Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA OUI-based identifiers.
   The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall consist of one or
   more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the IESG.

   The procedure described for Expert Review assignments in this
   document is fully consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy
   described in [RFC8126].

   While finite, the universe of code points from which Expert-judged
   assignments will be made is felt to be large enough that the
   requirements given in this document and the Experts' good judgment
   are sufficient guidance.  The idea is for the Expert to provide a
   light sanity check for small assignments of EUI identifiers, with
   increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium-sized assignments of EUI
   identifiers and assignments of protocol identifiers and other IANA
   OUI-based parameters.  However, it can make sense to assign very
   large portions of the MAC identifier code point space.  (Note that
   existing assignments include one for 1/2 of the entire multicast IANA
   EUI-48 code point space and one for 1/16 of that multicast code point
   space.)  In those cases, and in cases of the assignment of "reserved"
   values, IESG Ratification of an Expert Review approval recommendation
   is required as described below.  The procedure is as follows:

      The applicant always completes the appropriate template from
         Appendix A below and sends it to IANA <iana@iana.org>.

      IANA always sends the template to an appointed Expert.  If the
         Expert recuses themselves or is non-responsive, IANA may choose
         an alternative appointed Expert or, if none is available, will

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


         contact the IESG.

      In all cases, if IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert
         selected to review an application template, the application
         will be denied. The Expert should provide a reason for refusal
         which IANA will communicate back to the applicant.

      If the assignment is based on Expert Review:

            If IANA receives approval and code points are available,
            IANA will make the requested assignment.

      If the assignment is based on IESG Ratification:

            The procedure starts with the first steps above for Expert
            Review.  If the Expert disapproves the application, they
            simply inform IANA; however, if the Expert believes the
            application should be approved, or is uncertain and believes
            that the circumstances warrant the attention of the IESG,
            the Expert will inform IANA about their advice, and IANA
            will forward the application, together with the reasons
            provided by the Expert for approval or uncertainty, to the
            IESG.  The IESG must decide whether the assignment will be
            granted.  This can be accomplished by a management item in
            an IESG telechat as is done for other types of requests.  If
            the IESG decides not to ratify a favorable opinion by the
            Expert or decides against an application where the Expert is
            uncertain, the application is denied; otherwise, it is
            granted.  The IESG will communicate its decision to the
            Expert and to IANA. In case of refusal, the IESG should
            provide a reason which IANA will communicate to the
            applicant.



5.2 MAC Address AFNs and RRTYPEs

   IANA has assigned Address Family Numbers (AFNs) for MAC addresses as
   follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


            AFN         Decimal     Hex      Reference
         ----------     -------    ------    ---------
         48-bit MAC      16389     0x4005    [RFC7042]
         64-bit MAC      16390     0x4006    [RFC7042]
         24-bit OUI      16391     0x4007    [RFC7961]

         MAC/24          16392     0x4008    [RFC7961]
           Lower 24 bits of a 48-bit MAC address

         MAC/40          16393     0x4009    [RFC7961]
           Lower 40 bits of a 64-bit MAC address

   IANA has assigned DNS RRTYPEs [RFC6895] for MAC addresses as follows:

                                   RRTYPE Code
            Data       Mnemonic   Decimal   Hex      Reference
         ----------    --------   -------  ------   -----------
         48-bit MAC     EUI48       108    0x006C   [RFC7043]
         64-bit MAC     EUI64       109    0x006D   [RFC7043]



5.3 Informational IANA Web Page Material

   IANA maintains an informational listing on its web site concerning
   Ethertypes, OUIs, and multicast addresses assigned under OUIs other
   than the IANA OUI.  The title of this informational registry is "IEEE
   802 Numbers".  IANA has merged in those Ethertypes listed in Appendix
   B that were not already included.  IANA will update that
   informational registry when changes are provided by the Expert(s).



5.4 OUI Exhaustion

   When the available space for either multicast or unicast EUI-48
   identifiers under OUI 00-00-5E has been 90% or more exhausted, IANA
   should request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority
   for further IANA assignment.  The appointed Expert(s) should monitor
   for this condition and notify IANA.



5.5 IANA OUI MAC Address Table

   No changes have been made in the "IANA Unicast 48-bit MAC Addresses"
   and "IANA Multicast 48-bit MAC Addresses" tables except for the
   updates to references as specified in the first part of Section 5.

5.6 SNAP Protocol Number Table and Assignment

   The IANA table formerly called the "SNAP PROTOCOL IDs" table has been
   renamed "SNAP Protocol Numbers".  "PID" has been replaced by
   "Protocol Number".

   IANA has assigned 0x0042 as the SNAP protocol number under the IANA
   OUI to be used for documentation purposes.

6. Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with assignment of parameters under the
   IANA OUI and closely related matters.  It is not directly concerned
   with security except as follows.

   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of MAC addresses or
   other OUI-derived protocol parameters as examples in documentation.
   Examples that are "only" to be used in documentation can end up being
   coded and released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the
   possible acquisition of intellectual property rights in such
   addresses or parameters.  The reservation herein of MAC addresses and
   parameters for documentation purposes will minimize such confusion
   and conflict.

   See [RFC7043] for security considerations in storing MAC addresses in
   the DNS.
