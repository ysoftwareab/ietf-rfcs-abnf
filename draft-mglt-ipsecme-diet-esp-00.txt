        Diet-ESP: a flexible and compressed format for IPsec/ESP
                   draft-mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp-00.txt

Abstract

   IPsec/ESP has been designed to secure IP packets exchanged between
   two nodes.  IPsec implements security at the IP layer which makes
   security transparent to the applications, as opposed to TLS or DTLS
   that requires application to implement TLS/DTLS.  As a result, IPsec
   enable to define the security rules in a similar way one establishes
   firewall rules.

   One of the IPsec's drawbacks is that implementing security on a per
   packet basis adds overhead to each IP packet.  Considering IoT
   devices, the data transmitted over an IP packet is expected to be
   rather small, and the cost of sending extra bytes is so high that
   IPsec/ESP can hardly be used for IoT as it is currently defined in
   RFC 4303.

   This document defines Diet-ESP, a protocol that compress and reduce
   the ESP overhead of IPsec/ESP so that it can fit security and energy
   efficient IoT requirements.  Diet-ESP use already existing mechanism
   like IKEv2 to negotiate the compression format.  Furthermore a lot of
   information, already existing for an IPsec Security Association, are
   reused to offer light negotiation in addition to maximum compression.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   The IPsec/ESP [RFC4303] is represented in Figure Figure 1 . It was
   designed to: 1) provide high level of security as a basis, 2) favor
   interoperability between implementations 3) scale on large
   infrastructures.

   In order to match these goals, ESP format favor mandatory fields with
   fixed sizes that are designed for the worst case scenarios.  This
   results in a kind of "unique" packet format common to all considered
   scenarios using ESP.  These specific scenarios MAY result in carrying
   "unnecessary" or "larger then required" fields.  This cost of
   additional bytes were than considered as negligible versus
   interoperability, and this made ESP very successful over the years.

   With IoT, requirements become slightly different.  For most devices,
   like sensors, sending extra bytes directly impacts the battery and so
   the life time of the sensor.  Furthermore, IoT scenarios MAY consider
   that sensors MAY be designed not to interconnect between each other,
   but instead to be connected to a specific Security Gateway.  These
   kind of dedicated connectivity, for example, does not impose the
   sensors to be fully interoperable with any other IPsec/ESP
   implementation.  In contrast, it MAY be inter-operable with the
   Security Gateway and those devices supporting the same sensor's
   options.

   In this document, we adapted ESP so IoT devices can use ESP designed
   for their specific needs or applications.  Diet-ESP allows to reduce
   or remove all fields of the ESP format represented in figure 1.  How
   the fields are reduced is defined in the Diet-ESP Context.  This
   Diet-ESP Context MAY be announced or negotiated between the two
   peers.  How the two devices agree on using the same Diet-ESP Context
   is out of scope of this document.  Diet-ESP Context consist of a byte
   that fully defines the parameters present in a Diet-ESP packet,
   creating a Diet-ESP packet format agreement between compliant
   devices.

4.  Diet-ESP: Protocol Description

   This section describes how each field of the ESP can be compressed.

   SPI SIZE: ESP Security Policy Index is 32 bits long.  Diet-ESP omits,
   leaves unchanged, or reduces the SPI to 8, 16 or 24 bits.  The length
   of the SPI should be guided by 1) the number of simultaneous inbound
   SA the device is expected to handle and 2) reliability of the IP
   addresses in order to identify the proper SA for incoming packets.
   More specifically, a sensor with a single connection to a Security
   Gateway, may bind incoming packets to the proper SA based only in its
   IP addresses.  In that case, the SPI MAY not be necessary.  Other
   scenarios may consider using the SPI to index the SAs or may consider
   having multiple ESP channels with the same host from a single host.
   In that case it may choose a reduced length for the SPI.  Note that
   reducing the size of the SPI may expose the system to security flows.
   See Section 8 for more details.  Note also that the value 0 for the
   SPI is note allowed to be sent on the wire as described in [RFC4303].

   For those cases where a regular SPI of 32 bits has been negotiated
   (e.g. via IKEv2 [RFC5996]), the resulting SPI used for Diet-ESP
   packets corresponds to the high order bits of that 32 bits SPI (see
   Section 6 for further explanations).

   SN SIZE: ESP Sequence Number is 32 bit and extended SN is 64 bit
   long.  Diet-ESP omits, leaves unchanged or reduces SN to 8, 16, 24

   bits.  The length of the SN should be guided by 1) how the receiving
   side handles the SN, 2) the number of packets expected to be sent
   over Diet-ESP channel, and 3) how the node is willing to use IKEv2 to
   re-key when SN are expired.  SN are used to address replay attacks,
   thus removing SN may expose the system to security flaws.  See
   Section 8 for more details.  If SN is used, a 32 bits value may not
   be required.  Table 1 shows the lifetime of one SA before re-keying
   is required in case the SN expires.

   |    SN    |   1 packet per   |    1 packet per   |   1 packet per  |

   +----------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------+

   Table 1: Lifetime of one Security Association with different sizes of
             Sequence Numbers compared to different use cases.

   Note that SN and SPI MUST be aligned to a multiple of the Alignment
   value (ALIGN).

   NH: Diet-ESP is able to remove the Next Header field from the ESP-
   Trailer if the underlying protocol can be derived from the Traffic
   Selector (TS) within the SA.  More specifically, the next header
   indicates whether the encrypted ESP payload is an IP packet, a UDP
   packet, a TCP packet or no next header.  The NH can only be removed
   if this has been explicitly specified in the SA or if the device has
   a single application.  Suppose a device sets an ESP channel with
   another peer only considering the IP addresses as TS without
   specifying the transport protocols or (or upper layer protocols).  If
   the device uses this channel for multiple upper layer protocols (like
   HTTP and tnftp), then the NH cannot be removed as the receiver would
   not be able to determine whether incoming packets are HTTP or tnftp.

   Note that removing the Next Header impacts how encryption is
   performed.  For example, the use of AES-CBC [RFC3602] mode requires
   the last block to be padded to reach a 128 bit alignment.  In this
   case removing the Next Header increases the padding by the Next
   Header length, which is 8 bits.  In this case, removing the Next
   Header provides few advantages, as it does not reduce the ESP packet
   length.  With AES-CBC, the only advantage of removing the Next Header
   would be for data with the last block of 15 bytes.  In that case, ESP
   pad with 15 modulo 16 bytes, set the 1 byte pad length field to 15



Migault (Ed), et al.    Expires September 4, 2014               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  Diet-ESP                      March 2014


   and add the one byte Next Header field.  This leads to 15 + 15 + 1 +
   1 bytes to be sent.  On the other hand, removing the Next Header
   would require only the concatenation of the pad length byte with a 0
   value, which leads to 16 bytes to be sent.

   Other modes like AES-CTR [RFC3686] do not have block alignment
   requirements.  Using AES-CTR with ESP only requires the 32 bit
   alignment - mostly for OS implementation.  In fact if an n byte
   alignment is required (for encryption or for packet format), data of
   length k * n + n - 1 bytes, k an integer, takes advantage of removing
   the Next Header and reduces the data to be sent over n bytes.  In the
   case of sensor network it is very likely that data of fixed size k *
   n + n - 1 will be used.  Furthermore, if 32 bits alignment is reduced
   to 8 bits alignment, Next Header is always an additional unnecessary
   byte being sent.

   PAD: With ESP, all packets have a Pad Length field.  This field is
   usually present because ESP requires a 32 bits alignment which is
   performed with padding.  Diet-ESP considers that some devices may use
   8 bits alignment, in which case padding is not necessary.  Similarly,
   sensors may send application data that has fixed length matching the
   alignment.  Note that alignment may be required by the device (8-bit,
   16-bit, or more generally 32-bit), but it may also be required by the
   encryption block size (AES-CBC uses 128 bit blocks).  With ESP these
   scenarios would result in an unnecessary Pad Length field always set
   to zero.  Diet-ESP considers those case with no padding, and thus the
   Pad Length field can be omitted.

   ALIGN: Alignment for Padding and Pad Length.  ESP is designed for 32
   bit alignment.  This is mostly an OS implementation and hardware
   design requirements for regular PC processors.  IoT may not have
   these requirements.  Having no alignment requirements or a 16 bits
   alignment requirement prevents or reduces the number of padding bytes
   to be sent.  As a result Diet-ESP considers alternative alignment
   (8-bit, 16 bit, 32 bit) so to reduce the number of padding bytes.

   Note that when PAD requires the Pad Length field to be present, ALIGN
   provides the minimum alignment padding considers.  More specifically,
   ALIGN gives more priority to the hardware or OS implementation than
   to the encryption algorithm used.  In fact with AES-CTR padding will
   be performed based on the value provided by ALIGN.  However, AES-CBC
   padding is performed on the AES block basis (128 bits).  This value
   overwrites the one provided by ALIGN.

   IH: With ESP using the tunnel mode, the inner IP Header is sent in
   every ESP Payload.  This extra bytes sent do not carry relevant
   information over sent packets.  As a result Diet-ESP indicates the IP

   header has been omitted, and MUST be rebuilt by the receiver.  These
   information are negotiated via IKE and are stored in the SA.

   TH: With ESP the transport header is transmitted in every packet.
   This layer may not provide relevant information, especially for UDP
   transport layer.  The port parameters may be negotiated via IKE and
   stored in the SA.  As a result Diet-ESP indicates that the transport
   protocol header (TH) has been removed from the encrypted ESP Payload.
   This option can only be used if the header can be restored or if it
   is unnecessary for the further packet procession.  Other protocols
   than UDP are considered out of scope of this document.  TCP, for
   example, includes information that are not as easy to restore, like
   options, controls or windows.  In order to use other transport layer
   protocols within specific configuration, additional information may
   be provided in the future.

   ICV: ESP negotiates Authentication protocols.  These protocols
   generate an ICV of a length defined by the authentication protocol
   negotiated for the SA.  These authentication protocols do not provide
   ways to perform weak authentication, as it only reduces the size of
   the ICV.  IoT is interested in weak authentication as it may sends a
   small amount of bytes, and the trade-of between battery life time and
   security may be worth.  As a result Diet-ESP indicates the number of
   bytes of the ICV.  Diet-ESP considers sending the whole ICV or the
   first 1 byte resp (2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32) bytes.  Note that Note that
   reducing the size of the SPI may expose the system to security flows.
   See Section 8 for more details.

         the Diet-ESP header in byte.  Values can be from 0 to 4.  A
         zero value means the SPI does not appear in the Diet-ESP
         packet.  The size depends on the use case, the connection
         should be used for.

         ESP trailer.  P unset to 0 indicates the Pad Length field is
         present and P set to 1 indicates the Pad Length is omitted.

   - ALIGN (2 bits):  specifies Padding, Padding Length as follows:

         - 00: indicates an 8 bit alignment.  The field Pad Length is
               omitted and the Diet-ESP packet never has Padding.

         - 01: indicates a 16 bit alignment.  The field Pad Length is
               always present.

   - TH (1 bit):  specifies if the transport layer field appears in the
         Diet-ESP Payload Data.  TH unset to 0 indicates the Transport
         header field is present and TH set to 1 indicates the transport
         header is omitted.  In this case, the transport protocol MUST
         be specified in the SA with its associated port.  If a non
         unique port or a non unique transport protocol is specified,
         this bit MUST be unset to 0.  Otherwise, the device will not be
         able to rebuilt the transport header.  This document only
         considers UDP.

   - IH (1 bit):  specifies if the inner IP address field appears in the
         Diet-ESP Payload Data.  This bit is only significant for the
         tunnel mode.  With IPsec transport mode, IH SHOULD be set to 0
         and ignored.  With tunnel mode IH unset to 0 indicates the
         inner IP header field is present and IH set to 1 indicates the
         inner IP header is omitted.

   - ICV (2 bits):  specifies the transmitted number of bytes to
         authenticate the Diet-ESP packet.  Note that ICV is optional so
         if one chose not to perform authentication, it SHOULD negotiate
         the authentication algorithm to NULL as defined in [RFC4835].
         The minimum length greater than 0 for ICV is 96 bits and can be
         generated with the following hash functions: HMAC-MD5-96
         [RFC2403], HMAC-SHA1-96 [RFC2404], AES-CMAC-96 [RFC4494], AES-
         XCBC-MAC-96 [RFC3566].  As a result ICV only specifies size
         lower than 96 bits.

         - 000:  ICV is left untouched as it is specified by the
               authentication algorithm.

6.  Difference between Diet-ESP and ESP

   This section details how to use Diet-ESP to send and receive
   messages.  The use of Diet-ESP is based on the IPsec architecture
   [RFC4301] and ESP [RFC4303].  We suppose the reader is familiar with
   these documents and list here the adaptation that MAY be involved by
   Diet-ESP.

6.1.  Packet Alignment

   In ESP each packet has a fixed alignment to 32 bits.  For Diet-ESP
   each device has an internal parameter that defines the minimal kernel
   alignment that is acceptable.  ALIGN SHOULD be a the maximum of the
   peer's minimal alignment.

   Diet-ESP Context with SPI SIZE + SN SIZE that is not a multiple of
   ALIGN MUST be rejected.

6.2.  SAD

6.2.1.  Storing SPI SIZE SPI in the SAD

   For devices using a single SPI SIZE value (e.g. sensors), the SA will
   be indexed with the SPI as described in ESP.  More specifically, SPI
   is used as the index in the SAD.  The only difference is that it has
   smaller size in the ESP header.  If the only supported SPI SIZE is



Migault (Ed), et al.    Expires September 4, 2014              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  Diet-ESP                      March 2014


   zero, the lookup has to be performed with the IP address.  Some
   implementations MAY use a specific SPI value in their SAD for
   unspecified SPIs.

   For devices that allow multiple SPI SIZE, like some IoT generic end
   points or IoT Security Gateways, SAD lookup has to deal with SPI of
   different sizes.  The SPI stored in the SAD MAY be converted from an
   SPI of any size to a standard 4 bytes SPI.  This means that for
   inbound packets a conversion from SPI SIZE byte SPI to 4 byte SPI is
   performed before the SAD lookup.

   The SPI of the SA may be negotiated using IKEv2 [RFC5996].  Regular
   IKEv2 implementation negotiate a 4 byte SPI.  In order to be able to
   use regular IKEv2 for Diet-ESP, the following convention is used.
   The SPI considered in Diet-ESP consists in the SPI SIZE low power
   bytes of 32 bit SPI negotiated with IKEv2.  Only this value should be
   considered in the SAD.  How the SPI SIZE SPI is represented in the
   SAD is another issue addressed above.

6.2.2.  Inbound Security Association Lookup

   For devices that are configured with a single SPI SIZE value can
   process inbound packet as defined in [RFC4301].  As such, no
   modifications is required by Diet-ESP.

   Detecting Inbound Security Association: Identifying the SA for
   incoming packets is a one of the main reasons the SPI is send in each
   packet on the wire.  For regular ESP (and AH) packets, the Security
   Association is detected as follows:

   1. Search the SAD for a match on {SPI, destination address, source
      address}. If an SAD entry matches, then process the inbound ESP
      packet with that matching SAD entry.  Otherwise, proceed to step
      2.

   2. Search the SAD for a match on {SPI, destination address}. If the
      SAD entry matches, then process the inbound ESP packet with that
      matching SAD entry.  Otherwise, proceed to step 3.

   3. Search the SAD for a match on only {SPI} if the receiver has
      chosen to maintain a single SPI space for AH and ESP, or on {SPI,
      protocol} otherwise.  If an SAD entry matches, then process the
      inbound ESP packet with that matching SAD entry.  Otherwise,
      discard the packet and log an auditable event.

   For device that are dealing with different SPI SIZE SPI, the way
   inbound packets are handled differs from the [RFC4301].  In fact,
   when a inbound packet is received, the peer does not know the SPI



Migault (Ed), et al.    Expires September 4, 2014              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                  Diet-ESP                      March 2014


   SIZE.  As a result, it does not know the SPI that applies to the
   incoming packet.  The different values could be the 0 (resp. 1, 2, 3
   and 4) first bytes of the IP payload.

   Since the size of the SPI is not known for incoming packets, the
   detection of inbound SAs has to be redefined in a Diet-ESP
   environment.  In order to ensure a detection of a SA the above
   described regular detection have to be done for each supported SPI
   size (in most cases 5 times).  In most common cases this will return
   a unique Security Association.

   If there is more than one SA matching the lookup, the authentication
   MUST be performed for all found SAs to detect the SA with the correct
   key.  In case there is no match, the packet MUST be dropped.  Of
   course this can lead into DoS vulnerability as an attacker recognizes
   an overlap of one or more IP-SPI combinations.  Therefore it is
   highly recommended to avoid different values of the SPI SIZE for one
   tuple of Source and Destination IP address.  Furthermore this
   recommendation becomes mandatory if NULL authentication is supported.
   This is easy to implement as long as the sensors are not mobile and
   do not change their IP address.

   The following optimizations MAY be considered for sensor that are not
   likely to perform mobility or multihoming features provided by MOBIKE
   [RFC4555] or any change of IP address during the lifetime of the SA.

   Optimization 1 - SPI SIZE is mentioned inside the SPI: The SPI SIZE
   is defined as part of the SPI sent in each packet.  Therefore the
   receiver has to choose the most significant 2 bits of the SPI in the
   following way in order to recognize the right size for incoming Diet-
   ESP packets:

   00: SPI SIZE of 1 byte is used.

   01: SPI SIZE of 2 byte is used.

   10: SPI SIZE of 3 byte is used.

   11: SPI SIZE of 4 byte is used.

   If the the value 0 is chosen for the SPI SIZE this option does not
   feasible.

   Optimization 2 - IP address based lookup: IP addressed based search
   is one optimization one MAY choose to avoid several SAD lookups.  It
   is based on the IP address and the stored SPI SIZE, which MUST be the
   same value for each SA of one IP address.  Otherwise it can't neither
   be ensured that an SA is found nor that the correct one is found.

   Note that in case of mobile IP the SPI SIZE MUST be updated for all
   SAs related to the new IP address which may cause in renegotiation.
   Figure Figure 3 shows this lookup described below.

   1. Search most significant SA as follows:

      1.1 Search the first SA for a match on {destination address,
          source address}. If an SA entry matches, then process to step
          2.  Otherwise, proceed to step 1.2.

      1.2 Search the first SA for a match on {source address}. If an SA
          entry matches, then process to step 2.  Otherwise, drop the
          packet.

   2. Identify the size of the compressed SPI for the found SA, stored
      in the Diet-ESP context.  Note that all SAs to one IP address MUST
      have the same value for the SPI SIZE.  Then go to step 3.

   3. If the SPI SIZE is NOT zero, read the SPI SIZE SPI from the packet
      and perform a regular SAD lookup as described in [RFC4301].  If
      the SPI SIZE is zero, the SA from step 1 is unique and can be
      used.

   Note that some implementation MAY collect all SPI matching the IP
   addresses in step 2 to avoid an additional lookup over the whole SAD.
   This is implementation dependant.

   If the sensor is likely to change its IP address, the outcome MAY be
   a given IP address associated to different SPI SIZE.  This case MAY
   occur if one IP address has been used by a device not anymore online,
   but the SA has not been removed.  The IP has then been provided to
   another device.  In this case the Diet-ESP Context SHOULD NOT be
   accepted by the Security Gateway when the new Diet-ESP Context is
   provided to the Security Gateway.  At least the Security Gateway can
   check the previous peer is reachable and then delete the SA before
   accepting the new SA.

   Another case MAY be that a sensor got two interfaces with different
   IP addresses, negotiates a different SPI SIZE on each interface and
   then use MOBIKE to move the IPsec channels from one interface to the
   other.  In this case, the Security Gateway SHOULD NOT accept the
   update, or force a renegotiation of the SPI SIZE for all SAs,
   basically by re-keying the SAs.

6.2.3.  Outgoing Security Association Lookup

   Outgoing lookups for the SPI are performed in the same way as it is
   done in ESP.  The Traffic Selector for the packet is searched and the
   right SA is read from the SA.  The SPI used in the packet MUST be
   reduced to the value stored in SPI SIZE.

6.3.  Sequence Number

   Sequence number in ESP [RFC4303] can be of 4 bytes or 8 bytes for
   extended ESP.  Diet-ESP introduces different sizes.  One way to deal
   with this is to add a MAX_SN value that stores the maximum value the
   SN can have.  Any new value of the SN will be check against this
   MAX_SN.

6.4.  Outgoing Packet processing

   NH, TH, IH, P indicate fields or payloads that are removed from the
   Diet-ESP packet.  How the Diet-ESP packet is generated depends on the
   Payload Data of lPD bytes, BLCK the block size of the encryption
   algorithm and the device alignment ALIGN.  We note M = MAX(BLCK,
   ALIGN).  Although not normative the resulting Diet-ESP packet should
   be and explained below.  We consider the Diet-ESP Payload as
   described in Section 3

   - 1:  if TH is set to 1, then remove the transport layer of the
         Payload Data.

   - 2:  if IH is set to 1, and the IPsec mode is tunnel, then remove
         the inner IP address of the Payload Data.

   - 3:  if PAD is set to 0 and NH is set to 0: Diet-ESP considers both
         fields Pad Length and Next Header.  The Diet-ESP Payload is the
         encryption of the following clear text: Payload Data | Padding
         of Pad Length bytes | Pad Length field | Next Header field.
         The Pad Length value is such that lPD + 2 + Pad Length = 0 [M].

   - 4:  if PAD is set to 0 and NH is set to 1: Diet-ESP considers the
         Pad Length field but removes the Next Header field.  The ESP
         Payload is the encryption of the following clear text: Payload
         Data | Padding of Pad Length bytes | Pad Length field | Next
         Header field.  The Pad Length value is such that lPD + 1 + Pad
         Length = 0 [M].

   - 5:  if PAD is set to 1 and NH is set to 0: Diet-ESP considers the
         Next Header but do not consider the Pad Length field or the
         Padding Field.  This is valid as long as lPD + 1 = 0 [M].  If M
         = 1 as it is the case for AES-CTR this equation is always true.

         On the other hand the use of specific block size requires the
         application to send specific length of application data.

   - 6:  if PAD is set to 1 and NH is set to 1: Diet-ESP does consider
         neither the Next Header field nor the Pad Length field nor the
         Padding Field.  This is valid as long as lAD = 0 [M].  If M = 1
         as it is the case for AES-CTR this equation is always true.  On
         the other hand the use of specific block size requires the
         application to send specific length of application data.

6.5.  Inbound Packet processing

   Decryption is for performed the other way around.

   After SAD lookup, authenticating and decrypting the Diet-ESP payload
   the original packet is rebuild as follows:

   - 1:  if PAD is set to 1 and NH is set to 1: Diet-ESP does consider
         neither the Next Header field nor the Pad Length field nor the
         Padding Field.  The Next Header field of the IP packet is set
         to the protocol defined for incoming traffic within the Traffic
         Selector of the SA.  Because there is no Padding it is
         disregarded.

   - 2:  if PAD is set to 1 and NH is set to 0: Diet-ESP considers the
         Next Header but do not consider the Pad Length field or the
         Padding Field.  The Next Header field of the IP packet is set
         to the value within the Diet-ESP trailer.

   - 3:  if PAD is set to 0 and NH is set to 1: Diet-ESP considers the
         Pad Length field but removes the Next Header field.  The Next
         Header field of the IP packet is set to the protocol defined
         for incoming traffic within the Traffic Selector of the SA.
         The Pad Length field is read and the Padding is removed from
         the Data Payload which results the original Data Payload.

   - 4:  if PAD is set to 0 and NH is set to 0: Diet-ESP considers both
         fields Pad Length and Next Header.  The Next Header field of
         the IP packet is set to the value within the Diet-ESP trailer.
         The Pad Length field is read and the Padding is removed from
         the Data Payload which results the original Data Payload.

   - 5:  if IH is set to 1, and the IPsec mode is tunnel and the IP
         header is reconstructed.  The source and destination address
         and the Next Header field are read from the Traffic Selector.
         The Payload Length is calculated including the size of the
         transport header, regardless if it is removed with TH or not.
         All other IP-header values are set to common defaults or have

         to be negotiated otherwise which is out of scope of this
         document.

   -6:   if TH is set to 1, the Transport layer header is restored with
         the information in the Security Association.  Section 4
         describes some differences between the different protocols.  In
         this document we focus on UDP which can be easily restored with
         the ports inside the Traffic Selector.  The Length field can be
         calculated and the checksum can be left as 0 according to
         [RFC0768]

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA consideration for this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This section lists security considerations related to the Diet-ESP
   protocol.

   Small SPI SIZE exposes the device to DoS.  For a device, the number
   of SA is related to the number of SPI.  For systems using small SPI
   SIZE values as index of their database, the number of simultaneous
   communications is limited by the SPI SIZE.  This means that a given
   device initiating SPI SIZE communications can isolate the system.  In
   order to leverage this vulnerability, one can consider receiving
   systems that generate 32 bits SPI with a hash function that considers
   different parameters associated to the reduced SPI.  For example, if
   one use the IP addresses as well as the reduced SPI, the number of
   SPI becomes SPI SIZE per IP address.  This may be sufficient as
   sensors are not likely to perform multiple communications.

   Small size of ICV reduces the authentication strength.  For example 8
   bits mean that authentication can be spoofed with a probability of 1/
   256.  Standard value considers a length of 96 bit for reliable
   authentication.  If specified, the ICV field is truncated after the
   given number of bits which, for sure, has to be mentioned while
   incoming packet procession as well.  For removing authentication ESP
   NULL has to be negotiated, as described in RFC4303.

   Removing the SN prevents protection against replay attack.

   Diet-ESP is a protocol designed for the IoT, assuming to work in an
   IPv6 environment.  However, ESP is designed to work in every IP
   environment whereas Diet-ESP can be delivered in other IP
   environments like IPv4 as well.  This environment MAY cause the need
   of NAT.  In IPsec, UDP encapsulation is used to deal with NAT
   environments as described in [RFC3948].  Because UDP cannot define
   the underlying protocol with a Next Header, IKEv2 traffic is
   distinguished from ESP or AH traffic by sending the Non-ESP Marker (4
   bytes ZERO) after the UDP header.  As the SPI is considered to never
   be ZERO this clearly identifies IKEv2 traffic.

   In context of Diet-ESP the SPI MAY not be present in the Diet-ESP-
   header, which MAY corrupt this mechanism in case:

   - the 4 byte SN is ZERO

   - the SN is absent and the first 4 byte of the encrypted payload are
     ZERO

   - the compressed SN is ZERO AND the remaining bytes of the encrypted
     payload are ZERO

   Therefore an implementer has to define a way to ensure the first 4
   bytes are NOT zero.  We suggest the negotiated SPI to be at least 1
   byte if UDP encapsulation is enabled.

Appendix A.  Comparison

   This section compares the proposed Diet ESP with 6LoWPAN ESP
   [I-D.raza-6lowpan-ipsec] related to IoT use cases.  It shows the
   different ESP packet sent with the two compression methods.  In each
   case the maximum possible compression is used and the underlying UDP
   header is compressed as much as possible.  The big advantage of Diet
   ESP compression removing the UDP header appears.  Furthermore there
   are no additional compression configuration bytes to be sent in each
   packet, like done in 6LoWPAN compression, because the configuration
   is negotiated at the beginning of the communication the during the
   IKEv2 [RFC5996] negotiation.  Diet ESP uses the idea of ROHC[RFC5856]
   compression removing the disadvantage that the whole packet has to be
   sent once at the beginning of the connection, because it considers
   that a lot of information of the Security Association can be reused
   to decompress the packet.

   Both comparisons are using 8 bits alignment.  The figures are aligned
   to 16 bits to improve the readability.

A.1.  Transmitting 1 Byte without anti-replay

   6LoWPAN offers compression of the Sequence Number to 8, 16, 24 bit
   has to be sent in each packet, even if it is not going to be used.

   6LoWPAN does not offer to reduce the ICV as it is not removed with
   NULL-authentication.  Diet-ESP offers reducing to fair securely 64
   bits.

   AES-CTR is used for encryption.

   Figure 4a and 4b show this comparison.  The advantage of Diet ESP for
   this example is 96 bits.

A.2.  Transmitting 1 Byte to multi directional connections.

   Having multiple connections to one host implies the use of the SPI to
   identify the correct Security Association.  Diet ESP allows the
   reduction to 8, 16 and 24 bit. 6LoWPAN ESP offers quite the same
   reductions, except 24 bit.  In most sensor use cases 254 possible
   connection are more than enough, whereas the following two pictures
   show the advantage of Diet ESP against 6LoWPAN ESP for an 8 bit SPI.
   Since there is no possibility to remove the SN with 6LoWPAN it has to
   be at least 8 Bit.
