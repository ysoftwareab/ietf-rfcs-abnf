Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent STD 66
   [RFC3986] Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).  The intent is that
   these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB modules
   that would otherwise define their own representation(s).

Internet-Draft                   URI MIB                   February 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It defines a textual convention to represent STD 66 [RFC3986] URIs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines several textual conventions that may be imported by other MIB
   modules and used for object definitions.

   Whenever using limited-size arrays to implement objects using the
   textual conventions defined by this MIB module, implementers are
   encouraged to check length and bounds on input and memory in order to
   avoid introducing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  This advice is
   particularly important for URLs, which have frequently been exploited
   in this way in recent years.

   SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c messages are not considered secure.  It is
   recommended that the implementors consider the use of SNMPv3 messages
   and the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC
   3414 [RFC3414] and the View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC
   3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change) them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   URI-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is requested
   to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the URI-MIB module specified in this
   document.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This module was generated by editing together suggestions from Randy
   Presuhn, Dan Romascanu, Bill Fenner, Juergen Schoenwaelder, and
   others.  The 'author' was in this case more of a 'secretary'.
