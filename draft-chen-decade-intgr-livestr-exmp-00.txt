Internet-Draft   Leveraging In-network Storage in P2PLS     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   DECADE is an in-network storage infrastructure under discussions and
   constructions.  It can be integrated into Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
   applications to achieve more efficient content distributions.

   This draft introduces an instance of application integration with
   DECADE.  In our example system, the core component includes DECADE
   server and DECADE-aware P2P live stream client.  DECADE server
   running at Linux platform is designed to support data reading and
   writing for DECADE clients.  For DECADE client, we employed a P2P
   live streaming system called P2PLS (P2P Live Streaming).  We utilized
   a preliminary API (Application Programming Interface) set provided by
   DECADE to enable P2PLS clients to leverage DECADE in their data
   transmission.  In this draft, we introduce the system structure of
   the DECADE-P2PLS integration system, the main DECADE related message
   flow, the environment of the test on this integration, and the system
   performance in the test.

   Please note that P2PLS in this draft only represents the usage case
   of "live streaming" out of a large number of P2P applications, while
   DECADE itself can support other applications.  The API set of DECADE
   is only an experimental design and implementation.  It is not a
   standard and is still under development.


2.  Concepts

2.1.  DECADE Server

   DECADE Server is a server implemented DECADE protocols, management
   mechanism and storage strategies.  It is an important element to
   provide DECADE services.  In a DECADE server, we have a number of
   Data Lockers which are virtual accounts and storage space for
   applications.

2.2.  DECADE Client Plug-in

   DECADE Client Plug-in is a plug-in component for application clients
   to use DECADE server.  This plug-in component is served as an
   application-specific interface between a particular application and
   DECADE servers.  It can be a very simple component of basic DECADE
   access APIs implemented, or a smart component to integrate
   application-specific control strategies with DECADE APIs.

Internet-Draft   Leveraging In-network Storage in P2PLS     October 2010


2.3.  P2P LiveStreaming Client

   P2P LiveStreaming Client is our self-maintained version of a native
   P2P live streaming application.


3.  DECADE Client API

   In order to simplify the usage of DECADE server for P2P application
   clients, we provide a set of APIs.  On top of these APIs, a P2P
   application client can develop its application-specific control and
   data distributed policies to utilize DECADE servers.

   There are five basic APIs:

   o  Get_Object: to get an object from a DECADE server with an
      authorized token.  The get operation can be classified into two
      categories: Local Get and Remote Get. Local Get is to get an
      object from a local DECADE server.  Remote Get is to use an
      application's local DECADE server to indirectly get an object from
      a remote DECADE server.  The object will first passed to the local
      DECADE server, then return to the application client

   o  Put_Object: to store an object into a DECADE server with an
      authorized token.  An application client can either store an
      object in its local DECADE server or in other clients' DECADE
      servers, if it has a authorized token.  Both operates are directly
      store, we don't provide indirectly store (i.e. remote put).

   o  Delete_Object: to delete an object in a DECADE server explicitly
      with an authorized token.  Know that an object can be deleted
      implicitly by setting a expired time or a specific TTL.

   o  Status_Query: to query current status of an application itself,
      including a list of stored objects, resource usage, and so on.  An
      application cannot query others' status.

   o  Generate_Token: to generate an authorized token.  The token can be
      used to access an application client's local DECADE server, or
      passed to other clients to allow others to access its DECADE
      server.


4.  DECADE Integration of P2P LiveStreaming Client

   We integrate DECADE client API with a P2P live streaming application,
   in order that clients of this P2P live streaming application can
   easily utilize DECADE server in their data transport processes.

4.1.  DECADE Client Plug-in

   DECADE Client Plug-in is a plug-in component, on top of DECADE client
   APIs, designed for application clients to use DECADE server.  This
   plug-in component serves as an application-specific interface between
   a particular application and DECADE servers.  In this test, we
   employed P2P live streaming application to leverage this plug -in.

4.2.  DECADE Integration Architecture

   The architecture of the P2P live streaming and DECADE integration is
   in Figure 1:

               +---------------+                       +---------------+
               |    DECADE     |                       |    DECADE     |
               |     Peer      |                       |     Peer      |
               |+-------------+|   +---------------+   |+-------------+|
               ||DECADE Client |---| DECADE Server |---||DECADE Client||
               |+------^------+|   +---------------+   |+------^------+|
               |   API |       |                       |   API |       |
               |+------v------+|   +---------------+   |+------v------+|
               ||Native Client||---|    Tracker    |---||Native Client||
               |+-------------+|   +---------------+   |+-------------+|
               +---------------+                       +---------------+

                                 Figure 1

   A DECADE integrated P2P live streaming client uses DECADE client
   plug-in to communicate with its DECADE server and access data between
   itself and DECADE servers.  It uses an additional modified message
   protocol, as well as its original P2P message protocols to connect
   with other peers, exchange control messages.

4.2.1.  Data Access

   DECADE client plug-in is called whenever the application want to get
   data objects from (or put data objects into) DECADE servers.  Every
   data object transferred between DECADE server and original P2P live
   streaming client must go through this plug-in.  Neither the DECADE
   server and the original client knows each other.  A Data object is a
   transfer unit of data, between DECADE servers and application
   clients.  It the size of data object can be application-customized,
   according to variable requirements of performance or sensitive
   factors (e.g. low latency, high bandwidth utilization).

4.2.2.  Message Control

   Control and Data plane decoupling is a design principle of DECADE.
   Control messages are propagated in an original P2P way.  Besides,
   original P2P control messages, a modified message protocol is needed
   for DECADE authorized token delivery.  By exchanging DECADE
   authorized tokens, P2P live streaming clients can retrieve or store
   data objects into or from other clients' DECADE servers.


5.  Test Environment and Settings

   In order to demo our DECADE integrated P2P live streaming
   application, we conduct an test in Amazon EC2 and PlanetLab to show
   the performance of the system.  For comparison, we conduct two tests,
   DECADE integrated P2P live streaming and native P2P live streaming,
   in the same environment use the same setting.

5.1.  Test Settings

   Our test ran on a wide-spread area and a diverse platforms,including
   a famous commercial cloud platform and a well-known testbed
   PlanetLab.  The environment settings are as following:

   o  EC2 Regions: we setup DECADE servers in Amazon EC2 cloud,
      including all four regions around the world, US east, US west,
      Europe and Asia.

   o  PlanetLab: we run our P2P live streaming clients (both DECADE
      integrated and native clients) on PlanetLab of a wild-spread area.

   o  Arrival pattern: we let all the clients join at the same time to
      simulate a flash crown scenario.

   o  Total Bandwidth: for fair comparison, we set the system's total
      supply bandwidth to be exact the same in both test.

5.2.  Platforms and Components

   In our test, we have different functional components running in
   different platforms, including DECADE servers, P2P live streaming
   clients(DECADE integrated or Native), Tracker, Source server and Test
   Controller, as shown in Figure 2.

                                 Figure 2

5.2.1.  EC2 DECADE Server

   DECADE Servers ran on Amazon EC2 small instances, with bandwidth
   constraint.

5.2.2.  PlanetLab P2P LiveStreaming Client

   Both DECADE integrated and Native P2P live streaming clients run in
   planetlab spreading in different locations in the world.  The DECADE
   integrated P2P live streaming clients connect to a closest DECADE
   server according to its Geo-location distance of the servers.  DECADE
   integrated P2P live streaming clients use their DECADE servers to
   upload to neighbors, instead of their own "last-mile" bandwidth.

5.2.3.  Tracker

   A native P2P live streaming tracker ran in our lab to serve for both
   DECADE integrated clients and native clients during the test.

5.2.4.  Source Server

   A native P2P live streaming source server ran in our lab to serve for
   both DECADE integrated clients and native clients during the test.
   The capacity of source is equivalently constrain for both cases.

5.2.5.  Test Controller

   Test Controller is a manager to control all machines behaviors in
   both EC2 and PlanetLab during the test.


6.  Performance Analysis

   During the test, DECADE integrated P2P live streaming clients achieve
   a better performance in the results.

6.1.  Performance Metrics

   o  Startup Delay: the time from a peer joins the channel to the
      moment it starts to play.

   o  Piece Missed Rate: number of pieces a peer missed in the playing
      buffer to total number of pieces.

   o  Freeze Times: number of a peer freeze during playing.

   o  Average Peer Uploading Rate: Average uploading bandwidth of a peer
      per second.

6.2.  Result and Analysis

   o  Startup Delay: In the test, DECADE integrated P2P live streaming
      clients startup around 35~40 seconds. some of them startup at
      about 10 seconds.  Native P2P live streaming clients startup
      around 110~120 seconds. less than 20% of them startup within 100
      seconds.

   o  Piece Missed Rate: In the test, both DECADE integrated P2P live
      streaming clients and native P2P live streaming clients achieved a
      good performance in pieces missed rate.  Only about 0.02% of total
      pieces missed in both cases.

   o  Freeze Times: In the test, native P2P live streaming clients
      suffered from 40% more freeze than DECADE Integrated P2P live
      streaming clients.

   o  Average Peer Uploading Rate: In the test, according to our
      settings, DECADE integrated P2P live streaming clients had no
      upload in their "last-mile" access network.  More than 70% of
      peers uploaded much more than streaming rate.  That is to say,
      much uploading bandwidth are waste during data transport.
