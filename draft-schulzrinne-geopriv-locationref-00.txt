Abstract

   Mobile devices sometimes want to give temporary access to their
   presence and location information to third parties that may not have
   a trust relationship with their presence server.  Also, in addition
   to other mechanisms, application-layer location configuration
   protocols are helpful in building location-based systems.  This
   document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package,
   locationref, that periodically delivers randomized presence URLs to

   the target, which the target can then hand to call recipients and
   other parties.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   This document reuses terminology introduced by RFC 3693 [7] and [12].
   We use the term Location Information Server (LIS) and Presence Server
   (PS) interchangable


2.  Introduction

   End systems need to be able to determine their geographic location,
   so that they can convey this information using SIP [2] or other
   protocols.  Among many other possibilities, end systems can obtain
   location information from a location information server (LIS) via an
   application-layer protocol.  The motivation and requirements for such
   a protocol are discussed in [12].  In particular, it is desirable
   that such a protocol work for mobile end systems, without requiring
   the end system to poll the LIS to find out if its location has
   changed.  Thus, we need an event notification mechanism.  Given the
   availability of SIP event notification [4] and the use of SIP for
   other purposes in many end systems, it makes sense to provide a SIP-
   based event notification for location-related events.  This document
   defines the necessary event package.

   Since the end system may move after sending location information in
   an INVITE request [13], for example, it is sometimes desirable to
   have the end system obtain a reference to a location object that can
   be converted into an event subscription by any recipient of such a
   reference, even if the LIS does not know the the location recipient
   and it has no way to verify the identity of the location recipient.
   For example, in emergency calling, the PSAP or first-responder may
   want to track the location of the caller during the emergency, but it
   is unlikely that a LIS can authenticate the PSAP or first responder.

   Reflecting the needs of the end system and other system components,
   we define a new event package, locationref, that can be combined with
   the 'presence' event package [8] to support two operational modes.
   In both cases, the LIS, acting as a presence agent (PA), periodically
   delivers a new randomized SIP URL to the watcher via SIP NOTIFY
   requests.  This randomized SIP URL can be used, without further
   authentication and authorization, to subscribe to presence
   information for the end system, typically including location
   information encoded as a PIDF-LO [10].  We refer to this SIP URL as a
   randomized presence retrieval URL, or an RPRU for short.

Internet-Draft                 locationref                  October 2006


   The RPRU has a finite, typically short, lifetime and becomes invalid
   after that time expires.  For the applications envisioned, such as
   emergency calling or location-based delivery services, it appears
   sufficient for a URL to be valid for about one hour.  Since the
   target to be located may distribute the URL just before the next one
   is delivered, the RPRU MUST be valid at least one hour beyond its
   replacement.  Thus, the LIS must store randomized URLs with
   overlapping lifetime for each target and MUST provide a new URL one
   hour before the last one expires.  For the default validity period of
   one hour, a new URL is delivered via NOTIFY once an hour, with the
   randomized URL having a validity period of two hours.

   The system can operate in two modes:

   Network-identifier-based location:  In this mode, the end system
      subscribes to the locationref at the LIS, providing one or more
      node identifiers as event package parameters.  Here, we define the
      IP address, MAC address and a switch-and-port identifier, but
      other node identifiers can be added in the future.  The end system
      does not authenticate with the LIS and does not use its SIP
      address-of-record (AOR).
   AOR-based location reference:  Here, the end system subscribes to
      location references based on its AOR, rather than a network
      identifier.  In particular, the UA may provide the location
      information to the PA via PUBLISH [5] requests.  For example, a UA
      with a built-in GPS receiver could PUBLISH geolocation updates to
      the PA, and then hand out SIP URLs to callees that need to
      temporarily track or obtain its location.

   TBD: It might be desirable to allow end systems to directly subscribe
   to presence information using the node identifiers, to avoid the
   duplicate notifications and subscriptions.  This would require
   extending the presence event package [8] with additional parameters
   or creating a new 'location' event package parallel to the package
   defined here.

   Figure 1 shows a protocol exchange that allows the UA to obtain a
   RPRU pointing to a PIDF-LO stored at the LIS in the access network.
   Note that the discovery exchange is not known in this figure and it
   it also not described in this document.  First, the target sends a
   SUBSCRIBE with the event package 'locationref'.  This message is
   protected using Transport Layer Security, which is also not shown in
   the figure.  The LIS, for example, uses the IP address of the target
   (as carried in the SUBSCRIBE request) to determine its current
   location information and creates a RPRU.  The RPRU is returned to the
   Target in a NOTIFY message (here, xu...56@lis for short).  The
   subsequent exchange points to a potential usage case of conveying
   location information to a location recipient whereby the RPRU is then

   carried in an INVITE message.  A location recipient then uses the
   obtained reference to initiate a SUBSCRIBE followed by a NOTIFY
   message containing a PIDF-LO.

3.  Assumptions

   This document makes the following assumptions:
   o  The LIS is located in the access network and a corresponding LIS
      discovery mechanism is available, for example via a reverse DNS
      lookup or a DHCP option.
   o  The LIS discovery procedure makes the domain name required for the
      SIP URI available to the target.





Schulzrinne              Expires April 20, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 locationref                  October 2006


   o  The target is not assumed to share credentials with the LIS.  The
      target does not authenticate to the LIS when creating the RPRU.
   o  This document only creates presence URIs that can be resolved into
      location objects by using the SIP presence mechanisms.
   o  The usage of authorization policies for controlling the access to
      PIDF-LOs are not envisioned or at least they are not provided by
      the target itself.


4.  Goals

   This document aims to provide a mechanism that offers the following
   functionality:
   o  It enables the end host to obtain a reference to a PIDF-LO from
      the LIS.  The LIS is a SIP presence server.  The reference is in
      the form of a a presence URI, the RPRU.
   o  The entity that knows the reference can subscribe to it in order
      to obtain the location object in the form of a PIDF-LO [10].
      Every entity that is in possession of the RPRU can resolve it.
      There are no authorization policies that need to be uploaded from
      the target, or any other node, to the LIS for access control of a
      potential location recipient.  Any node can play the role of a
      location recipient as long as it knows the RPRU (e.g., the Target,
      a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or location/presence
      server).


5.  Finding the LIS

   The LIS can be discovered via DHCP, as described in [TBD].  If there
   is no such mechanism, the UA employs the normal SIP location
   mechanism [3], using its own domain name as the host name.  The
   domain is determined from the domain name of the end host, typically
   conveyed as part of the configuration information or obtainable from
   the public IP address via DNS PTR records.  (This mechanism works
   only if the end host is not designated as the SIP server for itself.)


6.  PIDF/PIDF-LO Parameter Setting

   To ensure the privacy of the target, the location object returned by
   the RPRU should observe certain conventions.  Also, since the PIDF-LO
   itself is created by a node that does not know a number of parameters
   it needs to be constructed in a way that is privacy safe.  The
   following PIDF-LO parameter usage is REQUIRED:

   'usage-rules' Element:
      retransmission-allowed:  This element MUST be set to 'no'.
      retention-expires:  This field specifies an absolute date at which
         time the Recipient is no longer permitted to possess the
         location information and its encapsulating Location Object.
         The value of this field MUST be computed based on the lifetime
         of the presence URI, i.e., the Location Object and the presence
         URI MUST have the same lifetime.
      ruleset-reference:  This element SHOULD NOT contain a URI to an
         external set of privacy rules.  Reason: The LIS is less likely
         in the position to know the reference to the ruleset.
      note-well:  This element SHOULD NOT contain a human readable
         privacy statement.  Reason: The LIS does not know the human
         readable privacy statement of the user.
   'method' Element:  This element SHOULD contain information about the
      way how location information was derived or discovered.
   'provided-by' Element:  This element might SHOULD contain the entity
      or organization that supplied this location information.  Since
      the PIDF-LO is not signed it is highly RECOMMMENDED to provide
      information within this element.
   'entity' Attribute of the <presence> Element:  The value of the
      'entity' attribute (see [9]) MUST be set based on the RPRU.


7.  Event Package Formal Definition

   This section fills in the information required for all event packages
   by RFC 3265 [4].

7.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in [4].  The
   event-package token name for this package is:


     "locationref"

7.2.  Event Package Parameters

   This package defines an extensible set of event parameters that are
   used to identify the user agent as a network node.  Currently, three
   identifiers are described; their tradeoffs are enumerated in the
   [12].  Additional parameters can be defined through an IANA registry.

Internet-Draft                 locationref                  October 2006


   ip The 'ip' parameter contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address, written in
      the format specified in [6], as either IP-literal or IPv4address.
      An example is ;ip="192.0.34.186".  If this parameter is included,
      the SIP Contact header field MUST be identical to this value.
      (TBD: How to ensure that only the real owners of the IP address
      can usefully insert this address in the event parameter.)
   mac  The 'mac' parameter contains an IEEE MAC address written in IEEE
      EUI-64 or EUI-48 notation, with lower-case hexadecimal characters
      separated by colons.  An example is ;mac="0:3:fc:0:ca:27".
   msap  The 'msap' parameter identifies a MAC service access point,
      typically a switch chassis and port.  If derived from LLDP (IEEE
      802.1ab), it is encoded in base64.  (TBD: Should there be a
      separate identifier for CDP and other protocols that provide
      alphanumeric chassis and port information?)

   End systems SHOULD provide all available identifiers.  The PA can
   choose any one of the parameters, depending on its own internal
   database and possibly on which identifier is less subject to
   spoofing.

7.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   A SUBSCRIBE request body MAY contain a filter or policy document
   restricting access to the information accessible through the
   randomized URL.  (TBD: This might allow the UA to upload information
   to the LIS that can then be placed in the PIDF-LO but introduces
   complexity and might raise a number of privacy concerns.  Instead of
   sending the RPRU directly to location recipients the UA makes the
   RPRU available to its presence server and thereby ensures that
   authorization policies are applied in the classical fashion.)

7.4.  Subscription Duration

   Typically, an end system would either perform a one-time subscription
   with zero duration or continuously acquire new randomized location
   URLs.  By default, NOTIFY requests will be delivered to the watcher
   at the rate of one per hour, so that a subscription duration of one
   day (86400 seconds) is chosen as a default to amortize the
   subscription overhead over a sufficient number of notifications.  As
   per RFC 3265 [4], the subscriber MAY specify an alternate expiration
   in the Expires header field.

7.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   Notifiers MAY send location information in any format acceptable to
   the subscriber, based on the information contained in the Accept
   header field in the SUBSCRIBE request.  All implementations of this
   event package MUST support the text/uri-list content type and deliver

Internet-Draft                 locationref                  October 2006


   one or more randomized URLs to the watcher.  All such URIs have the
   same functionality, but may use different schemes.  The ordering of
   the URLs is immaterial.  The username part of the presence URI MUST
   NOT contain any information that identifies the user, device or
   address of record.  The username part of the presence URI MUST be
   hard to guess, i.e., it MUST contain a cryptographically random
   component of at least 128 bit length.

7.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   SUBSCRIBE requests are addressed to the host name of the LIS, without
   a 'user' part in the request URI.  For example, if the LIS resides at
   lis.example.com, the SUBSCRIBE request is directed to sip:
   lis.example.com.

   When the notifier receives a SUBSCRIBE request, it attempts to verify
   that the event parameters indeed belong to the subscribing UAC.

7.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   Immediately after a subscription has been accepted, the notifier MUST
   send a NOTIFY with a new RPRU.  One hour before the expiration of the
   last RPRU, the notifier sends a new RPRU.

7.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   There are no special rules for locationref NOTIFY requests.

7.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   This document follows the presence event package [8], Section 6.9, in
   handling forked SUBSCRIBE requests.

7.10.  Rate of Notifications

   By default, this event package will generate a new RPRU every hour.
   Shorter intervals are unlikely to be useful, given the need for the
   RPRU to be valid for a reasonable time period.

7.11.  State Agents

   This document does not preclude implementations from building state
   agents which support this event package.  Likewise, this document

8.  Examples

   In the examples below, we omit standard responses for brevity.  We
   assume that the UA, located at host17.example.com (192.0.34.166), has
   determined the location of the LIS, e.g., via DHCP, here
   lis.example.com.




         SUBSCRIBE sip:lis.example.com SIP/2.0
         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP target.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKnashds7
         To: &lt;sip:lis.example.com>
         From: &lt;sip:target.example.com>;tag=xfg9
         Call-ID: 2010@target.example.com
         CSeq: 17866 SUBSCRIBE
         Max-Forwards: 70
         Event: locationref;ip="192.0.34.166";mac="0:3:fc:0:ca:27"
         Accept: text/uri-list
         Contact: &lt;sip:user@target.example.com>
         Expires: 86400
         Content-Length: 0



   The NOTIFY returned by the LIS might look as follows:




         NOTIFY sip:user@target.example.com SIP/2.0
         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP server.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
         From: &lt;sip:lis.example.com>;tag=ffd2
         To: &lt;sip:user@target.example.com>;tag=xfg9
         Call-ID: 2010@target.example.com
         Event: locationref
         Subscription-State: active;expires=86399
         Max-Forwards: 70
         CSeq: 8775 NOTIFY
         Contact: sip:lis.example.com
         Content-Type: text/uri-list
         Content-Length: ...

         # your random presence retrieval URL, valid for two hours
         sips:nt5n09r97952....816@lis.example.com

Internet-Draft                 locationref                  October 2006


   The UAC then inserts this URL into outgoing SIP requests, such as




         INVITE urn:service:sos SIP/2.0
         Geolocation: sips:nt5n09r97952....816@lis.example.com






         SUBSCRIBE sip:nt5n09r97952x816@lis.example.com SIP/2.0
         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP psap.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKxkuvads7
         To: &lt;sip:nt5n09r97952x816@lis.example.com>
         From: &lt;sip:alice@psap.example.net>;tag=xab1
         Call-ID: 1234@psap.example.com
         CSeq: 4986 SUBSCRIBE
         Max-Forwards: 70
         Event: presence
         Accept: application/pidf+xml
         Contact: &lt;sip:alice@psap.example.com>
         Expires: 3600
         Content-Length: 0



   If the RPRU is still valid, the LIS will return




         NOTIFY sip:alice@psap.example.com SIP/2.0
         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP lis.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
         From: &lt;sip:nt5n09r97952x816@lis.example.com>;tag=ffd2
         To: &lt;sip:user@example.com>;tag=xab1
         Call-ID: 1234@psap.example.com
         Event: presence
         Subscription-State: active;expires=4200
         Max-Forwards: 70
         CSeq: 7812 NOTIFY
         Contact: sip:lis.example.com

9.  Applicability Statement

   A future version of this document will provide information regarding
   its appliability.


10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [12] apply here.

   Without a cryptographic identifier for hosts, there are only two
   mechanisms for making it difficult for end systems to impersonate
   other devices.  First, the LIS can enforce return routability, so
   that only the network-layer originator of the request can see a
   response or subsequent message.  Secondly, another protocol can be
   used to deliver an 'identifier' to the end system that can only be
   seen by that end system and is used as a lookup key in the SUBSCRIBE
   request.  For example, if the MSAP is sufficiently long and
   cryptographically random, a third party would not be able to guess
   the value and obtain the location keys of other nodes.  The IP
   address and the MAC address obviously do not fulfill this
   requirement.

   The security of the randomized URL depends on the channel security of
   the protocols used to carry it.  For conveyance within SIP, use of
   SIPS is RECOMMENDED.


11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  Registration of a new event package

   Package name:  locationref
   Type:  package
   Contact:  Schulzrinne
   Published Specification:  This document.

11.2.  Registration of event parameters

   This document requests that IANA establish a registry for event
   parameters for the locationref event package.


12.  Acknowledgments

   This document has been influenced by the earlier work by Rohan Mahy,
   in the expired Internet draft draft-mahy-geopriv-sip-loc-pkg.  The
   notion of randomized URLs has been discussed under the label of "pawn
