Abstract

  This document specifies how to incorporate CAST-128 [RFC2144] into 
  S/MIME as an additional algorithm for symmetric encryption.  The 
  relevant OIDs and processing steps are provided so that CAST-128 
  may be included in the S/MIME Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
  specification [RFC2630] for symmetric content and key encryption.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
  "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
  as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet Draft             CAST-128 in S/MIME            September  1999


1. Motivation

  S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) [SMIME2, 
  SMIME3] is a set of specifications for the secure transport of MIME
  objects.  In the current (S/MIME v3) specifications the mandatory-
  to-implement symmetric algorithm for content encryption and key 
  encryption is triple-DES (3DES).  While this is perfectly acceptable
  in many cases because the security of 3DES is generally considered to
  be high, for some environments 3DES may be seen to be too slow.  In 
  part to help alleviate such performance concerns, S/MIME has allowed
  any number of (optional) additional algorithms to be used for 
  symmetric content and key encryption.

  The CAST-128 encryption algorithm [RFC2144, Adams] is a well-studied 
  symmetric cipher that has a number of appealing features, including
  relatively high performance and a variable key size (from 40 bits
  to 128 bits).  It is available royalty-free and license-free for
  commercial and non-commercial uses worldwide [IPR], and therefore
  is widely used in a number of applications around the Internet.  It 
  thus seems to be a suitable optional encryption algorithm for S/MIME.

  This document describes how to use CAST-128 within the S/MIME CMS
  specification.


2. Specification

  This section provides the OIDs and processing information necessary
  for CAST-128 to be used for content and key encryption in CMS.


2.1 OIDs for Content and Key Encryption

  CAST-128 is added to the set of optional symmetric encryption 
  algorithms in S/MIME by providing two unique object identifiers 
  (OIDs).  One OID defines the content encryption algorithm and the 
  other defines the key encryption algorithm.  Thus an S/MIME agent can 
  apply CAST-128 either for content or key encryption by selecting the 
  corresponding object identifier, supplying the required parameter, and 
  starting the program code. 

  For content encryption the use of CAST-128 in cipher block chaining 
  (CBC) mode is RECOMMENDED.  The key length is variable (from 40 to 128 
  bits in 1-octet increments). 

  The CAST-128 content-encryption algorithm in CBC mode has the 
  following object identifier:

    cast5CBC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {iso(1) member-body(2) 
        us(840) nt(113533) nsn(7) algorithms(66) 10}

Internet Draft             CAST-128 in S/MIME            September  1999


  The parameter associated with this object identifier contains the 
  initial vector IV and the key length:

    cast5CBCParameters ::= SEQUENCE {
        iv         OCTET STRING DEFAULT 0,  
        -- Initialization vector
        keyLength  INTEGER                  
        -- Key length, in bits
    }

  Comments regarding the use of the IV may be found in [RFC2144].

  The key-wrap/unwrap procedures used to encrypt/decrypt a CAST-128 
  content-encryption key with a CAST-128 key-encryption key are 
  specified in the Section 2.2.  Generation and distribution of 
  key-encryption keys are beyond the scope of this document. 

  The CAST-128 key-encryption algorithm has the following object 
  identifier:

    cast5CMSkeywrap OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) 
        member-body(2) us(840) nt(113533) nsn(7) 
        algorithms(66) 15} 

  The parameter associated with this object identifier contains only
  the key length (because the key wrapping procedure itself defines
  how and when to use an IV):

    cast5CMSkeywrapParameter ::= INTEGER
      -- key length, in bits


2.2 Key Wrapping and Unwrapping

  CAST-128 key wrapping and unwrapping is done in conformance with CMS 
  [RFC2630].


2.2.1 CAST-128 Key Wrap

  Key wrapping with CAST-128 is identical to [RFC2630], Sections 12.6.1 
  and 12.6.4, with "RC2" replaced by "CAST-128" in the introduction to 
  12.6.4.


2.2.2 CAST-128 Key Unwrap

  Key unwrapping with CAST-128 is identical to [RFC2630], Sections 
  12.6.1 and 12.6.5, with "RC2" replaced by "CAST-128" in the 
  introduction to 12.6.5.

3. Discussion

  An S/MIME client should announce the set of cryptographic functions 
  it supports by using the S/MIME capabilities attribute. This 
  attribute provides a partial list of OIDs of cryptographic functions 
  and MUST be signed by the client. The functions' OIDs should be 
  logically separated in functional categories and MUST be ordered with
  respect to their preference. If an S/MIME client is required to 
  support symmetric encryption with CAST-128, the capabilities attribute 
  MUST contain the above specified OIDs in the category of symmetric 
  algorithms.  The parameters associated with the OIDs given above may
  be used to indicate supported key length.  Alternatively, the 
  following parameter from http://www.imc.org/ietf-smime/smime-oids.asn 
  may be used in the S/MIME capabilities attribute instead:

    SMIMECapabilitiesParametersForCast5CBC ::= INTEGER
    --        CAST Key Length (number of bits)
    --        (key size:  40, 64, 80 or 128)

  Note that this parameter restricts the range of possible CAST-128 key
  sizes to four, but this should be acceptable for many environments.

  When a sending agent creates an encrypted message, it has to decide
  which type of encryption algorithm to use. In general the decision 
  process involves information obtained from the capabilities lists 
  included in messages received from the recipient, as well as other
  information such as private agreements, user preferences, legal 
  restrictions, and so on. If users require CAST-128 for symmetric 
  encryption, it MUST be supported by the S/MIME clients on both the 
  sending and receiving side, and it MUST be set in the user 
  preferences.



4. Security Considerations

  This document specifies the use of the CAST-128 symmetric cipher for 
  encrypting the content of an S/MIME message and for encrypting the 
  symmetric key used to encrypt the content of an S/MIME message.  
  Although CAST-128 allows keys of variable length to be used, it must
  be recognized that smaller key sizes (e.g., 40, 56, or 64 bits) may be 
  unacceptably weak for some environments.  The use of larger key sizes 
  (e.g., 128 bits) is always RECOMMENDED (when relevant import, export, 
  or other laws permit).  It is also RECOMMENDED that the size of the
  content-encryption key and the size of the key-encryption key be equal
  (since the security of the content will be at most the smaller of
  these two values).
