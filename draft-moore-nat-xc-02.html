<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (for NAT with
      Explicit Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6.  NAT-XC
      is distinguished from other IPv4/IPv6 translations schemes in that it
      separates the translation between IPv4 and IPv6 from the management
      of address bindings for such a translation; and is designed to allow
      applications to be explicitly aware of, and control, their
      address bindings. NAT-XC can be used by both IPv4 clients
      wishing to communicate via IPv6, and IPv6 clients wishing to
      communicate via IPv4.   NAT-XC appears to be usable in a wide variety
      of scenarios requiring communication across IPv4/IPv6 boundaries.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>
This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (or NAT with
Explicit Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6, with the
following characteristics:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The translation is explicitly controlled (e.g. its address bindings
  are created, maintained, and discarded) from a remote location using a
  well-defined protocol, rather than having the bindings maintained
  at the point at which translation occurs using traffic analysis and
  heuristics.
</li>
<li>Such control may be accomplished from any of several points,
  including from one of the endpoints participating in a conversation,
  or even (when necessary or desirable) by an application.
</li>
<li>Any party wishing to conduct a conversation across address realm
  boundaries, may arrange for the translation without knowledge of, or
  cooperation by, other parties.
</li>
<li>While the most common deployment of NAT-XC is assumed to locate the
  translation at the periphery of an enterprise network or within the
  enterprise's ISP, such translation may occur, via explicit 
  arrangement, at any location on the network which has both public 
  IPv4 and public IPv6 network access.
</li>
<li>An application using the translator to accept inbound traffic from
  a remote address realm, is able to be informed of its endpoint
  addresses in that realm, as well as the endpoint addresses of its peers.
</li>
</ul><p>
This mechanism is believed to have the following benefits:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Deployability.
<br />
<br />

  This single mechanism is adaptable to suit a wide variety of
  application configurations, network constraints, and operator
  requirements.  Because the translation can be accomplished at a 
  variety of network locations, operators have a great deal of
  flexibility as to how they arrange for such translation.  The
  mechanism can accommodate IPv4-only networks, IPv6-only networks,
  legacy hosts without IPv4 capability, applications written to a
  dual-stack model, and applications written to an IPv4-only
  model. The mechanism can also function when the client host is
  behind a legacy IPv4 NAT.
<br />
<br />


  Because NAT-XC is able to translate packets for either IPv4-only or
  IPv6-only clients, it allows either of two hosts wishing to
  communicate (one using IPv4, the other using IPv6) to make itself
  accessible to the other.
<br />
<br />


  NAT-XC also avoids the need to upgrade multiple components of the
  network before any application can communicate across the
  IPv4/IPv6 boundary.  Any of several mechanisms can be used to
  adapt an application to use a NAT-XC translator; and the NAT-XC
  translator itself can either be provided locally, or by the
  network's ISP, or outsourced to a third party.

</li>
<li>Minimizes the need for ALGs (including DNS ALG).
<br />
<br />

In many cases, NAT-XC permits applications written to a dual-stack
programming model to function as if they had direct access to both
native IPv4 and native IPv6 networks.  Applications written to a
dual-stack model are presumed to be aware of both IPv4 and IPv6, and
therefore, to also be aware of details of using higher-level protocols
with IPv4 and IPv6 (e.g. address literals, DNS AAAA records, FTP EPRT
vs. PORT, and so forth).  
<br />
<br />

However, some applications, such as those written to an IPv4-only
model, will not be aware of these differences. Those applications will need
protocol translation to be implemented by ALGs in order to effectively
interoperate with peers speaking only IPv6.  Unfortunately, ALGs, when
applied indiscriminately to all traffic, can interfere with the
interoperation of applications that do not need ALGs.
<br />
<br />

The NAT-XC architecture minimizes unnecessary use of ALGs as follows:
First, by separating the management of address bindings from the address
translation, it becomes possible for the address binding management to
be implemented closer to the application. So a network library or
network stack that supports NAT-XC can provide a means to enable or
disable ALGs on a per-application basis.  Second, the NAT-XC
architecture allows the bindings to be managed by the application
itself, pre-empting any binding management that might otherwise be
provided by lower layers.  Third, for those cases when the binding
control is implemented in a Control Router, the NAT-XC Control
Protocol has the provision to explicitly disable ALGs.  This makes it
possible for an application to disable ALGs that might have
otherwise interfered with its interoperation.

</li>
<li>Provides a predictable programming environment for applications.  
<br />
<br />


  With NAT-XC it is possible for application vendors and authors to 
  ship a single application binary that will work correctly across
  IPv4/IPv6 realm boundaries in a wide range of customer environments,
  ranging anywhere from a dual-stack host with access to both public
  IPv4 and  public IPv6, to a IPv4-only host running on an IPv4-only
  network located behind a legacy NAT.  Such an application would be
  able to use a NAT-XC translator provided by the customer's network
  if one existed, or be explicitly configured to use a remote NAT-XC
  translator with which the operator had arranged to use.

</li>
<li>Separates network security policy from address translation.  
<br />
<br />


  An application request for an address binding can be refused with an
  error indicating that such communication is a violation of local
  policy.  This provides a means for applications to be aware of the
  difference between security policy, and the limitations imposed by a
  traditional NAT.  Such an application can then report failures due
  to security policy to its operator or user (and the NAT-XC
  translator can also report failed requests), while continuing to
  work around other network limitations or problems that are not
  policy related.

</li>
<li>Encourages a desirable end-state for the Internet.  
<br />
<br />

NAT-XC is designed to ease the transition to an Internet in which
IPv6 network access is sufficient for a host in order to reach all
other hosts of interest (when not prohibited by network policy).
In the near term, NAT-XC allows applications to communicate across
the IPv4/IPv6 boundary without requiring major changes to the
hosts and networks on which they reside.  In the long term, NAT-XC
allows applications to operate on an IPv6-only network even if they
still need to occasionally communicate with hosts using IPv4.
NAT-XC thus reduces the near-term burden of transition, while still
permitting cross-realm operation, and allows changes to a
network's infrastructure to be decoupled from IPv6 transition and
deferred until a later date.
<br />
<br />

It appears that, in a future Internet where NAT-XC were widely
supported by software, the greatest functionality with the least
overhead would be achieved by a configuration where most applications
were written to a dual-stack model, and where most enterprise networks
were IPv6-only. Other configurations could be similarly functional,
but have greater overhead.  It is assumed that networks would
eventually migrate to the configuration with lower operational cost.

Terminology</h3>

<p>
NAT-XC defines a Translator, which mediates between a Client
Application and one or more other Address Realms to which the Client
Application lacks direct access.  The translation allows the Client
Application to communicate with a Peer Application.  The Translator is
controlled by a Control Protocol.  Control Protocol messages are
exchanged between the Translator and the Control Point.  The Control
Point is responsible for establishing and maintaining the bindings
used by an application.  The Control Point for a particular binding
may be located at any one of several locations along the signal path
between the Client Application and the Translator, or at the Client
Application itself.
<br />
<br />


(Note that the use of the term Client Application does not imply that
the application has a client role in the sense of the client-server
model.  The Client Application may originate outbound connections or accept
inbound connections, or both.)
<br />
<br />


Control Protocol messages sent by a Control Point are addressed to a
Control Address and Port (CAP) assigned to the Translator.  Such
packets are not translated, but are used to control Translator
operation.

The signal path between the Client Application to Peer Application is
shown in <a class='info' href='#fig1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Signal Path Between Client and Peer Applications</span><span>)</span></a>.  The path taken by a packet sent by the Client
Application to the Peer Application is described as follows:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
The Client Application emits packets from the Client Host with a
Private Client Address (PrCA) as the IP source address and a Private
Client Port (PrCP) as the TCP or UDP source port.  These packets are
sent to an IP destination address called the Local Translator Address
(LTA) and a TCP or UDP destination port called the Local Translator
Port (LTP).  Note that the triple consisting of (PrCA, LTA, LTP) is
different for each Peer Address and Peer Port with which the Client
Application communicates.
</li>
<li>Since the NAT-XC Protocol is designed to permit use of a legacy
IPv4 NAT between the Client Host and the Translator, an IP packet sent
to a Translator by a Client Host may arrive at the Translator with a
different source address and port than the ones originally specified
by the Client Host.  The source address and port appearing in the
packet as it arrives at the translator are known as the Public
Client Address (PuCA) and Public Client Port (PuCP).  (The destination
address and port of IP packets sent to the Translator from the Client
Host must be the same as originated by the Client Host.)
</li>
<li>When a packet from a Client Host is received by the Translator, it
determines whether there is a Binding established for that
particular PuCA and PuCP and LTA and LTP.  If so, it will translate
the incoming IPvX packet into an IPvY packet that is originated
from a Remote Translator Address (RTA) and Remote Translator Port
(RTP) and sent to a Peer Address (PA) and Peer Port (PP).
</li>
</ul><p>

The path taken by a packet sent by the Peer Application to the Client
Application is similar.  It originates with source address PA and
source port PP, is sent to the Translator at destination address RTA
and destination port RTP.  The Translator then looks for a Binding
associated with RTA and RTP.  If it finds one, it translates the
packet into one with source address LTA and source port LTP, with
destination address PuCA and destination port PuCP.  (In the case
where the Client Application is listening for incoming traffic from
Peers for which there is no prior Binding, a new LTA and LTP will be
assigned for use with a new Peer, and a new Binding will be created
specifically for use with that Peer.)  The translated packet
will then be sent to the Client Host with destination address PrCA and
destination port PrCP.
<br />
<br />


The description above is not intended to forbid the use of
administrative controls on communication between endpoints.  If so
configured, the Translator may refuse to forward traffic between
particular endpoint addresses and ports, even when a Binding exists.

</p>
<p>
Note: the author's intention is to rewrite this document using the
concept of a "transport address" to avoid the need, in most cases, to
refer to an address and port.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Translator</h3>

<p>
A Translator may be located at any point which has both public IPv4
and public IPv6 network access.  One or more public IPv4 addresses and
one or more public IPv6 addresses will be routed to the Translator.
<br />
<br />


A Translator translates between IPv4 and IPv6 packets, in both
directions, according to Bindings which have been established.
A Binding associates the following with one another:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Transport Protocol (e.g. UDP, TCP)
</li>
<li>Public Client Address and Port (PuCA, PuCP)
</li>
<li>Local Translator Address and Port (LTA, LTP)
</li>
<li>Remote Translator Address and Port (RTA, RTP)
</li>
<li>Peer Address and Port (PA, PP)
</li>
</ul><p>

Note that an Address may either be an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.
The Public Client Address and the Local Translator Address associated
with a Binding must be in the same address realm.  Likewise, the
Remote Translator Address and the Peer Address must be in the same
address realm.  It is generally expected that the Local Translator
Address and the Remote Translator Address associated with a Binding
will be in different address realms.
<br />
<br />


In discussions of NAT-XC, "Client" refers to some party for whom access
to a remote address realm is needed.  A Translator may serve IPv4
clients (providing them with access to the public IPv6 network), IPv6
clients (providing them with access to the public IPv4 network), or
both.  It is possible for both ends of a conversation to be Clients of
the same Translator.
<br />
<br />


For each realm for which it provides services to clients, a Translator
has a Control Address and Port (CAP) to which Control Protocol
messages may be sent.  Note that a Translator may have more than one
CAP.  It is anticipated that a well-known address and port will be
requested from IANA for use with the NAT-XC Control Protocol as the
default CAP, as this will allow the use of NAT-XC without
site-specific configuration.  However, a Translator may accept Control
Protocol messages at any address and port at which it can receive
packets, and a Control Point may be explicitly configured to use a
particular CAP.  <br />
<br />


Unlike traditional NAT devices, the Translator does not act as the
default router for any address realm.  The Translator MAY appear to
the network as a router in either or both of the public IPv4 and
public IPv6 address realms, but packets sent to the Translator from
the Client Host or a Peer Host are sent directly to an IP address
assigned to the Translator.  Similarly, there is no "inside" or
"outside" to a NAT-XC Translator, nor even the notion of "sides" in
the definition of the Translator.  Client-originated traffic is
distinguished from Peer-originated traffic via the destination address
and port.  i.e. the Translator designates certain address and port
combinations to be used as the destination of Client-originated
traffic.  Packets arriving at these address and port combinations
which was not originated by a Client will not be translated or
forwarded.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Control Point</h3>

<p>
A Control Point is the point from which Bindings are requested and
managed.  Depending on circumstances, the Control Point may exist at a
variety of locations between the Client Application and the Translator.
Bindings are created and managed via a Control Protocol.  Binding
requests are sent by the Control Point to a Control Address and Port
(CAP) on the Translator.
<br />
<br />


The following examples illustrate different locations (i.e. Control
Points) from which Translator Bindings may be managed:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An Application may be explicitly coded to generate NAT-XC Control
Messages, or it may be statically linked to a library which
generates NAT-XC Control Messages as part of its implementation of
network access. In either case the Application is the Control Point.
</li>
<li>An Application may be bound at run time to a library which
generates NAT-XC Control Messages as part of its implementation of
network access, in which case the library may serve as the Control
Point for any application that calls it, and which does not manage its
own bindings.
(also known as "Bump in the API" or "BitA").
</li>
<li>Support for NAT-XC may be included in the network stack of the host
platform. In this case the network stack is the Control Point for any
application that uses it, and whose bindings are not managed either by
the application itself or by a library called by the application.
(also known as "Bump in the Stack" or "BitS").
</li>
<li>If there is no Control Point closer to the Client Application, a
Control Router located in the signal path between the Client Host and
the Translator may serve as the Control Point.  Unlike other kinds of
Control Points, the Control Router appears to the network as a router.
Such a Control Router infers bindings based on traffic analysis and
heuristics, in a manner similar to legacy NAT devices. (Such a Control
Router may also implement a DNS ALG or other ALGs to accommodate
IPv4-only hosts or applications not written to a dual stack model. The
Control Router configuration is thus considered a "last resort"
mechanism, and it should be used sparingly.)

(NB: I'm looking for a better name than Control Router for this.)
</li>
<li>For legacy "server" Applications in the "client-server" sense (that is,
Applications that accept inbound traffic) it is possible for a
separate process to manage one or more Bindings in the Translator so
that traffic sent to a particular Remote Translator Address and Port
will be forwarded to a Private Client Address and Port.  This allows
such "server" Applications to accept traffic from other address realms.
</li>
</ul><p>

It is possible for more than one of these mechanisms to be in place.
For instance, an Application which is NAT-XC aware may run on a
network stack which is also NAT-XC aware, and there may also be a
Control Router between that Host and the Translator.  In this case the
Control Point that is closest to the Client Application is the one
that controls the Bindings for that Application.
<br />
<br />


There are tradeoffs associated with different locations for Control
Points.  In particular, a Control Router arrangement requires explicit
configuration to establish a binding that listens for traffic from a
remote realm.  Also, a Control Router cannot easily distinguish
between traffic from dual-stack applications and IPv4-only
applications, and so it does not reliably know when to intercept
traffic using ALGs that compensate for such legacy applications. On
the other hand, the other mechanisms all require that some change be
made on each host supporting an application that wishes to communicate
across realm boundaries.  And a Control Router can be very useful for
accommodating an occasional legacy application, host, or network
appliance, as long as it is configured so as not to adversely affect
other network traffic.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Bindings and Translation</h3>

<p>
A Translator has one or more public IPv4 addresses routed to it, and
one or more public IPv6 addresses routed to it.  Each of those
addresses has potentially 2**16 TCP and 2**16 UDP ports which can be
used.  A Translator MAY be a host which performs other functions
and/or provides other services in addition to being a Translator.  If
so, some of the TCP and/or UDP ports may be reserved for other
purposes and not be available to the Translator.
<br />
<br />


Of the (transport protocol, address, port) combinations available to
the Translator, the Translator will mark some of them as for use by
Clients, and others for use by Peers.  (Other combinations may be
reserved and unavailable for either use).  Any (transport protocol,
address, port) combination currently used in a Binding must be marked
in such a way.  The designation of a (transport protocol, address,
port) combination as Client or Peer may not be changed while the
combination appears in any Binding.  <br />
<br />


The Translator maintains a set of Bindings which it uses to 
translate packets from one realm to another. A Binding is an 9-tuple
consisting of Transport Protocol (e.g. UDP or TCP), Public Client
Address and Port (PuCA, PuCP), Local Translator Address and Port (LTA,
LTP), Remote Translator Address and Port (RTA, RTP), and Peer Address
and Port (PA, PP).

The PA, PP, and LTP parameters of a Binding may be "wildcards" which
can match any address or port.  A Binding consisting of PA, PP, and
LTP which are "wildcards" is used to permit new inbound conversations
from potential Peers to a Client.  Normally when such a binding
exists, the Client Host will be "listening" for traffic at the PrCA
and PrCP corresponding to the PuCA and PuCP associated with that binding.
<br />
<br />


Other information (e.g. lease timeout, binding ID, client ID, access
permissions) may also be associated with the Binding, but the details
of these are implementation-specific.
<br />
<br />


For any Transport Protocol, there is at most one unique, one-to-one,
bidirectional mapping between a combination of client-side binding
parameters (PuCA, PuCP, LTA, LTP) and a combination of peer-side
binding parameters (RTA, RTP, PA, PP).
<br />
<br />


The Client Address and Peer Address SHOULD be from different realms -
e.g. either the Client Address IPv4 and the Peer Address is IPv6, or
vice versa.  The Public Client Address and the Local Translator
Address MUST be from the same realm.  Similarly, the Remote Translator
Address and Peer Address MUST be from the same realm.
<br />
<br />


NOTE: Translation between public IPv6 addresses is strongly
discouraged.  Use of this protocol to translate between public IPv4
and private IPv4, or between different private IPv4 realms, is for
further study. 
<br />
<br />


Translation between IPv4 and IPv6 is generally as defined
in <a class='info' href='#RFC2765'>SIIT<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E., &ldquo;Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2765],
except that address mapping is as follows:
<br />

When a packet arrives at the Translator, its
transport protocol, IP destination address, and transport protocol
destination port are inspected.

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the transport protocol is not supported, an appropriate ICMP (v4
or v6) Destination Unreachable message SHOULD be generated in response.
</li>
<li>If this (transport protocol, address, port) combination is marked
for use by Clients, the Translator searches for a Binding matching
the transport protocol and (PuCA = source address, PuCP = source
port, LTA = IP destination address, LTP = destination port) for the
incoming packet.
</li>
<li>If such a Binding is found, the inbound packet is translated to a
new packet with (source address = RTA, source port = RTP,
destination address = PA, destination port = RTP).
<br />
<br />


If no such Binding is found, an ICMP Destination Unreachable message
SHOULD be generated.
</li>
<li>If this (transport protocol, address, port) combination is marked
for use by Peers, the Translator searches for a Binding matching the
transport protocol and (RTA = destination address, RTP = destination
port, PA = source address, PP = source port).
<br />
<br />


If such a Binding is found, the inbound packet is translated to a
new packet with (source address = LTA, source port = LTP,
destination address = PuCA, destination port = PuCP).
<br />
<br />


If no such Binding is found, the Translator searches for a Binding
matching (RTA = destination address, RTP = destination port, PA =
"wildcard", PP = "wildcard").  If such a Binding is found, a new
Binding is created with the same PuCA, PuCP, LTA, RTA, and RTP as
the one matching the inbound packet.  The PA and PP of the new
binding are the source address and source port, respectively, from
the inbound packet.  The LTP of the new binding is chosen by the
translator from the set of available ports, subject to the
constraint that the (transport protocol, LTA, port) are marked for
Client use.  Finally, the inbound packet is translated according to
the newly created binding.
<br />
<br />


Note that whenever a new Binding is created, a Binding Information
message is sent to the Control Point.
</li>
</ul><p>

It is possible for both endpoints of a conversation to use the
same Translator at the same time, and thus, for the packet to need to
be translated twice.  It is therefore necessary for the Translator to
detect this case.  It is assumed that the right thing to do here is to
avoid translating the packet between IPv6 and IPv4 (and back again)
and instead, just translate the addresses without changing the packet
format.  This case needs further study.

Sending Requests</h3>

<p>
Communications between a Control Point and a Translator are
accomplished using different mechanisms depending on the nature of the
request. 
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A Control Channel may be established between a Control Point and a
  Translator's Control Address and Port (CAP).  The Control Channel
  uses <a class='info' href='#RFC5246'>TLS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5246] over TCP.  This channel is used
  to establish  credentials for the authentication of client requests
  sent over UDP,   for Binding Information messages sent from the
  Translator to the Control Point, and other purposes.  The Control
  Channel is not required to be maintained at all times, and Bindings
  MUST be maintained for the duration of their leases even if the
  Control Channel fails for some reason.
</li>
<li>However, due to the requirement that NAT-XC work when a legacy IPv4
  NAT exists between the Client Host and the Translator, Bind Request
  messages for UDP MUST be sent to a Translator's CAP via UDP from the
  PuCA and PuCP.  This is because the Translator must be able to
  establish the Binding in terms of the PrCA and PrCP, and these are
  only known by sending traffic through the legacy IPv4 NAT from the
  same transport protocol, Client source address, and port that will
  be used by later traffic between the Client and the Peer.
</li>
<li>In addition, when a Binding Request is issued for a new
  client-originated conversation by a Control Router, it is necessary for
  the new Binding to be established before the initial packet is
  translated.  For this reason, the Control Point MAY include a
  "piggybacked" packet to be translated onto a Binding Request or
  Renew Binding Request.  This facility SHOULD NOT be used by other
  kinds of Control Points.
<br />
<br />


  Discussion: There is a possibility that some kinds of middleware
  boxes (e.g. traffic filters) may block TCP connections unless they
  first see a SYN packet from the host initiating the SYN.  If, say, a
  NAT-XC aware TCP stack were to use piggybacking to send an initial SYN
  packet while establishing a Binding in the Translator, and the
  middleware box were placed between the host and the Translator, the
  middleware box would not see a SYN packet, and might disrupt
  subsequent traffic from the host.

Security</h3>

<p>
As details have obviously not been worked out, the main purpose of
this section is to explicitly acknowledge the necessity of designing
security into this protocol from day one.
<br />
<br />


There are many cases (perhaps all of them) where communications
between a Control Point and a Translator will need to be
authenticated, and perhaps encrypted.  At the moment, it is naively
assumed that TLS can be profiled to provide adequate
Translator-to-Control Point authentication and encryption for the
Control Channel.  Authentication by the Control Point to the
Translator, when needed, can be accomplished either using TLS client
certificates or a username/password like mechanism similar to that
used with TLS by several application protocols (e.g. POP, IMAP).
However, there is a conflict between the goal of providing zero
configuration for Control Points and providing the authentication
needed to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks over TLS.
<br />
<br />


For other communications between the Control Point and the Translator,
it is (again, naively) assumed that a symmetric encryption key
obtained via the Control Channel (and subject to renewal at intervals)
can be used to both authenticate and encrypt those communications, in
a manner similar to that used by Kerberos.

Framing of requests and responses sent using TCP and TLS over TCP</h3>

Protocol messages sent via UDP have an obvious framing - one request

framing in order to separate one protocol message from another.  For
now it is assumed that, when sent over TCP, each request or response
message can be prefixed by a 16-bit request or response length in

      The following attributes apply to CreateBindingRequest messages:
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>XOR-PRIVATE-CLIENT-ADDRESS.  This is used to convey the Private
	  Client Address and Port (PrCA, PrCP).  This attribute is REQUIRED
	  for CreateBindingRequest messages.
</li>
<li>XOR-REMOTE-ADDRESS.  This is used to convey the Remote
	  Translator Address and Port.  This attribute is REQUIRED.
	  However if either of the X-Address or X-Port fields of that
	  attribute are set to zero, the Translator may assign any
	  available address or port to that binding.
</li>
<li>XOR-PEER-ADDRESS.  This is used to convey the Peer Address
	  and Port to the Translator, for the case where the client
	  wishes to communicate with a specific peer.  If the
	  XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute is included in the CreateBinding
	  request, the Translator assigns a particular Local
	  Translator Address and Port for use when sending to the Peer
	  Address and Port provided by the Control Point, and the
	  Translator will include that Local Translator Address and
	  Port in the XOR-LOCAL-ADDRESS of the response.
	  <br />
<br />


	  If the XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute is omitted, it implies
	  that the Control Point is requesting a binding to permit any
	  peer to send unsolicited traffic to the Remote Translator
	  Address and Port assigned by the Translator.  If such a
	  CreateBinding request is honored, the Translator will
	  effectively create a new Binding any time it receives
	  traffic at the Remote Translator Address and Port from a new
	  Peer Address and/or Port.  The Binding will associate a
	  Local Translator Address and Port to be assigned by the
	  Translator, and the Public Client Address and Port from
	  which the CreateBinding request was received, with the Peer
	  Address and Port from which the new traffic was received.
	  Whenever such a Binding is created, a Binding Notification
	  message is sent to the Control Point.
</li>
<li>A XOR-PIGGYBACK-PACKET attribute MAY be included with a
	  Bind Request.  If the Bind Request is successful, this
	  packet will be translated and sent by the Translator just as
	  if it had been sent by the Client Host.  The source IP
	  address and source port of the PiggyBack Packet MUST be the
	  same as the PrCA and PrCP, and the destination IP address
	  and port of the PiggyBack Packet.  (The Translator MAY
	  accept the Bind Request while refusing to forward the
	  PiggyBack packet, in which case it will return a Status of
	  {TBD} in the CreateBinding Response message).
</li>
<li>REQUESTED-TTL.  This attribute is OPTIONAL.  If omitted,
	  the Translator will supply a default.
</li>
<li>A CREATE-BINDING-OPTIONS attribute MAY be included to
	  request specific binding options:

	  
<ul class="text">
<li>The DisableALG option is actually for use by Control
	      Routers.  A Control Router intercepts traffic sent to
	      the default CAP, processes it, and then forwards the
	      requests to the Translator.  This allows the Control
	      Router to act as an authentication proxy between the
	      Client and the Translator, but it also provides a means
	      by which applications can disable ALG behavior provided
	      by the Control Router.
</li>
<li>The DoubleNAT option affects the Bind Response and
	      Binding Information messages in the case where (a) two
	      endpoints are clients of the same Translator, and (b)
	      both endpoints are connected via a translated address.
	      If the DoubleNAT option is TRUE, the Bind Response and
	      Binding Information messages will reflect both layers of
	      address translation, even if the translation is v6 to v6
	      or v4 to v4.  If the DoubleNAT option is FALSE, the Bind
	      Response and Binding Information messages for that
	      Binding will only reflect a single layer of translation.
	      This is believed to be useful when implementing IPv4
	      socket APIs - so that for instance a getpeername() call
	      on a socket that is connected via the translator will
	      always produce an address of the expected address
	      family.

</ul>

      The CreateBindingResponse message contains the following attributes:

<li>XOR-REMOTE-ADDRESS.
</li>
<li>XOR-PEER-ADDRESS.
</li>
<li>CREATE-BINDING-RESPONSE-FLAGS.
	  
<ul class="text">
<li>The LegacyNATisPresent flag is set to 1 if the
	      Translator detects the presence of a Legacy NAT (i.e. if
	      the Public Client Address and/or Port are different from
	      the values in the XOR-PRIVATE-CLIENT-ADDRESS attribute
	      of the request).
</li>
<li>The ALGisPresent flag is set to 1 by a Control Router
	      (when forwarding a response to a client) if the Control

</li>
</ul>
	
</li>
<li>BINDING-ID.  The BindingID assigned to this Binding, for use in

</li>
<li>LEASE-ID.  The LeaseID assigned to this Binding, for use in

</li>
<li>LEASE-TTL.  The new TTL associated with this LeaseID.  Note

<br />
<br />


Note that this is of limited applicability for many kinds of Control

Keepalives</h3>

<p>
When communicating using UDP via a legacy IPv4 NAT, it may be necessary
to occasionally send traffic that will maintain the legacy IPv4 NAT's
binding, in a manner similar to that employed
by <a class='info' href='#RFC4380'>Teredo<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huitema, C., &ldquo;Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4380].  So in order to 
maintain the part of the communications path of a UDP conversation
between the Control Point, through the legacy IPv4 NAT, to the
Translator, it may be necessary to send UDP messages between the
PuCA,PuCP and LTA,LTP (in either direction) which are NOT translated or
forwarded to the Peer.  Similarly it may be necessary to send UDP
messages from the Translator through the legacy IPv4 NAT to the PuCA,
PuCP which are discarded before they reach the Client Application.
There needs to be some way to construct a UDP packet which will appear
normal to the legacy NAT and be passed through it, but which the
Translator can recognize as a packet that should not be forwarded. It is
assumed that IP options will not work for this purpose.
<br />
<br />


One way to do this might be for the Control Point and Translator to
choose a random number of sufficient length to be very unlikely to
appear in a conversation.  Any UDP packet of exactly that length,
containing exactly that random number, would be discarded.
<br />
<br />


This needs further study.

Application Control Over Bindings</h3>

<p>
A NAT-XC aware application may explicitly control its own bindings.
This is done by generating NAT-XC protocol messages and sending them
to the NAT-XC Translator.  For example, an application running on an
IPv4-only network (or on an IPv4-only host) may still access IPv6 via
a NAT-XC Translator.  To establish a TCP connection to an IPv6 host,
the application would:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Establish a TCP over IPv4 connection to the Translator's Control Address
  and Port (CAP).  Any available source IP address and port can be
  used, but the application needs to know what they are.
</li>
<li>Authenticate to the Translator (if required).  If Authentication is
  required the application will need to have been supplied with 
  authentication credentials.
</li>
<li>Request a Binding between the source IPv4 address and TCP port
  used by the application, and the desired Peer IPv6 address and TCP
  port.
</li>
<li>Read the Bind Response message from the Translator to determine
  whether the Bind Request was honored.
</li>
<li>If the Bind Request was honored, note the BindingID and LeaseTTL
  associated with the binding, and arrange for the lease to be renewed
  as necessary when the TTL expires.
</li>
<li>Establish a new TCP over IPv4 connection from the same source IPv4
  address and Port as before, but with a destination IPv4 address and
  port as returned in the Bind Response issued by the Translator.  At
  this point there is a connection between the local host (using
  IPv4) and the remote peer (using IPv6).
</li>
<li>Once the binding is no longer needed, free it up by issuing a
  Delete Binding request.
</li>
</ul><p>
Similarly, to listen for inbound IPv6 connections, the application
would:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Arrange to listen for incoming connections on a TCP socket with a
  known IPv4 address and TCP port.
</li>
<li>Establish a TCP over IPv4 connection to the CAP, using the same
  IPv4 source address and port as is being listened to.
</li>
<li>Request a Binding between that source address and port, and a
  Translator IPv6 address and port of the application's choosing.
  Either the address or port can be specified to be a wildcard, in
  which case the Translator is free to choose them. 
</li>
<li>Read the Bind Response message to determine whether the Bind
  Request was successful.
</li>
<li>Arrange for the Binding to be renewed when its TTL expires, for as
  long as necessary.
</li>
<li>At this point the application will be able to receive inbound IPv6
  traffic that is sent to the Translator address and port assigned to
  it.  This traffic will be translated and forwarded to the IPv4
  address and port on which the application is listening.
</li>
<li>When the Binding is no longer needed, free it up by issuing a
  Delete Binding request.
</li>
</ul><p>
While few applications are expected to need to control their own
bindings, this technique does have some interesting advantages.  For
instance, it allows an application to communicate with IPv6 peers even
if the local host or network do not support IPv6.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Control Point implemented in a Network Library</h3>

<p>
One way to manage NAT-XC bindings is to provide a Library which implements
the platform's usual network API.  The library would issue NAT-XC requests
as necessary to provide the application with the appearance of having
access to both the native IPv4 and native IPv6 networks.
<br />
<br />

There are two ways to implement such a library.  One is to provide a
"dual stack" API which makes both IPv4 and IPv6 visible to the
application as separate networks, even if the underlying host stack or
network only supported one of those.  With such an library, the
application would be able to lookup IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in DNS,
request IPv4 or IPv6 connections, etc. using normal API calls. The
library would make "real" system calls and invoke the translator as
necessary to provide the application with the appearance of having
access to both networks.
<br />
<br />

The other way to implement such a library is to map all IPv6 traffic
onto IPv4.  This would be used to allow an app written to an IPv4-only
programming model to exchange traffic with IPv6 peers. In this case
several of the usual "tricks" would be needed to provide the application
with the illusion that IPv6-only hosts had IPv4 addresses - DNS ALG to
return fake IPv4 addresses for hosts with only AAAA records.  An
additional layer of address mapping within the library (in addition to
that provided by the Translator) would be needed to make this work.
All of the usual caveats associated with NAT-PT and similar schemes
apply here. 
<br />
<br />

A single library could implement both programming models, but would
need external configuration (say via an environment variable) to let
it know whether to provide a dual stack programming model or an
IPv4-only programming model.  The dual stack model should be the default.
<br />
<br />

It is possible that a NAT-XC aware application might be used with a
NAT-XC aware library.   There are two cases for this.  One is when the
application wishes to completely manage all of its Bindings by itself
and to not have the library get in the way.  It is useful if such an
application has a way to "turn off" the library so that networking API
calls are handled transparently.  One "natural" way to 
do this might be for the library to recognize if the application
establishes a TCP connection with the Translator's CAP.  This works as
long as the library's idea of the Translator's address is the same as
the application's idea of the address.  A less natural way would be
for the application to be able to set an environment variable which
could then be recognized by the library to mean "don't intercept
networking system calls and let the application manage its own bindings".
<br />
<br />

The other case is when the application is willing to let the library
do the work of maintaining the bindings, but it wants to have
visibility into the bindings, lease times, etc. that are being
maintained by the library.  Such an application might also want to
adjust lease times, disable ALGs, etc.  For this case it is useful if
the library provides additional API calls to give it that visibility.
For example, on UNIX, the ioctl(), setsockopt() or getsockopt()
functions might be overloaded to allow the application to find out
binding information for network sockets.   Overloading an existing API
function would allow applications to link to that function without the
potential of an unresolved symbol error.  The application could
determine at runtime whether the additional functionality were
supported.

Use of ALGs - and avoiding unnecessary ALGs</h3>

<p>
It is hoped that in most cases Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) will
not be needed.  In particular, since NAT-XC can often provide an
application with the appearance of direct access to both public IPv4 and
public IPv6 networks, the application can know its public addresses
(RTA, RTP) and its peer addresses (PA, PP) via the normal API calls
(e.g. getlocalname, getpeername).  Address referrals, IP address
logging, etc., should work fine.  In addition, source IP addresses may
still be used for access control, but this requires that trust be
extended to the Translator and to the entire communications path
between the Control Point and the Translator.
<br />
<br />

However, ALGs will still be needed for some applications, especially
those written for an IPv4-only programming model.  ALGs MAY therefore be
provided at the Control Point.  But since ALGs can actually interfere with
the operation of applications that don't need them, it is necessary to
provide means to explicitly enable and disable them.  For Control
Points which implement ALGs, a default setting of "ALGs disabled" is
strongly encouraged.  In addition, an application may disable ALGs
implemented downstream by issuing a Bind request with the disableALGs
option set to TRUE.

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>For the case of apps that are explicitly aware of NAT-XC and interact
directly with the Translator, ALGs should not be an issue.  However,
an ALG in a downstream Control Router might still interfere with
traffic.  For instance an FTP ALG would change the addresses in PORT
commands, whereas a DNS ALG would alter the nature of DNS queries and
return results different than provided by the queried server.  While
Control Routers SHOULD NOT enable ALGs except for hosts known to need
them, the only way that an application can be sure that a Control
Router will not apply an ALG is to issue a Bind request with the
disableALGs flag set to TRUE.
</li>
<li>For the case of Control Points implemented on the Client Host (BitA,
BitS), it SHOULD be possible to explicitly configure whether any
particular ALGs can be enabled. Ideally this would be done on a
per-application basis.  This could be done, say, by setting an
environment variable when launching the application, or by marking the
application in a particular way that could be recognized by the
Control Point.
</li>
<li>There is potential for an ALG implemented in a Control Router to
interfere with an application.  For instance, a DNS ALG implemented in
a Control Router can provide incorrect and misleading results for a
dual-stack app.  Furthermore a Control Router cannot reliably
distinguish between different applications' traffic nor determine
which applications need ALGs and which do not.
<br />
<br />

A Control Router that implements ALGs SHOULD have them disabled by
default, and SHOULD be configurable to enable them on a per-host
basis. For instance, it should be possible to enable ALGs for an
IPv4-only host and have them be disabled for dual-stack hosts.
(It is possible to imagine a small Control Router, designed for use only
with a single host, with a switch to turn ALGs needed by v4-only apps
either "on" or "off".  That would at least allow control of ALGs on a
per-host basis.) 
<br />
<br />

However, because per-host configuration can be wrong, and because
different applications on the same host may be affected differently
by ALGs, it seems necessary to provide a mechanism by which upstream
Control Points can disable or bypass ALGs implemented in Control
Routers on a per-application basis.

Inspiration and Related Work</h3>

<p>
Ideas for NAT-XC came from various places.  
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
<a class='info' href='#RFC1928'>SOCKS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Leech, M., Ganis, M., Lee, Y., Kuris, R., Koblas, D., and L. Jones, &ldquo;SOCKS Protocol Version 5,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1928] is a mechanism that was originally
designed to permit IPv4 access over a serial line to hosts lacking a
network connection.  It was later adapted as a means to establish
communications through a firewall.
</li>
<li>The author designed a general purpose NAT traversal solution for
the NetSolve distributed computing project, which used connection
forwarding and was similar to TRT.  Like NAT-XC, the NetSolve
mechanism was designed to be usable with minimal changes to existing
code.

<li><a class='info' href='#RFC3103'>RSIP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Borella, M., Grabelsky, D., Lo, J., and K. Taniguchi, &ldquo;Realm Specific IP: Protocol Specification,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3103] is a mechanism for providing access
to the public IPv4 realm from within a private IPv4 realm.  NAT-XC
is similar, but because IPv4 and IPv6 use different packet formats
with different sized addresses, because the two kinds of addresses
are separate spaces which do not overlap, and because many
applications nowdays are written to handle the two different kinds
of addresses explicitly, many of the limitations associated with
RSIP do not appear to impact NAT-XC.

Use cases</h3>

<p>
NAT-XC can be used to facilitate access across IPv4/IPv6 realm
boundaries in a variety of cases.  Note that the inability of an
application to communicate with both IPv4 and IPv6 peers can be due to
any of several different factors: 
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The application may be written only to an IPv4 programming model,
</li>
<li>The host may lack either an IPv4 or an IPv6 stack, 
</li>
<li>The local network may lack support for either IPv4 or IPv6, 
</li>
<li>The local network may not provide routing to both the public IPv4 and
  IPv6 networks, or
</li>
<li>The local network may be behind a legacy IPv4 NAT and use private 
  IPv4 addressing.
</li>
</ul><p>
NAT-XC was designed to permit cross-realm communications in all of the
cases above.  e.g.:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Public IPv4 access from an IPv6-only network.
</li>
<li>Public IPv6 access from an IPv4-only network.  (6to4 and Teredo 
  address this problem in a different way, via tunneling rather than
  address/packet translation.)
</li>
<li>Dual Stack application operating on IPv4-only host, needing access to IPv6.
</li>
<li>Dual Stack application operating on IPv6-only host, needing access to
  IPv4.  (assumed to be rare)
</li>
<li>IPv4-only application talking with public IPv6 hosts.  (DNS ALG and
  perhaps other ALGs required.)
</li>
<li>Applications explicitly aware of NAT-XC.
</li>
</ul><p>

"How do I get my applications working across IPv4/IPv6 boundaries?"</h3>

<p>
This section is intended to illustrate the ways in which ANY of various
parties can act to use NAT-XC to ease IPv4/IPv6 transition,
independently of one another.  This is a contrast to the traditional
IPv6 transition model where multiple parties (user, server operator,
network operator, ISPs) ALL have to act to provide IPv6 access.
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If you are the developer of an application, you can:

<ul class="text">
<li>modify your application to explicitly support NAT-XC (if provided by
    the customer), or
</li>
<li>relink your application with a library that intercepts network API
    calls and makes use of NAT-XC (if provided by the customer), or
</li>
<li>if your application is dynamically linked (i.e. it makes use of a
    separate library that is loaded at run time to implement network
    access), you can ship a library that is compatible with NAT-XC as a
    replacement for the previous one.
</li>
</ul>

You can even (if you wish) provide a NAT-XC Translator for use by your
customers.
</li>
<li>If you are a server operator, you can:

<ul class="text">
<li>update your servers' operating systems to support NAT-XC, or
</li>
<li>for dynamically linked applications, install a NAT-XC aware
    networked library on your servers.
</li>
</ul>

You have the option of providing your own NAT-XC Translator or making
arrangements with a third party to provide that service.
</li>
<li>If you are a network operator, you can


<ul class="text">
<li>make arrangements for your network to have a NAT-XC Translator
    (either by installing one, or by arrangement with your ISP, or
    by making arrangement with a third-party Translator and tunneling
    Control Protocol traffic to that Translator.), and
</li>
<li>optionally, install a Control Router
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>If you are an ordinary personal computer user, you can

<ul class="text">
<li>upgrade your operating system to support NAT-XC, or
</li>
<li>install a NAT-XC aware dynamic library, or
</li>
<li>upgrade your software to versions that explicitly support
  NAT-XC, or
</li>
<li>install a NAT-XC Control Router between your computer and the

  third-party Translator.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Security considerations are still being determined.  The following
  issues have been identified.  
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>There is a need for the Translator to be able to require
  authentication, and to impose access controls on Bindings,
  especially when the Translator is not provided by the
  enterprise network or that network's ISP.
</li>
<li>There is a need to provide encryption for the Control Protocol.
</li>
<li>NAT-XC provides the capability of individual hosts and applications to
  source traffic from addresses outside the enterprise network and
  receive traffic sent to addresses to outside the enterprise
  network. In some cases network operators will want to prevent, or
  control, such traffic - and in some cases they have a legitimate
  interest in doing so.  This tussle needs to be addressed explicitly
  in the document.
</li>
<li>More generally, NAT-XC impacts any network that analyzes or filters
  traffic based on IP address.  Locally-provided Translators may log,
  analyze, or filter traffic based on local policies, and networks MAY
  attempt to block connections to external Translators.  However the
  Control Channel is encrypted, and nothing prevents an application
  and an external Translator from agreeing to use a different port for
  Control Channels.  Also, there is no reliable mechanism for
  distinguishing between Control Channel traffic and other traffic
  that might be sent over TLS.

</li>
<li>Applications using IP source addresses as authentication tokens,
  will be extending trust to the Translator and to the entire signal
  path between the Application and the Translator.  Especially when
  the Translator is located on an external network, this may
  introduce new opportunities for source address spoofing.
</li>
</ul><p>

IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>
This document is a long way from being a formal protocol
specification, much less a published one.  However in the event that
this protocol were ever standardized or approved on an experimental
basis, IANA would be requested to assign a well-known port for use
with NAT-XC, and to assign an IP address which could be used as a
default address for use with NAT-XC.
