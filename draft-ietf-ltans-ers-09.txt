Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   In many application areas of electronic data exchange, a non-
   repudiable proof of the existence of digital data must be possible.
   In some cases, this proof must survive the passage of long periods of
   time.  An important example is digitally signed data.  Digital
   signatures can be used to demonstrate data integrity and to perform
   source authentication.  In some cases, digitally signed data must be
   archived for 30 years or more.  However, the reliability of digital
   signatures over long periods is not absolute.  During the archival
   period, hash algorithms and public key algorithms can become weak or
   certificates can become invalid.  These events complicate the
   reliance on digitally signed data after many years by increasing the
   liklihood that forgeries can be created.  To avoid losing the desired
   security properties derived from digital signatures, it is necessary
   to prove that the digitally signed data already existed before such a
   critical event.  This can be accomplished using a timestamp.
   However, some timestamps rely upon mechanims that will be subject to
   the same problems.  To counter this problem, timestamps are renewed
   by simply obtaining a new timestamp that covers the original data and
   its timestamps prior to the compromise of mechanisms used to generate
   the timestamps.  This document provides a syntax to support the
   periodic renewal of timestamps.

   It is necessary to standardize the data formats and processing
   procedures for such timestamps in order to be able to verify and
   communicate preservation evidence.  A first approach was made by IETF
   within [RFC3126], where an optional Archive Timestamp Attribute was
   specified for integration in signatures according to the
   Cryptographic Messages Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852].

   Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) broadens and generalizes this approach
   for data of any format and takes long-term archive service
   requirements [I-D.ietf-ltans-reqs] into account, in particular, the
   handling of large sets of data objects.  ERS specifies a syntax for
   an EvidenceRecord, which contains a set of Archive Timestamps and
   some additional data.  This Evidence Record can be stored separate
   from the archived data, as a file, or integrated into the archived
   data, i.e., as an attribute.  ERS also specifies processes for
   generation and verification of Evidence Records.  Appendix A
   describes the integration and use of an EvidenceRecord in context of
   signed and enveloped messages according to the Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS).  ERS does not specify a protocol for interacting with a
   long-term archive system.  The Long-term Archive Protocol
   specification [[I-D.ietf-ltans-ltap]] addresses this interface.

1.2.  General Overview and Requirements

   ERS meets requirements for data structures set forth in
   [I-D.ietf-ltans-reqs].

   The basis of the ERS are Archive Timestamps, which can cover a single
   data object (as an RFC3161 compliant timestamp does) or can cover a
   group of data objects.  Groups of data objects are addressed using
   hash-trees, first described by Merkle [MER1980], combined with a
   timestamp.  The leaves of the hash-tree are hash values of the data
   objects in a group.  A timestamp is requested only for the root hash
   of the hash-tree.  The deletion of a data object in the tree does not
   influence the provability of others.  For any particular data object,
   the hash-tree can be reduced to a few sets of hash values, which are
   sufficient to prove the existence of a single data object.
   Similarly, the hash tree can be reduced to prove existence of a data
   group, provided all members of the data group have the same parent
   node in the hash tree.  Archive Timestamps are comprised of an
   optional reduced hash tree and a timestamp.

   An EvidenceRecord may contain many Archive Timestamps.  For the
   generation of the initial Archive Timestamp, the data objects to be
   timestamped have to be determined.  Depending on the context, this
   could be a file or a data object group consisting of multiple files,
   such as a document and its associated digital signature.

   Before the cryptographic algorithms used within the Archive Timestamp
   become weak or timestamp certificates become invalid, Archive
   Timestamps have to be renewed by generating a new Archive Timestamp.
   ERS distinguishes two ways for renewal of an Archive Timestamp:
   Timestamp Renewal and Hash-Tree Renewal.

   In the case of Timestamp Renewal, the timestamp of an Archive
   Timestamp has to be hashed and timestamped by a new Archive
   Timestamp.  This mode of renewal can only be used when it is not
   necessary to access the archived data objects covered by the
   timestamp.  For example, this simple form of renewal is sufficient if
   the public key algorithm of the timestamp is going to lose its
   security or the timestamp authority certificate is about to expire.
   This is very efficient, in particular, if Archive Timestamping is
   done by an archiving system or service, which implements a central
   management of Archive Timestamps.

   Timestamp renewal is not sufficient if the hash algorithm used to
   build the hash-tree of an Archive Timestamp becomes insecure.  In the
   case of Hash-Tree Renewal, all evidence data must be accessed and
   timestamped.  This includes not only the timestamps but also the
   complete Archive Timestamps and the archived data objects covered by



Gondrom, et al.           Expires July 8, 2007                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


   the timestamps, which must be hashed and timestamped again by a new
   Archive Timestamp.

1.3.  Terminology

      Archived data object: Data unit that is archived and has to be
      preserved for a long time by the Long-term Archive Service.

      Archived data object group: A multitude of data objects, which for
      some reason belong together.  E.g. a document file and a signature
      file could be a archived data object group, which represent signed
      data.

      Archive Timestamp: Is a timestamp and lists of hash values, which
      allows to verify the existence of several data objects at a
      certain time.

      Archive Timestamp Chain: Part of a Archive Timestamp Sequence, it
      is a time-ordered sequence of Archive Timestamps, where each
      Archive Timestamp preserves non-repudiation of the previous
      Archive Timestamp, even after the previous Archive Timestamp
      becomes invalid.  Overall non-repudiation is maintained until the
      new Archive Timestamp itself becomes invalid.  The process of
      generating such an Archive Timestamp Chain is called Timestamp
      Renewal.

      Archive Timestamp Sequence: Part of the Evidence Record, it is a
      sequence of Archive Timestamp Chains, where each Archive Timestamp
      Chain preserves non-repudiation of the previous Archive Timestamp
      Chains, even after the hash algorithm used within the previous
      Archive Timestamps hash-tree became weak.  Non-repudiation is
      preserved until the last Archive Timestamp of the last chain
      becomes invalid.  The process of generating such an Archive
      Timestamp Sequence is called Hash-Tree Renewal.

      Evidence: Information that may be used to resolve a dispute about
      various aspects of authenticity of archived data objects.

      Evidence record: Collection of evidence compiled for one or more
      given archived data objects over time.  An evidence record
      includes all Archive Timestamps (within structures of Archive
      Timestamp Chains and Archive Timestamp Sequences) and additional
      verification data, like certificates, revocation information,
      trust anchors, policy details, role information, etc.

      Long-term Archive Service(LTA): A service responsible for
      preserving data for long periods of time, including generation and
      collection of evidence, storage of archived data objects and

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


      evidence, etc.

      Reduced hash-tree: The process of reducing a Merkle hash-tree
      [MER1980] to a list of lists of hash values.  This is the basis of
      storing the evidence for a single data object.

      Timestamp: A cryptographically secure confirmation generated by a
      Time Stamping Authority (TSA) [RFC3161] specifies a structure for
      timestamps and a protocol for communicating with a Time-stamp
      Authority (TSA).  Besides this, other data structures and
      protocols may also be appropriate, e.q., such as defined in
      [ISO-18014-1.2002], [ISO-18014-2.2002], [ISO-18014-3.2004], and
      [ANSI.X9-95.2005].

   An Archive Timestamp relates to a data object, if the hash value of
   this data object is part of the first hash value list of the Archive
   Timestamp.  An Archive Timestamp relates to a data object group, if
   it relates to every data object of the group and no other data
   objects.  An Archive Timestamp Chain relates to a data object / data
   object group, if its first Archive Timestamp relates to this data
   object/data object group.  An Archive Timestamp Sequence relates to a
   data object / data object group, if its first Archive Timestamp Chain
   relates to this data object/data object group.

3.  Evidence Record

   An Evidence Record is a unit of data, which can be used to prove the
   existence of an archived data object or an archived data object group
   at a certain time.  The Evidence Record contains Archive Timestamps,
   generated during a long archival period and possibly useful data for



Gondrom, et al.           Expires July 8, 2007                  [Page 7]

   validation.  It is possible to store this Evidence Record separately
   from the archived data objects or to integrate it into the data
   itself.  For data types signed data and enveloped data of the CMS
   integration is specified in Appendix A.

3.1.  Syntax

   Evidence Record has the following ASN.1 Syntax:

   ASN.1 Evidence Record

   EvidenceRecord ::= SEQUENCE {
      version                   INTEGER { v1(1) } ,
      digestAlgorithms          SEQUENCE OF AlgorithmIdentifier,

      cryptoInfos               [0] CryptoInfos OPTIONAL,
      encryptionInfo            [1] EncryptionInfo OPTIONAL,
      archiveTimeStampSequence  ArchiveTimeStampSequence,
      ...
      }

   CRYPT-INFO-CLASS ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

   CryptoInfos ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
         INSTANCE OF CRYPT-INFO-CLASS


   The fields have the following meanings:

   The 'version' field indicates the syntax version, for compatibility
   with future revisions of this specification and to distinguish it
   from earlier non-conformant or proprietary versions of the ERS.  The
   value 1 indicates this specification.  Lower values indicate an
   earlier version of the ERS has been used.  An implementation
   conforming to this specification SHOULD reject a version value below
   1.

   digestAlgorithms is a sequence of all the hash algorithms used to
   hash the data object over the archival period.  It is the union of
   all digestAlgorithm values from the ArchiveTimestamps contained in
   the EvidenceRecord.

   cryptoInfos allows the storage of data useful in the validation of
   the archiveTimeStampSequence.  This could include possible Trust
   Anchors, certificates, revocation information or the current
   definition of the suitability of cryptographic algorithms, past and
   present (e.g.  RSA 768bit valid until 1998, RSA 1024bit valid until
   2008, SHA1 valid until 2010).  These items may be added based on the



Gondrom, et al.           Expires July 8, 2007                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


   policy used.  Since this data is not protected within any timestamp,
   the data should be verifiable through other mechanisms.  Such
   verification is out-of-scope of this document.

   encryptionInfo contains the necessary information to enable encrypted
   content to be handled.  For discussion of syntax please refer to
   chapter 5.1

   ArchiveTimeStampSequence is a sequence of ArchiveTimeStampChain,
   described in chapter Section 5.

   If the archive data objects were encrypted before generating Archive
   Timestamps but a non-repudiation proof is needed for unencrypted data
   objects, the optional encryptionInfo field contains data necessary to
   unambiguously re-encrypt data objects.  If omitted, it means that
   data objects are not encrypted or that a non-repudiation proof for
   the unencrypted data is not required.  For further details see
   section Section 6.

3.2.  Generation

   The generation of an EvidenceRecord can be described as follows:

   1.  Select a data object or group of data objects to archive.

   2.  Create the Initial Archive Timestamp (see Archive Timestamp
       chapter Section 4).

   3.  Refresh the Archive Timestamp when necessary, by Timestamp
       Renewal or Hash-Tree Renewal (see chapter Section 5).

   The process of generation depends on whether the Archive Timestamps
   are generated, stored and managed by a centralized instance.  In the
   case of central management, it is possible to collect many data
   objects, build hash-trees, store them and reduce them later.  In case
   of local generation it might be easier to generate a simple Archive
   Timestamp without building hash-trees.  This can be accomplished by
   omitting the reducedHashtree field from the ArchiveTimestamp.  In
   this case, the ArchiveTimestamp covers a single data object.  Using
   this approach, it is possible to "convert" existing timestamps into
   ArchiveTimestamps for renewal.

3.3.  Verification

   The Verification of an EvidenceRecord overall can be described as
   follows:

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


   1.  Select an archived data object or group of data objects

   2.  Re-encrypt data object/data object group, if encryption field is
       used (details see chapter 5)

   3.  Verify Archive Timestamp Sequence (details in chapters Section 4
       and Section 5).


4.  Archive Timestamp

   An Archive Timestamp is a timestamp and a set of lists of hash
   values.  The lists of hash values are generated by reduction of an
   ordered Merkle hash-tree [MER1980].  The leaves of this hash-tree are
   the hash values of the data objects to be timestamped.  Every inner
   node of the tree contains one hash value, which is generated by
   hashing the concatenation of the children nodes.  The root hash
   value, which represents unambiguously all data objects, is
   timestamped.

4.1.  Syntax

   An Archive Timestamp has the following ASN.1 Syntax:

   ASN.1 Archive Timestamp

   ArchiveTimeStamp ::= SEQUENCE {
     digestAlgorithm [0] AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,
     reducedHashtree [1] SEQUENCE OF PartialHashtree OPTIONAL,
     timeStamp       ContentInfo}

   PartialHashtree ::= SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING


   The fields of type ArchiveTimeStamp have the following meanings:

   digestAlgorithm identifies the digest algorithm and any associated
   parameters used within the reduced hash-tree.  If the optional field
   digestAlgorithm is not present, the digest algorithm of the timestamp
   must be used.  If timestamps according to [RFC3161] are used, the
   content of this field must be identical to hashAlgorithm of
   messageImprint field of TSTInfo.

   reducedHashtree contains lists of hash values, organized in
   PartialHashtrees for easier understanding.  They can be derived by
   reducing a hash-tree to the nodes necessary to verify a single data
   object.  Hash values are represented as octet strings.  If the
   optional field reducedHashtree is not present, the ArchiveTimestamp

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


   simply contains an ordinary timestamp.

   timeStamp should contain the timestamp as defined in section
   Section 1.3. (e.g. as defined with TimeStampToken in [RFC3161]).
   Other types of timestamp MAY be used, if they contain time data,
   timestamped data and a cryptographically secure confirmation from the
   TSA of these data.

4.2.  Generation

   The lists of hash values of an Archive Timestamp can be generated by
   building and reducing a Merkle hash-tree [MER1980].

   Such a hash-tree can be built as follows:

   1.  Collect data objects to be timestamped.

   2.  Choose a secure hash algorithm H and generate hash values for the
       data objects.  These values will be the leaves of the hash-tree.

   3.  For each data group containing more than one document, its
       respective document hashes are binary sorted in ascending order,
       concatenated and hashed.  The hash values are the complete output
       from the hash algorithm, i.e., leading zeros are not removed,
       with the most significant bit first.

   4.  If there is more than one hash value, place them in groups and
       sort each group in binary ascending order.  Concatenate these
       values and generate new hash values, which are inner nodes of
       this tree.  (If additional hash values are needed, e.g. so that
       all nodes have the same number of children, any data may be
       hashed using H and used.)  Repeat this step until there is only
       one hash value, which is the root node of the hash-tree.

   5.  Order a timestamp for this root hash value.  The hash algorithm
       in the timestamp request must be the same as the hash algorithm
       of the hash-tree.

   An example of a constructed hash-tree for 3 data groups, where data
   group 1 and 3 only contain one document, and data group 2 contains 3
   documents:

   Figure 1: Hash-tree

     h1 = H(d1) where d1 is the only data object in data group 1
     h3 = H(d3) where d3 is the only data object in data group 3
     h12 = H( binary sorted and concatenated (h1, h2abc))

     h2c = H(third data object of data object group 2)
     h2abc = H( binary sorted and concatenated (h2a, h2b, h2c))

   The hash-tree can be reduced to lists of hash values, necessary to
   have a proof of existence for a single data object:

   1.  Generate hash value h of the data object, using hash algorithm H
       of the hash-tree.

   2.  Select all hash values, which have the same father node as h.
       Generate the first list of hash values by arranging these hashes,
       in binary ascending order.  This will be stored in the structure
       of the the PartialHashtree.  Repeat this step for the father node
       of all hashes until the root hash is reached.  The father nodes
       themselves are not saved in the hash lists - they are computable.

   3.  The list of all partialHashtrees finally is the reducedHashtree.
       (All of the specified hash values under the same father node
       except the father node of the nodes below are grouped in a

       PartialHashtree.  The sequence list of all Partialhashtrees is
       the reducedHashtree.)

   4.  Finally add the timestamp and the info about the hash algorithm
       to get an Archive Timestamp.

   Assuming that the sorted binary ordering of the hashes in Figure 1
   is: h2abc < h1 then the reduced hash-tree for data group 1 (d1) is:

    +--------------------------------+
    | +----------------+  +--------+ |
    | | +------+  +----+  | | +----+ |
    | | | h2abc|  | h1 |  | | | h3 | |

      The pseudo ASN1 for this reduced hash-tree rht1 would look like:

      with the PartialHashtrees pht1 and pht2
        pht1 = SEQ (h2abc, h1)
        pht2 = SEQ (h3)

   Assuming the same hash-tree as in figure 1 the reduced hash-tree for

   Note, there are no restrictions to the quantity of hash value lists

   and of their length.  Also note, that it is profitable but not
   required to build hash-trees and reduce them.  An Archive Timestamp
   may consist only of one list of hash-values and a timestamp or only a
   timestamp with no hash value lists.

   The data (e.g. certificates, CRLS or OCSP-Responses) needed to verify
   the timestamp SHOULD be stored in the timestamp itself or MUST be
   preserved otherwise.  A timestamp according to [RFC3161] is a CMS-
   object in which certificates can be stored in the certificates field
   and CRLs can be stored in the crls field of signed data.  OCSP
   responses can be stored as unsigned attributes [RFC3126].  Note
   [ANSI.X9-95.2005], [ISO-18014-2.2002] and [ISO-18014-3.2004] which
   specify verifiable timestamps that do not depend on certificates,
   CRLS, or OCSP-Responses.

4.3.  Verification

   An Archive Timestamp shall prove that a data object existed at a
   certain time, given by timestamp.  This can be verified as follows:

   1.  Calculate hash value h of the data object with hash algorithm H
       given in field digestAlgorithm of the Archive Timestamp.

   2.  Search for hash value h in the first list (partialHashtree) of
       reducedHashtree.  If not present, terminate verification process
       with negative result.

   3.  Concatenate the hash values of the actual list (partialHashtree)
       of hash values in binary ascending order and calculate the hash
       value h' with algorithm H. This hash value h' must become member
       of the next higher list of hash values (from the next
       partialHashtree).  Continue step 3 until a root hash value is
       calculated.

   4.  Check timestamp.  In case of timestamp according to [RFC3161] the
       root hash value must correspond to hashedMessage and
       digestAlgorithm must correspond to hashAlgorithm field, both in
       messageImprint field of timeStampToken.

   If a proof is necessary for more than one data object, steps 1 and 2
   have to be done for all data objects to be proved.  If an additional
   proof is necessary that the Archive Timestamp relates to a data
   object group (e.g. a document and all its signatures) it can be
   verified additionally, that only the hash values of the given data
   objects are in the first hash value list.

5.  Archive Timestamp Chain and Archive Timestamp Sequence

   Archive Timestamps are used for archive timestamping.  An Archive
   Timestamp proves the existence of single data objects or data object
   group at a certain time.  However, this first Archive Timestamp in
   the first ArchiveTimeStampChain can become invalid, if hash
   algorithms or public key algorithms used in its hash-tree or
   timestamp become weak or if the validity period of the timestamp
   authority certificate expires or is revoked.

   Prior to such an event, the existence of the Archive Timestamp or
   archive timestamped data has to be reassured.  This can be done by
   creating a new Archive Timestamp.  Depending on whether the timestamp
   becomes invalid or the hash algorithm of the hash-tree becomes weak,
   two kinds of Archive Timestamp renewal are possible:

   o  Timestamp Renewal: A new Archive Timestamp is generated, which
      covers the timestamp of the old one.  One or more Archive
      Timestamps generated by Timestamp Renewal yield an Archive
      Timestamp Chain for a data object or data object group.

   o  Hash-Tree Renewal: A new Archive Timestamp is generated, which
      covers all the old Archive Timestamps as well as the data objects.
      A new Archive Timestamp Chain is started.  One or more Archive
      Timestamp Chains for a data object or data object group yield an
      Archive Timestamp Sequence.

5.1.  Syntax

   ArchiveTimeStampChain and ArchiveTimeStampSequence have the following
   ASN.1 Syntax:

   ASN.1 ArchiveTimeStampChain and -Sequence

   ArchiveTimeStampChain    ::= SEQUENCE OF ArchiveTimeStamp

   ArchiveTimeStampSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF
                                ArchiveTimeStampChain


   ArchiveTimeStampChain and ArchiveTimeStampSequence MUST be ordered
   ascending by time of timestamp.  Within an ArchiveTimeStampChain all
   reducedHashtrees of the contained ArchiveTimeStamps MUST use the same
   Hash-Algorithm.

5.2.  Generation

   A first Initial Archive Timestamp relates to a data object or a data
   object group.  Before cryptographic algorithms used within the
   Archive Timestamp become weak or timestamp certificates become
   invalid, Archive Timestamps have to be renewed by generating a new
   Archive Timestamp.

   In the case of Timestamp Renewal, the content of the timeStamp field
   of the old Archive Timestamp has to be hashed and timestamped by a
   new Archive Timestamp.  The new Archive Timestamp MAY not contain a
   reducedHashtree field, if the timestamp only simply covers the
   previous timestamp.  However generally, one can collect a number of
   old Archive Timestamps and build the new hash-tree with the hash
   values of the content of their timeStamp fields.

   The new Archive Timestamp MUST be added to the ArchiveTimestampChain.
   This hash-tree of the new Archive Timestamp MUST use the same hash
   algorithm as the old one, which is specified in the digestAlgorithm
   field of the Archive Timestamp or if this value is not set (as it is
   optional) within the timestamp itself.

   In the case of Hash-Tree Renewal, the Archive Timestamp and the
   archived data objects covered by the Archive Timestamp must be hashed
   and timestamped again, as described below:

   1.  Select a secure hash algorithm H.

   2.  Select data objects d(i) referred to by initial Archive Timestamp
       (objects which are still present and not deleted).  Generate hash
       values h(i) = H((d(i)).  If data groups with more than one
       document are present, then one will have more than one hash for a
       group, i.e. h(i_a), h(i_b).., h(i_n)

   3.  atsc(i) is the encoded ArchiveTimeStampSequence, the
       concatenation of all previous Archive Timestamp Chains (in
       chronological order) related to data object d(i).  Generate hash
       value ha(i) = H(atsc(i)).
       Note: The ArchiveTimeStampChains used are DER encoded, i.e. they
       contain sequence and length tags.

   4.  Concatenate each h(i) with ha(i) and generate hash values
       h(i)' = H (h(i)+ ha(i)).  For multi-document groups, this is:
       h(i_a)' = H (h(i_a)+ ha(i))
       h(i_b)' = H (h(i_b)+ ha(i)) etc.

   5.  Build a new Archive Time Stamp for each h(i)'. (hash-tree
       generation and reduction is defined in Section 4.2, note that

       each h(i)' will be treated in Section 4.2 as the document hash.
       The first hash value list in the reduced hash-tree should only
       contain h(i)'.  For a multi-document group, the first hash value
       list will contain the new hashes for all the documents in this
       group, i.e. h(i_a)', h(i_b)'.., h(i_n)')

   6.  Create new ArchiveTimeStampChain containing the new Archive
       Timestamp and append this ArchiveTimeStampChain to the
       ArchiveTimeStampSequence.

     h2abc = H( binary sorted and concatenated (h2a', h2b', h2c'))

   ArchiveTimeStamps that are not necessary for verification should not
   be added to an ArchiveTimeStampChain or ArchiveTimeStampSequence.

5.3.  Verification

   To get an non-repudiation proof that a data object existed at a
   certain time, the Archive Timestamp Chains and their relations to
   each other and to the data objects have to be proved:

   1.  Verify that the first Archive Timestamp of the first
       ArchiveTimestampChain (the Initial Archive Timestamp) contains
       the hash value of the data object.

   2.  Verify each ArchiveTimestampChain.  The first hash value list of
       each ArchiveTimeStamp must contain the hash value of the
       timestamp of the Archive Timestamp before.  Each Archive
       Timestamp must be valid relative to the time of the following
       Archive Timestamp.  All Archive Timestamps within a chain MUST
       use the same hash algorithm and this algorithm MUST be secure at
       the time of the first Archive Timestamp of the following
       ArchiveTimeStampChain.

   3.  Verify the first hash value list (partialHashtree) of the first
       Archive Timestamp of all other ArchiveTimeStampChains contains a

       hash value of the concatenation of the data object hash and the
       hash value of all older ArchiveTimeStampChain.  Verify that this
       Archive Timestamp was generated before the last Archive Timestamp
       of the ArchiveTimeStampChain became invalid.

   In order to complete the non-repudiation proof for the data objects,
   the last Archive Timestamp has to be valid at the time the
   verification is performed.

   If the proof is necessary for more than one data object, steps 1 and
   3 have to be done for all these data objects.  To prove the Archive
   Timestamp Sequence relates to a data object group, verify that each
   first Archive Timestamp of the first ArchiveTimeStampChain of the
   ArchiveTimeStampSequence of each data object does not contain other
   hash values in its first hash value list (than the hash values of the
   other data objects).


6.  Encryption

   If service providers are used to archive data and generate Archive
   Timestamps, it might be desirable or required that clients only send
   encrypted data to be archived.  However, this means that evidence
   records refer to encrypted data objects.  ERS directly protects the
   integrity of the bit-stream and this freezes the bit structure at the
   time of archiving.  This precludes changing of the encryption scheme
   during the archival period, e.g., if the encryption scheme is no
   longer secure a change is not possible without losing the integrity
   proof of the EvidenceRecord.  In such cases the services of a data
   transformation (and by this also possible re-encryption) done by a
   notary service might be a possible solution.  To avoid problems when
   using the evidence records in the future, additional special
   precautions have to be taken:

   o  Evidence generated to prove the existence of encrypted data cannot
      always be relied upon to prove the existence of unencrypted data.
      It may be possible to choose an algorithm or a key for decryption
      that is not the algorithm or key used for encryption.  In this
      case, the evidence record would not be a non-repudiation proof for
      the unencrypted data.  Therefore, only encryption methods should
      be used that make it possible to prove that archive timestamped
      encrypted data objects unambiguously represent unencrypted data
      objects.  All data necessary to prove unambiguous representation
      should be included in the archived data objects.  (Note: In
      addition, the long term security of the encryption schemes should
      be analyzed to determine if it could be used to create collision
      attacks.)

   o  When a relying party uses an evidence record to prove the
      existence of encrypted data objects, it may be desirable for
      clients to only store the unencrypted data objects and to delete
      the encrypted copy.  In order to use the evidence record, it must
      then be possible to unambiguously re-encrypt the unencrypted data
      to get exactly the data that was originally archived.  Therefore,
      additional data necessary to re-encrypt data objects should be
      inserted into the evidence record by the client, i.e., the LTA
      never sees these values.

   An extensible structure is defined to store the necessary parameters
   of the encryption methods.  The use of the specified
   encryptionInfoType and encryptionInfoValue may be heavily dependent
   on the mechanisms and has to be defined in other specifications.

6.1.  Syntax

   The EncryptionInfo type in EvidenceRecord has the following syntax:

   ASN.1 EncryptionInfo

   ENCRYPTION-INFO-CLASS ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

   EncryptionInfos ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
         INSTANCE OF ENCRYPTION-INFO-CLASS


   encryptionInfos contains a set of instances of ENCRYPTION-INFO-CLASS
   objects that contain various pieces of information necessary for the
   unambiguous re-encryption of unencrypted content so that it exactly
   matches with the encrypted data objects protected by the
   EvidenceRecord.


7.  Security Considerations

   Secure Algorithms

   Cryptographic algorithms and parameters which are used within Archive
   Timestamps must be secure at the time of generation.  This concerns
   the hash algorithm used in the hash lists of Archive Timestamp as
   well as hash algorithms and public key algorithms of the timestamps.
   Publications regarding security suitability of cryptographic
   algorithms ([ETSI-TS102176-1-2005]) have to be considered by
   verifying components.  A generic solution for automatic
   interpretation of security suitability policies in electronic form is
   desirable but not subject of this specification.

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


   Redundancy

   Algorithms can lose there security suitability or Time Stamping
   Authorities may be considered as untrustworthy retrospectively.
   Therefore Archive Timestamps can lose their probative force.  If
   Archive Timestamps are managed centrally several redundant
   ArchiveTimeStampSequences can be generated using different hash
   algorithms and different Time Stamping Authorities.

   Secure Timestamps

   Archive Timestamping depends upon the security of normal time
   stamping.  Security requirements for Time Stamping Authorities stated
   in security policies have to be met.  Renewed Archive Timestamps
   should have the same or higher quality as the Initial Archive
   Timestamp.  Archive Timestamps used for signature renewal of signed
   data, should have the same or higher quality than maximum quality of
   the signatures.

   Secure Encryption

   For non-repudiation proof it does not matter whether encryption has
   been broken or not.  Nevertheless, users should keep secret their
   private keys and randoms used for encryption and disclose them only
   if needed, e.g. in a lawsuit to a judge or expert.  They should use
   encryption algorithms and parameters which are prospected to be
   unbreakable as long as confidentiality of the archived data is
   important.

Appendix A.  Evidence Record using CMS

   An Evidence Record can be added to signed data or enveloped data in
   order to transfer them in a conclusive way.  For CMS a sensible place
   to store such an Evidence Record is an unsigned attribute (signed
   message) or an unprotected attribute (enveloped message).

   The Evidence Record also contains information about the selection
   method which was used for the generation of the data objects to be
   timestamped.  In the case of CMS, two selection methods can be
   distinguished:

   1.  The CMS Object as a whole including contentInfo is selected as
       data object and archive timestamped.  This means that a hash
       value of the CMS object must be located in the first list of hash
       values of Archive Timestamps.

   2.  The CMS Object and the signed or encrypted content are included
       in the Archive Timestamp as separated objects.  In this case the
       hash value of the CMS Object as well as the hash value of the
       content has to be stored in the first list of hash values as a
       group of data objects.

   However, other selection methods could also be applied like for
   instance in [RFC3126].

   In the case of the two selection methods defined above, the Evidence
   Record has to be added to the first signature of the CMS Object of
   signed data.  Depending on the selection method, the following Object
   Identifiers are defined for the Evidence Record:

   ASN.1 Internal EvidenceRecord Attribute

   id-EvidenceRecord-Internal ::= {id-em 1}



Gondrom, et al.           Expires July 8, 2007                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                     ERS                      January 2007


   ASN.1 External EvidenceRecord Attribute

   id-EvidenceRecord-External ::= {id-em 2}


   The attributes should only occur once.  If they appear several times,
   they have to be stored within the first signature in a chronological
   order.

   If the CMS object doesn't have the EvidenceRecord Attributes - which
   indicates that the EvidenceRecord has been provided externally - the
   archive timestamped data object has to be generated over the complete
   CMS object within the existing coding.

   In case of verification, if only one EvidenceRecord is contained in
   the CMS object, the hash value must be generated over the CMS object
   without the one EvidenceRecord.  This means that the attribute has to
   be removed before verification.  The length of fields containing tags
   has to be adapted.  Apart from that, the existing coding must not be
   modified.

   If several Archive Timestamps occur, the data object has to be
   generated as follows:

   o  During verification of the first (in a chronological order)
      EvidenceRecord, all EvidenceRecord have to be removed in order to
      generate the data object.

   o  During verification of the nth one EvidenceRecord, the first n-1
      attributes should remain within the CMS object.

   o  The verification of the nth one EvidenceRecord must result in a
      point of time when the document must have existed with the first n
      attributes.  The verification of the n+1th attribute must prove
      that this requirement has been met.
