   Abstract 

      This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event 
      package "DTMFAD" to allow the use of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY to collect 
      DTMF signals.  This package is required to implement Committee T1 
      Technical Report T1.TR.82-2003. 

      The "DTMFAD" event package requires the definition of two new Event 
      header field parameters.  This package also requires the use of a new 
      MIME type, application/DTMF-event, to allow for the transfer of DTMF 
      data in the NOTIFY body.  Registration of this MIME type is also 
      provided in this document.  

      This document has been produced, on behalf of Committee T1, as part 
      of the IANA registration process.

   1 Introduction 

      This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event 
      package, DTMFAD, which is needed to implement Committee T1 Technical 
      Report T1.TR.82-2003 [5].  The DTMFAD event package requires the 
      definition of two new Event header field parameters thereby allowing 
      use of SUBSCRIBE to request DTMF monitoring and NOTIFY bodies to 
      return detected digits.  This package also requires the use of a new 
      MIME type, which is also specified in this document, to allow for the 
      transfer of data in the NOTIFY body. 

      This document has been produced, on behalf of Committee T1, as part 
      of the IANA registration process as required by RFC 3427. 

   2 Terminology 

      In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
      "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
      and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3] and 
      indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations. 

   3 Usage Scenarios 

      This event package MAY be used to allow an application server 
      (subscriber) to request DTMF monitoring and notification of detection 
      from a receiving agent (notifier) in order to enable a caller-
      initiated re-origination request while a call is in progress.  There 
      are other possible applications of this event package.   

   4 Package Definition  

      This section provides the detail necessary to specify the event 
      package DTMFAD as required by Section 4 of [2]. 

   4.1 Event Package Name 

      The name of this package is "DTMFAD". As allowed by [2], this value 
      appears in the Event header present in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests.  

      Example: 

         Event: DTMFAD;duration=<duration>][;events=<event-
         set>][;maxrate=<rate>][;id=<id>] 

   4.2 Event Package Parameters  

      Three new event header field parameters are defined for this event 
      package: "duration", "event-set", and "maxrate".  They are defined as 
      follows:

      duration 

      "duration" is an optional parameter that defines the duration of a 
      continuous DTMF tone (in milliseconds) that will cause the notifier 
      to send a NOTIFY request before detecting the end of the tone.  A 
      NOTIFY request is always sent when the notifier detects the end of 
      the key press, but additional NOTIFY requests will be sent during the 
      key press if the tone persists for the value of "duration" beyond the 
      time that the previous NOTIFY was sent.  If the "duration" parameter 
      is omitted, event notification occurs only when the end of the DTMF 
      tone is detected. 

         Note: for long key presses, combined with short values of 
         "duration", a single DTMF digit can result in many NOTIFY 
         requests.  With calling card re-origination requests, in 
         particular, the Application Server (AS) cannot provide a prompt 
         for a new destination number or begin collecting digits if the 
         caller is still pressing a DTMF key, so the AS must wait for 
         completion of the tone.  Therefore, it is likely that sending 
         NOTIFY requests at the termination of each detected DTMF digit is 
         preferable to sending many NOTIFY requests for each digit.  As a 
         result, it is RECOMMENDED that the AS not include the "duration" 
         parameter. 

      event-set 

      "event-set" is an optional parameter defining the set of events that 
      are to be detected by the notifier.  For DTMF tones, the set 
      includes: digits 0 through 9 (decimal 0-9); the * key (hexadecimal 
      a); the # key (hexadecimal b); and special digits A through D 
      (hexadecimal c-f).  As described in Section 4.7, the notifier will 
      report each detected DTMF digit as a discrete event and it is the 
      responsibility of the subscriber to reconstruct the sequence of 
      digits into a string.  As a result, the subscriber SHOULD request 
      reporting of all DTMF digits, not just one or two specific DTMF 
      values.  The "event-set" parameter is optional, and if not included 
      in the SUBSCRIBE request will be assumed to be the default set of 
      hexadecimal values 0-f (i.e. all DTMF digits). 

      maxrate 

      "maxrate" is an optional parameter defining a maximum number of 
      NOTIFY transactions per minute initiated to report DTMF events.  The 
      notifier MUST NOT exceed this limit in any one minute period, but MAY 
      send notifications in more rapid bursts over shorter periods.  If 
      "maxrate" is omitted, the notifier MUST limit reporting to forty (40) 
      NOTIFY transactions per minute.  "maxrate" SHOULD NOT exceed 60. 


    
    
   Zebarth                  Expires - April 2004                 [Page 4] 
                SIP Event Package for DTMF Event Monitoring  October 2003 
    
    
      If the reporting rate limit causes a queue of unreported events to 
      build up, the notifier MAY discard some or all of the excess events.  
      If the notifier can choose which events to discard, the notifier 
      SHOULD discard notifications of uncompleted DTMF events resulting 
      from the presence of the "duration" parameter before discarding 
      notifications of completed DTMF events. 

      See also the discussion of maximum reporting rate in Section 4.11 
      below. 

   4.2.1 Syntax 

      From the ABNF in RFC 3325 [1]: 

         event-param = generic-param / ( "id" EQUAL token ) 

      This document extends the definition of event-param as follows: 

         event-param =/ dur-param / evset-param / maxrate-param 

         dur-param = "duration" EQUAL 2*4DIGIT 
            ; duration (ms) triggering an early NOTIFY 

         evset-param = "event-set" = 1*16( DIGIT / %x61-66 )  
            ; set of digit events to be detected, 0-9 and "a" through "f" 
            ; at most one instance of each 

         maxrate-param = "maxrate" EQUAL 1*2DIGIT 
            ; maximum number of events to be reported per minute 

   4.3 SUBSCRIBE Bodies  

      The DTMFAD event package does not use a SUBSCRIBE body. 

   4.4 Subscription Duration  

      The default value for subscription duration is 3600 seconds.  The 
      subscriber MAY include an Expires header in the SUBSCRIBE request 
      asking for a different duration. 

   4.5 NOTIFY Bodies  

      The package makes provision for the use of one NOTIFY body type, only 
      for the reporting of DTMF events.  The MIME type application/DTMF-
      event has been defined for this purpose; see Section 7.2. 

      No body is specified in this package for the initial NOTIFY request 
      indicating that the subscription has been accepted, or for a NOTIFY 
      request indicating a subscription state change.

   4.6 Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE Requests 

      The subscriber generates a SUBSCRIBE request in accordance with RFC 
      3265.  This request MUST include an Event header field specifying the 
      DTMFAD event package.  The header field MAY include the duration, 
      event-set, and/or maxrate parameters, although as discussed in 
      Section 4.2, the use of the duration parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED. 

      The SUBSCRIBE request SHOULD include the Accept header field, 
      indicating acceptance of the application/DTMF-event MIME type.  

   4.7 Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests  

      If the notifier finds that the SUBSCRIBE invokes the DTMFAD package, 
      it MUST check for the presence of the duration, event-set, and 
      maxrate parameters.  If these parameters are present, the notifier 
      MAY accept them or MAY modify them as described in Section 4.8.1.  If 
      any of these parameters are absent, the notifier MUST assume that the 
      default value as specified in Section 4.2 was received. 

      If an Accept header is not present in the SUBSCRIBE request, the 
      receiving agent MUST assume that the subscriber will accept a MIME 
      type of application/DTMF-event as defined in Section 7.2.  If the 
      Accept header field is present but does not specify the 
      application/DTMF-event MIME type, the notifier MUST reject the 
      subscription using a 406 Not Acceptable response. 

   4.8 Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests  

      The notifier MUST generate a NOTIFY request: 

       - immediately upon receipt of a SUBSCRIBE request 

       - upon a state change, e.g. to confirm a refresh, to confirm a 
         cancellation requested by the subscriber, or to report 
         cancellation triggered at the point of detection. 

       - to report a DTMF event. 

   4.8.1 NOTIFY Upon Receipt of SUBSCRIBE Request 

      [1] requires that a NOTIFY be generated to indicate the state of a 
      subscription when the SUBSCRIBE was given a 200 or 202 final 
      response.  For the DTMFAD package, this NOTIFY request MUST include 
      an Event header field indicating the DTMFAD package and possibly 
      including the duration, event-set, and maxrate parameters as follows: 

      The duration parameter MUST be present if it was present in the 
      SUBSCRIBE request.  Its value in the NOTIFY indicates the duration 
    
    
   Zebarth                  Expires - April 2004                 [Page 6] 
                SIP Event Package for DTMF Event Monitoring  October 2003 
    
    
      the notifier is prepared to use for early DTMF event reporting.  The 
      value returned in the NOTIFY MAY be larger than the value received in 
      the SUBSCRIBE, if the notifier is unable or unwilling to support the 
      requested value.  The value in the NOTIFY MUST be zero (0), if the 
      notifier is unwilling to report DTMF events until they have ended. 

      The event-set parameter MUST be present if it was present in the 
      SUBSCRIBE request, and must have the same content. 

      The maxrate parameter MUST always be present.  It MAY be smaller than 
      the value provided in the SUBSCRIBE request, but MUST NOT be larger. 

   4.8.2 NOTIFY Upon Change of Subscription State 

      The Event header field for a NOTIFY generated as a result of a change 
      in subscription state MUST be identical to that included in the 
      initial NOTIFY, as described above. 

   4.8.3 NOTIFY To Report DTMF Events 

      A DTMF event is recognized each time the end of a DTMF tone within 
      the event set is detected.  In addition, if a non-zero value of the 
      duration parameter was returned in the confirming NOTIFY as described 
      in Section 4.8.1, a DTMF event is recognized whenever a tone within 
      the event set has a cumulative duration equal to an integer multiple 
      of the value of the duration parameter.  Subject to the deletion of 
      queued detected events as described in Sections 4.2 and 4.11, a 
      NOTIFY MUST be sent for each detected event, in the order in which 
      the events were detected. 

      A NOTIFY reporting a DTMF event MUST contain an Event header field 
      identical to the one sent in the initial NOTIFY.  It MUST also 
      contain a body of type application/DTMF-event, reporting the type of 
      DTMF event detected, its cumulative duration, its volume, and whether 
      it has completed. 

      Because the order of DTMF events is significant, and to provide a 
      mechanism for throttling of bursts of events, the notifier MUST NOT 
      initiate a NOTIFY transaction to report a DTMF event until the final 
      response has been received for the previous DTMF event reporting 
      transaction. 

      As a result of this restriction and of the application of the maxrate 
      parameter, DTMF events may be queued for reporting.  If, as a result 
      of a non-zero duration parameter value, two events are queued 
      relating to the same occurrence of a DTMF tone, the notifier SHOULD 
      discard the earlier event rather than report it.

   4.9 Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests  

      If the subscriber finds that the values of the parameters returned in 
      the initial NOTIFY request are unacceptable, it MAY terminate the 
      subscription.  Aside from this, the DTMFAD package does not require 
      any specific processing of NOTIFY requests. 

   4.10 Handling of Forked Requests  

      This package does not allow forked SUBSCRIBE requests to install 
      multiple subscriptions with the same notifier.  

   4.11 Rate of Notifications  

      The DTMFAD package provides two throttling mechanisms for the 
      reporting of DTMF events.  The first one is explicit control by the 
      maxrate parameter, as described in Section 4.2.  The second is the 
      implicit throttling provided by the requirement that each report be 
      acknowledged before the next is sent, as described in Section 4.8.3.  
      The maxrate control is deliberately set up to allow for short-term 
      bursts, because of the bursty nature of DTMF input.  Thus the two 
      controls are complementary. 

   4.12 State Agents  

      State agents have no role in the handling of this package.

   6 Security Considerations  

      Security considerations for SIP event packages are discussed in RFC 
      3265 [2], and those considerations apply here.  

      A special consideration applying to the DTMFAD package is to ensure 
      that a caller playing with DTMF keys does not take down the network.  
      Thus event throttling is very important.  Section 4.11 points out the 
      measures provided in this package for event throttling. 

   7 IANA Considerations  

      This document registers a new SIP Event Package ÙDTMFADˆ and a new 
      MIME type Ùmessage/DTMF-eventˆ. 

   7.1 SIP Event Package Registration  

      Package name: DTMFAD  

      Type: package  

      Contact: Joe Zebarth <zebarth@nortelnetworks.com> 

      Published Specification: RFC XXXX (Note to RFC Editor: Please           
      fill in XXXX with the RFC number of this specification). 

   7.2 application/DTMF-event MIME Registration  

      MIME media type name: application  

      MIME subtype name: DTMF-event  

      Mandatory parameters: none  

      Optional parameters:  none. 

      Encoding considerations: encoding scheme is binary.  

      The notifier shall encode the DTMF-event as four octets as shown 
      below.

                           Table 1: DTMF named events 
    
      E field: If set to a value of Ùoneˆ, the "end" bit indicates that 
      this packet contains the end of the event and thus the duration 
      parameter reported in this event measures the complete duration of 
      the event. 

      R field: This field is reserved for future use. The notifier MUST set 
      it to Ùzeroˆ and the subscriber MUST ignore it. 

      volume field: For DTMF digits this field describes the power level of 
      the tone, expressed in dBm0 after dropping the sign. Power levels 
      range from 0 to -63 dBm0. Thus, larger values denote lower volume. 
      The range of valid DTMF is from 0 to -36 dBm0 (must accept); lower 
      than -55 dBm0 must be rejected (TR-TSY-000181, ITU-T Q.24A).  Since 
      it is expected that applications will not use volume as a criterion 
      of acceptance, the notifier MAY set the level to a consistent 
      arbitrary value, e.g. 15, when the DTMF tone level is between 0 to 
      36. 

      duration field: Duration of this digit event in milliseconds (Since 
      the beginning of this digit event).  Thus, this field is sufficient 
      to express event durations of up to approximately 65.535 seconds.
