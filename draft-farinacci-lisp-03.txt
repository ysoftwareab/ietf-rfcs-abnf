Abstract

   This draft describes a simple, incremental, network-based protocol to
   implement separation of Internet addresses into Endpoint Identifiers
   (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  This mechanism requires no
   changes to host stacks and no major changes to existing database
   infrastructures.  The proposed protocol can be implemented in a
   relatively small number of routers.

   This proposal was stimulated by the problem statement effort at the
   Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS), which took
   place in October 2006.

2.  Introduction

   Many years of discussion about the current IP routing and addressing
   architecture have noted that its use of a single numbering space (the
   "IP address") for both host transport session identification and
   network routing creates scaling issues (see [CHIAPPA] and [RFC1498]).
   A number of scaling benefits would be realized by separating the
   current IP address into separate spaces for Endpoint Identifiers
   (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs); among them are:

   1.  Reduction of routing table size in the "default-free zone" (DFZ).
       Use of a separate numbering space for RLOCs will allow them to be
       assigned topologically (in today's Internet, RLOCs would be
       assigned by providers at client network attachment points),
       greatly improving aggregation and reducing the number of
       globally-visible, routable prefixes.

   2.  Easing of renumbering burden when clients change providers.
       Because host EIDs are numbered from a separate, non-provider-
       assigned and non-topologically-bound space, they do not need to
       be renumbered when a client site changes its attachment points to
       the network.

   3.  Mobility with session survivability.  Because session state is
       associated with a persistent host EID, it should be possible for
       a host (or a collection of hosts) to move to a different point in
       the network topology (whether by changing providers or by
       physically moving) without disruption of connectivity.

   4.  Traffic engineering capabilities that can be performed by network
       elements and do not depend on injecting additional state into the
       routing system.  This will fall out of the mechanism that is used
       to implement the EID/RLOC split (see Section 4).

   This draft describes protocol mechanisms to achieve the desired
   functional separation.  For flexibility, the document decouples the
   mechanism used for forwarding packets from that used to determine EID
   to RLOC mappings.  This work is in response to and intended to
   address the problem statement that came out of the RAWS effort
   [RAWS].

   This draft focuses on a router-based solution.  Building the solution
   into the network should facilitate incremental deployment of the
   technology on the Internet.  Note that while the detailed protocol
   specification and examples in this document assume IP version 4
   (IPv4), there is nothing in the design that precludes use of the same
   techniques and mechanisms for IPv6.  It should be possible for IPv4
   packets to use IPv6 RLOCs and for IPv6 EIDs to be mapped to IPv4

   RLOCs.

   Related work on host-based solutions is described in Shim6 [SHIM6]
   and HIP [RFC4423].  Related work on other router-based solutons is
   described in GSE [GSE].  This draft attempts to not compete or
   overlap with such solutions and the proposed protocol changes are
   expected to complement a host-based mechanism when Traffic
   Engineering functionality is desired.

   Some of the design goals of this proposal include:

   1.  Minimize required changes to Internet infrastructure.

   2.  Require no hardware or software changes to end-systems (hosts).

   3.  Be incrementally deployable.

   4.  Require no router hardware changes.

   5.  Minimize router software changes.

   6.  Avoid or minimize packet loss when EID-to-RLOC mappings need to
       be performed.

   There are 4 variants of LISP, which differ along a spectrum of strong
   to weak dependence on the topological nature and possible need for
   routability of EIDs.  The variants are:

   LISP 1:  where EIDs are routable through the RLOC topology for
      bootstrapping EID-to-RLOC mappings.  [LISP1]

   LISP 1.5:  where EIDs are routable for bootstrapping EID-to-RLOC
      mappings; such routing is via a separate topology.

   LISP 2:  where EIDS are not routable and EID-to-RLOC mappings are
      implemented within the DNS.  [LISP2]

   LISP 3:  where non-routable EIDs are used as lookup keys for a new
      EID-to-RLOC mapping database.  Use of Distributed Hash Tables
      [DHTs] to implement such a database would be an area to explore.
      Other examples of new mapping database services are [CONS],
      [RPMD], [NERD], and [APT].

   This document will focus on LISP 1 and LISP 1.5, both of which rely
   on a router-based distributed cache and database for EID-to-RLOC
   mappings.  The LISP 2 and LISP 3 mechanisms, which require separate
   EID-to-RLOC infrastructure, will be documented in additional drafts.

3.  Definition of Terms

   Provider Independent (PI) Addresses:   an address block assigned from
      a pool that is not associated with any service provider and is
      therefore not topologically-aggregatable in the routing system.

   Provider Assigned (PA) Addresses:   a block of IP addresses that are
      assigned to a site by each service provider to which a site
      connects.  Typically, each block is sub-block of a service
      provider CIDR block and is aggregated into the larger block before
      being advertised into the global Internet.  Traditionally, IP
      multihoming has been implemented by each multi-homed site
      acquiring its own, globally-visible prefix.  LISP uses only
      topologically-assigned and aggregatable address blocks for RLOCs,
      eliminating this demonstrably non-scalable practice.

   Routing Locator (RLOC):   the IPv4 or IPv6 address of an egress
      tunnel router (ETR).  It is the output of a EID-to-RLOC mapping
      lookup.  An EID maps to one or more RLOCs.  Typically, RLOCs are
      numbered from topologically-aggregatable blocks that are assigned
      to a site at each point to which it attaches to the global
      Internet; where the topology is defined by the connectivity of
      provider networks, RLOCs can be thought of as PA addresses.
      Multiple RLOCs can be assigned to the same ETR device or to
      multiple ETR devices at a site.

   Endpoint ID (EID):   a 32- or 128-bit value used in the source and
      destination address fields of the first (most inner) LISP header
      of a packet.  The host obtains a destination EID the same way it
      obtains an destination address today, for example through a DNS
      lookup or SIP exchange.  The source EID is obtained via existing
      mechanisms used to set a hosts "local" IP address.  An EID is
      allocated to a host from an EID-prefix block associated with the
      site the host is attached to.  An EID can be used by a host to
      refer to other hosts.  LISP uses PI blocks for EIDs; such EIDs
      MUST NOT be used as LISP RLOCs.  Note that EID blocks may be
      assigned in a hierarchical manner, independent of the network
      topology, to facilitate scaling of the mapping database.  In
      addition, an EID block assigned to a site may have site-local
      structure (subnetting) for routing within the site; this structure
      is not visible to the global routing system.

   EID-prefix:   A power-of-2 block of EIDs which are allocated to a
      site by an address allocation authority.  EID-prefixes are
      associated with a set of RLOC addresses which make up a "database
      mapping".  EID-prefix allocations can be broken up into smaller
      blocks when an RLOC set is to be associated with the smaller EID-
      prefix.

   End-system:   is an IPv4 or IPv6 device that originates packets with
      a single IPv4 or IPv6 header.  The end-system supplies an EID
      value for the destination address field of the IP header when
      communicating globally (i.e. outside of it's routing domain).  An
      end-system can be a host computer, a switch or router device, or
      any network appliance.  An iPhone.

   Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):   a router which accepts an IP packet
      with a single IP header (more precisely, an IP packet that does
      not contain a LISP header).  The router treats this "inner" IP
      destination address as an EID and performs an EID-to-RLOC mapping
      lookup.  The router then prepends an "outer" IP header with one of
      its globally-routable RLOCs in the source address field and the
      result of the mapping lookup in the destination address field.
      Note that this destination RLOC may be an intermediate, proxy
      device that has better knowledge of the EID-to-RLOC mapping
      closest to the destination EID.  In general, an ITR receives IP
      packets from site end-systems on one side and sends LISP-
      encapsulated IP packets toward the Internet on the other side.

      Specifically, when a service provider prepends a LISP header for
      Traffic Engineering purposes, the router that does this is also
      regarded as an ITR.  The outer RLOC the ISP ITR uses can be based
      on the outer destination address (the originating ITR's supplied
      RLOC) or the inner destination address (the originating hosts
      supplied EID).

   TE-ITR:   is an ITR that is deployed in a service provider network
      that prepends an additional LISP header for Traffic Engineering
      purposes.

   Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):   a router that accepts an IP packet
      where destination address in the "outer" IP header is one of its
      own RLOCs.  The router strips the "outer" header and forwards the
      packet based on the next IP header found.  In general, an ETR
      receives LISP-encapsulated IP packets from the Internet on one
      side and sends decapsulated IP packets to site end-systems on the
      other side.  ETR functionality does not have to be limited to a
      router device.  A server host can be the endpoint of a LISP tunnel
      as well.

   TE-ETR:   is an ETR that is deployed in a service provider network
      that strips an outer LISP header for Traffic Engineering purposes.

   EID-to-RLOC Cache:   a short-lived, on-demand database in an ITR that
      stores, tracks, and is responsible for timing-out and otherwise
      validating EID-to-RLOC mappings.  This cache is distinct from the
      "database", the cache is dynamic, local, and relatively small

Internet-Draft    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)      August 2007


      while and the database is distributed, relatively static, and much
      global in scope.

   EID-to-RLOC Database:   a globally, distributed database that
      contains all known EID-prefix to RLOC mappings.  Each potential
      ETR typically contains a small piece of the database: the EID-to-
      RLOC mappings for the EID prefixes "behind" the router.  These map
      to one of the router's own, globally-visible, IP addresses.

   Recursive Tunneling:   when a packet has more than one LISP IP
      header.  Additional layers of tunneling may be employed to
      implement traffic engineering or other re-routing as needed.  When
      this is done, an additional "outer" LISP header is added and the
      original RLOCs are preserved in the "inner" header.

   Reencapsulating Tunnels:   when a packet has no more than one LISP IP
      header (two IP headers total) and when it needs to be diverted to
      new RLOC, an ETR can decapsulate the packet (remove the LISP
      header) and prepend a new tunnel header, with new RLOC, on to the
      packet.  Doing this allows a packet to be re-routed by the re-
      encapsulating router without adding the overhead of additional
      tunnel headers.

   LISP Header:   a term used in this document to refer to the outer
      IPv4 or IPv6 header, a UDP header, and a LISP header, an ITR
      prepends or an ETR strips.

   Address Family Indicator (AFI):   a term used to describe an address
      encoding in a packet.  An address family currently pertains to an
      IPv4 or IPv6 address.  See [AFI] for details.

4.  Basic Overview

   One key concept of LISP is that end-systems (hosts) operate the same
   way they do today.  The IP addresses that hosts use for tracking
   sockets, connections, and for sending and receiving packets do not
   change.  In LISP terminology, these IP addresses are called Endpoint
   Identifiers (EIDs).

   Routers continue to forward packets based on IP destination
   addresses.  These addresses are referred to as Routing Locators
   (RLOCs).  Most routers along a path between two hosts will not
   change; they continue to perform routing/forwarding lookups on
   addresses (RLOCs) in the IP header.

   This design introduces "Tunnel Routers", which prepend LISP headers
   on host-originated packets and strip them prior to final delivery to
   their destination.  The IP addresses in this "outer header" are
   RLOCs.  During end-to-end packet exchange between two Internet hosts,
   an ITR prepends a new LISP header to each packet and an egress tunnel
   router strips the new header.  The ITR performs EID-to-RLOC lookups
   to determine the routing path to the the ETR, which has the RLOC as
   one of its IP addresses.

   Some basic rules governing LISP are:

   o  End-systems (hosts) only know about EIDs.

   o  EIDs are always IP addresses assigned to hosts.

   o  Routers mostly deal with Routing Locator addresses.  See details
      later in Section 4.1 to clarify what is meant by "mostly".

   o  RLOCs are always IP addresses assigned to routers; preferably,
      topologically-oriented addresses from provider CIDR blocks.

   o  Routers can use their RLOCs as EIDs but can also be assigned EIDs
      when performing host functions.  Those EIDs MUST NOT be used as
      RLOCs.  When EIDs are used the routeability of them is scoped to
      within the site.  A hybrid use of this, for example is when a
      router runs the BGP protocol where iBGP peerings may use EIDs and
      eBGP peerings may use RLOCs.

   o  EIDs are not expected to be usable for global end-to-end
      communication in the absence of an EID-to-RLOC mapping operation.
      They are expected to be used locally for intra-site communication.

   o  EID prefixes are likely to be hierarchically assigned in a manner
      which is optimized for administrative convenience and to

Internet-Draft    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)      August 2007


      facilitate scaling of the EID-to-RLOC mapping database.  The
      hierarchy is based on a address alocation hierarchy which is not
      dependent on the network toplogy.

   o  EIDs may also be structured (subnetted) in a manner suitable for
      local routing within an autonomous system.

   An additional LISP header may be pre-pended to packets by a transit
   router (i.e.  TE-ITR) when re-routing of the end-to-end path for a
   packet is desired.  An obvious instance of this would be an ISP
   router that needs to perform traffic engineering for packets in flow
   through its network.  In such a situation, termed Recursive
   Tunneling, an ISP transit acts as an additional ingress tunnel router
   and the RLOC it uses for the new prepended header would be either an
   TE-ETR within the ISP (along intra-ISP traffic engineered path) or in
   an TE-ETR within another ISP (an inter-ISP traffic engineered path,
   where an agreement to build such a path exists).

   Tunnel Routers can be placed fairly flexibly in a multi-AS topology.
   For example, the ITR for a particular end-to-end packet exchange
   might be the first-hop or default router within a site for the source
   host.  Similarly, the egress tunnel router might be the last-hop
   router directly-connected to the destination host.  Another example,
   perhaps for a VPN service out-sourced to an ISP by a site, the ITR
   could be the site's border router at the service provider attachment
   point.  Mixing and matching of site-operated, ISP-operated, and other
   tunnel routers is allowed for maximum flexibility.  See Section 8 for
   more details.

4.1.  Packet Flow Sequence

   This section provides an example of the unicast packet flow with the
   following parameters:

   o  Source host "host1.abc.com" is sending a packet to
      "host2.xyz.com".

   o  Each site is multi-homed, so each tunnel router has an address
      (RLOC) assigned from each of the site's attached service provider
      address blocks.

   o  The ITR and ETR are directly connected to the source and
      destination, respectively.

   Client host1.abc.com wants to communicate with server host2.xyz.com:

Internet-Draft    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)      August 2007


   1.  host1.abc.com wants to open a TCP connection to host2.xyz.com.
       It does a DNS lookup on host2.xyz.com.  An A/AAAA record is
       returned.  This address is used as the destination EID and the
       locally-assigned address of host1.abc.com is used as the source
       EID.  An IP/IPv6 packet is built using the EIDs in the IP/IPv6
       header and sent to the default router.

   2.  The default router is configured as an ITR.  It prepends a LISP
       header to the packet, with one of its RLOCs as the source IP/IPv6
       address and uses the destination EID from the original packet
       header as the destination IP/IPv6 address.  Subsequent packets
       continue to behave the same way until a mapping is learned.

   3.  In LISP 1, the packet is routed through the Internet as it is
       today.  In LISP 1.5, the packet is routed on a different topology
       which may have EID prefixes distributed and advertised in an
       aggregatable fashion.  In either case, the packet arrives at the
       ETR.  The router is configured to "punt" the packet to the
       router's control-plane processor.  See Section 7 for more
       details.

   4.  The LISP header is stripped so that the packet can be forwarded
       by the router control-plane.  The router looks up the destination
       EID in the router's EID-to-RLOC database (not the cache, but the
       configured data structure of RLOCs).  An EID-to-RLOC Map-Reply
       message is originated by the egress router and is addressed to
       the source RLOC from the LISP header of the original packet (this
       is the ITR).  The source RLOC in the IP header of the UDP message
       is one of the ETR's RLOCs (one of the RLOCs that is embedded in
       the UDP payload).

   5.  The ITR receives the UDP message, parses the message (to check
       for format validity) and stores the EID-to-RLOC information from
       the packet.  This information is put in the ITR's EID-to-RLOC
       mapping cache (this is the on-demand cache, the cache where
       entries time out due to inactivity).

   6.  Subsequent packets from host1.abc.com to host2.xyz.com will have
       a LISP header prepended with the RLOCs learned from the ETR.

   7.  The egress tunnel receives these packets directly (since the
       destination address is one of its assigned IP addresses), strips
       the LISP header and delivers the packets to the attached
       destination host.

   In order to eliminate the need for a mapping lookup in the reverse
   direction, the ETR gleans RLOC information from the LISP header.
   Both ITR and the ETR may also influence the decision the other makes

5.  Tunneling Details

   This section describes the LISP Data Message which defines the
   tunneling header used to encapsulate IPv4 and IPv6 packets which
   contain EID addresses.  Even though the following formats illustrate
   IPv4-in-IPv4 and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulations, the other 2
   combinations are supported as well.

   Since additional tunnel headers are prepended, the packet becomes
   larger and in theory can exceed the MTU of any link traversed from
   the ITR to the ETR.  It is recommended, in IPv4 that packets do not
   get fragmented as they are encapsulated by the ITR.  Instead, the
   packet is dropped and an ICMP Too Big message is returned to the
   source.

   In practice, this is not really a problem.  Hosts typically do not
   originate IP packets larger than 1500 bytes.  And second, a survey
   has been taken (from a list of ISPs, see Acknowledgement section)
   where nearly all ISP link MTUs are either 4470 bytes or support
   Ethernet jumbo frames of 9000 bytes.  Therefore, we don't anticipate
   any problems with prepending additional headers.

5.3.  Tunnel Header Field Descriptions

   IH Header:  is the inner header, preserved from the datagram received
      from the originating host.  The source and destination IP
      addresses are EIDs.

   OH Header:  is the outer header prepended by an ITR.  The address
      fields contain RLOCs obtained from the ingress router's EID-to-
      RLOC cache.  The IP protocol number is "UDP (17)" from [RFC0768].

   UDP Header:  contains a random source port allocated by the ITR when
      encapsulating a packet.  The destination port MUST be set to the
      well-known IANA assigned port value 4342.  The UDP checksum field
      MUST be transmitted as 0 and not ignore by the ETR.

   UDP Length:  field contains the original packet's length.  For an
      IPv4 encapsulated packet, the inner header Total Length is copied.
      For an IPv6 encapsualted packet, the inner header Payload Length
      plus the size of the IPv6 header (40 bytes) is copied.

   LISP Type:  set to 1 to encode a LISP Data Message.

   LISP Nonce:  is an ITR randomly generated 6-byte value which tests
      return routability of an ETR echoing back the none in a Map-Reply
      message.

   LISP Locator Reach Bits:  in the LISP header are set by an ITR to
      indicate to an ETR the reachability of the Locators in the source
      site.  Each RLOC in a Map-Reply is assigned an ordinal value from
      0 to n-1 (when there are n RLOCs in a mapping entry).  The Locator
      Reach Bits are number from 0 to n-1 from the right significant bit
      of the 12-bit field.  When a bit is set to 1, the ITR is
      indicating to the ETR the RLOC associated with the bit ordinal is
      reachable.  See Section 6.3 for details on how an ITR can
      determine other site ITRs are reachable.

   When doing Recursive Tunneling:

   o  The OH header Time to Live field (or Hop Limit field, in case of
      IPv6) MUST be copied from the IH header Time to Live field.

Internet-Draft    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)      August 2007


   o  The OH header Type of Service field (or the Traffic Class field,
      in the case of IPv6) SHOULD be copied from the IH header Type of
      Service field.

   When doing Re-encapsulated Tunneling:

   o  The new OH header Time to Live field SHOULD be copied from the
      stripped OH header Time to Live field.

   o  The new OH header Type of Service field SHOULD be copied from the
      stripped OH header Type of Service field.

   Copying the TTL serves two purposes.  First it preserves the distance
   the host intended the packet to travel.  And more importantly, it
   provides for suppression of looping packets in the event there is a
   loop of concatenated tunnels due to misconfiguration.

   The LISP UDP-based messages are the Map-Request and Map-Reply
   messages.  When a UDP Map-Request is sent, the UDP source port is
   chosen by the sender and the destination UDP port number is set to
   4342.  When a UDP Map-Reply is sent, the source UDP port number is
   set to 4342 and the destination UDP port number is copied from the
   source port of either the Map-Request of the invoking data packet.

   LISP-CONS [CONS] uses TCP with the same message formats.  However,
   this main LISP specification is the authoritative source for message
   format definitions for the Map-Request and Map-Reply messages.

6.1.2.  EID-to-RLOC UDP Map-Request Message

   A Map-Request contains one or more EIDs encoded in prefix format with
   a Locator count of 0.  The EID-prefix MUST NOT be more specific than
   a cache entry stored from a previously-received Map-Reply.

   A Map-Request is sent from an ITR when it wants to test an RLOC for
   reachability.  This is performed by using the RLOC as the destination
   address for Map-Request message with a randomly allocated source UDP
   port number and the well-known destination port number 4342.  A
   successful Map-Reply updates the cached set of RLOCs associated with
   the EID prefix range.

   Map-Requests MUST be rate-limited.  It is recommended that a Map-
   Request for the same EID-prefix be sent no more than once per second.

   Reserved:  Set to 0 on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   Record TTL:  The time in minutes the recipient of the Map-Reply will
      store the mapping.  If the TTL is 0, the entry should be removed
      from the cache immediately.  If the value is 0xffffffff, the
      recipient can decide locally how long to store the mapping.

   Locator count:  The number of Locator entries.  A locator entry
      comprises what is labeled above as 'Loc'.

   EID mask-len:  Mask length for EID prefix.

   A: The Authoritative bit, when sent by a UDP-based message is always
      set by the ETR.  See [CONS] for TCP-based Map-Replies.

   ITR-AFI:  Address family of the "Originating ITR RLOC Address" field.

   EID-AFI:  Address family of EID-prefix according to [RFC2434].

   Originating ITR RLOC Address:  Set to 0 for UDP-based messages.  See
      [CONS] for TCP-based Map-Replies.

   EID-prefix:  4 bytes if an IPv4 address-family, 16 bytes if an IPv6
      address-family.

   Priority:  each RLOC is assigned a priority.  Lower values are more
      preferable.  When multiple RLOCs have the same priority, they are
      used in a load-split fashion.  A value of 255 means the RLOC MUST
      NOT be used.

   Weight:  when priorities are the same for multiple RLOCs, the weight
      indicates how to balance traffic between them.  Weight is encoded
      as a percentage of total packets that match the mapping entry.  If
      a non-zero weight value is used for any RLOC, then all RLOCs must
      use a non-zero weight value and then the sum of all weight values
      MUST equal 100.  What did the 3rd grader say after Steve Jobs gave
      an iPhone demo to the class?  If a zero value is used for any RLOC
      weight, then all weights MUST be zero and the receiver of the Map-
      Reply will decide how to load-split traffic.

   Locator:  an IPv4 or IPv6 address (as encoded by the 'Loc-AFI' field)
      assigned to an ETR or router acting as a proxy replier for the
      EID-prefix.  Note that the destination RLOC address MAY be an
      anycast address if the tunnel egress point may be via more than
      one physical device.  A source RLOC can be an anycast address as
      well.  The source or destination RLOC MUST NOT be the broadcast
      address (255.255.255.255 or any subnet broadcast address known to
      the router), and MUST NOT be a link-local multicast address.  The

      source RLOC MUST NOT be a multicast address.  The destination RLOC
      SHOULD be a multicast address if it is being mapped from a
      multicast destination EID.

   Path Vector List:  See [CONS] for details.  This field is not used in
      UDP Map-Replies.

6.1.4.  EID-to-RLOC UDP Map-Reply Message

   When a data packet triggers a Map-Reply to be sent, the RLOCs
   associated with the EID-prefix matched by the EID in the original
   packet destination IP address field will be returned.  The RLOCs in
   the Map-Reply are the globally-routable IP addresses of the ETR but
   are not necessarily reachable; separate testing of reachability is
   required.

   Note that a Map-Reply may contain different EID-prefix granularity
   (prefix + length) than the Map-Request which triggers it.  This might
   occur if a Map-Request were for a prefix that had been returned by an
   earlier Map-Reply.  In such a case, the requester updates its cache
   with the new prefix information and granularity.  For example, a
   requester with two cached EID-prefixes that are covered by a Map-
   Reply containing one, less-specific prefix, replaces the entry with
   the less-specific EID-prefix.  Note that the reverse, replacement of
   one less-specific prefix with multiple more-specific prefixes, can
   also occur but not by removing the less-specific prefix rather by
   adding the more-specific prefixes which during a lookup will override
   the less-specific prefix.

   Replies SHOULD be sent for an EID-prefix no more often than once per
   second to the same requesting router.  For scalability, it is
   expected that aggregation of EID addresses into EID-prefixes will
   allow one Map-Reply to satisfy a mapping for the EID addresses in the
   prefix range thereby reducing the number of Map-Request messages.

   The addresses for a Data message or Map-Request message are swapped
   and used for sending the Map-Reply.  The UDP source and destination
   ports are swapped as well.  That is, the source port in the UDP
   header for the Map-Reply is set to the well-known UDP port number
   4342.

6.2.  Routing Locator Selection

   Both client-side and server-side may need control over the selection
   of RLOCs for conversations between them.  This control is achieved by
   manipulating the Priority and Weight fields in EID-to-RLOC Map-Reply
   messages.  Alternatively, RLOC information may be gleaned from
   received tunneled packets or EID-to-RLOC Map-Request messages.

Internet-Draft    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)      August 2007


   The following enumerates different scenarios for choosing RLOCs and
   the controls that are available:

   o  Server-side returns one RLOC.  Client-side can only use one RLOC.
      Server-side has complete control of the selection.

   o  Server-side returns a list of RLOC where a subset of the list has
      the same best priority.  Client can only use the subset list
      according to the weighting assigned by the server-side.  In this
      case, the server-side controls both the subset list and load-
      splitting across its members.  The client-side can use RLOCs
      outside of the subset list if it determines that the subset list
      is unreachable (unless RLOCs are set to a Priority of 255).  Some
      sharing of control exists: the server-side determines the
      destination RLOC list and load distribution while the client-side
      has the option of using alternatives to this list if RLOCs in the
      list are unreachable.

   o  Server-side sets weight of 0 for the RLOC subset list.  In this
      case, the client-side can choose how the traffic load is spread
      across the subset list.  Control is shared by the server-side
      determining the list and the client determining load distribution.
      Again, the client can use alternative RLOCs if the server-provided
      list of RLOCs are unreachable.

   o  Either side (more likely on the server-side ETR) decides not to
      send an Map-Request.  For example, if the server-side ETR does not
      send Map-Requests, it gleans RLOCs from the client-side ITR,
      giving the client-side ITR responsibility for bidirectional RLOC
      reachability and preferability.  Server-side ETR gleaning of the
      client-side ITR RLOC is done by caching the inner header source
      EID and the outer header source RLOC of received packets.  The
      client-side ITR controls how traffic is returned and can alternate
      using an outer header source RLOC, which then can be added to the
      list the server-side ETR uses to return traffic.  Since no
      Priority or Weights are provided using this method, the server-
      side ETR must assume each client-side ITR RLOC uses the same best
      Priority with a Weight of zero.  In addition, since EID-prefix
      encoding cannot be conveyed in data packets, the EID-to-RLOC cache
      on tunnel routers can grow to be very large.

   RLOCs that appear in EID-to-RLOC Map-Reply messages are considered
   reachable.  The Map-Reply and the database mapping service does not
   provide any reachability status for Locators.  This is done outside
   of the mapping service.  See next section for details.

6.3.  Routing Locator Reachability

   There are 4 methods for determining when a Locator is either
   reachable or has become unreachable:

   1.  Locator reachability is determined by an ETR by examining the
       Loc-Reach-Bits from a LISP header of a Data Message which is
       provided by an ITR when an ITR encapsulates data.

   2.  Locator unreachability is determined by an ITR by receiving ICMP
       Network or Host Unreachable messages.

   3.  ETR unreachability is determined when a host sends an ICMP Port
       Unreachable message.

   4.  Locator reachability is determined by receiving a Map-Reply
       message from a ETR's Locator address in response to a previously
       sent Map-Request.

   When determining Locator reachability by examining the Loc-Reach-Bits
   from the LISP Data Message, an ETR will receive up to date status
   from the ITR closest to the Locators at the source site.  The ITRs at
   the source site can determine reachability when running their IGP at
   the site.  When the ITRs are deployed on CE routers, typically a
   default route is injected into the site's IGP from each of the ITRs.
   If an ITR goes down, the CE-PE link goes down, or the PE router goes
   down, the CE router withdraws the default route.  This allows the
   other ITRs at the site to determine one of the Locators has gone
   unreachable.

   The Locators listed in a Map-Reply are numbered with ordinals 0 to
   n-1.  The Loc-Reach-Bits in a LISP Data Message are numbered from 0
   to n-1 starting with the least signfiicant bit numbered as 0.  So,
   for example, if the ITR with locator listed as the 3rd Locator
   position in the Map-Reply goes down, all other ITRs at the site will
   have the 3rd bit from the right cleared (the bit that corresponds to
   ordinal 2).

   When an ETR decapsulates a packet, it will look for a change in the
   Loc-Reach-Bits value.  When a bit goes from 1 to 0, the ETR will
   refrain from encapsulating packets to the Locator that has just gone
   unreachable.  It can start using the Locator again when the bit that
   corresponds to the Locator goes from 0 to 1.

   When ITRs at the site are not deployed in CE routers, the IGP can
   still be used to determine the reachability of Locators provided they
   are injected a stub links into the IGP.  This is typically done when
   a /32 address is configured on a loopback interface.

Internet-Draft    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)      August 2007


   When ITRs receive ICMP Network or Host Unreachable messages as a
   method to determine unreachability, they will refrain from using
   Locators which are described in Locator lists of Map-Replies.
   However, using this approach is unreliable because many network
   operators turn off generation of ICMP Unreachable messages.

   Optionally, an ITR can send a Map-Request to a Locator and if a Map-
   Reply is returned, reachability of the Locator has been achieved.
   Obviously, sending such probes increases the number of control
   messages originated by tunnel routers for active flows, so Locators
   are assumed to be reachable when they are advertised.

   This assumption does create a dependency: Locator unreachability is
   detected by the receipt of ICMP Host Unreachable messages.  When an
   Locator has been determined unreachable, it is not used for active
   traffic; this is the same as if it were listed in a Map-Reply with
   priority 255.

   The ITR can later test the reachability of the unreachable Locator by
   sending periodic Requests.  Both Requests and Replies MUST be rate-
   limited.  Locator reachability testing is never done with data
   packets since that increases the risk of packet loss for end-to-end
   sessions.

7.  Router Performance Considerations

   LISP is designed to be very hardware-based forwarding friendly.  By
   doing tunnel header prepending [RFC1955] and stripping instead of re-
   writing addresses, existing hardware could support the forwarding
   model with little or no modification.  Where modifications are
   required, they should be limited to re-programming existing hardware
   rather than requiring expensive design changes to hard-coded
   algorithms in silicon.

   A few implementation techniques can be used to incrementally
   implement LISP:

   o  When a tunnel encapsulated packet is received by an ETR, the outer
      destination address may not be the address of the router.  This
      makes it challenging for the control-plane to get packets from the
      hardware.  This may be mitigated by creating special FIB entries
      for the EID-prefixes of EIDs served by the ETR (those for which
      the router provides an RLOC translation).  These FIB entries are
      marked with a flag indicating that control-plane processing should
      be performed.  The forwarding logic of testing for particular IP
      protocol number value is not necessary.  No changes to existing,
      deployed hardware should be needed to support this.

   o  On an ITR, prepending a new IP header is as simple as adding more
      bytes to a MAC rewrite string and prepending the string as part of
      the outgoing encapsulation procedure.  Many routers that support
      GRE tunneling [RFC2784] or 6to4 tunneling [RFC3056] can already
      support this action.

   o  When a received packet's outer destination address contains an EID
      which is not intended to be forwarded on the routable topology
      (i.e.  LISP 1.5), the source address of a data packet or the
      router interface with which the source is associated (the
      interface from which it was received) can be associated with a VRF
      (Virtual Routing/Forwarding), in which a different (i.e. non-
      congruent) topology can be used to find EID-to-RLOC mappings.

8.  Deployment Scenarios

   This section will explore how and where ITRs and ETRs can be deployed
   and will discuss the pros and cons of each deployment scenario.
   There are two basic deployment tradeoffs to consider: centralized
   versus distributed caches and flat, recursive, or re-encapsulating
   tunneling.

   When deciding on centralized versus distributed caching, the
   following issues should be considered:

   o  Are the tunnel routers spread out so that the caches are spread
      across all the memories of each router?

   o  Should management "touch points" be minimized by choosing few
      tunnel routers, just enough for redundancy?

   o  In general, using more ITRs doesn't increase management load,
      since caches are built and stored dynamically.  On the other hand,
      more ETRs does require more management since EID-prefix-to-RLOC
      mappings need to be explicitly configured.

   When deciding on flat, recursive, or re-encapsulation tunneling, the
   following issues should be considered:

   o  Flat tunneling implements a single tunnel between source site and
      destination site.  This generally offers better paths between
      sources and destinations with a single tunnel path.

   o  Recursive tunneling is when tunneled traffic is again further
      encapsulated in another tunnel, either to implement VPNs or to
      perform Traffic Engineering.  When doing VPN-based tunneling, the
      site has some control since the site is prepending a new tunnel
      header.  In the case of TE-based tunneling, the site may have
      control if it is prepending a new tunnel header, but if the site's
      ISP is doing the TE, then the site has no control.  Recursive
      tunneling generally will result in suboptimal paths but at the
      benefit of steering traffic to resource available parts of the
      network.

   o  The technique of re-encapsulation ensures that packets only
      require one tunnel header.  So if a packet needs to be rerouted,
      it is first decapsulated by the ETR and then re-encapsulated with
      a new tunnel header using a new RLOC.

   The next sub-sections will describe where tunnel routers can reside
   in the network.

8.1.  First-hop/Last-hop Tunnel Routers

   By locating tunnel routers close to hosts, the EID-prefix set is at
   the granularity of an IP subnet.  So at the expense of more EID-
   prefix-to-RLOC sets for the site, the caches in each tunnel router
   can remain relatively small.  But caches always depend on the number
   of non-aggregated EID destination flows active through these tunnel
   routers.

   With more tunnel routers doing encapsulation, the increase in control
   traffic grows as well: since the EID-granularity is greater, more
   Map-Requests and replies are traveling between more routers.

   The advantage of placing the caches and databases at these stub
   routers is that the products deployed in this part of the network
   have better price-memory ratios then their core router counterparts.
   Memory is typically less expensive in these devices and fewer routes
   are stored (only IGP routes).  These devices tend to have excess
   capacity, both for forwarding and routing state.

   LISP functionality can also be deployed in edge switches.  These
   devices generally have layer-2 ports facing hosts and layer-3 ports
   facing the Internet.  Spare capacity is also often available in these
   devices as well.

8.2.  Border/Edge Tunnel Routers

   Using customer-edge (CE) routers for tunnel endpoints allows the EID
   space associated with a site to be reachable via a small set of RLOCs
   assigned to the CE routers for that site.

   This offers the opposite benefit of the first-hop/last-hop tunnel
   router scenario: the number of mapping entries and network management
   touch points are reduced, allowing better scaling.

   One disadvantage is that less of the network's resources are used to
   reach host endpoints thereby centralizing the point-of-failure domain
   and creating network choke points at the CE router.

   Note that more than one CE router at a site can be configured with
   the same IP address.  In this case an RLOC is an anycast address.
   This allows resilency between the CE routers.  That is, if a CE
   router fails, traffic is automatically routed to the other routers
   using the same anycast address.  However, this comes with the
   disadvantage where the site cannot control the entrance point when
   the anycast route is advertised out from all border routers.

8.3.  ISP Provider-Edge (PE) Tunnel Routers

   Use of ISP PE routers as tunnel endpoint routers gives an ISP control
   over the location of the egress tunnel endpoints.  That is, the ISP
   can decide if the tunnel endpoints are in the destination site (in
   either CE routers or last-hop routers within a site) or at other PE
   edges.  The advantage of this case is that two or more tunnel headers
   can be avoided.  By having the PE be the first router on the path to
   encapsulate, it can choose a TE path first, and the ETR can
   decapsulate and re-encapsulate for a tunnel to the destination end
   site.

   An obvious disadvantage is that the end site has no control over
   where its packets flow or the RLOCs used.

   As mentioned in earlier sections a combination of these scenarios is
   possible at the expense of extra packet header overhead, if both site
   and provider want control, then recursive or re-encapsulating tunnels
   are used.

9.  Multicast Considerations

   A multicast group address, as defined in the original Internet
   architecture is an identifier of a grouping of topologically
   independent receiver host locations.  The address encoding itself
   does not determine the location of the receiver(s).  The multicast
   routing protocol, and the network-based state the protocol creates,
   determines where the receivers are located.

   In the context of LISP, a multicast group address is both an EID and
   a Routing Locator.  Therefore, no specific semantic or action needs
   to be taken for a destination address, as it would appear in an IP
   header.  Therefore, a group address that appears in an inner IP
   header built by a source host will be used as the destination EID.
   And the outer IP header (the destination Routing Locator address),
   prepended by a LISP router, will use the same group address as the
   destination Routing Locator.

   Having said that, only the source EID and source Routing Locator
   needs to be dealt with.  Therefore, an ITR merely needs to put its
   own IP address in the source Routing Locator field when prepending
   the outer IP header.  This source Routing Locator address, like any
   other Routing Locator address MUST be globally routable.

   Therefore, an EID-to-RLOC mapping does not need to be performed by an
   ITR when a received data packet is a multicast data packet or when
   processing a source-specific Join (either by IGMPv3 or PIM).  But the
   source Routing Locator is decided by the multicast routing protocol
   in a receiver site.  That is, an EID to Routing Locator translation
   is done at control-time.

   Another approach is to have the ITR not encapsulate a multicast
   packet and allow the the host built packet to flow into the core even
   if the source address is allocated out of the EID namespace.  If the
   RPF-Vector TLV [RPFV] is used by PIM in the core, then core routers
   can RPF to the ITR (the Locator address which is injected into core
   routing) rather than the host source address (the EID address which
   is not injected into core routing).

10.  Security Considerations

   We believe that most of the security mechanisms will be part of the
   mapping database service when using control-plane procedures for
   obtaining EID-to-RLOC mappings.  For data-plane triggered mappings,
   as described in this specification, protection is provided against
   ETR spoofing by using Return- Routeability mechanisms evidenced by
   the use of a 6-byte Nonce field in the LISP encapsulation header.
   The nonce, coupled with the ITR accepting only solicited Map-Replies
   goes a long way towards providing decent authentication.

   LISP does not rely on a PKI infrastructure or a more heavy weight
   authentication system.  These systems challenge the scalability of
   LISP which was a primary design goal.

   DoS attack prevention will depend on implementations rate- limiting
   of Map-Requests and Map-Replies to the control-plane as well as rate-
   limiting the number of data triggered Map-Replies.

11.  Prototype Plans and Status

   The operator community has requested that the IETF take a practical
   approach to solving the scaling problems associated with global
   routing state growth.  This document offers a simple solution which
   is intended for use in a pilot program to gain experience in working
   on this problem.

   The authors hope that publishing this specification will allow the
   rapid implementation of multiple vendor prototypes and deployment on
   a small scale.  Doing this will help the community:

   o  Decide whether a new EID-to-RLOC mapping database infrastructure
      is needed or if a simple, UDP-based, data-triggered approach is
      flexible and robust enough.

   o  Experiment with provider-independent assignment of EIDs while at
      the same time decreasing the size of DFZ routing tables through
      the use of topologically-aligned, provider-based RLOCs.

   o  Determine whether multiple levels of tunneling can be used by ISPs
      to achieve their Traffic Engineering goals while simultaneously
      removing the more specific routes currently injected into the
      global routing system for this purpose.

   o  Experiment with mobility to determine if both acceptable
      convergence and session survivability properties can be scalably
      implemented to support both individual device roaming and site
      service provider changes.

   Here are a rough set of milestones:

   1.  Stabilize this draft by Summer 2007 Chicago IETF.

   2.  Start implementations to report on by Summer 2007 Chicago IETF.

   3.  Start pilot deployment between summer and fall IETFs.  Report on
       deployment at Fall 2007 Vancouver IETF.

   4.  Achieve multi-vendor interoperability by Fall 2007 Vancouver
       IETF.

   5.  Consider prototyping other database lookup schemes, be it DNS,
       DHTs, CONS, NERD, or other mechanisms by Fall 2007 IETF.

   As of this writing the following accomplishments have been achieved:
