              RSVP-TE Signaling For GMPLS Restoration LSP
              draft-gandhi-ccamp-gmpls-restoration-lsp-02


Abstract

   In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme
   needs to employ restoration LSP while keeping resources for the
   working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the network after the
   failure. This draft describes Resource reSerVation Protocol - Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling for GMPLS end-to-end recovery when
   using restoration LSP.

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Signaling for Restoration LSP  January 15, 2014


1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS to
   include support for different switching technologies [RFC3471]
   [RFC3473]. These switching technologies provide several protection
   schemes [RFC4426][RFC4427] (e.g., 1+1, 1:N and M:N). GMPLS RSVP-TE
   signaling has been extended to support various recovery schemes to
   establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) [RFC4872][RFC4873], typically
   working LSP and protecting LSP. [RFC4427] Section 7 specifies various
   schemes for GMPLS restoration.

   In GMPLS recovery schemes generally considered, restoration LSP is
   signaled after the failure has been detected and notified on the
   working LSP.  In non-revertive recovery mode, working LSP is assumed
   to be removed from the network before restoration LSP is signaled.
   For revertive recovery mode, a restoration LSP is signaled while
   working LSP and/or protecting LSP are not torn down in control plane
   due to a failure.  In transport networks, as working LSPs are
   typically signaled over a nominal path, service providers would like
   to keep resources associated with the working LSPs reserved. This is
   to make sure that the service (working LSP) can use the nominal path
   when the failure is repaired. Consequently, revertive recovery mode
   is usually preferred by recovery schemes used in transport networks.

   As defined in [RFC4872] and being considered in this draft, "fully
   dynamic rerouting switches normal traffic to an alternate LSP that is
   not even partially established only after the working LSP failure
   occurs. The new alternate route is selected at the LSP head-end node,
   it may reuse resources of the failed LSP at intermediate nodes and
   may include additional intermediate nodes and/or links."

   One example of the recovery scheme considered in this draft is 1+R
   recovery. The 1+R recovery is exemplified in Figure 1. In this
   example, working LSP on path A-B-C-Z is pre-established. Typically
   after a failure detection and notification on the working LSP, a
   second LSP on path A-H-I-J-Z is established as a restoration LSP.
   Unlike protection LSP, restoration LSP is signaled per need basis.


                        A --- B --- C --- Z
                         \               /
                           H --- I --- J

   During failure switchover with 1+R recovery scheme, in general,
   working LSP resources are not released and working and restoration
   LSPs coexist in the network. Nonetheless, working and restoration
   LSPs can share network resources. Typically when failure is recovered
   on the working LSP, restoration LSP is no longer required and torn
   down (e.g., revertive mode).

   Another example of the recovery scheme considered in this draft is
   1+1+R. In 1+1+R, a restoration LSP is signaled for the working LSP
   and/or the protecting LSP after the failure has been detected and
   notified on the working LSP or the protecting LSP. The 1+1+R recovery
   is exemplified in Figure 2. In this example, working LSP on path A-B-
   C-Z and protecting LSP on path A-D-E-F-Z are pre-established. After a
   failure detection and notification on a working LSP or protecting
   LSP, a third LSP on path A-H-I-J-Z is established as a restoration
   LSP. The restoration LSP in this case provides protection against a
   second order failure. Restoration LSP is torn down when the failure
   on the working or protecting LSP is repaired.

                         /               \
                        A --- B --- C --- Z
                         \               /
                           H --- I --- J


           Figure 2: An example of 1+1+R recovery scheme


   [RFC4872] Section 14 defines PROTECTION object for GMPLS recovery
   signaling. The PROTECTION object is used to identify primary and
   secondary LSPs using S bit and protecting and working LSPs using P
   bit. [RFC4872] and [RFC6689] define the usage of ASSOCIATION object
   for further associating GMPLS working and protecting LSPs. However,
   these existing methods do not specify how to identify restoration LSP
   when working/protecting LSPs are not torn down.

   This draft describes procedures for identifying the restoration LSP
   for GMPLS end-to-end recovery where working and protecting LSP
   resources are kept reserved after the failure.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Restoration LSP Signaling

3.1.  Signaling Procedure

  Where GMPLS recovery scheme needs to employ restoration LSP while
  keeping resources for the working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in
  the network, restoration LSP is signaled with ASSOCIATION object with
  the association ID set to the LSP ID of the LSP it is restoring. For
  example, when a restoration LSP is signaled for a working LSP, the
  ASSOCIATION object in the restoration LSP contains the association ID
  set to the LSP ID of the working LSP. Similarly, when a restoration
  LSP is signaled for a protecting LSP, the ASSOCIATION object in the
  restoration LSP contains the association ID set to the LSP ID of the
  protecting LSP.

  The procedure for signaling the PROTECTION object is specified in
  [RFC4872] and is changed by this document. Restoration LSP being used
  as a working LSP is signaled with P bit cleared and as a protecting
  LSP is signaled with P bit set.

  When using a GMPLS recovery mode, where the restoration LSP is
  promoted to be the new working LSP, restoration LSP RSVP Path message
  MUST be refreshed by using the ASSOCIATION_OBJECT.LSP_ID to contain
  the LSP ID of the protecting LSP if known or LSP ID of itself if
  protecting LSP is not known as defined in [RFC6689].

  When using a GMPLS recovery mode, where the restoration LSP is
  promoted to be the new protecting LSP, restoration LSP RSVP Path
  message MUST be refreshed by using the ASSOCIATIN_OBJECT.LSP_ID to
  contain the LSP ID of the working LSP if known or LSP ID of itself if
  working LSP is not known as defined in [RFC6689].
