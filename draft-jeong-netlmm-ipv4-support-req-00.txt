Internet-Draft   PMIPv6 IPv4 Support Requirements-Goals         Feb 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IETF NetLMM WG is developing standards of network-based mobility
   management in a localized domain.  [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-ps]
   summarizes the problems of the conventional host-based mobility
   management solutions as follows: 1) change of host-side software, 2)
   lack of simultaneously supporting both IPv4 and IPv6, and 3)
   additional security associations between network nodes and mobile
   nodes.

   Network-based localized mobility management is expected to be one of
   the prominent ways in order to provide IP mobility to mobile nodes,
   because it does not require additional software on the mobile node.

   In [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-req], 11 goals for localized mobility
   management are described.  Among them, following goal is not yet
   actively discussed in the mailing list.

    - Support for IPv4 and IPv6 (Goal #8):  This goal describes
      considerations for deploying NetLMM architecture to not only IPv4
      infrastructure, but also IPv6 infrastructure.

   Current network-based localized mobility management solutions
   proposed by NetLMM WG are designed with IPv6 infrastructure and IPv6
   (or dual stack) mobile nodes in mind [I-D.singh-netlmm-protocol]
   [I-D.sgundave-mip6-proxymip6].

   However, localized mobility management in IPv4 infrastructure is also
   problematic and as the NetLMM architecture being more widely used, it
   will be likely to introduce the NetLMM architecture to IPv4 networks.
   Also, there still exist a lot of IPv4 MNs and these IPv4 MNs may
   visit PMIPv6 domain.  Further, dual stack or IPv4 MN in the PMIPv6
   domain could communicate with IPv4 CNs.

1.1.  Possible Scenarios of IPv4 Support in PMIPv6

   IPv4 MN support - When an IPv4 MN moves from IPv4 network to a PMIPv6
   domain, the PMIPv6 domain is required to detect an attachment of IPv4
   MN and to maintain the MN's connectivity with IPv4 CNs.

   IPv4 infrastructure support - The dual stacked PMIPv6 components may
   be deployed a network where both IPv4 and IPv6 infrastructure coexist
   or where the network infrastructure still support IPv4 but it is
   expected that the network will be migrated to IPv6 soon.  In this
   scenario, PMIPv6 signaling messages will be transported through IPv4
   encapsulation.

   IPv4 CN support - The PMIPv6 components are reachable through a

   globally unique IPv4 address so that IPv4 or dual stack MNs in the
   PMIPv6 domain can communicate with IPv4 CNs.


2.  Goals of IPv4 support in PMIPv6

   o  Current PMIPv6 protocols mainly consider IPv6 or dual stack MNs.
      However, there still exist many IPv4 MNs.  When an IPv4 MNs visits
      a PMIPv6 domain, the PMIPv6 domain should detect the IPv4 MN's
      attachment and should enable the IPv4 MN to communicate with IPv4
      CNs.

   o  IPv6 offers many improvements over IPv4 and MIPv6 also improves
      MIPv4.  Although transition from IPv4 to IPv6 occurs in slow
      phase, the transition would happen eventually.  During the
      transition period from IPv4 to IPv6, IPv4 and IPv6 infrastructure
      may coexist in a network.  In such environment, dual stacked
      PMIPv6 components are likely to be deployed in order to support
      network-based localized mobility in the network where the large
      part of the network infrastructure is supporting IPv4.

      Therefore, in order to deploy PMIPv6 in such network, it is needed
      to consider deploying PMIPv6 in the IPv4 network infrastructure.
      The PMIPv6 signaling will be carried in IPv4 data tunnel.

   o  When dual stack or IPv4 MN is attached to a PMIPv6 domain, the MN
      may communicate with both IPv6 and IPv4 CNs while the MN is in a
      PMIPv6 supporting domain (IPv6 or IPv4 infrastructure).  Thus, the
      PMIPv6 domain should support data tunneling in order to carry IPv4
      traffic to the MN.


3.  Requirements of IPv4 support in PMIPv6

   o  If a MN wants to communicate with both IPv4 and IPv6 CN, the MN
      should be dual stacked.

   o  When an IPv4 MN moves into a PMIPv6 domain, PMIPv6 components
      should detect the MN's attachment.  PMIPv6 components should be
      dual stacked in order to detect the attachment of IPv4 and/or dual
      stack MN.

   o  A dual stack or IPv4 MN has IPv4 address, if the MN communicates
      with IPv4 CNs.  If the MN does not have IPv4 address yet, PMIPv6
      domain should support allocation of IP address.

Internet-Draft   PMIPv6 IPv4 Support Requirements-Goals         Feb 2007


   o  The LMA in a PMIPv6 domain is reachable through globally unique
      IPv4 address, if the PMIPv6 domain support a IPv4 (or dual stack)
      MN to communicate with IPv4 CNs.

   o  It should be possible for an access router in PMIPv6 domain to
      register MN's IPv4 address with the LMA using PMIPv6 signaling
      messages.

   o  When PMIPv6 is deployed in the IPv6 infrastructure, PMIPv6
      components should support IPv4-in-IPv6 data tunneling in order to
      transport IPv4 traffic over IPv6 infrastructure.  When PMIPv6 is
      deployed in the IPv4 infrastructure, PMIPv6 components should
      support IPv6-in-IPv4 data tunneling in order to deliver IPv6
      traffic over IPv4 infrastructure.

   o  When an IPv6 network where PMIPv6 is deployed supports IPv4 MNs,
      PMIPv6 components should maintain two routing tables IPv4 and
      IPv6, respectively.  When an IPv4 network where PMIPv6 is deployed
      supports dual stack MN that communicates with IPv6 CNs, PMIPv6
      components should maintain both IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No action is required by IANA for this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   The attachment of an IPv4 MN to a PMIPv6 domain with IPv6
   infrastructure or a dual stack MN to a PMIPv6 domain with IPv4
   infrastructure may introduce security threats in the PMIPv6 domain.
   Thus, access routers are required to perform authentication of MN
   before registering the MN to the LMA.
