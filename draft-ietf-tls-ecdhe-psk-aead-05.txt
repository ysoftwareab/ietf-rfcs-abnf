  ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites for Transport Layer
                  Security (TLS) Protocol version 1.2
                    draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-psk-aead-05

Abstract

   This document defines several new cipher suites for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2.  The cipher suites are all
   based on the Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with Pre-Shared
   Key (ECDHE_PSK) key exchange together with the Authenticated
   Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms AES-GCM and AES-
   CCM.  PSK provides light and efficient authentication, ECDHE provides
   forward secrecy, and AES-GCM and AES-CCM provides encryption and
   integrity protection.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This document defines new cipher suites that provide Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) authentication, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).  The cipher
   suites are defined for version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol and version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport
   Layer Security (DTLS) protocol [RFC6347].

   Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication is widely used in many scenarios.
   One deployment is 3GPP networks where pre-shared keys are used to
   authenticate both subscriber and network.  Another deployment is
   Internet of Things where PSK authentication is often preferred for
   performance and energy efficiency reasons.  In both scenarios the
   endpoints are owned/controlled by a party that provisions the pre-
   shared keys and makes sure that they provide a high level of entropy.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a strongly recommended feature in
   security protocol design and can be accomplished by using an
   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.  Ephemeral Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) provides PFS with excellent performance
   and small key sizes.  ECDHE is mandatory to implement in both HTTP/2
   [RFC7540] and CoAP [RFC7252].

Internet-Draft               ECDHE_PSK_AEAD                     May 2017


   AEAD algorithms that combine encryption and integrity protection are
   strongly recommended for (D)TLS [RFC7525] and non-AEAD algorithms are
   forbidden to use in TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  The AEAD
   algorithms considered in this document are AES-GCM and AES-CCM.  The
   use of AES-GCM in TLS is defined in [RFC5288] and the use of AES-CCM
   is defined in [RFC6655].

   [RFC4279] defines Pre-Shared Key (PSK) cipher suites for TLS but does
   not consider Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  [RFC4492] introduces
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography for TLS but does not consider PSK
   authentication.  [RFC5487] describes the use of AES-GCM in
   combination with PSK authentication, but does not consider ECDHE.
   [RFC5489] describes the use of PSK in combination with ECDHE but does
   not consider AES-GCM or AES-CCM.

3.  ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites

   The cipher suites defined in this document are based on the AES-GCM
   and AES-CCM Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)
   algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM, AEAD_AES_256_GCM, AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8
   defined in [RFC6655] and AEAD_AES_128_CCM defined in [RFC5116].

   Messages and premaster secret construction in this document are
   defined in [RFC5489].  The ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange
   messages are used and the premaster secret is computed as for the
   ECDHE_PSK key exchange.  The elliptic curve parameters used in in the
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are negotiated using extensions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4492bis].

   For TLS 1.2, the following cipher suites are defined:

   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xTBD,0xTBD};
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xTBD,0xTBD};
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 = {0xTBD,0xTBD};
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256   = {0xTBD,0xTBD};

   The assigned code points can only be used for TLS 1.2.

   The cipher suites defined in this document MUST NOT be negotiated for
   any version of (D)TLS other than TLS 1.2.  Servers MUST NOT select
   one of these cipher suites when selecting TLS version other than TLS
   1.2.  A client MUST treat the selection of these cipher suites in
   combination with a different version of TLS as an error and generate
   a fatal 'illegal_parameter' TLS alert.

   Cipher suites TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
   TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 and TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 are used to
   support equivalent functionality in TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new cipher suites, whose values
   have been assigned in the TLS Cipher Suite Registry defined by
   [RFC5246].

   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xTBD; 0xTBD} {0xD0,0x01};
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xTBD; 0xTBD} {0xD0,0x02};
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 = {0xTBD; 0xTBD} {0xD0,0x03};
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256   = {0xTBD; 0xTBD} {0xD0,0x05};

   NOTE TO THE RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THIS PARAGRAPH.  The cipher
   suite numbers listed in the last column are numbers used for cipher
   suite interoperability testing and it's suggested that IANA use these
   values for assignment.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347],
   PSK Ciphersuites for TLS [RFC4279], ECDHE_PSK [RFC5489], AES-GCM
   [RFC5288], and AES-CCM [RFC6655] apply to this document as well.

   All the cipher suites defined in this document provide
   confidentiality, mutual authentication, and forward secrecy.  The
   AES-128 cipher suites provide 128-bit security and the AES-256 cipher
   suites provide at least 192-bit security.  However, AES_128_CCM_8
   only provides 64-bit security against message forgery.

   The Pre-Shared Keys used for authentication MUST have a security
   level equal or higher than the cipher suite used, i.e., at least
   128-bit for the AES-128 cipher suites and at least 192-bit for the
   AES-256 cipher suites.

   GCM or CCM encryption - even of different clear text - re-using a
   nonce with a same key undermines the security of GCM and CCM.  As a
   result, GCM and CCM MUST only be used with a system guaranteeing
   nonce uniqueness [RFC5116].
