Abstract

   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This
   document has been defined to provide the a definition of a MIME
   message format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling
   information across the Internet.

   This memo is meant to serve as the basis for registration of such a
   MIME media type per [RFC1521]. The proposed media type value is
   "TEXT/CALENDAR". This string would label a media type containing
   calendaring and scheduling information encoded as text characters
   formatted in a manner outlined below.

   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event and todo information. It also can be used to convey
   free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME
   message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems
   or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object
   for interactions between desktop applications using the operating
   system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

   It is expected that additional documents will be created for this
   content type that define usage profiles for specific sets of

   calendaring and scheduling capabilities. The format for these profile
   documents is also defined by this document.

   The document is also intended to serve as a standard for message
   profiles that will provide an interoperability method for exchanging
   over the Internet event-requests, reply to event-requests,
   modification notices for event requests, cancellation notices for
   event-requests, todo-requests, reply to todo-requests, modification
   notices for todo requests, cancellation notices for todo-requests,
   requesting free/busy time and replying to free/busy time requests
   between different calendaring and scheduling products. This is the
   subject of another Internet Draft.

1. Introduction

   The use of mail enabled applications such as calendaring and
   scheduling has grown considerably in the last decade. Enterprise and
   inter-enterprise business has become dependent on rapid scheduling of
   events and actions using this information technology. The store-and-
   forward characteristic of electronic messaging technologies has been
   shown to be complementary to the asynchronous nature of group
   communications. However, the longer term growth of mail enabled
   applications, such as calendaring and scheduling, is currently
   limited by the lack of Internet standards for the message content
   types that are central to these groupware applications. This
   specification is intended to progress the level of interoperability
   possible between dissimilar calendaring and scheduling applications
   that communicate using an SMTP or MIME transport.

   This specification defines a MIME content type for exchanging
   electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type allows for the capture and
   exchange of information normally stored within a calendaring and
   scheduling application; such as a Personal Information Manager or a
   Group Scheduling product.

   The format is suitable as an exchange format between applications or
   systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME content type. The
   primary transport for this exchange is expected to be a MIME
   electronic messaging system. However, other transports such as HTTP,
   a file system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a
   memory-based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point
   asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of
   unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.

   The specification also provides for the definition of usage profiles
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments and todos. The
   usage profiles can be used to define other calendaring and scheduling
   operations such a requesting for and replying with free/busy time
   data.

   The specification also includes a formal grammar for the content type
   to aid in the implementation of parsers and to serve as the
   definitive reference when ambiguities or questions arise in
   interpreting the descriptive prose definition of the specification.

2. TEXT/CALENDAR Registration Information

     To: ietf-types@uninett.no

     Subject: Registration of MIME content type text/calendar.

     MIME media type name: text

     MIME subtype name: calendar

     Required parameters: PROFILE

     Optional parameters: CHARSET

     Additional required content header fields: CONTENT-ID, MESSAGE-ID

     Optional content header fields: CONTENT-LANGUAGE, TRANSFER-ENCODING

     Encoding considerations: This MIME content type does not introduce
     any new encoding considerations beyond those defined in [RFC 1521].

     Security considerations: The calendaring and scheduling information
     based on this MIME content type may include references to Uniform
     Resource Locators that may be programmed resources. In addition,
     this information may contain direct references to executable
     programs intended to be used as program-based alarms for an event
     or todo. Implementers and users of this specification should be
     aware of the network security implications of accepting and parsing
     such information.

     Interoperability considerations: This MIME content type is intended
     to provide interoperability between calendaring and scheduling
     products. It is heavily based on the prior [VCAL] specification in
     order to assure interoperability with implementations conforming to
     this industry specification.

3. Intended Use

   This memo is meant to serve as the basis for registration of a MIME
   content type per [RFC1521]. It is defined using the MIME content type
   registration from [MIME-REG]. The proposed content type value is
   "TEXT/CALENDAR". This string would label a media type containing
   calendaring and scheduling information encoded primarily as text
   characters formatted in a manner outlined below.

   A subtype of the standard MIME _TEXT_ media type was chosen as the
   form for this content type because it provides a known and reasonable
   fallback for legacy systems that are required in an enterprise that
   also includes MIME based user agents that support this content type.
   Legacy systems that do not understand the _TEXT/CALENDAR_ content
   type will render these MIME entities as they would _TEXT/PLAIN_
   content type. This will provide a minimal level of support for
   calendaring and scheduling information in legacy systems (i.e., the
   ability to display the text tagged calendaring and scheduling content
   information). This is a vital requirement for any mail enabled,
   enterprise application; as there are still over 7 million existing
   legacy electronic mail user agents at this time.

   The calendaring and scheduling media type is specified as an
   independent content type in order that it can be conveyed as a single
   MIME message entity or as one MIME entity in a multi-part MIME
   message. Additionally, the calendaring and scheduling information may
   be defined in a multi-part message containing references to other
   MIME body parts holding additional data related to the event, todo,
   or free/busy time information.

3.1 Published specification

   The following characteristics are specific to this MIME content type.

3.1.1 Existing Message Header Fields

   The MIME Calendar Content Type may utilize any of the message header
   fields defined by [RFC 822], [RFC 1521], and [RFC 1766]. A number of
   these message header fields are especially useful to the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type. These include the following
   header fields defined in either [RFC 822], [RFC 1521], and [RFC
   1766].

3.1.1.1 Content-Type Header Field

   The [RFC 1521] Content-Type header field is used to identify the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type. The value of this property
   must be _text/calendar_ in order to correspond to the media type
   defined by this document. This header field is required for MIME
   entities conforming to this content type.

3.1.1.1.1 CHARSET Header Field Parameter




Dawson                             6                  Expires June 1997


Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   The [RFC 1521] CHARSET Content-Type header field parameter is used to
   identify an alternate character set to the default US-ASCII used by
   the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type. This header field
   parameter is optional for MIME entities conforming to this content
   type.

3.1.1.2 Content-ID Header Field

   The [RFC 1521] Content-ID header field is used to provide a
   persistent, globally unique identifier for a MIME Calendar Object
   within a MIME message entity. This header field is required for MIME
   entities conforming to this content type.

3.1.1.3 Content-Language

   The [RFC 1766] Content-Language header field is used to provide an
   alternate default language for the MIME Calendar Object. The default
   language is _en-US_. This header field is optional for MIME entities
   conforming to this content type.

3.1.1.4 Message-ID Header Field

   The [RFC 1521] Message-ID header field is used to provide a
   persistent, globally unique identifier for a MIME message containing
   a single body part consisting of a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type. This header field is required for a single body part
   MIME message conforming to this content type.

3.1.1.5 Transfer-Encoding Header Field

   The [RFC 1521] Transfer-Encoding header filed is used to provide an
   alternate transfer encoding for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type. The default transfer encoding is _7BIT_. This header
   field is optional for a MIME entity conforming to this content type.

3.1.2 Additional Content Type Parameter

   In addition to the existing content type parameters defined by [RFC
   1521] and [RFC 1766], this document defines an additional content
   type parameter to be used by the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type.

3.1.2.1 Profile

   The MIME Calendar Object defines the Profile content type parameter.
   This parameter is used to specify a usage profile for the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type. The value of this parameter
   consists of a type and a subtype value pair. The type value is used
   to specify either a EVENT, TODO, or FREE-BUSY type of MIME Calendar
   Object profile. The subtype value is used to specify the scheduling
   operation being conveyed by the profile type. The EVENT and TODO type
   values may have a subtype value of REQUEST, to convey an event or
   todo request message, REPLY, to convey an event or todo reply
   message, MODIFY, to convey an event or todo modification message,


Dawson                             7                  Expires June 1997


Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   CANCEL, to convey an event or todo cancellation message, DELEGATE, to
   convey an event or todo delegation message. The BUSY-FREE type value
   may have a subtype value of REQUEST, to convey a free-busy time
   request message , or REPLY, to convey a free-busy time data message.
   The parameter value is defined by the following BNF:

     profile := ((_EVENT  /                         _   _    _                             TODO ) _/_ type1) / (_FREE-BUSY_ _/_ type2)

     type1 :=   _REQUEST_ / _REPLY_ / _MODIFY_ / _CANCEL_ / _DELEGATE_

     type2 :=   _REQUEST_ / _REPLY_

   The following is an example of this content type parameter for
   specifying an event request message, such as in a request for a
   meeting or appointment:

     CONTENT-TYPE:TEXT/CALENDAR;PROFILE=EVENT/REQUEST

   The following is an example of this content type parameter for
   specifying a todo delegation message, such as delegating a task to
   another individual:

     CONTENT-TYPE:TEXT/CALENDAR;TODO/DELEGATE

   The following is an example of this content type parameter for
   specifying a free-busy time request, such as when searching for a
   free time for a meeting:

     CONTENT-TYPE:TEXT/CALENDAR;PROFILE=FREE-BUSY/REQUEST

   This content type parameter is required for MIME entities conforming
   to this content type.

3.1.3 Content Syntax Considerations

   The following general considerations are specific to the syntax used
   to format the text of the body information for this content type.

3.1.3.1 Property

   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing an
   event or a todo associated with the MIME Calendar Object. A property
   takes the following form:

     property :=        propname *(_;_ propparm) _:_ propvalue

   as shown in the following example:

     DTSTART:19960415T083000

   A property takes the form of one or more lines of text. The
   specification of property names and property parameters is case
   insensitive. The property name can be one of a set of pre-defined or
   non-standard strings. The property name must appear as the first


Dawson                             8                  Expires June 1997


Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   characters on a line. In the previous example, _DTSTART_ is the name
   of the Start Date/Time property. Property values are specified as
   strings. In the previous example, _19960415T083000_ is the ISO 8601
   formatted value for the Start Date/Time property.

   The property parameter expressions are specified as either a
   name=value or a value string. The parameter value string can be
   specified alone in those cases where the value is unambiguous. For
   example a complete property parameter specification might be:

     DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Don't forget to order Girl=
      Scout cookies from Stacey today!

   A valid short version of the same property parameter specification
   might be:

     DESCRIPTION;QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Don't forget to order Girl=
      Scout cookies from Stacey today!

3.1.3.2 Delimiters

   Individual lines within the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content
   Type body are delimited by the [RFC 822] line break, which is a CRLF
   sequence (ASCII decimal 13, followed by ASCII decimal 10). Long lines
   of text can be split into a multiple-line representation using the
   RFC 822 _folding_ technique. That is, wherever there may be linear
   white space (NOT simply LWSP-chars), a CRLF immediately followed by
   at least one LWSP-char may instead be inserted. For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description
       that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
   of a property definition to its single line representation is called
   _unfolding_. Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately
   followed by a LWSP-char as equivalent to the LWSP-char.

   It is recommended that folding be limited to higher-level syntactic
   breaks in structured components of the property definition.

   A formatted text line break in a property value, must also be
   specified by a (RFC 822) line break, which is a CRLF sequence.
   However, since the CRLF sequence is used to delimit a line, property
   values with formatted line breaks (i.e., multiple lines) must be
   encoded using an alternate encoding of either Quoted-Printable or
   Base64, as defined in [RFC 1521].

   For example, in the Quoted-Printable encoding the multiple lines of
   formatted text are separated with a Quoted-Printable CRLF sequence of
   _=0D_ followed by _=0A_ followed by a Quoted-Printable soft line


Dawson                             9                  Expires June 1997


Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   break sequence of _=_. Quoted-Printable lines of text must also be
   limited to less than 76 characters. The 76 characters does not
   include the CRLF [RFC 822] line break sequence. For example a
   multiple line DESCRIPTION value of:

     Project XYZ Final Review
     Conference Room - 3B
     Come Prepared.

   Would be represented in a Quoted-Printable encoding as:

     DESCRIPTION; QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Project XYZ Final Review=0D=0A=
     Conference Room - 3B=0D=0A=
     Come Prepared.

   Property parameter sub-strings are delimited by a field delimiter,
   specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-
   colon character in a property parameter value must be escaped with a
   Backslash character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Compound property values are delimited by a field delimiter,
   specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-
   colon character in a component of a compound property value must be
   escaped with a Backslash character (ASCII decimal 92).

3.1.3.3 Property Value Transfer Encoding

   The default transfer encoding for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type is _7BIT_. The default transfer encoding can be
   overridden for an individual property value by using the _ENCODING_
   property parameter. This parameter value can be either _7BIT_,
   _BASE64_, _QUOTED-PRINTABLE_, or _8BIT_. This parameter may be used
   on any property.

   The MIME TRANSFER-ENCODING header field can be used to specify a
   default transfer encoding other than 7BIT (e.g., 8BIT).

3.1.3.4 Property Value Character Set

   The default character set for a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type is ASCII. The default character set can be overridden
   for an individual property value by using the _CHARSET_ property
   parameter. This property parameter may be used on any property.
   However, the use of this parameter on some properties may not make
   sense.

   Any character set registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) can be specified by this property parameter. For
   example, ISO 8859-8 or the Latin/Hebrew character set is specified
   by:

     DESCRIPTION;CHARSET=ISO-8859-8:...

   The MIME CHARSET parameter on the CONTENT-TYPE header field can be
   used to specify a default character set other than ASCII (e.g., UTF-
   8).

3.1.3.5 Property Value Language

   The default language for a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content
   Type is _en-US_ (US English). The default language can be overridden
   for an individual property value by using the _LANGUAGE_ property
   parameter. The values for this property are a string consistent with
   RFC 1766, Tags for the Identification of Languages. This property
   parameter may be used on any property. However, the use of this
   parameter on some properties, such as PHOTO, LOGO, SOUND, TEL, may
   not make sense. Canadian French would be specified by this property
   parameter by the following:

     SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=fr-CA:...

   The MIME LANGUAGE parameter on the CONTENT-TYPE header field can be
   used to specify a default language other than US English (e.g., fr-
   CA).

3.1.3.6 Property Value Data Type

   In order to more fully specify the semantics of this content type and
   to facilitate its automated processing, the specification of each
   property defined by the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   identifies the valid data types and the default data type for the
   property value. In addition, within an instance of this content type
   a property may explicitly convey the data type information through
   the DATATYPE property parameter. The STRING data type for the
   DESCRIPTION property would be specified by the following:

     DESCRIPTION;DATATYPE=STRING:Weekly Staff Meeting

   If the DATATYPE property parameter is not specified on a property,
   then the default data type for that property is assumed. Usage
   profiles for this content type that introduce new properties must
   specify the default data type for each newly defined property. The
   data types used within this content type definition include the
   following:

              Locator string.



   The property values consisting of lists of a particular data type
   (i.e., STRING-LIST) are semi-colon separated string of list items.

3.1.3.7 Date and Time

   The date and time values for all MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type properties are formatted as a string consistent with the
   ISO 8601 representation for combinations of dates and times. Either
   the basic or extended format is allowed. The use of UTC, rather than
   local time, should be used when ever possible in order to avoid time
   zone ambiguities. Where local time is specified, the inclusion of the
   UTC offset should also be included to avoid time zone ambiguities.
   The format for the complete, representation of a date and time value
   is represented by the following ABNF:

     date-time =        1*(date / time / (date time))


     date =     year month day
     year =     <four digits representing the century and year>
     month =    [_-_] <digits representing the month in the year>
     day =      [_-_] <digits representing the day of the month>

     time =     hour minute second [fraction] (utc-sign / utc-offset)
     hour =     <digits representing a period of time of 60 minutes>
     minute =   [_:] <digits representing a period of time of 60
                seconds>
     second =   [_:_] <digits representing a basic measurement unit
                of time in the International System of Units as defined
                in ISO 31-1>
     fraction = _,_ <digits representing fraction of a second>

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


     utc-sign = _Z_
     utc-offset = [_+_ / _-_] hour [_:_] minute
        ;_+_ if offset is after UTC and _-_ if offset is before UTC

   The basic complete representation does not include the _-_ date
   separator nor the _:_ time separator. The extended complete
   representation does include the separators.

   For example, 8:30 AM on April 15, 1996 local time EST would be
   written as:

     19960415T083000-05:00

   And the same time in UTC based time would be written as:

     19960415T133000Z

   The same date and time represented in the extended completed
   representation would be written as:

     1996-04-15T08:30:00-05:00

   And the same time in UTC based time would be written as:

     1996-04-15T13:30:00Z

   Where a value needs to specify a sequence of date and time values,
   then the property value is a string made up of a list of date and
   time values, separated by the field separator, a Semi-Colon (ASCII
   decimal 59). For example:

     19960101T090000Z;19960201T090000Z;19960301T090000Z;...

3.1.3.8 Time Duration

   The values for time duration or periods of time for all MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type properties are formatted as a
   string consistent with the ISO 8601 representation for duration of
   time. A given duration of a period of time is represented by a
   character string consisting of the designator _P_, optionally
   including the number of years followed by the designator _Y_,
   optionally including the number of months followed by the designator
   _M_, optionally including the number of weeks followed by the
   designator _W_, optionally including the number of days followed by
   the designator _D_. The sequence can also contain a time component
   preceded by the designator _T_, optionally including the number of
   hours followed by the designator _H_, optionally including the number
   of minutes followed by the designator _M_, optionally including the
   number of seconds followed by the designator _S_. The following ABNF
   describes the representation of ISO 8601 periods of time:

     duration = _P_ (yr-period / tm-period / (yr-period tm-period))
        ;Duration needs to include at least one component of year or
        ;time periods

     yr-period =        [yr-parm] [mo-parm] / wk-parm
     yr-parm =          _Y_ <digits representing the number of years>
     mo-parm =          _M_ <digits representing the number of months>
     wk-parm =          _W_ <digits representing the number of weeks>

     tm-period =        _T_ [hr-parm] [mn-parm] [sc-parm]
     hr-parm =          _H_ <digits representing the number of hours>
     mn-parm =          _M_ <digits representing the number of minutes>
     sc-parm =          _S_ <digits representing the number of seconds>

   For example:

     P6W

   represents a period of six weeks;

     PT15M

   represents a period of 15 minutes;

     PT1H30M

   represents a period of 1 hour and thirty minutes; or

     P2Y10M15DT10H30M20S

   represents a period of 2 years, 10 months, 15 days, 10 hours, 30
   minutes, and 20 seconds.

3.1.3.9 Value Location

   The default location of the property values is inline with the
   property. However, for some properties, such as those that specify
   multimedia values, it is more efficient in a MIME message to organize
   the property value as a separate MIME entity. The property parameter
   _VALUE_ can be specified to override the _INLINE_ location of the
   property value. In the case of the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type being transported within a MIME email message, the
   property value can be specified as being located in a separate MIME
   entity with the _CONTENT-ID_ value; or _CID_ for shorthand. In this
   case, the property value is the Content-ID for the MIME entity within
   the multi-part message that contains the property value. The value
   can also be specified as being contained within an another, external
   message using the _MESSAGE-ID_ value, or _MID_ for shorthand. In
   addition, the property value can be specified as being located out on
   the Internet using the _URL_ value. In this case, the property value
   is the Uniform Resource Locator for the Internet resource containing
   the property value. This property parameter may be used on any
   property. However, the use of this parameter on some properties may
   not make sense; for example the Version, Time Zone, Status, Priority,
   Mail Reminder, etc. properties.

   The following specifies a value located out on the Internet:

     ATTACH;VALUE=URL:http://www.abc.com/dir_photos/my_photo.gif

   The following specifies a value located out in the content of another
   message:

     ATTACH;VALUE=MID:<960120.aaCB@host1.com>

3.1.3.10 Binary Property Values

   The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type supports inclusion
   of binary information, such as computer graphic images (e.g.,
   IMAGE/JPEG), digital audio (e.g., AUDIO/BASIC), or video graphic
   images (e.g., VIDEO/MPEG). As specified above the binary information
   can be referenced with a Uniform Reference Locator (URL), referenced
   within an external MIME message, referenced within a particular MIME
   message body part, or placed. Inline binary information is included
   as a property value after being binary encoded using Base 64
   (default) or Quoted-Printable transfer encoding.

3.1.3.11 Recurrence Rule Grammar

   Recurring events within the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content
   Type may be specified as either a list of discrete date and time
   values or as a recurrence rule using a grammar. The basic recurrence
   rule grammar used by this specification is defined in a separate
   section of this specification. The grammar defines a recurrence rule
   that that is based on the prior work of the X.400 API Association's
   Calendaring and Scheduling Subcommittee. It is also based on prior
   work of the IETF Chronos Working Group. Refer to section 3.3.

3.1.4 Body Delimiter Properties

   The body information of a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content
   Type is defined by a series of body fields or properties. This
   section defines the properties that can be used in MIME entities
   conforming to this content type.

3.1.4.1 Calendar Object

   The body of the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type is
   identified within the body of a MIME entity by the appearance of the
   Begin Calendar Object Delimiter:

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR

   The sentinel string must appear as the first characters in the body
   of the MIME entity and as the first characters on a line.

   The body information of the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content
   Type is terminated by the appearance of the End Calendar Object
   Delimiter as the first characters on a line:

     END:VCALENDAR

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type is a container for
   calendar components. These can include either event or todo
   components. The body of a MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content
   Type will generally contain a single calendar event or todo
   component. However, the body may include multiple event or todo
   components. This is the case for free-busy time reply messages that
   contain multiple free time intervals in individual calendar
   components.

   The Begin and End Calendar Object Delimiter properties are required
   in a MIME entity conforming to this content type. The default data
   type for these properties is a STRING.

3.1.4.2 Event Component

   An Event Component is a grouping of calendaring and scheduling
   properties that defines a component that represents a scheduled
   amount of time on a calendar. For example, it may be an activity;
   such as a one-hour, department meeting from 8 AM to 9 AM, tomorrow or
   a free/busy time interval.

   An individual Event Component is identified within a MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type by the appearance of the delimiter:

     BEGIN:VEVENT

   The sentinel string must appear as the first characters on a line.

   The Event Component is terminated with the appearance of the
   following delimiter string as the first characters on a line

     END:VEVENT

   The Event Component can not be nested within another Event or Todo
   Component. If Event components need to be related to each other or to
   a Todo Component, they can specify a relationship with the RELATED-TO
   property.

   The Begin and End Event Component Delimiter properties are required
   for a MIME entity containing an event component and conforming to
   this content type. The default data type for these properties is a
   STRING.

3.1.4.3 Todo Component

   A Todo Component is a grouping of calendaring and scheduling
   properties that define a component that represents an action-item or
   assignment. For example, it may be an item of work assigned to an
   individual; such as _turn in travel expense today_.

   An individual Todo Component is identified within a MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type by the appearance of the delimiter:

     BEGIN:VTODO

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   The sentinel string must appear as the first characters on a line.

   The Todo Component is terminated with the appearance of the following
   delimiter string as the first characters on a line

     END:VTODO

   The Todo Component can not be nested within another Todo or Event
   Component. If Todo components need to be related to each other or to
   an Event Component, they can specify a relationship with the RELATED-
   TO property.

   The Begin and End Todo Component Delimiter properties are required
   for a MIME entity containing a todo component and conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for these properties is a STRING.

3.1.5 Calendar Object Properties

   The following properties may appear between the Begin Calendar Object
   Delimiter and either the Begin Event Component Delimiter or the Begin
   Todo Component Delimiter. These properties define body field values
   that apply to the complete calendar object.

3.1.5.1 Calendar Content Profile

   This property is identified by the property name PROFILE. This
   property defines the usage profile associated with the calendar
   object. When used included in a MIME message entity, the value of
   this property MUST be the same as the Content-Type profile parameter
   value.

   The calendar property value may include the following usage profile
   values:


              Profile Parameter     Description
              Type/Subtype Value


              EVENT/REQUEST         Make a request for an
                                    event

3.1.5.2 Daylight Savings Rule

   This property is identified by the property name DAYLIGHT. This
   property defines the daylight savings time rule observed by the
   _home_ calendar system that created the MIME calendar object.

   Many locations adjust their standard time forward or backward by one
   hour, in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of daylight
   hours. Some locations adjust their time by a fraction of an hour.
   Standard time is also known as Winter Time. Daylight savings time is
   also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain
   countries.

   The property value consists of a sequence of components that define a
   rule for the observance of daylight savings time. The value consists
   of the daylight savings time flag, followed by the daylight savings
   time offset, followed by the date and time that the daylight savings
   time begins, followed by the date and time that the daylight savings
   time ends, followed by the standard time designation, followed by the
   daylight savings time designation. The daylight savings time flag is

   owner intends for information within an individual calendar entry.
   The access classification of an individual MIME calendaring entity is
   useful when measured along with the other security components of a
   calendar system (e.g., user authorization, access rights, access
   role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual access
   classifications can not be completely defined by this specification.
   Additionally, due to the _blind_ nature of most exchange processes
   using this specification, these entity classifications can not serve
   as an enforcement statement for a system receiving a MIME calendar
   object . Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of
   the calendar owner for the access to the MIME calendar object
   component.

   The following is an example of this property:

     CLASS:PUBLIC

   The property can have the following values:




              Description           Property
                                    Value

   While this property has many useful purposes, implementers should be
   aware of the security implications of sending a MIME calendaring
   entity containing this property. The security implications are
   similar to those associated with active messages within electronic
   mail.

   The value for the procedure reminder consists of the Run Time, or the
   date and time that the reminder is to be executed; Snooze Time, or
   the duration of time after the Run Time that the reminder is to be
   dormant prior to being repeated; Repeat Count, or the number of times
   that the reminder is to be repeated; and the Procedure Name, or the
   path to the procedure to be run when the reminder is executed.
   Parameters are passed to the procedure by concatenating to the
   Procedure Name value a Question-Mark (ASCII decimal 63) followed by a
   string representation of the parameters.

   data type may alternatively be specified to be CID, MID, or URL.

3.1.6.21 Related To

   This property is identified by the property name RELATED-TO. The
   property is used to represent relationships or references between
   this MIME calendar component and another. The property value consists
   of the persistent, globally unique identifier of another MIME
   calendar component. This value would be represented in a MIME
   calendar component by the UID property.

   A linked relationship can be specified by a series of components that
   each, in turn, refer to their parent component. A group relationship
   can be specified by a number of components that all refer to one
   common parent component.

   Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property may
   impact the related calendar component. For example, if a group event
   changes its start or end date or time, then the related, dependent
   events will need to have their start and end dates changed in a
   corresponding way. This property is intended only to provide
   information on the relationship of calendar components. It is up to
   the target calendar system to maintain this relationship.

   The following is an example of this property:

3.1.6.27 Start Date/Time

   This property is identified by the property name DTSTART. This
   property defines the date and time that the calendar component will
   start. The date and time value is expressed in the complete
   representation, basic format as specified in ISO 8601. The time can
   either be in local or UTC based time. Alternatively, the value may be
   a duration of time, expressed in the ISO 8601 format as specified in
   section 3.1.3.8. In this case, the start is relative to another MIME
   calendar component specified by the RELATED-TO property. Events may
   have a start date/time but no end date/time. In that case, the event
   does not take up any time. The following is an example of this
   property:

3.1.6.30 Time Transparency

   This property is identified by the property name TRANSP. This
   property defines whether the event is transparent to free time
   searches. The value of this property is a number. A value of zero
   (ASCII decimal 48) guarantees that the entry will blocks time and
   will be factored into a free time search. A value of one (ASCII
   decimal 49) specifies that the entry will not block time and will not
   be factored into a free time search. Any values greater than _1_ will
   provide implementation specific transparency semantics. Some
   implementations may treat values greater than one as non-blocking or
   transparent events. Other implementations may use the numeric value
   to provide a layering of levels of transparency. The default value is
   zero (ASCII decimal 48), the event is not transparent and will block
   free time searches. The following is an example of this property:

     TRANSP:0

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is INTEGER.

3.1.6.31 Uniform Resource Locator

   This property is identified by the property name URL. This property

   not generate this property in MIME calendar components may be
   limiting their interoperability with other group scheduling
   applications.

   This property is optional for MIME entities conforming to this
   content type. The default data type for this property is STRING. The
   data type may alternatively be specified to be CID, MID, or URL.

3.1.6.33 Non-standard Properties

   The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type provides a _standard
   mechanism for doing non-standard things_. This extension support is
   provided for implementers to _push the envelope_ on the existing
   version of the specification. Extension properties are specified by
   property and/or property parameter names that have the initial sub-
   string of X- (the two character sequence: Capital X character
   followed by the Dash character). It is recommended that vendors
   concatenate onto this sentinel an added short sub-string to identify
   the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the extensions and
   minimize possible collision of names between different vendors. User
   agents that support this content type are expected to be able to
   parse the extension properties and property parameters but may ignore
   them. The following might be the ABC vendor's extension for an audio-
   clip form of subject property:

     X-ABC-MMSUBJ;TYPE=WAVE; VALUE=URL: http://load.noise.org/mysubj.wav

   At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension
   properties and property parameters. The default data type for this
   property is STRING.

3.2 Formal Definition

   The following modified Backus-Naur Notation (BNF) is provided to
   assist developers in building parsers for the properties of this MIME
   content type..

     This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC
     822,but it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:

     CR         = <ASCII CR, carriage return>  ; (     15,      13.)

3.3 Basic Recurrence Rule Grammar

   The specification of recurring events can be simplified by the use of
   a grammar or rule notation. This specification makes use of the Base
   Recurrence Rule Grammar from the [XAPIA].

   A recurrence rule is a string or clear-text encoding of a recurrence
   specification. A recurrence rule is composed of several components. A
   rule begins with a frequency which describes the type of repeating
   event (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.). This is followed by an interval
   which indicates how often the frequency repeats (i.e., daily, every
   third day, etc.). This can be followed by optional frequency modifier
   information and either an end date or a duration.

   Below is the form of a typical rule. This example causes events to be
   generated every other week on Tuesday and Thursday, for 8
   occurrences:

     W2 TU TH #4

   Where, W is the Frequency, 2 is the Interval, TU and TH are the
   optional Frequency Modifiers, and #4 is the Duration.

   The basic recurrence rule grammar supports six types of repetition.
   The six types follow the same form with only the frequency name and
   optional modifier information changing from one type of frequency to
   the next.

3.3.1 Daily Rule

   The daily rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an
   interval of a day or more. These can range from every day to every
   200th day and beyond. The daily rule begins with the letter D
   followed by an interval (representing days) and an optional duration
   or end date.

   Some examples follow:

     Daily for 10 occurrences:
        D1 #10

     Daily until 12/24/94:
        D1 19941224T000000Z

     Every other day - forever:
        D2 #0

     Every 10 days, 5 occurrences:
        D10 #5

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


3.3.2 Weekly Rule

   The weekly rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an
   interval of a week or more. The basic weekly rule has the same form
   as the daily rule except that the rule begins with a W and can
   contain an optional list of weekdays the events are generated on. For
   weekly rules, the interval represents weeks. Some examples follow:

     Weekly for 10 occurrences:
        W1 #10

     Weekly until 12/24/94:
        W1 19941224T000000Z

     Every other week - forever:
        W2 #0

     Weekly on Tuesday and
     Thursday for 5 weeks:
        W1 TU TH #5

     Every other week on Monday Wednesday and Friday until 12/24/94:
        W2 MO WE FR 19941224T000000Z

3.3.3 Monthly Rule

   The monthly rule is used for specifying repeating events base on an
   interval of a month or more. There are two types of monthly
   recurrence rules. One for by-position and one for by-day. The by-
   position rule allows weekdays in the month to be specified in
   relation to their occurrence in the month. An example would be to
   specify the third Sunday of the month or the last Friday of the
   month. An occurrence specifier may be used in monthly by-position
   rules. The occurrence specifiers control which occurrence of a
   weekday in a month an event occurs on:

     1+, 2+, ... 5+ for the first occurrence, second, ...fifth
     occurrence of the month.

     1-, 2-, ... 5- for the last occurrence, second to last occurrence,
     etc.

   A 2+ FR SA would indicate the second occurrence of Friday and
   Saturday in the month. A 1- MO would indicate the first occurrence of
   Monday working from the end of the month backwards (i.e., the last
   occurrence). A 2- MO would be the second to the last Monday of the
   month.

   A by-day rule allows actual day numbers to be specified such as the
   12th day or 29th day.

   The by-position rule begins with a MP and the by-day rule begins with
   a MD. The interval in monthly rules represents months. Some examples
   follow:

     Monthly on the 1st Friday for ten occurrences:
        MP1 1+ FR #10

     Monthly on the 1st Friday until 12/24/94:
        MP1 1+ FR 19941224T000000Z

     Every other month on the 1st and last
     Sunday of the month for 10 occurrences:
        MP2 1+ SU 1- SU #10

     Every six months on the 2nd Monday
     thru Friday for 10 occurrences:
        MP6 2+ MO TU WE TH FR #10

     Monthly on the second last Monday of the month for 6 months:

        MP1 2- MO #6

     Monthly on the third to the last day of the month, forever:

        MD1 3- #0

     Monthly on the 2nd and 15th of the month for 10 occurrences:
        MD1 2 15 #10

     In the next example LD refers to _LastDay_ in a monthly recurrence
     rule. Monthly on the 1st and last day of the month for 10
     occurrences:
        MD1 1 LD #10 or MD1 1 1- #10

     Every 18 months on the 10th thru 15th of the month for 10
     occurrences:
        MD18 10 11 12 13 14 15 #10

     Monthly on the second to the last day for 5 months. So, if the
     start date is August 1996, the event would repeat on 8/30/96,
     9/29/96, 10/30/96, 11/29/96, and 12/30/96:
        MD1 2- #5

3.3.4 Yearly Rule

   The yearly rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an
   interval of a year or more. There are two types of yearly recurrence
   rules. One for by-month and one for by-day. The by-month rule allows
   specific months out of the year to be specified. The by-day allows
   specific days to be specified. In the by-month rule, the day in the
   month the rule is to occur on is determined from the initial
   appointment.

   The by-month rule begins with a YM and the by-day rule begins with a
   YD. The interval in yearly rules represents years. Some examples
   follow:

3.3.6 Grammar Glossary

   enddate      Controls when a repeating event terminates. The enddate
                is the last time an event can occur.

   Interval     Defines the frequency in which a rule repeats.

   duration     Controls the number of events a rule generates.

   Lastday      Can be used as a replacement to daynumber to indicate
   the last day of the month.

   daynumber    A number representing a day of the month.

   month                A number representing a month of the year.

   day          A number representing a day of the year.

   occurrence   Controls which week of the month a particular weekday
   event occurs.

   weekday      A symbol representing a day of the week.

   daily                Defines a rule that repeats on a daily basis.

   weekly               Defines a rule that repeats on a weekly basis.

   monthlybypos Defines a rule that repeats on a monthly basis on a
   relative day and week.

   monthlybyday Defines a rule that repeats on a monthly basis on an
   absolute day.

   yearlybymonth        Defines a rule that repeats on specific months
   of the year.

   yearlybyday  Defines a rule that repeats on specific days of the
   year.

3.3.7 Policies

   1.      The duration portion of a rule defines the total number of events
     the rule generates, including the first event.

   2.      Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
     next event time and date is derived from the Start Time entry
     attribute.

   3.      If an end date and a duration is specified in the rule, the
     recurring event ceases when the end date is reached or the number
     of events indicated in the duration occur; whichever comes first.

   4.      If the duration or an end date is not established in the rule
     (e.g., D4) the event occurs twice. That is D4 is equivalent to D4
     #2.

   5.      A duration of #0 means repeat this event forever.

   6.      Using the occurrence specifier 5+ (e.g. 5th Friday) or 5- (e.g.
     5th from last Friday) in a month that does not contain 5 weeks
     does not generate an event and thus does not count against the
     duration. The same applies to providing a day of the month that
     does not occur in the month. For example the 30th or 31st .

   7.      The start time and date of an entry must be synchronized with one
     of the repeating events defined by its recurrence rule. The
     following is not allowed:

        Initial Appt Date:      7/1/94 (Friday)
        Recurrence Rule:                W1 MO TH #5

     The following is acceptable:

        Initial Appt Date:      7/1/94 (Friday)
        Recurrence Rule:                W1 MO FR #5 or W1 #5

   8.      If the optional <occurrencelist> and <weekdaylist> information is
     missing from a <monthlybypos> occurrence the information is
     derived from the entry attributes. The <occurrence> used in the
     recurring event is a count from the beginning of the month to the
     entry date and the <weekday> used is the day of the week the entry
     is scheduled to occur on.

   9.      If the <monthlybypos> occurrence or <monthlybyday> occurrence does
     not list a week day (e.g., SU or day 10) in the rule, the week day
     is established from the entry attribute information. As an example
     the rule MP1 #3 used in an entry with a start date of 7/20/94

     (which is the third Wednesday of the month) repeats on 8/17/94
     which is the third Wednesday of the month.

4. Registration of Content Type Profiles

   This section defines procedures by which usage profiles for the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type are registered with the IANA
   and made available to the Internet community. Note that non-IANA
   profiles may be used by bilateral agreement, provided the associated
   profile names follow the "X-" convention defined above in Section
   3.1.6.33.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new profiles, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new profiles.

   Registration of a new profile is accomplished by the following steps.

4.1 Define the profile

   A profile is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME profile XXX

     Profile name:

     Profile purpose:

     Profile type/subtype:

     Profile special notes (optional):

     Intended usage: (one of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)

   The explanation of what goes in each field in the template follows.

   Profile name: The name of the profile as it will be generally
   referred to in public. This name is required in the profile.

   Profile purpose: The purpose of the profile (e.g., to schedule
   document management updates, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description. This description is required in the profile.

   Profile type/subtype: The type/subtypes of the profile as they will
   appear in the text/calendar MIME Content-Type Profile parameter. This
   list of type/subtype values is required in the profile.

   Profile properties: The list of MIME Calendaring and Scheduling
   Content Type properties associated with the profile. This list of
   properties that are included in the profile. If a property is
   required by the profile, it should noted in this section. Other types
   not mentioned in the profile definition may also be present. Note

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   that any new properties referenced by the profile must be defined
   separately as described in Section 4.6.

   Profile special notes: Any special notes about the profile, how it is
   to be used, etc. This section is not required in the profile.

4.2 Post the profile definition

   The profile description must be posted to the IETF Calendaring and
   Scheduling Working Group discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

4.3 Allow a comment period

   Discussion on the new profile must be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus must be reached on the
   profile before submitting the profile for approval.

4.4 Submit the profile for approval

   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the profile, the registration
   application should be submitted to the Profile Reviewer for approval.

   The Profile Reviewer is appointed to the Application Area Directors
   and may either accept or reject the profile registration. An accepted
   registration should be passed on by the Profile Reviewer to the IANA
   for inclusion in the official IANA profile registry. The registration
   may be rejected for any of the following reasons. 1) Insufficient
   comment period; 2) Consensus not reached; 3) Technical deficiencies
   raised on the list or elsewhere have not been addressed. The Profile
   Reviewer's decision to reject a profile may be appealed by the
   proposer to the IESG, or the objections raised can be addressed by
   the proposer and the profile resubmitted.

4.5 Profile Change Control

   Existing profiles may be changed using the same process by which they
   were registered.

   1.      Define the change

   2.      Post the change

   3.      Allow a comment period

   4.      Submit the profile for approval

   Note that the original author or any other interested party may
   propose a change to an existing profile, but that such changes should
   only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in the
   published specification. The Profile Reviewer may object to a change
   if it is not backwards compatible, but is not required to do so.

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


   Profile definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   profiles which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.

4.6 Registration of New Content Type Properties

   This section defines procedures by which new properties for the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type are registered with the IANA.
   Note that non-IANA properties may be used by bilateral agreement,
   provided the associated properties names follow the "X-" convention
   defined above in Section 3.1.6.33.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

4.6.1 Define the property

   A property is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX

     Property name:

     Property purpose:

     Property data type(s):

     Property encoding:

     Property special notes (optional):

     Intended usage: (one of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)

   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

   Property name: The name of the property, as it will appear in the
   body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line to
   the left of the colon ":".

   Property purpose: The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
   delegate for the event or todo, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description.

   Property data type(s): Any of the valid data types for the property
   value needs to be specified. The default data type also needs to be
   specified. If a new data type is specified, it needs to be declared
   in this section.

   Property encoding: The encodings permitted for the property value.
   This description must be precise and must not violate the general
   encoding rules defined in section 3.1.3.3of this document.

   Property special notes: Any special notes about the property, how it
   is to be used, etc.

4.6.2 Post the Property definition

   The property description must be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

4.6.3 Allow a comment period

   Discussion on the new property must be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus must be reached on the
   property before proceeding to step 4.

4.6.4 Submit the property for approval

   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Profile Reviewer
   for approval. The Profile Reviewer is appointed to the Application
   Area Directors and may either accept or reject the property
   registration. An accepted registration should be passed on by the
   Profile Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA
   profile registry. The registration may be rejected for any of the
   following reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not
   reached; 3) Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere
   have not been addressed. The Profile Reviewer's decision to

   reject a property may be appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the
   objections raised can be addressed by the proposer and the property
   resubmitted.

4.7 Content Type Property Change Control

   Existing properties may be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.

        1.           Define the change

        2.           Post the change

        3.           Allow a comment period

        4.           Submit the property for approval

11. Extended Recurrence Grammar

   The material in this section is provided as an informational
   reference. It is copied, with permission of the XAPIA, from the
   [XAPIA]. This section defines an extended recurrence rule grammar
   that may be useful to implementations wishing to extend the
   capability of the basic recurrence rule grammar defined by this
   specification. The material is equally applicable to extended support
   of the exception rules for repeating events.

11.1 Rule Introduction

   A recurrence rule is made up of one or more recurrence frequencies.
   The frequencies express the granularity of the repeating event. The
   smallest granularity is based on minutes, the largest is based on
   years. Each frequency is immediately followed by an interval. The
   interval helps to define how often the frequency repeats (daily,
   every third day, etc.):

     D2

   Where, where D is the Frequency and 2 is the Interval.

     M5 Repeat every five minutes

     D1 Repeat daily

     D2 Repeat every other day

     D3 Repeat every third day

     W1 Repeat weekly

     W2 Repeat every other week

     W3 Repeat every third week

   The meaning of the interval depends on the frequency. As an example,
   the 5 in M5 is in minutes while the 3 in D3 is in days.

   A rule can end with the duration symbol, #, followed by a number.
   This defines the number of times the repetition occurs (including the
   first time).

Internet Draft           MIME C&S Content Type        November 26, 1996


     D2 #5

   Where, #5 is the Duration. In this example, the event occurs every
   other day and the duration indicates it occur 5 times.

   There may be other information between the frequency and the duration
   that supplements the meaning of the rule:

     D2 1200 1600 #5

   In this example, the event occurs every other day at 1200 and 1600
   for a total of 10 occurrences. The duration controls the number of
   times the rule occurs. In this case the rule defines two occurrences
   (1200 and 1600) so a total of 10 (2 x 5) occurrences are generated.

   A rule can be made up of several recurrence rules:

     MP6 1+ MO #5 D2 1200 1600 #5 M5 #3

   This recurrence rule is made up of three recurrence rules. Every time
   the first rule executes (every 6 months) it executes the next rule to
   the right. If there is not a rule to the right an event is generated.
   In this case there is a daily frequency rule to the right of the
   monthly frequency rule. It executes twice a day; starting on the
   first Monday of the month. The daily frequency rule executes a total
   of ten times. Since there is a rule following the daily rule it
   executes it each time the daily frequency rule executes. The minute
   frequency rule is executed three times, every time the daily
   frequency rule executes, for a total of six times a day. The above
   rules generate a total of 150 (5 * (2 * 5) * 3) occurrences. An
   occurrence specifier may be used in some rules. The occurrence
   specifier controls which occurrence of a weekday in a month an event
   occurs on:

     1+, 2+, ... 5+ for the first occurrence, second, ...fifth
     occurrence of the month.

   1-, 2-...5- for the last occurrence, second to last occurrence, etc.

     MP2 1+ 2- FR #3

   Where, 1+ and 2- are Occurrence Specifiers.

   This rule defines an event which happens every other month on the
   first Friday and second to the last Friday of the month. It generates
   a total of six occurrences. The end marker symbol $ can be used to
   terminate a rule early:

     W1 0100$ 0200 0300 #4

   The above rule generates occurrences weekly for 4 weeks at 0100, 0200
   and 0300. On the last (fourth week) an event is generated at 0100
   only.

11.4 Policies

   1.      The duration portion of a rule defines the total number of
     occurrences the rule generates, including the first event. As an
     example, the rule MP1 #3 W1 #3 starting on 1/1/94 would generate
     occurrences on 1/1/94, 1/8, 1/15, 2/5/94, 2/12, 2/19, 3/5/94,
     3/12, 3/19.

   2.      The duration granularity is defined by the recurrence frequency
     immediately preceding the duration portion of the rule. For
     example, D1 #5 M15 #4 establishes a repeating event which happens
     for five days, four times per day.

   3.      Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
     next event time and date is derived from the event start time.

   4.      If no specific time is indicated in the recurrence rule it is
     taken from the event.

   5.      If an end date and a duration for the first rule in a nested rule
     are specified in the rule, then the recurring event ceases when
     the end date is reached or the number of occurrences indicated in
     the duration occur; whichever comes first.

   6.      If the duration or and end date is not established in the rule
     (e.g. ``D2'') the event occurs twice. That is D2 is equivalent to
     D2 #2.

   7.      If an end-mark is used in a second or later rule of a nested rule,
     then the end-mark is applied each time that rule is executed by
     the previous rule. YM1 1 6 #1 MD1 7$ 14 generates occurrences on
     1/7 1/14 2/7 6/7 6/14 7/7.

   8.      If an end-mark is used on a day of the week which is followed by
     several times (TU$ 1200 1300) or an end-mark is used on a week
     occurrence that is followed by several weekdays (1+$ TU WE) the
     repeating event stops after the last time or week day in the list
     is executed.

   9.      If a rule has an ambiguity with respect to whether it will repeat
     on a specific day (12th of the month) versus on a relative day
     (2nd Friday of the month), the specific day takes precedence. The
     only exception to this policy is policy 14.

   10.       A duration of #0 means repeat this event forever.

   11.       Nested rules can not have a duration of 0. These are not allowed:

        YM1 6 #10 MP1 1+ SA #0
        D5 0600 0800 #5 M5 #0

   12.       Using the occurrence specifier 5+ (e.g. 5th Friday) or 5- (e.g.
     5th from last Friday) in a month that does not contain 5 weeks
     does not generate an event and thus does not count against the
     duration. The same applies to providing a day of the month that
     does not occur in the month: 31st.

   13.       The start time and date of an event must be in-sync with one of
     the event slots defined by its occurrence rule. The following are
     not allowed:

        Initial Appt Time:      1300
        Recurrence Rule:        D1 1400 #5
        Initial Appt Date:      7/1/94 (Friday)
        Recurrence Rule:        W1 MO TH #5

     The following are acceptable:

        Initial Appt Time:      1300
        Recurrence Rule:        D1 #5 or D1 1300 #5
        Initial Appt Date:      7/1/94 (Friday)
        Recurrence Rule:        W1 MO FR #5 or W1 #5

   14.       If the optional <weekdaytime> information is missing from a
     <monthlybypos> frequency, the information is derived from the
     initial event. The <occurrence> used in the recurring event is a
     count from the beginning of the month to the event date and the
     <weekday> used is the day of the week the initial event is
     scheduled to occur on. If the <monthlybypos> frequency does not
     list a week day (e.g. SU) in the rule, then the week day is
     established from the initial event information. As an example, the
     rule MP1 #3 used in an event with a start date of 7/20/94 (which
     is the third Wed of the month) will repeat on 8/17/94 which is the
     third Wed of the month.

   15.       The next event of a higher order rule does not execute until all
     the occurrences of a sub-rule are generated. If the next event of
     a higher order rule comes earlier in time than the last event of a
     sub-rule then the missed occurrences are not generated. In other
     words, sub-rules can not interleave occurrences with other sub-
     rules. The following results in indeterminate results because the
     minute sub-rule which begins to execute at 0630 generates
     occurrences beyond 0700 which is when the daily sub-rule begins
     executing again:

        D1 0630 0700 #4 M45 #5

     Another incorrect rule:

        MP1 1+ 1- #3 W2 TU TH #5
