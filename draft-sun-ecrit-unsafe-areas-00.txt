Internet-Draft              LoST Unsafe Areas                  July 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes a
   protocol for mapping service identifiers and location information to
   URLs of the service instance.  The region of a service instance can
   also be provided in one or more serviceBoundary elements.

   According to the research of patterns of crime, the spatial
   differentiation of crimes occurred in the city is obvious.  There are
   a few pretty dangerous areas with high crime rate in many big cities,
   which may be identified and published by police departments.  For
   example monthly crime hot spots identified by phoenix police
   department [Monthly_Violent].

   This document helps to find out unsafe areas in the service region.
   These unsafe areas are the one where frequent crime (e.g. theft,
   robbery, pickpockets), accidents or some other incidents are
   happening.  There may be more than one unsafe area in a service
   region, and of course, may be zero.

   When the user enters in to an unsafe area where frequent pickpockets
   are happening, the user's device will prompt him the warning "many
   pick-pockets are in this area, especially at bus stops" and the
   seriousness of the problem.  So that he can take necessary
   precautions to handle the given situation after entering in this
   area.  To achieve this task, we add new elements named unsafeArea,
   note, and rank in the <findServiceResponse>. the unsafe area is
   requested by the client, using the 'unsafeArea' attribute in the
   <findService> request with the value set to "value" or "reference".

   The LoST client's device can prompt a user when he enters in to an
   area which has or might have a natural disaster threats like flood,
   snowslide, landslip, wild fire etc, or when he drives in to an
   accident prone area.  Sailing or swimming people can also find out
   the dangerous areas with submerged rocks or sharks.


2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  LoST extensions

   The LoST client can ask the server to return unsafe areas.  And we
   introduce a new attribute in LoST request <findService> named

Internet-Draft              LoST Unsafe Areas                  July 2008


   'unsafeArea' for this purpose.

   We introduce new elements in LoST response <findServiceResponse>
   named, <unsafeArea>, <note> and <rank> to describe the unsafe areas
   and its information.

3.1.  Request unsafe areas

   The new attribute 'unsafeArea' in LoST request <findService>
   indicates the LoST client wants to get the unsafe areas information
   of the determined service instance.



      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <findService
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
        xmlns:p2="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        serviceBoundary="value"
        recursive="true"
        unsafeArea="value">

        <location id="6020688f1ce1896d" profile="geodetic-2d">
          <p2:Point id="point1" srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
             <p2:pos>37.775 -122.422</p2:pos>
          </p2:Point>
        </location>
        <service>urn:service:sos.police</service>

      </findService>

              Figure 1: A <findService> query


3.2.  Specifying unsafe areas in the response

   The new element <unsafeArea> is used to specify the dangerous areas
   in the service region.  A <unsafeArea> element contains at least one
   <areaBoundary> element.  An area boundary circumscribes the unsafe
   region.  It has the similar semantics with serviceBoundary element.



   And he gets the response with the <unsafeArea> details:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <findServiceResponse xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
        xmlns:p2="http://www.opengis.net/gml">

3.3.  Additional information about the <unsafeArea>

   The new element <note> can be used to specify the additional
   information about the unsafe area.  It could be some suggestion or
   warning text about this area.  This <note> message in the response
   may be prompted when the LoST client enters in to the given unsafe
   area, together with the seriousness, i.e. the <rank> element.  The
   value of the <rank> element is a number from 1 to 5, 5 means the most
   serious situation.
