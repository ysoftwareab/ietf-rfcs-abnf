Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of
   managed objects for SNMP-based management of DOCSIS compliant Cable
   Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.  This memo specifies a
   MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2[5][6][7].
   The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing
   SNMP standards.  This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group

   1. The SNMP Management Framework
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
        An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

      o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
        1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version, called
        SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

      o Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The
        third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

      o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
        set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
        in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and associated
        PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

      o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   2. Glossary
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over
   Cable Service Interface Specification process.
   2.1  CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.

   2.2  CM

   Cable Modem.  A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant
   cable data system.

   2.3  CMTS

   Cable Modem Termination System.  A generic term covering a cable
   bridge or cable router in a head-end.  A CMTS acts as the master
   station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.  It is the only
   station that transmits downstream, and it controls the scheduling of
   upstream transmissions by its associated CMs.

   2.4  DOCSIS

   Data Over Cable System Interface Specifications

   2.5 Downstream

   From the head-end towards the subscriber.

   2.6 Head-end

   The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video
   signals. Generally also the location of the CMTS equipment.

   2.7  RF

   Radio Frequency.

   2.8  Upstream

   From the subscriber towards the headend via PSTN.

   3.  Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem Termination
   Systems (CMTS).  The specification is derived from the DOCSIS Radio
   Frequency Interface specification [16].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [19]

   3.1  Discussion

   The data-over-cable-system telephony return interface specification
   is documented in [20]. The management requirements of this interface
   are detailed in that specification. Specific inferences to other
   controls are itemized in the following list:  The Telephony Return CM
   and telephony Return CMTS MUST support the objects in the DOCSIS
   Cable Device MIB [21] and DOCSIS RFI MIB [22] that are applicable to
   downstream only. In a Telephony Return CM, the management of the
   telephony modem MAY use the Modem Management Information Base (MIB)
   using SMIv2 [23]. These objects generally require proprietary
   handling to address the telephony modems serial AT command interface.
   It is not reasonable to require MIB support for all third party dial
   modems. However, if a dial modem is integrated within a cable modem
   product, using a subset of the RFC1696 Modem MIB objects to control
   the dial modem is practical and reasonable.  Guidelines for dial
   modem physical capabilities are provided in [20]. Guidelines for
   specific applicability of [21], [22], and [23] for telephony return
   systems are provided in [24].

   3.2.1 Handling Of Service Provider Descriptor (SPD) Updates

   The Cable Modem service provider option process is documented in [5].
   An operator creates service provider descriptors (SPDs) that the CMTS
   will send to all CMs in its domain. The operator must signify one
   entry as factory default for initial dial-in service for a
   subscriber. An external telco-return modem may have objects within
   the selected SPD modified by changing corresponding scalar objects on
   a CM using the network management station.
   One reason for the SNMP-initiated SPD update is to allow loading of
   permanent Telephone Numbers, Login Usernames and Login Passwords
   without requiring individualized configuration files on a per CM
   basis.

   For example the operator MAY:

      o set docsTrTsSPDphoneNum1 to dial a temporary access Telephone
        Number. A factory default CM user may then be given some limited
        access by using default values for all other SPD objects.

      o Temporary system access may be upgraded after an undefined operator
        specified authentication. The operator may then set
        docsTrTsSPDphoneNum1, docsTrTsSPDuserName, docsTrTsSPDuserPassword
        (phone/login/password) or any other CM SPD objects to
        individualized settings.

      o These settings remain in effect unless changed by Telephone
        Settings Options in the CMs TFTP configuration file.

      o The operator may want to change individual Telephone Settings
        Options for CMs sharing a global TFTP configuration file.  For
        example, the DHCP Server (ip address) can be changed for all CMs
        sharing a configuration file without affecting any other active SPD
        settings by having just DHCP server parameter set in the file. All
        other MIB modified SPD parameters would remain active (excepting
        docsTrTsSPDdhcpAddress MIB object) if docsTrCmSPDpersistEnable is
        TRUE.
