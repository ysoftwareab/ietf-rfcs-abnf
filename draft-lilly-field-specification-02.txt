Abstract

   Implementation of generators and parsers of header fields requires
   certain information about those fields.  Interoperability is most
   likely when all such information is explicitly provided by the
   technical specification of the fields.  Lacking such explicit
   information, implementers may guess, and interoperability may suffer.
   This memo identifies information useful to implementers of header
   field generators and parsers.

Internet-Draft       Specification of Header Fields           March 2005

1. Introduction

   Internet messages consist of a message header and a body [N1.STD11],
   [N2.RFC2822].  MIME content begins with a MIME-part header
   [N3.RFC2045], [N4.RFC2046].  Message headers and MIME-part headers
   consist of fields.  While the Message Format and MIME specifications
   define their respective overall formats and some specific fields,
   they also have provision for extension fields.  A number of extension
   fields have been specified, some more or less completely than others.
   Incomplete or imprecise specification has led to interoperability
   problems as implementers make assumptions in the absence of
   specifications.  This memo identifies items of potential interest to
   implementers and section 4 of this memo may serve as a checklist for
   specifications of extension fields and field components.

2. Requirement Levels

   The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [N5.BCP14].

3. Scope

   This memo is intended to supplement various specifications,
   guidelines, and procedures for specification of header fields
   [N1.STD11], [N2.RFC2822], [N3.RFC2045], [N4.RFC2046], [N6.BCP9],
   [N7.BCP90].  It does not absolve authors of header field
   specifications from compliance with any provisions of those or other
   specifications, guidelines, and procedures.  It offers clarification
   and supplementary suggestions that will promote interoperability and
   may spare specification authors many questions regarding incomplete
   header field specifications.

4. Specification Items

4.1. Established Conventions

   A number of conventions exist for naming and specifying header
   fields.  It would be unwise and confusing to specify a field which
   conflicts with those conventions.

4.1.1. Standard Terminology

   Terms related to the Internet Message Format are defined in
   [N2.RFC2822].  Authors specifying extension header fields should use
   the same terms in the same manner in order to provide clarity and
   avoid confusion.  For example, a "header" is comprised of "header
   fields", each of which has a "field name" and usually has a "field
   body".  Each message may have multiple "headers", viz. a message
   header and MIME-part [N4.RFC2046] headers.  A message header has a
   Date header field (i.e. a field with field name "Date").  However,
   there is no "Date header"; use of such non-standard terms is likely
   to lead to confusion, possibly resulting in interoperability failures
   of implementations.

Internet-Draft       Specification of Header Fields           March 2005

4.1.2. Naming Conventions

   Several conventions have been established for naming of header
   fields.

4.1.2.1. Resent- prefix

   Specified for certain standard fields as given in [N1.STD11] and
   [N2.RFC2822].  If a Resent- version of a field is applicable, an
   author SHOULD say so explicitly, and SHOULD provide a comprehensive
   specification of any differences between the plain field and the
   Resent- version.

4.1.2.2. Content- prefix

   This prefix SHOULD be used for all MIME extension fields and SHOULD
   NOT be used for fields which are not MIME extension fields.

4.1.2.3. Accept- prefix

   This prefix SHOULD be used for all extension fields intended for use
   in content negotiation [I1.RFC2295] and SHOULD NOT be used for fields
   which are not intended for such use.

4.2. Common Specification Items

   Several items are specified for standard header fields; these items
   SHOULD also be specified for extension fields.

4.2.1. ABNF

   [N1.STD11] is vague about where whitespace is permitted or required
   in header field syntax.  [N2.RFC2822] addresses that issue by
   defining grammar productions such as FWS and CFWS.  Extension field
   ABNF SHOULD clearly specify where comments, line folding, and
   whitespace are prohibited and permitted, and SHOULD use the RFC 2822
   grammar productions in ABNF for that purpose.

   All ABNF MUST be carefully checked for ambiguities and to ensure that
   all productions resolve to some combination of terminal productions
   provided by a normative reference [N8.CKLIST].  [N9.RFC2234] provides
   several productions that may be useful.  While use of suitable
   productions defined and in use is encouraged, specification authors
   are cautioned that some such productions have been amended by
   subsequently issued RFCs and/or by formal errata [I2.Errata].

   Authors and designers should be careful not to mix syntax with
   disparate semantics within a single field.  Examples of disparate
   semantics are [N2.RFC2822] comments (which use parentheses as
   delimiters), [I3.RFC2533] feature sets (which also use parentheses as
   delimiters, but not for comments), and [I4.RFC3986] URIs (which
   permit parentheses in URI text).

Internet-Draft       Specification of Header Fields           March 2005

   It is sometimes necessary or desirable to define keywords as protocol
   elements in structured fields.  Protocol elements SHOULD be
   case-insensitive per the Internet Architecture [I5.RFC1958].
   Keywords are typically registered by IANA; a specification using
   registered keywords MUST include an IANA considerations section
   [N10.BCP26], and SHOULD indicate to readers of the specification
   precisely where IANA has set up the registry (authors will need to
   coordinate this with IANA prior to publication as an RFC).  In many
   cases, it will be desirable to make provision for extending the set
   of keywords; that may be done by specifying that the set may be
   extended by publication of an RFC, or a formal review and
   registration procedure may be specified (typically as a BCP RFC).

   If keywords are defined, and if there is any chance that the set of
   keywords might be expanded, a registry should be established via
   IANA.  If a registry is not established initially, there is a good
   chance that initially-defined keywords will not be registered, or
   will subsequently be registered with different semantics (this has
   happened!).

   Provision may be made for experimental or private-use keywords.
   These typically begin with a case-insensitive "x-" prefix.  Note that
   [N11.BCP82] has specific considerations for use of experimental
   keywords.

   If some field content is to be considered human-readable text, there
   MUST be provision for specifying language in accordance with
   [N12.BCP18].  Header fields typically use the mechanism specified in
   [I6.RFC2047] as amended by [I7.RFC2231] and [I2.Errata] for that
   purpose.  Note, however, that that mechanism applies only to three
   specific cases; unstructured fields, an RFC 822 "word" in an RFC 822
   "phrase", and comments in structured fields.  Any
   internationalization considerations SHOULD be detailed in an
   Internationalization Considerations section of the specification as
   specified in [N12.BCP18].

   Some field bodies may include ABNF representing numerical values.
   Such ABNF, its comments, and supporting normative text SHOULD clearly
   indicate whether such a numerical value is decimal, octal,
   hexadecimal, etc., whether or not leading and/or trailing zeroes are
   significant and/or permitted, and how any combinations of numeric
   fields are intended to be interpreted.  For example, two numeric
   fields separated by a dot, exemplified by "001.100", "1.1", "1.075",
   and "1.75" might be interpreted in several ways, depending on factors
   such as those enumerated above.

4.2.2. Minimum and Maximum Instances of Fields per Header

   Some fields are mandatory, others are optional.  It may make sense to
   permit multiple instances of a field in a given header; in other
   cases at most a single instance is sensible.  RFC 2822 specifies a
   minimum and maximum count per header for each standard field in a
   message; specification authors SHOULD likewise specify minimum and
   maximum counts for extension fields.

Internet-Draft       Specification of Header Fields           March 2005

4.2.3. Categorization

   RFC 2822 defines categories of header fields (e.g. trace fields,
   address fields).  Such categories have implications for processing
   and handling of fields.  A specification author SHOULD indicate any
   applicable categories.

4.3. Semantics

   In addition to specifying syntax of a field, a specification document
   should indicate the semantics of each field.  Such semantics are
   comprised of several aspects:

4.3.1. Producers, Modifiers, and Consumers

   Some fields are intended for end-to-end communication between author
   or sender and recipient; such fields should not be generated or
   altered by intermediaries in the transmission chain [I8.Crocker05].
   Other fields comprise trace information which is added during
   transport.  Authors SHOULD clearly specify who may generate a field,
   who may modify it in transit, who should interpret such a field, and
   who is prohibited from interpreting or modifying the field.

4.3.2. What's it All About?

   When introducing a new field or modifying an existing field, an
   author should present a clear description of what problem or
   situation is being addressed by the extension or change.

4.3.3. Context

   The permitted types of headers in which the field may appear should
   be specified.  Some fields might only be appropriate in a message
   header, some might appear in MIME-part headers as well as message
   headers, still others might appear in specialized MIME media types.

4.4. Overall Considerations

   Several factors should be considered regarding how a field interacts
   with the Internet at large, with the applications for which it is
   intended, and in interacting with other applications.

4.4.1. Security

   Every specification is supposed to include a carefully-considered
   Security Considerations section [N13.RFC2223], [I9.BCP72].

4.4.2. Backwards Compatibility

   There is a large deployed base of applications which use header
   fields.  Implementations that comprise that deployed base may change
   very slowly.  It is therefore critically important to consider the
   impact of a new or revised field or field component on that deployed
   base.  A new field, or extensions to the syntax of an existing field

Lilly                  Expires September 15, 2005               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Specification of Header Fields           March 2005

   or field component, might not be recognizable to deployed
   implementations.  Depending on the care with which the authors of an
   extension have considered such backwards compatibility, such an
   extension might, for example:

   a. Cause a deployed implementation to simply ignore the field in its
      entirety.  That is not a problem provided that it is a new field
      and that there is no assumption that such deployed implementations
      will do otherwise.

   b. Cause a deployed implementation to behave differently from how it
      would behave in the absence of the proposed change, in ways that
      are not intended by the proposal.  That is a failure of the
      proposal to remain backwards compatible with the deployed base of
      implementations.

   There are many subtleties and variations that may come into play.
   Authors SHOULD very carefully consider backwards compatibility when
   devising extensions, and SHOULD clearly describe all known
   compatibility issues.

4.4.3. Compatibility With Legacy Content

   Content is sometimes archived for various reasons.  It is sometimes
   necessary or desirable to access archived content, with the semantics
   of that archived content unchanged.  It is therefore important that
   lack of presence of an extension field or field component should not
   be construed (by an extension specification) as conferring new
   semantics on a message or piece of MIME content which lacks that
   field or field component.

4.4.4. Interaction With Established Mechanisms

   Header fields are handled specially by gateways under various
   circumstances.  Message fragmentation and reassembly [N4.RFC2046] is
   one example.  If special treatment is required for a header field
   under such circumstances, it SHOULD be clearly specified by the
   author of the specification.  [I10.RFC3798] is an example of how this
   might be handled (however, because that specification requires
   deployed RFC 2046-conforming implementations to be modified, it is
   not strictly backwards compatible).

4.4.5. Architectural Considerations

   Messages are long-lived; many are archived for decades, and may be
   read at any time.  Messages may be read in an off-line environment.
   Header field content other than address fields SHOULD NOT rely on
   availability of DNS [I11.RFC1034], [I12.RFC1035] or similar
   distributed databases for interpretation of field body content.  DNS
   records are ephemeral; domains come and go frequently, and DNS
   records are subject to change at any time.  DNS is only available to
   applications when online; consequently it is unavailable when
   messages are being read offline.

5. Acknowledgments

   The author would like to acknowledge the helpful comments provided by
   members of the ietf-822 mailing list.  In particular, Peter Koch and
   Keith Moore have made useful comments.

6. Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are addressed by this memo.  The memo
   reinforces the need for careful consideration of security issues.

7. Internationalization Considerations

   This memo does not directly have internationalization considerations,
   however it reminds specification authors of the need to consider
   internationalization of textual field components.

8. IANA Considerations

   While no specific action is required of IANA in regard to this memo,
   it does note that some coordination between IANA and specification
   authors who do require IANA to set up registries is at least
   desirable, if not a necessity.  IANA should also closely coordinate
   with the RFC Editor so that registries are set up and properly
   referenced at the time of publication of an RFC which refers to such
   a registry.  IANA is also encouraged to work closely with authors and
   the RFC Editor to ensure that descriptions of registries maintained
   by IANA are accurate and meaningful.
