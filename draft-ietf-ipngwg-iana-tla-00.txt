1.0 Introduction

   This document proposes initial assignments of IPv6 Sub-TLA
   Aggregation Identifiers (Sub-TLA ID) to the Address Registries and
   continued management of the IP6.INT domain.  It is intended as input
   to the IANA from the IETF IP Next Generation (IPNG) and Next
   Generation Transition (NGTRANS) working groups as an aid in starting
   the process of allocating IPv6 addresses.  It is not intended for any
   official IETF status.

INTERNET-DRAFT     Initial IPv6 Sub-TLA ID Assignments         16-Nov-98


   The IAB and IESG have authorized the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) as the appropriate entity to have the responsibility
   for the management of the IPv6 address space as defined in [ALLOC].

   The proposed initial assignment described in the document is
   consistent with:

      - RFC 2373,"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" [ARCH]
      - RFC 2374 "An Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format" [AGGR]
      - "Proposed TLA and NLA Assignment Rules" [TLA-RULES]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.0 Background

   [TLA-RULES] specifies that TLA assignments will be done in two
   stages.  The first stage is to allocate a Sub-TLA ID.  This document
   specifies the initial assignments of Sub-TLA ID's to the Registries.

   As defined in [TLA-RULES] Section 5.1:

     "Sub-TLA ID's are assigned out of TLA ID 0x0001 as follows.  Note
      that use of the Reserved field to create the Sub-TLA field is
      specific to TLA ID 0x0001.  It does not affect any other TLA.

         | 3  |    13    |    13   |       19      |
         +----+----------+---------+---------------+
         | FP |   TLA    | Sub-TLA |       NLA     |
         |    |   ID     |         |       ID      |
         +----+----------+---------+---------------+

      where:

       FP = 001 = Format Prefix

          This is the Format Prefix used to identify aggregatable global
          unicast addresses.

       TLA ID = 0x0001 = Top-Level Aggregation Identifier

          This is the TLA ID assigned by the IANA for Sub-TLA
          allocation.

       Sub-TLA ID = Sub-TLA Aggregation Identifier

INTERNET-DRAFT     Initial IPv6 Sub-TLA ID Assignments         16-Nov-98


          The Sub-TLA ID field is used by the registries for initial
          allocations to organizations meeting the requirements in
          Section 5.2 of this document.  The IANA will assign small
          blocks (e.g., few hundred) of Sub-TLA ID's to registries.  The
          registries will assign the Sub-TLA ID's to organizations
          meeting the requirements specified in Section 5.2.  When the
          registries have assigned all of their Sub-TLA ID's they can
          request that the IANA give them another block.  The blocks do
          not have to be contiguous.  The IANA may also assign Sub-TLA
          ID's to organizations directly.  This includes the temporary
          TLA assignment for testing and experimental usage for
          activities such as the 6bone or new approaches like exchanges.

       NLA ID = Next-Level Aggregation Identifier

          Next-Level Aggregation ID's are used by organizations assigned
          a TLA ID to create an addressing hierarchy and to identify
          sites.  The organization can assign the top part of the NLA ID
          in a manner to create an addressing hierarchy appropriate to
          its network."

3.0 Initial Assignments

   As specified in [TLA-RULES] assignments of Sub-TLA ID's will be done
   in blocks.  The initial assignment of Sub-TLA ID's to registries will
   be in blocks of 64 Sub-TLA ID's.  These assignments are as follows:

      Binary            Range (Hex)       Assignment
      ----------------  ---------------   -------------------
      0 0000 00XX XXXX  0x0000 - 0x003F   IANA
      0 0000 01XX XXXX  0x0040 - 0x007F   APNIC
      0 0000 10XX XXXX  0x0080 - 0x00BF   ARIN
      0 0000 11XX XXXX  0x00C0 - 0x00FF   RIPE
      0 0001 00XX XXXX  0x0100 - 0x013F   (future assignment)
      0 0001 01XX XXXX  0x0140 - 0x017F   (future assignment)
      0 0001 10XX XXXX  0x0180 - 0x01BF   (future assignment)
      0 0001 11XX XXXX  0x01C0 - 0x01FF   (future assignment)
      0 0010 00XX XXXX  0x0200 - 0x023F   (future assignment)
          .   .    .
          .   .    .
          .   .    .
      1 1111 11XX XXXX  0x1FC0 - 0x1FFF   (future assignment)

      Where "X" indicates "0" or "1".

   When a registry has assigned all of the Sub-TLA ID's in their block
   they can request that the IANA provide another block.  The blocks
   assigned to a registry do not have to be contiguous.

INTERNET-DRAFT     Initial IPv6 Sub-TLA ID Assignments         16-Nov-98


   The block of Sub-TLA ID's assigned to the IANA (i.e., 0x0000 -
   0x003F) is for assignment for testing and experimental usage to
   support activities such as the 6bone, and for new approaches like
   exchanges.


4.0 IP6.INT DOMAIN Management

   In RFC-1886, "DNS Extensions to support IP version 6", a special
   domain is defined to look up a record given an address. The intent of
   this domain is to provide a way of mapping an IPv6 address to a host
   name, although it may be used for other purposes as well. The domain
   is rooted at IP6.INT.

   The IP6.INT domain has been in use for the IPv6 "6bone" testbed
   network to provide mapping from IPv6 Test addresses to domain names
   under the special IPv6 Testing Address Allocation [TST-ALLOC] and has
   been managed by direction of the IANA at ISI.

   The management of the IP6.INT domain will continue to be done in the
   same manner for the Sub-TLA ID's as they are assigned based on the
   assignment defined in this document.


5.0 Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to express their thanks to Joyce Reynolds and
   Thomas Narten for their help with this document.


6.0 Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.  Authentication of IPv6 packets is defined
   in [AUTH].  Authentication of the ownership of prefixes to avoid
   "prefix stealing" is a related security issue but is beyond the scope
   of this document.
