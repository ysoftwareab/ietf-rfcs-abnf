Internet-Draft             APP Outline Format               October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Many applications require an outline of resources.  XML [W3C.REC-xml-
   20040204] documents are organized hierarchically, but XML does not
   differentiate between elements serving as structural divisions and
   elements serving as structural properties.  This specification
   defines two elements which serve as structural divisions, provides an
   associated XML document structure, and defines minimal user agent
   conformance rules.

   Example APP Outline Document:

   <app>
     <outline text="A Server" href="http://example.com">
       <outline text="xyzzy" href="http://example.org"/>
       <outline text="thud" href="http://example.net"/>
     </outline>
     <outline class="special details" text="Some details...">
       <outline text="xyzzy" href="http://example.org/details"/>
       <outline text="thud" href="http://example.net/details"/>
     </outline>
   </app>

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This specification includes a normative RELAX NG Compact schema
   [RELAX-NG].

   The terms 'URI' and 'IRI' are shorthand for the identifiers specified
   in [RFC3986] and [RFC3987].

3.  APP Outline Documents

   APP Outline Documents MUST be well-formed XML [W3C.REC-xml-20040204].

   The root element of an APP Outline Document is "<app>".  This
   specification does not define any attributes of the <app> element,
   but the element MAY have any number of attributes.

   Zero or more <outline> elements MAY appear as child elements of
   <app>.  Also, <outline> elements MAY contain zero or more <outline>
   elements.  This specification defines three attributes of the
   <outline> element. <outline> elements MUST contain at least one of

Internet-Draft             APP Outline Format               October 2005


   those attributes.  Outline properties that are too large to
   efficiently include in attribute values MAY appear as child elements
   of the outline element.

3.1  The 'text' Attribute

   The 'text' attribute contains a short string describing the outline
   element.  Entities such as "&amp;" and "&lt;" represent their
   corresponding characters ("&" and "<" respectively), not markup.

3.2  The 'href' Attribute

   The 'href' attribute contains an IRI reference interpreted relative
   to the in-scope base IRI [RFC3987].  Most protocols require URIs
   [RFC3986], so IRIs usually need to be converted to URIs before being
   dereferenced.

3.3  The 'class' Attribute

   The 'class' attribute contains a space-separated list of strings used
   to classify the outline element.

   <app> elements MAY contain any number of elements that are not
   <outline> elements, and <outline> elements MAY contain any number of
   elements that are not <outline> elements.

4.  User Agent Conformance

   Foreign markup is markup not defined by this specification.

   Software consuming APP Outline Documents MUST NOT not halt processing
   when any foreign markup is encountered.  Software MAY ignore the
   markup and process any content of foreign elements as though the
   surrounding markup were not present.  For example, software may
   process

       <app>
         <group>
            <outline text="hmm" href="http://example.com"/>
         </group>
       </app>

   as though the <group> element was not present.

   Software conforming to this specification MAY halt processing when
   documents that do not conform to the schema below are encountered.

5.  Relax NG Schema

   This schema is normative.

   start = app

   app = element app {
     anyAttribute*,
     (outline* & anyElement*)
   }

   outline = element outline {
     (textAtt | classAtt | hrefAtt), anyAttribute*,
     (outline* & anyElement*)
   }

   textAtt = attribute text { text }

   hrefAtt = attribute href { text }

   classAtt = attribute class { text }

   anyElement = element * { (anyAttribute | text | anyElement)* }

   anyAttribute = attribute * { text }

6.  Sample APP Outline Documents

   Simple APP Outline Document:

   <app>
     <outline text="baz">
       <outline href="http://example.org"/>
       <outline text="thud" href="http://example.net"/>
     </outline>
   </app>

   Valid APP Outline Document with extensions:

   <app foo="bar">
     <some-extension>hmm</some-extension>
     <outline text="baz" quux="quuux" href="http://example.com">
       <outline class="garply" text="xyzzy" href="http://example.org"/>
       <outline class="foo bar" text="thud" href="http://example.net"/>
       <some-other-extension>hmm</some-other-extension>
     </outline>
   </app>

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An APP Outline Document can be identified with the following media
   type:

   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: outline+xml
   Mandatory parameters: None.
   Optional parameters:
      "charset": This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
         parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in
         [RFC3023].
   Encoding considerations: Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in [RFC3023], section 3.2.
   Security considerations: As defined in this specification.
      In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it
      shares the same security considerations as described in [RFC3023],
      section 10.
   Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
      issues.
   Published specification: This specification.
   Applications that use this media type: No known applications
      currently use this media type.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s): As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC3023],
      section 3.2.
   File extension: .ao
   Fragment identifiers: As specified for "application/xml" in
      [RFC3023], section 5.
   Base URI: As specified in [RFC3023], section 6.
   Macintosh File Type code: TEXT
   Person and email address to contact for further information: Robert
      Sayre <rfsayre@boswijck.com>
   Intended usage: COMMON
   Author/Change controller: IESG
