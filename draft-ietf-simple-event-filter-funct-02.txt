Abstract

   The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications
   of changes to a state of a resource.  The document does not describe
   a mechanism of how filtering of event notification information can be
   achieved.

   This document describes the operations a subscriber performs in order

   to define filtering rules associated with event notification
   information.  The handling of responses to subscriptions carrying
   filtering rules and the handling of notifications with filtering
   rules applied to them is described.  The document also describes how
   the notifier behaves when receiving such filtering rules and how a
   notification is constructed.

1.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',
   'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

2.  Introduction

   SIP event notification is described in [3].  It defines a general
   framework for sending subscriptions and receiving notifications in
   SIP based systems.  It introduces the concept of event packages,
   which are concrete applications of the general event framework to a
   specific usage of events.

   Filtering is a mechanism for controlling the content of event
   notifications.  Additionally, the subscriber may specify the rules
   for when a notification should be sent to it.  The filtering
   mechanism is expected to be particularly valuable to users of mobile
   wireless access devices.  The characteristics of the devices
   typically include high latency, low bandwidth, low data processing
   capabilities, small display, and limited battery power.  Such devices
   can benefit from the ability to filter the amount of information
   generated at the source of the event notification.  However,
   implementers need to be aware of the computational burden on the
   source of the event notification.  This is discussed further in
   Section 7.

   It is stated in [3] that the notifier may send a NOTIFY at any time,
   but typically it is sent when the state of the resource changes.  It
   also states that the notifications would contain the complete and
   current state of the resource authorized for a certain subscriber to
   see.  The format of such resource state information is package
   specific.  In this memo, we assume that the NOTIFY for any package
   contains an XML document.

   This document presents a mechanism for filtering whereby a subscriber
   describes its preference of when notifications are to be sent to it
   and what they are to contain.  It also describes how the notifier
   functions when generating notifications by taking into account
   filters and default functionality of the package/service.

   The XML format for defining the filter is described in [5].

3.  Client Operation

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


3.1  Transport Mechanism

   Transportation of the filter to the server is achieved by inserting
   the XML document, as defined in [5], in the body of the SUBSCRIBE
   request.  Alternatively, the XML document can be uploaded to the
   server using means outside the scope of this document.

3.2  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   SIP entities compliant with this specification MUST support the
   content type 'application/simple-filter+xml'.

3.3  Subscriber Generating SUBSCRIBE Requests

   This section presents additional functionality required from the
   subscriber when filters are used in the bodies of the SUBSCRIBE
   requests.  Normal operations of services, e.g., as defined in [7],
   [9] and [4] are otherwise followed.

   As defined in [3], the SUBSCRIBE message MAY contain a body.  This
   body would serve the purpose of carrying filtering information.
   Honouring those filters is at the discretion of the notifier and
   might depend on local policies.

   No content in the body of a SUBSCRIBE indicates to the notifier that
   no filter is being requested so that the notifier is instructed to
   send all the NOTIFY requests using the notifier's own or service
   specific policy.  Note that e.g.  in the list case [4] the filter
   might have been uploaded to the server beforehand (by means outside
   the scope of this document).

   If the body of the SUBSCRIBE includes the filter, the body MUST be of
   the MIME-Type 'application/simple-filter+xml'.

3.3.1  Structure of a Filter

   Multiple filters MAY be included in one SUBSCRIBE.  This is achieved
   by including multiple <filter> elements in the filter [5].  Each
   <filter> element may include a URI attribute.

   A SUBSCRIBE request destined to a list URI [4] MAY include multiple
   filters specific to individual resources.  This is achieved by
   including multiple <filter> elements with different URIs of resources
   in each of those elements.  This resource specific filter overrides
   any list specific filter, if any.  The list specific filter may or
   may not include a URI.

   Furthermore, regardless whether the SUBSCRIBE is destined to a list



Khartabil, et al.       Expires February 9, 2005                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


   URI or not, there can only be one filter applicable to a single
   resource or domain within a single SUBSCRIBE.  I.e.  Each filter
   within a subscription MUST uniquely identify one resource or one
   domain.

3.3.2  Request-URI vs. Filter URI

   The URI in the filter defines the target resource, e.g.  in the
   Presence service case; it is the presentity's presence information to
   which the filter is applied.  The subscriber MAY choose to leave the
   URI in the filter undefined.  If the URI is not defined within the
   filter, the filter applies to the resource identified in the
   Request-URI.  Similarly, the subscriber MAY define a filter URI.  If
   the Request-URI is a list URI [4], the filter URI MUST be the list
   URI, a sub-list URI or resource who's URI is one of the URIs that
   result from a lookup, by an RLS, on the Request-URI.  If not, the
   filter may be ignored or may be rejected.  URI matching is done
   according to the matching rules defined for a particular scheme (SIP
   URI matching rules are defined in RFC3261 [2].

   A filter may also be addressed to a domain using the "domain"
   attribute instead of the "uri" attribute.  In this case, the filter
   applies to resources in that domain.  This can be used when a
   subscription is for a resource that is an event list with many
   resources from differing domains.  If an individual resource specific
   filter is present along with the domain filter, this resource
   specific filter overrides any domain specific filter, if any.

3.3.3  Changing Filters within a Dialog

   The client MAY reset or change the filter by re-issuing a new
   SUBSCRIBE request within the existing dialog.  A SUBSCRIBE within the
   exiting dialog that does not contain a filter is assumed to maintain
   existing filters.  This means that filters are persistent and are
   only explicitly removed.

   A client requiring removal of a filter may do so by using the
   'remove="true"' attribute as defined in [5].

   In the case the URI in the filter is that of a list, a client may
   override the existing filter with a filter for an individual
   resource, that is part of the list subscribed to earlier, by issuing
   a new SUBSCRIBE within the existing dialog and including a filter
   specific for that individual resource.  The new filter need not
   include the original filter since a filter is only removed in the
   manner indicated above.

   A filter is replaced by the client re-issuing the filter using the

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


   same filter ID and replacing the contents of the filter.  Replacing a
   filter by changing the filter ID and keeping the resource URI is
   considered an error since this causes the server to assume that two
   filters are placed for the same resource.

3.3.4  Subscriber Interpreting SIP responses

   The SUBSCRIBE request will be confirmed with a final response.  A
   200-class responses indicate that the subscription has been accepted,
   and that a NOTIFY will be sent immediately.  A "200" response
   indicates that the subscription has been accepted and the filter is
   accepted.  A "202" response merely indicates that the subscription
   has been understood, the content type has been accepted, and that
   authorization may or may not have been granted.  A "202" response
   also indicates that the filter has not been accepted yet.  The
   acceptance of the filter MAY arrive in a subsequent NOTIFY.

   A non-200 class final responses indicate that no subscription or
   dialog has been created, and no subsequent NOTIFY message will be
   sent.  All non-200 class final responses have the same meanings and
   handling as described in [2] and [3].

   Specifically, a "415" response indicates that the MIME type
   'application/simple-filter+xml' is not understood by the notifier.  A
   "488" response indicates that the content type (filter) is understood
   but some aspects of it were either not understood or not accepted.

3.4  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   If the 2xx response was returned for the SUBSCRIBE, the NOTIFY that
   follows MAY contain a body that describes the present state of the
   resource after the filters have been applied.

   If the NOTIFY indicates that a subscription has been terminated [3],
   the subscription is assumed to be terminated.  Behaviour in such
   events is also described in [3].

   If the subscription is indicated as active, NOTIFY requests are
   handled as described in package specific documents and [3].

4.  Resource List Server Behaviour

   The Resource List Server is defined in [4].  This section describes
   how such entity behaves in the presence of a filter in a subscription
   to a list.

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


4.1  Request-URI vs. Filter URI

   If the URI is not defined within the filter, the filter applies to
   the resource list identified in the Request-URI.  I.e.  the filter
   applies to all the notifications that the RLS issues.  If the URI
   indicated by the filter is a list URI matching that of the
   request-URI, the filter applies to all the notifications that the RLS
   issues.

   If the URI indicated by the filter is for one resource who's URI is
   one of the URIs that result from a lookup, by the RLS, on the
   Request-URI, the filter for that particular resource is extracted and
   propagated in the SUBSCRIBE request sent to that resource.  It is
   possible to have more than one filter in a SUBSCRIBE request body,
   and therefore a filter specific to a resource MUST be extracted and
   only that is propagated.  For example, if the Request-URI  in a
   SUBSCRIBE has the value "sip:mybuddies@mydomain.com" where
   "bob@mydomain.com" is a resource belonging to that list, and the URI
   in a filter is "sip:bob@mydomain.com", the filter specific for Bob is
   extracted and placed in the body of the SUBSCRIBE sent to
   "bob@mydomain.com".

   If the URI indicated by the filter is for one resource who's URI is
   NOT under the RLS administrative control, the RLS propagates the
   filter to all the fanned out subscriptions sent to destinations
   outside the administrative domain of the RLS.  This is to accommodate
   the scenario where the subscriber knows that there are sub-lists in
   the event list that are under a different administrative domain than
   where the original subscription was sent to, and the subscriber
   wishes to set a filter for a resource in that sub-list.

   If the URI indicated by the filter is for one resource who's URI is
   under the RLS administrative control but is not part of the resource
   list that the subscription was addressed to, the filter is not
   propagated.  In this case, it is the RLS responsibility to make sure
   than this filter is applied to notifications issued, if information
   about that resource is present.

   For example: If we have 2 lists, each located on its own RLS:

   List1 (list1@example1.com) on RLS1 has: bob@example1.com
   list2@example2.com

   List2 on RLS2 has: alice@example2.com sarah@example1.com
   (Note: list2 is a resource in list1)

   RLS1 receives the following SUBSCRIBE request (the SUBSCRIBE is for
   addressed to list1 and contains 2 filters: one for sarah@example1.com

   and the other for alice@example2.com):


   SUBSCRIBE sip:List1@example1.com SIP/2.0
   ...
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <filter-set xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-filter">
     <ns-bindings>
       <ns-binding prefix="pidf" urn="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"/>
     </ns-bindings>
     <filter id="999" uri="sip:sarah@example1.com">
       <what>
         <include type="namespace">
           urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf</include>
         <exclude>
           //pidf:tuple/pidf:note</exclude>
       </what>
     </filter>
     <filter id="8439" uri="sip:alice@example2.com">
       <what>
         <include>
           //pidf:tuple/pidf:status/pidf:basic</include>
       </what>
     </filter>
   </filter-set>


   RLS1 fans out subscriptions to resources on list1.  The text above
   suggests that if a filter is destined to a resource that is not part
   of the list and is outside the administrative domain of an RLS, then
   that filter is propagated.  The rest are consumed.  In our example,
   only the filter to alice@example2.com is propagated since
   example2.com is not under the administrative domain of RLS1.  The
   filter to sarah@example1.com is consumed, and RLS1 needs to apply
   that filter to notifications it receives.

   URI matching is done according to the matching rules defined for a
   particular scheme (SIP URI matching rules are defined in RFC3261
   [2].

   A filter may also be addressed to a domain using the "domain"
   attribute instead of the "uri" attribute.  In this case, the filter
   applies to resources in that domain and the RLS MUST NOT apply
   filters to any notifications it sends, but instead MUST forward the
   filter with all fanned out subscriptions to the notifiers.

   As indicated in Section 3.3.1, multiple filters can be present in a
   SUBSCRIBE request.  Filters can also be added or modified as

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


   indicated in Section 3.3.3.  In such circumstances, an RLS MUST check
   that there are no filters addressed to the same resource or domain
   and if so, it MUST reject the SUBSCRIBE request with a "488" error
   response.

4.2  Changing Filters within a Dialog

   If an RLS receives a subscription refresh request with no filters
   specified (empty payload), the RLS assumes that the client does not
   wish to update the filters.  If an RLS receives a subscription
   refresh with a filter containing the 'remove="true"' attribute as
   defined in [5], the RLS assumes that the client is removing that
   filter identified by the filter ID.

   If an RLS receives a subscription refresh request with a filter that
   already exists (I.e.  having the same filter ID), the RLS interprets
   it as a replacement of the existing filter.  Replacing a filter by
   changing the filter ID and keeping the resource URI is considered an
   error since this causes the RLS to assume that two filters are placed
   for the same resource.

5.  Server Operation

5.1  NOTIFY Bodies

   SIP entities compliant with this specification MUST support
   content-type 'application/simple-filter+xml'.

5.2  Notifier Processing SUBSCRIBE Requests

   This section presents additional functionality required from the
   notifier when filters are used in the bodies of the SUBSCRIBE
   requests.  Normal package specific functionality are otherwise
   followed.

   The notifier will examine the content type header and will return a
   415 response if it does not understand the content type 'application/
   simple-filter+xml'.

   A 200-class responses indicate that the subscription has been
   accepted, and the NOTIFY will be sent immediately.  A "200" response
   indicates that the subscription has been accepted, the user is
   authorized and the filter is accepted.  A "202" response merely
   indicates that the subscription has been understood, but the
   authorization may or may not have been granted.  A "202" response
   also indicates that the filters have not been accepted yet.  The
   acceptance of the filters MAY arrive in a subsequent NOTIFY.

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


   Procedures described in section Section 5.4 are followed if an error
   is encountered.

   As indicated in Section 3.3.1, multiple filters can be present in a
   SUBSCRIBE request.  Filters can also be added or modified as
   indicated in Section 3.3.3.  In such circumstances, a server MUST
   check that there are no filters addressed to the same resource or
   domain and if so, it MUST reject the SUBSCRIBE request with a "488"
   error response.

5.2.1  Request-URI vs. Filter URI

   The subscriber may have chosen to leave the URI in the filter
   undefined.  If the URI is not defined within the filter, the filter
   applies to the resource identified in the Request-URI.

   Similarly, the subscriber may have chosen to include a URI in the
   filter.  In this case, the filter applies to all notifications send
   for this subscription.  If the Request-URI and the URI in the filter
   mismatch, the filter may be ignored or may be rejected.  URI matching
   is done according to the matching rules defined for a particular
   scheme (SIP URI matching rules are defined in RFC3261 [2].

   A filter may also be addressed to a domain using the "domain"
   attribute instead of the "uri" attribute.  In this case, the filter
   applies to resources in that domain.  The notifier MUST NOT apply
   filters to any notifications it sends if the domain is not that of
   its own, and MUST ignore it.  Notifiers belonging to the domain MUST
   apply the filter to all notifications it sends for that subscription,
   unless policy dictates otherwise.

5.2.2  Changing Filters within a Dialog

   If a server receives a subscription refresh request with no filters
   specified (empty payload), it assumes that the client does not wish
   to update the filters.  If it receives a subscription refresh with a
   filter containing the 'remove="true"' attribute as defined in [5],
   the server assumes that the client is removing that filter identified
   by the filter ID.

   If the server receives a subscription refresh request with a filter
   that already exists (I.e.  having the same filter ID), it interprets
   it as a replacement of the existing filter.  Replacing a filter by
   changing the filter ID and keeping the resource URI is considered an

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


5.3  Notifier Generating NOTIFY Requests

   Upon receiving the SUBSCRIBE with the filter, the notifier SHOULD
   retain the filter as long as the subscription persists.  The filter
   MAY be incorporated within an existing subscription (in an active
   dialog) by sending a re-SUBSCRIBE that includes the filter in the
   body.

   If the response sent to the SUBSCRIBE was a "202" and the "202" was
   chosen because the filter could not be accepted that time, the NOTIFY
   MAY be used to terminate the subscription if the filter was found
   unacceptable.

   As described in [3], the NOTIFY message MAY contain a body that
   describes the state of the resource.  This body is in one of the
   formats listed in the Accept header of the SUBSCRIBE, or the package
   specific default if the Accept header is omitted.

5.3.1  Generation of NOTIFY Contents

   If the NOTIFY being sent is the immediate one sent after a 2xx
   response to the original SUBSCRIBE, its contents MUST be populated
   according to the filter unless the NOTIFY request is following a
   "202" response to the SUBSCRIBE request and is terminating the
   subscription.  If applying  the filter results in not sending a
   NOTIFY, the NOTIFY MUST be sent with empty contents.  A notifier may
   also choose not to obey the filter in the first NOTIFY and instead
   send the configured value authorised for that subscriber set by the
   notifier using means outside the scope of this document).

   The input to the content filter is a package specific XML document,
   e.g.  [6] and [8] derived according to the package specific
   specifications, ([7] and [9]).

   The content is filtered according to the expressions in the <what>
   element of the filter.  The expression indicates the delivered XML
   elements and/or attributes.  Prefixes of the namespaces of the items
   of the XML document to be filtered must be expanded before applying
   the filter to the items.

   The expression directly states the XML elements and attributes to be
   delivered in the NOTIFY, along with their values.  In addition to the
   selected contents also the namespaces of all the selected items are
   included in the NOTIFY.  The XML elements and/or attributes indicated
   by the expression in the <what> element must be items that the
   subscriber is authorised to see.  If not, the notifier policy
   dictates the behaviour of the notifier (notifier can either ignore
   the filter, parts of the filter, or reject the filter completely).

Internet-Draft    Functional Description of Filtering        August 2004


   Implementers need to carefully consider such an implementation
   decision; the subscriber may not be aware of the authorised contents
   and therefore most likely will include a filter requesting
   unauthorised contents.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that notifiers
   just ignores the parts of the filter where it is requesting
   unauthorised info.  I.e.  The filter in the <filter> element where
   the unauthorised contents are requested is ignored.  If polite
   blocking is used by the notifier, the notifier may choose to ignore
   the filter, by choosing to deliver notifications containing bogus
   information in the unauthorised elements or attributes.

   The resultant XML document MUST be well formed and valid according to
   the XML schema.  This means that all mandatory elements and
   attributes along with their values MUST be included in the XML
   document regardless of the expression.  In other words, if the
   results of applying a filter on an XML document is a non-valid XML
   document, the notifier MUST add elements and attributes, along with
   their values, from the original XML document into the newly
   formulated one in order for it to be a valid one.

5.3.2  Handling of Notification Triggering Rules

   There can be several <trigger> elements inside one <filter> element.
   If the criteria for any of the <trigger> elements are satisfied, a
   NOTIFY SHOULD be generated.

   The items (XML elements and/or attributes) indicated by the
   expression in the <changed> element, <added> element or <removed>
   element must be items that the subscriber is authorised to access.
   If not, the notifier policy dictates the behaviour of the notifier
   (notifier can either ignore the filter, parts of the filter, or
   reject the filter completely).

5.4  Handling Abnormal Cases

   In case of an invalid filter definition where the XML document of the
   filter is not aligned with the XML schema of the filter format[5],
   the notifier rejects the SUBSCRIBE request with a "488" response.  A
   warning header in the response may give better indication why the
   filters were not accepted.  If the subscription was accepted with a
   "202" response but the invalid filter was discovered after that, a
   NOTIFY with a subscription-state of value 'terminated' is sent.  An
   event-reason-value "badfilter", introduced here, of subexp-params [3]
   MAY be included.

   In case of an erroneous expression in the filter definition the
   notifier either ignores the filter definition or terminates the
   subscription.



Khartabil, et al.       Expires February 9, 2005               [Page 13]


   If a <what> or <trigger> element is empty, the notifier proceeds as
   if the element did not exist.

6.  Examples

   The following chapters include filtering examples for Presence and
   Watcher Information.  The format of filter is according to [5].

6.1  Presence Specific Examples

   This chapter describes three use cases where the presence information
   filtering solution is utilised [7].  In the first use case the
   watcher is interested in getting messaging specific information of a
   certain presentity.  In the second use case the watcher is interested
   in getting information about the communication means and contact
   addresses the presentity is currently available for communication on.
   The third case shows how a presentity can request triggers to receive
   notifications

   Below is the Presentity's presence information in PIDF [6].  It
   includes two tuples: one for the instant messaging and another for
   the voice related information.
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
                           xmlns:rpid="urn:ietf:params:ns:rpid-tuple"
                           entity="sip:presentity@domain.com">

               </status>
               <rpid:class>im</rpid:class>
               <contact>im:presentity@domain.com</contact>
            </tuple>
            <tuple id="thr76jk">
               <status>
                  <basic>open</basic>
               </status>

            </tuple>
         </presence>


6.1.1  Subscriber Requests Messaging Related Information

   The subscriber initiates a subscription to the presentity's messaging
   (MMS, IM and SMS) related presence information.  The subscription
   includes the content limiting filter.

   The filtered content is indicated with an expression.  This

   expression selects the <basic>  element and all the parent elements
   (this means the status, tuple and its root element), the <class>
   element and the <contact> element.  The filter is: <class> elements
   that have values beginning with "MMS", "SMS" or "IM".

   In this case, the notification includes the contents of the tuple
   that has the value "IM" in its <label> element.

   SUBSCRIBE request from the subscriber including filter:

6.1.2  Subscriber Fetches Information about "Open" Communication Means

   The subscriber makes a subscription to the presentity's available
   communication means.  The subscription includes the content limiting
   filter.

   The filtered content is indicated with an expression.  This
   expression selects the <basic>  element and all the parent elements
   (this means the status, tuple and its root element), the <class>
   element and the <contact> element.  The filter is: the <basic>
   element's value is "Open".  There is also a need to indicate that
   only the tuples which have contact address information are selected.

   In this case the notification returns the contents of the tuple that
   has both the value "open" inside the <status> element and the
   existing <contact> elements.

   SUBSCRIBE request from the subscriber including filter:

   'terminated'.  In the notification, only the watchers that have a
   status of 'terminated' and an event of 'rejected' are included.

   SUBSCRIBE request from the Watcher Subscriber including the filter:

7.  Security Considerations

   The presence of filters in the body in a SIP message has a
   significant effect on the ways in which the request is handled at a
   server.  As a result, it is especially important that messages
   containing this extension be authenticated and authorized.

   Processing of requests and looking up filters requires set operations
   and searches, which can require some amount of computation.  This
   enables a DoS attack whereby a user can send requests with
   substantial numbers messages with large contents, in the hopes of
   overloading the server.  To counter this, the server MUST establish a
   limit on the number of occurrences of the  <what>, <changed>, <added>
   and <removed> elements allowed in the filters.  A default limit of 20
   is RECOMMENDED, however, servers MAY raise or lower the limit
   depending upon their specific engineered capacity.

   Requests can reveal sensitive information about a UA's capabilities.
   If this information is sensitive, it SHOULD be encrypted using SIP S/
   MIME capabilities.



Khartabil, et al.       Expires February 9, 2005               [Page 26]


   Propagating filters in SUBSCRIBE requests to foreign domains reveals
   sensitive information about a user's resource lists.  It is therefore
   required that an RLS does not forward a filter if that filter is
   addressed to a resource that is under the administrative domain of
   the RLS, but is not on the resource list.  Section 4.1 shows an
   example where such a scenario can occur.

   All package specific security measures MUST be followed.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A new event-reason-value "badfilter" is defined to represent the
   event where the filter is not well formed and/or not accepted.  No
   IANA registration is required for this value.
