   Abstract 
         
         
        Mobile IPv4 message types range from 0 to 255. This document 
        reserves a message type for use by an individual, company, or 
        organization for experimental purpose, to evaluate enhancements 
        to Mobile IPv4 messages before formal standards proposal.

   1. Introduction  
 
 
        Mobile IPv4 message types range from 0 to 255. This document 
        reserves a message type for use by an individual, company, or 
        organization for experimental purpose, to evaluate enhancements 
        to Mobile IPv4 messages before formal standards proposal. 
         
        Without experimental message capability, one would have to 
        select a type value from the range defined for IANA assignment, 
        which may result in collision. 
         
        To eliminate the collision possibility among vendors, the new 
        experimental   message   contains   the   vendor/organization      
        identifier to maintain their own message space. 
          
    
   2. Terminology 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
        NOT",  "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT",  "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and 
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
        in [1].  
           
        EXP-MSG-TYPE: A message in the range [0-255] TBD by IANA for 
        experimental use. 
         
         
   3. Experimental Message 
         
 
        Since the nature and purpose of an experimental message cannot 
        be known in advance, the structure is designed to avoid vendor 
        overlap and provide opaque payload, which can be properly 
        interpreted by the entity defining the message.

        These messages will be used between the mobility entities (Home 
        Agent, Foreign Agent, and Mobile Node). Experimental messages 
        SHOULD  be  authenticated  using  any  of  the  authentication 
        mechanism defined for Mobile IP ([2], [5]).  
         
        This message MAY contain extensions defined in Mobile IP, 
        including vendor specific extensions [4]. 
       
       
        IP fields: 
           Source Address Typically the interface address from which 
           the message is sent. 
       
           Destination Address The address of the agent or the Mobile    
           Node. 
       
        UDP fields: 
       
            Source Port variable 
       
            Destination Port 434 
       
        Mobile IP fields shown below follow the UDP header:

                 The high-order octet is 0 and the low-order 3 octets 
                 are the SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code 
                 of the Vendor in network byte order, as defined in the 
                 Assigned Numbers RFC [3]. 
         
        Opaque     The Opaque is zero or more octets.

   4. Mobility Entity Considerations 
    
        Mobility entities can send and receive experimental messages. 
        Implementations that don't understand the message type or the 
        Vendor/Org-ID SHOULD silently discard the message. 
    
    
   5. IANA Considerations 
    
        IANA services are required for this draft. Since a new message 
        type is needed to be reserved as experimental, a value must be 
        assigned for EXP-MSG-TYPE from Mobile IP control message space. 
         
         
   6. Security Considerations 
         
        Like all Mobile IP control messages, the experimental messages  
        SHOULD  be  authenticated  with  at  least  one  authenticator. 
        Messages without a valid authenticator SHOULD be discarded. 
         
    
   7. Intellectual Property Rights 
    
        The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of 
        any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed 
        to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology 
        described in this document or the extent to which any license 
        under such rights might or might not be available; neither does 
        it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such 
        rights.  Information on the IETF's procedures with respect to 
        rights in standards-track and standards-related documentation 
        can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of claims of rights made 
        available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be 
        made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a 
        general license or permission for the use of such proprietary 
        rights by implementors or users of this specification can be 
        obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
         
        The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention 
        any  copyrights,  patents  or  patent  applications,  or  other 
        proprietary rights which may cover technology that may be 
        required  to  practice  this  standard.    Please  address  the 
        information to the IETF Executive Director.
