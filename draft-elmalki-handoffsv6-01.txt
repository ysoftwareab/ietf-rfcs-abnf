Abstract

   This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in Mobile
   IPv6. Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv6 in order to limit
   the period of service disruption experienced by a wireless Mobile
   Node when moving between access routers. This requirement becomes
   even more important when supporting real-time services. Fast
   Handoffs involve anticipating the movement of MNs and sending
   multiple copies of the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement
   locations. Both flat and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 models are
   considered. The Hierarchical MIPv6 mobility Management model in [1]
   already offers improvements to Mobile IP handoffs by providing a
   local Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) functionality. Some additions
   are made to the operation of this existing Hierarchical model to
   achieve Fast Handoffs.

1. Introduction

   Fast Handoffs anticipate the movement of wireless Mobile Nodes
   (MNs) by utilizing simultaneous bindings in order to send multiple
   copies of the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement locations.
   In this way, Fast Handoffs coupled to layer 2 mobility can help in
   achieving seamless handoffs between Access Routers (ARs) by
   eliminating the delay period required to perform a Registration
   following a Mobile IP handoff.
   An alternative method to perform improved handoffs, namely Smooth
   Handoffs, is described in [2]. The method for Fast Handoff
   addresses the need to support services having strict delay bounds
   (i.e. real-time) which in certain cases may be hard to support if
   traffic has to be forwarded between ARs using Smooth Handoffs.
   Also, in the non-realtime case it may be possible that the new AR
   receives buffered traffic from the previous AR (smooth handoff)and
   traffic from the CN contemporarily which could cause some out-of-
   order and delayed packets to be delivered to the MN. In some cases
   this may affect the performance of higher level protocols (i.e. TCP).
   This same situation will not arise using Fast Handoffs.

   This draft considers both the normal Mobile IPv6 model [2] and the
   hierarchical Mobile IPv6 model [1]. These are shown in Figure 1
   where the Access Points (APs) or Radio Access Networks (RANs) are
   used to provide a MN with wireless L2 access.

   Simultaneous bindings are described in this draft and may be
   achieved by setting a new, "B" flag in the BU sent by the MN to a
   MAP. In this way, the MAP will add a new binding for the MN
   without removing the existing entry.

   Hence packets arriving to the MAP will be tunnelled to both addresses
   in its Binding Cache.

              model


   The method to anticipate MN movement by interacting with the wireless
   L2 is described later in this draft.

   The Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 scheme introduced in [1] allows a Mobile
   Node to perform registrations locally with a MAP in order to reduce
   the number of signalling messages to the home network and CNs. This
   achieves a reduction in the signalling delay when a Mobile Node moves
   between ARs and therefore improves the performance of such handoffs.
   This draft describes Fast Handoffs in Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   (HMIPv6) as well as a flat network architecture.
   When considering a MIPv6 handoff, two different cases can be
   considered depending on the network architecture:

      - The previous and new AR are physically connected
      - The previous and new AR are connected via N other nodes or
      networks

   The first case can be considered a subset of the more generic
   case (second). Hence the solution proposed will be addressing the
   generic (second) case.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Fast Handoffs in MIPv6            November 2000


2. Fast Handoffs overview

   Fast Handoffs address the need to achieve seamless Mobile IP
   Handoffs when the MN moves between ARs. This is done by "bicasting"
   traffic to the "previous" AR and "new" AR while the MN is moving
   between them. The anticipation of the MN's movement is achieved by
   tight coupling with Layer 2 functionality which is
   dependent on the type of access technology used. The coupling between
   L2 and L3 technologies may occur in the network nodes or the MNs, or
   both, depending on the access technology. "Bicasting" is achieved
   through simultaneous bindings, where the MN activates the "B" flag in
   the MAP registration. When a MAP Registration has the "B" flag set,
   the receiving MAP, which has an existing binding for the MN, will add
   the relevant new binding for the MN  but will also maintain any
   existing binding it had for the MN.

   Two different handoff scenarios are considered in this draft:

      -  A MN having to do a handoff between two different ARs with
         which it can be simultaneously data-connected (eg. Two
         different access technologies). In this case it may not be
         essential to request simultaneous bindings. The MN may simply
         continue using both COAs (on the old and new link) as
         specified in [2]. A MN can ensure that packets will be
         arriving at the _new_ interface after receiving a BAck from its
         HA/MAP/CNs. This can be achieved by requesting a BAck from
         these nodes. However, since the processing of BUs is not
         mandated in [1], the MN may need to keep the old interface
         live for a short period of time to ensure no more packets are
         addressed to it.

      -  A MN having to do a handoff between two access routers with
         which it can not be simultaneously data-connected.
         This is the more common case where_Fast_Handoffs can be used to
         achieve seamless mobility.

   When the MN has multiple active bindings with a MAP, it may or may
   not receive multiple copies of the same traffic directed to it.
   The use of simultaneous bindings does not necessarily mean that
   the MN is receiving packets contemporarily from multiple sources.
   This depends on the characteristics of the access (L2) technology.
   The "bicasting" of packets, combined with the anticipation of the new
   COA is used to and speed up handoffs by sending a copy of the data to
   the AR which the MN is moving to. Until the MN actually completes the
   L2 handoff to the new AR, the data "copy" reaching this AR may be
   discarded. In this way the total handoff delay is limited to the time
   needed to perform the L2 handoff. Thus, Fast Handoffs coupled to the
   L2 access potentially result in loss-less IP-layer mobility. As
   described in chapter 2.1, depending on the L2 characteristics, it is
   also possible for an MN to initiate a Fast Handoff through the
   "previous" AR without having direct access to the "new" AR.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Fast Handoffs in MIPv6            November 2000





2.1  Initiating Fast Handoffs through the "previous" AR

   In the case in which the wireless L2 technology allows the MN to be
   data-connected to multiple wireless access points simultaneously,
   the MN may solicit advertisements from ARs before completing a
   handoff. In this case "bicasting" may not be necessary.

   Some existing wireless L2 technologies and their implementations
   do not allow a MN to be data-connected to multiple wireless access
   points simultaneously. Thus, in order to perform a Fast Handoff it is
   necessary for some form of interworking between layers 2 and 3.
   It should be noted that the method by which an AR determines when
   a MN has initiated a L2 handoff is outside the scope of this
   draft and may involve interaction with L2 messaging. Also, the
   interaction between L2 and L3 should allow the Mobile Node to
   perform a L2 handoff only after having performed the L3 Fast
   Handoff described in this draft. That is, the L2 handoff may be
   performed after the MN's Registration with the "new" AR which
   produces a simultaneous binding at the MAP. This Registration
   may be transmitted more than once to reduce the probability that
   it is lost due to errors on the wireless link. Alternatively, the MN
   may choose to send a BU to the MAP with the_A flag set.

   A Fast Handoff in this case requires the MN to receive "new" router
   advertisements through the "old" wireless access points, and to
   perform a registration with the "new" AR through the "old"
   wireless access point. Two ways of performing this follow.

   I.   Inter-AR Solicitation

   This solution assumes that the AR with which the MN is currently
   registered is aware of the IP address of the "new" AR which the MN is
   moving to. The method by which the current AR is informed of this may
   depend on interaction with L2 and is outside the scope of this draft.

   In some wireless networks, an AR may not be closely coupled to the
   radio link layer protocols. In these scenarios the initiation of the
   handoff my need to be done by the MN.
   Based on L2 indications, the MN may solicit the router for a special
   advertisement that includes the "new" subnet prefix(es). To indicate
   the need for such special advertisement, the solicitation message
   would need to include a new option showing an identifier for the
   "new" AP. This identifier may then be mapped in the AR to a
   neighbouring or the current subnet. Hence the appropriate information
   can be communicated to the MN.

   Once the current AR is aware of the address of the AR which the MN




El-Malki and Soliman                                            [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Fast Handoffs in MIPv6            November 2000


   will move to, it will solicit the "new" AR for a router advertisemnt.
   The "new" AR will reply to the current AR by sending it a router
   advertisement with appropriate extensions. The current AR will then
   send the anticipated prefixes for the "new" subnet to the MN's unicast
   address. As a consequence, the MN, being eager to perform new
   bindings, will send a BU to the MAP to request that packets addressed
   to it be bicasted to both the "old" and "new" addresses.

   It should be noted that problems may arise if the current AR and the
   "new" AR are not sharing the same link. In this scenario, sending a
   router solicitation to the "new" AR would mean that the solicitation
   and advertisement messages need to be routed beyond the subnet scope.

   This scenario is not allowed in [5] to avoid ARP-like attacks in
   IPv4. However, it may be possible for the old AR to send a
   solicitation message to the new AR if the following conditions are
   met:

   - The source and destination addresses in the message are of site-
     local or global scope.
   - The AR MUST NOT add its link layer address in the solicitation
     message.
   - The solicitation message and the router advertisement both contain
     sufficient authentication and authorisation information for both
     routers. This can be achieved by having one common secret shared
     between a cluster of ARs within a domain. Such secret can be used
     to process AH which can be added to the solicitation/advertisement
     messages.

   Added security can be established by setting up a permanent tunnell
   between the two ARs.

   If all the above conditions are met it should be possible for router
   solicitations/advertisemnts to be routed beyond the subnet scope.

   II.  Piggy-backing Advertisements on L2 messaging

   Let us take Figure 1 as an example, where a MN initiates an L2
   handoff from AP/RAN1 to AP/RAN2 (Note that it may not be the MN
   which takes decisions on handoffs). It is assumed that when an L2
   handoff is initiated, AP/RAN1 and AP/RAN2 perform L2 messaging
   procedures to negotiate the L2 handoff. Since the MN is not
   attached to AP/RAN2 yet, AR2 is unaware of the IP address of the
   MN and cannot send an advertisement to it. Therefore it is
   necessary for the L2 procedures to interwork with Mobile IP.

   Once a L2 handoff is initiated, such that AP/RAN2 and AP/RAN1 are
   in communication, it is possible for AP/RAN2 to solicit an
   advertisement from AR2 and transfer it to AP/RAN1. Once this is
   received by the MN, the MN can send a BU to the MAP using an AR2 COA
   even though the MN has no data-connection to AP/RAN2 yet.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Fast Handoffs in MIPv6            November 2000



   The precise definition of such L2 procedures is outside the scope
   of Mobile IP.

3. Fast Handoffs in HMIPv6

   HMIPv6 is described in [1]. Fast IP Handoffs can be achieved in a
   very simple and efficient manner.
   When the MN receives a router Advertisement including a MAP option,
   as specified in [1], it should perform actions according to the
   following movement detection mechanisms. In a Hierarchical Mobile IP
   network such as the one described in this draft, the MN MUST be:

      - "Eager" to perform new bindings
      - "Lazy" in releasing existing bindings

   The above means that the MN will perform bindings with any "new" MAP
   advertised by the AR (Eager).
   The method by which the MN determines whether the MAP is a "new" MAP
   is described in [1]. However the MN should not release existing
   bindings until it no longer receives its MAP option or the lifetime
   of its existing binding expires (Lazy).

   If the MN has at least one existing binding with a MAP, additional
   simultaneous regional registrations will be performed requesting a
   short lifetime. This is done in order to limit the lifetime of
   bindings which the MN only needs temporarily and therefore limit
   bandwidth usage. This is the case when the MN is moving between
   ARs and uses Fast Handoffs to achieve near loss-less IP mobility. The
   lifetime of additional "auxiliary" bindings needed for Fast
   Handoffs is thus limited.

   It should be noted that the method described above is applicable to
   hierarchical and flat architectures. As described in [1], a MAP can
   exist on any level in the hierarchy, including ARs. Hence, a
   bicasting request can also be sent to a MAP located in the AR, in the
   case where no MAPs are located higher in the hierarchy.

3.1 Fast Handoffs in a flat MIPv6 architecture

   A flat MIPv6 architecture is one that does not use a static mobility
   management based hierarchy. In the context of [1], this would mean
   that no MAP functionality is deployed beyond the on-link AR. In this
   case the same concepts described above would still apply if the MAP
   function is used in the AR.

   Figure 1: Flat mobility management architecture

   In this scenario a dynamic hierarchy can be established without
   changing any of the concepts mentioned above. The handoff is
   anticipated by sending the "new" link's prefixes to the MN before L2
   handoff takes place. The MN would then send a new BU to its "old"
   MAP, located in the "old" AR, and request that all packets addressed
   to it be bicasted to its current address and the new COA.
   In this manner the "old" MAP/AR serves as an anchor point for the MN
   while it is connected to the new AR/MAP.

   This architecture is well suited to an AR serving large coverage
   areas where IP mobility may not occur very frequently. For other
   mobility scenarios where handoffs are frequent, a hierarchical
   mobility management scheme as [1] is more efficient and flexible.

4. Handling ping pong in Fast Handoffs

   Ping Pong is a term used mainly in cellular networks to describe the
   repetetive rapid movement of a mobile terminal between two APs for a
   short period of time. While this phenomenon may be transparent to the
   IP layer if both APs belong to the same coverage area of an AR, it is
   certainly an important issue to address if the APs are associated
   with two different ARs.

   To successfully avoid the negative impacts of ping pong, it is
   important to avoid sending BUs every time the MN attaches to a new
   AR. In addition it is important to avoid packet routing defficiences




El-Malki and Soliman                                            [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Fast Handoffs in MIPv6            November 2000


   which may result in packets dropped for the duration of the ping
   pong.
   Fast Handoffs can handle this phenomenon by issuing a bicast request
   through the "old" AR and before the MN moves to the "new" AR. This
   will ensure that the MN will continue receiving packets addressed to
   it irrespective of its current AR. Hence the packet losses due to IP
   mobility can be reduced to zero.
   Since the MN will have an entry in its Binding Update List (BUL)
   indicating that a BU was sent with a bicasting request, the MN will
   not need to resend BUs whenever a new router advertisement is
   received from one of the ARs it is moving in between.

5. Extensions for Fast Handoffs

5.1 Extensions to MIPv6

   To allow bicasting from the MAP to take place, a new flag,_B_, is
   added to the BU message. Upon reception of a BU message with the _B_
   flag set, a MAP SHOULD bicast all incoming packets addressed to the
   MN to its current COA as well as the new COA in the BU requesting the
   bicast. The new BU message is shown below.

6. Fast Handoffs and DAD

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) was defined in [4] to avoid address
   duplication on links when stateless address autoconfiguration is
   used. The use of DAD to verify the uniqueness of a statelessly
   configured IPv6 address may add delays to a MIPv6 handoff.
   The probability of an interface identifier duplication on the same
   subnet can be considered very low, however it can not be ignored.

   In this draft certain precautions are proposed to minimise the
   effects of a duplicate address occurrence.

   In an HMIPv6 network as described in [1], a MN can register with one
   or more MAPs while moving within one or more MAP domains. Since a MAP
   domain is likely to include more than one router, when receiving a BU
   from the MN a MAP can check if other nodes within its domain are
   using the same interface identifier or address. If address
   duplication is detected, a MAP MUST reject the BU with the approriate
   fault code.

   If a duplication of the interface identifier is found, a MAP MAY
   accept the BU and include a new code in the BAck to warn the MN from
   choosing this interface identifier value.
   As a result a MN may change the interface identifier immediately or
   before moving to a new subnet.
   This method guarantees that no address duplication will take place
   between addresses registered in the MAP.
   It should be noted that a MAP higher in the hierarchy may provide
   better address "coverage" to allow the MN to predict address
   duplication earlier.

   In the case of a flat architecture as decribed in chapter 3.1 a MAP
   will not be able to know other MN addresses outside its subnet.
   Since the MN may not register with the "new" MAP until it moves to
   the new subnet, or it may simply not register for a long time, there
   is little benefit in using the approach mentioned above.

   Hence, to avoid delays due to DAD in a flat mobility management
   architecture, a MN may choose to continue sending and receiving
   traffic using its newly formed COA while performing DAD on the new
   subnet. In the case where a duplication exists, the MN MUST follow
   the rules in [4].

   This issue is not specific to this proposal and may also be addressed
   in future revisions of [2].
