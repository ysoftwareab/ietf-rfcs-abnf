Internet-Draft  RTC-Web reqs for SIP and RTP interworking  February 2011


1.  Introduction

   In the context of [RTC-Web], some work is emerging to make real-time
   communications possible in a web browser.  Such work will allow to
   use the UDP protocol to transport real time data.

   This document defines a minimal set of requirements so that RTC-Web
   applications interoperate with applications based on SIP ([RFC3261])
   and RTP ([RFC3550]) protocols.

   On the one hand, bringing real-time communication capability in the
   web browser RTC-Web promises to offer great value to end-users,
   developers and service providers.  This value comes from the ubiquity
   of the web browser and the web architecture, from the simple
   programatic model the web offer and indeed the innovation perspective
   of such solution.

   On the other hand, SIP and RTP protocols are broadly used to
   implement real-time or near real-time applications.  This is
   particularly true for voice, video, instant messaging, presence and
   content sharing and when considering available implementations in
   devices (hard phone, mobile phone...), network infrastructures (e.g.
   SIP based architecture) and service provider interconnection
   gateways.

   Allowing both solutions to interoperate promises RTC-Web solution to
   have greater value as it will allow this solution to reach legacy SIP
   multimedia devices and networks and vice versa.

   Section 4 describes some use cases.  Section 5 reports the different
   possible architectures.  Section 6 finally states a set of
   requirements the ongoing RTC-Web solution definition should fulfil to
   be able to interoperate with SIP based multimedia applications.

   Note: This document does not directly address RTC-Web service
   provider interconnection except if this interconnection is based on
   SIP-RTP.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft  RTC-Web reqs for SIP and RTP interworking  February 2011


3.  Definitions

   RTC-WEB: the term [RTC-Web] refers to the ongoing work on defining a
   solution that enables real time applications such as bidirectional
   audio and video within web applications

   SIP-RTP: the term SIP-RTP is a generic term which refers to SIP and
   RTP ecosystem protocol stack.  This includes, non exhaustively: SIP,
   SDP, RTP, RTCP, SRTP...

   Note: To be adjusted to fit with the current on going [RTC-Web]
   charter.


4.  Use cases

   This section presents some use cases involving interworking between
   RTC-Web and SIP applications.  These use cases include scenarios
   where real-time audio and/or video are exchanged.

4.1.  SIP Multimedia application reachability extension

   Alice wants to access its services.  Her service provider A (e.g.
   atlanta.example.org) hosts these services on SIP-RTP servers.  Alice
   can use a web browser implementing an RTC-Web extension to reach its
   service.

4.2.  RTC-Web applications with integration of SIP device

   Bob wants to access its services.  His service provider B (e.g.
   biloxy.example.org) hosts these services on RTC-Web servers.  Bob can
   use a device implementing an SIP-RTP extension to reach its service.

4.3.  RTC-Web and SIP service provider interconnection

   All the users of service provider A (e.g. atlanta.example.org) use an
   RTC-Web application.  All the users of service provider B (e.g.
   biloxi.example.org) use a SIP-RTP application.  Both service
   providers want to make communications possible between all these
   users.

   This use case is typically an inter service operators use case.


5.  Possible RTC-Web/SIP interworking architectures

   This section outlines different architectures to realize RTC-Web/
   SIP-RTP interworking.  This section does not pretend to be exhaustive

   in term of architecture description but intends to propose families
   of models any kind of solution should fit in.

   These architectures satisfy the use cases listed above.  However, It
   must be noted that depending on the considered use case, additional
   components may be necessary.

   In this section, the name SIP used alone is a shortcut for SIP and
   SDP protocols.  Similarly, RTP used alone is a shortcut for RTP,
   RTCP, and SRTP protocols.

5.1.  SIP-RTP Stack in the Browser

   This architecture consists in directly implementing a SIP-RTP
   protocol stack in the browser, enabling a direct connection between
   an RTC-Web application in a browser and a SIP-RTP phone.

   Architecture with SIP-RTP in the browser:

5.2.  New Signalling Scheme and RTP Stack in the Browser

   This architecture consists in implementing a new signalling scheme
   and an RTP stack in the browser.

   A new signalling scheme means refers to two possible models:

   o  Session management data set by API and transported by an
      application protocol (e.g.  HTTP or WebSockets).  Figure 2
      illustrates such architecture with XXX as the session management
      data.  The HTTP stack shown in the figure is the regular HTTP
      stack available by default in all web browsers.  Having SIP (or
      part of it) embedded in HTTP in one possible implementation, as
      indicated in [draft-sinnreich-sip-web-apis-01].
   o  A session management protocol different from SIP (e.g.  XMPP,
      MEGACO).  Figure 3 illustrates such architecture with YYY as the
      signalling protocol.

   Both models relax constraints on the technology choice to implement
   the RTC-Web solution but add constraints on end-to-end compatibility
   with SIP-RTP applications by requiring the implementation of a
   gateway to map one protocol into another one.

5.3.  New Signalling Scheme and New Media Protocol in the Browser

   This architecture consists in implementing different protocols in
   RTC-Web and SIP-RTP frameworks, both for at the signalling level and
   at the media level.

   Such architecture requires interworking work (protocol mapping,
   gateway) both for the signalling and the media protocols.

   This architecture relaxes constraints on the technology choice to
   implement the RTC-Web solution but adds constraints on end-to-end
   compatibility with SIP-RTP applications by requiring the
   implementation of gateway(s) to adapt protocols and media payloads.

5.4.  Analysis with regards to interworking

   Using a full SIP-RTP stack in the browser (Section 5.1) would
   undoubtedly be the best solution with regards to interworking: it
   would avoid specifying new protocols and it would thus avoid the
   control plane interworking problem described in [RFC3439] (i.e. no
   need for protocol mapping).  It nevertheless requires a granular API
   to configure and access the protocol stack.

   Using the RTP protocol suite but another than the SIP protocol
   (Section 5.2) add the burden of interworking efforts at the
   signalling level.  The level of complexity of this gateway depends on
   how much the signaling protocol will look like SIP.  However, having
   HTTP (or WebSocket) as a protocol transporting the signaling data is
   attractive due to the central role played by this protocol in Web
   environments.

   Using both new signalling and media protocols in the browser
   (Section 5.3) has been presented above for the sake of exhaustiveness
   but this solution is not attractive for SIP-RTP interworking: it
   increases the interworking efforts by requiring work at the media
   level (new media protocol, complexity and cost of interworking
   gateways...), whereas adding no identified advantages with regards to
   the existing RTP/UDP protocol suite.

6.  Requirements

   Whatever the architecture solution the RTC-Web will retain, a
   reasonable way-forward is to specify its protocols and APIs taking
   care of interworking with SIP-RTP devices.  As such the following
   requirements are proposed to the RTC-Web working group:

6.1.  Generic requirements:

   GENERIC-REQ-1  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST be designed in a such way
                  it allows interworking with SIP-RTP applications both
                  at the signalling and media level.

6.2.  Signalling level requirements:

   SIG-REQ-1  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST be designed in a way it allows
              interoperability with SIP based multimedia applications.
              This is typically applicable for identifiers, credentials,
              state machine, and message types.

   SIG-REQ-2  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST include a way to negotiate
              media format as in Offer/Answer model used in SIP
              ([RFC3264])

   SIG-REQ-3  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST include a way to interoperate
              with ([RFC5939])

   SIG-REQ-4  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST allow end to end codec
              negotiation between RTC-web device and SIP device

   SIG-REQ-5  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST include a compatibility/
              mapping with SDP([RFC4566])

   SIG-REQ-6  The [RTC-Web] solution SHOULD NOT require SIP-RTP
              extensions.


6.3.  Media level requirements:

   MEDIA-REQ-1  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST be designed in a way it does
                not mandate a gateway at media level when interworking
                with SIP based multimedia application, consequently it
                must be based on RTP/RTCP protocol suite over UDP for
                real-time media.

   MEDIA-REQ-2  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST be compatible with a media
                gateway architecture and not rely exclusively on a peer
                to peer (between RTC-Web devices)...

   MEDIA-REQ-3  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST allow the configuration of
                some media-related parameters per session (e.g. buffer
                size, packetization...).


6.4.  Codec level requirements:

   CODEC-REQ-1  The [RTC-Web] solution MUST allow codecs available in
                existing SIP-RTP applications.  A non exhaustive list is
                the following: G.711, G.722, AMR, AMR-WB, H.264.



7.  Security Considerations

   SEC-REQ-1  RTC-Web and SIP-RTP interworking solution MUST NOT
              compromise inherent security feature(s) developed and used
              for both RTC-Web and SIP-RTP solutions.



8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
