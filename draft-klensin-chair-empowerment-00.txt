Abstract

   From time to time, there have been complaints about internal
   conflicts within the IESG that have retarded projects.  Some IETF
   Chairs have expressed frustration about not being able to resolve the
   problems and several members of the community have expressed
   frustration that the Chairs cannot do so.  The recall process has not
   been effective in either dealing with or deterring these problems.
   This document proposes, as a process experiment, an alternate model
   whose intent is to give the Chair some leverage on solving any such
   problems that may arise in the future.

1.  Introduction

   From time to time, there have been complaints about internal
   conflicts within the IESG that have retarded projects.  Some IETF
   Chairs have expressed frustration about not being able to resolve the
   problems and several members of the community have expressed
   frustration that the Chairs cannot do so.  The recall process has not
   been effective in either dealing with or deterring these problems.
   This document proposes, as a process experiment, an alternate model
   whose intent is to give the Chair some leverage on solving any such
   problems that may arise in the future.

   The difficulty with any mechanism that gives a Chair authority to
   discipline or remove a member of the body is how one prevents abuse.
   The model used here does not give the Chair that authority but rather
   permits the Chair to identify a difficulty so severe that an
   independent body, the Nomcom, must deal with it, either by removing
   and replacing the member involved or by removing and replacing the
   Chair.


2.  Mechanism

   The IETF Chair may, at any time, present the Nomcom Chair with a
   complaint against an IESG member.  This sets the following process in
   motion.

   1.  The Nomcom reviews the complaint and, just as it does when making
       normal selections, solicits and evaluates input from the
       community.  The evaluation is not only of the complaint but of
       the general behavior of the subject IESG member and of the IETF
       Chair.

   2.  When this evaluation is complete, the Nomcom announces a vacancy
       in either the subject IESG member's position or in the position
       of IETF Chair and then proceeds to fill that vacancy according to
       normal rules then in effect.


3.  Protection Against Abuse

   The reader should note that the procedure outlined above is a "him
   (or her) or me" procedure, not a "Chair gets to fire people" one.  It
   gives the Chair authority and responsibility to diagnose and resolve
   personality conflicts and behavior that is preventing the IESG from
   getting work done.  The complaint to the Nomcom effectively creates a
   vacancy: by initiating it, the IETF Chair puts his or her own
   position on the line.  Presumably an IETF Chair who abuses the

   mechanism will be removed instead of the subject AD.  The conflict
   will be resolved in any event.

   Note that this procedure has no impact on the recall procedure: it
   remains available to the community as specified in other documents.


4.  Experimental Evaluation

   As with the conventional recall procedure, if a mechanism of this
   type is ever used, there is already a problem within the IETF that
   fairly drastic mechanisms must be used to resolve it.  Like the
   recall procedure, this mechanism serves its purpose best when it acts
   to deter bad behavior, rather than being used as a last-resort
   remedy.  On the other hand, the recall mechanism is so drastic and
   time-consuming that it has not been used even when personality and
   stylistic conflicts have developed that have essentially paralyzed
   the IESG, with the individuals involved having no real incentives to
   figure out how to work together.  The availability of this procedure
   is expected to give individuals strong incentives to work around
   problems and work effectively together.

   The consequence of this model is that there will probably be no way
   to evaluate the procedure other than subjectively.  Certainly one
   would not expect it to be used twice in a fairly short period of
   time.  If it is used, the community will be able to evaluate the
   consequences of using it.  If it is not used, the community may be
   able to evaluate whether its existence staved off ongoing bad
   behavior or whether its existence as a standby mechanism caused harm.


5.  Some Questions and Answers

   Preliminary discussions leading up to this specification identified a
   number of questions that were asked repeatedly.  This section
   identifies those questions and responses, in question and answer
   form.

   Q: Why can only the Chair initiate this procedure?  Wouldn't it be
      better to let any IESG member initiate it?
   A: Part of the intent is to give the Chair a tool to manage an out-
      of-control IESG and the responsibility (presumably enforced only
      by the Nomcom or the recall procedure) to do so.  If different
      IESG members were able to use it on each other, there is too much
      risk of abuse or repeated invocations,

   Q: Why isn't this mechanism available to the IAB Chair, or other
      group leaders, as well?
   A: It seemed less necessary and hence better to limit the scope of
      the experiment.  The model is easily extended to other groups and
      positions if the community decides it is desirable to do so.

   Q: Couldn't an IETF Chair use this procedure to systematically
      eliminate IESG members with whom he or she did not get along?"
   A: Only if the Nomcom permitted it.  Logic and an understanding of
      human nature suggests that a Nomcom would respond to an IETF Chair
      who apparently was taking an "everyone here is a problem other
      than me" position by replacing that person, immediately
      eliminating the problem and sending a message to the selected
      successor,
