1. Introduction

   The Dynamic Link Exchange protocol [DLEP] runs between a router and
   its attached modem devices, allowing the modem to communicate radio
   link characteristics, and radio network convergence events as they
   change. This draft describes an optional extension to DLEP protocol,
   allowing for VLAN encapsulations to be implemented.

   This draft doesn't attempt to suggest or make any modifications to
   any other protocol or standard mentioned in the draft.

2. Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

Internet-Draft          VLAN Extension to DLEP               March 2016


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a statement using the key words listed above. This
   convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the
   portions of this RFC covered by these keywords.

3. Terminology

   Peer: A router and the modem with which it has established a DLEP
   session are referred to as peers.

   Neighbor: A router which is accessible via a peer's RF link.

   VLAN-ID: This is 12-bit VLAN-ID field in [802.1Q] C-TAG or [802.1AD]
   S-TAG or [802.1AH] B-TAG.

4. Overview

   This protocol extension to DLEP provides a VLAN encapsulation
   scheme. In this scheme, neighbor is characterized by the VLAN-ID. We
   propose the following encapsulation tags to DLEP data traffic.

   1. IEEE 802.1Q Tag
   2. IEEE 802.1AD Tag
   3. IEEE 802.1AH Tag

   DLEP router and modem negotiate on the encapsulation and adds the
   appropriate tag per the negotiation. DLEP router allocates VLAN-ID
   corresponding to every neighbor.

   For 802.1Q Tag encapsulation, neighbor's assigned VLAN-ID is set in
   the [802.1Q] TAG's C-TAG VID.

   For 802.1AD Tag encapsulation, neighbor's assigned VLAN-ID is set in
   the [802.1AD] TAG's S-TAG VID.

   For 802.1AH Tag encapsulation, neighbor's assigned VLAN-ID is set in
   the [802.1AH] TAG's B-TAG VID.

Internet-Draft          VLAN Extension to DLEP               March 2016


   This document describes the encapsulation only for the data traffic
   between DLEP peers.

5. Operation

   DLEP peers supporting this method of encapsulation MUST include a
   DLEP 'Extensions Supported' data item, including the value TBD
   representing this extension in the appropriate DLEP Session
   Initialization and Session Initialization Response messages.

   DLEP router allocates VLAN-ID corresponding to every neighbor. As
   part of "DLEP Destination UP Response" message, the router will use
   the "VLAN-ID Data Item" to assign VLAN-ID to the individual DLEP
   neighbor. Refer section 5.1 for details.

   Both modem and router tag the data traffic destined to or coming
   from a neighbor with the VLAN-ID assigned to that neighbor.

5.1. Data Item Definitions

                 Figure 1 Assignment of VLAN to neighbors


   Data Item Type: TBD
   Length: 4
   VLAN-ID: The "Vlan-ID" allocated to DLEP neighbor

   The "VLAN-ID" data item is sent from a DLEP router to the peer as
   part of "DLEP Destination Up Response" message.

6. USE Cases

   1. 802.1Q Tag (VLAN Tag): When data traffic destined to a neighbor or
     coming from a neighbor is not VLAN tagged, DLEP peers tag it with
     802.1Q TAG, with VLAN-ID field set to the VLAN-ID assigned to that
     neighbor.

   2. 802.1AD Tag (VLAN-in-VLAN Tag): When data traffic destined to a
     neighbor or coming from a neighbor is VLAN tagged (802.1Q tag),
     DLEP peers tag it with 802.1AD TAG, with VLAN-ID field in S-TAG to
     the VLAN-ID assigned to that neighbor.
   3. 802.1AH Tag (VLAN-in-VLAN-in-VLAN Tag): When data traffic destined
     to a neighbor or coming from a neighbor is VLAN-in-VLAN tagged
     (802.1AD tag), DLEP peers tag it with 802.1AH TAG, with VLAN-ID
     field in B-TAG to the VLAN-ID assigned to that neighbor.

7. Security Considerations

   As an extension to the core DLEP protocol, the security
   considerations of that protocol apply to this extension. This
   extension adds no additional security mechanisms or features.

8. IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests to IANA.

8.1. Registrations

   This specification defines new data items for DLEP. Assignments from
   the DLEP data item registry is requested for:

   1. VLAN-ID
