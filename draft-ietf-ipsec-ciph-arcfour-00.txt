     1. Introduction

     This draft describes the use of the ARCFOUR stream algorithm to
     provide confidentiality in conjunction with the IPsec ESP protocol
     [ESP].

     This document assumes readers with the terms and concepts in [RFC-
     1825] and in [ESP].  This document follows the IPsec document
     framework described in [Framework].

     ARCFOUR is described in detail in [Kaukonen].

     Internet Draft   The ESP ARCFOUR Algorithm         June 1997


     1.1 Specification of Requirements
     Interpret the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD",
     "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" that appear in this document as described
     in [RFC-2119].

     2. Cipher Algorithm

     The cipher algorithm specified in this document is the ARCFOUR
     stream cipher.

     Hardware implementations of this algorithm are expected to perform
     in the 5-20 megabyte per second range.

     3. Cipher Key Specifications

     The keys used with this cipher for ESP SHOULD be either 40 or 128
     bits.  All implementations must support 40 bit keys. All
     implementations SHOULD support 128 bit keys.  The use of 40 bit
     keys SHOULD be limited due to known attacks against this algorithm
     with that key length.

     The keying material passed from key management MUST be either 40
     bits or 128 bits of key, passed as 5 or 16 bytes.

     4. ESP Payload

     The ESP packet payload contains only the actual payload data.  No
     IV is required for this cipher.

     5. Security Considerations

     40 bit keys for ARCFOUR have been shown to be breakable.  128 bit
     keys should be used.  40 bit keys should only be used for
     exportable demonstration implementations.

     As with any other encryption technology, one should examine the
     current literature for any new attack strategies discovered after
     this document was published.

     6. Acknowledements

     An earlier draft discussing the use of this cipher was published in
     1996 by Caronni and Waldvogel, "The ESP Stream Transform", draft-
     caronni-esp-stream-01.txt, September, 1996.

     The ARCFOUR algorithm is described in [Schneier] and in the
     Internet Draft draft-ietf-cipher-arcfour-00.txt soon to be
     submitted by Kaukonen and Thayer.
