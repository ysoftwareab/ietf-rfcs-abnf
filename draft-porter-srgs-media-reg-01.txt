Abstract

   This document defines the 'application/srgs' media type
   for the augmented BNF version of the Speech Recognition Grammar
   Specification.
   
1. Introduction

   Speech Recognition Grammar Specification is an augmented BNF based language 
   which defines syntax for representating grammars for use in speech recognition 
   so that developers can specify the words and patterns of words to be listened
   for by a speech recognizer. The syntax of the grammar format is presented in 
   two forms, an augmented BNF syntax and an XML syntax.  Only the ABNF syntax is
   discussed here.  

   While not an XML syntax itself, the ABNF syntax of the Speech
   Recognition Grammar Specification uses the same character set, 
   encoding, and security considerations already established for XML.

   Feedback or discussion about this draft should be directed to the
   Voice Browser Working Group public mailing list, www-voice@w3.org
   with archives at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-voice/.


2. Registration of MIME media type application/srgs

   MIME media type name:      application
   MIME subtype name:         srgs
   Required parameters:       none
   Optional parameters:

     charset       
       Except for the different syntactic representation, the ABNF grammar 
       format follows the character encoding behavior in XML which is
       is specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME].  ABNF grammar processor must 
       accept both the UTF-8 and UTF-16  encodings of ISO/IEC 10646.  The 
       ABNF byte order mark follows the XML definition and requirements. 
       For example, documents encoded in UTF-16 must begin with the byte 
       order mark. 

       The character encoding is part of the self-identifying grammar header.
       The following is an example of an ABNF self-identifying grammar header
       for SRGS with the an optional character encoding.

                #ABNF 1.0 ISO-8859-1;

      
  Encoding considerations:
     See Section 4 of this document.

  Security considerations:
     See Section 7 of this document.

  Interoperability considerations:
     SRGS v1.0 [SRGS1] specifies user agent conformance rules that
     dictate behaviour that must be followed when dealing with, among
     other things, unrecognized elements.

  Published specification:
     See [SRGS1].

  Applications which use this media type:
     Content authors and developers have already begun hand and tool
     authoring on the Web with the ABNF form of the Speech Recognition 
     Grammar Specification v1.0.  

     
  Additional information:

     Magic number:
       The first character of an ABNF document version of SRGS following 
       must be the "#" symbol. It must be followed immediately
       by the exact string "ABNF". Next follows a single space character.  
       These characters must be encoded using the appropriate document 
       encoding as specified by the XML byte-order mark.

     File extension: .gram

     Macintosh File Type code: TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller:
     The SRGS v1.0 specification is a work product of the World
     Wide Web Consortium's Voice Browser Working Group.  The W3C has change
     control over this specification.

3. Fragment identifiers

   For documents labeled as 'application/srgs', the fragment
   identifier notation is exactly that for application/xml, as
   specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME].

4. Encoding considerations

   The considerations as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] also 
   hold for 'application/srgs'. 


5. Recognizing ABNF Speech Recognition Grammar Specification

   All ABNF SRGS files must begin with the characters "#ABNF "
   encoded in the appropriate document encoding as specified by
   the preceding optional XML byte-order mark.

6. Charset default rules

   The considerations as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] also 
   hold for 'application/srgs'. 

7. Security considerations

   The considerations as specified in RFC 3023 [XMLMIME] also
   hold for 'application/srgs'.
