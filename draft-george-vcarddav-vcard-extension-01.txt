Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2009


1.  Introduction

   As social networking has become common, it has become clear that
   users would like to include information in their vCards
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] about their social networks.  Well
   organized social network information allows the vCard owner to share
   his profile information and to import or subscribe to profile
   information of others on joining a new network.

   Data portability is an important design point in the development of
   this format.


2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


3.  Social Network Properties

   These properties are related to sharing social-network information.

3.1.  Property: OpenID

   Purpose:  OpenID is an open, decentralized user identification
       standard, allowing users to log onto many services with the same
       digital identity.  Inclusion of an OpenID URI in a vCard lets
       others add the vCard owner's ID to their authorization lists.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   ABNF:
       OPENID-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       OPENID-value =  uri

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2009


   Example:

     OpenID:http://www.alice.openid.example.org


3.2.  Property: accountServiceHomepage

   Purpose:  Designates the home page of the service provider for this
       online account.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   ABNF:
       ACCOUNTSERVICEHOMEPAGE-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param /
               pref-param / any-param
       ACCOUNTSERVICEHOMEPAGE-value =  uri

   Example:

     accountServiceHomepage:http://www.home.socialnetwork.example.org


3.3.  Property: socialProfile

   Purpose:  Designates the vCard owner's profile page on a particular
       social network.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   Special note:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the name of the social network that it refers to.
       Usually, that will also be discernible from the URI, which is why
       it's optional.  But it can be helpful to have it specified
       explicitly.

   ABNF:
       SOCIALPROFILE-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       SOCIALPROFILE-value =  uri

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2009


   Examples:

     socialProfile;type=linkedin:http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryleiba

     socialProfile;type=facebook:http://www.facebook.com/barackobama


3.4.  Property: photoAlbum

   Purpose:  Designates an online "photo album".

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   Special note:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the name of the photo album service that it refers to.
       Usually, that will also be discernible from the URI, which is why
       it's optional.  But it can be helpful to have it specified
       explicitly.

   ABNF:
       PHOTOALBUM-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       PHOTOALBUM-value =  uri

   Example:

     photoAlbum;type=flickr:http://www.flickr.com/photos/barryleiba/


3.5.  Property: depiction

   Purpose:  A depiction of something.

   Value type:  A single value.  The default is binary value.  It can
       also be reset to uri value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   Special notes:  A common use of depiction (and depicts) is to
       indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people
       or objects represented in an online photo gallery.

       The basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal
       with multimedia content (video clips, audio),

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2009


   Example:

     depiction;value=uri:http://www.example.com/pub/photos/jqpublic.gif


3.6.  Property: socialCode

   Purpose:  Description of the vCard owner, in the form of a "social
       code", such as the "geek code" (see
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_code).  Social codes are
       popularly used to exchange a large amount of social information
       in a compact way, and provide a somewhat frivolous and willfully
       obscure "fun" mechanism for characterizing technical expertise,
       interests, and habits.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   Special notes:  This property MUST include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of social network code being used.  There are no
       predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users.

       If the code contains characters that have to be quoted, such as
       COLON, SEMICOLON, or COMMA, remember to enclose the value in
       quotes.

   ABNF:
       SOCIALCODE-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       SOCIALCODE-value =  text

   Example:

     socialCode;type=geek:"s: a--"

           [Which means "I'm average size, and my age is 20-24."]


3.7.  Property: interest

   Purpose:  Lists the vCard owner's interests (social, recreational,
       technical, etc.).  This allows users to identify others with
       common interests.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2009


   Value type:  One or more text values separated by a COMMA character
       (ASCII decimal 44).

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   ABNF:
       INTEREST-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       INTEREST-value =  text

   Example:

     interest:Internet standards

     interest:New business proposals, Consulting, Job offers


3.8.  Property: topicInterest

   Purpose:  A thing of interest to this person.

   Value type:  One or more text values separated by a COMMA character
       (ASCII decimal 44).

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   Special note:  The purpose is to link a person to some thing that is
       a topic of their interests (rather than, per interest to a page
       that is about such a topic).

   ABNF:
       TOPICINTEREST-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       TOPICINTEREST-value =  text

   Example:

     topicInterest:Reading SciFi, Writing travel blogs


3.9.  Property: XX

   Template for adding another property.  Remove this paragraph.  (This
   will also hold some references for the time being: [RFC2425]
   [RFC2426] [RFC2739] [RFC4770] )

   Purpose:  Purpose here.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  (0,n)

   Special note:  Remove this section if there are no notes.

   ABNF:
       XX-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       XX-value =  text

   Example:

     xx:zz
