  Abstract

  Online Social Networking (OSN) applications have attracted millions
  of people over the last few years. Their traffic represents a large
  part of the traffic of the Internet. For instance, Facebook
  represents near 25 percent of the Internet traffic [14][15], and a
  part of this traffic is exchanged amongst groups of end-users which
  are located in the same geographic area. In this document, we
  introduce a Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture to improve the
  delivery of OSNs contents requested by end-users in the
  neighbourhood of the publishers: Having the knowledge of the social
  network graph and the end-users network location, a SDN-based NDN
  controller dynamically configures the NDN routers to route the
  interest requests directly between the end-users.

    1. Introduction

  Internet usage has rapidly evolved over the last decade, moving
  beyond simple one-to-one connections toward more complex
  interconnections between hosts.  Online Social Networking (OSN)
  services are distributed platforms through which people sharing the
  same interests, activities, background and so on can interact.  The
  most prominent OSNs are Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn [1].

  Analysing the OSN end-users behaviour is done by several research
  teams, wishing to better understand the social relationships between
  users, their habits, their way of using and consuming OSNs, etc.
  From those papers, such as [2][3][4], we can say that locality plays
  an important role in OSN applications. People are very frequently
  connected to other people that are in the same town, same region, in
  short in a close vicinity (e.g. tweets are distributed locally to
  local followers, users often send their tweets from the same
  location, etc.), except for very popular accounts (e.g. a Twitter
  account having millions of followers). However, the current
  networking behaviour of the OSN applications does not take this into
  account.   Messages are always transferred toward remote centralised
  servers, while the real destinations of the messages can be very
  close[3].

  We then defined a framework of NDN for OSN Delivery (NOD), which is
  an name-based forwarding scheme designed to optimize the delivery of
  OSN data, based on the social relationships. Our NOD framework
  focuses on four key features:

    Internet-Draft       NDN for OSN Delivery (NoD)           March 2015


  - The separation of the NDN control plane from forwarding plane

  - A centralized NDN controller and view of the network topology

  - Interface between the NDN controller and the OSN server to share
     social network graph information

  - Interface between the NDN controller and the NDN routers to
     dynamically configure the forwarding plane.

  This migration of control, formerly tightly bound in individual
  network devices, enables the underlying infrastructure to be
  abstracted for applications and network services, which can treat
  the network as a logical or virtual entity.

  The centralized view and the separation of the control plane and the
  data plane mean that the controller can create and maintain a
  topology of how the forwarding nodes under his control are connected
  and, based on some combination algorithms, can create paths through
  the network. That allows the controller to better manage traffic
  flows across the entire network and to react to changes quicker and
  more intelligently.

  The examples given in the draft configure the forwarding plane using
  SDN interfaces to highlight how Information-Centric Networking (ICN)
  concepts can help to deliver OSN contents more efficiently. These
  interfaces and underlying networking data transport could be done
  using other content naming schemes or routing protocols.

    2.  Analysis of OSN Networking Behaviour

  OSN applications work on graph structures that define the social
  relationships between end-users. The study [4] of the graph of the
  user communities of Twitter and Facebook shows that they are very
  similar:

     .  A majority of users have friends in the immediate vicinity
       (city, district or country).
     .  Only very popular users have "friends" (or followers)
       distributed almost everywhere around the world.

  The delivery of contents amongst OSN users can then be categorized
  into two groups:

  a) OSN users having a mainly local (e.g., national) follower group,
     their content is consumed locally



    P. Truong            Expires: 04 September, 2015            [Page 4]

    Internet-Draft       NDN for OSN Delivery (NoD)           March 2015


  b) OSN users having non-local (i.e., international) follower group,
     their content is consumed worldwide.

  The study of OSN network traffic shows that the flows do not reflect
  the end-users graphs. OSN applications currently forward end-users'
  requests toward either the OSN remote servers or some CDN caches
  irrespectively of the end-users' relationships. For example, the
  exchange of OSN content between two users, who are friends on the
  OSN and located in the same access ISP network, is directed outside
  the ISP network toward the OSN servers.

  The delivery of OSN content locally represents an important field of
  resources saving (transit cost, quality of experience, ...).

  Our study proposes a new architectural solution for optimizing
  content delivery in OSNs. It is based on a routing scheme that takes
  into account end-users' co-locality.

  This draft proposes a network model based on Named Data Networking
  (NDN) and the knowledge about the co-locality of end-users:  The NDN
  controller configures NDN routing states in the network based on its
  knowledge about the locations of NDN forwarding nodes and OSN
  content, as well as the social graph from the OSN.



    3. NDN-based Naming Scheme

  While our approach leverages name-based routing principles, it does
  not depend on a particular naming scheme. We propose to adopt a
  hierarchical naming scheme allowing addressing OSN applications,
  end-users of a specific OSN and the contents produced by end-users.
  As an example, for a particular OSN application the following
  hierarchical naming scheme is proposed:

  /OSNapp/UserID/contentID

  The name prefix /OSNapp denotes a specific OSN application. Then,
  the prefix /OSNapp/UserID identifies an end-user in this OSN
  "OSNapp". Finally, /OSNapp/UserID/contentID refers to a content
  produced by the end-user "UserID" of the OSN "OSNapp".

    4. Locality-aware Name-based Routing

  Based on the analysis of the OSN networking behaviour and the end-
  users behavior as described in Section 2, we propose a centralised
  controller-based NDN forwarding scheme that differentiates end-users
  based on their OSN graph, in particular on the properties of the
  list of followers of an OSN user.

  Popular end-users, whose content is consumed worldwide, should have
  a different way of working than non-popular local end-users, whose
  content will be locally consumed. For popular end-users the current
  networking behaviour of OSNs (e.g.; requests toward the centralized
  server and data given back by the server) can be retained. It
  enables OSN providers to keep knowledge of their clients and
  possibly adapt some processing for very popular end-users.
  Furthermore, it can be an added value for them (and something they
  can monetize) for popularity measurements, targeted advertisement
  (e.g. announcement of a live of a popular singer that is followed by
  millions of people, etc.).

  For local end-users, i.e. for users that have mainly friends in the
  immediate vicinity, we adopt a modified architecture to alleviate
  the load on the OSN server and to reduce the network load between
  the users' access networks and the OSN server, as according to our
  research the majority of the traffic stays locally. As such, we
  suggest to route interest requests for local content toward the
  local end-users themselves who will provide the content.

  To make local routing possible, we first define the notion of
  locality between OSN end-users by using the network routing hop. We
  say that two users are local if there are separated by two routing
  hops (or any other value depending on the design configuration).

  We assume now that all end-users (local end-users but also non-local
  ones and popular ones) can announce their prefix name in the
  network.

  Following the hierarchical naming approach described in the previous
  section, locality-aware name-based routing is possible since NDN
  allows for the routing of interests based on the longest-prefix
  matching on the name. Indeed, let us suppose that locality is
  defined by 2 routing hops, and that the user Bob requests an
  Interest for Alice's content who name is "/OSNapp/Alice/content245".
  We then have the two following possible situations:





    P. Truong            Expires: 04 September, 2015            [Page 6]

    Internet-Draft       NDN for OSN Delivery (NoD)           March 2015


     .  If Bob is located more than 2 routing hops far from Alice, his
       Interest will be routed toward the OSN server based on the OSN
       application name prefix "/OSNapp". (Note that this forwarding
       process toward the OSN server is also very likely to be applied
       to popular end-users who have friends/followers located in
       numerous places around the world.)
     .  On the opposite side, if Bob is located within the network
       region delimited by 2 routing hops, his Interest will be
       directly routed toward Alice using the name prefix
       "/OSNapp/Alice". Alice is then required to serve Bob's Interest
       by send the requested content in a Data message to Bob

  As we can see, in addition to have the route for the prefix
  "/OSNapp", we should then have different entries "/OSNapp/UserID"
  (for locally serving content requests) in the Forwarding Information
  Base (FIB) of the NDN routers. So in order to avoid a scalability
  issue when storing those routes for local users in the FIBs, we
  advocate the use of a logically-centralized NDN controller to
  dynamically configure the routes toward end-users taking into
  account information from their OSN application social graph
  required, as described in the following section.



    5. SDN-based routing configuration employing OSN information

  We advocate for a dynamic and temporary configuration of the FIB
  tables with the help of the NDN controller because is not realistic
  to think that every forwarding node will keep knowledge of all end-
  users in their FIB table for scalability reasons.

  For ensuring better scalability in the control plane with user's
  prefix announcements, we adopt a dynamical approach, based a
  Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-like architecture between a
  centralized controller and the NDN routers, which allows to
  dynamically configure the NDN forwarding tables for applying our
  local routing scheme, based on the social interactions in the OSN
  (e.g. add route in the local NDN routers according to the network
  operator's requirements and policies for a certain network region
  and/or a particular group of contents/users). In a general context
  of the workflow, when the controller receives an update message from
  the OSN server containing information about OSN contents or users'
  locations, it can decide to re-calculate routes using topological
  and OSN social graph information. If a newly calculated route
  requires modifications to one or more NDN forwarding elements, the

    Internet-Draft       NDN for OSN Delivery (NoD)           March 2015


  controller communicates the changes to the registered NDN forwarding
  nodes, respectively.

  A threshold value can be defined for each local user to estimate his
  popularity which takes into account the number of followers in an
  OSN application.

  If the user's number of followers exceeds the predefined threshold
  value, the OSN application can instruct the NDN controller to modify
  the FIBs of forwarding nodes located in close vicinity to the user
  location as discussed above by adding new prefixes and targets.

  On the other hand, if the number of followers of the local user is
  below a predefined threshold, the OSN application can instruct the
  NDN controller to modify the FIBs of the previously selected
  forwarding nodes to remove the additional FIB entries for the
  particular local user.

  This helps scaling the name-based routing approach by avoiding the
  accumulation of unnecessary FIB entries in the forwarding nodes.

  We describe in the following the main types of notification which
  can be sent to our NDN controller.

    5.1. Notification to the controller for setting routes to the OSN
  server

  At the startup, the OSN provider is responsible for announcing its
  name prefix '/OSNapp' in the network: this allows to set up routes
  in the network toward the OSN server. The announcement can be
  registered by a service running on the NDN controller to calculate
  routes for interest requests in the network to the OSN application
  server.

  Subsequently the controller populates the Forwarding Information
  base (FIB) of the registered NDN forwarding nodes. The FIB of each
  forwarding node will then contain at least one entry matching
  '/OSNapp' to forward all requests for OSNapp content to the
  respective application server if no other FIB entry has a longer
  prefix match. It is presumed that the OSN application servers are
  stable and always on so that there will no requirements for frequent
  updates of this particular FIB entry.

    5.2. Notification to the controller for OSN users' location

  When an user, let us say Joe, is getting online, the OSN server
  notifies the controller that Joe is now available. In the
  notification message, the OSN server provides the controller with
  information about Joe, such as:

     .  the location of the NDN router to which Joe is connected
     .  the list of Joe's friends/followers who are currently online,
       along with their location (i.e. the location of the NDN routers
       to which Joe's online friends are connected)
     .  the list of users Joe follows (friendship in OSNs is not
       necessarily two-way, reciprocal.)
     .  additionally, some other optional meta-information, which can
       be especially useful when Joe defines different access rights
       to his contents for his friends. For example, Joe can restrict
       the access to his personal photos to only his family members.

  Based on those elements from the OSN server and on its knowledge of
  the network topology and policies, the controller can configure the
  network with new routes toward Joe, by adding the entry
  "/OSNapp/Joe" into the FIB of the NDN nodes that are located within
  the local network region around Joe (i.e. located at most 2 routing
  hops far from the Joe, supposing that we have set the locality value
  to 2 - the value depends on network topology and configuration).
  Note that this route is added to a local NDN router only if it is
  the access router of Joe or there are Joe's online friends attached
  to the router.

  After the controller has configured the local NDN forwarding nodes
  for Joe's reachability, local friends can retrieve Joe's contents
  from himself: all related content requests will thus forwarding to
  Joe who is responsible for serving the demand.

  Now, when Joe is disconnecting, the OSN server notifies the
  controller again, which in turn can check the list of Joe's
  followers to evaluate with the help of a pre-defined threshold value
  if the number of followers of Joe still exceeds the threshold or if
  the FIB of a NDN forwarding node can be cleaned from the entries
  corresponding to "/OSNapp/Joe" name prefix. And also in the reverse
  operation, the controller can check the list of users that Joe
  himself follows in order to check if it can remove other FIB entries
  to those users to improve scalability of the approach.

    6. Application Call Flows

  This section describes in details the call flows for our local-aware
  NDN-based architecture with dynamic routing configuration.

  Let us consider the network configuration as illustrated by Figure
  1. We represent the different NDN routers in the Figure by their FIB
  (F1, F2, etc). All NDN routers have been registered with the
  controller. Therefore, as described in Section 5.1, all the FIBs,
  F1, F2,...,F6 in the Figure, contain, as a minimum, the entry
  "/OSNapp" for the route to the OSN server.

    6.1. Publication of Tweets

  For local-aware routing, we set the locality as network regions
  delimited by two routing hops. As a consequence, Alice, Joe, Walter
  are local users, i.e. located in the same local area.

  1. Joe is getting online: he connects to the OSN server using an
     application client on his smartphone or computer.
  2. The OSN server registers Joe's client and evaluates the number of
     Joe's followers
  3. In case the number of followers exceeds a predefined threshold
     value, the OSN server can decide to inform the NDN controller with
     a notification message containing meta information related to Joe
  4. The NDN controller configures the local NDN routers (located at
     most two routing hops from Joe) by adding the route "/OSNapp/Joe"
     for Joe's reachability in the related FIBs (F1 and F2 in Figure
     1). (Note that in Figure 1, we suppose Alice and Walter follow
     Joe. However, if Alice does not follow Joe, and there are no other
     users following Joe under the same router, the controller does not
     add the route "/OSNapp/Joe" to the FIB.)
  5. The NDN router FIBs F1 and F2 contain now an entry "/OSNapp/Joe"
     for the route to Joe's device.
  6. Joe can now publish his new content: the content object is stored
     in the OSN server.

    6.2. Retrieval of Tweets for Local Users

  We keep the same network configuration as in 6.1 (Figure 1). As we
  set locality to two routing hops, Alice and Walter are local users
  compared to Joe's location. They are located in the same local
  network region. Alice and Walter can then benefits from local-aware
  routing.

  1. Alice wants to retrieve Joe's content. She then expresses an
     Interest for "/OSNapp/Joe/Video10".
  2. Thanks to the previous routing configuration by the controller,
     (the router FIBs F1 and F2 in Figure 1 contain a route for
     "/OSNapp/Joe"), the network knows how to forward the
     Interest("/OSNapp/Joe/Video10"), which will finally directed to
     Joe.
  3. Joe, receiving the Interest, returns a Data message for serving
     the requested content /OSNapp/Joe/Video10.
  4. While forwarding the Data message on the reverse path (taken by
     the Interest), Joe's content is also cached in the Content Store
     of the traversed routers.
  5. Alice can then enjoy Joe's content.

    Internet-Draft       NDN for OSN Delivery (NoD)           March 2015


  6. Now, when Walter requests Joe's content /OSNapp/Joe/Video10, he
     will get it directly from the cache of his NDN access router.

    6.3. Retrieval of Tweets for Non-Local Users

  Now, we suppose that Bob wants to retrieve Joe's content Video10
  (Figure 1). In this case, as Bob is a non-local user, i.e. located
  too far from Joe, his Interest for "/OSNapp/Joe/Video10" will be
  forwarded using the prefix "/OSNapp". The OSN server is then
  responsible for serving the request, and the sent content will be
  cached in the content store of the different traversed NDN routers
  on the reverse path.
