1.  Introduction

   In Information Centric Networking (ICN)[RFC7927], the name resolution
   is defined as the first step of ICN routing along with content
   discovery and delivery, which translates a content name to locator(s)
   of providers/sources that can provide the content.  However, the name
   resolution step can be omitted in the hierarchical name based
   routing.

   NDN [NDN] and CCN [CCN] are representative projects of ICN which use
   the hierarchical name based routing.  Nevertheless, in [Afanasyev],
   in order to address the routing scalability problem in NDN's DFZ, a
   distributed mapping system called NDNS was designed, which maintains
   and lookups the mapping information from a name to its globally
   routed prefixes.  Here, NDNS is a kind of Name Resolution Service
   (NRS) in NDN.

   Similarly, CCN also has a challlenge to address the routing
   scalability problem in CCN's DFZ even though CCN uses the
   hierarchical name based routing.  Thus, NRS can be utilized in CCN
   for the scalable name based routing as well as the efficient mobility
   support.

   This document presents the design of NRS-Mapping System (NRS-MS)
   which is a system that provides the name resolution service in CCN
   and its implementation by extending CCNx.  It also describes TLV-

   based CCNx messages for NRS and modification of CCNx forwarder where
   the messages for NRS are working.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology of [CCNxSemantics] and
   [CCNxMessages] for CCNx entities.

   The following terms are used in this document and defined as follows:

   o  Mapping Server (MS) : stores and maintains the actual mapping
      table which keeps the bindings of name to some information that is
      used for forwarding Interest.  MS is a role of NRS resolver and
      all NRS messages are processed though the MS.  In other words, CCN
      nodes such as consumer, provider communicate with only MS to get
      the name resolution service.  Thus we design the MS using C CN
      protocol assuming that the NRS is served at the content router
      (CR) and each CR knows its default MS.

   o  Name List Server (NLS) : is constructed by the DNS-like tree
      according to the name hierarchy.  NLS is only used to find the
      corresponding MS which stores the binding information of the
      requested name since CR sends the NRS lookup request to its
      default MS whether it has the binding information of the requested
      name or not.  MS is located at the second level NLS and we have
      utilized the IP for the communications between MSs and NLSs.

3.  Mappig System for Name Resolution Service in CCN

   This document presents the new implementation of NRS-MS functions
   based on extension of CCNx to show usefulness of NRS in CCN.  We
   design a simple scenario to maximize NRS usefulness and to understand
   NRS functionalities easily.

   o  Scenario : Similar with CDN approach, multiple media servers
      containing popular contents can be deployed in different areas,
      but all of media data in replica servers (RSs) must have
      equivalent name to keep data integrity as one publisher's
      authority.  In order to take an advantage from the replica
      servers, NRS can be utilized to lookup the physical locations of
      the rplica servers.  The nearest replica server can be chosen from
      the information resolved by NRS.

   o  Design choices : We design and implement a new entity named a
      Mapping Server (MS) by extension of content router (CR).  The MS
      can be deployed by single network provider.  Moreover, we assume
      that an ICN edge domain is required to have at least one MS.  MS
      maintains mapping information between name and another name and
      processes a lookup request and its response.  Consumer is not
      changed.  The first hop content router (CR1) like a first hop
      router should have a communication channel toward a mapping
      server.  We design new messages to implement NRS functionalities
      just by following the CCNx messages in TLV format [CCNxMessages]
      by extension of optional fields.

4.  CCNx Extension for Name Resolution

   We have implemented the NRS for CCN based on CCNx.  This means that
   the name is resolved by Interest and Content Object packets defined
   in CCNx.  We define two types of Interest packets for NRS: Interest
   for registration (I-reg) and Interest for lookup (I-get) which are
   sent from a proper CR to its default MS for name registration and
   lookup, respectively.  We also define two types of Content Object
   (CO) packets: CO-reg and CO-get which are corresponding to the I-reg
   and I-get, respectively.  We have utilized the nested header format
   used in CCNx [CCNxMessages] to enable the newly defined packets.

4.1.  Interest

   I-get is an Interest packet requesting the name resolution.  It has
   the name of MS first where it needs to be sent.
