Abstract


    RFC 2608, RFC 2610, and RFC 2614 provide rules for configuring
    SLP agents with scopes and DAs from the protocol, DHCP, and API
    viewpoints, respectively.  The rules presented in these three
    documents, while not in conflict, are ambiguous in certain cases.
    There are also cases that fall into the cracks between the three
    documents.  For example, if the mandatory byte is off in DHCP
    for scopes and there are no statically configured scopes, but

    there are DHCP scopes, should an agent use the DHCP scopes or not?
    This document specifies a sequence of steps that interoperable
    implementations of SLP must follow in order to obtain a clear and
    unambiguous scope and DA configuration.

1.  Introduction


    The RFCs specifying the design of the Service Location Protocol
    (SLP) contain descriptions about how to configure an SLP agent with
    scopes and DAs.  These descriptions contain ambiguities and cases
    in which the procedure to follow in order to obtain a scope and DA
    configuration is inconsistent between the RFCs or missing.  This
    document clarifies the scope and DA configuration policy for SLP,
    by specifying a sequence of steps that implementations of SLP must
    follow for an interoperable configuration procedure.



2.  Terminology


    In this section, some terms used later in the document are defined
    and related to definitions in RFCs 2608 [1], 2610 [2], and 2614 [3].


       [Dynamic scope discovery] Dynamic scope discovery is equivalent to
       user scope configuration as defined in RFC 2608.  The UA performs

       active DA discovery or, if there are no DAs, active SA discovery.
       The scopes from the returned DAAdverts or SAAdverts are used.


       Dynamic DA discovery is equivalent to active DA discovery as
       defined in RFC 2608.  The agent performs active DA discovery and
       uses the returned DAs.


Dynamic DA discoveryDA scopesDA scopes are scope names obtained from
       DAAdverts returned in response to an active DA discovery, or in
       response to a unicast request for a DAAdvert.


DHCP scopes  DHCP scopes are scope names contained in DHCP Option 79.


Static config or static configuration     For scopes, these terms indicate
       the value of the net.slp.useScopes property.  For DAs, the terms
       indicate the value of the net.slp.DAAddresses property.  These
       properties are defined in RFC 2614.



3.  Ambiguities in Scope and DA Configuration


    In this section, the major ambiguities pertaining to SLP scope and DA
    configuration are discussed.



3.1.  Are Scopes Configured Through DA Scopes?


    The SLP protocol specification, RFC 2608 [1], states that UAs and
    SAs are configured with a list of scopes according to the following
    prioritized rules:


     1. The scopes are set with DHCP.


     2. The scopes are set with a static configuration file.  The
        specification also states that the static configuration may be
        explicitly set to "no scope" for UAs, if the user selectable
        scope model (i.e.  dynamic scope discovery) is desired.


     3. If there is no configuration information, the agent's scope is
        "DEFAULT".


    RFC 2608 additionally states that when dynamic scope discovery is not
    used for UAs, if a system administrator wants SAs and UAs to use a
    scope other than the default, the scopes are configured, and can be
    configured automatically by DHCP options 78 or 79 (described in RFC
    2610 [2]).


    Finally, RFC 2608 says this about DHCP configuration [1]:



Kempf,Pahmp,Holm               Expires 22 March 2000                 [Page 2]

Internet Draft       SLP and DA Scope Configuration          22 October 1999



          DHCP options 78 and 79 may be used to configure SLP. If DA
          locations are configured using DHCP, these SHOULD be used
          in preference to DAs discovered actively or passively.  One
          or more of the scopes configured using DHCP MUST be used in
          requests.  The entire configured <scope-list> MUST be used in
          registration and DA configuration messages.


    This discussion does not specify what scopes should be used if there
    is no scope configuration information from any source but there is
    DA configuration information, and the scopes of the DAs are not
    "DEFAULT".  Should the agent get its scope information from the DAs
    or not?


    This question comes up in relation to the API specification, RFC
    2614 [3], because the section on scope configuration implies that
    agents may, in fact, obtain scope configuration from configured DAs,
    rather than having the scopes configured directly.  RFC 2614 has this
    to say about scope configuration in the API library:



          Scopes configured by DHCP and scopes of DAs configured by DHCP
          have first priority (in that order) and must be returned if
          they are available.  The net.slp.useScopes property has second
          priority, and scopes discovered through the net.slp.useScopes
          property must be returned if this property is set and there are
          no scopes available from DHCP. If scopes are not available from
          either of these sources and the net.slp.DAAddresses property is
          set, then the scopes available from the configured DAs must be
          returned.


    The implication here is that scopes from DAs configured by DHCP can
    be used even if there are no scopes directly configured through DHCP,
    and similarly for statically configured scopes and DAs.



3.2.  Interpretation of the Mandatory Flag


    The DHCP configuration option specification for SLP, RFC 2610 [2],
    specifies that option 78 (DA configuration) and option 79 (scope
    configuration) have a mandatory byte.  The mandatory byte has
    different effect depending on whether it is in option 78 or option
    79.


    RFC 2610 states the following for the mandatory flag in option 78:



Kempf,Pahmp,Holm               Expires 22 March 2000                 [Page 3]

Internet Draft       SLP and DA Scope Configuration          22 October 1999



          The 'MANDATORY' flag in the Directory Agent option may be set
          to either 0 or 1.  If it is set to 1, the SLP User Agent or
          Service Agent so configured MUST NOT employ either active or
          passive multicast discovery of Directory Agents.


    This statement says nothing about what should occur if the mandatory
    flag is not set and static configuration information is present for
    DAs.  Should the UA or SA use the static configuration information
    exclusively?  Should it use the static configuration information
    and also perform dynamic DA discovery?  Should it ignore the static
    configuration information and only perform DA discovery?


    RFC 2610 states the following for the mandatory flag in option 79:



          The 'MANDATORY' byte determines whether SLP Agents override
          their static configuration for scopes with the Scope List
          string provided by the option.  This allows DHCP administrators
          to implement a policy of assigning a set of scopes to Agents
          for service provision.  If the MANDATORY byte is 0, static
          configuration takes precedence over the DHCP provided scope
          list.  If the MANDATORY byte is 1, the Scope List provided in
          this option MUST be used by the SLP Agent.


    Again, this statement is not clear about certain cases.  What happens
    if the mandatory byte is not set, and there is a list of scopes in
    option 79 but there is no static configuration information?  Should
    the agent use the DHCP-provided information, should it configure
    the scopes as "DEFAULT", or should it use scopes advertised by DAs
    discovered with dynamic DA discovery?



4.  Scope and DA Configuration Procedure


    This section specifies how an interoperable SLP agent must configure
    its scope and DA lists.  Scope configuration always preceeds DA
    configuration, unless dynamic discovery is performed.  UAs derive
    scope information from dynamically discovered DAs (or dynamically
    discovered SAs if no DAs are discovered) only if the UAs have
    not been configured with scopes.  DA and SA scopes must always be
    configured, in accordance with RFC 2608.


    When performing dynamic scope discovery, a UA first performs DA
    configuration to determine whether configured DAs are available and,
    if so, which configured DAs to use.  If DAs are configured, the UA
    contacts the DAs using unicast and uses the returned DA scopes in the

    user scoping model of RFC 2608.  If no DAs are configured, the UA
    performs active DA discovery and uses the returned scopes.  If no DAs
    are discovered from active discovery, the UA performs SA discovery
    and uses the returned scopes.  If no SAs are discovered, the UA's
    scope is DEFAULT.

5.  Resolution of Specific Ambiguities


    In this section, we discuss the resolution of ambiguities raised in
    Section 3.



5.1.  Are Scopes Configured Through DA Scopes?


    From Figure 1, the answer is that scopes are never configured
    through DA scopes, unless the agent is a UA and there are no DHCP or
    statically configured scopes.



5.2.  Interpretation of the Mandatory Flag for DHCP Option 78


    From Figure 2, if the mandatory flag is not set and static
    configuration information is present for DAs, the agent uses
    the static configuration information even if DHCP information is
    available.  This allows a system administrator or power user to
    override a global, DHCP supplied configuration on an individual host
    basis.



5.3.  Interpretation of the Mandatory Flag for DHCP Option 79


    From Figure 1, if the mandatory flag is not set and static
    configuration information is present for scopes, the agent uses the
    static configuration information even if DHCP information is present.
    As with DA configuration, this allows a system administrator or
    power user to override a global, DHCP supplied configuration on an
    individual host basis.

6.  Security Considerations


    Dynamic discovery of scopes and DAs are subject to the security
    considerations discussed in RFC 2608.  Scopes and DAs discovered with
    DHCP are subject to the security considerations associated with DHCP.
