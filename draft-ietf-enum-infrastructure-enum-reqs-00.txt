Abstract

   This document provides requirements for "infrastructure" or "carrier"
   ENUM, defined as the use of RFC 3761 technology to facilitate
   interconnection of networks for E.164 number addressed services, in
   particular but not restricted to VoIP.

Internet-Draft      Infrastructure ENUM Requirements       February 2006


   RFC2119 [1] provides the interpretations for the key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" found in this document.


1.  Infrastructure ENUM

1.1.  Definition

   Infrastructure ENUM is defined as the use of the technology in
   RFC3761 [2] by the carrier-of-record for a specific E.164 number [3]
   to map a telephone number into a URI that identifies a specific point
   of interconnection to that service provider's network that could
   enable the originating party to establish communication with the
   associated terminating party.  It is separate from any URIs that the
   end-user, who registers their E.164 number, may wish to associate
   with that E.164 number.

   In User ENUM, the entity or person having the right-to-use in a
   number has the sole discretion about the content of the associated
   domain and thus the zone content.  From a domain registration
   perspective, the end user number assignee is thus the registrant.
   Within the infrastructure ENUM namespace, we use the term "carrier of
   record" for the entity having discretion over the domain and zone
   content and acting as the registrant.  The "carrier of record" will
   typically be a service provider authorized to issue E.164 numbers for
   the provisioning of PSTN service under the authority of a National
   Regulatory Authority (NRA), but generally exhibits one or more of the
   following properties:

   o it has been assigned one or more national number ranges by an NRA.

   o it has been assigned a number range directly by the ITU, for
   instance a code under "International Networks" (+882) or "Universal
   Personal Telecommunications (UPT)" (+878).

   o it can be the recipient of a number porting operation.

   o it provides a PSTN point-of-interconnect for the number.

   It is understood that definition of carrier or record is ultimately a
   matter for national authorities to determine.

1.2.  Background

   Voice service providers use E.164 numbers currently as their main
   naming and routing vehicle. infrastructure ENUM in e164.arpa or
   another publicly available tree allows service providers to link

   Internet based resources such as URIs to E.164 numbers (Note: this is
   the other way round then User ENUM).  This allows service providers
   in addition to interconnecting via the PSTN (or exclusively) to peer
   via IP-based protocols.  Service providers may announce all E.164
   numbers or number ranges they host, regardless of whether the final
   end-user device is on the Internet, on IP-based closed NGNs or on the
   PSTN, provided an access (e.g.  SBC or gateway) to the destination
   service provider's network is available on the Internet.  There is
   also no guarantee that the originating service provider querying
   infrastructure ENUM is able to access the ingress network element of
   the destination provider's network.  Additional peering and
   accounting agreements requiring authentication may be necessary.  The
   access provided may also be to a shared network of a group of
   providers, resolving the final destination network within the shared
   network.


2.  Requirements for Infrastructure ENUM

2.1.

   Infrastructure ENUM SHALL provide a means for a provider to populate
   DNS RRs in a common publicly accessible namespace for the E.164
   numbering resources for which it is the carrier-of-record.

2.2.

   Queries of infrastructure ENUM FQDNs MUST return a result, even if
   the result is NXDOMAIN.  Queries must not be rejected, e.g. based on
   ACLs.

2.3.

   Infrastructure ENUM SHALL support RRs providing a URI that can
   identify a point of interconnection for delivery of communications
   addressed to the E.164 number.

2.4.

   Infrastructure ENUM SHALL support an IRIS capability that allows
   qualified parties to obtain information regarding the E.164 numbering
   resources and the corresponding carrier-of-record.

2.5.

   Implementation of Infrastructure ENUM MUST NOT restrict the ability
   of an end-user, in a competitive environment, to choose a Registrar
   and/or Tier 2 name server provider for end-user ENUM registrations.

2.6.

   Infrastructure ENUM SHALL be implemented under a TLD that can support
   reliability and performance suitable for PSTN applications.

2.7.

   Infrastructure ENUM MUST meet all reasonable privacy concerns about
   visibility of information an end user has no control over, for
   example discovery of unlisted numbers, or inadvertent disclosure of
   user identity.

2.8.

   Proposed implementations of Infrastructure ENUM SHOULD

   a.  Minimize changes required to existing requirements that are part
   of RFC 3761

   b.  Work with open numbering plans

   c.  Restrict additional functionality to service provider resolvers.

   d.  Minimize the number of lookups required to obtain as many NAPTR
   records (end-user and infrastructure) as possible.

   e.  Minimize the client knowledge of the numbering plan required.

   f.  Maximize synergies with end-user ENUM

   g.  Support interworking with private ENUM trees.


3.  Security Considerations

   Existing security considerations for ENUM detailed in [2] still
   apply.  Note that some registration validation issues concerning end
   user ENUM may not apply to infrastructure ENUM.  Where the Tier 1
   registry is able to identify the provider serving a number e.g.,
   based on industry data for number block assignments and number
   portability, registration might be more easily automated and a
   separate registrar not required.

   Some parties have expressed concern that an infrastructure ENUM could
   compromise end user privacy by making it possible for others to
   identify unlisted or unpublished numbers based on their registration
   in ENUM.  This can be avoided if providers register all of the their
   allocated (as opposed to assigned) numbers.  Unassigned numbers

Internet-Draft      Infrastructure ENUM Requirements       February 2006


   should be provisioned to route to the provider's network in the same
   fashion as assigned numbers and only then provide an indication that
   they are unassigned.  In that way, provider registration of a number
   in ENUM provides no more information about status of a number than
   could be obtained by dialing it.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA considerations will depend on the architecture ultimately chosen
   to meet the requirements.
