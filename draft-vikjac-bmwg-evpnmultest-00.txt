Abstract

   This document defines methodologies for benchmarking IGMP proxy
   performance over EVPN-VXLAN.  IGMP proxy over EVPN is defined in
   draft-ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy-02, and is being deployed in data
   center networks.  Specifically this document defines the
   methodologies for benchmarking IGMP proxy convergence, leave latency
   Scale,Core isolation, high availability and longevity.

   to these vlans.  The CE in turn forwards the igmp messages to leaf1
   and leaf2 operating in EVPN AA mode.  Then send traffic to these

   groups from spine1.  Traffic flows from spine1 to CE.  Send the IGMP
   leave messages for these groups in all vlans from RT connected to CE.
   Measure the time taken by the DUT to stop the traffic for these group
   flowing towards RT.

   Measurement :

   Measure the time taken by DUT to stop the multicast traffic flowing
   towards RT.

   Repeat these test and plot the data.  The test is repeated for "N"
   times and the values are collected.  The time is calculated by
   averaging the values obtained from "N" samples.

   Time taken by DUT to stop the traffic towards RT in sec =
   (T1+T2+..Tn/N)

4.  Link Flap

4.1.  To Measure the multicast packet loss in EVPN AA scenario on a CE
      link failure

   Objective:

   To measure the packet loss during the CE to DF link failure.

   Topology : Topology 1

   Procedure:


   Configure "N" evpn-vxlan in leaf1,leaf2,leaf3,spine1 and spine2.Leaf1
   and leaf2 are connected to CE which are working in EVPN AA mode.
   Configure N vlans in RT which are present in leaf1, then send igmp
   join messages from RT connected to CE for groups ranging from X1...Xn
   to these vlans.  The CE in turn forwards the igmp messages to leaf1
   and leaf2 operating in EVPN AA mode.  Then send traffic to these
   groups from spine1.  Traffic flows from spine1 to CE.  Fail the DF-CE
   link.  The NON DF now will act as DF and start forwarding the
   multicast traffic.

   Measurement :

   Measure the multicast packet loss during the link failure.Repeat the
   test "N" times and plot the data.The packet loss is calculated by
   averaging the values obtained from "N" samples.

   Packet loss in sec = (T1+T2+..Tn/N)

5.  Scale Convergence

5.1.  To measure the packet loss during the core link failure.

   Objective:

   To Measure the convergence at a higher number of vlans and igmp
   joins.

   Topology : Topology 1

   Procedure:


   Configure "N" evpn-vxlan in leaf1,leaf2,leaf3,spine1 and spine2.Leaf1
   and leaf2 are connected to CE which are working in EVPN AA mode.
   Configure N vlans in RT which are present in leaf1, then send igmp
   join messages from RT connected to CE for groups ranging from X1...Xn
   to these vlans.  The CE in turn forwards the igmp messages to leaf1
   and leaf2 operating in EVPN AA mode.  Then send traffic to these
   groups from spine1.  Traffic flows from spine1 to CE.  Fail the core
   link of DF.  The NON DF now will act as DF and start forwarding the
   multicast traffic.  The vlans and the multicast groups must be a
   higher value of N taken at random.

   Measurement :

   Measure the packet loss in seconds once the core link is
   restored.Repeat the test "N" times and plot the data.The packet loss
   is calculated by averaging the values obtained from "N" samples.

   Packet loss in sec = (T1+T2+..Tn/N)

6.  High Availability

6.1.  To Record the whether there is traffic loss due to routing engine
      failover for redundancy test.

   Objective:

   To record traffic loss during routing engine failover.

   Topology : Topology 3

   Procedure:

   Configure "N" evpn-vxlan in leaf1,leaf2,leaf3,spine1 and spine2.Leaf1
   and leaf2 are connected to CE which are working in EVPN AA mode.
   Configure N vlans in RT which are present in leaf1, then send igmp
   join messages from RT connected to CE for groups ranging from X1...Xn
   to these vlans.  The CE in turn forwards the igmp messages to leaf1
   and leaf2 operating in EVPN AA mode.  Then send traffic to these
   groups from spine1.  Traffic flows from spine1 to CE.  Then perform a
   routing engine failure.

   Measurement :

   There should be 0 traffic loss which is the ideal case, No change in
   the DF role.  DUT should not withdraw any routes.Repeat the test "N"
   times and plot the data.The packet loss is calculated by averaging
   the values obtained from "N" samples.

   Packet loss in sec = (T1+T2+..Tn/N)

7.  SOAK Test

   This is measuring the performance of DUT running with scaled
   configuration with traffic over a peroid of time "T'".  In each
   interval "t1" the parameters measured are CPU usage, memory usage,
   crashes.

7.1.  To Measure the stability of the DUT with scale and traffic.

   Objective:

   To measure the stability of the DUT in a scaled environment with
   traffic.

   Topology : Topology 3

   Procedure:


   Configure "N" evpn-vxlan in leaf1,leaf2,leaf3,spine1 and spine2.Leaf1
   and leaf2 are connected to CE which are working in EVPN AA mode.
   Configure N vlans in RT which are present in leaf1, then send igmp
   join messages from RT connected to CE for groups ranging from X1...Xn
   to these vlans.  The CE in turn forwards the igmp messages to leaf1
   and leaf2 operating in EVPN AA mode.  Then send traffic to these
   groups from spine1.  Traffic flows from spine1 to CE.

   Measurement :

   Take the hourly reading of CPU, process memory.  There should not be
   any leak, crashes, CPU spikes.
