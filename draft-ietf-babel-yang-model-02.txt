1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for the Babel routing protocol
   [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis].  The data model is defined using YANG
   1.1 [RFC7950] data modeling language and is Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NDMA) [RFC8342] compatible.  It is based on
   the Babel Information Model [I-D.ietf-babel-information-model].

1.1.  Note to RFC Editor

   Artwork in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in
   progress.  Please apply the following replacements and remove this
   note before publication.

   o  "XXXX" --> the assigned RFC value for this draft both in this
      draft and in the YANG models under the revision statement.

   o  "ZZZZ" --> the assigned RFC value for Babel Information Model
      [I-D.ietf-babel-information-model]

   o  Revision date in model, in the format 2019-07-22 needs to get
      updated with the date the draft gets approved.  The date also
      needs to get reflected on the line with <CODE BEGINS>.

1.3.  Tree Diagram Annotations

   For a reference to the annotations used in tree diagrams included in
   this draft, please see YANG Tree Diagrams [RFC8340].

2.  Babel Module

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] data model for the
   configuration and management of Babel.  The YANG module is based on
   the Babel Information Model [I-D.ietf-babel-information-model].

2.1.  Information Model

   There are a few things that should be noted between the Babel
   Information Model and this data module.  The information model
   mandates the definition of some of the attributes, e.g.  babel-
   implementation-version or the babel-self-router-id.  These attributes
   are marked a read-only objects in the information module as well as
   in this data module.  However, there is no way in the data module to
   mandate that a read-only attribute be present.  It is up to the
   implementation of this data module to make sure that the attributes
   that are marked read-only and are mandatory are indeed present.

2.2.  Tree Diagram

   The following diagram illustrates a top level hierarchy of the model.
   In addition to information like the version number implemented by
   this device, the model contains subtrees on constants, interfaces,
   routes and security.

   The interfaces subtree describes attributes such as interface object
   that is being referenced, the type of link as enumerated by Babel
   Link Properties, and whether the interface is enabled or not.

   The constants subtree describes the UDP port used for sending and
   receiving Babel messages, and the multicast group used to send and
   receive announcements on IPv6.

   The routes subtree describes objects such as the prefix for which the
   route is advertised, a reference to the neighboring route, and next-
   hop address.

   Finally, for security two subtree are defined to contain HMAC keys
   and DTLS certificates.  The hmac subtree contains keys used with the

   HMAC security mechanism.  The boolean flag babel-hmac-default-apply
   indicates whether the set of HMAC keys is automatically applied to
   new interfaces.  The dtls subtree contains certificates used with
   DTLS security mechanism.  Similar to the HMAC mechanism, the boolean
   flag babel-dtls-default-apply indicates whether the set of DTLS
   certificates is automatically applied to new interfaces.

   This module augments A YANG Data Model for Interface Management
   [RFC8343], YANG Routing Management [RFC8349], and imports definitions
   from Common YANG Data Types [RFC6991].

2.4.  Example

   The following snippet demonstrates how this data module can be
   configured.  In this example, the routing protocol being configured
   is Babel, and statistics gathering is enabled.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <routing
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-routing">
    <control-plane-protocols>
      <control-plane-protocol>
        <type
            xmlns:babel="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-babel">babel:babel
        </type>
        <name>name:babel</name>
        <babel
            xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-babel">
          <enable>true</enable>
          <stats-enable>true</stats-enable>
        </babel>
      </control-plane-protocol>
    </control-plane-protocols>
  </routing>
</config>

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URIs and one YANG module.

3.1.  URI Registrations

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-babel

3.2.  YANG Module Name Registration

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry YANG [RFC6020].

   Name:ietf-babel
   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-babel
   prefix: babel
   reference: RFC XXXX

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and
   the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM [RFC8341]) provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/created/deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default).
   These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>) to
   these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:
