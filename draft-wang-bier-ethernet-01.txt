Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any
   multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any
   explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  When a multicast
   data packet enters the BIER domain, the BFIR determines the BFERs to
   which the packet needs to be sent.  Then the BFIR encapsulates the
   packet in a BIER header and forwards the packet according to the
   BIFTs.  Currently, there is a BIER-MPLS solution to transmit
   multicast traffic using MPLS label indication.  Alternatively, this
   document tries to propose a solution named BIER Ethernet to support
   BIER forwarding in Ethernet network.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any
   multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any
   explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  A multicast data
   packet enters a BIER domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router"
   (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding
   Egress Routers" (BFERs).  The BFIR encapsulates a BIER header to the
   packet.  The BIER header contains a BitString in which each bit
   represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to.

   Specifically, after encapsulating a BIER header to the original
   multicast data packet, the BFIR and the intermediate BFRs as well as
   the BFERs require to carry out the BIER forwarding procedures to the
   BIER-encapsulated packet according to the information in the BIER
   header.  As described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture], each BFR
   firstly should determine the packet's Subdomain-ID, BitStringLength
   and Set ID information to locate the exact "Bit Index Forwading
   Table" (BIFT), and then do the subsequent procedures in terms of
   BitString and the found BIFT.

   However the existing draft requires MPLS label preceding the BIER
   header and using Bottom label to carry BIER forwarding information is
   not clean cut deign.

   Hence we should design BIER header that holds all BIER forwarding
   related information, and just let MPLS as an independent layer
   protocol to help BIER forwarding as it does for IPv4/IPv6/IPmcast
   traffic.

   Additionally, the BIER forwarding capability will be also introduced
   in enterprise/data center, such feature may be newly implemented in
   switch ASICs, with clean cut design using BIER-ethernet draft, the
   implementation will be more clean as well.

   So this document tries to propose this kind of BIER header which
   contains significant BIER information directly such as Subdomain-ID,
   BitStringLength and Set ID as well as BitString.  It is applicable
   when a given BIER domain is an Ethernet network.

     First nibble: The first 4 bits of the header are set to 0101; this
   ensures that the BIER header will not be confused with an IP header
   or with the header of a pseudowire packet.

     Ver: this 4-bit field identifies the version of the BIER header.

     Len: This 4-bit field encodes the length of BIER Ethenet header.

     Entropy: This 20-bit field specifies an "entropy" value that can be
   used for load balancing purposes.  The BIER forwarding process may do
   equal cost load balancing, but the load balancing procedure MUST
   choose the same path for any two packets have the same entropy value.

     Subdomain-ID: unique value identifying the BIER Subdomain within
   the BIER domain, as described in section 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   different BIER packets.

     BitString: together with the packet's Set ID, identifies the
   destination BFERs for this packet.

     OAM: These two bits are used for the passive performance
   measurement marking method.

     Reserved: These 10 bits are currently unused.  They SHOULD be set
   to zero upon transmission, and MUST be ignored upon reception.

     Proto:This 4-bit field identifies the type of the payload.  (The
   "payload" is the packet or frame immediately following the BIER
   header.)

     BFIR-id: By default, this is the BFR-id of the BFIR, in the
   Subdomain to which the packet has been assigned.  The BFR-id is
   encoded in the 16-bit field as an unsigned integer in the range
   [1,65535].

   Furthermore, BIER Ethernet encapsulated packet has the following
   format.  The original multicast data packet is encapsulated with two
   headers (starting from the outermost header): Outer Ethernet Header +
   BIER Ethernet Header.  Figure 2 is an example of an outer Ethernet
   Header.  The outer VLAN tag is optional.  In some situations, there
   may be some other encapsulation headers before the multicast data
   packet and after the BIER Ethernet header.

4.  Imposing and processing the BIER Ethernet header

   When a BFIR receives a multicast packet from outside the BIER domain,
   the BFIR carries out the following procedure:

   1.By consulting the "multicast flow overlay", the BFIR determines the
   set of BFERs that must receive the packet.

   2.By consulting the "BIER layer", the BFIR determines the packet's
   Subdomain, BitStringLength, Set Identifier and BitString information.
   The BFERs have the same Set Identifier can be encoded into the same
   BitString.

   3.Using information provided by the routing underlay associated with
   the packet's BIER information, the BFIR determines the next hop for
   each (Set Identifier, the BitString) combination, and copies packet
   to each Set Identifier.

   4.Before transmitting the packet to the next hop, the BFIR updates
   the BitString information and encapsulates the BIER Ethernet header
   to the multicast packet.

   When an intermediate BFR receives a BIER Ethernet encapsulated
   packet, it acquires Subdomain-ID, BitStringLength as well as Set
   Identifier information directly from the BIER Ethernet header to
   determine the BIFT, and then forwards the received BIER packet
   according to the procedures described in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   When a BFR receives a BIER Ethernet encapsulated packet whose
   Subdomain ID, Set Identifier and BitString identify the BFR itself,
   then the BFR is also a BFER for that packet.  As a BFER, it must
   decapsulate the BIER Ethernet header, and pass the original multicast
   packet out.

5.  Control Plane Considerations about BIER Ethernet

   As described in the BIER OSPF extensions
   [I-D.ietf-bier-ospf-bier-extensions] and BIER ISIS extensions
   [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions], they already define BIER Info Sub-
   TLV as the following format in Figure 3(take the ospf extensions for
   example).


      0                   1                   2                   3

                        Figure 3: BIER Info Sub-TLV

   To implement BIER Ethernet, the control plane, except the
   advertisements of BIER Info Sub-TLV, should have advertisements about
   BitStringLengths information the sending BFR supports.  A reference
   format of BSL Sub-sub-TLV is illustrated in Figure 4 (take the ospf
   extensions for example as well).

   The sending BFR may support one or several BSLs, as following:

   00000001: represents BSL 64 bits;

   00000010: represents BSL 128 bits;

   00000100: represents BSL 256 bits;

   00001000: represents BSL 512 bits;

   00010000: represents BSL 1024 bits;

   00100000: represents BSL 2048 bits;

   01000000: represents BSL 4096 bits;

   Each bit represents one BSL.  When there are two or more bits set,
   that means the sending BFR supports more than one BSL.  For example,
   if the BSL Identifier is 00010101, it means the sending BFR supports
   1024 bits, 256 bits and 64 bits.

   Additionally, the similar BSL Sub-sub-TLV extension can be introduced
   in ISIS extension and IDR extension for implementing BIER Ethernet.

6.  BIER Ethernet Considerations

6.1.  BIER Ethernet for Traffic Enginerring

   Specifically, BIER-TE encapsulation format may be the same as BIER
   encapsulation.  However,how to interpret the BitString is totally
   different.  Hence, BIER-Ethernet encapsulation MUST need one
   identifier to be assigned to identify the BIER header is for BIER
   forwarding or BIER-TE forwarding.  For example, one bit in Reserved
   field can be reserved for this purpose.

6.2.  BIER Ethernet for Multicast VPN

   In MVPN, the P-tunnels are used for carrying multicast traffic across
   backbone.  BIER tunnel Type is newly defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn].
   The BIER Encapsulation used for multicast tunnel is independant of
   the (upstream assigned) MPLS label.  Hence, BIER-Ethernet can also be
   used as P-Tunnel.  In other words, there may need a new Tunnel Type
   to identify BIER-Ethernet Tunnel type, or a new flag to distinguish
   BIER-MPLS tunnel and BIER-Ethernet Tunnel.

7.  Assignment Considerations

7.1.  IEEE Registration Authority Considerations

   This document requests the IEEE Registration Authority to assign a
   new Ethertype for BIER Ethernet Header.

7.2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires new IANA allocation for BSL Sub-sub-TLV
   extension in different routing protocol.
