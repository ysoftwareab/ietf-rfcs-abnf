		DHCP option for NSH in Service Function Path (SFP)
		  draft-ypal-sfc-dhcp-option-for-nsh-for-sfp-00

Abstract

   This draft specifies Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol option
   (both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) for NSH aware clients participating in
   the service function path(SFP) of the service chaining. As part 
   of this proposal SFF and SF will receive the SFP information 
   containing Service Path Identifier(SPI), Transport protocol and 
   Nexthop(NH) address of subsequent SFF/SF.

2. Introduction
   In NSH aware service chaining model, SFF needs to be provisioned with 
   SFP information. In the current environment, the operator 
   manually provisions each network elements(SFF) with SFP information. 
   This does not scale well when on-demand service functions are introduced
   and brought down in virtualized networks in cloud, datacenter, and so

   forth deployments. This draft is trying to automate this network rollout
   of service chaining using the DHCP option. Each SFF willing to 
   participate in NSH aware service chain model will indicate its interest 
   to the DHCP server for SFP and gets provisioned accordingly from the 
   DHCP server.

2.1. Terminology
   This document uses the terminology defined in draft-ietf-sfc-nsh with
   respect to service function chain.

   DHCP client: A DHCP [1] client is an Internet host that uses DHCP to 
   obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.

   DHCP server: A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns 
   configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

   Service Function Forwarder (SFF):  A service function forwarder is
      responsible for delivering traffic received from the SFCNF to one
      or more connected service functions, and from service functions to
      the SFC network forwarder(SFCNF).

   Service Function (SF):  A function that is responsible for specific
      treatment of received packets.  A service function can act at the
      network layer or other OSI layers.  A service function can be a
      virtual instance or be embedded in a physical network element.
      One of multiple service functions can be embedded in the same
      network element.  Multiple instances of the service function can
      be enabled in the same administrative domain.

   Service Function Path (SFP):  The instantiation of a SFC in the
      network.  Packets follow a service function path from a classifier
      through the requisite service functions.

3. Model and Applicability
   In service chaining model, SFC controller will provision SFF with
   details of service function paths SFP(s). In order to provision SFP 
   details to SFF(s), controller needs some mechanism to configure the 
   SFF. DHCP protocol is one of the existing mechanism for provisioning 
   various network information to any DHCP clients.

   Existing DHCP version 4 and 6 will be extended to incorporate option
   of provisioning dynamically SFP details to SFF. In this case,
   controller can be considered to act as DHCP server.

4.1 DHCPv4 Options

4.1.1 DHCPv4 NSH SFP Option
   The NSH SFP option can be used by the client and server during the 
   initial four message exchanges (DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST,
   and DHCPACK) or during two message exchange (DHCPINFORM and DHCPACK)
   to configure the SFP details to SFF DHCP clients (i.e SFF will 
   receive SFP details along with other DHCP configuration parameters).

   The format of NSH SFP option for DHCPv4 is:

     0                   1                   2                   3

5. Request and Processing DHCP SFP Option
   In the service chaining model, SFF DHCP clients willing to participate 
   in SFP can request SFP information from the DHCP server using the 
   OPTION_NSH_SFP option. Details of this request in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 
   are detailed in below sections.

5.1. DHCPv4 Client Behaviour
   DHCPv4 client enabled with the capability of doing SFF/SF role in SFP 
   MUST request for SFP information in DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST of
   DHCPv4 protocol exchanges. Client behaviour is detailed below.

5.1.1 Requesting OPTION_NSH_SFP
   SFF enabled DHCPv4 client interested in SFP MUST send the 
   OPTION_NSH_SFP option to the DHCPv4 server along with other 
   options in Parameter Request List (PRL).

   A client configured from beginning to act as SFF MUST include the 
   OPTION_NSH_SFP option in both DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST to inform 
   the server about the options client is interested in. Whereas, if the
   client is configured latter to act as SFF after initial exchanges, it
   MUST include OPTION_NSH_SFP option in the DHCPINFORM message to inform
   the server.

Internet-Draft         DHCP option for NSH in SFP          February 2016

5.2. DHCPv4 Server Behaviour
   A DHCPv4 server if configured to handle service chaining, SHOULD
   provision the SFF clients with SFP, as per its administrative policy. 
   A server can receive requests for OPTION_NSH_SFP option from clients 
   in different message (DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST) exchanges.

   DHCPv4 server SHOULD inform the client with the option OPTION_NSH_SFP
   and SFP information in both DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK messages as a response 
   to the DHCP client's DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST respectively. If the
   DHCPv4 server receives the option OPTION_NSH_SFP during DHCPINFORM 
   exchange, it SHOULD process and respond back as per administrative 
   policy (server MAY choose to act as per the host requirement document). 
   NSH SFP option sent to client is detailed in section 4.1.1 

5.3. DHCPv6 Client Behaviour
   DHCPv6 client enabled with capability of doing SFF/SF role in SFP can
   request for SFP information at different stages of DHCPv6 protocol 
   exchanges. Client behaviour is detailed below.

5.3.1 Requesting OPTION_NSH_SFP
   SFF enabled DHCPv6 client interested in SFP MUST send the 
   OPTION_NSH_SFP option to the DHCPv6 server along with other 
   options in Option Request Option (ORO).

   A client configured from beginning to act as SFF MUST include an 
   Option Request option in a Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Confirm 
   message to inform the server about options the client wants the server
   to send to the client. Whereas if the client is configured latter to 
   act as SFF MUST include an OPO in the Information-request 
   message to inform the server about options client wants server to send.

5.4. DHCPv6 Server Behaviour
   A DHCPv6 server if configured to handle service chaining, SHOULD 
   provision the SFF clients as per the administrative policy.
   A server can receive request for OPTION_NSH_SFP option from clients, 
   in different messages (Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Confirm or 
   Information-request).

   Whenever server detects any change is required in the SFP path, it
   will inform the clients using Reconfigure Message. 

5.4.1 Processing OPTION_NSH_SFP Request
   A server receiving the option OPTION_NSH_SFP in Solicit, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Confirm or Information-request will process this request and 
   SHOULD respond back to exchange with NSH SFP option as detailed in 
   section 4.2.1

5.4.2 Notifying update in SFP path to SFF
   Any update to notify about change in service chain path is notified 
   to SFF client using Reconfigure Message as defined in section 22.19 of
   [RFC3315].

5.5. Geolocation Based SFP 
   In certain cloud deployment scenarios, operator will like to know the
   details of SFF location to provide information to local authority towards
   integrity of resources and data moving across the SFF. In such scenarios,
   SFF sends option OPTION_NSH_SFP along with geolocation option to DHCP
   server.

   In order to achieve this, the DHCP SFF clients SHOULD include the 
   GeoConf option as per RFC6225 and OPTION_GEOCONF_CIVIC option as per 
   RFC4776 for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 respectively, along with the OPTION_NSH_SFP
   option in DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, DHCPINFORM requests of DHCPv4 and 
   in Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Confirm or Information-request in 
   DHCPv6 exchanges.

6. Security Considerations
   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and
   requesting client can discover the SFP information.

   To minimize the unintended exposure of SFP, the OPTION_NSH_SFP
   option SHOULD be returned by DHCP servers only when the DHCP client
   has included this option in its request (Section 3.5 of [RFC2131], 
   Section 9.8 of [RFC2132]).

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this option,
   DHCP authentication as defined in "Authentication for DHCP Messages"
   [RFC3118] and "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"
   [RFC3315] SHOULD be used to protect the integrity of the DHCP
   options.

   Link-layer confidentiality and integrity protection may also be
   employed to reduce the risk of location disclosure and tampering.

7. IANA Considerations
   Request to IANA for assignment of values for following.

   Table 1: Transport Types values.
   Table 2: Protocol ID values.
   Table 4: SFP-NH Type values.
   Code: OPTION_NSH_SFP for DHCPv4.
   option-code: OPTION_NSH_SFP for DHCPv6.
