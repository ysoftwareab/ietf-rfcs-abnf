1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes two new Header Extensions that may be used 
   with both Unidirectional Link Encapsulation, ULE, [RFC4236] and the 
   Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) [GSE]. ULE is defined for links 
   that employ the MPEG-2 Transport Stream, and supports a wide variety 
   of physical-layer bearers [RFC4259]. GSE has been designed for the 
   Generic Mode (also known as the Generic Stream (GS)), offered by 
   second-generation DVB physical layers, and specifically for DVB-S2 
   [ETSI-S2]. The requirements for the Generic Stream are defined in 
   [S2-REQ], [S2-REQ-RCS], and [ID-S2-REQ]. The important 
   characteristics of this encapsulation are described in an Appendix 
   to this document. GSE maintains a design philosophy that presents a 
   common network interface to that of ULE and uses a similar 
   construction for Subnetwork Data Unit (SNDUs). 
    
     
   One extension header defines a method that allows one or more TS-
   Packets [ISO-MPEG] to be sent within a ULE SNDU. This method may be 
   used to provide control plane information including the transmission 
   of MPEG-2 Program Specific Information (PSI) for the Multiplex. In 
   GSE, there is no native support for transport stream packets and 
   this method is therefore suitable for providing an MPEG-2 control 
   plane. 
    
   A second extension header allows one or more PDUs to be sent within 
   the same ULE SNDU. This method is designed for cases where a large 
   number of small PDUs are directed to the same Network Point of 
   Attachment (NPA) address. The method may improve transmission 
   efficiency (by removing duplicated MAC layer overhead). It can also 
   reduce processing overhead for receivers that are not addressed by 
   the NPA, since these receivers may then skip several PDUs in one 
   operation. The method is defined as a generic extension header and 
   may be used for IPv4 or IPv6 packets. If and when a compression 
   format is defined for ULE or Ethernet, the method may also be used 
   in combination with this method. 
    
   Future versions of this document are expected to provide 
   recommendations on the interface between the Generic Stream 
   Encapsulation (GSE) and the Internet Protocol Stack. 
    
   The appendix includes a summary of key design issues and 
   considerations based on the GSE Specification defined by the DVB 
   Technical Module[GSE].

3. Description of the Method 
    
   In ULE, a Type field value that is less than 1536 Decimal indicates 
   an Extension Header.  This section describes a set of two extension 
   formats for the ULE encapsulation. The GSE specification is defined 
   in [GSE] and follows these formats, but as in other  SNDU formats, 
   GSE does not include a per-SNDU CRC and utilises a different SNDU 
   length calculation [GSE]. 
    
    
3.1 MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension  
    
   >>> IANA Action required, please replace < #NH-TS-CAT> with assigned 
   value from the Next-Header Registry>>> 
    
   The MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension Header is specified by an IANA 
   assigned H-Type value of <#NH-TS-CAT>. This is a Mandatory Next-
   Header Extension.   
    
   The extension is used to transport 1 or more MPEG-2 TS Packets 
   within a ULE SNDU. The number of TS Packets carried in a specific 
   SNDU is determined from the size specified by the remainder of the 
   Payload following the MPEG-2 TS Extension. A Receiver MUST verify 
   that payload length is correct prior to processing it, and SHOULD be 
   recorded as TS-concat size mismatch error. 
    
   Consider the example shown in the figure below. The value D=0 
   indicates the presence of a NPA address. In this example, there are 
   no additional extension headers between the ULE base header and the 
   TS-Concast extension, therefore the payload length value using ULE 
   is (Length - 10) / 188, whereas the value for payload length using 
   GSE is (Length - 6) / 188.

   The extension may be used to transport one or more MPEG-2 TS Packets 
   of arbitrary content, interpreted according to [ISO-MPEG]. One 
   expected use is for the transmission of MPEG-2 SI/PSI signalling. 
    
   The use of this format to transfer MPEG-2 clock references (e.g. a 
   Network Clock Reference, NCR, SI Table) over ULE/GSE framing raises 
   timing considerations at the encapsulation gateway, including the 
   need to update/modify the timing information prior to transmission 
   by the physical layer. These issues are not considered here, but it 
   is noted that the operation may be simplified by ensuring that all 
   SNDUs that carry this Extension Header are placed before other data 
   within the GSE DataField [GSE].

3.2 PDU-Concat Extension 
    
   >>> IANA Action required, please replace <#NH-PDU-CAT> with assigned 
   value from the Next-Header Registry>>> 
    
   The PDU-Concat Extension is specified by an IANA assigned H-Type 
   value of #NH-PDU-CAT This is a Mandatory Next-Header Extension.  It 
   enables a sequence of (usually short) PDUs to be sent within a 
   single SNDU payload.  
    
   The base header contains the Length of the entire SNDU. This carries 
   the value of the combined length of all PDUs to be encapsulated, 
   including each set of encapsulation headers. The base header also 
   caries a 16-bit ULE Type field. Although any Type value specified in 
   the ULE Next-Header Registry may be assigned to the encapsulated 
   PDU, all PDUs included in the SNDU payload MUST have a common ULE 
   Type (i.e. all concatenated PDUs passed by the network layer must be 
   associated with the same Type value). This simplifies the receiver 
   design, and reduces the transmission overhead for common use cases.  
    
   Each PDU is prefixed by its length in bytes (shown as PDU-Length in 
   the following diagrams). Encapsulated PDUs are of arbitrary length 
   (in bytes) and are not necessarily aligned to 16-bit or 32-bit 
   boundaries within the SNDU (as shown in the figure). The most 
   significant bit of the first byte MUST be set to zero. The length of 
   each PDU MUST be less than 32 758 bytes, but will generally be much 
   smaller.  
 
   When the SNDU header indicates the presence of an SNDU Destination 
   Address field (i.e. D=0), a Network Point of Attachment, NPA, field 
   directly follows the fourth byte of the SNDU header. NPA destination 
   addresses are 6 Byte numbers, normally expressed in hexadecimal, 
   used to identify the Receiver(s) in a transmission network that 
   should process a received SNDU.  When present the Receiver MUST 
   associate the same specified MAC/NPA address with all PDUs within 
   the SNDU Payload. This MAC/NPA address MUST also be forwarded with 
   each PDU, if required by the forwarding interface.

   The Receiver processes this Extension Header by verifying that it 
   supports the specified CONCAT-PDU Type (unsupported Types MUST be 
   discarded but the receiver SHOULD record a PDU-Type error).  It then 
   extracts each encapsulated PDU in turn. The Receiver MUST verify the 
   Length of each PDU. It MUST also ensure the sum of the Lengths of 
   all processed PDUs is less than the Length specified in the SNDU 
   base header. A Receiver MUST discard the whole SNDU if the sizes do 
   not match and this event SHOULD be recorded as a PDU-concat size 
   mismatch error.

4. Summary 
    
   This document defines a set of Next_Header Extensions for the 
   Unidirectional Link Encapsulation (ULE).  
    
    
5. IANA Considerations  
    
   This document requires IANA involvement for the assignment of two 
   new Next-Header Type values from the IANA ULE Next-Header Registry. 
   These options are defined for specific use cases envisaged by GSE, 
   but are compatible with ULE.  
    
   The TS-Concat Extension is a Mandatory next-type extension header, 
   specified in section 3.1 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of #NH-TS-CAT. 
    
   The PDU-Concat Extension is a Mandatory next-type extension header 
   specified in section 3.2 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of #NH-PDU-CAT. 
    
    
6. Acknowledgments 
    
   The author gratefully acknowledges the inputs, comments and 
   assistance offered by the members of the DVB-GBS ad hoc group on S2 
   encapsulation, in particular contributions on transmission aspects 
   from Rita Rinaldo, Axel Jahn, and Ulrik De Bie. 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   No specific security issues are raised within this document. 
    
   Additional security control fields may be provided as a part of a  
   link encryption Extension Header, e.g. to associate a PFU with one 
   of a set of Security Association (SA) parameters. As a part of the 
   encryption process, it may also be desirable to authenticate 
   some/all of the headers. The method of encryption and the way in 
   which keys are exchanged is beyond the scope of this specification, 
   as also are the definition of the SA format and that of the related  
   encryption keys.

DOCUMENT HISTORY 
 
   Individual Draft 00 
 
   This draft complements a study item in the DVB-GBS in this area to 
   define a Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE).  Comments relating to 
   this document will be gratefully received by the author(s) and may 
   also be sent to ip-dvb mailing list at: ip-dvb@erg.abdn.ac.uk 
    
   Individual Draft 01 
   Co-Author Added. 
   This draft updates the language and format. 
   This draft fixes problems with the concatenation mode, and defines a 
   new header format that restricts the use of the Type field so that 
   all concatenated PDUs MUST have the same Type. 
    
   Future versions of this draft may define additional Extension 
   Headers, proposals and ideas are welcome via the IETF ipdvb mailing 
   list. Possible extensions include those for encapsulation FEC, Link 
   parameter negotiation (e.g. for header compression), and support for 
   ATM/ULE. 
    
   Working Group Draft 00 
    
   Fixed editorial mistakes from Christian Praehauser and ID style for 
   WG adoption.

APPENDIX: DVB-S.2 
    
   PDUs, (Ethernet Frames, IP datagrams or other network layer packets) 
   are encapsulated to form a Subnetwork Data Unit (SNDU) [RFC4236] 
   associated with a specific Stream at the link layer. The SNDU is 
   transmitted over an DVB-S2 link by placing it either in a single 
   BBFrame, or if required, an SNDU may be fragmented into a series of 
   BBFrames [ID-S2-REQ]. A mode also permits an SNDU to be fragmented 
   with the remaining fragments sent in a later BBFrame(s), while 
   preserving the original order of each SNDU sent to a specific 
   MAC/NPA address over a Stream. Where there is sufficient space, the 
   method permits a BBFrame to carry more than one SNDU (or part there 
   of), sometimes known as Packing. All parts comprising an SNDU are 
   assigned to the same Stream.  
 
   In ULE and MPE [ETSI-DAT], each SNDU carries a 32-bit CRC field in 
   the last four bytes of the SNDU. The purpose of this CRC is to 
   protect the SNDU (header, and payload) from undetected reassembly 
   errors and errors introduced by unexpected software / hardware 
   operation. This also serves to verify the delineation (framing) of 
   PDUs and may detect the presence of uncorrected errors from the 
   physical link 
    
   When an SNDU is sent over a DVB-S2 subnetwork using GSE, the 
   Integrity protection is provided by a CRC at the baseband frame 
   level, using a CRC in the final bytes of the DataField.
