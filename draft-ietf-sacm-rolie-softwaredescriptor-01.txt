              draft-ietf-sacm-rolie-softwaredescriptor-01

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core to add the information type category and
   related requirements needed to support Software Record and Software
   Inventory use cases.  The 'software-descriptor' information type is
   defined as a ROLIE extension.  Additional supporting requirements are
   also defined that describe the use of specific formats and link
   relations pertaining to the new information type.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) [RFC8322] protocol to
   support the publication of software descriptor information.  Software
   descriptor information is information that characterizes:

      an installable software package, or

      information about static software components that may be installed
      by a software package or patch.

   Software descriptor information includes identifying, versioning,
   software creation and publication, and file artifact information.
   Software descriptor information provides data about what might be

   installed, but doesn't describe where or how a specific software
   installation is installed, configured, or executed.

   Some possible use cases for Software descriptor information include:

   o  Software providers can publish software descriptor information so
      that software researchers and users of software can understand the
      collection of software produced by a that software provider.

   o  Organizations can aggregate and syndicate collections of software
      descriptor information provided by multiple software providers to
      support software-related analysis processes (e.g., vulnerability
      analysis) and value added information (e.g., software
      configuration checklist repositories) using identification and
      characterization information derived from software descriptor
      information.

   o  End user organizations can consume sources of software descriptor
      information, and other related software vulnerability and
      configuration information to provide the data needed to automate
      software asset, patch, and configuration management practices.

   o  Organizations can use software descriptors to support verification
      of other entities, thru mechanisms such as RIM or other integrity
      measurements.

   This document supports these use cases by describing the content
   requirements for Collections of software descriptor information that
   are to be published to or retrieved from a ROLIE repository.  This
   document also discusses requirements around the use of link
   relationships and describing the data model formats used in a ROLIE
   Entry describing a software descriptor information resource.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
   terminology used in this document can be found in Section 2 of
   [RFC5070].

3.  Additional Requirements for the Atom Publishing Protocol

   This document does not specify any additional requirements for use of
   the Atom Publishing Protocol.

4.  Additonal Requirements for the Atom Syndication Format

   This document does not specify any additional requirements on the
   Atom Syndication Format.

5.  Information-type Extensions

   This document defines the following information type[s]:

5.1.  The "software-descriptor" information type

   The "software-descriptor" information type represents any information
   that describes a piece of software.  This document uses the
   definition of software provided by [RFC4949].  Note that as per this
   definition, this information type pertains to static software, that
   is, code on the disc.  The software-descriptor information type is
   intended to provide a category for information that does one or more
   of the following:

   identifies and characterizes software  This software identification
      and characterization information can be provided by a large
      variety of data, but always describes software in a pre-installed
      state.

   provides software installer metadata  This represents information
      about software used to install other software.  This metadata
      identifies, and characterizes a software installation package or
      media.

   describes stateless installation metadata  Information that describes
      the software post-deployment, such as files that may be deployed
      during an installation.  It is expected that this metadata is
      produced generally for a given installation, and may not exactly
      match the actual installed files on a given endpoint.

   Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of information that may be
   considered to be of a software-descriptor information type.

   o  Naming information: IDs and names that aid in the identification
      of a piece of software

   o  Version and patching information: Version numbers, patch
      identifiers, or other information that

   o  Vendor and source information: Includes where the software was
      developed or distributed from, as well as where the software
      installation media may be located.

Internet-Draft                ROLIE SWD EXT                   March 2018


   o  Payload and file information: information that describes or
      enumerates the files and folders that make up the piece of
      software, and information about those files.

   o  Descriptive information and data: Any information that otherwise
      characterizes a piece of software, such as libraries, runtime
      environments, target OSes, intended purpose or audience, etc.

   Note again that this list is not exhaustive, any information that in
   is the abstract realm of an incident should be classified under this
   information-type.

   This information type does not include descriptions of running
   software, or state and configuration information that is associated
   with a software installation.

5.2.  Use of the rolie:format element

   This document does not contain any additional requirements for the
   rolie:format element, the formats that follow are provided as
   examples of formats that describe the software descriptor information
   type.

5.2.1.  The ISO SWID 2016 format

   The ISO SWID Tag 2016 format is a software descriptor and software
   record data format.  It provides several tags: primary, which
   provides descriptive and naming information about software, patch,
   which describes non-standalone software meant to patch existing
   software, and corpus, which describes the software installation media
   that installs a given piece of software.

   For a more complete overview as well as normative requirements, refer
   to :ISO/IEC 19770-2 [SWID]

5.2.2.  The Concise SWID format

   The Concise SWID (COSWID) format is an alternative representation of
   the ISO SWID Tag 2016 format using a CBOR encoding defined by a CDDL
   specification.  It provides the same features and attributes as are
   specified in ISO 19770-2, plus:

   o  a straight forward method to sign and encrypt SWID Tags using
      COSE, and

   o  additional attributes that provide an improved structure to
      include file hashes intended to be used as Reference Integrity
      Measurements (RIM).

6.  rolie:property Extensions

   This document registers new valid rolie:property names as follows:

6.1.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:id

   This property provides an exposure point for an identification field
   from the associated software descriptor.  The value of this property
   SHOULD be uniquely identifying information generated from the
   software descriptor linked to by the entry's atom:content element.
   swd:id property values SHOULD have a one-to-one mapping to individual
   pieces of SWD content.

6.2.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swname

   This property provides an exposure point for the plain text name of
   the software being described.  Due to the great variance in naming
   schemes, this property should be considered informative.

7.  atom:link Extensions

   This section defines the requirements around the implementation of
   link relationships in the atom:link element in Entries.  Each
   relationship is named, described, and given a requirement level.

8.  Other Registered Extensions

   There are no additional extensions to define.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  software-descriptor information-type

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE Security Resource Information
   Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type> .

   The entry is as follows:

      name: software-descriptor

      index: TBD

      reference: This document, Section 5.1

9.2.  swd:id property

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE URN Parameters" registry
   located in <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/>.

   The entry is as follows:

      name: property:swd:id

      Extension IRI: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:id

      Reference: This document, Section 6.1

      Subregistry: None

9.3.  swd:swname property

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE URN Parameters" registry
   located in <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/>.

   The entry is as follows:

      name: property:swd:swname

      Extension IRI: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swname

      Reference: This document, Section 6.2

      Subregistry: None

10.  Security Considerations

   Use of this extension implies dealing with the security implications
   of both ROLIE and of software descriptors in general.  As with any
   SWD information, care should be taken to verify the trustworthiness
   and veracity of the descriptor information to the fullest extent
   possible.

   Ideally, software descriptors should have been signed by the software
   manufacturer, or signed by whichever agent processed the source code.
   SWD documents from these sources are more likely to be accurate than
   those generated by scraping installed software.

   These "authoritative" sources of SWD content should consider
   additional security for their ROLIE repository beyond the typical
   recommendations, as the central importance of the repository is
   likely to make it a target.

Internet-Draft                ROLIE SWD EXT                   March 2018


   Version information is often represented differently across
   manufacturers and even across product releases.  If using SWD version
   information for low fault tolerance comparisons and searches, care
   should be taken that the correct version scheme is being utilized.

11.  Privacy Considerations

   This extension does not introduce any privacy considerations above or
   beyond that of the core ROLIE document.  Any implementations using
   this extension should understand the privacy considerations of ROLIE
   and the Atom Publishing Protocol.
