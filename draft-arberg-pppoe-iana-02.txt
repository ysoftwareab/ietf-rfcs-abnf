1. Introduction

   This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding the registration of values related to 
   the PPP over Ethernet Protocol (PPPoE), defined in [RFC2516], in
   accordance with BCP 26, [RFC2434].  It also reserves PPPoE TAG
   values as well as PPPoE packet Code fields which are or have been
   in use on the Internet.


1.1 Terminology

   The following terms are used here with the meanings defined in
   BCP 26:  "name space", "registration".

   The following policies are used here with the meanings defined in
   BCP 26: "First Come First Served".

1.2 Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. IANA Considerations

   The PPPoE protocol as defined in [RFC2516] defines two name spaces 
   that requires registration, the PPPoE TAG and the PPPoE Code field.


2.1 Registration Policies for PPPoE TAG Values

   IANA shall set up a registry of "PPPoE TAG Values". These are
   16-bit values. PPPoE TAG values already in use are specified as 
   reserved in this document, all other TAG values between 0 and 65535 
   are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" 
   policy defined in [RFC2434]. 

   A TAG-Name, and a point of contact or a specification description 
   (if any exists) MUST be provided for any assignment from this 
   registry.


2.2 Reserved PPPoE TAG Values

   TAG Value            TAG Name                         Reference

2.3 Registration Policies for PPPoE Code fields

   IANA shall set up a registry of PPPoE Active Discovery Code 
   fields. These are 8-bit values. PPPoE Code fields already in use 
   are specified as reserved in this document, all other Code values 
   between 0 and 255 are to be assigned by IANA, using the 
   "First Come First Served" policy defined in [RFC2434]. 

   A PPPoE Active Discovery packet name and a point of contact or a 
   specification description (if any exists) MUST be provided for any 
   assignment from this registry.


2.4 Reserved PPPoE Code fields

   Code Value  PPPoE Packet Name                         Reference
   ----------  ---------------------------------------   ---------
   0     0x00  PPP Session Stage                         [RFC2516]

3. Security Considerations

   This document focuses on IANA considerations for the PPPoE protocol, 
   and as such should help remove the possibility for the same PPPoE
   code field and PPPoE TAG value being used for different 
   functionalities.
