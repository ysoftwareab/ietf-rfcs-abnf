1.  Introduction

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model], the Autonomic Service
   Agent (ASA) is the atomic entity of an autonomic function, and it is
   instantiated on autonomic nodes.  When ASAs communicate with each
   other, they should use the Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol
   (GRASP) [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp].  It is essential that such
   communication is strongly secured to avoid malicious interference
   with the Autonomic Network Infrastructure (ANI).

   For this reason, GRASP must run over a secure substrate that is
   isolated from regular data plane traffic.  This substrate is known as
   the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP).  A method for constructing an ACP
   at the network layer is described in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane].  Scenarios for link layer
   ACPs are discussed in [I-D.carpenter-anima-l2acp-scenarios].  The
   present document describes a simple method of forming an ACP
   immediately above the transport layer, known as QUADS (QUick And
   Dirty Security) ACP for GRASP.

   It also describes a simplistic key infrastructure known as QUADSKI,
   using asymmetric cryptography embedded in GRASP objectives used over
   insecure instances of GRASP.

2.  QUick And Dirty Security ACP Method

   Every GRASP message, whether unicast or multicast, is encrypted
   immediately before transmission, and decrypted immediately after
   reception, using the same symmetric encryption algorithm and domain-
   wide shared keys.  This applies to all unicast and multicast messages
   sent over either UDP or TCP.  Typically encryption will take place
   immediately after a message is encoded as CBOR [RFC7049], and
   decryption will take place immediately before a message is decoded
   from CBOR.

   There is no attempt to specify an automatic algorithm choice.  Every
   instance of GRASP in a given Autonomic Network (AN) must be pre-
   configured with the choice of encryption algorithm and any necessary
   parameters, and with the same key(s).

   An alternative to configuring the keys is that every instance of
   GRASP is pre-configured with a fixed salt value and the keys are
   created from a locally chosen keying password, using a pre-defined
   hash algorithm and that salt value.  Note that the salt value cannot
   be secret as it must be the same in all QUADS for all GRASP
   implementations.  In this model the secrecy depends on the keying
   password.

   The choice of algorithms should follow best current practice, e.g.
   [RFC8221].  At present the following choices are recommended: AES/
   CBC, key length 32, initialisation vector length 16, padding
   PKCS7(128).

3.  QUick And Dirty Security Key Infrastructure

   This uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to secure delivery of QUADS
   keys from a key server in one autonomic node to another node wishing
   to join the AN domain, known as a "pledge" to align with BRSKI
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] terminology.

   A QUADSKI key server exists in one instance in a given AN.  It
   supports two GRASP objectives, provisonally named "411:quadskip" and
   "411:quadski".  It runs via an instance of GRASP that is not running
   QUADS, i.e. its traffic is not encrypted except as defined below.

   "411:quadskip" is a synchronization objective that is flooded out to
   all nodes in the AN.  Its value is the PEM encoding of the public RSA
   key of the QUADSKI server.  In fragmentary CDDL [RFC8610], it is
   defined as follows:

Internet-Draft             QUADS ACP for GRASP                 June 2020


  quadskip-objective = ["411:quadskip", objective-flags, loop-count, value]
  objective-flags = ; as in the GRASP specification
  loop-count = ; as in the GRASP specification
  value = server-PEM
  server-PEM = bytes

   The recommended frequency of flooding is once per minute with a valid
   life time of two minutes.  By this means, every autonomic node can
   learn the public key of the server.

   "411:quadski" is a negotiation objective that is used by an autonomic
   node that wishes to enrol securely in the AN, i.e. a pledge.  In
   fragmentary CDDL, it is defined as follows:

  quadski-objective = ["411:quadski", objective-flags, loop-count, value]
  objective-flags = ; as in the GRASP specification
  loop-count = ; as in the GRASP specification
  value = pledge-value / server-value
  pledge-value = [encrypted-password, pledge-PEM]
  server-value = encrypted-keys
  encrypted-password = bytes
  pledge-PEM = bytes
  encrypted-keys = bytes

   The encrypted-password is a previously agreed pledge password for the
   AN domain, RSA-encrypted using the public key of the server.  This
   password should not be the same as the keying password used in
   Section 2.

   The pledge-PEM is the PEM encoding of the public RSA key of the
   pledge node.

   The encrypted-keys value is the result of the following process:

   1.  Assume the symmetric cryptography in use is AES/CBC, key length
       32, initialisation vector length 16, padding PKCS7(128).

   2.  Let the key bytes be 'key' and the initialisation vector bytes be
       'iv'.

   3.  Construct the array object [key, iv].

   4.  Encode this object in CBOR.

   5.  Encrypt the resulting CBOR bytes with RSA using the public key of
       the pledge ("pledge-PEM").

   6.  The result is the value of "encrypted-keys".

   The QUADSKI server must have possession of the AN domain keys
   (Section 2) and the domain's pledge password when it starts up, by a
   method not specified here.  It then proceeds as follows:

   1.  Create an RSA key pair, store the private key, and prepare the
       PEM encoding of the public key ("server-PEM").

   2.  Start flooding out the "411:quadskip" objective with the "server-
       PEM" value, using the GRASP M_FLOOD message.

   3.  Start listening for negotiation requests (GRASP M_NEG_REQ) for
       the "411:quadski" objective.

   4.  Whenever it receives such a request, RSA-decrypt the "encrypted-
       password" using its private key.

   5.  If the password matches, recover the pledge's public key from the
       "pledge-PEM".

   6.  Generate the "encrypted-keys" value as described above, and reply
       (GRASP M_NEGOTIATE) with that value.

   7.  Normally, the pledge will reply with GRASP M_END and an O_ACCEPT
       option.

   Error conditions such as a password mismatch will be handled like any
   GRASP error condition, with GRASP M_END and an O_DECLINE option.

   The pledge proceeds as follows:

   1.  Create an RSA key pair, store the private key, and prepare the
       PEM encoding of the public key ("pledge-PEM").

   2.  Wait until it detects the flooded "411:quadskip" option, at which
       point it can recover the QUADSKI server's public key from the
       "server-PEM" value.

   3.  Request the pledge password from the user.

   4.  RSA-encrypt the password using the server's public key.

   5.  Use GRASP discovery (M_DISCOVER "411:quadski") to locate the
       QUADSKI server.

   6.  Construct a "411:quadski" objective whose value is [encrypted-
       password, pledge-PEM] as described above.

   7.  Start the negotiation process (M_NEG_REQ).

   8.  When it receives a successful reply (M_NEGOTIATE), RSA-decrypt
       the value using its own private key, decode the result from CBOR,
       and thus recover the QUADS keys [key, iv].

   9.  Close the GRASP session with M_END + O_ACCEPT.

   In the pledge and the QUADSKI server, RSA encryption and decryption
   should follow best current practice, e.g.  [RFC8017].  At present the
   following choices are recommended: public exponent 65537, key size
   2048, padding OAEP with MGF1, hash SHA256.

   As noted, this process uses unencrypted GRASP, since there are no
   QUADS keys available until it ends.  Unlike BRSKI
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra], it does not rely on any
   limitation to link-local traffic, since it is protected by asymmetric
   cryptography.  However, for this to work on an evolving network where
   nodes may enrol at any time, GRASP must run encrypted for nodes that
   have acquired QUADS keys and simultaneously unencrypted for the
   QUADSKI process.  The simplest way to achieve this is to run two
   GRASP instances as necessary.  In particular, a node that acts as a
   GRASP relay needs to be able to relay encrypted traffic (for enrolled
   nodes) and unencrypted traffic (for nodes needing to run the QUADSKI
   process).  Note that such instances will receive GRASP broadcasts
   that they cannot interpret (encrypted packets reaching an unencrypted
   GRASP instance, and vice versa).  These packets can be harmlessly
   discarded.

   Finally, the reader familiar with BRSKI may note that the QUADSKI
   server replaces the role of the BRSKI Registrar, and the unencrypted
   GRASP daemon replaces the role of the BRSKI Join Proxy.

4.  Implementation Status [RFC Editor: please remove]

   QUADS for GRASP has been implemented as a small extension to the
   Python GRASP prototype, using the Python 'cryptography' module.  The
   algorithm choices were:

   *  Encryption: AES/CBC, key lengths 32/16, padding PKCS7(128).

   *  Password hash: PBKDF2HMAC SHA256, length 32, 100000 iterations.

   *  Salt used for keying password hash:
      0xf474526a2e74accee189f1fbc1c34ceb.

   QUADSKI for GRASP has been implemented as two Python ASAs, known as
   'quadski.py' for the server and 'qpledge.py' for the pledge node.
   These also use the Python 'cryptography' module.

5.  Security Considerations

   QUADS provides effective secrecy for all GRASP messages, against any
   party not in possession of the relevant shared keys.  However, before
   a GRASP message is encrypted or after it is decrypted, it is not
   protected within the host.  Therefore, secrecy is only effective
   against nodes that do not contain a GRASP instance in possession of
   the keys.  Those nodes cannot send valid GRASP messages, and they
   cannot interpret intercepted GRASP messages, including multicasts.
   However, they might attempt traffic analysis.

   QUADS provides authentication of GRASP instances to the extent that
   they must be in possession of the relevant shared keys.

   QUADS depends on pre-configuration of keys, or on password entry and
   a public salt value, for each autonomic node, unless QUADSKI is in
   use.

   QUADS offers no defence against denial of service attacks.

   QUADSKI securely avoids the need for pre-configuration of keys except
   in a central server.  Nevertheless it requires each joining node to
   be in possession of the AN domain's pledge password, and there is
   presently no rekeying procedure without rebooting the whole autonomic
   network.

   The result is that QUADS provides an autonomic control plane with the
   above security characteristics.

6.  IANA Considerations
