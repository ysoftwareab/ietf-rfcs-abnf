Abstract

   This document defines the properties and data format for the SIP user
   agent identity profile data set.  The properties in this data set
   define identities or SIP address of records (AORs) related to
   incoming or outgoing SIP signaling on a user agent.  The identities
   may be those that are registered via the SIP REGISTER method or

   identities which are provisioned on the user agent.  These identities
   may be used or referenced when defining identity specific handling
   related to SIP features on the user agent.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] defines a configuration framework
   for finding, retrieving and change notification of profile data for
   SIP [RFC3261] user agents.  It is intended that the identity dataset
   defined in this document may be contained in the user and device
   profiles described in the configuration framework.
   [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets] defines a general XML schema to
   contain user agent profile data.  This document defines identity
   specific data by extending the profile data sets schema.

   In this document we define properties and XML schema which allow the
   definition of SIP identities, whether an identity should be
   registered with the SIP [RFC3261] REGISTER method and how.  In
   addition credential properties related to the identities need to
   support SIP DIGEST authentication are defined.  The information
   contained in the identity data set is intended to be sufficient to
   enable the user agent to store and/or retrieve the users' (or
   identities') certificates and private keys from the Credential
   Service as defined in [I-D.ietf-sipping-certs].  Certificate
   management where the certificate or private key for an identity is
   contained directly in a user agent profile is out of scope for this
   document.

   This document defines the properties and XML schema for the SIP user
   agent identity profile data set.  The following XML elements are
   defined to contain the identity properties in this document:
      sipIdentity
      aor
      locationRegistration
      registerPeriod
      qValue
      sipCredential
      realm
      authUser
      a1Digest
      password

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   Keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and
   "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119[RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   The sipIdentity element is the container for all of the properties



Petrie, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Data Set               November 2007


   related to a specific identity or AOR.  The identities defined in
   sipIdentity element(s) define identities for inbound or outbound SIP
   signaling from the user agent.  The use of the data contained in the
   sipIdentity element is intended to be independent from the particular
   SIP application (e.g.  VoIP, IM or presence).  From a VoIP
   perspective, the sipIdentity is similar to a line definition.
   However the sipIdentity element is not intended to contain all of the
   VoIP or call handling feature options and properties.  The
   sipIdentity element has an id attribute which can be used when
   defining identity specific feature behavior.  The definition of
   identity specific feature properties is out of scope of this
   document.  The sipIdentity attribute "id" is defined to enable
   feature properties to reference the identity(s) to which they are
   specific.

   The identity data set provides the ability to define which AORs to
   enable on a user agent and whether to register the AOR.  It also
   associates SIP digest authentication credentials with the AOR that
   the user agent may used when challenged.  [SIP] specifies that a UAS
   should reject incoming requests if "the Request-URI does not identify
   an address that the UAS is willing to accept requests for".  The
   identity data set provides a means to define the identities for the
   addresses that the UAS should accept.

   The sipIdentity element is considered to be atomic when it comes to
   merging.  That is all sipIdentity elements are taken in whole from
   the user and device profiles obtained via the ua-profile event
   package.  If duplicate AORs are found the one which occurred first
   when looking through the device and then user profiles is used and
   subsequent, duplicate sip-identity elements are ignored. [need
   reference for AOR comparison in 3261].  User agents that support a
   limited number of identities use the first N unique sipIdentity
   elements when searching through the profiles in the order described
   above, where N is the number of identities the user agent can
   support.

   The following excerpt of a SIP user agent profile is an example of
   the SIP identity data set.

       </sipCredential>
   </sipIdentity>


   In the above example the user has two identities.  Both of these
   identities may be contained in the user or device profile or one
   identity could be in the device profile and the other in the user
   profile.  Both identities have an id attribute which serves as a
   unique label or handle for the identity.  In this example case the
   first identity has an id of "home" the second has the id of "work".
   The id attribute values are only text labels and have no semantic
   meaning.  How this particular user got two identities in their
   profile is a profile delivery server implementation issue and is out
   of scope of this document.


3.  SIP Identity Data Set

   The XML schema defined in this document extends the root element
   "property_set" schema defined in
   [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets].

3.1.  sipIdentity Element

   sipIdentity -  This element contains properties related to a specific
      SIP identity or AOR.  It is an XML element that extends on the XML
      "setting_container" element contained in the root "property_set"
      element.  There MAY be zero or more sipIdentity elements in a
      property_set element.  The sipIdentity elements MAY appear in
      multiple profile (e.g. device and user).

   The sipIdentity element MUST contain one aor and locationRegistration
   element.  The sipIdentity element MAY contain zero or one
   registerPeriod, zero or one qValue, and zero or more sipCredential
   elements.  Contained in property_set.

   sipIdentity has two attributes: id and default. - type string.
   default - indicates this is the default line to for outbound, inbound
   or both directions.
   id -  is a label of type string (default value: "").  This label MAY
      be used by other user agent features to specify behavior that is
      specific to a particular identity.  For example a call handling
      feature such as "do not disturb" might be enabled for inbound
      calls to a specific identity.  The properties for the "do not
      disturb" feature could reference which identity using the string
      in the "id" attribute.  The "id" attribute is specified in this
      document, but user agent feature properties which use the "id"
      attribute (such as "do not disturb") are out of scope of this
      document.
   default -  specifies that the identity contained in this sipIdentity
      element is to be used as the default identity (default value: "").
      Possible values: "inbound", "outbound", "both".  No value
      indicates that this identity should only be used when specifically
      addressed by the inbound signaling or as indicated by the user for
      outbound initiated signaling.  A value of "inbound" means that
      this identity should be used for inbound signaling that does not
      match any of the other identities defined in other sipIdentity
      element.  A value of "inbound" also indicates that the user agent
      should accept incoming signaling that is not addressed to a
      specific identity defined in a sipIdentity element.  A value of
      "outbound" indicates that the user agent should use this identity
      as the default for outbound SIP signaling.  A value of "both" is
      the equivalent of "inbound" and "outbound" There SHOULD be at most
      one sipIdentity element with a "default" attribute of "inbound"
      and at most one with a value of "outbound" or one with a value of
      "both".  If more than one sipIdentity has the "default" attribute
      to indicate that it is the default for inbound or outbound
      signaling, the first occurrence is used when searching through the
      device and then user profiles.

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Data Set               November 2007


3.2.  aor Element

   The "aor" element is contained in the sipIdentity element.  The aor
   element specifies the SIP address of record for the identity.  The
   value of the aor element is in the form of the name-addr ABNF
   construct defined in SIP [RFC3261].  It is important to note that the
   name-addr construct may contain a display name, URI parameters and
   SIP message header parameters.  The user agent SHOULD include these
   parameters when constructing a Contact header for registration (if
   this identity is to be registered).  Exactly one aor element SHOULD
   be contained in a sipIdentity element.

3.3.  locationRegistration Element

   The "locationRegistration" element is used to indicate whether the
   user agent is to register the local Contact for this identity using
   the SIP [RFC3261] REGISTER method.  A value of "register" indicates
   that the user agent SHOULD register a Contact for this identity.  A
   value of "provisioned" indicates that the Contact is provisioned in
   the network and that the user agent SHOULD NOT register a Contact
   (Default value: "register").  Exactly one locationRegistration
   element SHOULD be contained in a sipIdentity element.

3.4.  registerPeriod Element

   The registerPeriod element MAY be used to indicate the Expiration
   header value in seconds to use in REGISTER requests for this
   identity.  This element is ignored unless the locationRegistration
   element indicates that the user agent SHOULD register.  The value of
   the registerPeriod element SHOULD be an integer greater than 1.
   (Default value: 3600) Zero or one registerPeriod element MAY be
   contained in a sipIdentity element.

3.5.  qValue Element

   The qValue element contains the value that SHOULD be used in the q
   field parameter of the Contact header when sending REGISTER request
   for this identity.  Zero or one qValue element MAY be included in the
   sipIdentity element.  The qValue element is meaningless unless the
   locationRegistration indicates that the user agent should register a
   contact.  The value of the qValue element is a decimal number between
   1.0 and 0.0 (the legal values for the qvalue ABNF construct in
   [RFC3261])

3.6.  sipCredential Element

   The sipCredential element contains the credentials for performing SIP
   [RFC3261] digest authentication related to a single realm.  As it is



Petrie, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Data Set               November 2007


   possible for a user agent to be challenged from multiple realms when
   sending SIP requests, zero or more sipCredential elements may be
   contained in a sipIdentity element.  The user agent SHOULD only use
   the credentials contained in the identity that is used for the
   outbound request.  That is, the user agent SHOULD not use credentials
   contained in other sipIdentity elements.  The sipCredential element
   SHOULD contain exactly one of each of the elements: realm, auth-user
   and one of either the a1Digest or password elements.

3.6.1.  realm Element

   The realm element contains the string that defines the realm to which
   this credential pertains.  The value of the realm element is the same
   as the realm parameter in the [RFC2617] headers: WWW-Authenticate,
   Authorization and the SIP [RFC3261] headers: Proxy-Authenticate and
   Proxy-Authorization.  When the user agent receives a authentication
   challenge (401 or 407 response), the user agent looks for a
   sipCredential element which contains a realm element that matches the
   realm parameter in the authorization response challenge.  If a match
   of the realm value is found, the user agent uses the values in the
   authUser and a1Digest elements contained in the sipCredential
   element.  Exactly one realm element SHOULD be contained in a
   sipCredential element.

3.6.2.  authUser Element

   The authUser element contains the string value of the username
   parameter which SHOULD be used in Authorization and Proxy-
   Authorization request headers when retrying a request that was
   challenged for authentication.  Exactly one authUser element SHOULD
   be contained in a sipCredential element.

3.6.3.  a1Digest Element

   The a1Digest element contains a string with the value of the A1
   digest of the username, realm and password as defined in [RFC2617].
   At most one a1Digest element MUST be contained in a sipCredential
   element.  The a1Digest element MUST NOT exist in a sipCredential
   element containing a password element.  The username and realm used
   to construct the value of the a1Digest element MUST match the values
   of the realm and authUser elements contained in the sipCredential
   element with the a1Digest element.

3.6.4.  password Element

   The password element contains the clear text password for use with
   DIGEST Authentication [RFC2617].  At most one password MUST be
   contained in a sipCredential element.  The password element MUST NOT

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Data Set               November 2007


   exist in a sipCredential element containing a a1Digest element.  The
   user agent uses this password along with the realm and authUser
   elements to calculate the A1 digest used for DIGEST Authentication.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security is mostly a profile delivery problem.  The delivery
   framework MUST provide a secure means of delivering the profile data
   as it may contain sensitive data that would be undesirable if it were
   stolen or sniffed.  Storage of the profile on the profile delivery
   server and user agent is an implementation problem.  The profile
   delivery server and the user agent MUST provide protection that
   prevents unauthorized access of the profile data.  The profile
   delivery server and the user agent MUST enforce the access control
   policies defined in the profile data sets if present.


5.  IANA Considerations

   XML name space registration: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:uaprof:id

5.1.  Content-type registration for 'application/uapid+xml'

   Optional parameters: charset  Indicates the character encoding of
      enclosed XML.  Default is UTF-8.
   Encoding considerations:  Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit
      characters, depending on the character encoding used.  See RFC
      3023 [RFC 3023], section 3.2.
   Security considerations:  This content type is designed to carry SIP
      user agent profile data, which may be considered private
      information.  Appropriate precautions should be adopted to limit
      disclosure of this information.
   Interoperability considerations:  This content type provides a common
      format for exchange of SIP user agent profile information.

6.1.  Changes from draft-petrie-sipping-identity-dataset-01

   Re-revved and activated draft

6.2.  Changes from draft-petrie-sipping-identity-dataset-00

   Converted the DTD schema to use Relax NG schema.

   Defined XML name space for schema: "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:uaprof:id"

   Defined mime type: application/uapid+xml to be used as default
   content type for the configuration framework.

   Changed names of elements, attributes and other data types which
   contained "-" or "_" to use camel case.

   Added password element so that credential can contain either A1
   digest or clear text password as the clear text password is required
   by the user agent in some cases to wildcard the realm.
