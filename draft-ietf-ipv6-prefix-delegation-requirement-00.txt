Abstract


   This document describes requirements about how an IPv6 address prefix
   should be delegated to an IPv6 subscriber's  network (or "site").





















Motivation

   With the deployment of IPv6 [Deering, 1998] ,several commercial ISPs
   are ready to offer their services to the public in conjunction with
   widely deployed IP subscription method such as ADSL and so on.  But,
   thinking about following situation of IPv6 commercial service as one
   of the most likely examples,

           IPv6 ISP router
             |
             | point-to-point link
             |
           User's Site router
             |
         ----+----- User's Site Network

   though it is needed a standardized way to delegate one or more IPv6
   address prefix(es) from the IPv6 ISP to the User's site
   automatically, it is not identified clearly yet.

   Originally, it seemed that just RA (Router Avertisement) considered
   as good enough to be used for P-P link between ISP and User's site,
   but according to the NCCs' recommendations, one site should be
   delegated /48 usually.

   So, ISP which now would like to start its own IPv6 commercial service
   TODAY, need to have some method other than RA protocol which only can
   handle one signle /64 prefix but something else or enhanced

   - to delegate not just one signle /64 prefix to the user - to satisfy
   all the other (standard) requirements which is needed to realize
   commercial service

   Therefore, this documents clarifies requirements for IPv6 address
   prefix delegation from the ISP to the site, especially from the
   (commercial) ISP point of view to boost IPv6 business quick as
   possible.

   Requirements for prefix delegation management
   Focusing commercial IPv6 ISP service, there are several kinds of
   category of requirements for the mechanism / protocol to delegate one
   or more IPv6 prefixes from ISP to a site.

   - layer 2 consideration

   The method should work on any layer 2 technologies.  In other words,
   it should be layer 2 technology independent.  Though, at the same
   time, it should be noted that now ISP would like to have a solution
   for Point-to-Point link which has own authentication mechanism first.
   PPP link with CHAP authentication is a good example.  (Simulated)
   Ethernet and IEEE802.11 (wireless LAN) should be covered in near
   future, but they have low priority (just) for now.  It should be
   clarified that the method should work with all L2 protocols either
   with authentication mechanism or without, but ISP would like to take
   advantage of a L2 protocol's authentication mechanism if it exits.

   - accounting

   It should provide accounting capability such as logging about by
   whom, when and what prefix(es) is used for the service with proper
   authentication techniques.

   - kinds of prefixes

   It should be able to delegate both statically and dynamically
   assigned prefix assignment by authenticated identification, depended
   by resources and/or any reasons.

   - negotiation between ISP and site

   ISP may deny the service, due to various reasons such as there is no
   contract or bad financial credit etc.  Also ISP should be able to use
   one single technique to pass parameters of the prefix such as scope
   (global and/or site), prefix length (/48, /64 or any other length)
   and any other appropriate related information to the site.  On the
   other hand, a site should be able to request multiple prefixes to the
   ISP.  Also a site should be able to pass parameters of the prefix
   such as scope (global and/or site), prefix length (/48, /64 or any
   other length), number of prefixes and so on to the ISP to negotiate.

   - less impact on ISP equipments

   ISP usualy use some kind of equipment to provide subscription service
   to the users such as access concentrating router, PPP server and so
   on.  This may aggregate thousands or more connections toward the
   ISP's backbone.  Prefix delegation mechanism must be compatible with
   this situation.

   People in Internet Association of Japan have gave me a lot of good input.
   Team members of NTT Communications IPv6 project, especially Toshi Yamasaki
   and Yasuhiro Shirasaki, gave me quite useful suggestions for this
   document. Chairs of IETF IPv6 working group especially Bob Hinden
   who gave me a good suggestions before I submitted this draft.
   Also communications with other folks in the IPv6 community, such
   as WIDE/KAME project, IPv6 and DHCP teams in Cisco systems and so on have
   been quite helpful. Thanks a lot.
