                           The New Webiquette
               draft-rfcxml-general-the-new-webiquette-00

Abstract

   The inspiration for this document came from RFC 1855 ("Netiquette"),
   which is now partially obsolete and no longer maintained.  A lot has
   happened on the Internet since then (social media, video
   conferencing, deepfakes, ad networks), which should be applied in a
   netiquette.  Like in RFC 1855 this is only a minimal standard.

1.  Introduction

   A Webiquette to make the internet a better place.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Status of the Memo

   This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.

3.  User Guidelines"

   For making the Internet a place where many people feel comfortable,
   it needs some rules.  What you can do in particular as a regular user
   can be found in section 1.1 to 1.4.

4.  One-to-One-Messaging

   We are talking about a direct conversation with a person (in
   writing).  This can be via email, chat, private message in social
   media or similar.

   *  If you Do not have anything important to say, say nothing.

   *  Ensure you are calm before you reply.  If needed try to wait a
      night before reacting to a text.

   *  Avoid sentences that are written exclusively in capital letters.
      This looks as if YOU ARE SHOUTING.

   *  Use smilies or emojies to convey emotions in a message.  Use them
      wisely and not excessively ;-)

   *  Use irony and sarcasm wisely.  Your counterpart does not see you
      and your text might come across as overly agressive.

   *  Speaking of language.  Do not impose your language on other
      people.  Do not (impose to) correct other persons' way of
      speaking.

   *  If someone is using a nickname/pseudonym/username, respect the
      users privacy, even if you know the person.  Do not use the real
      name online without permission.

   *  Assume when you write an email or a private message on social
      media that it can be read and analyzed by third parties.  Think
      carefully about what you write or use proper encryption.

   *  Your counterpart may have another cultural background, other
      values, speaks other languages or has a different form of humor
      than you do.  Keep that in mind when communicating.

   *  Keep in mind that people may be located all around the globe when
      communicating online.  Do not assume an immediate response.  The
      person could be sleeping, at work, or busy otherwise.

   *  Do not expect strangers on the Internet to help you with general
      technical questions.  Do not just write to people you know on the
      Internet and expect a response to help you.  If you have technical
      questions, turn to appropriate internet forums, mailing lists,
      chat rooms etc. who are there to help.

   *  Do not send chain letters.  Just do not.

   *  Do not send an unsolicited wall of text.  People are busy and do
      not have the time to read through unfiltered content.  If you can
      not avoid a long text: Proofread it, make it more readable (e.g.
      add more paragraphs) and check if the context makes sense before
      you send it.  If necessary include a short summary.

   *  If you answer to a longer text or a couple of days later make sure
      you Do not send TOFU (Text Over, Fullquote Under).  Always refer
      or quote the paragraphs you are answering to and shorten your
      reply by skipping the unnecessary parts.

   *  Do not send SPAM e-mails.  A lot of countries have Anti-Spam-Laws.

   *  Do not distribute pornographic (e.g. nude pictures) or violent
      material.  Not even if it is already on the Internet.  You never
      know if the people who are on the pictures know about it or if the
      recipient wants to see it.

   *  Some social networks push you via gamification to send a picture
      every day to people close to you, which leads to many pictures of
      shoes, trains and other things just to achieve this goal.  A
      friendship is not bound to such things.  Remember that you can
      disturb other people in public and/or violate privacy laws.  Also
      remember that the picture you send to your friend also consumes
      bandwidth and money.

   *  Always check if your messaging a single person or a group of
      people before sending.

   *  Implement the RFC rule RFC760 and RFC791: In general, an
      implementation should be conservative in its sending behavior, and
      liberal in its receiving behavior for Messages: In general, a
      message should be conservative in its sending behavior, and
      liberal in its receiving behavior.

5.  One-to-Many-Messaging

   This can represent a conversation with several participants via mail,
   mailing lists, chat, forum, microblogging services, social media or
   similar.  All rules from One-to-One Messaging also appear to One-to-
   Many Messaging but One-to-Many also includes:

   *  Read the comments in a room before you participate in a
      discussion.  When the atmosphere is already heated up, do not put
      oil in the flames.

   *  Do not hijack a topic or post.  Thread hijacking means when
      someone opens a thread on a forum or comment a certain topic that
      a single person or more use this thread for off-topic, have a
      conversation within the conversation or point or use it for other
      opportunities e. g. other cases (or making money).  This is rude
      behaviour.  Open a topic by yourself about what you would would
      like to talk about, but do not use a popular topic for your own
      profit.

   *  Before you ask a question use a search engine.  Do not expect
      anyone to serve you the answers, especially if they are easy to
      find.  But do not do it if it is a personal question.

   *  >Adapt your language to the subculture you are joining.  If you
      talk in a very high-pitched way in a casual forum, no one will
      take you seriously.  Just as you should remain formal in a
      professional business forum.

   *  Ask permission before reposting any text.  With a #followerpower
      or similar tag you can usually assume that the text can be
      reposted.

   *  Do not take screenshots of forum posts, posts, video conferences
      and share them with third parties (not even in a "private" chat)
      without first asking permission from all concerned.

   *  Do not participate in flamewars and shitstorms.  Neither by
      posting or reacting to one.

   *  Make sure your posts are readable.  Use proper punctuation.  Also
      Do not (ab)use special characters for your sentence to look
      "cooler".  This is important for all people who use a
      screenreader.  Avoid too many special characters in your text such
      as / * : + # - remember this will also be read by a screenreader
      in most cases

   *  Speaking of screenreaders: If you add a picture to a post, use an
      alternative text to describe its contents, so someone who can not
      see also has a chance to grasp its context.

   *  Do not post information of others (also called doxxing) such as
      names, photos, contact information without explicit permission.
      Also keep in mind that a lot of countries have strict privacy
      laws.

   *  Do not publicly ask users for their name, age, gender, ethnicity,
      place of residence, religion, sexual orientation, political
      interest or even indirectly for skin color.  Personal information
      of other users are none of your business and they will tell them
      to you if there is any need to do so.

   *  In contexts where you are unsure about the used nick for someone
      or when unsure if all know that person's identity try to avoid
      such explicit markers.

   *  When discussing books, series, movies or games that others may not
      have read, seen or played, add the word "SPOILER" at the beginning
      of the sentence before telling story parts.  Others should still
      be able to look forward to the content.

   *  Respect copyrighted material.

   *  Do not publicly archive content without permission.  If the owner
      puts his content offline, respect that.  Also, you may be
      violating copyright and privacy laws in some countries.

   *  Treat people as individuals.  Do not write about to which group of
      people you do not want to talk to.  This comes across as
      aggressive.

   *  Check if it is allowed to advertise on platforms before doing so.

6.  Videoconferences

   Video conferencing has become an integral part of our daily lives, so
   it's important that we use courtesies here as well.

   *  Do not record video or VoIP conferences without consent or
      permission.  Violation of this rule is a criminal offense in some
      jurisdictions.

   *  If you are not speaking, mute yourself.

   *  Check your audio setup before entering conferences.

   *  Use a headset to avoid background noises.

   *  Respect if people Do not want to switch on their camera.

   *  If you have personal belongings in the background e. g. photos of
      your family or friends consider moving them away or blurring the
      video stream.

   *  If you are in two or more video conferences at the same time or
      you lurking around in a conference just in case someone shows up,
      make sure you mute one conference when you're joining another.
      Best would be you only join one conference at a time.

   *  Mute yourself when you sneeze, cough, burp.  If you can not mute
      in time, apologize.

7.  The Internet Use in General

Internet-Draft             The New Webiquette              February 2022


   *  Do not use other people's voices or video files to create
      deepfakes, even if you do not intend to post them publicly.  You
      do not know how responsibly the program and the AI behind it
      handles people's data.  Always get permission first.

   *  If you post something in modeated places and it doesn't show up
      right away, wait and do not post it again.  Some posts need to be
      approved first.

   *  Do not film or photograph people in distress (accident, argument,
      etc.) without permission.  In many cultures, this is considered
      rude and illegal.  Especially when you want to put it online
      afterwards.  Always ask for permission.

8.  Admin Guidelines

   *  As an administrator and moderator you are a role model.  Act like
      one.

   *  Check your websites privacy and security BEFORE you put it online.

   *  Provide contact information and check your mail regulary.

   *  Respond quickly to user concerns, especially when there is illegal
      content involved.

   *  Make sure that your privacy policy and your imprint (if required)
      are easy to understand and complete.

   *  Deliver on what you promise in the privacy policy.

   *  Remove personal user content, if your user asks for it.  Observe
      the developments regarding data privacy laws in affected
      legislations and countries.

   *  Have a postmaster and a root alias address.

   *  Provide a security.txt in case security researchers find
      vulnerabilities in your system.

   *  Provide a robots.txt or/and adjust security settings against
      crawlers, if you provide personal information on your page.

   *  Make sure you have an FAQ page, if necessary, and you update it
      frequently.

   *  Have guidelines on how to deal with unlawful behaviour.  Ensure
      consistent application of those rules.

   *  Monitor your systems.

   *  Time passes quickly: What is current today can be outdated
      tomorrow.  Ensure to date your articles, posts and other
      materials.Keep your documentation up-to-date.  If you know
      information is out-of-date make sure to mark it as such or delete
      it.  If someone is new to a topic or otherwise unfamiliar with
      specifics this may otherwise lead to people relying on those old
      information and thus making bad or even incorrect decisions based
      on it.  In extreme cases this may even lead to security risks or
      even injury.

   *  When managing an community always act as just as possible and make
      your decisions transparent.  Be impartial in your decisions and
      apply them equally in comparable situations.

   *  Last but not least: Treat users fair.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are not part of this memo.
