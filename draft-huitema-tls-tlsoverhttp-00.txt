Abstract

   We observe that attacks against HTTPS are getting more and more
   popular.  The attacks typically exploit weaknesses in PKI certificate
   verification software.  These weaknesses allow a third party to
   insert itself as a Man-In-The-Middle in a TLS connection, accessing
   the content of messages that were previously encrypted and in some
   case changing these messages.

   TLS over HTTP allows clients and servers to carry a TLS conversation
   on top of HTTP, and thus bypass the man-in-the-middle attackers.
   Different deployment models are possible, e.g., HTTP over TLS over
   HTTP, application-layer-protocol over TLS over HTTP, or HTTP over TLS
   over HTTP over TLS.

   The proposed solution allows for reuse of the existing TLS
   implementation, thus minimizing the development costs and risks.  It
   includes an optional obfuscation layer, to maximize the likelihood of
   working unnoticed by firewalls and other MITM boxes.

1.  Introduction

   Following the Snowden revelation, there has been an increased push to
   deploy encryption over the Internet.  The IAB reinforced this trend
   by publishing the IAB Statement on Internet Confidentiality
   [IABConfidentiality].  Of course, every action brings a reaction, and
   the push for encryption is countered by the deployment of encryption-
   breaking middleboxes.  The middle boxes typically use weaknesses in
   the Certificate Verification system of popular TLS implementations to
   insert themselves as "Man in the middle" (MITM).  In another class of
   attacks, the middleboxes will simply block encrypted communication,
   only allowing clear-text HTTP.

   The MITM attacks against TLS can be detected in various ways.  For
   example, the TLS client might have obtained in advanced a good copy
   of the certificate used by the TLS server.  The client can then
   compare the value used in the TLS exchange to the value in the good

   copy.  If they differ, the MITM attack is detected.  However, in the
   current state of the art, the only choice of the client is either to
   abort the connection, or to tolerate the encryption compromise by the
   middlebox.

   Both the MITM attack and the clear-text only attacks can be mitigated
   by running TLS on top of HTTP (HTLS).

2.  TLS over HTTP architecture

   The basic TLS over HTTP architecture has four layers, including a
   framing layer which is conceptually placed between TLS and HTTP.

   +-------------+
   | application |
   +-------------+
   |     TLS     |
   +-------------+
   |   Framing   |
   +-------------+
   |    HTTP     |
   +-------------+

                                 Figure 1

   The framing layer is responsible for encapsulating the TLS frames
   into the HTTP protocol.

   Figure 1 describes the simplest stack, in which we assume that HTTP
   is run "end to end."  There are many possible variants, including in
   particular the HTTPS variant, in which HTTP is run over TLS.  In that
   case, we will effectively see two instances of TLS running on top of
   each other.

   +-------------+
   | application |
   +-------------+
   |     TLS     |
   +-------------+
   |   Framing   |
   +-------------+
   |    HTTP     |
   +-------------+
   |     TLS     |

   Having two instances of TLS obviously causes some amount of overhead.
   It is however the price to pay in order to actually traverse series
   of middleboxes while establishing end-to-end encryption.

   This document defines framing of HTLS over web sockets [RFC6455].
   There may be a need in the future to provide more options.  For
   example, if middleboxes started to deploy inspection software to
   detect and prevent usage of HTLS over web sockets, there will be a
   need to define some form of obfuscation, rendering the content as
   indistinguishable as possible from regular HTTP content.  The new
   semantics introduced in HTTP/2.0 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2] will
   probably allow for efficient implementation of such encapsulations.

3.  Framing with web sockets

   The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] enables applications to transmit
   arbitrary binary messages over a channel that is initiated as HTTP or
   HTTPS.  The WebSocket protocol is compatible with HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616]
   and with HTTP over TLS [RFC2818].

   When using the web socket framing, the client will establish a web
   socket using the URI reserved by the server for HTLS over web
   sockets.  Once the web socket has reached the OPEN state, both client
   and server will be able to send and receive data frames, as defined
   in section 6 of [RFC6455].  Each TLS frame will be sent as a separate
   web socket data frame.

   The client will start the TLS handshake as defined for the client-
   chosen version of TLS in [RFC2246], [RFC5246], or
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  The client and server will then execute the
   TLS protocol, and carry the application protocol inside TLS data
   frames.

   We should note that, while the framing layer is conceptually layered
   above HTTP, the WebSocket protocol really replaces HTTP after the
   initial negotiations.  The architecture diagram with WebSocket
   framing really looks like:

                 +-------------------+
                 |    application    |
                 +-------------------+
                 |        TLS        |
   +-------------+-------------------+
   |    HTTP     | WebSocket Framing |
   +-------------+-------------------+

4.  HTLS parameters

   An application that starts an HTLS connection will need to specify a
   the HTTP or HTTPS URI used to establish the underlying HTTP
   connection and the type of framing required for the encapsulation.
   We assume that these parameters will be passed as an end to end
   exchange between server and clients, prior to the establishment of
   the HTLS connection.

5.  MITM bypass scenario

   As stated in Section 1, one of the main motivation for HTLS is to
   offer a better choice to the user when a secure connection is
   compromised by an MITM attack.

   Client         |      MITM      |   Server
   ---------------+----------------+--------------
                  |                |

   connection ----------->         |
                  |   intercept    |
                  |      --------------->
                  |                | establish TLS
                  |      <---------------
                  |    modify      |
           <---------------        |
   Detect         |                |
   Modification   |                |

   WebSocket  -------------------------->
           <-----------------------------
   Establish      |                |
   HTLS    ----------------------------->
           <-----------------------------

                                 Figure 4

   The exchanges depicted in Figure 4 are easy to understand, but a few
   of the actions require further explanation:

   o  How does the client detect the modification?





Huitema                Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            TLS over HTTP (HTLS)                March 2015


   o  How does the client know that the server can use HTLS, and what
      parameters should it use?

   o  What about performance degradation?

   There is lots of work going on in the IETF and in the industry to
   detect attacks against TLS.  The most popular attack involves the
   forging of certificates by the MITM, as done for example by the
   "Superfish" software [Superfish].  The MITM will generate a fake
   certificate for the target, have it signed by a certificate authority
   under its control, and somehow convince the security software on the
   client side to trust that certificate authority.  The client can
   detect the attack if it knows the "right" certificate for the server
   and observes a mismatch.  The client could also apply some logic to
   find suspicious characteristics in the certificate provided by the
   MITM, and detect the fakery.

   Once the client decides that the certificate is probably fake, it has
   to establish a WebSocket session to the server, and for that it needs
   parameters.  In fact, since the client already knows the name of the
   server and has already decided to use the WebSocket protocol over
   TLS, it needs just one parameter, the URI of the HTLS web socket
   service on the server.  The simplest solution is to use a constant
   value, "HTLS."  Successful establishment of a web socket through that
   URI indicates that the server supports HTLS.

   Clearly, using HTLS degrades performance.  There are a number of
   additional handshakes before any application data can be exchanged,
   some additional overhead due to encapsulation errors, and a computing
   charge for running the encryption twice.  Running HTLS is thus a
   tradeoff.  In the absence of HTLS, the client's only choices are to
   drop the connection, or accept working in an insecure manner.  HTLS
   adds a third choice, a way to bypass the MITM attack at the cost of
   reduced performance.  There will be cases where secure and slow is
   better than either no connection at all or an insecure connection.

6.  Winning the cat and mouse game

   Deceiving the MITM attacker is of course a game of "cat and mouse."
   The mice (the victims), in that case, are taking evasive action to
   escape the cat (the MITM attacker).  HTLS is one of these evasive
   actions.  It will work as long as the attackers are not aware of it,
   but we have to assume that smarter mice beget smart cats.  That is
   the reason for having an optional "framing" layer as part of the
   architecture.

   The first instantiation of the framing uses web sockets and a
   standard URI at the server, but it is reasonably easy for an attacker



Huitema                Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            TLS over HTTP (HTLS)                March 2015


   to detect that.  The answer is of course to include some level of
   obfuscation in the framing layer, so that HTLS traffic is difficult
   to distinguish from other web traffic.  The simplest obfuscation is
   to keep the web socket encapsulation, but make the URI parameter hard
   to discover by third parties.  Instead of using the constant string
   "HTLS," servers can come up with their own creative names.  If the
   server and the client cooperate, they can vary these names over time
   according to some pre-established schedule.  At that point, it
   becomes hard for the MITM to distinguish HTLS from other types of web
   sockets.  The MITM attacker now is left with two options: block all
   web socket traffic, or allow HTLS to pass unmolested.

   If it turns out that MITM attackers are willing to ban all web socket
   traffic, we will have to study a different form of framing.  This
   should probably be based on HTTP/2.0 support for multiple streams and
   bidirectional transmissions.  We could imagine sending each TLS frame
   as a separate page, with the set of pages multiplexed over the
   HTTP/2.0 connection.  The frame will be encoded as page content,
   which could be binary, but could also be some sophisticated text or
   image representation designed to elude MITM censorship.  This is of
   course for further study.

   In the end game, the MITM attacker should be left with the choice of
   allowing HTLS or blocking all web traffic.  Some attackers may indeed
   choose to block everything, but most will probably just give up.

7.  Security Considerations

   The draft addresses a major security issue, the interception of
   secure connections by middleboxes that break the end to end nature of
   encryption.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.

9.  Acknowledgments
