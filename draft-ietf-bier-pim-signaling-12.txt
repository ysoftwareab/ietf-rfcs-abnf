                    PIM Signaling Through BIER Core
                    draft-ietf-bier-pim-signaling-12

Abstract

   Consider large networks deploying traditional PIM multicast service.
   Typically, each portion of these large networks have their own
   mandates and requirements.  It might be desirable to deploy BIER
   technology in some part of these networks to replace traditional PIM
   services.  In such cases downstream PIM states need to be signaled
   over the BIER Domain toward the source.

   This draft specifies the procedure to signal PIM join/prune messages
   through a BIER Domain, as such enabling the provisioning of
   traditional PIM services through a BIER Domain.  These procedures are
   valid for forwarding PIM join/prune messages to the Source (SSM) or
   Rendezvous Point (ASM).

Internet-Draft       PIM Signaling Through BIER Core           July 2021


1.  Introduction

   It might be desirable to simplify/upgrade some part of an existing
   network to BIER technology, removing any legacy multicast protocols
   like PIM.  This simplification should be done with minimum
   interruption or disruption to the other parts of the network from
   singling, services and software upgrade point of view.  To do so this
   draft is specifies procedures for signaling multicast join and prune
   messages over the BIER domain, this draft is not trying to create
   FULL PIM adjacency over a BIER domain between two PIM nodes.  The PIM
   adjacency is terminated at BIER edge routers and only join/prune
   signaling messages are transported over the BIER network.  It just so
   happened that this draft chose signaling messages to be in par with
   PIM join/prune messages.  These signaling messages are forwarded
   upstream toward the BIER edge router on path to the Source or
   Rendezvous point.  These signaling messages are encapsulated in a
   BIER header.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Definitions

   An understanding of the BIER architecture [RFC8279] and the related
   terminology is expected.  The following are some of the new
   definitions used in this draft.

   BBR:

   BIER Boundary router.  A router between the PIM domain and BIER
   domain.  Maintains PIM adjacency for all routers attached to it on
   the PIM domain and terminates the PIM adjacency toward the BIER
   domain.

   IBBR:

   Ingress BIER Boundary Router.  An ingress router from signaling point
   of view.  It maintains PIM adjacency toward the PIM domain and
   signals join/prune messages across the BIER domain to EBBR as needed.

   EBBR:

   Egress BIER Boundary Router.  An egress router in BIER domain from
   signaling point of view.  It maintains PIM adjacency to all upstream
   PIM routers.  It terminates the BIER signaling packets and creates
   necessary PIM join/prune messages into PIM Domain.

                       Figure 1: BIER boundary router

   Figure 1 illustrates the operation of the BIER Boundary router (BBR).
   BBRs are connected to PIM routers in the PIM domain and BIER routers
   in the BIER domain.  PIM routers in PIM domain continue to send PIM
   state messages to the BBR.  The BBR will create PIM adjacency between
   all the PIM routers attached to it on the PIM domain.  Each BBR
   determines if a BIER Signaling Join or Prune message needs to be
   transmitted through the BIER domain.  This draft has chosen these
   BIER signaling messages to be PIM join/prune message, as such an
   implementation could chose to tunnel actual PIM join/prune messages
   through BIER network.  This tunneling is only done for signaling
   purposes and not for creating a PIM adjacency between the two
   disjoint PIM domains through the BIER domain.

   The terminology ingress BBR (IBBR) and egress BBR (EBBR) is relative
   only from a signaling point of view.

   The egress BBR will determine if the arriving BIER packet is a
   signaling packet and if so it will generate a PIM join/prune packet
   toward its attached PIM domain.

   The new procedures in this draft are only applicable to signaling and
   there are no changes from datapath point of view.

3.1.  Ingress BBR procedure

   The IBBR maintains a PIM adjacency [RFC7761] with any PIM router
   attached to it on the PIM domain.

   When a PIM Join or Prune message is received, the IBBR determines
   whether the Source or RP is reachable through the BIER domain.  The
   EBBR is the BFR through which the Source or RP is reachable.  In PIM
   terms [RFC7761], the EBBR is the RPF Neighbor, and the RPF Interface
   is the BIER "tunnel" used to reach it.  The mechanisms used to find
   the EBBR are outside the scope of this document and there can be many
   mechanism depending on if the source or RP are in same area or
   autonomous system (AS) or in different area or AS -- some examples
   are provided in Appendix A.

   If the lookup for source or rendezvous point results into multiple
   EBBRs, different IBBRs could choose different EBBRs for the same
   flow.  As long as a unique IBBR chooses a unique EBBR for the same
   flow.  On downstream these EBBRs will send traffic to their
   corresponding IBBRs.

   After discovering the EBBR and its BFR-id, the IBBR MUST use the BIER
   Information Vector (Section 3.1.1) which is a PIM Join Attribute type
   [RFC5384].  The EBBR uses this attribute to obtain the necessary BIER
   information to build its multicast state.  The signaling packet, in
   this case a PIM Join/Prune message, is encapsulated in the BIER
   Header and forwarded through the BIER domain to the EBBR.  The source
   address of the PIM packets MUST be set to IBBR local BFR-prefix.  The
   destination address MUST be set to ALL-PIM-ROUTERS [RFC7761].

   The IBBR will track all the PIM interfaces on the attached PIM domain
   which are interested in a certain (S,G).  It creates multicast states
   for arriving join messages from PIM domain, with incoming interface
   as BIER "tunnel" interface and outgoing interface as the PIM domain
   interface(s) on which PIM Join(s) were received on.

3.1.1.  New Pim Join Attribute, BIER Information Vector

   The new PIM Join Attribute " BIER Information Vector" is defined as
   follow based on [RFC5384]

   BIERHeader.BitString= Bit corresponding to the BFR-id of the EBBR

   BIERHeader.BFIR-id = BFR-Id of the BBR originating the encapsulated
   signaling packet, i.e. the IBBR.

   Rest of the values in the BIER header are determined based on the
   network (MPLS/non-MPLS), capabilities (BSL), and network
   configuration.

3.2.  Signaling PIM through the BIER domain procedure

   Throughout the BIER domain the BIER forwarding procedure is according
   to [RFC8279].  No BIER router will examine the BIER the signaling
   packet.  As such there is no multicast state built in the BIER
   domain.

   The packet will be forwarded through the BIER domain until it reaches
   the EBBR indicated by the BIERHeader.Bitstring.  Only this targeted
   EBBR router will remove the BIER header and examine the PIM IPv4 or
   IPv6 signaling packet further as per EBBR Procedure section.

3.3.  EBBR procedure

   EBBR removes the BIER Header and determine this is a signaling
   packet.  The Received signaling packet, PIM join/prune message, is
   processed as if it were received from neighbors on a virtual
   interface, (i.e. as if the pim adjacency was present, regardless of
   the fact that there is no adjacency).

   The EBBR will build a forwarding table for the arriving (S,G) using
   the obtained BFIR-id and the Sub-Domain information from BIER Header
   and/or the PIM join Attributes added to the signaling packet.  In
   short it tracks all IBBRs interested in this (S,G).  For a specific
   Source and Group, EBBR SHOULD track all the interested IBBRs via
   signaling messages arriving from the BIER Domain.  BFER builds its
   (s,g) forwarding state with incoming interface (IIF) as the Reverse
   Path Forwarding (RPF) interface (in attached PIM domain) towards the
   source or rendezvous point.  The outgoing interfaces include a
   virtual interface that represent BIER forwarding to tracked IBBRs.

   The EBBR maintains a PIM adjacency [RFC7761] with any PIM router
   attached to it on the PIM domain.  At this point the end-to-end
   multicast traffic flow setup is complete.

Internet-Draft       PIM Signaling Through BIER Core           July 2021


4.1.  Datapath traffic flow

   When multicast data traffic arrives on the BFIR (EBBR) it forwards
   the traffic, through the BIER domain, to all interested IBBRs
   following the procedures specified in [RFC8279].  The BFER(s)
   (IBBR(s)) also follow the procedures in [RFC8279] and forward the
   multicast packet through its outgoing interface(s).

5.  PIM-SM behavior

   The procedures described in this document can be used with Any-Source
   Mutlicast (ASM) as long as a static Rendezvous Point (RP) or embedded
   RP for IPv6 is used[RFC3956].

   It should be noted that this draft only signals PIM Joins and Prunes
   through the BIER domain and not any other PIM message types including
   PIM Hellos or Asserts.  As such functionality related to these other
   type of massages will not be possible through a BIER domain with this
   draft and future drafts might cover these scenarios.  As an example
   DR selection should be done in the PIM domain or if the PIM routers
   attached to IBBRs are performing DR selection there needs to be a
   dedicated PIM interface between these routers.  The register messages
   are unicas encapsulatedt from the source to RP as such they are
   forwarded without these procedures.

   In case of PIM ASM Static RP or embedded RP for IPv6 the procedure
   for leaves joining RP is the same as above.  It should be noted that
   for ASM, the EBBRs are determined with respect to the RP instead of
   the source.

6.  Applicability to MVPN

   With just minor changes, the above procedures apply to MVPN as well,
   with BFIR/BFER/EBBR/IBBR being VPN PEs.  All the PIM related
   procedures, and the determination of EBBR happens in the context of a
   VRF, following procedures for PIM-MVPN.

   When a PIM packet arrives from PIM domain attached to the VRF (IBBR),
   and it is determined that the source is reachable via the VRF through
   the BIER domain, a PIM signaling message is sent via BIER to the
   EBBR.  In this case usually the PE terminating the PIM-MVPN is the
   EBBR.  A label is imposed before the BIER header is imposed, and the
   "proto" field in the BIER header is set to 1 (for "MPLS packet with
   downstream-assigned label at top of stack").  The label is advertised
   by the EBBR/BFIR to associate incoming packets to its correct VRF.
   In many scenarios a label is already bound to the VRF loopback
   address on the EBBR/BFIR and it can be used.

Internet-Draft       PIM Signaling Through BIER Core           July 2021


   When a multicast data packet is sent via BIER by an EBBR/BFIR, a
   label is imposed before the BIER packet is imposed, and the "proto"
   field in the BIER header is set to 1 (for "MPLS packet with
   downstream-assigned label at top of stack").  The label is assigned
   to the VPN consistently on all VRFs
   [draft-zzhang-bess-mvpn-evpn-aggregation-label-01].

   If the more complicated label allocation scheme is needed for the
   data packets as specified in
   [draft-zzhang-bess-mvpn-evpn-aggregation-label-01], then additional
   PMSI signaling is needed as specified in [RFC6513].

   To support per-area subdomain in this case, the ABRs would need to
   become VPN PEs and maintain per-VPN state so it is unlikely
   practical.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value (TBD) to the BIER Information
   Vector PIM Join Attribute from the PIM Join Attribute Types registry.

8.  Security Considerations

   The procedures of this document do not, in themselves, provide
   privacy, integrity, or authentication for the control plane or the

Appendix A.  Determining the EBBR

   This appendix provides some examples of routing procedures that can
   be used to determine the EBBR at the IBBR.

A.1.  Link-State Protocols

   On IBBR SPF procedures can be used to find the EBBR closest to the
   source.

   Assuming the BIER domain consists of all BIER forwarding routers, SPF
   calculation can identify the router advertising the prefix for the
   source.  A post process can find the EBBR by walking from the
   advertising router back to the IBBR in the reverse direction of
   shortest path tree branch until the first BFR is encountered.

A.2.  Indirect next-hop

   Alternatively, the route to the source could have an indirect next-
   hop that identifies the EBBR.  These methods are explained in the
   following sections.

A.2.1.  Static Route

   A static route to the source can be configured on the IBBR with the
   next-hop set as the EBBR's BFR-prefix.

A.2.2.  Interior Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP)

   Consider the following topology:

                          EBBR                  IBBR
            |--PIM Domain--|-----BIER domain-----|--PIM domain--|
       S--( A )----------( B ) ---- ( C ) ---- ( D )----------( E )--h

                           Figure 5: Static Route

   Suppose BGP is enable between EBBR (B) and IBBR (D) and the PIM
   Domain routes are redistributed to the BIER domain via BGP,
   performing next-hop-self for these routes.  This would include the
   Multicast Source IP address (S).  In such case BGP should use the
   same next-hop as the EBBR BIER prefix.  This will ensure that all PIM
   domain routes, including the Multicast Source IP address (S) are
   resolve via EBBR's BIER prefix address.  When the host (h) triggers a
   PIM join message to IBBR (D), IBBR tries to resolve (S).  It resolves
   (S) via BGP installed route and realizes its next-hop is EBBR (B).

A.3.  Inter-area support

   If each area has its own BIER sub-domain, the above procedure for
   post-SPF could identify one of the ABRs and the EBBR.  If a sub-
   domain spans multiple areas, then additional procedures as described
   in A.2 is needed.

A.3.1.  Inter-area Route summarization

   In a multi-area topology, a BIER sub-domain can span a single area.
   Suppose this single area is constructed entirely of BIER capable
   routers and the ABRs are the BIER Boundary Routers attaching the BIER
   sub-domain in this area to PIM domains in adjacent areas.  These BBRs
   can summarize the PIM domain routes via summary routes, as an example
   for OSPF, a type 3 summary LSAs can be used to advertise summary
   routes from a PIM domain area to the BIER area.  In such scenarios
   the IBBR can be configured to look up the Source via IGP database and
   use the summary routes and its Advertising Router field to resolve
   the EBBR.  The IBBR needs to ensure that the IGP summary route is
   generated by a BFR.  This can be achieved by ensuring that BIER Sub-
   TLV exists for this route.  If multiple BBRs (ABRs) have generated
   the same summary route the lowest Advertising Router IP can be
   selected or a vendor specific hashing algorithm can select the
   summary route from one of the BBRs.
