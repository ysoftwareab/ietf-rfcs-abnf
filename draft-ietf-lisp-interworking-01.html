<h1><br />Interworking LISP with IPv4 and IPv6<br />draft-ietf-lisp-interworking-01.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
     This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the
     Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate with Internet
     sites (which may be using either IPv4, IPv6, or both) but which are
     not running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP speaking
     sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather
     than traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields
     of all traffic they emit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically
     identical to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, normally routes to them are not carried
     in the global routing system so an interoperability mechanism is
     needed for non-LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with
     LISP-speaking sites.  This document introduces three such mechanisms.
     The first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers
     (PITR) (Section 5) to act as a intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel
     Router (ITR) for non-LISP-speaking hosts. Second the document adds
     Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality to LISP Ingress
     and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (xTRs) to substitute routable IP
     addresses for non-routable EIDs.  Finally, this document
     introduces a Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (PETR) to handle cases where a
     LISP ITR cannot send packets to non-LISP sites without encapsulation.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
      This document describes interoperation between LISP
      <a class='info' href='#LISP'>[LISP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> sites which use non-globally-routed EIDs, and non-LISP
      sites. The first is the use of Proxy Ingress Tunnel router (PITRs), which
      originate highly-aggregated routes to EID prefixes for non-LISP sites
      to use. It also describes the use of NAT by LISP ITRs when sending
      packets to non-LISP hosts.  Finally, it describes Proxy Egress Tunnel
      routers (PETRs) LISP for sites relying on PITRs, and which are faced
      with certain restrictions.
      
</p>
<p> 
      A key behavior of the separation of Locators and End-Point-IDs is that
      EID prefixes are normally not advertised into the Internet's Default Free
      Zone (DFZ).  Specifically, only RLOCs are carried in the Internet's
      DFZ.  Existing Internet sites (and their hosts) which do not
      run in the LISP protocol must still be able to reach sites numbered
      from LISP EID space.  This draft describes three mechanisms
      that can be used to provide reachability between sites
      that are LISP-capable and those that are not.  
      
</p>
<p> The first mechanism uses a new network element,
      the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (PITR) to act as a
      intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP-speaking
      hosts. The second mechanism adds a form of Network Address Translation
      (NAT) functionality to Tunnel Routers (xTRs), to substitute routable
      IP addresses for non-routable EIDs.  The final network element is
      the LISP Proxy Egress Tunnel Routers (PETR), which act as an 
      intermediate Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) for LISP sites which need to
      encapsulate packets LISP packets destined to non-LISP sites. 
      
</p>
<p>
       More detailed descriptions of these mechanisms and the network elements
       involved may be found in the following sections:
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 2 describes the different cases where interworking mechanisms
       are needed
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 3 defines terms used throughout the document
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 4 describes the relationship between the new EID prefix space
       and the IP address space used by the current Internet
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 5 introduces and describes the operation of Proxy-ITRs
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 6 defines how NAT is used by ETRs to translate non-routable
       EIDs into routable IP addresses.
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 7 introduces and describes the operations of Proxy-ETRs
      
</p>
<p>
     - Section 8 describes the relationship between asymmetric and
       Symmetric interworking mechanisms (Proxy-ITRs and Proxy-ETRs vs LISP-NAT)
      
</p>
<p>
        Note that any successful interworking model should be independent of
       any particular EID-to-RLOC mapping algorithm.  This document does not
       comment on the value of any of the particular LISP mapping systems.

LISP Interworking Models</h3>

<p>
        There are 4 unicast connectivity cases which describe how sites 
        can send packets to each other:
      
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li> Non-LISP site to Non-LISP site
</li>
<li> LISP site to LISP site
</li>
<li> LISP site to Non-LISP site
</li>
<li> Non-LISP site to LISP site
</li>
</ol>

<p>
         Note that while Cases 3 and 4 seem similar, there are subtle
        differences due to the way packets are originated.
      
</p>
<p>
         The first case is the Internet as we know it today and as such will
        not be discussed further here.  The second case is documented in
        [LISP] and there are no new interworking requirements because
        there are no new protocol requirements placed on intermediate non-
        LISP routers.
       
</p>
<p>
        In case 3, LISP site to Non-LISP site, a LISP site can (in most cases)
        send packets
        to a non-LISP site because the non-LISP site prefixes are routable.
        The non-LISP site need not do anything new to receive packets.  The
        only action the LISP site needs (with two possible caveats
        introduced below) to take is to know when not to LISP-encapsulate 
        packets. This can be achieved by using one of two mechanisms:
       
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
         At the ITR in the source site, if the destination of an IP packet
         is found to match a prefix from the BGP routing table, then the
         site is directly reachable by the BGP core that exists and
         operates today.
        
</li>
<li>
         Second, if (from the perspective of the ITR at the source site)
         the destination address of an IP address is not found in the EID-
         to-RLOC mapping database, the ITR could infer that it is not a
         LISP-capable site, and decide to not LISP-encapsulate the packet.
        
</li>
<li>
         In either of the  two exceptions mentioned above there
         could be some situations where (unencapsualted) packets originated
         by a LISP site may not be forwarded to a non-LISP site.  These cases
         are reviewed in section 7, (Proxy-Egress Tunnel Routers).  
        
</li>
</ol>

<p>
       Case 4, typically the most challenging, occurs when a host at a non-LISP 
       site wishes to send traffic to a host at a LISP site.  If the source
       host uses a (non-globally-routable) EID as the destination IP address,
       the packet is forwarded inside the source site until it reaches a
       router which cannot forward tin (due to lack of a default route),
       at which point the traffic is dropped.  For traffic not to be dropped,
       either some some mechanism to make this destination EID routable must
       be in place. Section 5 (PITRs) and Section 6 (LISP-NAT) describe two
       such mechanisms.
      
</p>
<p> 
       Case 4 also applies to packets returning to the LISP site, in Case 3.

           (most inner) IP header of a packet.  The host obtains a
           destination EID the same way it obtains an destination address
           today, for example through a DNS lookup or SIP exchange.  The
           source EID is obtained via existing mechanisms used to set a
           host's "local" IP address.  An EID is allocated to a host from an
           EID-prefix block associated with the site where the host is
           located.  An EID can be used by a host to refer to other hosts.
           EIDs MUST NOT be used as LISP RLOCs.  Note that EID blocks may be
           assigned in a hierarchical manner, independent of the network
           topology, to facilitate scaling of the mapping database.  In
           addition, an EID block assigned to a site may have site-local
           structure (subnetting) for routing within the site; this structure
           is not visible to the global routing system.  When used in
           discussions with other Locator/ID separation proposals, a LISP EID

Routable EIDs</h3>

<p>
        An obvious way to achieve interworking between LISP and non-LISP
       hosts is for a LISP site to simply announce EID prefixes into the DFZ, much like
       the current routing system, effectively treating them as "Provider Independent (PI)"
       prefixes. Having a site do this is undesirable as it defeats one of the primary
       goals of LISP - to reduce global routing system state.

Impact on Routing Table</h3>

<p>
       If EID prefixes are announced into the DFZ, the impact is similar to
       the case in which LISP has not been deployed, because these EID
       prefixes will be no more aggregatable than existing PI addressing.
       Such a mechanism is not viewed as a viable long term solution, but may
       be a viable short term way for a site to transition a portion of its 
       address space to EID space without changing its existing routing policy.

Use of Routable EIDs for sites transitioning to LISP</h3>

<p>      
            A primary design goal for LISP (and other Locator/ID separation proposals)
            is to facilitate topological aggregation of namespace used by the path
            computation, and, thus, decrease global routing system overhead.
            Another goal is to achieve the benefits of improved aggregation as
            soon as possible.  Individual sites advertising
            their own routes for LISP EID prefixes into the global routing system
            is therefore not recommended. 
            
</p>
<p>
            That being said, single homed sites (or multi-homed sites that are
            not leaking more specific exceptions) and that are already using
            provider-aggregated prefixes can use these prefixes as LISP EIDs
       	    without adding state to the routing system.  In other words, such 
       	    sites do not cause additional prefixes to be advertised.  For such
       	    sites, connectivity to a non-LISP sites does not require
       	    interworking machinery because the "PA" EIDs are already routable
 	    (they are effectively LISP-R type sites).  Their EIDs are found
  	    in the LISP mapping system, and their (aggregate) PA prefix(es)
   	    are found in the DFZ Internet.
  	    
</p>
<p>  
  	     The continued announcements of an existing site's Provider
  	     Independent (or "PI") prefix(es) is of course under control of that site.
	     Some period of transition, where a site is is found both in the LISP
             mapping system, and as a discrete prefix in the Internet routing system, may
	     be a viable transition strategy.  Care should be taken not to advertise 
             additional more specific LISP EID prefixes into the DFZ.

Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers</h3>

<p>
       Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers (PITRs) allow for non-LISP sites to send packets
       to LISP-NR sites.  A PITR is a new network element that shares many
       characteristics with the LISP ITR.  PITRs allow non-LISP sites to send
       packets to LISP-NR sites without any changes to protocols or equipment
       at the non-LISP site.  PITRs have two primary functions:
      
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>

PITR EID announcements</h3>

<p>
         A key part of PITR functionality is to advertise routes for highly-
         aggregated EID prefixes into part of the global routing system.
         Aggressive aggregation is performed to minimize the number of new
         announced routes. In addition, careful placement of PITRs can greatly
         reduce the advertised scope of these new routes. To this end, PITRs should be
         deployed close to non-LISP-speaking rather than close to LISP sites.
         Such deployment not only limits the scope of EID-prefix route
         advertisements, it also also allows traffic forwarding load to be spread
         among many PITRs.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Packet Flow with PITRs</h3>

<p>
        What follows is an example of the path a packet would take when using a
        PITR.  In this example, the LISP-NR site is given the EID prefix
        240.0.0.0/24.  For the purposes of this example, this prefix and no
        covering aggregate is present in the global routing system. 
        In other words, without the Proxy-ITR announcing 240.0.0.0/24,
        a packet with this destination were to reach a router in the
        "Default Free Zone", it would be dropped. 
       
</p>
<p>
         A full protocol exchange example follows:
       
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The source host makes a DNS lookup EID for destination, and gets
          240.1.1.1 in return.
</li>
<li>The source host has a default route to customer Edge (CE) router and
           forwards the packet to the CE.
</li>
<li>The CE has a default route to its Provider Edge (PE)
           router, and forwards the packet to the PE.
</li>
<li>The PE has route to 240.0.0.0/24 and the next hop is the PITR.
</li>
<li>The PITR has or acquires a mapping for 240.1.1.1 and LISP encapsulates the
           packet.  The outer IP header now has a destination address of one of the
           destination EID's RLOCs.  The outer source address of this encapsulated
           packet is the PITR's RLOC.
</li>
<li>The PITR looks up the RLOC, and forwards LISP packet to the next hop, 
           after which, it is forwarded by other routers to the ETR's RLOC.
</li>
<li>The ETR decapsulates the packet and delivers the packet to the
           240.1.1.1 host in the destination LISP site.
</li>
<li>Packets from host 240.1.1.1 will flow back through the LISP
           site's ITR. Such packets are not encapsulated because the ITR knows
           that the destination (the original source) is a non-LISP site.
           The ITR knows this because it can check the LISP mapping database
           for the destination EID, and on a failure determine that the
           destination site is not LISP enabled.
</li>
<li>
           Packets are then routed natively and directly to the destination 
           (original source) site.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
        Note that in this example the return path is
        asymmetric, so return traffic will not go back through
        the PITR.  This is because the LISP-NR site's ITR will
        discover that the originating site is not a LISP site,
        and not encapsulate the returning packet (see <a class='info' href='#LISP'>[LISP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> for details of ITR behavior).
       
</p>
<p>
        The asymmetric nature of traffic flows allows the PITR to be
        relatively simple - it will only have to encapsulate LISP packets.

Scaling PITRs</h3>

<p>
         PITRs attract traffic by announcing the LISP EID namespace into parts of
         the non-LISP-speaking global routing system.  There are several ways that
         a network could control how traffic reaches a particular PITR to prevent
         it from receiving more traffic than it can handle:
        
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
          The PITR's aggregate routes might be selectively announced,
          giving a coarse way to control the quantity of traffic attracted by
          that PITR.  For example, some of the routes being announced might be
          tagged with a BGP community and their scope of announcement limited 
          by the routing policy of the provider.
          
</li>
<li>
           The same address might be announced by multiple PITRs in
           order to share the traffic using IP Anycast.  The asymmetric nature
           of traffic flows through the Proxy ITR means that operationally, 
           deploying a set PITRs would be very similar to existing Anycasted
           services like DNS caches.  Multiple Proxy ITRs could advertise the same
           BGP Next Hop IP address as their RLOC, and traffic would be attracted
           to the nearest Next Hop according to the the network's IGP.

Impact of the PITRs placement in the network</h3>

<p>
         There are several approaches that a network could take in placing
         PITRs.  Placing the PITR near the source of traffic allows for the
         communication between the non-LISP site and the LISP site to have the
         least "stretch" (i.e. the least number of forwarding hops when compared
         to an optimal path between the sites).
         
</p>
<p>
         Some proposals, for example CRIO <a class='info' href='#CRIO'>[CRIO]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zhang, X., Francis, P., Wang, J., and K. Yoshida, &ldquo;CRIO:Scaling IP Routing with the Core 	  Router-Integrated Overlay,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>,
         have suggested grouping PITRs near an arbitrary subset of
         ETRs and announcing a 'local' subset of EID space.  This
         model cannot guarantee minimum stretch if the EID prefix
         route advertisement points are changed (such a change
         might occur if a site adds, removes, or replaces one or
         more of its ISP connections).

<a name="rfc.section.5.5"></a><h3>5.5.&nbsp;
Benefit to Networks Deploying PITRs</h3>

<p>  
         When packets destined for LISP-NR sites arrive and are encapsulated at
         a Proxy-ITR, a new LISP packet header is pre-pended. This causes the packet's
         destination to be set to the destination ETRs RLOC.  Because packets are
         thus routed towards RLOCs, it can potentially better follow the
         Proxy-ITR network's traffic engineering policies (such as closest exit
         routing).  This also means that providers which are not default-free
         and do not deploy Proxy-ITRs end up sending more traffic to expensive
         transit links (assuming their upstreams have deployed Proxy-ITRs) 
         rather than to the ETR's RLOC addresses, to which they may well have cheaper
         and closer connectivity to (via, for example, settlement-free peering). 
         A corollary to this would be that large transit providers, deploying PITRs
         may attract more traffic, and therefore more revenue, from their customers.

       form of NAT <a class='info' href='#RFC2993'>[RFC2993]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hain, T., &ldquo;Architectural Implications of NAT,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. LISP-NAT is designed to
       enable the interworking of non-LISP sites and LISP-NR sites by
       ensuring that the LISP-NR's site addresses are always routable. 
       LISP-NAT accomplishes this by translating a host's source address
       from an 'inner' (LISP-NR EID) value to an 'outer' (LISP-R) value
       and keeping this translation in a table that it can reference
       for subsequent packets.
      
</p>
<p>
        In addition, existing RFC 1918 <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> sites
        can use LISP-NAT to talk to both LISP or non-LISP sites. 
      
</p>
<p>
        The basic concept of LISP-NAT is that when transmitting a
	packet, the ITR replaces a non-routable EID source
	address with a routable source address, which enables
	packets to return to the site. 
       
</p>
<p>
        There are two main cases that involve LISP-NAT:
       
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
         Hosts at LISP sites that use non-routable global EIDs
	 speaking to non-LISP sites using global addresses.
        
</li>
<li>
         Hosts at LISP sites that use RFC 1918 private EIDs
	 speaking to other sites, who may be either LISP or
	 non-LISP.
       
</li>
</ol>

<p>
        Note that LISP-NAT is not needed in the case of LISP-R
        (routable global EIDs) sources. This case occurs when
        a site is announcing its prefix into both the LISP mapping
        system as well as the Internet DFZ.  This is because the
        LISP-R source's address is routable, and return packets
        will be able to natively reach the site.

Using LISP-NAT with LISP-NR EIDs</h3>

<p>
        LISP-NAT allows a host with a LISP-NR EID to send packets to
        non-LISP hosts by translating the LISP-NR EID to a globally
        unique address (a LISP-R EID). This globally unique address
        may be a either a PI or PA address.
        
</p>
<p>
         An example of this translation follows.  For this
	 example, a site has been assigned a LISP-NR EID of
	 220.1.1.0/24.  In order to utilize LISP-NAT, the site has
	 also been provided the PA EID of 128.200.1.0/24, and uses
	 the first address (128.200.1.1) as the site's RLOC.  The
	 rest of this PA space (128.200.1.2 to 128.200.1.254) is
	 used as a translation pool for this site's hosts who need
	 to send packets to non-LISP hosts.
	
</p>
<p>
         The translation table might look like the following: 
         
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="translation-table"></a>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        Site NR-EID    Site R-EID      Site's RLOC    Translation Pool
        ==============================================================
        220.1.1.0/24   128.200.1.0/24  128.200.1.1    128.200.1.2-254
</pre></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;1: Example Translation Table&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>
        The Host 220.1.1.2 sends a packet destined for a non-LISP
	site to its default route (the ITR).  The ITR receives
	the packet, and determines that the destination is not a
	LISP site.  How the ITR makes this determination is up to
	the ITRs implementation of the EID-to-RLOC mapping system
	used (see, for example <a class='info' href='#LISP-ALT'>[LISP&#8209;ALT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+ALT),&rdquo; Febuary&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>).
	
</p>
<p>
        The ITR then rewrites the source address of the packet
	from 220.1.1.2 to 128.200.1.2, which is the first
	available address in the LISP-R EID space available to
	it.  The ITR keeps this translation in a table in order
	to reverse this process when receiving packets destined
	to 128.200.1.2.
	
</p>
<p>
         Finally, when the ITR forwards this packet without
	 encapsulating it, it uses the entry in its LISP-NAT table
	 to translate the returning packets' destination IPs to
	 the proper host.

<p>
      In the case where hosts using RFC 1918 addresses desire to
	 send packets to non-LISP hosts, the LISP-NAT
	 implementation acts much like an existing IPv4 NAT

	 LISP-R EIDs for its global address pool as well as
         providing all the standard NAT functions required today.
	
</p>
<p>
      The source of the packet must be translated to a LISP-R
	 EID in a manner similar to <a class='info' href='#lispnat'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>LISP-NAT</span><span>)</span></a>, and

LISP Sites with Hosts using RFC 1918 Addresses  
                      Sending Packets to Other LISP Sites</h3>

<p>
         LISP-NAT allows a host with an RFC 1918 address to
	 send packets to LISP hosts by translating the RFC 1918
	 address to a LISP EID.  After translation, the
	 communication between source and destination ITR and ETRs
	 continues as described in <a class='info' href='#LISP'>[LISP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Meyer, D., and D. Lewis, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
	
</p>
<p>
         An example of this translation and encapsulation follows.  For this
         example, a host has been assigned a RFC 1918 address of 192.168.1.2.
         In order to utilize LISP-NAT, the site also has been provided the
         LISP-R EID prefix of 192.0.2.0/24, and uses the first address
         (192.0.2.1) as the site's RLOC.  The rest of this PA space
         (192.0.2.2 to 192.0.2.254) is used as a translation pool for this
         site's hosts who need to send packets to both non-LISP and LISP
         hosts.
        
</p>
<p>
         The Host 192.168.1.2 sends a packet destined for a non-LISP site to
         its default route (the ITR).  The ITR receives the packet and
         determines that the destination is a LISP site.  How the ITR makes
         this determination is up to the ITRs implementation of the EID/RLOC
         mapping system. 
	
</p>
<p>
         The ITR then rewrites the source address of the packet from
         192.168.1.2 to 192.0.2.2, which is the first available address in
         the LISP EID space available to it.  The ITR keeps this translation
         in a table in order to reverse this process when receiving packets
         destined to 192.0.2.2.
	
</p>
<p>
         The ITR then LISP encapsulates this packet (see [LISP] for details).
         The ITR uses the site's RLOC as the LISP outer header's source and
         the translation address as the LISP inner header's source.  Once it
         decapsulates returning traffic, it uses the entry in its LISP-NAT
         table to translate the returning packet's destination IP address and
         then forward to the proper host.

LISP-NAT and multiple EIDs</h3>

<p>
         When a site has two addresses that a host might use for

	 DNS use the LISP-R EID or the LISP-NR EID.  This problem
	 exists for NAT in general, but the specific issue
	 described above is unique to LISP. Using PITRs can

When LISP-NAT and PITRs used by the same LISP Site</h3>

<p>
        With LISP-NAT, there are two EIDs possible for a given host, the
       LISP-R EID and the LISP-NR EID.  When a site has two addresses that a
       host might use for global reachability, name-to-address directories
       may need to be modified.
      
</p>
<p>
       This problem, global addressability, exists for NAT in general, but
       the specific issue described above is unique to location/identity
       separation schemes.  Some of these have suggested running a separate DNS
       instance for new types of EIDs.  This solves the problem but
       introduces complexity for the site.  Alternatively, using PITRs can
       mitigate this problem, because the LISP-NR EID can be reached in all
       cases.

Proxy Egress Tunnel Routers</h3>

<p>
      Proxy Egress Tunnel Routers (PETRs) allow for LISP sites to send packets
      to non-LISP sites in the case where the access network does not allow
      for the LISP site send packets with the source address of the site's EID(s).
      A PETR is a new network element that, conceptually, acts as an ETR
      for traffic destined to non-LISP sites. This also has the effect of
      allowing an ITR avoid having to decide whether to encapsulate packets
      or not - it can always encapsulate packets.  An ITR would
      encapsulate packets destined for LISP sites (no change here) and
      these would be routed directly to the corespondent site's ETR.
      All other packets (those destined to non-LISP sites) will be sent to
      the originating site's PETR.   
     
</p>
<p>
     There are two primary reasons why sites would want to utilize a PETR:
     
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Avoiding strict uRPF failures:</dt>
<dd>
         Some provider's access networks require the source of the packets

         (see section 9)
        
</dd>
<dt>Traversing a different IP Protocol:</dt>
<dd>
         A LISP site may want to transmit packets to a non-LISP site where the some of the
         intermediate network does not support the particular IP protocol desired
         (v4 or v6).  PETRs can allow this LISP site's data to 'hop over' this by
         utilizing LISP's support for mixed protocol encapsulation.

Packet Flow with Proxy Egress Tunnel Routers</h3>

<p>
      Packets from a LISP site can reach a non-LISP site with the aid of
      a Proxy-ETR (or PETR).  An ITR is simply configured to send all
      non-LISP traffic, which it normally would have forwarded natively
      (non-encapsulated), to a PETR.  In the case where the ITR uses the
      Map-Resolver interface the ITR will encapsulate packets that match its Negative
      Map-Cache to the configured Proxy-ETR(s).  In the case where the ITR is connected
      to the mapping system directly it would encapsulate all packets to the configured
      Proxy-ETR that are cache misses.  Note that this outer encapsulation
      to the Proxy-ETR may be in an IP protocol other than the (inner) encapsulated data.
      Routers then use the LISP (outer) header's destination address to route the
      packets toward the configured Proxy-ETR.
     
</p>
<p>
      A PETR should verify the (inner) source EID of the packet at
      time of decapsulation in order to verify that this is from a
      configured LISP site.  This is to prevent spoofed inner sources
      from being encapsulated through the Proxy-ETR.
     
</p>
<p>
      What follows is an example of the path a packet would take when using
      a PETR.  In this example, the LISP-NR (or LISP-R) site is given the EID prefix
      240.2.0.0/24, and it is trying to reach host at a non-LISP site with the
      IP prefix of 192.0.2.0/24.  For the purposes of this example, the destination 
      is a non-LISP site and 192.0.2.0/24 is found in the Internet's routing system.
      
</p>
<p>
       A full protocol exchange example follows:
      
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The source host makes a DNS lookup for the destination, and gets
         192.0.2.100 (a host in a non-LISP site) in return. 
</li>
<li>The source host has a default route to customer Edge (CE) router and
         forwards the packet towards the CE.
</li>
<li>The CE is a LISP ITR, and is configured to encapsulate traffic
         destined for non-LISP sites to a Proxy-ETR.
</li>
<li>The Proxy ETR decapsulates the LISP packet and forwards the original
         packet to its next hop.
</li>
<li>The packet is then routed natively and directly to the destination
        (non-LISP) site 192.0.2.0/24.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
       Note that in this example the return path is asymmetric, so return
       traffic will not go back through the Proxy-ETR.  This means that 
       in order to reach LISP-NR sites, non-LISP sites must still use Proxy ITRs.

Discussion of Proxy ITRs (PITRs), LISP-NAT, and Proxy-ETRs (PETRs)</h3>

<p>
      In summary, there are three mechanisms for interworking LISP with non-LISP
      Sites (for both IPv4 and IPv6).  In the LISP-NAT option the LISP site
      can manage and control the interworking on its own.  In the PITR case, we
      the site is not required to manage the advertisement of it's EID prefix into
      the DFZ,  with the cost of potentially adding stretch to the connections of
      non-LISP sites sending packets to the LISP site.  The third option is Proxy-ETRs, 
      which are optionally used by sites relying on PITRs case to mitigate
      two caveats for LISP sites sending packets to non-LISP sites.  This means
      Proxy-ETRs are not usually expected to be deployed by themselves, rather
      they will be used to assist LISP-NR sites which are already using PITRs.

How Proxy-ITRs and Proxy-ETRs Interact</h3>

<p>
      There is a subtle difference between Symmetrical (LISP-NAT) vs Asymmetrical
      (Proxy-ITR and Proxy-ETR) Interworking techniques.  Operationally,
      Proxy-ITRs (PITRs) and Proxy-ETRs (PETRs) can (and likely should) be
      decoupled since Proxy-ITRs are best deployed closest to non-LISP sites,
      and Proxy-ETRs are best located close to the LISP sites they are
      decapsulating for.  This asymmetric placement of the two
      network elements minimizes the stretch imposed on each direction of the
      packet flow, while still allowing for coarsely aggregated
      announcements of EIDs into the Internet's routing table.

<a name="rfc.section.9"></a><h3>9.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
       Like any router or LISP ITR, PITRs will have the opportunity to inspect traffic
       at the time that they encapsulate.  The location of these devices in
       the network can have implications for discarding malicious traffic
       on behalf of ETRs which request this behavior (via the drop action bit
       in Map-Reply packets for an EID or EID prefix).
      
</p>
<p>
       As with traditional NAT, LISP-NAT will obscure the actual host
       LISP-NR EID behind the LISP-R addresses used as the NAT pool.  
      
</p>
<p>
       When LISP sites send packets to non-LISP sites (these non-LISP sites rely
       on PITRs to enable Interworking), packets will have the Site's EID as
       its source IP address.  These EIDs may not be recognized by their
       Internet Service Provider's Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)
       rules enabled on the Provider Edge Router.  Several options are
       available to the service provider.  For example they could enable a
       less strict version of uRPF, where they only look for the existence
       of the the EID prefix in the routing table.  Another, more secure,
       option is to add a static route for the customer on the PE router,
       but not redistribute this route into the provider's routing table.
       Finally, Proxy-ETRs can enable LISP sites to bypass this uRPF check
       by encapsulating all of their egressing traffic destined to non-LISP
       sites to the Proxy-ETR (thus ensuring the outer IP source address
       is the site's RLOC).
