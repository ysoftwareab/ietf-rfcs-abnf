1.  Introduction

   This document defines a mechanism called "RPKI validated cache Update
   in SLURM [RFC 8416] over HTTPs (RUSH)", for the use of SLURM in
   updating RPKI cache data over HTTP [RFC7540] using HTTPs [RFC2818]
   URIs (and therefore TLS [RFC8446] security for integrity and
   confidentiality).  Integration with HTTP provides a secure transport
   for distributing cache data, which is in alignment with SLURM file
   format in order to take advantage of using one same API for a cache
   server to do both remote update and local override.

   The RPKI validated cache in this document refers to the validated
   data of assertion information certified by corresponding RPKI signed
   objects such as ROA [RFC6482] and BGPsec router certificate
   [RFC8209], which are transferred from the RPKI cache server to
   routers by RTR protocol [RFC8210] for the use of the RPKI.  SLURM
   offers a standardized method for describing RPKI cache data in JSON
   format [RFC8259], and SLURM is designed to carry out incremental
   update.

   Note that RUSH merely focuses on a standardized transport and data
   format of the RPKI cache data.  RUSH has nothing to do with
   synchronization at the RUSH end system, that is, more sophisticated
   functions such as automatic re-synchronization and access control is
   out of this scope and MAY be left to private implementation.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT","REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  RUSH Usecase

   o Cache Distribution
   RUSH can be used to distribute a RPKI validated cache within a single
   ASN or network, for example a confederation composed of a number of
   ASes.  A small site or enterprise network MAY also use RUSH by
   synchronizing with a third-party RPKI cache provider over external
   networks.

   o Local Control over Networks
   Network operators MAY want to inject SLURM Assertions/Filters via an
   API offered by RPKI validator/cache.  RUSH is therefore able to carry
   out such local control signals inside an administrative bailiwick in
   a secure manner.

   o AS0 SLURM File Delivery
   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) need to publish assertions
   with origin AS0 ([RFC6491]) for all the unallocated and unassigned
   address space (IPv4 and IPv6) for which it is the current
   administrator.  RUSH is able to deliver those assertions to RPKI
   relying parties if so called AS0 SLURM file are generated by the RIR.

   To summarize, RUSH MUST be used in scenarios where the authenticity
   of SLURM files can be assured when carried over multiple
   administrative domains.  Alternatively, RUSH SHOULD be used inside an
   administrative domain to provide extra security by the virtue of pre-
   configured trust anchors.

4.  RUSH Operations

4.1.  Use of SLURM

   RUSH uses SLURM file format to indicate the intended update.  A SLURM
   file consists of a single JSON object containing some members.  Among
   others, "validationOutputFilters" [Section 3.3 of [RFC8416]] and
   "locallyAddedAssertions" [Section 3.4 of [RFC8416]] are defined to
   describe actions of deleting some of existing data items and adding
   new data items respectively.

   Note that RUSH re-uses the JSON members of SLURM object, not implying
   the very actions are taken locally to any extent.  Typically, RUSH
   takes place over networks remotely while take effects to the cache in
   question locally.

   The RUSH-aware HTTP server/client MUST be prepared to parse SLURM
   object.

4.2.  Use of HTTP as Transport

   HTTP is employed by RUSH to transfer RPKI validated cache update
   information as expressed as a SLURM object.  A new data type is
   therefore defined to identify SLURM object in HTTP message body.

   The RUSH-aware HTTP server/client MUST be prepared to process media
   type "application/json-slurm".

4.3.  RUSH Example

   Figure 1 shows an example of using RUSH to carry out RPKI validated
   cache by HTTP POST method.

6.  Security Considerations

   Note that RPKI offers signed-object-oriented security, which is not
   provide by RUSH any longer.  There are some security issues must be
   handled properly as per different usecases as described in Section 3.

   Cache Identity: RUSH is designed to carry out RPKI cache data update
   from one to another, with out-of-band trust established between those
   cache servers.  That is, the scope of RUSH usage is convergent.
   Cache subscription management might be employed to implement cache
   identification and verification.  The RPKI cache server security and
   the trust model for the interaction between cache servers is out of
   the scope of this document.

   Transport Security: Updating RPKI validated cache over HTTPs relies
   on the security of the underlying HTTP transport.  Implementations
   utilizing HTTP/2 benefit from the TLS profile defined in Section 9.2
   of [RFC7540].

   Data Integrity: An HTTPS connection provides transport security for
   the interaction between cache servers, but it does not provide data
   integrity detection.  An adversary that can control the cache used by
   the subscriber can affect that subscriber's view of the RPKI.
