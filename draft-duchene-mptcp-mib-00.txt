1.  Introduction

   Multipath TCP is an extension to TCP [RFC0793] that was specified in
   [RFC6824].  Multipath TCP allows hosts to use multiple paths to send
   and receive the data belonging to one connection.  For this, a
   Multipath TCP is composed of several TCP connections that are called
   subflows.

   This memo proposes a simple Management Information Base (MIB) that
   gathers statistics and counters about the operation of a Multipath
   TCP implementation.  They are designed to give a better understanding
   of Multipath TCP operations.  In particular, the MIB covers the
   different failure conditions that might occur and would trigger a
   fallback to regular TCP of the MPTCP connection or the failure of a
   subflow.  These failures have important operational implications.
   Further, several counters are defined to track the transmission and
   reception of data at the MPTCP-layer.  These counters might help to
   understand the performance of MPTCP.

3.  IANA considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

Internet-Draft                  MPTCP MIB                   October 2015


         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ------------      -----------------------
         mptcp             { mib-2 TBD}

   RFC Editor: The IANA is requested to assign a value for "TBD" under
   the 'mib-2' subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers
   registry.  When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked
   to replace "TBD" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value
   and to remove this note.

4.  Conclusion

   This document has proposed a simple Management Information Base (MIB)
   to manage Multipath TCP.
