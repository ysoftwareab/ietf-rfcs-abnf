Abstract


   This memo is an extension to the SNMP MIB.  It specifies an IAB
   standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests
   discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This memo extends
   the MIB defined in [BGP-MIB].


   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please forward comments to
   idr@merit.net.




1. Introduction


   This memo defines extensions to the MIB defined in [BGP-MIB].  In
   particular, it describes managed objects based upon attributes defined
   in "BGP Route Reflective - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP" [RFC2796].


2. Overview


   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation
   that supports Route Reflection [RFC2796].

   This MIB defines a system-wide scalar object, and extends two tables
   defined in [BGP-MIB]:  the BGP Peer Table, and the BGP-4 Received
   Path Attribute Table.

    - bgpClusterId { bgp 11 1 }

      The locally configured Cluster-ID.

    - bgpPeerReflectTable { bgp 11 2 }

      This table maintains information on whether each peer is configured
      as a reflector client of this router.

    - bgp4ReflectTable { bgp 11 3 }

      This table maintains information about the Route Reflection specific
      path attributes (Cluster List and Originator-ID) received with routes.
