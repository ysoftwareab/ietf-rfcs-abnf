                                  Abstract


     This  document describes a possible structure of the media content
    for audio  and video  for Internet applications.    The definitions
    are independent  of the particular  transport mechanism used.   The
    descriptions  provide  pointers  to reference  implementations  and
    the  detailed  standards.     This  document is  meant  as  an  aid
    for implementors  of audio,  video  and other  real-time multimedia
    applications.

1.1 Encoding-independent recommendations


The  following  recommendations  are  default  operating  parameters.     An
applications should  be  prepared  to  handle other  values.     The  ranges
given  are  meant  to  give  guidance   to  application  writers,   allowing
a set  of  applications  conforming  to  these  guidelines  to  interoperate
without additional  negotiation.    These  guidelines are  not  intended  to
restrict operating parameters for  application that can  negotiate a set  of
interoperable parameters, e.g., through a conference control protocol.

For packetized  audio,  the default  packetization  interval should  have  a
duration of 20 ms,  unless otherwise noted  in Table 1.   The  packetization
interval determines the minimum end-to-end  delay; longer packets  introduce
less header overhead but higher delay and make packet loss more  noticeable.
For on-interactive  applications  such  as lectures  or  links  with  severe
bandwidth constraints, a higher packetization delay may be appropriate.  For
frame-based encodings (marked as F in the  table 1 below) such as LPC,  CELP
and GSM, the  sender may choose  to combine several  frame intervals into  a
single message to reduce header  overhead.  The  number of frames is  single
packetization interval,  however, a  sender may  choose  to combine  several
intervals into a single message.  The receiver can tell the number of frames
contained in a message since the  nominal frame duration is defined as  part
of the encoding.

If multiple channels are used, the left channel information always  precedes
the right-channel information.  For  more than two channels, the  convention
followed by the  AIFF-C audio  interchange format should  be followed.    It
is listed in the  table below.   (The AIFF-C  specification is available  by
anonymous ftp at sgi.sgi.com in the file sgi/aiff-c.9.26.91.ps.)

The sampling frequency should be drawn from the set:  8, 11.025, 16,  22.05,
44.1 and 48 kHz.  Preferred rates are 8, 16 and 48 kHz.

1.2 Recommended Audio Encodings


The table 1 shows the names, types (sample vs.  frame oriented) and  default
sampling frequencies  of  recommended encodings.    The  list  is  partially
drawn from  the  document  ``Recommended  practices  for  enhancing  digital
audio compatibility in  multimedia systems'', published  by the  Interactive
Multimedia Assocation,  Version 3.00,  Oct.    1992 (referenced  as  [IMA]).
The names are  for identification only;  they correspond  to the names  used
within the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). Other applications may choose
different namings.

                         Table 1:  Audio encodings

For multi-octet  encodings, octets  are transmitted  in network  byte  order
(i.e., most significant octet first).

A detailed description of  the encodings is  given below.   The names  shown
(L16, PCMU, etc.)   are limited to four characters  and suitable to be  used
for identification in protocols such as RTP (RFC TBD).


L16: denotes  uncompressed audio  data, using  16-bit signed  representation
    with 65535  equally divided  steps  between minimum  and maximum  signal
    level, ranging from -32768 to 32767.  The value is represented in two's
    complement notation.

PCMU: specified in  CCITT recommendation G.711.   Audio  data is encoded  as
    eight  bits per  sample, after  companding.    Code to  convert  between
    linear and mu-law companded data is available in the IMA document.

PCMA: specified in  CCITT recommendation G.711.   Audio  data is encoded  as
    eight  bits per  sample, after  companding.    Code to  convert  between
    linear and A-law companded data is available in the IMA document.

G721 through G729: specified  in  the corresponding  CCITT  recommendations.
    Reference implementations for G.721  and G.723 are available as part  of

DVI: is  specified in  the  ``Recommended  Practices for  Enhancing  Digital
    Audio  Compatibility   in  Multimedia   Systems'',   published  by   the
    Interactive Multimedia  Association (IMA), Annapolis,  MD. The  document
    also contains reference implementations for mu-law to 16-bit,  ADPCM and
    sample rate conversions.



For sample-based encodings,  a receiver should  accept packets  representing
between 0 and  200 ms of  audio data.(1)   Receivers should  be prepared  to
accept multi-channel audio, but may choose to only play a single channel.


1.3 Application Programming Interface for Audio Codecs


The application programming interface (API) for audio codecs described  here
is suggested, but not required for interoperability.  The API shown here  is
similar to the one used by SunOS 4.1.  The encoding types are drawn from the
standard names defined here.


typedef {AE_PCMU = 1, AE_PCMA, AE_L16} encoding_t;

typedef struct {
  unsigned sample_rate;            /* samples per second */
  unsigned samples_per_unit;       /* samples per unit */
  unsigned bytes_per_unit;         /* bytes per sample unit */
  unsigned channels;               /* # of interleaved channels */
  encoding_t encoding;             /* data encoding format */
  unsigned data_size;              /* length of data (optional) */
} audio_descr_t;

void *x_init(void *state, double period);

int x_encode(void *in_buf, int in_size, audio_descr_t *in_descr,
   void *out_buf, int *out_size, void *state);
int x_decode(void *in_buf, int in_size, audio_descr_t *out_descr,
   void *out_buf, int *out_size, void *state);

------------------------------
 1. This restriction allows reasonable buffer sizing for the receiver.

x_init initializes a particular instance  of a codec.  If the argument  state
is zero, a memory area  sufficient to hold the  encoder or decoder state  is
allocated; if that argument is non-zero, the existing area is reinitialized.
The function returns a  pointer to the  area, zero if  the state area  could
not be  allocated.    The argument  period refers  to  the amount  of  audio
data in each  block, measured in  seconds.   It is  typically only used  for
block-oriented codecs.

The generic pointer to state refers to an area of storage whose structure is
opaque to the application program.  In the functions, 'x' is replaced by the
appropriate codec name, appropriately modified to conform to C syntax (e.g.,
g711, g721, etc).

The encoder and  decoder transform the  data contained in  the input  buffer
in_buf (in_size bytes) and  deposit the  result into the  output buffer  area
out_buf.    The variable  out_size  is set  to the  number of  bytes  actually
contained in the output buffer.   The ah arguments points to a structure  of
type audio_hdr_t,  which defines the given  input data format for the  encoder
and the desired output data format for the decoder.  The functions return  0
on success, a negative number if a failure occurred.

All block-oriented audio codecs should be able to encode and decode  several
consecutive blocks.



2 Video


The following video encodings are defined, with their abbreviated names used
for identification:


Bolt: The encoding is  implemented by the Bolter video codec [ED: need  more
    info on company, designation].

JPEG: The encoding is  specified in ISO Standard TBD. The data is  formatted
    according to TBD.

H261: The  encoding is  specified in  ITU (formerly  CCITT) standard  H.261.
    The packetization and RTP-specific properties are described in RFC TBD.

nv: The encoding is implemented in the program 'nv' developed at  Xerox PARC
    by Ron Frederick.

CUSM: The  encoding is  implemented  in the  program CU-SeeMe  developed  at
    Cornell University  by  Dick Cogger,  Scott Brim,  Tim Dorcey  and  John
    Lynn.

dvc: The encoding is  implemented in the program PictureWindow developed  at
    Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN).
