1.  Introduction

   [RFC7432] describes protocols and procedures for BGP MPLS based
   Ethernet VPNs.  BGP is used for MAC learning by exchanging customer
   MAC routing information between PEs in the control plane instead of
   MAC learning between PEs in the data plane.  It also states that MAC
   learning between PEs and CEs MAY be done in the control plane, but it
   does not define the detailed protocols and procedures.  This document
   identifies the possible applications which can benefit from MAC
   learning through the control plane between PEs and CEs.  Then this
   document specifies protocols and procedures of using BGP as PE-CE
   control protocol for carrying customer MAC routing information.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology described in [RFC7432].

                 Figure 1 DCI Traffic Optimization

   In the reference model depicted by Figure 1, all WAN PE routers run
   BGP and are connected by a Controller.  For each GW, it multihoming
   connects to the WAN PEs, in this scenario, GW acts as an EVPN CE and
   WAN PE acts as an EVPN PE.

   1.  Requirements of outbound traffic control:

   Outbound traffic control adjusts the transmission paths of outbound
   traffic from the WAN network to ensure that the traffic is evenly
   shared among PEs/links between WAN PEs and NVO networks and the
   bandwidth usage of each PE/link is below the specified threshold.

   In outbound traffic control scenario, if the bandwidth usage of a
   link exceeds the specified threshold, the Controller automatically
   identifies which traffic needs to be scheduled and the Controller
   automatically calculates traffic control paths based on network
   topology and traffic information.

   For such requirements, if the MAC routing learning between PEs and
   CEs or can be done through the control plane, Controller can control
   the multiple paths to the same destination which are receiving from

   different GWs and decide which MAC route to be used for outbound
   traffic.

   2.  Requirements of Inbound traffic control:

   Inbound traffic control adjusts the transmission paths of traffic
   bound for the WAN network to ensure that the traffic is evenly shared
   among PEs/links between GWs and WAN PEs and the bandwidth usage of
   each PE/link is below the specified threshold.

   For such requirements, if the MAC routing learning between PEs and
   CEs or can be done through the control plane, the controller can
   control the path attributes of the EVPN MAC route that is advertised
   to the different GWs and steer the inbound traffic.

3.2.  Inter-AS EVPN Option-A Solution

   Currently, a typical connection mechanism between two EVPN networks
   can be similar to Inter-AS Option-A of [RFC4364].  In Option-A Inter-
   AS solution, peering ASBRs are connected by multiple sub-interfaces,
   each ASBR acts as a PE, and thinks that the other ASBR is a CE.  For
   tradition L3VPN, Inter-AS Option-A has been widely deployed and MP-
   BGP is always adopted between ASBRs to learn IP routes.  If the EVPN
   is introduced, there will be propose the inconsistency that IP route
   can be learned through the control plane while the MAC route will be
   learned through the forwarding plane.  This will propose the
   challenge caused by the complex the operation and management.  So in
   Inter-AS EVPN Option-A solution, using BGP between ASBRs, the
   operators can get following benefits:

   1.  Learning of MAC Addresses can be controlled via Peer-Based Policy
   between ASBRs.

   2.  Unified Control-Plane for MAC routing information.

3.3.  Fast Convergence

   The following illustrates the benefits with an example of fast
   convergence in the event of PE to CE network failure.

   [RFC7432] defines a mechanism to efficiently and quickly signal, to
   remote PE nodes, the need to update their forwarding tables upon the
   occurrence of a failure in connectivity to an Ethernet Segment.  This
   mechanism optimizes the withdrawal of MAC Advertisement routes, and
   then optimizes the network convergence time in the event of PE to CE
   failures.  But it still cannot fully provide convergence time that is
   independent of the number of MAC addresses learned by the PE.  There
   exist a situation where the network convergence time is dependent on

   the local MAC learning of PE and the advertisement of them to remote
   PE.

                      +----+ +--------------+
                    Figure 2 Multi-homed EVPN Network

   To illustrate this with an example in the Figure 2, consider two PEs
   (PE1 and PE2) connected to a multi-homed Ethernet Segment ES1.  All-
   Active redundancy mode is assumed.  A given MAC address M1 is learned
   by PE1 but not PE2.  On PE3, the following states may arise:

   o  T1- PE3 receives the Ethernet A-D routes per ESI from PE1 and PE2.

   o  T2- When the MAC Advertisement Route from PE1 and the Ethernet A-D
      routes per ESI from PE1 and PE2 are received, PE3 can forward
      traffic destined to M1 to both PE1 and PE2.

   o  T3- After T2, when the ES1 connected to PE1 fails, PE1 MUST
      withdraw its Ethernet A-D route per ESI, then PE3 forwards traffic
      destined to M1 to PE2 only.

   o  T4- After T3, PE1 MUST also withdraw the MAC advertisement routes
      (M1) that are impacted by the failure.  Before PE2 learns M1 and
      advertises a MAC route for M1, PE3 will treat traffic to M1 as
      unknown unicast.  If the behavior is to drop the unknown unicast
      based on administrative policy, the traffic to M1 on PE3 will be
      interrupted.  Note that had PE2 also advertised a MAC route for M1
      before PE1 withdraws its MAC route, then PE3 would have continued
      forwarding traffic destined to M1.

   In the above example, once the local MAC learning of PE was done via
   control plane, both PE1 and PE2 will advertise a MAC Advertisement
   route for M1, then PE3 could continue forwarding traffic destined to
   M1 in the event of ES1 connected to PE1 or PE2 fails.  In this case,
   the network convergence time is not dependent of the local MAC
   learning and advertisement of MAC addresses learned by the PE any
   more.

   The benefit can also be achieved in case of single-active redundancy
   mode.

4.  BGP EVPN NLRI Extensions

   A new route type is defined for EVPN NLRI to advertise customer MAC
   route between PE and CE in EVPN:

      + 6 - Customer MAC Advertisement route

   A customer MAC Advertisement route type specific EVPN NLRI consists
   of the following:

                +-----------------------------------------+
                | Ethernet Segment Identifier (10 octets) |
                +-----------------------------------------+
                |        Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)       |
                +-----------------------------------------+
                |      MAC Address Length (1 octet)       |
                +-----------------------------------------+
                |          MAC Address (6 octets)         |
                +-----------------------------------------+
                |       IP Address Length (1 octet)       |
                +-----------------------------------------+
                |       IP Address (4 or 16 octets)       |
                +-----------------------------------------+

   It should be noted that the Route Distinguisher (RD) is not used
   since the customer MAC routes are always exchanged in the context of
   unawareness of Ethernet VPN.

   Another solution option is to reuse EVPN MAC Advertisement Route
   defined in [RFC7432] to exchange MAC route information between CE and
   PE.  In this case RD, MPLS Label1 and MPLS Label2 fields SHOULD be
   set as 0.  In addition, the RT for the route SHOULD also be set as 0.

5.  Exchanging C-MAC Routes

   This section describes the procedures of exchanging customer MAC
   routes between PE and CE.  This document assumes that a CE and a PE
   exchange MAC routes over a direct BGP session.

5.1.  Originating MAC Route at the CE router

   When a CE receives packets in a given VLAN from interfaces, other
   than interfaces connected to the PE, it learns MAC addresses in the
   data plane.  If the given VLAN is in the setting of VLANs across the
   Ethernet links attached to a given PE, the CE MAY advertises the MAC

Internet-Draft      Using BGP between PE & CE in EVPN       October 2015


   addresses it learns in the data plane to the given PE, using MP-BGP
   and the specific MAC Route, in the control plane.  The MAC Route is
   constructed as follows:

    + The field of the Ethernet Segment Identifier is reserved for
      future use.

    + The Ethernet Tag ID is set to the VLAN ID from which the MAC
      addresses are learned.

    + The MAC address length field is in bits and it is typically set to
      48.  However this specification enables specifying the MAC address
      as a prefix; in which case, the MAC address length field is set to
      the length of the prefix.  This provides the ability to aggregate
      MAC addresses if the deployment environment supports that.

    + The MAC address is set to the value of MAC address the CE learned.
      The encoding of a MAC address MUST be the 6-octet MAC address
      specified by [802.1D-ORIG] [802.1D-REV].  If the MAC address is
      advertised as a prefix then the trailing bits of the prefix MUST
      be set to 0 to ensure that the entire prefix is encoded as 6
      octets.

    + The IP Address field is optional.  By default, the IP Address
      Length field is set to 0 and the IP Address field is omitted from
      the route.  When a valid IP address or address prefix needs to be
      advertised (e.g., for ARP suppression purposes or for inter-subnet
      switching), it is then encoded in this route.  In this case, the
      IP Address Length field is in bits and it is the length of the IP
      prefix.  This provides the ability to advertise IP address
      prefixes when the deployment environment supports that.

    + The encoding of an IP Address MUST be either 4 octets for IPv4 or
      16 octets for IPv6.  When the IP Address is advertised as a
      prefix, then the trailing bits of the prefix MUST be set to 0 to
      ensure that the entire prefix is encoded as either 4 or 16 octets.
      The length field of Ethernet NLRI is sufficient to determine
      whether an IP address/prefix is encoded in this route and if so,
      whether the encoded IP address/prefix is IPv4 or IPv6.

    + The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route
      MUST be set to the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the advertising CE.

   It should be noted that the BGP advertisement for the MAC route does
   not need to carry the Route Target (RT) attributes because of its
   unawareness of Ethernet VPN.

5.2.  Receiving a MAC Route by the PE router

   When a PE receives a MAC route from a CE, it learns the MAC addresses
   advertised in the MAC route in the control plane and associates the
   MAC addresses with the Ethernet Segment from which it can reach to
   the advertising CE and the VLAN carried in the MAC route.

   The PE SHOULD install forwarding state for the associated MAC
   addresses based on the Ethernet Segment and VLAN inferred from the
   MAC route.

   In addition, the PE SHOULD advertises the MAC addresses it learns
   from CE in the control plane, to all the other PEs in the associated
   EVPN instance, using MP-BGP and the MAC Advertisement route defined
   in [RFC7432].  For example, the PE learns a MAC address M1 on a
   multi-homed Ethernet Segment (ES1) and on a VLAN 10, and the VLAN 10
   is bundled to EVPN A.  The PE SHOULD advertise the MAC address M1 to
   all the other PEs in EVPN A.

   The construction of the MAC Advertisement route and procedures of
   handling the MAC Advertisement route on receiving it are specified in
   [RFC7432].
