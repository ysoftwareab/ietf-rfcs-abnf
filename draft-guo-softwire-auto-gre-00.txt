Abstract 

   This document proposes an auto-configured GRE tunnel mechanism in hub 
   and spoke network. This mechanism automatically configures GRE tunnel 
   encapsulation parameters to end user devices using DHCP protocol. It 
   can also simplify and drive IPv6 transition.

1. Introduction 

   The Softwires Working Group has standardized Layer Two Tunneling 
   Protocol version 2 (L2TPv2) as the phase 1 protocol to be deployed in 
   the Softwire "Hub and Spoke" solution space [RFC5571]. L2TPv2 
   supports  "IPvX/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPvY"  encapsulations  and  fulfills 
   requirements in [RFC4925]. Especially L2TPv2 has good capacity to 
   traverse NAT, since L2TPv2 runs over UDP.  

   However, as a multi-layers encapsulation protocol, L2TPv2 has to 
   carry multiple protocol headers per data packet. It is complicated 
   and costly, mostly used for Virtual Private Network (VPN). Most 
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) is too simple to be L2TPv2 
   initiator. 

   In  most  scenarios,  providers  do  not  need  such  a  complicated 
   transition method that meets all requirements in [RFC4925]. For 
   example, NAT does NOT exist in many scenarios. A simple Auto GRE 
   (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel, proposed in this document, 
   can meet most requirements in [RFC4925] except for the NAT traverse 
   requirements. 

   GRE [RFC2784] is widely deployed in the ISP networks. Up to now, GRE 
   tunnels are stateless and configured manually. The proposed Auto GRE 
   mechanism does not modify encapsulation format of GRE, but adds 
   signaling, using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131] 
   or DHCP for IPv6 [RFC3315], so that the softwire can be automatically 
   set up or torn down. 

   Carrier Grade NATs (CGNs) in IPv4/IPv6 transition are such scenarios 
   that do not require NAT traversal. CGN solutions have recently been 
   proposed to simplify IPv4/IPv6 transition in the edge network. 
   [Incremental CGN] and [DS-lite CGN] describes a few dispersive IPvX 
   users bridge IPvX Internet by softwire spanning IPvY infrastructure. 
   Both scenarios require users set up tunnels to CGN. Obviously, there 
   is no NAT between CPE and CGN in both DS-lite and Incremental CGN 
   scenarios. 

   Additionally, the auto-configure mechanism described in the document 
   can also support auto IP-in-IP tunnel. The advantage of GRE is more 
   manageable and extensible than IP-in-IP. Auto IP-in-IP tunnel is out 
   of the focus of this document.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Auto GRE Tunnel 

   Auto GRE tunnel mechanism enables a Softwire Initiator (SI) exchanges 
   tunnel control signals with its correspondent Softwire Concentrator 
   (SC). DHCP is commonly used when an administrator requires more 
   control to hosts. DHCP or DHCPv6 is adopted as the signaling protocol. 
   This document does NOT project to invent a new signaling protocol but 
   makes full use of DHCP and GRE combinations. 

   The SI in Auto GRE may be a CPE, a host or an edge router. The SC may 
   be a tunnel concentrator or CGN. 

   The Process is described in the following sub-sections. 

3.1. Preliminary Phase 

3.1.1. SC discovery on SI 

   Before tunneling to SC, SI MUST get the address and other parameters 
   of a SC. The information may be configured manually on the SI.  

   However, manual configuration are difficult to operate when the 
   information of the SC changes. [Discovery] proposes an auto SC 
   discovery  method  by  extending  DHCP  or  Point-to-Point  Protocol 
   (PPP)[RFC1661]. 

3.1.2. Pre-configuration on SC 

   To support auto-configure GRE tunnel, the SC MUST configure a GRE 
   tunnel interface and listen to GRE packet being sent to the interface. 
   A DHCP snooping is REQUIRED in SC in order to trigger configuration 
   and updating state of the tunnel. 

3.2. Tunnel Establishment  

   To set up softwires to the SC, a SI should send a DHCP request 
   message with GRE encapsulation to request an inner address of the 
   tunnel and other relevant network parameters. The destination IP of 
   outer layer header in GRE encapsulation comes from description of 
   Section 2.1.1 SC discovery. The outer source IP uses the IP address 
   of the SI.

Internet-Draft   draft-guo-softwire-auto-gre-00.txt       October 2009 
    

   When SC receives the DHCP request message with GRE encapsulation, it 
   SHOULD look up the outer source IP of the packet in its tunnel client 
   list. If it is a new client, the SC adds source IP into the tunnel 
   client list, decapsulates GRE header and deals with the DHCP request. 
   The SC sends the DHCP reply message, which allocates the inner 
   address, with GRE encapsulation too. The source and destination 
   address in IP header of DHCP reply should comply with DHCP or DHCPv6. 
   The source and destination of the GRE encapsulation MUST originate 
   from the destination and source IP of outer GRE encapsulation of the 
   DHCP request message. 

   The tunnel client list records the information of all tunnel clients. 
   Each entry of the list describes information of a tunnel, includes 
   the mapping of the inner address of tunnel and the outer IP of client, 
   the lifetime of the tunnel. The lifetime of the tunnel SHOULD 
   synchronize with the lifetime of SI inner address. For inbound 
   traffic, SC checks the tunnel client list according to destination 
   address of the packet and decides which tunnel the traffic should be 
   forwarded to. 

   While SI receives the DHCP reply message with GRE encapsulation, SI 
   configures itself with the allocated address and other network 
   parameters in the DHCP message. 

3.3. Tunnel Maintenance 

   DHCP address lifetime or lease is used for the SC to maintain tunnel 
   state. A SI SHOULD periodically renew the lifetime of the address to 
   keep tunnel alive. The SI renew period SHOULD be shorter than the 
   lifetime. When the lifetime of SI inner address is renewed, the 
   lifetime  of  the  tunnel  in  the  tunnel  client  list  SHOULD  be 
   synchronized. Once the lifetime of tunnel expires, the SC tears down 
   the tunnel and releases resource. The lifetime SHOULD be set to 
   appropriate time so that SC deletes inactivity tunnel as well as 
   avoids too frequently renew procedures. 

3.4. Tunnel Teardown 

   Tunnels are naturally torn down when the SI inner address expires, as 
   is described in Section 2.3. 

   If the SI wants to actively tear down the GRE tunnel, it will send a 
   DHCP Release Message with GRE encapsulation and then delete the 
   tunnel. While SC receives the DHCP release message encapsulated in 
   GRE tunnel, it tears down the related Auto GRE tunnel.

4. Application Example of Auto GRE Tunnel 

4.1. Auto GRE Tunnel deploys in IPv6 network 

   Figure 1 illustrates how Auto GRE tunnel deploys in DS lite case. The 
   CPE and CGN in DS lite are respectively the SI and SC in softwire.

      Figure 1 Auto-configuring GRE tunnel in DS lite case 

   Before initiating tunnel establishment, the SI may get information of 
   SC by the method mentioned in Section 2.2.1. The SC is listening to 
   GRE setup requests of all clients.  

   When the SI starts to set up Auto GRE tunnel, it sends a DHCPv4 
   Request message with GRE encapsulation to the SC's IPv6 address 
   2001:DB8::1. The source IP of GRE header is 2001:DB8::5. 

   Once a SC receives the packet, it answers an IPv4 address in DHCPv4 
   reply message with GRE encapsulation. At the same time, the SC 
   creates and configures a new GRE tunnel. Because the SC allocate IP

Internet-Draft   draft-guo-softwire-auto-gre-00.txt       October 2009 
    

   address 10.0.0.2 to the SI, a mapping "inner address of tunnel: 
   10.0.0.2, outer IP of client: 2001:DB8::5" is added into the tunnel 
   client list on the SC. 

   After SI received the DHCPv4 packet with GRE encapsulation, it 
   completes inner address configuration based on parameters in the 
   DHCPv4 message. Finally the application IPv4 traffic can pass through 
   the GRE tunnel. 

   The SI should periodically intercommunicate DHCPv4 Request/Reply 
   message with GRE encapsulation to keep tunnel alive. The SI may 
   either sends a DHCPv4 release message in GRE tunnel to inform CGN 
   tears down or wait until lifetime expires. 

5. Security Considerations 

   [RFC5619] has listed security analysis and requirements in hub and 
   spoke network. It is watchful for SC to resist Denial of Service.  
   DHCP security mechanisms [RFC3118, RFC3315, SecDHC] can be used when 
   necessary. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
