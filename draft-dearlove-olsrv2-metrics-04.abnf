A_metric = DEFAULT_METRIC).

Type = SYMMETRIC is present, but to represent only routing MPR status
n = k+1.

L_status = SYMMETRIC and L_out_metric = N_out_metric of the
R_dest_addr = current address, then add a Routing Tuple with:

R_metric = (R_metric of the previous Tuple) + T_metric,
R_dist = h+1, and the Neighbor Tuple corresponding to the
R_metric = N_out_metric + N2_out_metric, R_dist = 2 and the
R_metric = (R_metric of the previous Tuple) + AN_metric,
