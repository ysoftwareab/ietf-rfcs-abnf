Internet-Draft     Requirements for PCE Applied in OTN         July 2009


1.  Introduction

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity that is able to compute
   Label Switched Paths (LSP) in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering (MPLS-TE) and General MPLS (GMPLS) networks, as defined
   in [RFC4655].  Any network element can act as a Path Computation
   Client (PCC) that requests the PCE to compute a set of TE-LSPs based
   on some kinds of constraints.  The communication protocol between PCE
   and PCC or between cooperating PCEs is defined in [RFC5440].

   G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) are usually responsible for
   transmitting data for the client layer, as specified in the ITU-T
   G.709 recommendation [G.709].  It provides Optical Channel Data Unit
   (ODUk) digital layer and Optical Channel (OCh) optical layer cross
   connection based on different service bandwidth requests.

   Optical signal along the optical path maybe be altered by the optical
   impairments that is classified into two categories, linear and
   nonlinear.  Linear effects, such as amplifier spontaneous emission
   (ASE), polarization mode dispersion (PMD), chromatic dispersion (CD)
   are independent of signal power and affect wavelength individually.
   However, nonlinearities (such as non-linear phase shift (NLPS)) are
   much more complex: they generate not only impairments on each
   channel, but also crosstalk between channels.  Given that the
   existing standards covering optical characteristics (impairments) and
   the knowledge of how the impact of impairments may be estimated along
   a path, [RFC4054] provides an overview of some critical optical
   impairments and their routing Wavelength implications.  Framework for
   impairment aware path computation based on the PCE architecture in
   WSON can be found in [wson-impairments] and
   [wson-routing-wavelength].

   [wson-impairments] considers pre-setting a limited Bit Error Ratio
   (BER) value to estimate the calculated optical path quality.  The
   limited BER value is dependent on the bit rate, the signal format and
   Forwarding Error Coding (FEC), however, the last two factors are
   determined by the digital encapsulation.  In order to give a
   reasonable limited BER value, it is better to consider the ODUK and
   OCh layer provisioning together in OTN.

3.  PCE Applications

   Figure 1 shows a simple network topology, where NE1, NE2, NE3, NE4,
   NE5 are all OTN equipments, such as OXC, PXC, ROADM, etc.  PCE is a
   function entity that is incorporated into the NMS or remote from the
   NMS using XML or PCEP to communicate with each other.  PCE can share
   the traffic engineering database (TED) with NMS, get the TED with the
   help of IGP-TE, or the network elements (NEs) just send their traffic
   parameters directly to PCE using the method described in [PCE-TED].
   No matter what methods we can assume that PCE knows the modulation
   formats and FEC types NE can support.  Here for simplicity, we do not
   figure out the position of NMS.  Assuming that one Ethernet service
   with 40G bandwidth is required from C1 to C3, the required signal
   format/FEC needs to be specified by PCC (N1), but could also be
   determined by PCE automatically based on policy, configuration, or
   network capabilities.  This is related to the policies which can be
   implemented per [RFC5394].  The requirements described according to
   applied policies will list in the next two sections.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for PCE Applied in OTN         July 2009


3.1.  Requirements when PCC Specifies the Signal Format

   In this case, the PCC specifies the transport scheme for the service
   based on the requested bandwidth and the pre-configured transport
   policies when receiving the service request from C1 to C3 from client
   layer, then requests the PCE to compute the corresponding path.  For
   example, the node N1 makes a decision to adopt Differential
   Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (DQPSK) as the signal modulation format
   with FEC coding, then it will determine the pre-FEC that should be
   specified in the PCReq message.  The pre-FEC value is out of the
   scope of this document, but apparently should take into account of
   the following factors: (1)the format/rate will give a required value
   that must be met in the receiver. (2)the degradation caused by PMD,
   OSNR, NPLS should be considered in the pre-setting value. (3)the
   margin reserved for the future operation/repair. (4)FEC revision.

   When receiving the PCReq message, PCE computes the path that
   satisfies the set of constraints in the PCReq message.  If
   successful, the corresponding path will be returned to PCC in the
   PCRep message.  Note that the PCE should return the calculated BER
   value in the PCRep message.

3.2.  Requirements when PCE Determines the Signal Format

   In this case, when receiving the request for a service from C1 to C3
   from the client layer, the PCC sends the PCReq message with the
   bandwidth object to the PCE before the ODUK cross connection.

   The PCE determines the signal modulation format/FEC function for the
   service based on the requested bandwidth, the estimated distance
   between N1 and N3, and the pre-configured transport policies after
   receiving the PCReq message, whereafter sets the pre-FEC value
   considering the factors the same as described in Section 3.1.  If PCE
   can successfully work out the lightpath that satisfies the limited
   BER value , the information of the corresponding signal modulation
   format and FEC function will be sent to the PCC in the PCRep message
   in order that the PCC can set up the ODUk cross connection correctly.
   Of course, the calculated BER value should also be given to the PCC.

3.3.  Source Routing

   In the transparent optical networks, the middle NE (e.g.  N2/N4/N5 in
   figure 1) can not see the signal modulation format and FEC type, so
   the calculated light path can be end-to-end path from source to
   destination.  However, the middle NE may terminate the optical signal
   in the opaque optical networks.  In such cases, the PCE should give
   back to PCC the related information that every opaque hop's
   modulation format and FEC type.  When signaling, PCC put this

   information in the ERO object of RSVP-TE, so every NE can use this
   information to setup the cross connection.


4.   IANA Considerations

   TBD.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document just focuses on the requirements of applying PCE in the
   OTN networks, so there is no additional security need to be
   considered until it need extend PCEP to support these requirements.
