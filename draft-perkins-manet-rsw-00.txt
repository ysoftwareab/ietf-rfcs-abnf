1.  Introduction

   It is often desirable to identify which of several available routes
   offers the best signal strength for data transmission, de-emphasizing
   other considerations such as number of hops.  However, signal
   strength is in certain ways less suitable for use as a routing
   metric; in particular, the signal strength of a path with several
   hops is not as easy to calculate as cost metrics such as hop count.

   Instead of signal strength, we calculate a metric proportional to the
   weakness of the signal, in order to obtain a cost metric.  The route
   having the links with the best signal strength is then chosen in
   preference to other routes, by choosing the route presenting the
   lowest cost as measured by the Received Signal Weakness (RSW) metric.
   The total signal weakness cost for a route is the sum of the signal
   weakness measurements at each hop, so that the RSW cost metric is
   additive, monotonic, and easy to calculate.

2.  Received Signal Weakness Metric

   The received signal strength for packets received from a neighbor is
   an important factor relevant to the reliability of the link between
   the receiving node and its neighbor.  Notice that the received signal
   strength can vary over time even if the neighboring devices are not
   moving.

   For a route R as follows composed of links between nodes N_1 ... N_k:

      N_1 <--> N_2 <--> N_3 <--> .... <--> N_k

   denote the link between N_{i} and N_{i+1} by L_{i,i+1} and the
   received signal weakness over link L_{i,i+1} by RSW_{i,i+1}.  The RSW
   cost for route R is the sum of the RSW costs for each link, or in
   other words M_rsw(R) = SUM M_rsw(L_{i,i+1}) [i == 1..k-1], where
   M_rsw is the metric value for the RSW metric.

3.  Units for RSW metric

   The received power as measured (say, in mW) for incoming packets may
   have quite a large dynamic range, but the measurements are also quite
   variable and so great precision is unlikely to be required.  In order
   to fit in eight bits, the received power measurement is normalized to
   be within the range from 0 to 1, where the minimum measurable power
   P_min maps to 1 (the highest cost value) and the maximum measurable
   power P_max maps to 0 (the lowest cost value).  In other words, the
   measured received power P_meas maps to a normalized value P_norm =
   (P_max - P_meas) / (P_max - P_min).

   It is desirable to increase the cost of low signal strength so that
   weak signals are strongly disfavored.  For this purpose, P_norm,
   which is a positive number no greater than 1, can be exponentiated.
   Using RSW_exponent = (1/8) is proposed for this purpose, and
   effectively reduces the cost associated with using links that have
   good measured values for the received signal strength.

   For the purposes of this initial draft, it is proposed to use a
   precision that can be carried in an 8 bit metric.  That would allow
   Max_RSW to attain the value 255, but that value should be reserved to
   indicate a route cost of "infinity"; i.e., the route cost is too
   large to be represented.  For that reason, Max_RSW is defined to be
   254.  In addition, we define Min_RSW to be 1, so that there is some
   nonzero RSW cost for every link even if the measurement of the
   received signal strength is the same as P_min.  These definitions of
   Max_RSW and Min_RSW determine the scaling factor for P_norm, namely
   (Max_RSW - Min_RSW).

   Given the scaling factor and shaping function P_norm^RSW_exponent as
   above, the RSW metric is defined as M_rsw = floor((Max_RSW-Min_RSW) *
   (P_norm^RSW_exponent)) + MinRSW

4.  Cost() and Loop_Free() functions for the RSW metric

   To be useful with AODVv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2], it is helpful to
   define functions Cost() and Loop_Free() for the RSW metric.  The
   purpose of the Loop_Free() function is to provide assurance that a
   selected route is loop-free.

   The definition of the Cost() function for RSW is exactly the same as
   the RSW metric, M_rsw.  In other words, using RSW, Cost(L) = M_rsw(L)
   and Cost(R) = M_rsw(R) for a link L and a route R.

   For routes R1 and R2, Loop_Free(R1, R2) for RSW is defined as
   follows:

      LoopFree(R1,R2) := M_rsw(R1) < M_rsw(R2)

   or, in other words, LoopFree(R1,R2) returns TRUE if the cost of R1 is
   less than the cost of R2 (cost as measured by the RSW metric).

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The routing metric defined in the document should be assigned a value
   from the "AODVv2 Metric Types" registry [I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2].
