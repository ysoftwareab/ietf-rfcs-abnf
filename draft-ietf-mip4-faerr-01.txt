Abstract

   This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agents
   operating Mobile IP for IPv4.  The new extension option allows a
   foreign agent to supply an error code without disturbing the data
   supplied by the Home Agent within the Registration Reply message.
   In this way, the mobile node can verify that the Registration
   Reply message was generated by the Home Agent even in cases where
   the foreign agent is required by protocol to insert new status
   information into the Registration Reply message.

Internet Draft              FA Error Extension              16 June 2005


1. Introduction

   This document specifies a new non-skippable extension for use
   by Foreign Agents operating Mobile IP for IPv4 [2].  The new
   extension option allows a foreign agent to supply an error code
   without disturbing the data supplied by the Home Agent within the
   Registration Reply message.  In this way, the mobile node can verify
   that the Registration Reply message was generated by the Home Agent
   even in cases where the foreign agent is required by protocol to
   insert new status information into the Registration Reply message.


2. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].  Other
   terminology is used as already defined in [2].


3. FA Error Extension Format

   The format of the FA Error Extension conforms to the Short Extension
   format specified for Mobile IPv4 [2].  The FA Error Extension is not
   skippable.

         information to the mobile node.

Internet Draft              FA Error Extension              16 June 2005


4. Operation and Use of the FA Error Extension

   The FA Error extension is only valid for use within Mobile IPv4
   Registration Reply messages.  The FA Error Extension is not
   skippable.  A mobile node that cannot correctly interpret the
   contents of the FA Error Extension MUST NOT use the care-of
   address provided in the Registration Reply message, until another
   Registration Request message has been sent and a successful
   Registration Reply message received.

   Status codes allowable for use within the FA Error Extension are
   within the range 64-127.  The currently specified codes are as
   follows:

       64 reason unspecified
       65 administratively prohibited
       66 insufficient resources
       68 home agent failed authentication
       71 poorly formed Reply
       77 invalid care-of address
       78 registration timeout

   as defined in RFC 3344 [2] for use by the Foreign Agent.  Status
   codes for use with the FA Error extensions must not be differently
   defined for use in the Code field of Registration Reply messages.

   When a foreign agent appends a FA Error Extension to the Registration
   Reply as received from the Home Agent, it has to update the UDP
   Length field in the UDP header [3] to account for the extra 4 bytes
   of length.


5. Mobile Node Considerations

   If a mobile node receives a successful Registration Reply (status
   code 0 or 1), with a FA Error extension indicating that the foreign
   agent is not honoring Registration Reply, the mobile node SHOULD
   then send a deregistration message to the home agent.  In this way,
   the home agent will not maintain a registration status that is
   inconsistent with the status maintained by the foreign agent.


6. IANA Considerations

   This specification reserves one number for the FA Error extension
   (see section 3) from the space of numbers for nonskippable mobility
   extensions (i.e., 0-127) defined in the specification for Mobile
   IPv4 [2].

Internet Draft              FA Error Extension              16 June 2005


   This specification also creates a new number space of sub-types for
   the type number of this extension.  Sub-type zero is to be allocated
   from this number space for the protocol extension specified in this
   document.  Future allocations from this number space require IETF
   consensus.

   The status codes which are allowable in the FA error extension are a
   subset of the status codes defined in the specification for Mobile
   IPv4 [2].  If, in the future, additional status codes are defined for
   Mobile IPv4, the definition for each new status code must indicate
   whether or not the new status code is allowable for use in the FA
   Error extension.


7. Security Considerations

   The extension in this document improves the security features
   of Mobile IPv4 by allowing the mobile node to be assured of the
   authenticity of the information supplied within a Registration
   Request.  Previously, whenever the foreign agent was required to
   provide status information to the mobile node, it could only do so
   by destroying the ability of the mobile device to authenticated the
   Mobile-Home Authentication Extension data.

   In many typical cases, the mobile node will not have a security
   association with the foreign agent that has sent the extension.
   Thus, the mobile node will be unable to ascertain that the foreign
   agent sending the extended Registration Reply message is the same
   foreign agent that earlier received the associated Registration
   Request from the mobile node.  Because of this, a malicious foreign
   agent could cause a mobile node to operate as if the registration had
   failed, when in fact its home agent and a correctly operating foreign
   agent had both accepted the mobile node's Registration Request.  In
   order to reduce the vulnerability to such maliciously transmitted
   Registration Reply messages with the unauthenticated extension, the
   mobile node MAY delay processing of such Registration Reply messages
   for a short while in order to determine whether another authentic
   Registration Reply might be received fromm the true foreign agent.
