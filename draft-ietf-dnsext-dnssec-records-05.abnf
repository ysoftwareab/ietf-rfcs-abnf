signature = sign(RRSIG_RDATA | RR(1) | RR(2)... ) where

            RRSIG_RDATA is the wire format of the RRSIG RDATA fields
               with the Signer's Name field in canonical form and

               "owner" is the fully qualified owner name of the RRset in
               canonical form (for RRs with wildcard owner names, the
               wildcard label is included in the owner name);

               Each RR MUST have the same owner name as the RRSIG RR;

               Each RR MUST have the same class as the RRSIG RR;

               Each RR in the RRset MUST have the RR type listed in the
               RRSIG RR's Type Covered field;

               Each RR in the RRset MUST have the TTL listed in the
               RRSIG Original TTL Field;

               Any DNS names in the RDATA field of each RR MUST be in
               canonical form; and

               The RRset MUST be sorted in canonical order.
