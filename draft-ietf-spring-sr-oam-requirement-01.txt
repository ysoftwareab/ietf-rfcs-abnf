1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] introduces and explains Segment
   Routing architecture that leverages source routing and tunneling
   standards which can be applied directly to MPLS dataplane with no
   changes on forwarding plane and on IPv6 dataplane with new Routing
   Extension Header.

   This document list the OAM requirements for Segment Routing based
   network which can further be used to produce OAM tools, either
   through enhancing existing OAM tools or constructing new OAM tools,
   for path liveliness and service validation.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   SR OAM Packet: OAM probe originated and processed within SR domain(s)

   ECMP: Equal Cost Multipath

   SR: Segment Routing

Internet-DraftOAM Requirements for Segment Routing Network December 2015


   UCMP: Unequal Cost Multipath

   Initiator: Centralized OAM initiator or PMS as referred in
   [I-D.geib-spring-oam-usecase]

4.  Detailed Requirement list

   This section list the OAM requirement for Segment Routing based
   network.  The below listed requirement MUST be supported with both
   MPLS and IPv6 dataplane:

   REQ#1:   SR OAM MUST support both On-demand and Continuous OAM
            functionality.

   REQ#2:   The SR OAM packet MUST follow exactly the same path as
            dataplane traffic.

   REQ#3:   The SR OAM packet MUST have the ability to discover and
            exercise equal cost multipath (ECMP) paths.

   REQ#4:   The SR OAM packet MUST have the ability to discover and
            exercise unequal cost multipath (UCMP) paths.

   REQ#5:   The SR OAM packet MUST have ability to exercise any
            available paths, not just best path available.

   REQ#6:   The forwarding semantic of adjacency Segment ID raises a
            need for additional consideration to detect any failure in
            forwarding to the right adjacency.  SR OAM MUST have the
            ability to detect any failure in Node SID and adjacency
            segment based forwarding.

   REQ#7:   SR OAM SHOULD have the ability to allow the Initiator to
            control the return path from any transit or egress
            responder.

   REQ#8:   SR OAM MUST have the ability to be initialized from an
            arbitrary node to perform connectivity verification and
            continuity check to any other node within SR domain.

   REQ#9:   In case of any failure with continuity check, SR OAM SHOULD
            support rapid Connectivity Fault localization to isolate the
            node on which the failure occurs.

   REQ#10:  SR OAM SHOULD also have the ability to be initialized from a
            centralized controller.

Internet-DraftOAM Requirements for Segment Routing Network December 2015


   REQ#11:  When SR OAM is initialized from centralized controller, it
            MUST have the ability to alert any edge node in SR domain
            about the corresponding path or service failure.  The node
            on receiving the alert MAY take a local protection action or
            pop an informational message.

   REQ#12:  When SR OAM is initialized from centralized controller, it
            SHOULD support node redundancy.  If primary Initiator fails,
            secondary one MUST take over the responsibility without
            having any impact on customer traffic.

   REQ#13:  SR OAM MUST have the ability to measure Packet loss, Packet
            Delay or Delay variation using Active (using synthetic
            probe) and Passive (using data stream) mode.

   REQ#14:  When a new path is instantiated, SR OAM SHOULD allow path
            verification without noticeable delay.

   REQ#15:  The above listed requirements SHOULD be supported without
            any scalability limitation imposed and SHOULD be extensible
            to accommodate any new SR functionality.

   REQ#16:  SR OAM SHOULD minimize the need to create or maintain per
            path state entry in any other nodes other than the
            Initiator.

   REQ#17:  When traffic engineering is initiated by centralized
            controller device, and when SR OAM is performed by
            individual nodes, there MUST be a mechanism to communicate
            failure to centralized controller device.

   REQ#18:  When service instruction is present in SR OAM packet header,
            there MUST be a method to disallow applying the service to
            the OAM packet to handle cases where that may result in
            unintended corruption of the OAM packet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not propose any IANA consideration.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document list the OAM requirement for Segment Routing network
   and does not raise any security considerations.
