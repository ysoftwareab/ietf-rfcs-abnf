Abstract

   With the DS record [1] the concept of key-signing and zone-signing
   keys has been introduced.  Key-signing keys are the keys that sign
   the keyset only.  In general, key-signing keys are the keys that are
   pointed to by DS records and are the first keys to be used when
   following a chain of trust into the zone.  The key-signing keys only
   sign the KEY RRset at the apex of a zone, zone- signing keys sign all
   other data in a zone.  We propose a flag to distinguish the key-
   signing key from other keys in the KEY RR set during DNSSEC
   operations.

Internet-Draft     KEY RR Key-Signing Key (KSK) Flag      September 2002


1. Introduction

   "All keys are equal but some keys are more equal than others" [5]

   With the DS record [1] the concept of key-signing and zone-signing
   keys has been introduced into DNSSEC[2].  In general these are the
   keys that are pointed to by DS records and are the first keys to be
   used when following the chain of trust into a zone ( secure entry
   points of the zone).  These key-signing keys may also be configured
   in resolver systems that use zones as a trusted root[3] for a secure
   island.

   Early deployment tests have shown that during the key-exchange
   between the parent and the child it is useful to highlight which keys
   are to be used as the secure entry point to a zone.  We introduce the
   Key-Signing Key flag to indicate this special 'administrative' status
   of the key.  The availability of the flag allows the key exchange to
   be automated where, without the flag, some additional out-of-band
   communication is needed.

                                KEY RR Format



   The KSK bit (TBD) in the flags field is assigned to be the key-
   signing flag.  If set the key is intended to be used as key-signing
   key.  No special meaning should be assigned to the bit not being set.
   The draft proposes using the current 15'th bit [4] as the KSK bit.
   This way operators can tell the difference between key and zone-
   signing keys from the decimal representation of the flag field; it is
   odd or even respectively.

3. DNSSEC Protocol Changes

   The use of the KSK flag does not change the DNS resolution and
   resolution protocol.  The KSK flag is only used to provide a hint
   about the different administrative properties and MUST NOT be used
   during the resolving process.

4. Operational Guidelines

   By setting the KSK flag on a particular key, zone administrators
   indicate that that key SHOULD be used as the secure entry point for
   their zone.  Therefore zone administrators SHOULD set the bit only
   for zone keys that are used to sign the KEY RRset and are intended to
   act as the first link in the chain of trust for their zone.

   Parent zone administrators and resolver administrators that want to
   configure a key-signing key as their 'trusted key' MAY choose to
   ignore the flag.

   Using the flag a key roll over can be automated.  The parent can use
   an existing trust relation to verify keysets in which a new key with
   the KSK flag appears.

   If the bit is modified during the lifetime of the key then this would
   have impact on the keytag and on the hash data in the DS RRs
   intending to point to this key.  The bit SHOULD NOT be modified once
   the key has been put into use.

5. Security Considerations

   The flag MUST NOT be used in the resolution protocol or to determine
   the security status of a key.  The flag is to be used for
   administrative purposes only.

   No trust in a key should be inferred from this flag - trust must be
   inferred from an existing chain of trust or an out-of-band exchange.

   Since this flag might be used for automating key exchanges, we think
   the following consideration is in place.

   Automated mechanisms for roll over of the DS RR might be vulnerable
   to a class of replay attacks.  This might happen after a key exchange
   where a keyset, containing two keys with the KSK flag set, is sent to
   the parent.  The parent verifies the keyset with the existing trust
   relation and creates the new DS RR from the key that the current DS
   is not pointing to.  This key exchange might be replayed.  Parents
   are encouraged to implement a replay defence.  A simple defence can
   be based on a registry of keys that have been used to generate DS RRs

   during the most recent roll over.

6. IANA Considerations

   draft-ietf-dnsext-restrict-key-for-dnssec [4] eliminates all flags
   field except for the zone key flag in the KEY RR.  We propose to use
   the 15'th bit as the KSK bit; the decimal representation of the
   flagfield will then be odd for key-signing keys and even for zone-
   signing keys.

7. Internationalization Considerations

   There are no internationalization considerations

8. Document Changes

8.1 draft version 00 -> 01

      Clean up of references and correction of typos;

      modified Abstract text a little;

      Added explicit warning for replay attacks to the security section;

      Removed the text that hinted on a distinction between a key-
      signing key configured in resolvers and in parent zones.


8.2 draft version 01 -> 02

      Added IANA and Internationalization section.

      Split references into informational and normative.

      Spelling and style corrections.


8.3 draft version 02 -> 03

      Changed the name from KS to KSK, this to prevent confusion with
      NS, DS and other acronyms in DNS.

      In the security section: Rewrote the section so that it does not
      suggest to use a particular type of registry and that it is clear
      that a key registry is only one of the defences possible.

      Spelling and style corrections

   had with numerous people and ideas published by other folk, Olafur
   Gudmundsson, Daniel Karrenberg, Ed Lewis, Dan Massey and Sam Weiler
   have been helping with providing ideas and feedback.

   This document saw the light during a workshop on DNSSEC operations
   hosted by USC/ISI.
