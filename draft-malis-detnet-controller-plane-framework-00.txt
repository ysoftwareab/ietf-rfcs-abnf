1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides the capability to carry
   specified unicast and/or multicast data flows for real-time
   applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency
   within a network domain.  As discussed in the Deterministic
   Networking Architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], techniques
   used to provide this capability include reserving data plane
   resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all
   of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, providing
   explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with
   the network topology, and distributing data from DetNet flow packets
   over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in
   spite of the loss of a path.

   The DetNet data plane is defined in a set of documents that are
   anchored by the DetNet Data Plane Framework
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework] and the associated DetNet MPLS
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and IP [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] data plane
   specifications, with additional details and subnet mappings provided
   in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip-over-mpls],
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-udp-ip], [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-tsn],

Internet-Draft           DetNet Controller Plane               July 2019


   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip-over-tsn], and
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-tsn-vpn-over-mpls].

   While the Detnet Architecture and Data Plane Framework documents are
   primarily concerned with data plane operations, they do contain some
   references and requirements for functions that would be required in
   order to automate DetNet service provisioning and monitoring via a
   DetNet controller plane.  The purpose of this document is to gather
   these references and requirements into a single document and discuss
   how various possible DetNet controller plane architectures could be
   used to satisfy these requirements, while not providing the actual
   protocol details for a DetNet controller plane solution.  Such
   controller plane protocol solutions will be the subject of subsequent
   documents.

   Note that in the DetNet overall architecture, the controller plane
   includes what are more traditionally considered separate control and
   management planes.  Traditionally, the management plane is primarily
   involved with node and network provisioning, operational OAM for
   performance monitoring, and troubleshooting network behaviors and
   outages, while the control plane is primarily responsible for the
   instantiation and maintenance of flows, MPLS label allocation and
   distribution, and active in-band or out-of-band signaling to support
   these functions.  In the DetNet architecture, all of this
   functionality is combined into a single Controller Plane.  See
   Section 4.4.2 of [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and the aggregation
   of Control and Management planes in [RFC7426] for further details.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   Architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], and the reader is
   assumed to be familiar with that document and its terminology.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  DetNet Controller Plane Requirements

   Other DetNet documents, including [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework], contain requirements for the
   Controller Plane.  For convenience, these requirements have been
   compiled here.  The primary requirements of the DetNet Controller
   Plane are that it must be able to:

   o  Support the dynamic creation, modification, and deletion of DetNet
      flows.  This may include some or all of explicit path
      determination, link bandwidth reservations, restricting flows to
      IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) links, node buffer and
      other resource reservations, specification of required queuing
      disciplines along the path, ability to manage bidirectional flows,
      etc., as needed for a flow.

   o  Support DetNet flow aggregation and de-aggregation via the ability
      to dynamically create and delete flow aggregates (FAs), and be
      able to modify existing FAs by adding or deleting members.

   o  Operate in a converged network domain that contains both DetNet
      and non-DetNet flows.

   o  Allow flow instantiation requests to originate in an end
      application (via an Application Programming Interface (API), via
      static provisioning, or via a dynamic control plane, such as a
      centralized SDN controller or distributed signaling protocols.
      See Section 3 for further discussion of these options.

   o  In the case of the DetNet MPLS data plane, manage DetNet S-Label
      and F-Label allocation and distribution.

   o  Also in the case of the DetNet MPLS data plane, support packet
      replication, duplicate elimination, and packet ordering functions
      (PREOF), and to be able to place these functions at appropriate
      places in the network.

   o  Support applications that require the ability to synchronize the
      clocks in end systems to the extent supported by the DetNet data
      plane.

   o  Support queue control techniques defined in Section 4.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and
      [I-D.finn-detnet-bounded-latency] that require time
      synchronization among network nodes.

   o  Advertise static and dynamic node and link resources such as
      capabilities and adjacencies to other network nodes (for dynamic
      signaling approaches) or to network controllers (for centralized
      approaches).

   o  Adapt to network topology changes such as links or nodes failures.

   o  Scale to handle the number of DetNet flows expected in a domain
      (which may require per-flow signaling or provisioning).  This is

Internet-Draft           DetNet Controller Plane               July 2019


      similar to scalability requirements associated with network
      slicing [I-D.dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn].

   o  Provision flow identification information at each of the nodes
      along the path.  Flow identification may differ depending on the
      location in the network and the DetNet functionality (e.g. transit
      node vs. relay node).

   o  Monitor the performance of DetNet flows to ensure that they are
      meeting required objectives.

3.  DetNet Controller Plane Architecture

   The following sections define three possible classes of DetNet
   control plane architectures: a fully distributed control plane
   utilizing dynamic signaling protocols, a fully centralized SDN-like
   control plane, and a hybrid control plane.  They discuss the various
   information exchanges between entities in the network in each of
   these architectures and the advantages and disadvantages of each
   option.

   In each of the following sections, examples are used to illustrate
   possible mechanisms that could be used in each of the architectures.
   These are not meant to be exhaustive or to preclude any other
   possible mechanism that could be used in place of those used in the
   examples.

3.1.  Distributed Control Plane and Signaling Protocols

   In a fully distributed configuration model, User-to-Network Interface
   (UNI) information is transmitted over a (to-be-defined) DetNet UNI
   protocol from the user side to the network side, and then UNI and
   network configuration information propagate in the network via
   distributed control plane signaling protocols.  Using an RSVP-TE
   traffic-engineered MPLS network as an example:

   1.  An IGP collects topology information and DetNet capabilities of
       the network [draft-geng-detnet-info-distribution];

   2.  The control plane of the ingress edge node receives a flow
       establishment request from the UNI and calculates one or more
       valid path(s);

   3.  Using RSVP-TE [RFC3209], the ingress edge node sends a PATH
       message with an explicit route.  After receiving the PATH
       message, the egress edge node sends a RESV message with the
       distributed label and resource reservation request.

Internet-Draft           DetNet Controller Plane               July 2019


   Current reservation-oriented distributed control plane protocols,
   e.g.  RSVP-TE and Stream Reservation Protocol (SRP)
   [IEEE.802.1Qcc-2018], can only reserve bandwidth along the path,
   while the configuration of a fine-grained schedule, e.g., Time Aware
   Shaping (TAS) [IEEE.802.1QBV_2015], is not supported.  If RSVP-TE or
   SRP were to be used for a DetNet application, it would require
   extensions in order to support queue and scheduler reservations in
   addition to bandwidth reservation.

   As discussed in Section 4.9 of [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture],
   scalability is a primary concern for DetNet, given the large number
   of expected flows in a DetNet domain.  This could potentially be much
   larger than, for example, the number of MPLS traffic tunnels in a
   network using MPLS traffic engineering, which would typically be
   N*(N-1) tunnels, where N is the number of edge routers in the domain.

   Even when flow aggregation is used, DetNet domains can be expected to
   support a very large number of flows that will need particular
   queuing disciplines and/or resource allocation, depending on the
   requirements for each flow.  This could require a large amount of
   dynamic signaling, such as an RSVP-TE session to establish and
   maintain each flow.  Other RSVP-TE scalability concerns are further
   discussed in [RFC5439].

   All of the above tends to argue against a purely distributed control
   plane for DetNet domains.

3.2.  SDN/Fully Centralized Control Plane

   In the fully SDN/centralized configuration model, UNI information is
   transmitted from a Centralized User Configuration (CUC) or from
   applications via an API or northbound interface to a Centralized
   Controller, which is the sole source of routing and forwarding
   information for the domain.  Configurations of nodes for DetNet flows
   are performed by the controller using a protocol such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241]/YANG [RFC6020] or PCE-CC [RFC8283].  For example:

   1.  The controller collects topology information and DetNet
       capabilities of the network via NETCONF/YANG;

   2.  The controller receives a flow establishment request from a UNI
       and calculates one or more valid path(s) through the network;

   3.  The controller chooses the optimal path and configures the
       devices along that path for flow transmission via PCE-CC.

3.3.  Hybrid Control Plane

   In the hybrid model, a controller and control plane protocols work
   together to provide DetNet services, and there are a number of
   possible combinations.  For example:

   1.  A Centralized Controller collects topology information and DetNet
       capabilities of the network via an IGP and/or BGP-LS [RFC7752];

   2.  The controller receives a flow establishment request from a UNI
       and calculates one or more valid path(s) through the network;

   3.  Based on the calculation result, the CNC distributes flow path
       information to the ingress edge node and other information (e.g.
       replication/duplicate elimination) to the relevant nodes.

   4.  Using RSVP-TE, the ingress edge node sends a PATH message with an
       explicit route.  After receiving the PATH message, the egress
       edge node sends a RESV message with the distributed label and
       resource reservation request.

   or

   1.  The controller collects topology information and DetNet
       capability of the network via an IGP or BGP-LS;

   2.  The control plane of the ingress edge node receives a flow
       establishment request via a UNI;

   3.  The Ingress edge node sends the path establishment request to the
       controller through PCEP [RFC5440];

   4.  After path calculation, the CNC sends the path information of the
       flow to the ingress edge node via PCEP;

   5.  Using RSVP-TE, the ingress edge node sends a PATH message with an
       explicit route.  After receiving the PATH message, the egress
       edge node sends a RESV message with the distributed label and
       resource reservation request.

   There are many other variations that could be included in a hybrid
   control plane.  This document cannot discuss all the possible control
   plane mechanisms that could be used in hybrid configuration models.
   Every solution has its own mechanisms and corresponding parameters
   that are required for it to work.

4.  Control Plane for DetNet Domains

   This section discusses control plane issues that are unique to the
   DetNet.

4.1.  DetNet in a Traditional MPLS Domain

   For the purposes of this document, "traditional MPLS" is defined as
   MPLS without the use of segment routing (see Section 4.3 for a
   discussion of MPLS with segment routing) or MPLS-TP [RFC5960].

   In traditional MPLS domains, a dynamic control plane using
   distributed signaling protocols is typically used for the
   distribution of MPLS labels used for forwarding MPLS packets.  The
   dynamic signaling protocols most commonly used for label distribution
   are LDP [RFC5036], RSVP-TE, and BGP [RFC8277] (which enables BGP/
   MPLS-based Layer 3 VPNs [RFC4384] and Layer 2 VPNs [RFC7432]).

   Any of these protocols could be used to distribute DetNet Service
   Labels (S-Labels) and Aggregation Labels
   (A-Labels)[I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].  As discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework], S-Labels are similar to other
   MPLS service labels, such as pseudowire, L3 VPN, and L2 VPN labels,
   and could be distributed in a similar manner, such as through the use
   of targeted LDP or BGP.  If these were to be used for DetNet, they
   would require extensions to support DetNet-specific features such as
   PREOF, aggregation (A-Labels), node resource allocation, and queue
   placement.

   However, as discussed in Section 3.1, distributed signaling protocols
   may have difficulty meeting DetNet's scalability requirements.  MPLS
   also allows SDN-like centralized label management and distribution as
   an alternative to distributed signaling protocols, using protocols
   such as PCEP and OpenFlow [OPENFLOW].

   PCEP, particularly when used as a part of PCE-CC, is a possible
   candidate protocol to use for centralized management of traditional
   MPLS-based DetNet domains.  However, PCE path calculation algorithms
   would need to be extended to include the location determination for
   PREOF nodes in a path, and the means to signal the necessary resource
   reservation and PREOF function placement information to network
   nodes.  See ((?I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller)) for
   further discussion of PCE-CC and PCEP for centralized control of an
   MPLS domain.

4.2.  IP

   In a later revision of this document, this section will discuss
   necessary protocol extensions to existing IP routing protocols such
   as IS-IS and BGP.  It should be noted that a DetNet IP domain is
   simpler than a DetNet MPLS domain, and doesn't support PREOF, so only
   one path per flow or flow aggregate is required, with no path
   merging.

4.3.  DetNet with Segment Routing (SR)

   Segment Routing [RFC8402] is a scalable approach to building network
   domains that utilizes a combination of source routing in packet
   headers and centralized network control to compute paths through the
   network and distribute those paths with associated policy to network
   edge nodes for use in packet headers.  It greatly reduces the amount
   of network signaling associated with distributed signaling protocols
   such as RSVP-TE, and also greatly reduces the amount of state in core
   nodes compared with that required for traditional MPLS and IP
   routing, as the state is now in the packets rather than in the
   routers.  This is especially useful for DetNet, where a very large
   number of flows through a network domain are expected, which would
   otherwise require the instantiation of state for each flow traversing
   each node in the network.

   The DetNet MPLS and IP data planes were specifically constructed to
   allow the use of DetNet with both types of segment routing, SR-MPLS
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] and SRv6
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].

   In the DetNet context, DetNet in an SR-MPLS or SRv6 data plane could
   be used in conjunction with centralized flow management and complete
   label stack distribution to Detnet domain entry nodes via a
   centralized controller.  Extensions to PCEP to allow the use of PCE-
   CC with SR-MPLS

   One possible architecture is PCE-CC combined with SR-MPLS or SRv6.
   Extensions to PCEP to allow the use of PCE-CC with SR-MPLS are
   described in [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr], with
   SRv6 in [I-D.dhody-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-srv6].

   This approach would allow the details of packet or flow treatment to
   be encoded directly in the SIDs on each packet in a flow to reduce
   the amount of state in network nodes.  This approach also allows the
   integration of DetNet domains with general SR-based backbone networks
   in a converged domain.  In this approach, a new set of functions for
   DetNet queuing treatments available in the DetNet domain would need
   to be defined for inclusion in the SR stack.

Internet-Draft           DetNet Controller Plane               July 2019


   This is not the only possible approach.  There is ongoing work on a
   number of alternative signaling mechanisms for MPLS-SR and SRv6,
   including extensions to IGPs and BGP to support distributed
   signaling.  In addition, BGP-LS and BGP route reflectors could be
   added for a hybrid solution.

   A possible mostly centralized hybrid approach could be to use a PCE-
   CC to push paths represented by SID lists while using BGP-LS to
   collect network topology and link state information.  An IGP is used
   for the usual link state flooding in order to establish adjacencies,
   but not for DetNet flow path calculations, only for best effort
   traffic as usual.

   A similar approach for network slicing that could be leveraged for
   DetNet is described in [I-D.dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn].

   Also, note that SR cannot currently support DetNet PREOF
   functionality without extensions.  One possible approach could be to
   combine SR with BIER-TE, as discussed in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].

5.  Management Plane Overview

   The Management Plane includes the ability to statically provision
   network nodes and to use OAM to monitor DetNet performance and detect
   outages or other issues at the DetNet layer.

5.1.  Provisioning

   Static provisioning in a Detnet network will be performed via the use
   of appropriate YANG models, including [I-D.ietf-detnet-yang] and
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-topology-yang].

5.2.  DetNet Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)

   The overall framework and requirements for DetNet OAM are discussed
   in [I-D.mirsky-detnet-oam].  This document currently includes
   additional OAM details that may eventually be merged into that
   document.

5.2.1.  OAM for Performance Monitoring (PM)

5.2.1.1.  Active PM

   Active PM is performed by injecting OAM packets into the network to
   estimate the performance of the network by measuring the performance
   of the OAM packets.  Adding extra traffic can affect the delay and
   throughput performance of the network, and for this reason active PM

Internet-Draft           DetNet Controller Plane               July 2019


   is not recommended for use in operational DetNet domains.  However,
   it is a useful test tool when commissioning a new network.

5.2.1.2.  Passive PM

   Passive PM monitors the actual service traffic in a network domain in
   order to measure its performance without having a detrimental affect
   on the network.  As compared to Active PM, Passive PM is much
   preferred for use in DetNet domains.

   A proposal for DetNet passive performance measurement is contained in
   [I-D.chen-detnet-loss-delay].

5.2.2.  OAM for Fault/Defect Management (FM)

   [I-D.mirsky-detnet-oam] contains requirements for fault/defect
   detection and management in a DetNet domain.

   The overall security considerations of DetNet are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  For
   DetNet networks that make use of Segment Routing (whether SR-MPLS or
   SRv6), the security considerations in [RFC8402] also apply.

   DetNet networks that make use of a centralized controller plane may
   be threatened by the loss of connectivity (whether accidental or
   malicious) between the central controller and the network nodes, and/
   or the spoofing of control messages from the controller to the
   network nodes.  This is important since such networks depend on
   centralized controllers to calculate flow paths and instantiate flow
   state in the network nodes.  For networks that use both DetNet and
   Segment Routing with a centralized controller, this would also
   include the calculation of SID lists and their installation in edge/
   border routers.

   In both cases, such threats may be mitigated through redundant
   controllers, the use of authentication between the controller(s) and
   the network nodes, and other mechanisms for protection against DOS
   attacks.  A mechanism for supporting one or more alternative central

   controllers and the ability to fail over to such an alternative
   controller will be required.
