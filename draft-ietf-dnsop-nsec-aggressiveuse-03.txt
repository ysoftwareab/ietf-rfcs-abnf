                      Aggressive use of NSEC/NSEC3
                 draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse-03

Abstract

   The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup
   generally requires an exact match.  This document specifies the use
   of NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to allow DNSSEC validating resolvers
   to generate negative answers within a range.  This increases
   performance / decreases latency, decreases resource utilization on
   both authoritative and recursive servers, and also increases privacy.
   It may also help increase resilience to certain DoS attacks in some
   circumstances.

   This document updates RFC4035 by allowing validating resolvers to
   generate negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records.

1.  Introduction

   A DNS negative cache exists, and is used to cache the fact that a
   name does not exist.  This method of negative caching requires exact
   matching; this leads to unnecessary additional lookups, increases

   latency, leads to extra resource utilization on both authoritative
   and recursive servers, and decreases privacy by leaking queries.

   This document updates RFC 4035 to allow recursive resolvers to use
   NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to synthetize negative answers from the
   information they have in the cache.  This allows validating resolvers
   to respond with NXDOMAIN immediately if the name in question falls
   into a range expressed by a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record already in the
   cache.

   Aggressive Negative Caching was first proposed in Section 6 of DNSSEC
   Lookaside Validation (DLV) [RFC5074] in order to find covering NSEC
   records efficiently.

   Section 3 of [I-D.vixie-dnsext-resimprove] "Stopping Downward Cache
   Search on NXDOMAIN" and [I-D.ietf-dnsop-nxdomain-cut] proposed
   another approach to use NXDOMAIN information effectively.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Many of the specialized terms used in this document are defined in
   DNS Terminology [RFC7719].

   The key words "Closest Encloser" and "Source of Synthesis" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC4592].

   "Closest Encloser" is also defined in NSEC3 [RFC5155], as is "Next
   closer name".

3.  Problem Statement

   The DNS negative cache caches negative (non-existent) information,
   and requires an exact match in most instances [RFC2308].

   Assume that the (DNSSEC signed) "example.com" zone contains:

      apple.example.com IN A 192.0.2.1

      elephant.example.com IN A 192.0.2.2

      zebra.example.com IN A 192.0.2.3

   If a validating resolver gets a query for cat.example.com, it will
   query the example.com servers and will get back an NSEC (or NSEC3)



Fujiwara, et al.          Expires April 7, 2017                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                October 2016


   record starting that there are no records between apple and elephant.
   The resolver then knows that cat.example.com does not exist; however,
   it does not use the fact that the proof covers a range (apple to
   elephant) to suppress queries for other labels that fall within this
   range.  This means that if the validating resolver gets a query for
   ball.example.com (or dog.example.com) it will once again go off and
   query the example.com servers for these names.

   Apart from wasting bandwidth, this also wastes resources on the
   recursive server (it needs to keep state for outstanding queries),
   wastes resources on the authoritative server (it has to answer
   additional questions), increases latency (the end user has to wait
   longer than necessary to get back an NXDOMAIN answer), can be used by
   attackers to cause a DoS (see additional resources), and also has
   privacy implications (e.g: typos leak out further than necessary).

4.  Background

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] and [RFC5155] both provide "authenticated denial of
   existence"; this is a cryptographic proof that the queried for name
   does not exist, accomplished by providing a (DNSSEC secured) record
   containing the names which appear alphabetically before and after the
   queried for name.  In the example above, if the (DNSSEC validating)
   recursive server were to query for lion.example.com it would receive
   a (signed) NSEC/NSEC3 record stating that there are no labels between
   "elephant" and "zebra".  This is a signed, cryptographic proof that
   these names are the ones before and after the queried for label.  As
   lion.example.com falls within this range, the recursive server knows
   that lion.example.com really does not exist.  This document specifies
   that this NSEC/NSEC3 record should be used to generate negative
   answers for any queries that the recursive server receives that fall
   within the range covered by the record (for the TTL for the record).

   Section 4.5 of [RFC4035] says:

   "In theory, a resolver could use wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate
   positive and negative responses (respectively) until the TTL or
   signatures on the records in question expire.  However, it seems
   prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking new authoritative data or
   synthesizing new data on their own.  Resolvers that follow this
   recommendation will have a more consistent view of the namespace."
   and "The reason for these recommendations is that, between the
   initial query and the expiration of the data from the cache, the
   authoritative data might have been changed (for example, via dynamic
   update).".  In other words, if a resolver generates negative answers
   from an NSEC record, it will not send any queries for names within
   that NSEC range (for the TTL).  If a new name is added to the zone
   during this interval the resolver will not know this.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                October 2016


   We believe this recommendation can be relaxed because, in the absense
   of this technique, a lookup for the exact name could have come in
   during this interval, and so this could already be cached (see
   [RFC2308] for more background).  This means that zone operators
   should have no expectation that an added name would work immediately.
   With DNSSEC and Aggressive NSEC, the TTL of the NSEC record is the
   authoritative statement of how quickly a name can start working
   within a zone.

5.  Aggressive Negative Caching

   Section 4.5 of [RFC4035] shows that "In theory, a resolver could use
   wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate positive and negative responses
   (respectively) until the TTL or signatures on the records in question
   expire.  However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking
   new authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own.
   Resolvers that follow this recommendation will have a more consistent
   view of the namespace".

   This document relaxes this this restriction, as follows:

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Once the records are validated, DNSSEC enabled validating    |
   | resolvers SHOULD use NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate |
   | negative responses until their effective TTLs or signatures  |
   | for those records expire.                                    |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------+

   If the validating resolver's cache has sufficient information to
   validate the query, the resolver SHOULD use NSEC/NSEC3/wildcard
   records aggressively.  Otherwise, it MUST fall back to send the query
   to the authoritative DNS servers.

   If the query name has the matching NSEC/NSEC3 RR proving the
   information requested does not exist, the validating resolver may
   respond with a NODATA (empty) answer.

5.1.  NSEC

   Implementations which support aggressive use of NSEC SHOULD enable
   this by default.  Implementations MAY provide a configuration switch
   to disable aggressive use of NSEC and allow it to be enabled or
   disabled per domain.

   The validating resolver needs to check the existence of an NSEC RR
   matching/covering the source of synthesis and an NSEC RR covering the
   query name.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                October 2016


   If the validating resolver's cache contains an NSEC RR covering the
   source of synthesis and the covering NSEC RR of the query name, the
   validating resolver may respond with NXDOMAIN error immediately.

5.2.  NSEC3

   NSEC3 aggressive negative caching is more difficult.  If the zone is
   signed with NSEC3, the validating resolver needs to check the
   existence of non-terminals and wildcards which derive from query
   names.

   If the validating resolver's cache contains an NSEC3 RR matching the
   closest encloser, an NSEC3 RR covering the next closer name, and an
   NSEC3 RR covering the source of synthesis, it is possible for the
   validating resolver to respond with NXDOMAIN immediately.

   If a covering NSEC3 RR has Opt-Out flag, the covering NSEC3 RR does
   not prove the non-existence of the domain name and the aggressive
   negative caching is not possible for the domain name.

   A validating resolver implementation MAY support aggressive use of
   NSEC3.  If it does aggressive use of NSEC3, it MAY provide a
   configuration switch to disable aggressive use of NSEC3 and allow it
   to be enabled or disabled for specific zones.

5.3.  Consideration on TTL

   The TTL value of negative information is especially important,
   because newly added domain names cannot be used while the negative
   information is effective.  Section 5 of RFC 2308 states that the
   maximum number of negative cache TTL value is 3 hours (10800).  It is
   RECOMMENDED that validating resolvers limit the maximum effective TTL
   value of negative responses (NSEC/NSEC3 RRs) to this same value.

6.  Benefits

   The techniques described in this document provide a number of
   benefits, including (in no specific order):

   Reduced latency  By answering directly from cache, validating
      resolvers can immediately inform clients that the name they are
      looking for does not exist, improving the user experience.

   Decreased recursive server load  By answering negative queries from
      the cache, validating servers avoid having send a query and wait
      for a response.  In addition to decreasing the bandwidth used, it
      also means that the server does not need to allocate and maintain
      state, thereby decreasing memory and CPU load.



Fujiwara, et al.          Expires April 7, 2017                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                October 2016


   Decreased authorative server load  Because recursive servers can
      answer (negative) queries without asking the authoritative server,
      the authoritative servers receive less queries.  This decreases
      the authoritative server bandwidth, queries per second and CPU
      utilization.

   The scale of the benefit depends upon multiple factors, including the
   query distribution.  For example, currently around 65% of queries to
   Root Name servers result in NXDOMAIN responses; this technique will
   eliminate a sizable quantity of these.

   The technique described in this document may also mitigate so-called
   "random QNAME attacks", in which attackers send many queries for
   random sub-domains to resolvers.  As the resolver will not have the
   answers cached it has to ask external servers for each random query,
   leading to a DoS on the authoritative servers (and often resolvers).
   Aggressive NSEC may help mitigate these attacks by allowing the
   resolver to answer directly from cache for any random queries which
   fall within already requested ranges.  It will not always work as an
   effective defense, not least because not many zones are DNSSEC signed
   at all, but it will still provide an additional layer of defense.

7.  Update to RFC 4035

   Section 4.5 of [RFC4035] shows that "In theory, a resolver could use
   wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate positive and negative responses
   (respectively) until the TTL or signatures on the records in question
   expire.  However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking
   new authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own.
   Resolvers that follow this recommendation will have a more consistent
   view of the namespace".

   The paragraph is updated as follows:

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Once the records are validated, DNSSEC enabled validating   |
   |  resolvers MAY use wildcards and NSEC/NSEC3 resource records |
   |  to generate negative responses until their effective TTLs   |
   |  or signatures for those records expire.                     |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------+

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   Newly registered resource records may not be used immediately.
   However, choosing suitable TTL value and negative cache TTL value
   (SOA MINIMUM field) will mitigate the delay concern, and it is not a
   security problem.

   It is also suggested to limit the maximum TTL value of NSEC / NSEC3
   resource records in the negative cache to, for example, 10800 seconds
   (3hrs), to mitigate this issue.  Implementations which comply with
   this proposal are recommended to have a configurable maximum value of
   NSEC RRs in the negative cache.

   Aggressive use of NSEC / NSEC3 resource records without DNSSEC
   validation may create serious security issues, and so this technique
   requires DNSSEC validation.

10.  Implementation Status

   Unbound currenty implements aggressive negative caching, as does
   Google Public DNS.

Appendix A.  Detailed implementation notes

   o  Previously, cached negative responses were indexed by QNAME,
      QCLASS, QTYPE, and the setting of the CD bit (see RFC 4035,
      Section 4.7), and only queries matching the index key would be
      answered from the cache.  With aggressive negative caching, the
      validator, in addition to checking to see if the answer is in its
      cache before sending a query, checks to see whether any cached and
      validated NSEC record denies the existence of the sought
      record(s).  Using aggressive negative caching, a validator will
      not make queries for any name covered by a cached and validated
      NSEC record.  Furthermore, a validator answering queries from
      clients will synthesize a negative answer whenever it has an
      applicable validated NSEC in its cache unless the CD bit was set
      on the incoming query.  (Imported from Section 6 of [RFC5074]).

   o  Implementing aggressive negative caching suggests that a validator
      will need to build an ordered data structure of NSEC and NSEC3
      records for each signer domain name of NSEC / NSEC3 records in
      order to efficiently find covering NSEC / NSEC3 records.  Call the
      table as NSEC_TABLE.  (Imported from Section 6.1 of [RFC5074] and
      expanded.)

   o  The aggressive negative caching may be inserted at the cache
      lookup part of the recursive resolvers.

   o  If errors happen in aggressive negative caching algorithm,
      resolvers MUST fall back to resolve the query as usual.  "Resolve
      the query as usual" means that the resolver must process the query
      as though it does not implement aggressive negative caching.
