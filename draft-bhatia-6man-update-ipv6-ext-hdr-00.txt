   Abstract 

      In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in 
      separate headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and 
      the upper-layer header in a packet.  There are a small number of 
      such extension headers, each identified by a distinct Next 
      Header value. However, it presents no backward compatible way 
      for incrementally introducing new IPv6 extension headers inside 
      the network.  

      Additionally since there is no standard format for extension 
      headers, it becomes impossible for intermediaries that want to 
      deep inspect the packet to parse an incoming packet which 
      carries an extension header that it does not recognize. 

      This document attempts to standardize the IPv6 extension header 
      format to fix these issues.

   1. Problem Definition 

      The IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines extension headers that can 
      be used to encode optional internet layer information and are 
      placed between the IPv6 main header and the upper-layer header 
      of the packet. This helps in improving forwarding performance as 
      the intermediate routers only look at the IPv6 main header and 
      dont process the extension headers treating them as part of the 
      packet payload.

      The architecture is very flexible for developing new extension 
      headers for future uses as needed. New extension headers 
      [RFC3775] can be defined and used without changing the IPv6 main 
      header. 
       
      [RFC2460] allows us to chain multiple extension headers by using 
      the Next Header field. The Next Header field indicates to the 
      router which extension header to expect next. If there are no 
      more extension headers, the next header field indicates the 
      upper layer header (TCP, UDP, etc). 
       
      [RFC2460] further states that an end node that comes across an 
      unrecognized Next Header should discard that packet and send an 
      ICMP Parameter Problem message to the source of the packet, with 
      an ICMP code value of 1 ("unrecognized Next Header type 
      encountered") and the ICMP Pointer field containing the offset 
      of the unrecognized value within the original packet. 
       
      This creates a problem in incrementally introducing new IPv6 
      extension headers inside the network as all routers need to get 
      upgraded at the same time so that they don't discard packets. 
      This is cumbersome and is not always possible. 
       
      Another problem that exists is that if new extension headers are 
      defined, and if an intermediate device that wants to deep 
      inspect the packets is not aware of these extension headers, 
      then it may not be able to process the packet as it will not 
      know where the new unknown extension header ends and the next 
      one begins. 
       
      This document proposes to standardize the IPv6 extension header 
      format for fixing the above mentioned issues. 
    

   2. Standard IPv6 Extension Header Format 

      All IPv6 Extension Headers should have the format as described 
      in the following figure:

      Next Header 
       
      8 bit selector that identifies the type of header immediately

      8-bit selector that indicates the length in 8 octet units of the 
      extension header, not including the first 8 octets. 
       
      Hdr Options 
       
      8-bit selector where the highest two bits specify the action 
      that must be taken if the processing IPv6 node does not 
      recognize the extension header: 
       
      00   skip over this option and continue processing the header.

      10   discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the 
           packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send  
           an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 1, message to the packet's 
           Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized value within 
           the original packet. 
       
      11   discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination 
           Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP  
           parameter Problem, Code 1, message to the packet's Source  
           Address, pointing to the unrecognized value within 
           the original packet.

   3. Incremental Deployments    

      New extension headers can set the highest order bits in the 
      Header Options of the extension header to 00 so that the end 
      node can still process the original packet. This will obviously 
      only help if the end node can still function without being able 
      to understand the new extension header. An example of this is 
      [karp-non-ipsec-ospfv3-auth]. 
       
   4. Intermediary Nodes   

      Intermediaries that cannot recognize the new extension header 
      can look at the length of the extension header and skip as many 
      bytes and continue with the remaining packet if it so desires. 
      Additionally it MAY look at the Header Options and decide if it 
      wants to pass/drop the packet. 
       
   5. Security Considerations 

      This document introduces no new security threat that already 
      exists. 
       
       
   6. IANA Considerations 

      This document requires no action from IANA.
