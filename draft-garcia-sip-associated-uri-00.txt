Abstract

   This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of a
   P-Associated-URI header. A UAC registers a URI to a registrar. Then
   the registrar informs the UAC of the associated URIs to its registered
   URI. This information is conveyed in the P-Associated-URI header,
   carried in a 200 OK response to a REGISTER request.

1. Introduction

   A UAC registers a SIP or SIPS URI to a registrar. The registrar may be
   aware of one or more associated SIP or SIPS URIs to the registered
   one. The registrar considers the associated URIs alias of the
   registered one.

   A subscriber typically is assigned with one or more URIs. This may be
   in the form of a SIP or SIPS URI. Typically a user will group some of
   this URIs, so that when one of them registers, the other are
   automatically associated at the registrar, and the user is allowed to
   insert any of them into the From header of any request. The effect is
   that the associated URIs are aliases of the registered URI.

2. Applicability statement

   The P-Associated-URI is applicable whenever the following
   circumstances are met:

        1. The UAC sends a REGISTER message in order to register a URI.
        2. The user has one or more URIs associated to the one that is
           registering.
        3. The registrar wants to inform the user of the other
           associated URIs.

3. The Associated URI header

   The registrar inserts the P-Associated-URI header into the 200 OK
   response to a REGISTER request. The header is populated with a list of
   URIs that are associated to the registered URI.

   If the registrar supports the P-Associated-URI header, it always
   insert it in a 200 OK response to a REGISTER request, no matter
   whether the REGISTER was an initial registration, re-registration, or
   de-registration.

4. Syntax and definition

  Garcia           The SIP Associated URL header              April 2002

   The P-Associated-URI is a SIP extension header. The syntax of the P-
   Associated-URI header is based on the ABNF of SIP [1] and its syntax
   is described as follows:

   P-Associated-URI = "P-Associated-URI" HCOLON addr-spec
                       *(COMMA addr-spec)

   A P-Associated-URI header may be inserted into a 200 OK response for a
   REGISTER request.

   The allowable usage of headers is described in Table 2 of SIP [1]. The
   following additions to this table are needed for the P-Associated-URI
   header.

   Addition of P-Associated-URI to SIP Table 2:

   Header field        where   proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRA SUB NOT
   _____________________________________________________________________
   P-Associated-URI     200      -    -   -   -   -   -   o   -   -   -

5. Usage

5.1 Procedures at the UA

   A UAC may receive a P-Associated-URI header in the 200 OK response for
   a REGISTER. The header contains a list of associated URIs. The UAC can
   use any of the associated URIs to populate the From header field in a
   subsequent dialog.

5.2 Procedures at the registrar

   A registrar that receives and authorizes a REGISTER request, may
   automatically associate one or more URIs with the registered URI. The
   registrar, includes a P-Associated-URI header in the 200 OK response,
   and populates it with the list of associated URIs to the registered
   request.

5.3 Procedures at the proxy

   This memo does not define any procedures at the proxy.

6. Security Considerations

   The information returned in the header is not viewed as particularly
   sensitive. Rather, it is simply informational in nature, providing
   openness to the UE with regard to the automatic association performed
   by the registrar. If end-to-end protection is not used at the SIP
   layer, it is possible for proxies between the registrar and the UA to
   modify the contents of the header. This attack, while potentially
   annoying, should not have significant impacts.

7. IANA Considerations

  Garcia           The SIP Associated URL header              April 2002


   This document defines the SIP extension header "P-Associated-URI"
   which should be included in the registry of SIP headers defined in SIP
   [1]. As required by the SIP change process [3] the SIP extension
   header name "Associated-URI" should also be registered in association
   with this extension.
