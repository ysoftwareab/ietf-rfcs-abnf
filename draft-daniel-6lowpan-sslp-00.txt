Internet-Draft              SSLP for 6LoWPAN                   July 2005


1.  Introduction

   6LoWPAN stands for IPv6 layer over low-power wireless personal area
   networks (LoWPAN) which consist of devices that conform to the IEEE
   802.15.4-2003 standard [ieee802.15.4].  IEEE 802.15.4 devices are
   used to provide services like home security, fire alarm, medical
   sensing/monitoring, heating control, and building automation, etc.
   When clients want to use services without configuration, a service
   discovery mechanism is needed.

   In IP networks, the Service Location Protocol(SLP) is used for access
   to information about the existence, location, and configuration of
   networked services [RFC2608].  SLP is well operating in IP networks,
   but there are several issues to be solved [I-D.kushalnagar-lowpan-
   goals-assumptions] to apply it to 6LoWPAN.  The limited packet size
   of 6LoWPANs is one of them; Given that in the worst case the maximum
   size available for transmitting IP packets over IEEE 802.15.4 frame
   is 81 octets, and that the IPv6 header is 40 octets long, (without
   optional headers), this leaves only 41 octets for upper-layer
   protocols, like UDP and TCP.  UDP uses 8 octets in the header,
   thereby leaving 33 octets for data, like SLP, over UDP.  However, the
   SLP message could easily be greater than this remaining octets, and
   it should be transmitted as multiple packets, causing traffic
   overheads to 6LoWPAN.

   [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4] introduces the adaption
   layer of fragmentation and reassembly  for IPv6 packets, while
   providing a header compression scheme for reducing the size of the
   IPv6 header.  Also,  it expects that 6LoWPAN uses mesh routing for
   the multi-hop forwarding of IPv6 packets at sub-IP layer.  This makes
   it difficult to use SLP directly, requiring to define a simple
   service discovery protcol to discover, control, and maintain services
   provided by devices in 6LoWPAN.

   This document defines the Simple Service Location Protocol(SSLP)
   which provides a framework for the discovery and selection of network
   services in 6LoWPAN.  SSLP is simple and lightweight to be
   transmitted efficiently in 6LoWPAN.  SSLP in 6LoWPAN could also
   interwork with SLPv2[RFC2608] in external IP networks.  That is,
   clients can discover and control services in 6LoWPAN regardless of
   whether they are located inside the 6LoWPAN or not.

2.  Terminology

   Terminologies used in this document are defined in [RFC2608] as
   follows:

      User Agent (UA)
         A process working on the user's behalf to establish contact
         with some service.  The UA retrieves service information from
         the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA)
         A process working on the behalf of one or more services to
         advertise the services.

      Directory Agent (DA)
         A process which collects service advertisements.

      Service Type
         Each type of service has a unique Service Type string.

      Naming Authority
         The agency or group which catalogs given Service Types and
         Attributes.  The default Naming Authority is IANA.

      Scope
         A set of services, typically making up a logical administrative
         group.

      URL
         A Universal Resource Locator [RFC2396].


   Translation Agent(TA) is newly defined in this document for
   interworking with SLPv2 in IP networks.

      Translation Agent(TA)
         A process is working on a device which has interfaces to both
         IP networks and 6LoWPAN.  TA translates SLPv2 messages into
         SSLP messages, and vice versa.


2.1  Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

      Syntax
         Syntax for string based protocols follow the conventions
         defined for ABNF [RFC2234].

      Strings
         All strings are encoded using the UTF-8 [RFC3629]
         transformation of the Unicode character set and are NOT null
         terminated when transmitted.  Strings are preceded by a two
         byte length field.

      <string-list>
         A comma delimited list of strings with the following syntax:

         string-list = string / string `,' string-list


   In format diagrams, any field ending with a \ indicates a variable
   length field, given by a prior length field in the protocol.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The Simple Service Location Protocol (SSLP) supports the same
   framework as SLP in which client applications are modeled as 'User
   Agents' (UAs), and services are advertised by 'Service Agents' (SAs).
   The 'Directory Agent' (DA) functions as a cache of the information
   about services registered by SAs and informs UAs of the existence of
   services.  Besides, SSLP introduces 'Translation Agents' which
   perform the translation of messages (which are defined in Section 5)
   for the interoperability with SLPv2.

   The role of UA, SA, and DA in SSLP is not quite different from the
   ones in SLP.  The UA issues a 'Service Request' (SREQ) on behalf of
   the client application, specifying the characteristics of the service
   which the client requires.  The UA will receive a 'Service Reply'
   (SREP) specifying the location of all services in the 6LoWPAN which
   satisfy the request.

   SSLP allows both the two-party and three-party service discovery
   mechanisms.  In the two-party discovery, the UA directly issues SREQ
   to SAs.  This mechanism is useful for a small-sized 6LoWPAN because
   it doesn't require the configuration of DAs.  In this case, the UA
   broadcasts (or multicasting if possible) a SREQ to the entire 6LoWPAN
   to which it belongs using the link layer broadcasting scheme.  The
   use of multicasting for service request is TBD if a multicasting
   mechanism is supported in the 6LoWPAN in the future.

   In the three-party discovery, one or more DAs are employed in order
   to reduce the broadcasting overheads of service requests especially
   for a large 6LoWPAN.  SAs send a 'Service Registration' (SREG)
   containing all the services they advertise to DAs and receive
   'Service Acknowledgement' (SACK) in reply.  These advertisements must
   be refreshed with the DA or they expire.  UAs unicast SREQ to DAs



Kim, et al.             Expires January 10, 2006                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              SSLP for 6LoWPAN                   July 2005


   instead of SAs if any DAs are known.  The discovery of DAs and DA
   advertisements are TBD.

   Services are grouped together using 'scopes'.  These are strings
   which identify services by location, administrative grouping,
   proximity in a network topology or some other category.

   +--------+ <-SSLP message-+-----------+ <-SLPv2 message-+--------+
           Figure 1: The operation of Translation Agent(TA)


   The 'Translation Agent' (TA) must work on a machine which reaches
   both a IP network and a 6LoWPAN.  If a TA receives either a SLP
   message from a IP network or a SSLP message from a 6LoWPAN, it should
   perform certain translation operation to make the messages
   recognizable to the agents in the other network.  This operation is
   essentially needed for SSLP to be interoperable with SLP and vice
   versa.  With the TA, a UA can discover and control services in
   6LoWPAN regardless of whether they are located inside the 6LoWPAN or
   not.

4.  Transmission and Fragmentation Mechanism for SSLP packets in 6LoWPAN

   All SSLP packets transported over IEEE 802.15.4 are prefixed by an
   encapsulation header defined in [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-
   802.15.4].  Also, all SSLP packets are transmitted and fragmented by
   the mechanism discussed in [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-
   802.15.4].  This section summarizes the transmission and
   fragmentation mechanism of [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4]
   for SSLP packets.

   SSLP packets are prefixed by an encapsulation header with one of the
   formats illustrated below.

   NOTE: All fields marked "reserved" or "rsv" SHALL be zero.

       Figure 4: Subsequent fragment(s) encapsulation header format

   Fields are defined in [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4] as
   follows:

   LF specifies the relative position of the link fragment within the
   SSLP packet, as encoded by the following table.

                00      Unfragmented         (Figure 2)

                11      Interior Fragment    (Figure 4)

   The value of prot_type for SSLP is assigned via IANA under the policy
   of "Specification Required" [RFC2434].

   M bit is used to signal whether there is a "Final Destination" field
   as used for ad hoc or mesh routing.  If set to 1, a "Final
   Destination" field precedes the SSLP packet.  M bit is set to 1 when
   the unicast SSLP packet is transmitted.

   The datagram_label, datagram_offset, and datagram_size are used only
   when the packet is fragmented.  These fields are specifically
   descripted in [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4].

   The "Final Destination" field is defined in [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-
   ipv6-over-802.15.4] as follows:

                        1                   2                   3

       Figure 5: Final destination field format

   S bit SHALL be zero.  [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4]
   describes that this field is used to signal the use of a short 16 bit
   address instead of the default IEEE extended 64 bit address format in
   their future revisions.

   The hops left SHALL be decremented by each forwarding node before
   sending this packet towards its next hop.  The packet is discarded if
   Hops Left is decremented to zero.

   The address of final destination is the final destination's link-
   layer address.  [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4] assumes
   that this field is 64 bits long, but a future revision may add
   support for short addresses (16 bits).

5.  Simple Service Location Protocol(SSLP) Messages

   All SSLP messages begin with the following header:

                        1                   2                   3

   SREG, SACK, and SADV.  For UAs and SAs, to support for other messages
   is OPTIONAL.

   O and F bit are compatible with the flag field in SLPv2 and defined
   in [RFC2608].  OVERFLOW is set when a message's length exceeds what
   can fit into a datagram.  FRESH is set on every new SREG.

   The sequence number is set to a unique value for each unique SREQ
   message.  If the request message is retransmitted, the same sequence
   number is used.  Replies set the sequence number to the same value as
   the sequence number in the SREQ message.  This field is compatible
   with XID field in SLPv2.

       11      128 bit IPv6 address is used as Source Address field

   If <scope-list> field is omitted, length of <scope-list> field MUST
   be set to zero and all services matching <service-type> are
   discovered independent of <scope-list>.

   The <service-type> field consists of service type strings.  Service
   Types SHOULD be defined by a "Service Template" [RFC2609], which
   provides expected attributes, values and protocol behavior.

   SREQ messages are broadcasted over 6LoWPAN.  SAs MUST broadcast this
   message whether they have the services matching service-type or not.

   In the absence of DAs, SREQ messages are broadcasted over 6LoWPAN.
   In this case, M bit is set to 0 in the encapsulation header.  SAs
   MUST broadcast this message whether they have matching service or
   not.

   In the presence of one or more DAs, UAs unicast SREQ messages to
   them.  In this case, M bit is set to 1 in the encapsulation header
   for a SREQ.  DAs MUST issue SREP messages in response to SREQ
   messages whether they know the service location UAs inquire or not.

       Figure 8: SSLP service reply message header format

   For SREP messages, M bit MUST be set to 1 in encapsulation header.
   As [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-802.15.4], final destination
   field is used when M bit is set to 1.

   SREP message contains zero or more service location entries.  If no
   matching service locations are present in SAs or DAs, the SREP
   message with zero service location entries is returned in response to
   a unicast SREQ message.  However, a SREP message with zero service
   location entries MUST NOT be sent in response to a broadcast SREQ
   message.

   The service location entry is defined as follows.

                        1                   2                   3

       Value   Meaning

       01      16 bit short address is used as Service Location field
       10      64 bit extended address is used as Service Location field
       11      URL Location field is used as Service Location field

   If LT field has the value of 11, Service Location field is replaced
   by the URL Location field defined as follows.

                        1                   2                   3

5.3  Service Registration Message

   SREG messages are used only when DAs exist.  SAs MUST register their
   services to DAs.(TBD)

5.4  Service Acknowledgment Message

   SACK messages are received in response to the SREG messages.(TBD)

5.5  Service Deregistration Message

   SDER messages are sent to DAs when SAs does not provide their
   services any more.(TBD)

5.6  Directory Agent Advertisement Message

   A DADV message is sent when a DA receives a SREQ message with service
   type of "service: directory-agent".(TBD)

5.7  Service Agent Advertisement Message

   A SADV message is sent when a SA receives a SREQ message with service
   type of "service: service-agent".(TBD)

6.  Interoperability

   SSLP interoperates with SLPv2 via Translation Agent (TA).  A TA MUST
   be capable of the translation between SLPv2 and SSLP.  In other
   words, TA translates SLPv2 messages into SSLP messages, and vice
   versa.  Future revisions will define the operation of a TA in detail.

7.  IANA Consideration

   The prot_type field is defined in [I-D.montenegro-lowpan-ipv6-over-
   802.15.4].  The assignment of prot_type value for SSLP is to be
   coordinated via IANA under the policy of "Specification Required"
   [RFC2434].

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the [RFC3111] are applicable to this
   document.  Especially, Translation Agent (TA) MUST be secured for
   processing SSLP/SLP messages translation and specific considerations
   will be carefully studied in the next version.
