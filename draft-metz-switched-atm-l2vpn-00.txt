     Abstract 
      
     Many providers operate ATM networks that support a suite of network 
     services. These networks employ ATM signaling and routing protocols to 
     expedite connection setup and recovery. Over time these providers will 
     migrate all or portions of their ATM infrastructure and services to an 
     IP/MPLS-based Packet Switched Network (PSN) thus leading to the 
     creation of ATM L2VPNs. This document describes a solution that 
     supports dynamic signaling and routing of point-to-point switched ATM 
     connections (i.e. VP or VC) across an IP/MPLS network. It is based on 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                                    [Page 1] 
                                         

     the L2VPN (VPWS) architecture which employs an {attachment circuit, PE, 
     pseudo-wire, PE, attachment circuit} tuple to define a distinct point-
     to-point L2 connection between two end-points within the VPN [PPVPN 
     L2]. The presumption is that the L2 connection is a switched ATM VC or 
     VP and that one or both ACs and the PW are established in real-time 
     using routing and signaling protocol machinery native to the ATM and 
     IP/MPLS networks. We call this a switched ATM L2VPN. 
      
     The key component of a switched ATM L2VPN is a PWE3 native service 
     processing (NSP) function on the PE that serves as an interworking 
     gateway between native ATM and IP/MPLS signaling and routing protocols. 
     The NSP learns of ATM prefixes reachable through the local attachment 
     circuits. The ATM prefixes are exchanged with a co-resident MP-BGP 
     instance for automatic distribution and discovery of ATM reachability 
     to participating PEs and their directly-attached ATM networks. The NSP 
     is capable of processing the necessary native ATM signaling messages 
     for real-time connection management. The NSP interacts with the co-
     resident PWE3 signaling machinery for concurrent PW connection 
     management. Extensions to the PWE3 signaling protocol are required to 
     support dynamic single-sided provisioning and to transport ATM 
     signaling parameters between the NSPs for connection management 
     purposes. Extensions to the MP-BGP protocol are needed distribute ATM 
     prefixes and associated next hop information between PEs.

     1. Introduction 
      
     Providers with ATM networks are looking to move native ATM traffic and 
     services onto a single IP/MPLS PSN. This consolidation will occur for a 
     number of reasons including expansion into new markets (e.g. long 
     distance data) via regulatory relief, the need to reduce capital and 
     operational expenditures (capex and opex) and a desire to converge on a 
     single network technology that can accommodate current L2 services as 
     well as emerging and future L3 packet services. 
      
     Providers are already offering L3VPN services over their PSNs based on 
     a variety of techniques [PPVPN L3]. Likewise there is strong interest 
     in developing solutions that can support L2-based services over the 
     same PSN infrastructure [PPVPN L2]. It is envisioned that over time the 
     PSN will be capable of supporting the same per-customer L2 connection 
     networks (e.g. frame relay, ATM, ethernet) that currently run over 
     separate, switched infrastructures.   
      
     An L2VPN provides emulated L2 LAN or WAN services over a packet 
     switched network (PSN). The backbone of an L2VPN is composed of an IP 
     or MPLS-based PSN with provider edge (PE) and core provider (P) nodes. 
     An L2VPN relies on PWE3 signaling protocols to build and manage inter-
     PE PWs and IP routing protocols to forward PW-encapsulated L2 PDUs from 
     the ingress PE, across the PSN to the egress PE. [PWE3 Control] is an 
     example of a PWE3 signaling protocol.             
      
     Currently and for the foreseeable future, a big part of the provider∆s 
     ATM operations involves the use of connection provisioning systems that 
     rely on proprietary or standard connection routing and signaling 
     protocols. These protocols enable the operator to configure the two 
     end-points of the desired connection without having to touch the 
     intermediate nodes and links. Dynamic reroute during connection setup 
     and automatic re-establishement of failed connections during recovery 
     are two important features of these protocols. The standard for 
     connection routing and signaling in ATM is PNNI [PNNISPEC]. The 
     standard for connection signaling with static routing across ATM 
     network boundaries is AINI [AINI].  
      

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                              [Page 4] 
      
                                         

     As the provider transitions to a PSN backbone, the question to ask is 
     how might ATM connection signaling and routing work through an 
     intermediate PSN? One approach is to configure and then concatenate 
     individual segments (i.e. AC, PW) of the ATM connection employing a 
     provisioning NMS of some sort. This does not require application of new 
     protocols but could be a recovery, scaling and latency problem given 
     the requirement for NMS intervention in the (re-) establishment of a 
     potentially large number of switched ATM connections. 
      
     Another approach is to pre-configure an overlay network of PWs that 
     forms a mesh of cell-bearing trunks. The PWs in this case emulate 
     inter-switch physical or VP NNI (network-network interface) trunks. All 
     ATM signaling and routing messages as well as OAM and data cells are 
     transparently tunneled through these PWs. The protocol machinery for 
     the signaling and encapsulation of ATM PWs is defined in [PWE3 ATM]. 
     The advantage of this approach is its simplicity in that it avoids the 
     potential pitfalls associated with complex interworking between control 
     planes [RFC3439]. 
      
     There are several drawbacks to such an approach. A set of PWs and 
     associated PSN tunnels must be configured a priori in a partial or full 
     mesh. Any full mesh overlay topology may introduce a possible O(N^2) 
     scaling burden if N is large. The N in this case could be applied to an 
     individual ATM switch (signaling and routing adjacencies with other ATM 
     switches) the PE (number of PWs, ACs and ports) and the provider∆s 
     network management and provisioning tools.  
      
     Second the PWs and associated PSN tunnels must be pre-configured in 
     coarse resource increments commensurate with the aggregate of the 
     expected ATM (dynamically signaled) connection load. Failure to execute 
     this traffic engineering task in a pre-emptive manner may impact the 
     service level agreements (SLA) associated with the tunneled switched 
     ATM connections. And finally an overlay network, even if it is making 
     use of a shared PSN for transport is still a separate network that 
     requires its own management and operations procedures. This may not 
     align with the provider∆s strategy for network consolidation. 
      
     A variation on the overlay model is to embed native ATM control plane 
     functions on the PE and possibly the P nodes. ATM signaling and routing 
     messages along with OAM and data cells would continue to pass 
     transparently through the PSN. In this case extensions to ATM signaling 
     protocols are needed to establish and manage the PW segment of the 
     switched ATM connection [ATM MPLS IW]. The key advantage of this 
     solution is that it retains ATM control plane homogeneity across the 
     PSN. 
      
     A drawback of this solution is that it is now ATM signaling protocols, 
     and not PWE3 protocols that are responsible for building and managing 
     the PW segment of the switched ATM connection. PWE3 protocols already 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                              [Page 5] 
      
                                         

     support the signaling and encapsulation of ATM connections. Adding yet 
     another PW signaling protocol that performs a subset of the existing 
     PWE3 protocols places an unnecessary burden on vendors who build the 
     PEs and customers who must manage them. It raises concerns regarding 
     interoperability with PWE3-supported PEs and possible unforeseen 
     interactions with PSN signaling and routing protocols.  
      
     It should also be noted that protocol extensions designed to extend the 
     applicability and manageability of L2VPNs may not work. For example 
     [L2VPN IW] defines several PWE3 protocol extensions for interworking 
     between different AC media types bound to the same PW. [PWE3 VCCV] 
     defines a method for performing connectivity verification checks on 
     PWE3-signaled PWs.    
      
     An alternative to the overlay solutions is control plane interworking 
     model. This model is realized by introducing a control plane 
     interworking function at the point of intersection between the ATM and 
     IP/MPLS networks.  Conceptually an interworking function enables the 
     PSN to utilize its native signaling and routing mechanisms in a dynamic 
     fashion to build and manage switched ATM connections that transit all 
     or a portion of the PSN. From a routing perspective the PSN is offering 
     automatic discovery and propagation of ATM reachability (i.e. ATM 
     prefixes) between ATM switches and networks connected to the PSN. This 
     is not inconsistent with existing PPVPN approaches that employ native 
     PSN routing protocols (i.e. MP-BGP) to distribute per-customer address 
     prefixes of different address families between PEs.  
      
     ATM signaling messages trigger corresponding PWE3 signaling messages at 
     the PE thus eliminating the need to pre-provision and manage coarse 
     bandwidth PWs. This portends the case where ATM signaling messages 
     could trigger a dynamic reconfiguration of aggregate PSN tunnel 
     resources sufficient to meet the SLAs of the signaled ATM connection 
     load. 
      
     One can draw upon certain PPVPN approaches such as [2547bis] to best 
     understand the advantages of the interworking approach. A customer ATM 
     network or switch (CE) need only establish a single ATM control plane 
     Ùsessionˆ with a provider PE. (Note: The terms customer and provider 
     are used here to convey the architectural similarities with existing 
     PPVPN components. The customer and provider could be part of the same 
     or separate organizations). This reduces the configuration burden on 
     existing ATM networks and switches to O(1).  
      
     Customer and provider networks are free to run their preferred flavor 
     of control plane functionality with the proviso that they agree upon a 
     common way to exchange signaling and routing information across the CE-
     PE boundary. Another advantage is that the provider is using native 
     routing and PWE3 protocol machinery (with extensions) to manage PWs 
     bearing all or portions of a switched ATM connection. This furthers the 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                              [Page 6] 
      
                                         

     practical and stated goals of providers to converge upon a single, 
     multi-service capable IP/MPLS-controlled PSN. 
      
     The key component of a switched ATM L2VPN is a PWE3 native service 
     processing (NSP) function on the PE that serves as an interworking 
     gateway between native ATM and IP/MPLS signaling and routing protocols. 
     The NSP learns about ATM prefixes reachable through local attachment 
     circuits and exchanges them with a co-resident MP-BGP instance for 
     automatic distribution (and hence discovery) of ATM reachability to 
     participating PEs and their directly-attached ATM networks. The NSP is 
     capable of processing native ATM signaling messages for real-time 
     connection management of the AC and interacts with the co-resident PWE3 
     signaling machinery for concurrent PW connection management. Extensions 
     to the PWE3 signaling protocol are required to support dynamic single-
     sided provisioning and to transport ATM signaling parameters between 
     the NSPs for connection creation, management and termination purposes. 
     Extensions to the MP-BGP protocol are employed distribute ATM prefixes 
     and associated next hop information between PEs.  
      
     The switched ATM L2VPN solution defines strict protocol boundaries 
     between the IP/MPLS and ATM networks. Complex protocol translations or 
     conversions between the two control planes are avoided while retaining 
     the end-to-end semantics of ATM signaling and routing, ATM OAM 
     procedures and ATM connection behavior. Scalable route distribution, 
     auto-discovery of PW end-points and reachable ATM prefixes along with 
     efficient signaling mechanisms are employed in the IP/MPLS network to 
     tie together separate, isolated ATM networks (and end-points) that 
     require dynamic provisioning of ATM connections between them. At a high 
     level, it can be viewed as a L2VPN supporting switched ATM-based native 
     connection services. Another view is that the L2VPN backbone is 
     offering an ATM PW exchange point service by dynamically managing the 
     exchange of ATM prefixes and signaling messages between ATM networks. 
      
     The primary advantage of this solution is that it extends the existing 
     routing (MP-BGP) and signaling (PWE3) protocol machinery already 
     operating in converged multi-service packet networks to support the 
     seamless provisioning of switched ATM connections. Again this aligns 
     with the provider∆s stated goal towards multi-service PSN convergence 
     that will ultimately lead to lower operations and capital costs.   
      
     This solution is appropriate in the following cases: 
      
       o Provider needs to connect and enable switched ATM connectivity 
          between a large number of disparate ATM networks, switches and 
          end-points that were not previously connected through a native ATM 
          infrastructure. 
           
       o Provider needs to connect and enable switched ATM connectivity           
          between various sites of multiple ATM networks, such that the 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                              [Page 7] 
      
                                         

          sites of each ATM network are interconnected, but sites in 
          different ATM networks are not allowed to connect with each other.  
           
       o Provider wishes to converge upon a unified IP/MPLS control plane 
          (i.e. IP routing, PWE3 signaling) over a single PSN for offering 
          all L3 and L2 services including switched ATM connectivity. 
           
       o Provider wishes to drive PW (and potentially PSN) tunnel creation 
          and management (using PWE3 protocols) based on ATM signaling and 
          routing. 
           
       o Provider wishes to dynamically establish a provisioned L2 
          connection where one end-point resides in a native ATM network and 
          the other is statically connected to a PE through an ATM UNI or 
          non-ATM attachment circuit. 
           
       o Provider wishes to employ a "one-to-many" model for 
          interconnecting one ATM network with many external ATM networks. 
          The "one" are the resources and work effort required to connect 
          the ATM network to a PSN; the "many" are the multiple external ATM 
          networks. This removes the need to allocate O(N) dedicated AINI 
          links when one ATM network needs to connect to N number of 
          external ATM networks. 
           
       o Provider wishes to support parallel PSN and native ATM switched 
          paths between two or more ATM networks. This might be needed 
          during an incremental ATM-to-PSN migration or perhaps the PSN 
          could serve as a low-cost backup for ATM signaling reroutes. 
          (Note: Topology exchange across the native ATM path connecting the 
          ATM networks is not permitted)    
      
     This solution may not be appropriate in the following cases: 
      
        o Provider wishes to retain the use of native ATM signaling and 
          routing mechanisms for establishing and managing switched ATM 
          connections all the way through an intermediate PSN  
           
      
     Efforts are underway in the IETF to develop solutions for L2-based 
     PPVPNs using PWE3 signaling and encapsulations as a building block. But 
     the practical case for dynamic ATM VP/VC provisioning using native ATM 
     signaling and routing protocols, as is used today (or planned) in 
     native ATM networks, and its practical interaction with L2VPNs is not 
     addressed in the current VPWS model. This document explains how this 
     can be achieved.

     2. Principle of Minimum Intervention 
      
     Any control plane interworking solution, in particular one involving 
     ATM and IP/MPLS is exposed to the complexity factor. Attempts at 
     protocol conversion or translation may not be practical or if possible 
     may lead to additional costs and high complexity. Therefore if ATM 
     signaling and routing is to be progressed through an IP/MPLS controlled 
     PSN, there should be independence of the IP/MPLS control plane and the 
     ATM control information carried within. No control plane conversion or 
     translation should be performed nor is it necessary.  
      
     This notion adheres to the Principle of Minimum Intervention where 
     Ù..the payload SHOULD be transported as received with as few 
     modifications as possible..ˆ  Further Ù..this minimum intervention 
     approach decouples payload development from PW development and requires 
     fewer translations at the NSP in a system with similar CE interfaces at 
     each end. It also prevents unwanted side-effects due to subtle 
     misrepresentation of the payload in the intermediate format..ˆ [PWE3 
     ARCH] 
       
     In applying this principle to our solution we see a requirement to 
     carry ATM routing and signaling information across the IP/MPLS network. 
     MP-BGP [MP-BGP] can distribute reachability for multiple address 
     families and thus makes an ideal candidate to propagate ATM 
     reachability across the PSN. A similar mechanism is required to 
     transport ATM signaling parameters from one end of the PW to the other. 
     The obvious candidate for this function would be the PWE3 signaling 
     protocol with a TLV field allocated for transporting un-modified ATM 
     signaling parameters. 
      
      
     3. Requirements 
      
     A number of documents have already laid out the requirements for PPVPNs 
     and L2VPNs and so will not be recounted here [PPVPN-RQMTS], [L2VPN-
     RQMTS]. Instead the requirements specific to an environment where ATM-
     based switched networks and a provider∆s PSN must cooperate to support 
     dynamic ATM connection provisioning will be discussed.  
      
     The requirements are: 
      
       o Transparency. Minimal to zero change to the provider∆s existing 
          ATM infrastructure, connection-provisioning tools, ATM network 
          topology and ATM protocols.  
           
       o Service Enablement. To the extent that shuttling ATM traffic 
          through a PSN reduces costs is most certainly beneficial to the 
          provider and perhaps even the ATM network owner. Providers need to 
          make money and the deployment of new PSN infrastructure (i.e. PEs) 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                              [Page 9] 
      
                                         

          can be justified in two ways: increasing revenue and reducing 
          costs. The latter has a limit so the solution should offer the 
          potential for creating and delivering new services.         
      
       o Scalability. The solution must be scalable and connecting ATM 
          networks to a PSN must not impose any scaling constraints or 
          impractically complex protocol behaviors. 
           
       o PSN Protocol Re-use. A PSN is driven by an IP/MPLS control plane 
          and current and emerging L2 and L3 services are all incorporating 
          elements of that control plane. Therefore it makes good sense to 
          employ these same protocol mechanisms when facilitating dynamic 
          ATM connection setup across an IP/MPLS network. In the end this 
          makes it simple and low-risk to develop and deploy while 
          contributing to interoperability  
      
       o Resource efficiency. It is important to the provider that network 
          resources are allocated in an efficient and timely manner. A 
          solution that integrates ATM and IP/MPLS must, where possible, 
          permit an efficient and non-disruptive allocation of edge and core 
          PSN resources based on ATM connection setup parameters. 
      
      
     4. Switched ATM L2VPN Solution 
      
     This section discusses several baseline protocol functions and the 
     architecture of the switched ATM L2VPN solution 
      
       4.1  Baseline Protocol Functions 
      
     There are several important baseline protocol functions that should be 
     implemented to support a switched ATM service.  
      
       o ATM prefix distribution across the PSN. ATM nodes that belong to 
          the same ATM network rely on a standard or proprietary ATM routing 
          protocol for distributing ATM prefixes (and other relevant 
          topology state information). ATM networks separated by a PSN must 
          make use of native ATM and PSN routing protocols (other means are 
          not precluded) to learn about each other∆s ATM prefixes. 
           
       o Automatic Discovery of remote PE IP addresses and reachable ATM 
          Prefixes. Signaling for switched ATM connections is routed based 
          on the destination ATM prefix. This must also apply when 
          establishing the PW segment of the switched ATM connection. An 
          auto-discovery scheme is required to provide the local PE with 
          then IP address of the remote PE and the one or more ATM prefixes 
          that are reachable through that remote PE. The local PE is then 
          able to direct the PWE3 signaling message to the correct remote PE 

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 10] 
      
                                         

          based on the destination ATM prefix. 
           
       o Identifiers for Coordination of PW Establishment. One or both ACs           
          of the {AC-PE-PW-PE-AC} tuple that emulates the switched ATM           
          connection are established using native ATM signaling protocols.           
          The L2VPN architecture supports the establishment of the PW 
          connecting the two ACs, including any identifiers needed to           
          coordinate such signaling between the two PEs (for identifying and 
          selecting forwarders). One way to do this is by assigning a unique 
          Attachment Circuit Identifier (ACI) to each AC at a PE. The ACI is 
          assigned upon creation of the AC, whether the AC is created 
          through provisioning or is created dynamically through native ATM 
          signaling. One or both ACIs can then be used to coordinate PWE3 
          signaling messages between the PEs, without requiring each end to 
          know about the other a priori.            
           
          For example, if the PW is established across an MPLS network, the           
          PW consists of two LSPs, one in each direction. Each LSP is           
          established using a separate sequence of LSP signaling messages           
          initiated by one of the PEs. These two sequences of LSP signaling           
          messages can be bound together using the ACI assigned by the 
          calling side that received the initial native ATM signaling           
          message.  
           
          It should be noted that the term "Attachment Circuit Identifier" 
          (ACI) defined in this document corresponds to the "Attachment 
          Identifier" in [LDP-ROSEN], as used for point-to-point 
          connections, and to the term "End ID" in [L2TPV3-LUO]. In all 
          cases these values are used to identify and then bind a forwarder 
          (AC-PW binding) to one or both ends of a PW.  
           
          The terms, "source ACI" and "target ACI" are used later in the 
          document to convey the context of the ACI value contained in the 
          PW message to be processed and to maintain consistency with 
          aforementioned [LDP ROSEN] amd [L2TPV3 LUO] drafts. 
           
          In addition the global uniqueness of this value allows to act as a 
          "circuit identifier" that could be useful for network management 
          purposes.         
               
       o AC Signaling Propagation. In the case where the called party           
          identified in the native ATM signaling protocol identifies an           
          ATM endpoint outside of the IP/MPLS network, the information from           

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 11] 
      
                                         

          the initial native ATM signaling message must be transported 
          across the IP/MPLS network in order to create a similar native          
          ATM signaling message used to establish the last segment of the           
          switched ATM connection (including the AC). This ensures     
          consistency of the switched ATM connection across the ATM           
          networks on both sides of the IP/MPLS network. 
           
      
       4.2  Architecture 
      
     The architecture of a switched ATM L2VPN is illustrated in figure 1.

                     Figure 1 Switched ATM L2VPN Architecture 
      
     It is based on the PWE3 architecture described in [PWE3 ARCH] augmented 
     with ATM L2VPN control plane interworking functions that make it 
     possible to dynamically support and emulate switched ATM connections. 
      
     The terms used in this architecture are aligned with PWE3 terminology. 
     The architectural components and their respective functions in the 
     context of a switched ATM L2VPN consist of the following: 
      
        o PE1 and PE2 support standard PSN routing and signaling as well as 
          PWE3 signaling and encapsulation protocols. The PEs are augmented 
          with a PW Pre-processor (PREP) consisting of a NSP and forwarder. 
          The NSP and forwarder are explained below. 
           

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 12] 
      
                                         

        o CE1 and CE2 are abstract representations of one of the following: 
          1) native ATM networks running native ATM signaling and routing 
          protocols; 2) a single ATM switch or end-system; 3) a single 
          device directly connected to the PE via statically configured 
          heterogeneous ACs such as Ethernet or frame relay.  
           
        o CE signaling are control plane messages exchanged between the CE          
          and PE for the purposes of connection establishment control and           
          maintenance. Examples of CE signaling messages that are supported 
          by this architecture include Q.2931/PNNI/AINI signaling messages. 
          Unless otherwise stated, we will use the term ATM signaling when 
          referring to CE signaling for the remainder of this document. 
           
        o CE routing are control plane messages exchanged between the CE and         
          PE for the purposes of distributing topology and reachability           
          information of the L2 protocol. Examples of CE routing messages           
          include PNNI Hellos and Topology State Packets (PTSPs). Unless           
          otherwise stated, we will use the term ATM routing when referring 
          to CE routing for the remainder of this document.  
           
          CE routing is not always present. It is possible to use static 
          routes in lieu of an ATM routing protocol. For example, ATM static 
          routes are used when the CE signaling protocol is AINI. 
             
        o NSP1 and NSP2 are native service processing functions that run on 
          PE1 and PE2 respectively. The NSP serves as the interworking 
          function between the native ATM and PSN signaling and routing 
          control planes. The NSP performs two basic roles: routing and 
          signaling. The routing function involves maintaining a local 
          database of ATM reachability information that is used for 
          forwarding (ATM and PWE3) signaling messages. (Note: This is NOT 
          USED to forward ATM traffic once the connection has been 
          established) The contents of the ATM reachability database may be 
          dynamically learned through ATM routing, statically configured or 
          imported from remote PEs via MP-BGP. The signaling function of the 
          NSP locally terminates ATM signaling and triggers PWE3 signaling 
          processes.  The signaling function will pass and receive ATM 
          signaling parameters to and from the PWE3 control channel (PWE3-
          CC) thus retaining the end-to-end semantics of ATM signaling.  
           
        o Forwarder. The forwarder binds an AC to a PW. It can be identified 
          by an ACI value.  
           
        o MP-BGP sessions are established between PEs and are used to 
          propagate ATM prefixes and IP-addressable next hop information. 
           
        o PWE3 signaling protocols [PWE3 CONTROL], [PWE3 L2TPv3] employ a 
          reliable control channel established between the local and remote 
          PEs. The control channel is used to distribute PW-specific 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 13] 
      
                                         

          information such as PW labels, PW-type and ACI values. It is 
          extended in this model to carry encapsulated ATM signaling 
          information from one NSP to the other for connection management 
          purposes.  
           
        o AC, PW and PSN tunnels are defined in [PWE3 ARCH]. It should be 
          noted that this solution is independent of the PSN type, PSN 
          tunnel signaling protocol and PWE3 signaling protocol. 
           
        o ATM cells are encapsulated in PW and PSN headers using the methods 
          defined in [PWE3 ATM].    
      
     In summary ATM signaling and routing messages are terminated and 
     processed by the NSP. ATM-specific routing information is stored 
     locally and propagated to remote PEs using MP-BGP extensions. The 
     remote PE NSP may then propagate MP-BGP-learned ATM prefixes towards 
     the directly attached CE using ATM routing protocols (i.e. PNNI). 
      
     ATM-specific signaling information (connection management related) 
     originating from the ATM source end-point is terminated and processed 
     by the NSP. ATM signaling parameters are extracted and then packaged up 
     in an AC signaling TLV for subsequent carriage across the PSN to the 
     remote PE. A lookup is performed in the local ATM reachability database 
     to resolve the destination ATM prefix with a remote IP PE address. A 
     unique ACI (source ACI) associated with this switched ATM connection is 
     generated and tentatively assigned on the AC leading back to the ATM 
     source end-point. The source ACI, target ACI and AC signaling TLV are 
     appended to the PWE3 signaling message and launched towards the remote 
     PE. The target ACI may be null (because it does not exist yet and needs 
     to established) or there may be some means (i.e. configuration policy) 
     by which the local PE writes a particular value to the target ACI 
     indicating the expected existence of a specific PW forwarder on the 
     remote PE.    
      
     The remote PE receives the PWE3 signaling message and checks whether a      
     target ACI is specified. If a target ACI is specified and it matches an 
     ACI assigned to any of the ACs on the remote PE, then the PW forwarder 
     is selected and the PW is established in the direction of the remote PE 
     to the local PE. The remote PE turns around and launches a PWE3 
     signaling message in the reverse direction back to the local PE     
     containing the received target ACI as the source ACI, and the received 
     source ACI as the target ACI. 
      
     If a null target ACI is specified in the received PWE3 signaling 
     message, then the NSP signaling process reconstitutes the original ATM 
     signaling message using the data contained in the AC signaling TLV. If 
     the ATM destination end-point (identified by the called party address 
     in the reconstituted ATM signaling message) is determined to be 
     reachable through a CE network based on the information in the ATM 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 14] 
      
                                         

     reachability database, then the remote PE chooses a local interface 
     over which to progress the ATM signaling message and launches it 
     towards the ATM destination end-point. A new ACI is tentatively 
     assigned to the remote PE AC leading towards the ATM destination end-
     point pending successful setup of the connection. This new ACI can be 
     dynamically computed by the remote PE or, the value of the source ACI 
     received in the PWE3 signaling message can be reused.  
      
     ATM signaling messages received by the remote PE from the direction of      
     the ATM destination are terminated on the remote PE NSP. If a     
     connection setup is acknowledged, then the tentative ACI is assigned on      
     the remote PE for the duration of the ATM connection. A PWE3 setup      
     message is created and launched back towards the local PE, containing     
     the source ACI (specifying the ACI assigned by the remote PE), the 
     target ACI (specifying the source ACI from the received PWE3 signaling     
     message), and the necessary ATM signaling parameters in the AC 
     signaling TLV. Note that a lookup in the ATM reachability table is not 
     required. 
      
     When the local PE receives the PWE3 setup message it checks for a match 
     between the previously assigned tentative ACI on the local PE and the 
     received target ACI to ensure they are equal. The local PE then removes 
     the Ùtentativeˆ designation of the ACI for the duration of the ATM 
     connection. The PW from the local PE to the remote PE is established. 
      
     The local NSP reconstitutes the ATM signaling message and launches it 
     towards the ATM source end-point. The switched ATM connection is now 
     established across the PSN.      
      
     Other ATM signaling messages received by either the local or remote PE 
     relating to connection state during or following setup (i.e. crankback, 
     release) will be interpreted by the NSP and the appropriate PWE3 
     signaling action will be performed. 
      
      
     5. Procedures, Functions and Extensions 
      
     This section describes procedures, functions and extensions for the 
     switched ATM L2VPN model. 
      
       5.1  ATM Prefix Learning 
      
     The NSP routing function maintains a database of ATM reachability 
     information. This database is consulted during connection setup for the 
     purpose of forwarding signaling information ingress PE-to-egress PE and 
     egress PE to ATM destination address.   
      
     The PE NSP routing function can learn of ATM reachability information 
     (i.e. ATM prefixes) through several techniques: 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 15] 
      
                                         

      
         o PNNI TSPs. The PE NSP routing function can run PNNI. In this case 
           it would form an adjacency with one or more directly attached 
           PNNI switches. The PE would exchange PNNI hellos and topology 
           state packets (TSP). The received TSPs contain information used 
           to compute paths to reachable ATM prefixes. (Note: A PE NSP DOES 
           NOT establish a PNNI adjacency with remote PEs running an NSP 
           PNNI routing function) 
            
         o MP-BGP Advertisements. The PE NSP routing function can receive 
           and import ATM prefixes and IP next hops into the ATM 
           reachability database based on established BGP-based route policy 
           procedures.  
            
         o Static Configuration. Specific ATM prefixes reachable through an 
           ATM next hop can be statically configured on the PE. Note that 
           MP-BGP automatically includes an IP next hop when an ATM prefix 
           is advertised to a remote PE.   
      
     Other techniques (i.e. Radius) for populating the ATM reachability 
     database are possible. 
      
      
       5.2  ATM Reachability Database. 
      
     The ATM reachability database is used to build a table of ATM prefixes 
     and next hop information. The next hop information may be a IP-
     addressable PE (to forward the PWE3 signaling messages towards) or it 
     could be an adjacent ATM switch (to forward ATM signaling messages 
     towards). It may also contain additional information such as PNNI nodes 
     or a route database of designated transit lists (DTL). 
      
     The internal, PE-specific procedures for maintaining the ATM 
     reachability database are left to the local implementation.  
      
         
       5.3  ATM VRF and VPN-ATM Address Family 
      
     One way to conceptualize the forwarding table derived from the ATM 
     reachability database is to define an ATM virtual/routing forwarding 
     (VRF) instance. The VRF concept is defined in [2547bis] for VPNv4 
     prefixes and is applicable to VPNv6 addresses defined in [BGP VPN 
     IPv6]. It is possible to extend this model to accommodate ATM prefixes. 
      
     The VRF concept is useful in the context of MP-BGP route distribution 
     and policies. MP-BGP defines extensions to BGP for carrying routes 
     (also referred to as network layer reachability information or NLRI) 
     for multiple address families. In this solution, a PE employs MP-BGP to 
     advertise ATM prefixes and next hops to other PEs in the VPN. This 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 16] 
      
                                         

     requires that ATM prefixes be carried in an NLRI format compatible with 
     MP-BGP. 
      
     The notion of a VPN-ATM address family is one way to accomplish this. A 
     VPN-ATM address consists of an 8-byte Route Distinguisher (RD) followed 
     by a 19-byte ATM address prefix and one byte padding. The format of the 
     RD is based on [2547bis].The notion of a VPN-ATM address family is one 
     way to accomplish this. A VPN-ATM address consists of an 8-byte Route 
     Distinguisher (RD) followed by a 20-byte ATM address. A VPN-ATM     
     address prefix can have length up to 27 bytes, i.e. the Selector field      
     is not included in VPN-ATM address prefixes. The format of the RD is 
     based on [2547bis].  
      
     The use of the RD enables MP-BGP to install two or more paths to the 
     same destination ATM prefix reachable through one or more remote PEs. 
     It also enables overlapping ATM prefixes from different customer ATM 
     networks to be treated as separate VPN-ATM addresses by the MP-BGP 
     routing system. 
      
     The advantage of the ATM VRF concept in conjunction with MP-BGP is that 
     it provides the switched ATM L2VPN provider with well-known and 
     operationally mature procedures for controlling the distribution of ATM 
     prefixes. This in turn allows the provider to control connectivity 
     between various ATM networks and nodes across the IP/MPLS network. 
       
      
       5.4  MP-BGP Extensions 
      
     The techniques for distributing ÙVPNˆ NLRIs between PEs using MP-BGP 
     are described in [2547bis]. The same techniques including the use of 
     route reflectors and extended community attributes to convey and 
     process route policies can be used in this solution. It is also 
     possible to support inter-AS scenarios where the local and remote PEs 
     reside in different autonomous systems.   
      
     A primary difference with this solution and traditional [2547bis]-style  
     IP VPNs is that a label IS NOT included with the advertised NLRI. This 
     is because labels representing PWs that are used to carry ATM traffic 
     belonging to a switched ATM connection are allocated and distributed 
     via PWE3 signaling protocols at connection setup.                      
      
     The MP-REACH and MP-UNREACH attributes are defined in [MP-BGP]. IANA 
     defined codepoints for VPN-ATM address family identifiers (AFI) and 
     subsequent address family identifiers (SAFI) will be required.  
      
     According to [MP-BGP], the address family of the next hop attribute 
     must match that of the address family contained in the NLRI. This means 
     that the next hop must be specified in the format of an ATM address. 
      
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 17] 
      
                                         

     The BGP next hop used in this solution is the address of the remote PE 
     advertising the ATM NLRIs. This address serves as the destination 
     address for PWE3 signaling messages. Therefore it needs to be a 
     reachable address contained within the PSN that employs either IPv4 or 
     IPv6 addressing. 
      
     There are several ways to achieve this: 
      
         o zero out the RD and embed an IPv4/IPv6 address inside the ATM 
           address as defined in [IP-BASED ATM ADDR]. The IPv4/IPv6 address 
           contained in this address could be a loopback address belonging 
           to the advertising PE. 
            
         o Relax the next hop address family restriction and define a new 
           MP-BGP attribute called ÙBGP-IP-NEXT-HOPˆ that is an IPv4 or IPv6 
           addressed next hop used by any address family. [BGP-4-NEXT-HOP] 
           defines such a technique.   
            
     If the PE implements an ATM address for the next hop it should be 
     observed this address is confined to the PSN. It does not need to be 
     advertised into any of the ATM networks that the PE is attached to. 
      
      
       5.5  PWE3 Signaling  
      
     The PWE3 signaling protocol plays a crucial role in the switched ATM 
     L2VPN solution, as it is the mechanism used to establish the PW segment 
     of the dynamically signaled tuple emulating the switched ATM 
     connection. It is also used to reliably transport ATM signaling 
     parameters between NSPs during connection setup, maintenance and 
     teardown.    
      
     The signaling of a switched ATM connection can be broken down into 
     three parts: a head AC, a PW and a tail AC. The head AC connects the 
     source ATM end-point to the local PE. The tail AC connects the remote 
     PE to the destination ATM end-point. The head and/or tail ACs are 
     signaled using native ATM signaling protocols. The local PE terminates 
     the head AC and the remote PE originates the tail AC.  
      
     The connecting PW binds the head and tail ACs together to form the 
     switched ATM connection. It is dynamically established at head and tail 
     AC creation time and is initiated by the arrival of ATM signaling 
     messages at the local PE. 
      
     The procedures at the local PE to create a PW based on ATM signaling 
     consist of the following: 
      
       o NSP signaling process terminates ATM signaling messages and 
          extracts ATM signaling parameters that need to be conveyed to the 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 18] 
      
                                         

          NSP on the remote PE. To be more precise what is terminated (and 
          then continued at the remote PE) is the transport carriage (SSCOP) 
          for the ATM signaling message contents, and the domain-specific           
          contents of the ATM signaling message such as the PNNI DTL. At the 
          local PE the contents of the signaling message (i.e. information 
          elements) are passed unchanged to a different transport carriage 
          (PWE3 control channel) for transit across the PSN. The reverse 
          happens at the remote PE.        
           
       o NSP signaling process computes an ACI value and tentatively 
          assigns it to the head AC.  This is a globally unique value used 
          to identify the head AC that will be bound to this particular PW 
          at this PE. It must be unique in the context of the local PE, so 
          that the local PE can use it as a handle to determine which PWE3 
          signaling messages from the remote PE correspond to this switched 
          ATM connection.   
           
          The combination of the AC, ACI and PW comprise the forwarder on 
          the PE. However at this point in the connection setup process, the 
          local PE only has the AC and the unique ACI assigned to it. The PW 
          label needed on the local PE to identify the PW forwarder will be 
          delivered when the PWE3 setup message is received from the remote 
          PE. 
           
          The ACI only exists during the lifetime of the switched ATM 
          connection. It should be deleted when either one of the ACs or PW 
          is terminated. 
           
          If the NSP signaling process cannot compute an ACI or there are 
          insufficient resources to allocate AC state on the local PE then 
          an ATM call clearing message is returned upstream towards the ATM 
          source end-point indicating that further connection setup 
          processing through the local PE for this connection is not 
          possible.    
           
       o Install AC state, including the ACI on the local PE.    
           
       o Select the remote PE. This is achieved by performing a lookup in 
          the ATM VRF to determine the next hop IP address of the called 
          party ATM address contained in the ATM signaling message. 
           
          If the lookup fails then the local PE informs the NSP signaling 
          process and an ATM call clearing message is returned upstream 
          towards the ATM source end-point indicating that further 
          connection setup processing through the local PE for this 
          connection is not possible. 
           
       o Decode the next hop address into an IP address 
           
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 19] 
      
                                         

       o Allocate a PW label. If a PW label cannot be allocated then the 
          local PE informs the NSP signaling process and an ATM call 
          clearing message is returned upstream towards the ATM source end-
          point indicating that further connection setup processing through 
          the local PE for this connection is not possible. 
           
       o NSP signaling process encapsulates ATM signaling parameters in an 
          AC signaling TLV and appends it to the PWE3 setup message along 
          with the PW label, PW type, source ACI, target ACI and any other 
          PWE3 signaling objects. The target ACI may be null or it may 
          contain an ACI of a PW forwarder located on the remote PE.   
           
       o Launch the PWE3 setup message towards the remote PE. 
      
     The procedures at the remote PE to create a PW based on ATM signaling 
     originating at the ATM source end-point consist of the following: 
      
       o Receive the PWE3 setup message and parse the contents. 
           
       o Select the PW forwarder. If the received PWE3 setup message 
          contains a non-null target ACI, a comparison is made to existing           
          ACI values assigned to ACs on the remote PE. If a match is made 
          and the associated tail AC exists then select the PW forwarder. 
           
          If no matching existing ACI value is found then the remote PE         
          should send the appropriate PWE3 error message back to the local      
          PE.   
           
       o If the target ACI in the received PWE3 setup message is null and 
          the destination ATM address (extracted from the AC signaling TLV) 
          is reachable according to the NSP routing process then rebuild the 
          ATM signaling message and establish the tail AC. A new ACI value 
          is tentatively assigned to the remote PE AC leading towards the 
          ATM destination pending successful setup of the connection. 
           
          If the destination ATM prefix is not reachable then the remote PE 
          should send the appropriate PWE3 error message back to the local 
          PE. The local PE may choose to de-allocate the PW label and ACI 
          and send an ATM call clearing message upstream towards the ATM 
          source end-point. It may also be possible for the local PE to try 
          another remote PE that has also advertised reachability to the 
          destination ATM prefix. The details of a PWE3 Ùcrankback and 
          rerouteˆ are for further study.    
           
          If the tail AC is successfully established (based on a connection 
          setup message received from the ATM destination end-point) then 
          the ACI is assigned to the AC for the duration of the switched ATM 
          connection.      
           
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 20] 
      
                                         

          If the tail AC cannot be setup, then the remote PE can take one of 
          several possible actions. It may attempt to establish the tail AC 
          through an alternate route or it may send a PWE3 error message 
          back to the local PE. 
           
       o Install AC state, including the ACI on the remote PE.     
           
       o Allocate a PW label and generate a PWE3 setup message towards the 
          local PE that includes the source and target ACI values and ATM 
          signaling parameters.  
           
       o The local PE compares the received target ACI value with the 
          allocated tentative ACI on the local PE. If they match the PW 
          forwarder is selected and the PW from the local PE to the remote 
          PE is built. The ATM signaling message is rebuilt and forwarded to 
          the ATM source end-point. This completes the establishment of the 
          switched ATM connection. 
      
     Connection maintenance and termination are supported in a similar 
     manner by having the NSP signaling process interact with PWE3 and ATM 
     signaling to coordinate and drive the required state changes.  
      
      
       5.6  Attachment Circuit Identifiers (ACI) 
      
     The notion of single-sided provisioning is described in [PPVPN L2 FW]. 
     Through an auto-discovery process [BGP-AUTO], the local PE is able to 
     learn about the remote PEs and its ACIs. It then becomes a 
     straightforward process for the local PE to include the local (source) 
     and remote (target) ACIs in a single PWE3 setup message. The remote PE 
     can use the same ACI values (transposed when flowing from remote back 
     to local) in a PWE3 setup message directed back to the local PE. Thus 
     the local PE is able to initiate creation of a bi-directional PW and 
     have it bound to a pair of ACs, one local and one remote.  
      
     In the switched ATM L2VPN model, the auto-discovery process is 
     performed by MP-BGP propagation of ATM NLRIs. VPN membership is 
     inferred from the configuration of the ATM VRF and the MP-BGP policy 
     rules for installing ATM prefixes in the VRF. The IP addresses of the 
     remote PEs are also present. In a sense each MP-BGP-advertised prefix 
     identifies not a specific AC but rather a pool of potential destination 
     ACs. More specifically the ATM prefix represents an aggregate of 
     discrete end-points at the other end of the tail AC that originates in 
     the advertising (remote) PE.  
      
     The individual head and/or tail ACs are dynamically established at ATM 
     connection setup and so their ACIs cannot be distributed during the 
     auto-discovery process.   
      
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 21] 
      
                                         

     This ACI value is computed on the local PE by the NSP signaling process 
     upon arrival of an ATM signaling message from the ATM source end-point. 
     The ACI must be globally unique so as to remove possible ambiguities 
     that could arise during PW forwarder selection. Its structure, format 
     and how it is derived is a local implementation issue. One possible 
     technique would be to devise an algorithm that computes a unique ACI 
     value based on variables including source and destination ATM 
     addresses, a local PE route ID and an AC interface address. Another 
     option would be use a computed network call correlation identifier 
     [NCCI] value as the ACI. Other techniques are possible. 
      
        
       5.7  AC Signaling TLV  
      
      
     The head and (and possibly the) tail ACs should use the same ATM 
     signaling information to establish their portions of the switched ATM 
     connection. Since the native ATM signaling transport is terminated on 
     the local PE, it is up to the PWE3 signaling protocol to transport the 
     un-modified signaling parameters across the PSN to the remote PE where 
     they can be used to signal the tail AC portion of switched ATM 
     connection. Conceptually one could view this as tunneling the ATM 
     signaling parameters through the PWE3 control channel. 
      
     The contents of an ATM signaling messages pertaining to point-to-point 
     call control are encapsulated in an AC signaling TLV for carriage 
     across the IP/MPLS network in the PWE3 control channel.  
      
     The optional parameters field in LDP mapping and withdraw messages will 
     serve as the AC signaling TLV for conveying ATM signaling messages 
     across an MPLS network. The format and codepoints for the AC Signaling 
     optional parameters are TBD. 
      
     A new AVP in L2TPv3 will serve as the AC signaling TLV for conveying 
     ATM signaling messages across an IP network. The format and codepoints 
     of the AC signaling AVP are TBD. 
      
      
     6. Switched ATM L2VPN Examples 
      
     This section describes examples of switched ATM L2VPN.  
      
       6.1   ATM Signaling using PNNI 
      
     In this first example let∆s assume we have two ATM networks  (call them 
     ATM NETA and ATM NETB) connected via ATM links to PE1 and PE2 
     respectively. PE1 and PE2 are separated by a PSN and connected by one 
     or more PSN tunnels. PE1 and PE2 have established an MP-iBGP session 

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 22] 
      
                                         

     with each other (or through a route reflector). Let∆s also assume that 
     PE1 and PE2 contain an NSP running a PNNI stack.  
      
     PE1 forms a PNNI adjacency with one or more PNNI switches in ATM NETA 
     and begins exchanging PNNI hello messages. Likewise PE2 does the same 
     with one or more PNNI switches in ATM NETB. PE1 and PE2 may advertise 
     themselves as restricted transit if they are not able or configured to 
     support local switching. Note that PE1 and PE2 DO NOT form a PNNI 
     adjacency with each other. 
      
     PE1 and PE2 receive PNNI TSPs from the PNNI switches in ATM NETA and 
     ATM NETB respectively. Each PE maintains a copy of the PNNI topology 
     database for the ATM network that it is directly connected to. 
      
     PE1 extracts the learned ATM prefixes from the PNNI topology database, 
     converts them into VPN-ATM addresses by pre-pending a configured route 
     distinguisher and places them inside the ATM reachability table (ATM 
     VRF). The ATM prefixes are redistributed into MP-BGP and propagated 
     along with a next hop (PE1 address) and other policy attributes to PE2.  
      
     Based on BGP route policies configured on PE2, the MP-BGP advertised 
     VPN-ATM addresses are received on PE2, inserted into the PE2 ATM VRF 
     and redistributed into the PE2 PNNI topology database as exterior 
     addresses. PE2 then floods the exterior ATM addresses in TSPs to 
     neighboring PNNI switches. At this point the PNNI switches in ATM NETB 
     have learned of exterior ATM addresses that are reachable through PE2. 
     The same procedures are performed in the opposite direction so that 
     PNNI switches in ATM NETA can reach one or more exterior ATM addresses 
     through PE1. 
      
     Several observations can be made regarding this technique for ATM 
     prefix distribution: 
      
           o Multiple ATM networks can be tied together without the need for 
             bi-lateral AINI links that can be expensive and can limit 
             dynamic routing. A multi-lateral relationship can be 
             established between multiple providers using one or (preferably 
             more for resilience) more PNNI adjacencies with PEs. 
              
           o MP-BGP route distribution and filtering is used to control the 
             distribution of ATM prefixes between ATM networks. Existing MP-
             BGP procedures and operational practices (employed for other 
             services such as 2547-style VPNs, Multicast etc.) can be 
             leveraged to facilitate inter-domain ATM switching. In addition 
             reachability to ATM prefixes will be dynamically reflected in 
             corresponding MP-BGP advertisements or withdrawls. This level 
             of dynamical routing for connection setups between separate 
             PNNI networks is not possible using static AINI links. 
              
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 23] 
      
                                         

           o Discrete ATM Networks (i.e. ATM NETA, ATM NETB) separated by a 
             PSN cannot be part of the same flat or hierarchical PNNI 
             topology. One or more PEs contained within a particular ATM 
             Network (i.e. ATM NETA) can be part of that network∆s flat or 
             hierarchical topology. This implies that each ATM network 
             scales based on its current topology plus the number of 
             exterior ATM addresses imported from other networks. 
              
           o ATM networks can be connected by parallel PSN and native ATM 
             transports. This topology might be common in a migration 
             scenario. The caveat here is that the ATM networks must be 
             logically partitioned from a PNNI perspective. So the native 
             ATM transport may need to support an AINI link between the two 
             ATM networks. This will permit native ATM signaling messages to 
             flow over the ATM transport but does not permit topology 
             information (i.e. ATM prefixes) to be exchanged that could 
             result in a loop.  
      
     Now let∆s assume that a switched ATM connection between an ATM node 
     (call it CE1) contained in ATM NETA needs to be established with an ATM 
     node (call it CE2) contained in ATM NETB. The destination ATM prefix 
     (CE2) is known and it is reachable through PE1. So CE1 launches an ATM 
     signaling message towards PE1 with a designated transit list (DTL) 
     terminating in PE1. This is because ATM address (CE2) was advertised as 
     exterior and the switches in ATM NETA do not know anything about the 
     PNNI topology in ATM NETB. 
      
     PE1 NSP terminates the signaling message and the procedures outlined in 
     section 5.5 are used to complete the connection setup.  
      
     Several observations can be made regarding this technique for switched 
     ATM connection management: 
      
       o ATM signaling parameters are carried opaquely from the ingress of 
          the PW to the egress PW by the PWE3 signaling channel. This can be 
          viewed loosely as the same thing that happens when ATM signaling 
          traverses two PNNI networks separated by an AINI link. The DTL is 
          terminated at the egress of the first network, signaling 
          parameters are carried across the AINI link un-altered and then 
          the DTL reflecting the second network is computed and inserted.  
           
          It may also be possible to support explicitly routed connections 
          by including the complete lowest level DTLs for the head and tail 
          ACs respectively. To ensure complete end-to-end route diversity, 
          including the IP/MPLS network, an offline provisioning tool will 
          likely be required. 
           
       o PE nodes are the intersection point for between ATM signaling, 
          PWE3 signaling, PSN signaling and PSN routing. It is the only 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 24] 
      
                                         

          logical point in the network to consider additional interactions 
          between these mechanisms that may be useful in delivering the 
          desired service using optimal resources. Such interactions are 
          left for further study. 
           
              
       6.2  ATM Signaling using AINI 
      
     AINI enables the switched connection management between two ATM 
     networks. Native ATM signaling messages for connection management are 
     propagated across AINI links but topology information (i.e. PNNI) is 
     not. Reachability to ATM prefixes through AINI links requires the use 
     of static routes.  
      
     Let∆s assume a similar configuration as described in the previous 
     section with the exception that the NSPs on PE1 and PE2 are not running 
     PNNI. The PE NSPs in this case are running an AINI signaling stack 
     (basically the same as PNNI signaling). Each PE forms an AINI signaling 
     adjacency with directly-attached ATM switches. The ATM switches in each 
     network (ATM NETA and ATM NETB) may be running PNNI or some other ATM 
     signaling and routing protocol amongst themselves. 
      
     There is no way for the PE to dynamically learn about ATM prefixes for 
     the ATM networks it is directly connected. This is because topology 
     information does not flow over AINI links. The operator must manually 
     configure ATM prefixes representing the directly attached ATM networks 
     on each PE. MP-BGP will then propagate this information to the remote 
     PEs.  
      
     In addition the operator will have to manually configure all exterior 
     ATM prefixes on the ATM switch (or switches) connected to the PE by 
     AINI links. This will serve to inject the exterior ATM prefixes into 
     each ATM network.  
      
     The signaling procedures are performed in a similar manner as described 
     in section 5.5. 
      
     Several observations can be made regarding this approach: 
      
     o Lack of topology exchange between the CE and PE increases the 
       configuration burden on the operator. This burden can be reduced if 
       the ATM prefixes for a particular network can be summarized. 
        
     o This might be the preferred method for those ATM networks that 
       already employ AINI links to interconnect with external ATM networks 
       or for those operators running a proprietary ATM routing and 
       signaling protocol. 
      
       6.3  ATM Signaling on One AC 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 25] 
      
                                         

      
     The examples described in the previous two sections assume that ATM 
     signaling is used to setup and manage the head and tail ACs. A 
     transition scenario for providers migrating to a PSN may emerge where 
     some CE devices (i.e. routers) are directly connected to a PE while 
     others are connected to a switched ATM infrastructure.  
      
     Let∆s assume that CE1a is a router connected to CE1 that is in turn an 
     ATM node inside ATM NETA as described above. Let∆s further assume that 
     CE3 is directly attached to PE2 via some sort of statically configured 
     ATM data-link. The provider then would like to establish a switched 
     connection (i.e. SPVC) between CE1 and PE2. 
      
     This can be accomplished using the techniques outlined in this 
     document. However there are several considerations that must be noted. 
     First the switches in ATM NETA must have some notion of the AC on PE2 
     as a reachable ATM prefix. This is because ATM signaling is forwarded 
     based on a destination ATM address. One way to accomplish this is to 
     configure the provisioned ACs on the PE (PE2 in this example) with a 
     unique ATM address culled from a single ATM prefix. Then the procedures 
     for propagating ATM prefixes between PEs (from PE2 to PE1) and into the 
     remote ATM network (ATM NETA) can be used. Other techniques for 
     presenting ATM reachability to static ACs are possible. 
      
     Second the ACI identifying the static AC must be present on PE2. Recall 
     from section 5.6 that only the source ACI is computed on the local PE 
     during connection setup. But the PE2-CE3 AC has been pre-configured 
     with an ACI and the PWE3 setup message arriving at PE2 must contain the 
     exact same value in the target ACI field. The question becomes how does 
     PE1 plug in the appropriate target ACI value in the PWE3 setup message 
     that will match the pre-configured ACI value on PE2? 
      
     One possibility would be to take explicitly configured ACI values on 
     PE2 and inject them into the ATM VRF for MP-BGP distribution to other 
     PEs in the network including PE1. When the ATM signaling message 
     arrives at PE1 a longest prefix match lookup based on the called party 
     address is performed in the ATM VRF. If a "host route" (length of 19 
     bytes or 152 bits) is found, then copy that value to the target ACI.  
      
     Another possibility would be to filter ATM signaling messages and 
     employ a specific target ACI values based on a match criteria. For 
     example any ATM signaling message destined for prefix X would use a 
     target ACI of Y.    
      
     Another consideration is the notion of L2VPN interworking or more 
     specifically, PW interworking between ACs of different types sharing a 
     single PW as outlined in [L2VPN IW]. There are a couple of scenarios 
     that one can foresee employing the functions outlined in that document. 
     First switched ATM connections may need to be interworked to frame 
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 26] 
      
                                         

     relay via FRF.8 procedures [FRF.8]. This could be achieved by having 
     the remote PE NSP or an external box support an FRF.8 function.  
      
     The second scenario would involve the interworking of heterogeneous ACs 
     where one AC is established using ATM signaling procedures and the 
     other is a static AC implemented over a non-ATM L2 media such a 
     ethernet. The issue involves how to determine if the local AC (from CE1 
     to PE1) should be terminated on the local PE and then what PW type and 
     encapsulation should be used when establishing the PW with the remote 
     PE. 
      
     In the examples covered in the previous sections, ATM cells are 
     ingressing and egressing the PW. The same PW type identifying ATM 
     connections ((i.e. VC or VP) is used during the PWE3 signaling process. 
     With L2VPN interworking, there are several options based on whether the 
     local AC is terminated on the local PE or extended all the way through 
     to the remote PE. 
      
     One possible technique is to base this determination on a policy 
     associated with switched connections destined for a particular ATM 
     prefix or host route. If PE2 contains multiple Ethernet ACs that the 
     provider feels are candidates to sink connection setup requests 
     triggered by ATM signaling, then a prefix identifying those ACs could 
     be advertised to PE1. The local policy on PE1 would be to locally 
     terminate all connections bound for that prefix and signal with a 
     particular pre-configured PW type. The details of how this is 
     accomplished are a local implementation matter. 
      
       
     7. QoS 
        
     QoS is an inherent feature of ATM networks. This section discusses 
     aspects of QoS as they relate to the switched ATM L2VPN model. 
      
       7.1  QoS Routing 
           
     PNNI computes paths to a destination by taking into consideration node, 
     link and path constraints. This information is reliably flooded to all 
     nodes (switches) in a defined area called a peer group, collected and 
     stored in a local topology database on each node, and is then consulted 
     by the source PNNI node during the path calculation process. The 
     precision of this process correlates with the level of detail contained 
     in the topology database. The specifics of ATM topologies external to 
     the peer group are not contained in the local topology database. 
     Therefore the source PNNI node cannot compute a detailed constraint-
     based path for a topology other than what is contained in its local 
     topology database.  
      

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 27] 
      
                                         

     The solution is to compute a loose source route between the source and 
     destination. The specific details of each separate peer group are 
     computed and filled in by the source (ingress) PNNI switch (of that 
     peer group)_as the connection request follows the loose source route to 
     the destination. 
      
     Remote ATM networks that are reachable through a PSN in the switched 
     ATM L2VPN model are considered external networks. A PNNI node in a 
     local ATM network can only compute a constraint-based path up to the 
     exit point of the PNNI domain, which in this case is the local PE. 
     After the remote PE receives the ATM signaling parameters via PWE3 
     signaling, it can compute a constraint-based path through the remote 
     ATM network. 
      
     By default the details of the transit IP/MPLS network are not available 
     to the switches in the local ATM network. Injecting IP/MPLS QoS 
     constraints into the local ATM network would require as-yet-to-be-
     invented translations between ATM and IP QoS metrics. The PSN nodes 
     would now need to track, flood, translate and then export specific 
     details regarding network capacity and performance to the local ATM 
     network. QoS information about the remote ATM network would need to 
     flow into the PSN system so that the optimal remote PE could be 
     selected during the path calculation process. Overall this could add 
     significant cost and complexity to the solution.  
      
     An alternative approach and the one that aligns with the philosophy of 
     the switched ATM L2VPN model is to leverage existing PSN mechanisms to 
     support the SLAs of the tunneled ATM connections. There are several 
     possibilities to achieve this: 
      
     o Provision a priori sufficient resources and capacity in the PSN 
       backbone to more than meet the aggregate of the signaled ATM traffic 
       load.  
        
     o Use the ATM QoS signaling information at the ingress and egress PE 
       nodes to dynamically map the PW to a specific per-class path through 
       the PSN. For example a CBR ATM VC would be vectored onto a PSN tunnel 
       engineered with guaranteed bandwidth and low jitter. UBR traffic 
       would be directed over a best-effort PSN tunnel. Per-class paths can 
       be established using several techniques those outlined in [DIFFSERV 
       TE]. 
        
      
       7.2  Admission Control 
      
     Call admission control (CAC) is important function performed by ATM 
     switches to ensure that the signaled connection receives the necessary 
     resources on each switch to support the desired level of service. The 

      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 28] 
      
                                         

     PE may perform a CAC and resource allocation function by interpreting 
     the traffic descriptors contained in the ATM signaling message.  
      
     The CAC process on the local PE may take on several different forms: 
      
       o Check on the ATM AC resources in the upstream direction towards 
          the ATM signaling source. 
           
       o Check on the ATM AC resources in the upstream direction and in the 
          downstream direction towards the PSN next hop. 
           
       o Check on the ATM AC resources in the upstream direction, the PSN 
          next hop and if MPLS TE [RFC2702] is present, the QoS parameters 
          associated with an existing tunnel to the remote PE. 
           
          If multiple per-class TE tunnels exist towards the same remote PE 
          then an option might be for the PE to impose a PW forwarder that 
          steers traffic onto an appropriate per-class tunnel. This would be 
          performed after the local PE receives the PW label from the remote 
          PE. 
      
     The local CAC process at the remote PE may take on several forms: 
      
       o check on the ATM AC resources in the downstream direction towards 
          the ATM signaling destination. 
           
       o check on the ATM AC resources in the downstream direction and in 
          the upstream direction towards the PSN previous hop.  
      
     These solutions all rely on some pre-provisioning of PSN tunnel 
     resources. There may be a desire to take a more dynamic approach that 
     matches the provisioning of the PSN tunnel resources with that of the 
     tunneled ATM connection in real-time. 
      
     One approach would be to trigger a TE tunnel setup upon arrival of ATM 
     signaling and generation of PW signaling messages. While theoretically 
     possible, this is not an advisable practice to undertake at this time. 
     This is because there is a signaling frequency mismatch between ATM and 
     IP/MPLS networks. ATM nodes are designed and optimized to support the 
     hop-by-hop signaling of hundreds and even thousands of individual end-
     to-end ATM connections per second, each with their own unique QoS 
     attributes. IP/MPLS nodes are designed to signal dozens of edge-to-edge 
     TE tunnels per second, each capable of accommodating an aggregate 
     number flows including PWs.    
      
     A more scalable solution would be to aggregate ATM and PW signaling at 
     the PE to dynamically adjust the resources allocated to a TE tunnel. A 
     similar notion is described in [RFC3175]. 
      
      
      
     Metz, et al.                                             [Page 29] 
      
                                         

      
       7.3  Data Plane 
      
     The local and remote PE should be capable of interpreting ATM traffic 
     descriptors (and other QoS-related signaling elements) and allocating 
     the appropriate resources along the data plane. Examples of such 
     actions on the ingress PE might include: 
      
     o Dynamically configure the values of the per-AC policer including mean 
       and peak reates, burst sizes and jitter (cell-delay variation 
       tolerance). 
        
     o Map the ATM traffic class to an appropriate Diffserv per-hop 
       behavior. This would be accomplished by marking the diffserv 
       codepoints (DSCP) or experiment bits (EXP) of the PW and PSN headers 
       based on the signaled traffic of the ATM connection. There is no 
       formal standard to accomplish this because it is up to the provider 
       to determine how best to support the requested service.  
        
     The egress PE may choose to perform some form of traffic shaping to 
     smooth out any accumulated jitter built up as the encapsulated cells 
     traversed the PSN. 
      
      
     8. Security Considerations 
        
     This document discusses aspects of interworking between ATM and IP/MPLS 
     control planes.  There are security issues and procedures for each 
     control plane which are documented with their individual 
     specifications.  The interface between the two involves a high level of 
     trust. This interface takes place within a single interworking network 
     element (the PE) under control of the provider of the IP/MPLS network. 
     The PE needs to be secured, and if the PE functions are distributed the 
     interfaces between the distributed functions must be secured as well.  
     The PE must participate in security protocols of both the ATM and 
     IP/MPLS networks, and in addition each network should take into 
     consideration the information it is willing to receive and believe.
