K_MAT = the authentication keying material associated with the SA
HMAC  = the keyed hashing algorithm used in the SA
ADDR  = the IPv6 address whose reachability is being checked
TIME  = the current time or a nonce in a host specific format
        
Challenge = HMAC(K_MAT, ADDR | TIME)

Reply = HMAC(K_MAT, Challenge | ADDR)
