     2.  Abstract

     This document describes how Mobile IP may be supported in roaming, via
     definition of  a  RADIUS  attribute  for  Mobile-IP  v4  Configuration
     Option, as described in RFC 2290.


     3.  Introduction

     As  described  in  [6],  support  for Mobile IP is a requirement for a
     roaming standard.

     RFC 2290 [8] describes the Mobile-IPv4 Configuration  Option  for  PPP
     IPCP.  This  option  allows two PPP peers to communicate their support
     for Mobile IP, as well as for the NAS to pass the home address to  the
     dial-in user.

     In  order  to permit Mobile IP configuration in roaming services, this
     document  defines  modifications  to  the   RADIUS   Framed-IP-Address
     Attribute,   as   well   as  defining  a  new  Mobile-IP-Configuration
     attribute.

     4.  Attribute definitions


     4.1.  Framed-IP-Address

     Description

        This Attribute indicates the address to be configured for the user.
        It  MAY  be  used  in  Access-Accept packets.  It MAY be used in an
        Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the  server  that  it
        would  prefer that address, but the server is not required to honor
        the hint.

     A summary of the Framed-IP-Address Attribute format  is  shown  below.
     The fields are transmitted from left to right.

     0                   1                   2                   3

     |        Address (cont)         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Type

        8 for Framed-IP-Address

     Length

        6

     Address

        The  Address  field is four octets.  The value 0xFFFFFFFF indicates
        that the NAS should allow the  user  to  select  an  address  (e.g.
        Negotiated).   The  value  0xFFFFFFFE indicates that the NAS should
        select an address for the  user  (e.g.  Assigned  from  a  pool  of
        addresses  kept  by  the NAS).  The value 0xFFFFFFFD indicates that
        Mobile IP will be configured for the user, and therefore  that  the
        NAS  should  not select an address for the user, Other valid values
        indicate that the NAS should  use  that  value  as  the  user's  IP
        address.


     4.2.  Mobile-IP-Configuration

     Description

        This  Attribute  indicates the Mobile-IP Home Address to be config-
        ured for the user. It MAY be used in Access-Accept packets.

     A summary of the Mobile-IP-Configuration  Attribute  format  is  shown
     below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

     Length

     Address

        The  Address  field  is  four octets, and encodes the Mobile Node's
        Home Address. This field MUST NOT be zero.
