   The 'image' Media Type for the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
                  draft-salgueiro-image-media-type-00

Abstract

   This document describes the registration of 'image' as a top-level
   media type for the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  This media
   type is primarily used by SDP to negotiate and establish T.38 media
   streams.

Internet-Draft       'image' Media Type Registration          April 2011


1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   In the previous version of the SDP specification [RFC2327] packetized
   media types, such as those shared by RTP, share the same namespace
   used by the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) media types
   registry [RFC2048] (i.e.  "MIME types").  This is in contrast to the
   latest version of the SDP specification [RFC4566] where an SDP-
   specific media type registry is created.  The top-level SDP media
   content types registered by [RFC4566] are "audio", "video", "text",
   "application", and "message".  A glaring omission on this list is the
   'image' media type.

   The 'image' media type is an existing top-level MIME type and is
   widely used by SDP for setting up T.38 Real-Time Facsimile [T38]
   media streams.  This media type is extensively referenced by examples
   in ITU-T T.38 [T38] and IETF standards like [RFC4145].

   This document complies with the request of section 8.2.1 of [RFC4566]
   that indicates:

      "The same rules should apply for media names as for top-level
      media content types, and where possible the same name should be
      registered for SDP as for MIME.  For media other than existing
      top-level media content types, a Standards Track RFC MUST be
      produced for a new top-level content type to be registered, and
      the registration MUST provide good justification why no existing
      media name is appropriate."

   The registration of 'image' as a top-level SDP media type ensures
   seamless continuity with documentation that uses the 'image' MIME
   type.  This also simplifies the usage of previously registered MIME
   sub-types like 'image/t38' [RFC3362] that are used as SDP media
   descriptors for T.38 [T38].


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers with IANA the 'image' media type as a top-
   level media content type in accordance with the "Standards Action"
   policy defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].  This registration
   follows the procedures described in BCP 13 [RFC4288].

      To:  ietf-types@iana.org

      Subject:  Registration of 'image' media type for the Session
         Description Protocol (SDP)

      Type name:  image

      Subtype name:

      Required parameters:  None

      Optional parameters:  None

      Encoding considerations:
         Binary encoding as defined in ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [T38].

      Security considerations:
         Refer to Section 4

      Interoperability considerations:
         This media type is primarily intended to be utilized as a
         parameter by SDP [RFC4566] in SIP [RFC3261] to establish T.38
         [T38] media streams.

      Published specification:  RFC 4566

      Applications that use this media type:
         Real-time facsimile (fax)

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):
         File extension(s):
         Macintosh file type code(s):

4.  Security Considerations

   The 'image' media type registered by this document to the IANA
   registry for SDP [SDP-IANA] is primarily for use by the offer/answer
   model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC4566] for the
   negotiation and establishment of T.38 [T38] media streams using the
   Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261].  This additional SDP parameter
   does not introduce any new security considerations beyond those
   detailed in Section 7 of [RFC4566].  The security vulnerabilities in
   T.38 [T38] and its associated transport protocols (TCP [RFC0793], UDP
   [RFC0768], or RTP [RFC3550]) are well documented in each of their
   respective specifications.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks goes to the chairs of the IETF Multiparty Multimedia Session
   Control (MMUSIC) working group (Miguel A. Garcia and Flemming
   Andreasen) for their guidance, encouragement, and the creation of the
   media type registry.

   The author would also like to acknowledge the considerable efforts of
   Kevin Fleming and the members of the FoIP TG in the SIP Forum that
   contributed to the new revision of the ITU-T T.38 Recommendation that
   prompted the need to register the 'image' media type for SDP.
