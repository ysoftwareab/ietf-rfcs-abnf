   Internet-Draft          Load Sharing in PMIPv6                September 2008

    
  1. Introduction  

       Recently, the ETF NETLMM workgroup proposes the Proxy Mobile IPv6
       (PMIPv6) [2] protocol which provides the mobility support for mobile
       nodes without involvement of mobility signaling. In order to 
       facilitate the network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines 
       a Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile 
       IPv6 [2] signaling, and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which acts 
       similar to a Home Agent, anchoring a Mobile Node's sessions within 
       a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain. The LMA and the MAG establish 
       a bidirectional tunnel for forwarding all data traffic belonging to 
       the Mobile Nodes.

       In PMIPv6, the LMA is in charge of all the traffic belonging to its 
       PMIPv6 domain. It is clear that the LMA will have high load, and could
       collapse due to overhead. As wathing movie and video chatting become a
       popular trend nowdays, it is obviously important to consider the overload
       problem of the LMA. In this memo, we propose a load sharing mechanism, 
       which introduces multiple LMAs in a PMIPv6 domain, and defines the Route
       Management Server (RMS) to keep the consistency of route between different
       LMAs. Through the interaction among LMA, MAG and RMS, our mechansim could
       achive the dynamic, bi-direction load sharing.
       

  2. Conventions & Terminilogy

      2.1. Conventions used in this document 

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
       NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
       this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].  

    2.2. Terminology 

       All the general mobility related terms used in this document are to 
       be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base specification [5]. 

       This document adopts the terms, Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and 
       Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) from the NETLMM Goals document [6]. This 
       document mainly uses the following terms in this document. 

       Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain) 

       Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain refers to the network where the mobility 
       management of a mobile node is handled using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 
       protocol as defined in this specification.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 
       domain includes local mobility anchors and mobile access gateways 
       between which security associations can be setup and authorization 
       for sending Proxy Binding Updates on behalf of the mobile nodes can 
       be ensured. 

       Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) 
       
       Local Mobility Anchor is the home agent for the mobile node in the 
       Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. It is the topological anchor point for the 
       mobile node's home network prefix and is the entity that manages the 
       mobile node's binding state. The local mobility anchor has the 
       functional capabilities of a home agent as defined in Mobile IPv6 
       base specification [5] with the additional capabilities required for 
       supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol as defined in this 
       specification.

    Internet-Draft         Load Sharing in PMIPv6            September 2008 
        
       
       Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) 
       
       Mobile Access Gateway is a function that manages the mobility related 
       signaling for a mobile node that is attached to its access link. It 
       is responsible for tracking the mobile node's movements to and from 
       the access link and for signaling the mobile node's local mobility 
       anchor. 

       Mobile Node (MN) 
       
       Throughout this document, the term mobile node is used to refer to an 
       IP host or router whose mobility is managed by the network. The 
       mobile node may be operating in IPv6 mode, IPv4 mode or inIPv4/IPv6 
       dual mode.  The mobile node is not required to participate in any IP 
       mobility related signaling for achieving mobility for an IP address 
       that is obtained in that Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  

       Route Management Server (RMS) 
       
       RMS is a new element that we introduced in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
       All LMAs report its load state to RMS periodically, RMS check load 
       state of all LMAs, and pick the lightest-load LMA to take on part 
       traffic of overloaded LMA. In this way, RMS could help to achieve the
       upforading load sharing. on other hand, when MN performs an handoff, the
       new MAG send Route_ajust to RMS, the RMS forwards Route_ajust to all 
       LMAs, LMA adjust their routes accordingly.
        
  3. Load Sharing Mechanism
       
      We introduce new network entity RMS in a PMIPv6 domain. It is requested 
      that RMS MUST has connexity with MAG and LMA. The load Sharing Mechanism
      include three key procedures, which are described in section 3.1, 3.2, 
      and 3.3 respectively.  
     
     3.1  set up multiple tunnels     
    
        To achieve load sharing in proxy mobile ipv6,multiple tunnels
        between LMAs and MAGs need to be estiblished, which can be seen in
        Figure 1. Concrete steps are as follows:
    
        a).When a MAG start, read its profile for LMAs' information (which
           is entered by the PMIPv6 administrator).Then the MAG sents the
           tunnel-establishment request Tnl_request to LMAs.
    
         b).After receiving a Tnl_request from a MAG, a LMA will establish a
            tunnel and return the tunnel-establishment acknowledge Tnl_ack.
    
         c).Receiving a response Tnl_ack from a LMA,the MAG establishs a
            ipv6-in-ipv6 tunnel between them.

        Comparing with the standard PMIPv6 protocol, the additional
        advantage of the establishment of such tunnels in advance is that it
        is able to benefit MN's handoff among MAGs: When a MN from one MAG
        to handoff to another MAG, the LMA just need to change the route
        without having to re-establish tunnel.Thes method save the
        processing time in MN's handoff,and so lower the packet-loss rate
        and delay.

  3.2. up forwarding load sharing    
    
    The steps of dynamic load sharing on the up forwarding data can be
    seen in Figure 2.We explain them as follows:
    
    a).Each LMA calculate  each MAG's packets forwarding number,the total
    number of up forwarding packets and the CPU utilization rate at
    another cetain time(we sugest that for 5 minites).And then the LMA
    sends these results information in Load_info signal to the routing
    management server RMS.
    
    b).Routing management server RMS will write the load information of
    each LMA into the load list maintained by itself. The load list is
    showed in Figure 3.
    
    c).Routing management server RMS traversal of the load list for a
    certain period.and then deal with the load sharing with the
    following rules:A LMA (assumed to be LMA1)' is overload means that
    its CPU utilization rate are equal or greater than 80%,and
    forwarding packets number is greater than 60,000;A LMA (assumed to
    be LMA2) is light load means that its CPU utilization rate are less
    than 80%.Then,routing management entities RMS send load adjustment
    signal Load_adjust to MAG1 who has the most data forwarding to the
    LMA.

    d).Received the load adjustment signal, MAG1 will change its routing
    based on the signal's content, making the data transmitted to LMA2
    which at first is transmitted to LMA1.Then the LMA1's load is
    reduced.
    
    It can be seen that in the above process, each LMA examine its load
    information and send it to RMS. RMS will adjust the MAG's data forwarding 
    path in real-time based on the LMAs load information.These mechanism 
    achieve dynamic load sharing.

 3.3. down forwarding load sharing  
	
     The steps of dynamic load sharing on the down forwarding data can be
     seen in Figure 3.We explain them as follows:
        a) When MN performs an handoff (assumed from MAG1 to MAG2), after 
           the normal PBU / PBA exchange, MAG2 send Route_ajust to route 
          management server.
	b) Received the Route_ajust signal,Routing update entities forward 
           Route_ajust to all LMA, LMA adjust their routes accordingly,so 	           
           that the data to the MN can forward to MAG2 through the tunnel,
          so as to make it forward correctly.
     It can be seen that several LMAs,compared to the single LMA,achieve 
     consistency in the routing of the MN through the RMS.All LMAs can 
     forward downlink data received by MN to the MAG MN attach to correctly 
     and achieve downlink data load balancing.

      Length
  
          8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length of the option in
          octets, excluding the type and length fields.  This field MUST 
          be set to 32.
			
     MN prefix
	
         A sixteen-byte field containing the MN prefix

    old MAG address
	 
         A sixteen-byte field containing the old MAG address

   new MAG address
				   
     A sixteen-byte field containing the new MAG address	    

4.  Security Considerations 
   
   The messages use in this memo are just used for checking reachability
   between the MAG and the LMA, and for achieving load sharing between 
   multiple LMAs.  They do not carry information that is useful for 
   eavesdroppers on the path.  Therefore, confidentiality protection is 
   not required. Integrity protection using IPsec [3] for the messages MUST 
   be supported on the MAG,LMA and RMS.

   If dynamic key negotiation between the MAG and RMS, between RMS the LMA is 
   required, IKEv2 [4] should be used.

5.  IANA Considerations  
    
   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this memo currently.
