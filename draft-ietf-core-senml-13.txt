            Media Types for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)
                        draft-ietf-core-senml-13

Abstract

   This specification defines media types for representing simple sensor
   measurements and device parameters in the Sensor Measurement Lists
   (SenML).  Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), eXtensible
   Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which
   share the common SenML data model.  A simple sensor, such as a
   temperature sensor, could use one of these media types in protocols
   such as HTTP or CoAP to transport the measurements of the sensor or
   to be configured.

1.  Overview

   Connecting sensors to the Internet is not new, and there have been
   many protocols designed to facilitate it.  This specification defines
   new media types for carrying simple sensor information in a protocol
   such as HTTP [RFC7230] or CoAP [RFC7252].  This format was designed
   so that processors with very limited capabilities could easily encode
   a sensor measurement into the media type, while at the same time a
   server parsing the data could relatively efficiently collect a large
   number of sensor measurements.  SenML can be used for a variety of
   data flow models, most notably data feeds pushed from a sensor to a
   collector, and the web resource model where the sensor is requested
   as a resource representation (e.g., "GET /sensor/temperature").

   There are many types of more complex measurements and measurements
   that this media type would not be suitable for.  SenML strikes a
   balance between having some information about the sensor carried with
   the sensor data so that the data is self describing but it also tries
   to make that a fairly minimal set of auxiliary information for
   efficiency reason.  Other information about the sensor can be
   discovered by other methods such as using the CoRE Link Format
   [RFC6690].

   SenML is defined by a data model for measurements and simple meta-
   data about measurements and devices.  The data is structured as a
   single array that contains a series of SenML Records which can each
   contain fields such as an unique identifier for the sensor, the time
   the measurement was made, the unit the measurement is in, and the
   current value of the sensor.  Serializations for this data model are
   defined for JSON [RFC8259], CBOR [RFC7049], XML

   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126], and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI)
   [W3C.REC-exi-20140211].

   For example, the following shows a measurement from a temperature
   gauge encoded in the JSON syntax.

   [
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","v":23.1}
   ]

   In the example above, the array has a single SenML Record with a
   measurement for a sensor named "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" with a
   current value of 23.1 degrees Celsius.

2.  Requirements and Design Goals

   The design goal is to be able to send simple sensor measurements in
   small packets from large numbers of constrained devices.  Keeping the
   total size of payload small makes it easy to use SenML also in
   constrained networks, e.g., in a 6LoWPAN [RFC4944].  It is always
   difficult to define what small code is, but there is a desire to be
   able to implement this in roughly 1 KB of flash on a 8 bit
   microprocessor.  Experience with power meters and other large scale
   deployments has indicated that the solution needs to support allowing
   multiple measurements to be batched into a single HTTP or CoAP
   request.  This "batch" upload capability allows the server side to
   efficiently support a large number of devices.  It also conveniently
   supports batch transfers from proxies and storage devices, even in
   situations where the sensor itself sends just a single data item at a
   time.  The multiple measurements could be from multiple related
   sensors or from the same sensor but at different times.

   The basic design is an array with a series of measurements.  The
   following example shows two measurements made at different times.
   The value of a measurement is given by the "v" field, the time of a
   measurement is in the "t" field, the "n" field has a unique sensor
   name, and the unit of the measurement is carried in the "u" field.

   [
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","t":1.276020076e+09,
      "v":23.5},
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","t":1.276020091e+09,
      "v":23.6}
   ]

   To keep the messages small, it does not make sense to repeat the "n"
   field in each SenML Record so there is a concept of a Base Name which
   is simply a string that is prepended to the Name field of all



Jennings, et al.        Expires September 3, 2018               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    SenML                       March 2018


   elements in that record and any records that follow it.  So a more
   compact form of the example above is the following.

   [
     {"bn":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","t":1.276020076e+09,
      "v":23.5},
     {"u":"Cel","t":1.276020091e+09,
      "v":23.6}
   ]

   In the above example the Base Name is in the "bn" field and the "n"
   fields in each Record are the empty string so they are omitted.

   Some devices have accurate time while others do not so SenML supports
   absolute and relative times.  Time is represented in floating point
   as seconds.  Values greater than zero represent an absolute time
   relative to the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00Z in UTC time) and the
   time is counted same way as the Portable Operating System Interface
   (POSIX) "seconds since the epoch" [TIME_T].  Values of 0 or less
   represent a relative time in the past from the current time.  A
   simple sensor with no absolute wall clock time might take a
   measurement every second, batch up 60 of them, and then send the
   batch to a server.  It would include the relative time each
   measurement was made compared to the time the batch was sent in each
   SenML Record.  The server might have accurate NTP time and use the
   time it received the data, and the relative offset, to replace the
   times in the SenML with absolute times before saving the SenML Pack
   in a document database.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document also uses the following terms:

   SenML Record:  One measurement or configuration instance in time
      presented using the SenML data model.

   SenML Pack:  One or more SenML Records in an array structure.

   SenML Label:  A short name used in SenML Records to denote different
      SenML fields (e.g., "v" for "value").

Internet-Draft                    SenML                       March 2018


   SenML Field:  A component of a record that associates a value to a
      SenML Label for this record.

   This document uses the terms "attribute" and "tag" where they occur
   with the underlying technologies (XML, CBOR [RFC7049], and Link
   Format [RFC6690]), not for SenML concepts per se.  Note that
   "attribute" has been widely used previously as a synonym for SenML
   "field", though.

4.  SenML Structure and Semantics

   Each SenML Pack carries a single array that represents a set of
   measurements and/or parameters.  This array contains a series of
   SenML Records with several fields described below.  There are two
   kinds of fields: base and regular.  The base fields can be included
   in any SenML Record and they apply to the entries in the Record.
   Each base field also applies to all Records after it up to, but not
   including, the next Record that has that same base field.  All base
   fields are optional.  Regular fields can be included in any SenML
   Record and apply only to that Record.

4.1.  Base Fields

   Base Name:  This is a string that is prepended to the names found in
      the entries.

   Base Time:  A base time that is added to the time found in an entry.

   Base Unit:  A base unit that is assumed for all entries, unless
      otherwise indicated.  If a record does not contain a Unit value,
      then the Base Unit is used.  Otherwise the value found in the Unit
      (if any) is used.

   Base Value:  A base value is added to the value found in an entry,
      similar to Base Time.

   Base Sum:  A base sum is added to the sum found in an entry, similar
      to Base Time.

   Version:  Version number of media type format.  This field is an
      optional positive integer and defaults to 5 if not present.  [RFC
      Editor: change the default value to 10 when this specification is
      published as an RFC and remove this note]

Internet-Draft                    SenML                       March 2018


4.2.  Regular Fields

   Name:  Name of the sensor or parameter.  When appended to the Base
      Name field, this must result in a globally unique identifier for
      the resource.  The name is optional, if the Base Name is present.
      If the name is missing, Base Name must uniquely identify the
      resource.  This can be used to represent a large array of
      measurements from the same sensor without having to repeat its
      identifier on every measurement.

   Unit:  Unit for a measurement value.  Optional.

   Value:  Value of the entry.  Optional if a Sum value is present,
      otherwise required.  Values are represented using basic data
      types.  This specification defines floating point numbers ("v"
      field for "Value"), booleans ("vb" for "Boolean Value"), strings
      ("vs" for "String Value") and binary data ("vd" for "Data Value").
      Exactly one value field MUST appear unless there is Sum field in
      which case it is allowed to have no Value field.

   Sum:  Integrated sum of the values over time.  Optional.  This field
      is in the unit specified in the Unit value multiplied by seconds.

   Time:  Time when value was recorded.  Optional.

   Update Time:  Period of time in seconds that represents the maximum
      time before this sensor will provide an updated reading for a
      measurement.  Optional.  This can be used to detect the failure of
      sensors or communications path from the sensor.

   document with their respective labels and data types.

   Data Value is base64 encoded string with URL safe alphabet as defined
   in Section 5 of [RFC4648], with padding omitted.

   For details of the JSON representation see Section 5, for the CBOR
   Section 6, and for the XML Section 7.

4.4.  Considerations

   The SenML format can be extended with further custom fields.  Both
   new base and regular fields are allowed.  See Section 12.2 for
   details.  Implementations MUST ignore fields they don't recognize
   unless that field has a label name that ends with the '_' character
   in which case an error MUST be generated.

   All SenML Records in a Pack MUST have the same version number.  This
   is typically done by adding a Base Version field to only the first
   Record in the Pack.

   Systems reading one of the objects MUST check for the Version field.
   If this value is a version number larger than the version which the
   system understands, the system SHOULD NOT use this object.  This
   allows the version number to indicate that the object contains
   structure or semantics that is different from what is defined in the
   present document beyond just making use of the extension points
   provided here.  New version numbers can only be defined in an RFC
   that updates this specification or it successors.

   The Name value is concatenated to the Base Name value to yield the
   name of the sensor.  The resulting concatenated name needs to
   uniquely identify and differentiate the sensor from all others.  The
   concatenated name MUST consist only of characters out of the set "A"
   to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", "-", ":", ".", "/", and "_";
   furthermore, it MUST start with a character out of the set "A" to
   "Z", "a" to "z", or "0" to "9".  This restricted character set was
   chosen so that concatenated names can be used directly within various
   URI schemes (including segments of an HTTP path with no special
   encoding) and can be used directly in many databases and analytic
   systems.  [RFC5952] contains advice on encoding an IPv6 address in a
   name.  See Section 14 for privacy considerations that apply to the
   use of long-term stable unique identifiers.

   Although it is RECOMMENDED that concatenated names are represented as
   URIs [RFC3986] or URNs [RFC8141], the restricted character set
   specified above puts strict limits on the URI schemes and URN
   namespaces that can be used.  As a result, implementers need to take
   care in choosing the naming scheme for concatenated names, because
   such names both need to be unique and need to conform to the
   restricted character set.  One approach is to include a bit string
   that has guaranteed uniqueness (such as a 1-wire address).  Some of
   the examples within this document use the device URN namespace as
   specified in [I-D.arkko-core-dev-urn].  UUIDs [RFC4122] are another
   way to generate a unique name.  However, the restricted character set
   does not allow the use of many URI schemes, such as the 'tag' scheme
   [RFC4151] and the 'ni' scheme [RFC6920], in names as such.  The use
   of URIs with characters incompatible with this set, and possible
   mapping rules between the two, are outside of the scope of the
   present document.

   If the Record has no Unit, the Base Unit is used as the Unit.  Having
   no Unit and no Base Unit is allowed.

   If either the Base Time or Time value is missing, the missing field
   is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Time and Time values
   are added together to get the time of measurement.  A time of zero
   indicates that the sensor does not know the absolute time and the
   measurement was made roughly "now".  A negative value is used to
   indicate seconds in the past from roughly "now".  A positive value is
   used to indicate the number of seconds, excluding leap seconds, since
   the start of the year 1970 in UTC.

   If only one of the Base Sum or Sum value is present, the missing
   field is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Sum and Sum
   values are added together to get the sum of measurement.  If neither
   the Base Sum or Sum are present, then the measurement does not have a
   sum value.

   If the Base Value or Value is not present, the missing field(s) are
   considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Value and Value are
   added together to get the value of the measurement.

   Representing the statistical characteristics of measurements, such as
   accuracy, can be very complex.  Future specification may add new
   fields to provide better information about the statistical properties
   of the measurement.

   In summary, the structure of a SenML record is laid out to support a
   single measurement per record.  If multiple data values are measured
   at the same time (e.g., air pressure and altitude), they are best
   kept as separate records linked through their Time value; this is
   even true where one of the data values is more "meta" than others
   (e.g., describes a condition that influences other measurements at
   the same time).

4.5.  Resolved Records

   Sometimes it is useful to be able to refer to a defined normalized
   format for SenML records.  This normalized format tends to get used
   for big data applications and intermediate forms when converting to
   other formats.

   A SenML Record is referred to as "resolved" if it does not contain
   any base values, i.e., labels starting with the character 'b', except
   for Version fields (see below), and has no relative times.  To
   resolve the records, the base values of the SenML Pack (if any) are
   applied to the Record.  That is, name and base name are concatenated,
   base time is added to the time of the Record, if the Record did not
   contain Unit the Base Unit is applied to the record, etc.  In
   addition the records need to be in chronological order.  An example
   of this is show in Section 5.1.4.

   The Version field MUST NOT be present in resolved records if the
   SenML version defined in this document is used and MUST be present
   otherwise in all the resolved SenML Records.

   Future specification that defines new base fields need to specify how
   the field is resolved.

4.6.  Associating Meta-data

   SenML is designed to carry the minimum dynamic information about
   measurements, and for efficiency reasons does not carry significant
   static meta-data about the device, object or sensors.  Instead, it is
   assumed that this meta-data is carried out of band.  For web
   resources using SenML Packs, this meta-data can be made available



Jennings, et al.        Expires September 3, 2018              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    SenML                       March 2018


   using the CoRE Link Format [RFC6690].  The most obvious use of this
   link format is to describe that a resource is available in a SenML
   format in the first place.  The relevant media type indicator is
   included in the Content-Type (ct=) link attribute (which is defined
   for the Link Format in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC7252]).

4.7.  Configuration and Actuation usage

   SenML can also be used for configuring parameters and controlling
   actuators.  When a SenML Pack is sent (e.g., using a HTTP/CoAP POST
   or PUT method) and the semantics of the target are such that SenML is
   interpreted as configuration/actuation, SenML Records are interpreted
   as a request to change the values of given (sub)resources (given as
   names) to given values at the given time(s).  The semantics of the
   target resource supporting this usage can be described, e.g., using
   [I-D.ietf-core-interfaces].  Examples of actuation usage are shown in
   Section 5.1.7.

5.  JSON Representation (application/senml+json)

   For the SenML fields shown in Table 2, the SenML labels are used as
   the JSON object member names within JSON objects representing the
   JSON SenML Records.

                    +---------------+-------+---------+

   The root JSON value consists of an array with one JSON object for
   each SenML Record.  All the fields in the above table MAY occur in
   the records with member values of the type specified in the table.

   Only the UTF-8 [RFC3629] form of JSON is allowed.  Characters in the
   String Value are encoded using the escape sequences defined in
   [RFC8259].  Octets in the Data Value are base64 encoded with URL safe
   alphabet as defined in Section 5 of [RFC4648], with padding omitted.

   Systems receiving measurements MUST be able to process the range of
   floating point numbers that are representable as an IEEE double
   precision floating point numbers [IEEE.754.1985].  This allows time
   values to have better than microsecond precision over the next 100
   years.  The number of significant digits in any measurement is not
   relevant, so a reading of 1.1 has exactly the same semantic meaning
   as 1.10.  If the value has an exponent, the "e" MUST be in lower
   case.  In the interest of avoiding unnecessary verbosity and speeding
   up processing, the mantissa SHOULD be less than 19 characters long
   and the exponent SHOULD be less than 5 characters long.

5.1.  Examples

5.1.1.  Single Datapoint

   The following shows a temperature reading taken approximately "now"
   by a 1-wire sensor device that was assigned the unique 1-wire address
   of 10e2073a01080063:

   [
     {"n":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063","u":"Cel","v":23.1}
   ]

5.1.2.  Multiple Datapoints

   The following example shows voltage and current now, i.e., at an
   unspecified time.

  {"n":"current","u":"A","v":1.2}
]

   The next example is similar to the above one, but shows current at
   Tue Jun 8 18:01:16.001 UTC 2010 and at each second for the previous 5
   seconds.

   Note that in some usage scenarios of SenML the implementations MAY
   store or transmit SenML in a stream-like fashion, where data is
   collected over time and continuously added to the object.  This mode
   of operation is optional, but systems or protocols using SenML in
   this fashion MUST specify that they are doing this.  SenML defines
   separate media types to indicate Sensor Streaming Measurement Lists
   (SensML) for this usage (see Section 12.3.2).  In this situation the
   SensML stream can be sent and received in a partial fashion, i.e., a
   measurement entry can be read as soon as the SenML Record is received
   and not have to wait for the full SensML Stream to be complete.

   For instance, the following stream of measurements may be sent via a
   long lived HTTP POST from the producer of a SensML to the consumer of
   that, and each measurement object may be reported at the time it was
   measured:

   device with a 1-wire address 10e2073a01080063, starting at Mon Oct 31
   13:24:24 UTC 2011.  The device also provides position data, which is
   provided in the same measurement or parameter array as separate
   entries.  Note time is used to for correlating data that belongs

   Finally, the device also reports extra data about its battery status
   at a separate time.

   as a result, a temperature and humidity measurement as well as the
   results from another device at http://[2001:db8::1] that also had a
   temperature and humidity.  Note that the last record would use the
   Base Name from the 3rd record but the Base Time from the first
   record.

5.1.7.  Setting an Actuator

   The following example show the SenML that could be used to set the
   current set point of a typical residential thermostat which has a
   temperature set point, a switch to turn on and off the heat, and a
   switch to turn on the fan override.

     {"n":"heat","u":"/","v":1},
     {"n":"fan","u":"/","v":0}
   ]

   In the following example two different lights are turned on.  It is
   assumed that the lights are on a network that can guarantee delivery
   of the messages to the two lights within 15 ms (e.g. a network using
   802.1BA [IEEE802.1ba-2011] and 802.1AS [IEEE802.1as-2011] for time
   synchronization).  The controller has set the time of the lights
   coming on to 20 ms in the future from the current time.  This allows
   both lights to receive the message, wait till that time, then apply
   the switch command so that both lights come on at the same time.

     {"bt":1.320078429e+09,"bu":"/","n":"2001:db8::3","v":1},
     {"n":"2001:db8::4","v":1}
   ]

   The following shows two lights being turned off using a non
   deterministic network that has a high odds of delivering a message in
   less than 100 ms and uses NTP for time synchronization.  The current
   time is 1320078429.  The user has just turned off a light switch
   which is turning off two lights.  Both lights are dimmed to 50%
   brightness immediately to give the user instant feedback that

   something is changing.  However given the network, the lights will
   probably dim at somewhat different times.  Then 100 ms in the future,
   both lights will go off at the same time.  The instant but not
   synchronized dimming gives the user the sensation of quick responses
   and the timed off 100 ms in the future gives the perception of both
   lights going off at the same time.

6.  CBOR Representation (application/senml+cbor)

   The CBOR [RFC7049] representation is equivalent to the JSON
   representation, with the following changes:

   o  For JSON Numbers, the CBOR representation can use integers,
      floating point numbers, or decimal fractions (CBOR Tag 4); however
      a representation SHOULD be chosen such that when the CBOR value is
      converted back to an IEEE double precision floating point value,
      it has exactly the same value as the original Number.  For the
      version number, only an unsigned integer is allowed.

   o  Characters in the String Value are encoded using a definite length
      text string (type 3).  Octets in the Data Value are encoded using
      a definite length byte string (type 2).

   o  For compactness, the CBOR representation uses integers for the
      labels, as defined in Table 4.  This table is conclusive, i.e.,
      there is no intention to define any additional integer map keys;
      any extensions will use string map keys.  This allows translators
      converting between CBOR and JSON representations to convert also
      all future labels without needing to update implementations.

   In CBOR diagnostic notation (Section 6 of [RFC7049]), this is:

  [{-2: "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a0108006:",
    -3: 1276020076.001, -4: "A", -1: 5, 0: "voltage", 1: "V", 2: 120.1},

7.  XML Representation (application/senml+xml)

   A SenML Pack or Stream can also be represented in XML format as
   defined in this section.

   Only the UTF-8 form of XML is allowed.  Characters in the String
   Value are encoded using the escape sequences defined in [RFC8259].
   Octets in the Data Value are base64 encoded with URL safe alphabet as
   defined in Section 5 of [RFC4648].

   The following example shows an XML example for the same sensor
   measurement as in Section 5.1.2.

   <sensml xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:senml">
     <senml bn="urn:dev:ow:10e2073a0108006:" bt="1.276020076001e+09"
     bu="A" bver="5" n="voltage" u="V" v="120.1"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-5" v="1.2"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-4" v="1.3"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-3" v="1.4"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-2" v="1.5"></senml>
     <senml n="current" t="-1" v="1.6"></senml>
     <senml n="current" v="1.7"></senml>
   </sensml>

   The SenML Stream is represented as a sensml element that contains a
   series of senml elements for each SenML Record.  The SenML fields are
   represented as XML attributes.  For each field defined in this
   document, the following table shows the SenML labels, which are used
   for the XML attribute name, as well as the according restrictions on
   the XML attribute values ("type") as used in the XML senml elements.

8.  EXI Representation (application/senml-exi)

   For efficient transmission of SenML over e.g. a constrained network,
   Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) can be used.  This encodes the XML
   Schema [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] structure of SenML into binary
   tags and values rather than ASCII text.  An EXI representation of
   SenML SHOULD be made using the strict schema-mode of EXI.  This mode
   however does not allow tag extensions to the schema, and therefore
   any extensions will be lost in the encoding.  For uses where
   extensions need to be preserved in EXI, the non-strict schema mode of
   EXI MAY be used.

   The EXI header MUST include an "EXI Options", as defined in
   [W3C.REC-exi-20140211], with an schemaId set to the value of "a"
   indicating the schema provided in this specification.  Future
   revisions to the schema can change the value of the schemaId to allow
   for backwards compatibility.  When the data will be transported over
   CoAP or HTTP, an EXI Cookie SHOULD NOT be used as it simply makes

   things larger and is redundant to information provided in the
   Content-Type header.

   The following is the XSD Schema to be used for strict schema guided
   EXI processing.  It is generated from the RelaxNG.

   Which compresses with EXI to the following displayed in hexdump:

 0000 a0 30 0d 84 80 f3 ab 93 71 d3 23 2b b1 d3 7b b9 |.0......q.#+..{.|

 003f

   The above example used the bit packed form of EXI but it is also
   possible to use a byte packed form of EXI which can makes it easier
   for a simple sensor to produce valid EXI without really implementing
   EXI.  Consider the example of a temperature sensor that produces a
   value in tenths of degrees Celsius over a range of 0.0 to 55.0.  It
   would produce an XML SenML file such as:

   <sensml xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:senml">
     <senml n="urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" u="Cel" v="23.1"></senml>
   </sensml>

   The compressed form, using the byte alignment option of EXI, for the
   above XML is the following:

 0000 a0 00 48 80 6c 20 01 06 1d 75 72 6e 3a 64 65 76 |..H.l ...urn:dev|
 0010 3a 6f 77 3a 31 30 65 32 30 37 33 61 30 31 30 38 |:ow:10e2073a0108|
 0020 30 30 36 33 02 05 43 65 6c 01 00 e7 01 01 00 03 |0063..Cel.......|
 0030 01                                              |.|
 0031

   A small temperature sensor device that only generates this one EXI
   file does not really need an full EXI implementation.  It can simply
   hard code the output replacing the 1-wire device ID starting at byte
   0x20 and going to byte 0x2F with it's device ID, and replacing the
   value "0xe7 0x01" at location 0x37 and 0x38 with the current
   temperature.  The EXI Specification [W3C.REC-exi-20140211] contains
   the full information on how floating point numbers are represented,
   but for the purpose of this sensor, the temperature can be converted
   to an integer in tenths of degrees (231 in this example).  EXI stores
   7 bits of the integer in each byte with the top bit set to one if
   there are further bytes.  So the first bytes at is set to low 7 bits
   of the integer temperature in tenths of degrees plus 0x80.  In this
   example 231 & 0x7F + 0x80 = 0xE7.  The second byte is set to the
   integer temperature in tenths of degrees right shifted 7 bits.  In
   this example 231 >> 7 = 0x01.

9.  Fragment Identification Methods

   A SenML Pack typically consists of multiple SenML Records and for
   some applications it may be useful to be able to refer with a
   Fragment Identifier to a single record, or a set of records, in a
   Pack.  The fragment identifier is only interpreted by a client and
   does not impact retrieval of a representation.  The SenML Fragment
   Identification is modeled after CSV Fragment Identifiers [RFC7111].

   To select a single SenML Record, the "rec" scheme followed by a
   single number is used.  For the purpose of numbering records, the
   first record is at position 1.  A range of records can be selected by
   giving the first and the last record number separated by a '-'
   character.  Instead of the second number, the '*' character can be
   used to indicate the last SenML Record in the Pack.  A set of records
   can also be selected using a comma separated list of record positions
   or ranges.

   (We use the term "selecting a record" for identifying it as part of
   the fragment, not in the sense of isolating it from the Pack -- the
   record still needs to be interpreted as part of the Pack, e.g., using
   the base values defined in earlier records)

9.1.  Fragment Identification Examples

   The 3rd SenML Record from "coap://example.com/temp" resource can be
   selected with:

   coap://example.com/temp#rec=3

   Records from 3rd to 6th can be selected with:

   coap://example.com/temp#rec=3-6

   Records from 19th to the last can be selected with:

   coap://example.com/temp#rec=19-*

   The 3rd and 5th record can be selected with:

   coap://example.com/temp#rec=3,5

   To select the Records from third to fifth, the 10th record, and all
   from 19th to the last:

   coap://example.com/temp#rec=3-5,10,19-*

10.  Usage Considerations

   The measurements support sending both the current value of a sensor
   as well as the an integrated sum.  For many types of measurements,
   the sum is more useful than the current value.  For example, an
   electrical meter that measures the energy a given computer uses will
   typically want to measure the cumulative amount of energy used.  This
   is less prone to error than reporting the power each second and
   trying to have something on the server side sum together all the
   power measurements.  If the network between the sensor and the meter
   goes down over some period of time, when it comes back up, the
   cumulative sum helps reflect what happened while the network was
   down.  A meter like this would typically report a measurement with
   the unit set to watts, but it would put the sum of energy used in the
   "s" field of the measurement.  It might optionally include the
   current power in the "v" field.

   While the benefit of using the integrated sum is fairly clear for
   measurements like power and energy, it is less obvious for something
   like temperature.  Reporting the sum of the temperature makes it easy
   to compute averages even when the individual temperature values are
   not reported frequently enough to compute accurate averages.
   Implementers are encouraged to report the cumulative sum as well as
   the raw value of a given sensor.

   Applications that use the cumulative sum values need to understand
   they are very loosely defined by this specification, and depending on
   the particular sensor implementation may behave in unexpected ways.
   Applications should be able to deal with the following issues:

   1.  Many sensors will allow the cumulative sums to "wrap" back to
       zero after the value gets sufficiently large.

   2.  Some sensors will reset the cumulative sum back to zero when the
       device is reset, loses power, or is replaced with a different
       sensor.

   3.  Applications cannot make assumptions about when the device
       started accumulating values into the sum.

   Typically applications can make some assumptions about specific
   sensors that will allow them to deal with these problems.  A common
   assumption is that for sensors whose measurement values are always
   positive, the sum should never get smaller; so if the sum does get
   smaller, the application will know that one of the situations listed
   above has happened.

12.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA" with
   the RFC number of this specification.

12.1.  Units Registry

   IANA will create a registry of SenML unit symbols.  The primary
   purpose of this registry is to make sure that symbols uniquely map to
   give type of measurement.  Definitions for many of these units can be
   found in location such as [NIST811] and [BIPM].  Units marked with an
   asterisk are NOT RECOMMENDED to be produced by new implementations,
   but are in active use and SHOULD be implemented by consumers that can
   use the related base units.

   o  Note 1: Assumed to be in WGS84 unless another reference frame is
      known for the sensor.

   o  Note 2: A value of 0.0 indicates the switch is off while 1.0
      indicates on and 0.5 would be half on.  The preferred name of this
      unit is "/".  For historical reasons, the name "%" is also
      provided for the same unit - but note that while that name
      strongly suggests a percentage (0..100) -- it is however NOT a
      percentage, but the absolute ratio!

   New entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as
   defined in [RFC8126].  Experts should exercise their own good
   judgment but need to consider the following guidelines:

   1.   There needs to be a real and compelling use for any new unit to
        be added.

   2.   Each unit should define the semantic information and be chosen
        carefully.  Implementers need to remember that the same word may
        be used in different real-life contexts.  For example, degrees
        when measuring latitude have no semantic relation to degrees
        when measuring temperature; thus two different units are needed.

   3.   These measurements are produced by computers for consumption by
        computers.  The principle is that conversion has to be easily be
        done when both reading and writing the media type.  The value of
        a single canonical representation outweighs the convenience of
        easy human representations or loss of precision in a conversion.

   4.   Use of SI prefixes such as "k" before the unit is not
        recommended.  Instead one can represent the value using
        scientific notation such a 1.2e3.  The "kg" unit is exception to
        this rule since it is an SI base unit; the "g" unit is provided
        for legacy compatibility.

   5.   For a given type of measurement, there will only be one unit
        type defined.  So for length, meters are defined and other
        lengths such as mile, foot, light year are not allowed.  For
        most cases, the SI unit is preferred.

        (Note that some amount of judgment will be required here, as
        even SI itself is not entirely consistent in this respect.  For
        instance, for temperature [ISO-80000-5] defines a quantity, item
        5-1 (thermodynamic temperature), and a corresponding unit 5-1.a
        (Kelvin), and then goes ahead to define another quantity right
        besides that, item 5-2 ("Celsius temperature"), and the
        corresponding unit 5-2.a (degree Celsius).  The latter quantity
        is defined such that it gives the thermodynamic temperature as a
        delta from T0 = 275.15 K.  ISO 80000-5 is defining both units
        side by side, and not really expressing a preference.  This
        level of recognition of the alternative unit degree Celsius is
        the reason why Celsius temperatures exceptionally seem
        acceptable in the SenML units list alongside Kelvin.)

   6.   Symbol names that could be easily confused with existing common
        units or units combined with prefixes should be avoided.  For
        example, selecting a unit name of "mph" to indicate something
        that had nothing to do with velocity would be a bad choice, as
        "mph" is commonly used to mean miles per hour.

   7.   The following should not be used because the are common SI
        prefixes: Y, Z, E, P, T, G, M, k, h, da, d, c, n, u, p, f, a, z,
        y, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi, Ei, Zi, Yi.

   8.   The following units should not be used as they are commonly used
        to represent other measurements Ky, Gal, dyn, etg, P, St, Mx, G,
        Oe, Gb, sb, Lmb, mph, Ci, R, RAD, REM, gal, bbl, qt, degF, Cal,
        BTU, HP, pH, B/s, psi, Torr, atm, at, bar, kWh.

   9.   The unit names are case sensitive and the correct case needs to
        be used, but symbols that differ only in case should not be
        allocated.

   10.  A number after a unit typically indicates the previous unit
        raised to that power, and the / indicates that the units that
        follow are the reciprocal.  A unit should have only one / in the
        name.

   11.  A good list of common units can be found in the Unified Code for
        Units of Measure [UCUM].

   Table 7: IANA Registry for SenML Labels, CL = CBOR Label, EI = EXI ID

   This is the same table as Table 1, with notes removed, and with
   columns added for the information that is all the same for this
   initial set of registrations, but will need to be supplied with a
   different value for new registrations.

   Note to RFC Editor.  Please replace RFCXXXX with the number for this
   RFC.

   All new entries must define the Label Name, Label, and XML Type but
   the CBOR labels SHOULD be left empty as CBOR will use the string
   encoding for any new labels.  The EI column contains the EXI schemaId
   value of the first Schema which includes this label or is empty if
   this label was not intended for use with EXI.  The Note field SHOULD
   contain information about where to find out more information about
   this label.

   The JSON, CBOR, and EXI types are derived from the XML type.  All XML
   numeric types such as double, float, integer and int become a JSON
   Number.  XML boolean and string become a JSON Boolean and String
   respectively.  CBOR represents numeric values with a CBOR type that
   does not lose any information from the JSON value.  EXI uses the XML
   types.

   New entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as
   defined in [RFC8126].  Experts should exercise their own good
   judgment but need to consider that shorter labels should have more
   strict review.  New entries should not be made that counteract the
   advice at the end of Section 4.4.

   All new SenML labels that have "base" semantics (see Section 4.1)
   MUST start with the character 'b'.  Regular labels MUST NOT start
   with that character.

   Extensions that add a label that is intended for use with XML need to
   create a new RelaxNG scheme that includes all the labels in the IANA
   registry.

   Extensions that add a label that is intended for use with EXI need to
   create a new XSD Schema that includes all the labels in the IANA
   registry and then allocate a new EXI schemaId value.  Moving to the
   next letter in the alphabet is the suggested way to create the new
   value for the EXI schemaId.  Any labels with previously blank ID
   values SHOULD be updated in the IANA table to have their ID set to
   this new schemaId value.

   Extensions that are mandatory to understand to correctly process the
   Pack MUST have a label name that ends with the '_' character.

12.3.  Media Type Registrations

   The following registrations are done following the procedure
   specified in [RFC6838] and [RFC7303].  This document registers media
   types for each serialization format of SenML (JSON, CBOR, and EXI)
   and also media types for the same formats of the streaming use
   (SensML).  Clipboard formats are defined for the JSON and XML form of
   lists but do not make sense for streams or other formats.

   Note to RFC Editor - please remove this paragraph.  Note that a
   request for media type review for senml+json was sent to the media-
   types@iana.org on Sept 21, 2010.  A second request for all the types
   was sent on October 31, 2016.  Please change all instances of RFC-
   AAAA with the RFC number of this document.

12.3.1.  senml+json Media Type Registration

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: senml+json

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
   encoding allowed in [RFC8259].  See RFC-AAAA for details.  This
   simplifies implementation of very simple system and does not impose
   any significant limitations as all this data is meant for machine to
   machine communications and is not meant to be human readable.

   Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC-AAAA.

   Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any JSON
   key value pairs that they do not understand unless the key ends with
   the '_' character in which case an error MUST be generated.  This
   allows backwards compatible extensions to this specification.  The
   "bver" field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal
   level of functionality needed by the creator of the JSON object.

   Published specification: RFC-AAAA

   Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
   that report e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
   information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
   wide range of sensor reporting systems.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
   application/senml+json is supported by using fragment identifiers as
   specified by RFC-AAAA.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s): none

   File extension(s): senml

   Windows Clipboard Name: "JSON Sensor Measurement List"

   Macintosh file type code(s): none

12.3.2.  sensml+json Media Type Registration

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: sensml+json

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
   encoding allowed in [RFC8259].  See RFC-AAAA for details.  This
   simplifies implementation of very simple system and does not impose
   any significant limitations as all this data is meant for machine to
   machine communications and is not meant to be human readable.

   Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC-AAAA.

   Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any JSON
   key value pairs that they do not understand unless the key ends with
   the '_' character in which case an error MUST be generated.  This
   allows backwards compatible extensions to this specification.  The
   "bver" field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal
   level of functionality needed by the creator of the JSON object.

   Published specification: RFC-AAAA

   Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
   that report e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
   information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
   wide range of sensor reporting systems.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
   application/senml+json is supported by using fragment identifiers as
   specified by RFC-AAAA.

13.  Security Considerations

   Sensor data can contain a wide range of information ranging from
   information that is very public, such as the outside temperature in a
   given city, to very private information that requires integrity and
   confidentiality protection, such as patient health information.  The
   SenML formats do not provide any security and instead rely on the
   protocol that carries them to provide security.  Applications using
   SenML need to look at the overall context of how these media types
   will be used to decide if the security is adequate.  The SenML
   formats defined by this specification do not contain any executable
   content.  However, future extensions could potentially embed
   application specific executable content in the data.

   See also Section 14.

14.  Privacy Considerations

   Sensor data can range from information with almost no security
   considerations, such as the current temperature in a given city, to
   highly sensitive medical or location data.  This specification
   provides no security protection for the data but is meant to be used
   inside another container or transport protocol such as S/MIME
   [RFC5751] or HTTP with TLS [RFC5246] that can provide integrity,
   confidentiality, and authentication information about the source of
   the data.

   The name fields need to uniquely identify the sources or destinations
   of the values in a SenML Pack.  However, the use of long-term stable
   unique identifiers can be problematic for privacy reasons [RFC6973],
   depending on the application and the potential of these identifiers
   to be used in correlation with other information.  They should be
   used with care or avoided as for example described for IPv6 addresses
   in [RFC7721].
