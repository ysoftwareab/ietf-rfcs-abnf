Internet-Draft       Warranty Certificate Extension         April 2002


1. Introduction

  The warranty certificate extension identifies the warranty policy
  associated with a X.509 public key certificate [X.509-97, PROFILE].
  Often the Certificate Authority (CA) will obtain an insurance policy
  to ensure coverage of the warranty.

  The certificate warranty provides an extended monetary coverage for
  the legal liability of the CA, in favor of the subscriber.  The
  certificate warranty primarily concerns the use, storage, and reliance
  on a certificate by a third party and the CA.  It is common for a CA
  to limit liability by establishing reliance limits on the use of a
  certificate.  It is not uncommon for a CA to attempt through
  contractual means to exclude its liability entirely.  However, this
  has the effect of undermining the confidence that commerce requires to
  gainfully use certificates.

  Alternatively a CA may provide extended liability coverage for the use
  of the certificate.  Usually, the subscriber pays for the extended
  warranty coverage.  In turn, subscribers are covered by an
  appropriately drafted insurance policy.  The certificate warranty is
  backed by an insurance policy issued by a licensed insurance company,
  which results in a financial backing that is far greater than that of
  the CA.  This extra financial backing provides a further element of
  confidence necessary to encourage the use of certificates in commerce.

  When a certificate contains a warranty certificate extension, the
  extension MUST be non-critical, and it MUST contain base warranty
  data.  The extension MAY contain optional qualifiers.

2. Warranty Extension Format

  Like all X.509 certificate extensions, the warranty certificate
  extension is defined using ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88].

  The non-critical warranty extension is identified by
  id-pe-warrantyData.

     id-pe-warrantyData OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-pe <<TBD>> }

  The warranty always includes a base warranty.  The warranty
  information includes the period during which the warranty applies, a
  warranty value, and a warranty type.  The warranty type tells the
  liability limitations against claims.  The extension definition
  supports two alternatives: aggregated and per-transaction.  With
  aggregation, claims are fulfilled until a ceiling value is reached.
  After that, no further claims are fulfilled.  With per-transaction, a
  ceiling value is imposed on each claim, but each transaction is

  considered independently.

  The warranty extension permits inclusion of two optional warranty 
  qualifiers. The first qualifier provides extended warranty information. 
  The second qualifier provides a pointer to the warranty terms and 
  conditions.

  When present, the extended warranty information provides information
  about coverage beyond the scope of the base warranty.  Like the base
  warranty information, the extended warranty information includes
  period during which the warranty applies, a warranty value, and a
  warranty type.

  When present, the terms and conditions pointer provides a reference to
  a document containing the terms and conditions associated with the
  warranty.  The pointer is always a uniform resource locator (URL).
  The URL MUST be a non-relative URL, and it MUST follow the URL syntax
  and encoding rules specified in RFC 1738 [URL].

2.1. Warranty Extension Syntax

  The syntax for the warranty extension is:

     Warranty  ::=  CHOICE  {
       none                 NULL,            -- No warranty provided
       wData                WarrantyData  }  -- Explicit warranty

     WarrantyData  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       base                 WarrantyInfo,
       extended             WarrantyInfo OPTIONAL,
       tcURL                TermsAndConditionsURL OPTIONAL  }

     WarrantyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       validity             WarrantyValidityPeriod,
       amount               CurrencyAmount,
       wType                WarrantyType  }

     WarrantyValidityPeriod  ::=  CHOICE  {
       sameAsCertificate    NULL,
       explicitPeriod       ValidityPeriod  }

     ValidityPeriod  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       notBefore            GeneralizedTime,
       notAfter             GeneralizedTime  }

     -- CurrencyAmount specifies the currency and a monetary value.
     -- Currency codes are defined in ISO 4217.  The monetary value
     -- is: amount * (10 ** amtExp10), and the exponent MUST be the
     -- minor unit of currency specified in ISO 4217.

     CurrencyAmount  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       currency             INTEGER (1..999),
       amount               INTEGER (0..MAX),
       amtExp10             INTEGER (0..MAX)  }

     WarrantyType  ::=  INTEGER  {
       aggregated           (0),
       perTransaction       (1)  }

     TermsAndConditionsURL  ::=  IA5String

2.2. Warranty Extension Semantics

  Warranty is a CHOICE; it is represented either by NULL or
  WarrantyData.  If the CA selects NULL, then the CA is explicitly
  stating that no warranty is provided.  If the CA selects WarrantyData,
  then the CA is explicitly stating that a warranty is provided, and the
  fields within the WarrantyData type MUST provide details about the
  warranty that is provided.

  WarrantyData MUST contain information about the base warranty.
  WarrantyData MAY contain information about an extended warranty.  Both
  base warranty and extended warranty information is provided using the
  WarrantyInfo type.  WarrantyData MAY contain a URL that points to the
  terms and conditions of the warranty.  The URL is provided using the
  TermsAndConditionsURL type, which is an IA5 string.

  WarrantyInfo MUST contain the warranty validity period, the currency
  amount of the warranty, and the type of warranty.  The warranty
  validity period is provided using the WarrantyValidityPeriod type.
  The currency amount of the warranty is provided using the
  CurrencyAmount type.  The type of warranty is provided using the
  WarrantyType type.

  WarrantyValidityPeriod is a CHOICE; it is represented either by NULL
  or ValidityPeriod.  If the CA selects NULL, then the validity period
  of the warranty MUST be exactly the same as the validity period of the
  certificate.  If the CA selects ValidityPeriod, then the CA is
  explicitly stating a warranty validity period that is different than
  the validity period of the certificate.  If the warranty validity
  period and the certificate validity period are the same, then the CA
  MUST select the NULL choice.  The validity periods are expected to be
  the same in the vast majority of the cases.

  ValidityPeriod is a SEQUENCE of two GeneralizedTime values.  The first
  (notBefore) GeneralizedTime value MUST indicate the date and time that
  the warranty become valid, and the second (notAfter) GeneralizedTime
  value MUST indicate the date and time that the warranty expires.

  CurrencyAmount is a SEQUENCE if three integers.  Together the integers
  specify the currency and a monetary value.  The first integer
  (currency) MUST indicate the currency using one of the currency codes
  defined in ISO 4217.  The second integer (amount) MUST indicate the
  value of the warranty.  The third integer (amtExp10) MUST indicate the
  correct placement of the decimal point in the monetary value, and it
  MUST be the minor unit of currency specified in ISO 4217.  For example
  $48,525.50 (in US dollars) is represented as:
     currency =      840
     amount   =  4852550
     amtExp10 =        2

  WarrantyType is an integer.  A value of zero indicates that claims
  against the warranty will be aggregated, and once the value of
  fulfilled claims reaches the warranty currency amount, then no further
  claim will be fulfilled.  A value of one indicates that each claim is
  handled independently, but no individual claim can exceed the warranty
  currency amount.  The CA MUST select either zero or one for this
  integer value.

3. Security Considerations

  The procedures and practices employed by the CA MUST ensure that the
  correct values for the warranty are inserted in each certificate that is
  issued.  Relying parties and users may accept or reject a particular
  certificate for an intended use based on the information provided in
  warranty extension.  Incorrect representation of the actual warranty
  may result in unexpected liabilities for the CA.
