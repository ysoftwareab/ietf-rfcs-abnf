          External Keys And Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                 draft-ounsworth-pq-external-pubkeys-00

Abstract

   Many of the post quantum cryptographic algorithms have either large
   public keys or signatures.  In the interest of reducing bandwidth of
   transitting X.509 certificates, this document defines new public key
   and signature algorithms for referencing external public key and
   signature data by hash, URL, etc.  This mechanism is designed to
   mimic the behaviour of an Authority Information Access extension.

1.  Introduction

2.  External Value

   The id-external-value algorithm identifier is used for identifying a
   public key or signature which is provided as a reference to external
   data.

   id-external-value ::= < OID >

   The corresponding subjectPublicKey is the DER encoding of the
   following structure:

   ExternalValue ::= SEQUENCE {
     location     GeneralName,
     hashAlg      AlgorithmIdentifier,
     hashVal      BIT STRING
   }

   Upon retrieval of the referenced data, the hash of the OCTET STRING
   of the retrieved data (removing base64 encoding as per [RFC4648] if
   necessary) MUST be verified using hashAlg to match the
   ExternalPublicKey.hash value.

2.1.  External Public Key

   When used with a public key, algorithm parameters for id-external-
   value are absent.

   When ExternalValue is placed into a
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey, the ExternalValue.location
   MUST refer to a DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo, which MAY be base64
   encoded as per [RFC4648] for easier transport over text protocols.

2.2.  External Signature

   When used with a signatureAlgorithm, algorithm parameters are to
   contain the AlgorithmIdentifier of the signature that is being
   externalized.

   When ExternalValue is placed into a signatureValue, the location MUST
   refer to the BIT STRING of a signatureValue, which MAY be base64
   encoded as per [RFC4648] for easier transport over text protocols.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.  The id-alg-composite OID is to be
   assigned by IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  CSRs and CT logs

   In practice, situations will arise where the
   ExternalPublicKey.location refers to a location which is not publicly
   available either because it is in a local keystore, on a private
   network, or no longer being hosted.

   Not having the public key in a certificate signing request (CSR)
   could make it substantially harder for CAs to perform vetting of the
   key, for example for cryptographic strength or checking for prior
   revocation due to key compromise.  A certificate requester MUST make
   the full public key available to the CA at the time of certificate
   request either by ensuring that the link in the
   ExternalPublicKey.location is visible to the CA, or by supplying the
   full public key to the CA out of band.

   Not having the public key in Certificate Transparency (CT) logs could
   make it substantially harder for researchers to perform auditing
   tasks on CT logs.  This may require additional CT mechanisms.
