                Extending OSPFv3 to Support Multi-homing
                   draft-xu-ospf-multi-homing-ipv6-00

Abstract

   Traditionally, routing protocols make routing decisions solely based
   on destination IP addresses, packets towards the same destination
   will be delivered to the same next hop no matter where they come
   from.  These protocols work well with simple networks that have only
   one egress router.  However, in the multi-homing scenario, packets
   may be dropped if forwarded only based on destination addresses.

   This document defines enhancements to the OSPFv3 protocol that allow
   simple and flexible operations, with which packets will be routed
   towards the corresponding upstream ISPs based on both destination and
   source addresses.

1.  Introduction

   Networks are growing both in device count and in complexity.  Today
   they are generally connected with multiple upstream providers, and
   may require routing to place audio/visual entertainment traffic one
   one path, office services on another.  Traditionally, we have

Internet-Draft  Extending OSPFv3 to Support Multi-homing    October 2015


   simplified networks using a single exit router.  Increasingly, such
   networks are multi-homed.

   Traditionally, routing protocols make routing decisions solely based
   on destination IP addresses, packets towards the same destination
   will be delivered to the same next hop no matter where they come
   from.  These protocols work well with simple networks that have only
   one egress router.  However, in the multi-homing scenario, packets
   may be dropped if forwarded only based on destination addresses
   [RFC3704].

   Although many patch-like solutions, like static routing, policy-based
   routing (PBR), multi-topology routing (MTR) and layer-3 VPN can solve
   the problem, they complex the configurations in networks, and are not
   suitable for ISP administrators.  We need a simple solution to help
   administrators manage their networks in the multi-homing scenario.

   In this document, we define enhancements to OSPFv3 that allow
   networks route packets towards the corresponding upstream ISPs,
   according to both destination and source addresses.  The enhancements
   defined in this memo are backward-compatible with the OSPFv3
   specification defined in [RFC5340], and with the OSPF extensions
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend]

2.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document:

   o  Traffic Class (TC): Identified by (destination prefix, source
      prefix), all packets falling in the domain belong to the traffic
      class.

   o  TC-Route: Identified by (destination prefix, source prefix,
      value), where value is the administrative value applied to the
      traffic class (destination prefix, source prefix).

   o  TC-LSA: Link state advertisement that communicates the
      reachability for a traffic classes.

3.  Overview

   Traditionally, egress routers obtain delegated prefixes from upstream
   ISPs using DHCPv6 with prefix options [RFC3633].  The egress routers
   will then assign longer sub-prefixes to the other links in the
   network.  Each router inside the network will act as standard OSPFv3
   router, and forward packets based on their destination addresses.

   With traffic class routing, after obtaining delegated prefixes and
   assigning sub-prefixes, egress routers will populate traffic classes
   (with extended LSAs), rather than destination address only, into the
   network.  Each internal router will flood these traffic classes
   information.  When calculating the path towards a destination
   address, routers will take the traffic classes into considerations.
   Intrinsically, in traditional routing model, the object being routed
   to is a destination prefix; in the new routing model, the object
   being routed might be a destination prefix given that the packet
   sports a certain source prefix.

   Each traffic class is associated with a cost, which is a single
   dimensionless metric.

   For example, as shown in Figure 1, a site is connected to the
   Internet through two ISPs, ISP1 and ISP2.  ISP1 delegates prefix P1
   to the site, and ISP2 delegates prefix P2 to the site.  After being
   delegated with P1, the egress router E1 of the site will advertise a
   traffic class - {::/0, P1}, into the site.  After being delegated
   with P2, the egress router E2 of the site will advertise a traffic
   class - {::/0, P2}, into the site.  Receiving these advertisements,
   interior router I1 will compute two paths towards ::/0, one through
   router E1 for traffic from P1, the other through E2 for traffic from
   P2.

4.  Router Behavior

   All routers behave like traditional OSPFv3 routers, however, the
   following behaviors are different with traditional OSPFv3 routers.

4.1.  Egress Router Behavior

   After obtaining delegated prefixes using DHCPv6 with prefix options,
   an egress router should originate TC-LSAs, i.e., extended LSAs with
   source prefixes appended.  Egress routers then will advertise these
   TC-LSAs into the network.

   Note that an egress router behaves like an interior router if it
   receives a TC-LSA from other egress routers.

4.2.  Interior Router Behavior

   Receiving TC-LSAs from egress routers, an interior router should
   store the TC-LSAs into its LSDB, and flood it to other routers.
   After calculating a path to an egress router advertising
   reachability, i.e., a destination prefix, the interior router should
   decide which traffic class can follow this path towards the egress

Internet-Draft  Extending OSPFv3 to Support Multi-homing    October 2015


   router.  If a traffic class can travel through two different paths,
   then interior router should compare their costs, and select the path
   with the lowest cost.

   Interior routers contains a routing table that contains all necessary
   information to forward an IP packet following the path of a traffic
   class.  After computing the path towards a traffic class, interior
   routers should update the entry in the routing table if necessary,
   e.g., change the next hop towards the traffic class.  The routing
   table structure will be described in Section 6.  Calculation of
   routing table will be illustrated in Section 7.

   At last, interior routers should update the Forwarding Information
   Base (FIB), which will be discussed in the next version of this
   document.

5.  TC-LSA Format

   TC-LSA adds TLV extensions, which contains source prefix information,
   based on original OSPFv3 LSA.  We follow the TLV format in
   [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing] and extended LSA format in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend].

   Each extended LSA includes the traditional LSA part in [RFC5340], and
   one or more TLVs defined in [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing].
   But we do not need all LSAs to be extended, the LSAs need to be
   extended are as follows:

   o  Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA: The extended LSA has type 0x2029.

   The extended LSA format for Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA in multi-homing is
   shown in Figure 2.

   o  LSA length: The length of the whole LSA header, including the
      TLVs;

   o  TLV type: The type of IPv6 source prefix TLV, assigned by IANA;

   o  TLV length: The value is 20 as defined in
      [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing];

   o  SPrefixLength, SPrefixOptions, Source Address Prefix:
      Representation of the IPv6 address prefix, which is delegated from
      the upstream ISP providers;

   In the extended LSA, suppose there are n destination prefix d1, d2,
   ..., dn, and 1 source prefix s, then the LSA carries n TC-route
   announcement, (d1, s, v1), (d2, s, v2), ..., (dn, s, vn), where vi is
   the metric associated with destination prefix di.

6.  Routing Table Structure

   For traditional routing, the routing table structure contains all
   needed information to forward IP packets to the right destination.
   For example, destination prefixes are commonly structured into a
   prefix trie, where each trie nodes contain the necessary information.
   Routers can lookup and update the prefix trie.

   With traffic classes, the routing table structure must contain all
   needed information to forward IP packets following the right traffic
   class, i.e., towards the related destination and from the related
   source.  For each routing table entry, there are two additional
   fields other than the fields mentioned in [RFC5340]:

   o  Source IP Address: The IP address of the source in traffic class.

   o  Source Address Mask: If the source is a subnet, then it is
      referred to as the subnet mask.

   The routing table must provide interface for update and lookup in it.
   For example, traffic classes can be structured into a two dimensional
   (or two level) trie, where each trie node in the first dimension
   points to a sub-trie in the second dimension.  The trie nodes in the
   second dimension contain the necessary information to forward IP
   packets following the right traffic class.

   There exist multiple implementation in real routers.  For example, 1)
   we can add an additional routing table besides the destination-based
   routing table; 2) the destination-based routing table can be extended
   to support the new structure, in which case all destination-based
   rule can be appended with a wildcard IPv6 address prefix as the

Internet-Draft  Extending OSPFv3 to Support Multi-homing    October 2015


   source prefix.  The specific implementation for routing table is out
   of scope of this document.

7.  Calculation of the Routing Table

   The fundamental algorithm in OSPFv3 doesn't change.  The algorithm
   uses the SPF approach to calculate a path to the router advertising
   reachability, and then uses the reachability advertisement to decide
   what traffic should follow that route.  What we are changing is the
   reachability advertisement, in traiditional OSPFv3, the
   advertisements, which is one or several kinds of LSAs, represent
   destination prefixes; in this document, the advertisements, which is
   one or several kinds of TC-LSAs, represent traffic classes.

   Note that we do not have to change router-LSA and network-LSA in
   [RFC5340].  Thus, the first stage of Section 4.8.1 in [RFC5340]
   remains the same in this document.  However, the second stage of
   Section 4.8.1 in [RFC5340] should change by a little bit.  Instead of
   examining the list of the intra-area-prefix-LSAs, the list of
   extended intra-area-prefix-LSAs is examined.  The cost of any
   advertised traffic class is the sum of the class' advertised metric
   plus the cost of the transit vertex (either router or transit
   network) indentified by extended intra-area-prefix-LSAs' referenced
   LS type, referenced link state ID, and referenced advertising router
   field.

8.  Matching Rule

   We also adopt the LMF (longest match first) rule when a packet
   matches multiple routing entries.  However, traffic class has two
   dimensions, there might exist ambiguity.  For example, if there
   exists two routing entries, (d1, s1, nexthop1), (d2, s2, nexthop2),
   where d1 is longer than d2 and s2 is longer than s1, then none entry
   is longer than the other in both dimensions.  In this situation, we
   must insert an additional entry into the routing table, e.g., (d1,
   s2, nexthop1) in the above example.  The entry directs to nexthop1
   rather than nexthop2, because we must guarantee consistency among
   routers.

9.  Compatibility

   With the enhancements, incremental deployment is possible.  The un-
   deployed routers act according to [RFC5340], and will drop the
   extended LSA packets when receiving them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The newly LSA types and TLVs should be assigned by IANA, please refer
   to [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing] and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend].
