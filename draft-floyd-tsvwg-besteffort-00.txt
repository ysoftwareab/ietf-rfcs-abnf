Abstract

   This document presents some observations on "simple best-effort"
   traffic, defined loosely for the purposes of this document as
   Internet traffic that is not covered by Quality of Service

   mechanisms, congestion-based pricing, or the like.  One observation
   is that simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the
   Internet, and is worth keeping.  While traffic with Quality of
   Service mechanisms, congestion-based pricing, or the like can also be
   useful, we believe that they are useful as **adjuncts** to simple
   best-effort traffic, not as **replacements** of simple best-effort
   traffic.  A second observation is that for simple best-effort
   traffic, some form of rough flow rate fairness is a useful goal for
   resource allocation, where "flow rate fairness" is defined by the
   goal of equal flow rates for different flows.

1.  Introduction

   This document gives some observations on the role of simple best-
   effort traffic in the Internet.  We define the term "simple best-
   effort traffic" to avoid unproductive semantic discussions about
   whether the phrase "best-effort traffic" does or does not include
   traffic with cost-based fairness or some other form of congestion-
   based pricing.  For the purposes of this document, we define "simple
   best-effort traffic" as traffic that does not *rely* on the
   *differential treatment* of flows either in routers or in policers,
   enforcers, or other middleboxes along the path.  "Simple best-effort
   traffic" in the current Internet uses end-to-end transport protocols
   (e.g., TCP, UDP, or others), with minimal requirements within the



Floyd                                                           [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   network in terms of resource allocation.  However, that is not the
   only possible implementation of a simple best-effort service.  As an
   example, "simple best-effort traffic" could also be implemented in an
   infrastructure with Fair Queueing scheduling in congested routers.
   "Simple best-effort traffic" is the dominant traffic class in the
   current Internet.

   In contrast to "simple best-effort traffic", intserv or diffserv-
   enabled traffic relies on differential scheduling mechanisms at
   congested routers, with packets from different intserv or diffserv
   classes receiving different treatment.  Similarly, in contrast to
   "simple best-effort traffic", cost-based fairness [B07] would most
   likely require the deployment of traffic marking (e.g., ECN) at
   congested routers, along with policing mechanisms near the two ends
   of the connection providing differential treatment for packets in
   different flows or in different traffic classes.  Intserv/diffserv,
   cost-based fairness, and congestion-based pricing would also require
   complex economic relationships among Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs), and between end-users and ISPs.

   This document suggests that it is important to retain the class of
   "simple best-effort traffic" (though hopefully augmented by a wider
   deployment of other classes of service).  Further, this document
   suggests that some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a perfectly
   appropriate goal for simple best-effort traffic.  We do not argue in
   this document that flow-rate fairness is the *only possible* or *only
   desirable* resource allocation goal for simple best-effort traffic.
   We would maintain, however, that it is an appropriate resource
   allocation goal for simple best-effort traffic in the current
   Internet, evolving from the Internet's past of TCP and UDP.

   This document was motivated by [B07], an internet-draft on "Flow Rate
   Fairness: Dismantling a Religion" that asserts in the abstract that
   "Comparing flow rates should never again be used for claims of
   fairness in production networks."  This document does not attempt to
   be a rebuttal to [B07], or to answer any or all of the issues raised
   in [B07], or to give the "intellectual heritage" for flow-based
   fairness in philosophy or social science, or to commit the authors of
   this document to an extended dialogue with the author of [B07].  This
   document is simply a separate viewpoint on some related topics.

2.  On Simple Best-Effort Traffic

   This section makes some observations on the usefulness and
   limitations of the class of simple best-effort traffic, in comparison
   with QoS-enabled traffic, traffic with cost-based fairness or
   congestion-based pricing, and the like.




Floyd                                                           [Page 3]

2.1.  The Usefulness of Simple Best-Effort Traffic

   This section discusses some of the useful aspects of simple best-
   effort traffic.

   Minimal technical demands on the network infrastructure:

      Simple best-effort traffic, as implemented in the current
      Internet, makes minimal technical demands on the infrastructure.
      There are no technical requirements for scheduling mechanisms and
      queue management mechanisms in routers, or for enforcement
      mechanisms along the path.  This is a source of many of the
      weaknesses as well as many of the strengths of simple best-effort
      traffic.

   Minimal demands in terms of economic infrastructure:

      Simple best-effort traffic makes minimal demands in terms of
      economic infrastructure, relying on fairly simple pair-wise
      economic relationships among ISPs, and between users and their
      immediate ISPs.

   Usefulness in the real world:

      The Internet is chugging along, however imperfectly.  As discussed
      below, simple best-effort traffic is not optimal.  However,
      experience in the Internet has shown that there is value in having
      a mechanism that generally allows all users to get a portion of
      the resources, while still preventing congestion collapse.


2.2.  The Limitations of Simple Best-Effort Traffic

   This section discusses some of the limitations of simple best-effort
   traffic.


2.2.1.  QoS

   Some users would be happy to pay for more bandwidth, less delay, less
   jitter, or fewer packet drops.  It is desirable to accommodate such
   goals in the Internet architecture while preserving a sufficient
   amount of bandwidth for best-effort traffic.

   One of the obvious dangers of simple implementations of QoS
   mechanisms or of cost-based fairness, in the absence of the
   protection of simple best-effort traffic, would be that the users
   with more money *could* end up completely shutting out users with



Floyd                                                           [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   less money in times of congestion.  There seems to be fairly
   widespread agreement that this would not be a desirable goal.


   As a sample of the range of positions, the Internet Society's
   Internet 2020 Initiative, entitled "The Internet is (still) for
   Everyone", states that "we remain committed to the openness that
   ensures equal access and full participation for every user"
   [Internet2020].

   The wide-ranging discussion of "network neutrality" in the United
   States includes advocates of several different positions, including
   that of "absolute non-discrimination" (with no QoS considerations),
   "limited discrimination without QoS tiering" (no fees charged for
   higher-quality service), and "limited discrimination and tiering"
   (including higher fees allowed for QoS) [NetNeutral].  The proponents
   of "network neutrality" are all opposed to charging based on content
   (e.g., based on applications, or the content provider).

   As the "network neutrality" discussion should make clear, there are
   many voices in the discussion that would disagree with a resource
   allocation goal of maximizing the combined aggregate utility,
   particularly where a user's utility is measured by the user's
   willingness to pay.  "You get what you pay for" does not seem to be
   the consensus goal for resource allocation in the Internet, either in
   the IETF or in the commercial or political realms of the Internet.

   [Add citations of papers about the importance of the role of the
   high-priced services in financing the infrastructure.]

   Briscoe argues for cost-fairness [B07], so that senders are made
   accountable for the congestion they cause.  There are, of course,
   differences of opinion about how well cost-based fairness could be
   enforced, and how well it fits the commercial reality of the
   Internet, with [B07] presenting an optimistic view.

   With *only* best-effort traffic, there would be fundamental
   limitations to the performance that real-time applications could
   deliver to their users.  In addition to the obvious needs for high
   bandwidth, low delay or jitter, or low packet drop rates, some
   applications would like a fast start-up, or to be able to resume
   their old high sending rate after a relatively-long idle period, or
   to be able to rely on a call-setup procedure so that the application
   is not even started if network resources are not sufficient.  There
   are severe limitations to how effectively these requirements can be
   accommodated by simple best-effort service in a congested
   environment.

2.2.2.  The Enforcement of Fairness

   As discussed in Section 3.2 below, there are well-known problems with
   the enforcement of fairness with simple best-effort traffic (whatever
   "fairness" goal is used for bandwidth allocation for the simple best-
   effort traffic), and with enforcement of mechanisms for the avoidance
   of congestion collapse [RFC2914].

3.  On Flow-Rate Fairness for Simple Best-Effort Traffic

   This section argues that rough flow-rate fairness is a perfectly
   acceptable goal for simple best-effort traffic.  This section does
   not, however, claim that flow-rate fairness is necessarily an
   *optimal* fairness goal or resource allocation mechanism for simple
   best-effort traffic.  Simple best-effort traffic and flow-rate
   fairness are in general not about optimality.

   This document does *not* address any issues about the implementation
   of flow-rate fairness.  In the current Internet, rough flow-rate
   fairness is achieved by the fact that *most* of the traffic in the
   Internet uses TCP, and *most* of the TCP connections in fact use
   conformant TCP congestion control [MAF05].  However, rough flow-rate
   fairness could also be achieved by the use of per-flow scheduling at
   congested routers [DKS89] [LLSZ96], by related router mechanisms
   [SSZ03], or by congestion-controlled transport protocols other than
   TCP.  None of those issues are addressed in this document.  In
   particular, this document does not address the pros and cons of TCP-
   friendly congestion control, equation-based congestion control
   [FHPW00], or any of the myriad of other issues concerning mechanisms
   for approximating flow-rate fairness.  Le Boudec's tutorial on rate
   adaption, congestion control, and fairness gives an introduction to
   some of these issues [B00].

   In a traffic class of simple best-effort traffic, it would be
   possible to have explicit fairness mechanisms that are implemented by
   the end-hosts in the network (as in proportional fairness or TCP-
   fairness), explicit fairness mechanisms enforced by the routers (as
   in max-min fairness with Fair Queueing), or a traffic class with no
   explicit fairness mechanisms at all (as in the Internet before TCP
   congestion control).

3.1.  The Usefulness of Flow-Rate Fairness

   Many of the useful aspects of best-effort traffic discussed above
   also quality as useful aspects of flow-rate fairness.

   Minimal technical demands on the network infrastructure:




Floyd                                                           [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


      First, the rough flow-rate fairness for best-effort traffic
      provided by TCP or other transport protocols makes minimal
      technical demands on the infrastructure (in the absence of
      policing, that is, as discussed further in the section below).
      The rough flow-rate fairness of TCP is provided by the transport
      protocol at the end-nodes, and doesn't require any mechanisms in
      routers or middleboxes.  However, mechanisms for enforcement of
      the flow-rate fairness *would* require some support from the
      infrastructure.

   Minimal demands in terms of economic infrastructure:

      Second, a system based on rough flow-rate fairness for best-effort
      traffic makes minimal demands in terms of economic relationships
      among ISPs or between users and ISPs.

   Usefulness in the real world:

      Third, the current system based on rough flow-rate fairness and
      best-effort traffic has shown its usefulness in the real world.
      In particular, the current Internet is largely based of the rough
      flow-rate fairness provided by TCP with best-effort traffic, and
      the Internet is still chugging along, however imperfectly.

   Getting a share of the available bandwidth:

      In addition, a system based on rough flow-rate fairness with best-
      effort traffic gives all users a reasonable chance of getting a
      share of the available bandwidth.  This seems to be a quality that
      is much appreciated by today's Internet users.


3.2.  The Limitations of Flow-Rate Fairness

   This section discusses some of the limitations of flow-rate fairness
   for simple best-effort traffic.  We would note that the limitations
   of flow-rate fairness are many, with a long history in the
   literature, while there is not much to be said about the benefits of
   flow-rate fairness.  This does *not* mean that flow-rate fairness is
   without benefit.  For simple best-effort traffic with rough flow-rate
   fairness, the quote from Winston Churchill about democracy comes to
   mind: "It has been said that democracy is the worst form of
   government except all the others that have been tried."

   One of the obvious limitations of flow-rate fairness is the
   difficulty of enforcement.  If an infrastructure is designed from the
   start with a requirement for ubiquitous per-flow scheduling, flow-
   rate fairness enforced by a scheduling mechanism in routers might be



Floyd                                                           [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   viable.  However, when starting with an infrastructure such as the
   current Internet with best-effort traffic largely served by FIFO
   (First-In First-Out) scheduling in routers and a design preference
   for intelligence at the ends, enforcement of flow-rate fairness is
   difficult at best.  Further, a transition to an infrastructure that
   provides actual flow-rate fairness for best-effort traffic enforced
   in routers would be difficult.

   A second possibility, which is largely how the current Internet is
   operated, would be best-effort traffic where most of the connections,
   packets, and bytes belong to connections using similar congestion-
   control mechanisms (in this case, those of TCP congestion control),
   with few if any enforcement mechanisms.  Of course, when this
   happens, the result is a rough approximation of flow-rate fairness,
   with no guarantees that the best-effort traffic will continue to be
   dominated by connections using similar congestion-control mechanisms
   or that users or applications cannot game the system for their
   benefit.  That is our current state of affairs.  The good news is
   that the current Internet continues to successfully carry traffic for
   many users.  In particular, we are not aware of reports of frequent
   congestion collapse, or of the Internet being dominated by severe
   congestion or intolerable unfairness.

   A third possibility would be best-effort traffic with flow-rate
   fairness provided by the congestion control mechanisms in the
   transport protocols, with some level of enforcement, either in
   congested routers, in middleboxes, or by other mechanisms.  [Add
   citations to some of the literature on this.]  There seems to us to
   be considerable promise that incentives among the various players
   (ISPs, vendors, customers, standards bodies, political entities,
   etc.) will align somewhat, and that further progress will be made on
   the deployment of various enforcement mechanisms for flow-rate
   fairness in best-effort traffic.  Of course, this is not likely to
   turn in to a fully-reliable and ubiquitous enforcement of flow-rate
   fairness, or of any related fairness goals, for best-effort traffic,
   so this is not likely to be satisfactory to purists in this area.

   The precise definition of flow-based fairness: A second limitation of
   flow-based fairness is that there is seemingly no consensus within
   the research, standards, or technical communities about the precise
   form of flow-based fairness that should be desired for best-effort
   traffic.  This area is very much still in flux, as applications,
   transport protocols, and the Internet infrastructure evolve.

   Some of the areas where there are range of opinions about the desired
   goals for rough flow-based fairness in best-effort traffic include
   the following:




Floyd                                                           [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   * Granularity: What is the appropriate granularity, for rough flow-
   based fairness [RFC2914]?  What controls should be embedded in end-
   to-end protocols about the number of connections opened by a single
   session?

   * RTT-fairness: What is the desired relationship between flow
   bandwidth and round-trip times, for best-effort traffic?  As shown in
   Section 3.3 of [FJ92], it would be straightforward to modify TCP's
   congestion control so that flows with similar packet drop rates but
   different round-trip times would receive roughly the same throughput.
   It remains an open question however (to this author, at any rate),
   what would be the desired relationship between throughput and round-
   trip times for best-effort traffic [HSMK98].

   * Multiple congested routers: What is the desired relationship
   between flow bandwidth and the number of congested routers along the
   path, for best-effort traffic?  It is well established that for TCP
   traffic in particular, flows that traverse multiple congested routers
   receive a higher packet drop rate, and therefore lower throughput,
   than flows with the same round-trip time that traverse only one
   congested router [F91].  There is also a long-standing debate between
   max-min fairness and proportional fairness, and no consensus within
   the research community on the desired fairness goals in this area.

   * Bursty vs. smooth traffic: What is the desired relationship between
   flow bandwidth and the burstiness in the sending rate of the flow?
   Is it a goal for a bursty flow to receive the same average bandwidth
   as a flow with a smooth sending rate?  The same maximum bandwidth?
   How does the goal depend on the time scale of the burstiness of the
   bursty flow [K96]?  (E.g., a flow that is bursty on time scales of
   less than a round-trip time has different dynamics than a flow that
   is bursty on a time scale of seconds or minutes.)  (Section 3.2 of
   [FJ92] shows that the use of Active Queue Management in routers can
   improve the bias against bursty traffic found in networks with Drop-
   Tail queues.)

   * Packets or bytes: Should the rough fairness goals be in terms of
   packets per second, or in bytes per second?

   * Unicast vs. multicast: What should the fairness goals be between
   unicast and multicast traffic?

   There is a range of literature for each of these topics, and we have
   not attempted to cite it all above.  Rough flow-based fairness for
   simple best-effort traffic could evolve with a range of possibilities
   for fairness in terms of round-trip times, the number of congested
   routers, packet size, or the number of receivers per flow.  (Further
   discussion can be found in [METRICS].)



Floyd                                                           [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   Fairness over time:

   One issue raised in [B07] concerns how fairness should be integrated
   over time.  For example, for simple best-effort traffic, should long
   flows receive less bandwidth in bits per second than short flows?
   For cost-based fairness or for QoS-based traffic, it seems perfectly
   viable for there to be some scenarios where the cost is a function of
   flow or session lifetime.  It also seems viable for there to be some
   scenarios where the cost of QoS-enabled traffic is independent of
   flow or session lifetime (e.g., for a private Intranet that is
   measured only by the bandwidth of the access link, but where any
   traffic sent of that Intranet is guaranteed to receive a certain
   QoS).

   However, for simple best-effort traffic, the current form of rough
   fairness that is not integrated over time seems perfectly acceptable.
   That is, in the current Internet, a user who opens a single TCP
   connection for ten hours *might* receive the same average throughput
   in bits per second, during that TCP connection, as a user who opens a
   single TCP connection for ten minutes and then goes off-line.
   Similarly, a user who is on-line for ten hours each day *might*
   receive the same throughput in bits per second, and pay roughly the
   same cost, as a user who is on-line for ten minutes each day.  That
   seems perfectly acceptable to us.  Other pricing mechanisms between
   users and ISPs seem acceptable also.

4.  On the Difficulties of Incremental Deployment

   One of the advantages of simple best-effort service is that it is
   here, today, in the current Internet, along with the rough flow-rate
   fairness that results from dominance of TCP's congestion control.

   While additional classes of service would clearly be of use in the
   Internet, the deployment difficulties have been non-trivial [B03].
   These difficulties in deploying interlocking changes to the
   infrastructure (as opposed to changes in applications) do not
   necessarily have an easy fix;  they stem in part from the underlying
   architecture of the Internet, which has its advantages as well as its
   disadvantages.  As explained in RFC 1958 on "Architectural Principles
   of the Internet": "Fortunately, nobody owns the Internet, there is no
   centralized control, and nobody can turn it off [RFC1958]."

   The difficulties of deployment for end-to-end intserv or diffserv
   mechanisms are well-known, having in part to do with the difficulties
   of deployment for the economic infrastructure that would be needed
   [B03].  It seems likely that cost-based pricing based on re-ECN could
   also have a difficult deployment path, involving the deployment of
   ECN-marking at routers, policers at both ends of a connection, and a



Floyd                                                          [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   complex set of economic relationships [B07].

   Papers on some of the difficulties of making changes in the Internet
   infrastructure, including the difficulties imposed by the political
   and economic context, include [CMB07].  The difficulty of making
   changes to the Internet infrastructure is in contrast to the
   comparative ease in making changes in Internet applications.

5.  Related Work

5.1.  From the IETF

   This section discusses IETF documents relating to best-effort service
   and flow-rate fairness.

   RFC 896 on congestion control: Nagle's RFC 896 on "Congestion Control
   in IP/TCP", from 1984, raises the issue of congestion collapse, and
   says that "improved handling of congestion is now mandatory"
   [RFC896].  RFC 896 was written in the context of a heavily-loaded
   network, the only private TCP/IP long-haul network in existence at
   the time (that of Ford Motor Company, in 1984).  In addition to
   introducing the Nagle algorithm for minimizing the transmission of
   small packets in TCP, RFC 896 considers the effectiveness of ICMP
   Source Quench for congestion control, and comments that future
   gateways should be capable of defending themselves against obnoxious
   or malicious hosts.  However, RFC 896 does not raise the question of
   fairness between competing users or flows.

   RFC 2914 on congestion control principles: RFC 2914, a Best Current
   Practice document from 2000 on "Congestion Control Principles",
   discusses the issues of preventing congestion collapse, maintaining
   some form of fairness for best-effort traffic, and optimizing a
   flow's performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss for the
   flow in question.  In the discussion of fairness, RFC 2914 outlines
   policy issues concerning the appropriate granularity of a "flow", and
   acknowledges that end nodes can easily open multiple concurrent flows
   to the same destination.  RFC 2914 also discusses open issues
   concerning fairness between reliable unicast, unreliable unicast,
   reliable multicast and unreliable multicast transport protocols.

   RFC 3714 on the amorphous problem of fairness: Section 3.3 of RFC
   3714, an Informational document from the IAB (Internet Architecture
   Board) discussing congestion control for best-effort voice traffic,
   has a discussion of "the amorphous problem of fairness", discussing

   complicating issues of packet sizes, round-trip times, application-
   level functionality, and the like [RFC3714].

   RFC 2616 on opening multiple connections: RFC 2616, the standards
   track document for HTTP/1.1, specifies that "clients that use
   persistent connections SHOULD limit the number of simultaneous
   connections that they maintain to a given server" [RFC2616] (Section
   8.1.4.).

   RFC 2309 on unresponsive flows: RFC 2309, an Informational document
   from the End-to-End Research Group on "Recommendations on Queue
   Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet" in 2000,
   contains the following recommendation: "It is urgent to begin or
   continue research, engineering, and measurement efforts contributing
   to the design of mechanisms to deal with flows that are unresponsive
   to congestion notification or are responsive but more aggressive than
   TCP." [RFC2309]

   RFCs on QoS: There is a long history in the IETF of the development
   of QoS mechanisms for integrated and differentiated services
   [RFC2212, RFC2475].


5.2.  From Elsewhere

   This section briefly mentions some of the many papers in the
   literature on best-effort traffic or on fairness for competing flows
   or users.  [B07] also has a section on some of the literature
   regarding fairness in the Internet.

   Fairness with AIMD: Fairness with AIMD (Additive Increase
   Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control was studied by Chiu and
   Jain in 1987, where fairness is maximized when each user or flow gets
   equal allocations of the bottleneck bandwidth [CJ89].  Van Jacobson's
   1988 paper on "Congestion Avoidance and Control" defined TCP's AIMD-
   based congestion control mechanisms.

   Fair Queueing: The 1989 paper of Fair Queueing by Demers et al.
   promoted Fair Queueing scheduling at routers as providing fair
   allocation of bandwidth, lower delay for low-bandwidth traffic, and
   protection from ill-behaved sources [DKS89].

   Congestion-based pricing: One of the early papers on congestion-based
   pricing in networks is the 1993 paper on "Pricing the Internet" by
   MacKie-Mason and Varian [MV93].  This paper proposed a "Smart Market"
   to price congestion in real time, with a per-packet-charge reflecting
   marginal congestion costs.  Frank Kelly's web page at [Proportional]
   has citations to papers on proportional fairness, including [K97] on



Floyd                                                          [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT         SIMPLE BEST EFFORT TRAFFIC              June 2007


   "Charging and Rate Control for Elastic Traffic".

   Other papers on pricing in computer networks include [SCEH96], which
   is in part a critique of some of the pricing proposals in the
   literature at the time.  [SCEH96] argues that usage charges must
   remain at significant levels even if congestion is extremely low.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not propose any new mechanisms for the Internet,
   and so does not require any security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
