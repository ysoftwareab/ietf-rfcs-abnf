Code  = Subnet Allocation option code (1 octet): 220
Len   = Length of the entire option including all sub-options
           (1 octet)
Flags = Various flags: (None currently defined)

Len   = Length of the suboption (always 2 for this suboption)
           (1 octet)
Flags = Flags field. (all unused bits must be zero)

       'h' = Hierarchical flag
             1 : Client will be allocating addresses from this subnet.
             0 : Client will be relaying DHCP requests to the Server
                 from this subnet.
       'i' = Information flag
             1 : Client is seeking information about previously
                 allocated subnets.
             0 : Client is seeking a new subnet allocation.

Prefix = Network prefix length requested
            (0 means no suggested length is given) (1 octet)

Len   = Length of the sub-option (min. length of 8) (1 octet)
Flags = Various flags which apply to ALL Subnet Prefix
           Information fields specified in this suboption.
           Unused flags must be zero.

       'c' : Client flag (explained below)
             1 : This information is in response to a client request
                 (or has been echoed back by the client, when asking
                 for the next previously allocated subnet from the
                 server)
             0 : Otherwise
       's' : Server flag (explained below)
             1 : Server has additional subnet information for this
                 client
             0 : Otherwise

Addr   = IPv4 network number (4 octets)
Prefix = Prefix length (1 octets)
Flags  = Flags field (Undefined bits must be zero) (1 octet)

       'd' = Deprecate flag (explained below)
             1 : Deprecation of this subnet is requested
             0 : No deprecation is needed

       'h' = Hierarchical flag (explained below)
             1 : Client will be allocating addresses from this subnet
             0 : Client will be relaying DHCP requests to the server
                 from this subnet.

Stat-len = Length of the optional statistics information field
              (zero if no statistics are included)

Len  = length of the sub-option (min. length of 1) (1 octet)

Len  = length of the sub-option (always 4 for this suboption) (1
      octet)
