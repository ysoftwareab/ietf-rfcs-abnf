Abstract

   This documents contains the policy-type definition for "std" within
   the Domain Policy DDDS Application.  Using this policy-type, service
   providers can announce to prospective callers which protocols (or
   protocol extensions) need to be supported to reach this destination
   network.

1.  Introduction

   The domain policy DDDS application [2] defines a generic method how a
   domain owner may announce the conditions to accept incoming
   communications.  This documents defines the policy-type for
   publishing a list of required standards (often protocol extensions)
   which a caller must support.

   The policy-type chosen for this application is "std".

   Rules using the the "std" policy-type refer to published and thus
   well-known rule-sets.  These are thus "Publications" in the language
   of [2].  Two parties can thus independently start to support and
   require a standard and will interoperate without any coordination.

   The examples in the Domain Policy DDDS I-D use this policy-type.


2.  Protocol Extensions

   Usually, protocols have built-in methods to signal support for
   extensions to the core protocol.  Such negotiations happen inside the
   protocol and thus only after the connection has been established.  If
   protocol extensions are not optional, but required by the receiving
   side, this can lead to the following unwanted effects:

   o  Delay: If the sender side can fall back to a different protocol or
      delivery path than such an unsuccessful connection attempt costs
      time.

   o  Layering problems: If the destination side requires special TLS or
      IPsec parameters for the connection to succeed, it cannot tell the
      sender side about these requirements within the protocol, as no
      connection can be established with having conveyed these
      parameters.

   o  Extension naming: Negotiations within the protocol usually use
      IANA-assigned protocol identifiers.  These might not be available
      for experimental extensions.

   The Domain Policy DDDS Application can be used to convey a list of
   required protocol extensions to any prospective sender out-of-band of
   the actual application protocol.


3.  Naming Protocol Extensions

   The Domain Policy DDDS Application uses URIs as identifiers for

Internet-Draft             Policy Publication                August 2006


   individual policy rules.  This is a good fit as URIs are perfect to
   indicate standards.

3.1.  RFCs

   According to RFC 2648 [1] IETF RFCs can be referenced by the URIs of
   the form "urn:ietf:rfc:<number>".

   As an example, a record of

      $ORIGIN example.com
      @ IN NAPTR 10 50   "U"  "D2P+SIP:std" (
                 "!^.*$!urn:ietf:rfc:3325!" . )

   indicates that example.com expects incoming calls to use the SIP
   Asserted Identity standard to transmit caller ID data.

3.2.  Internet Drafts

   RFC 2648 includes an URN definition for Internet Drafts as well.
   These look like "urn:ietf:id:<author-wg-name-version>".  RFC 2648
   lists "urn:ietf:id:ietf-urn-ietf-06" as an example.

3.3.  Other Standards

   As a general rule, if the publishing organization has defined an URN
   schema for its documents, that should be used.  If not, the location
   of the standard document on the official web-page can be used.


4.  Policy-Type template


      Policy Type: "std"

      URI Scheme(s): Any URI is allowed.

      Functional Specification: The URI acts as an identifier of
            a standardization document which describes procedures
            that a sender needs to follow.

      Security considerations: None beyond the ones listed in

   [2]
   .

      Intended usage: COMMON

5.  Examples

   The examples are for the SIP [4] peering case.  To build complex
   examples, the policy-type "fed" as described in [3] is also used.

   o  The carrier example.com only accepts SIP calls if a set of
      features is present, he might publish a policy like this:

      $ORIGIN example.com.
      ;      order pref flags service       regexp           replacement
       IN NAPTR 10 10   "U" "D2P+SIP:std" "!^.*$!urn:ietf:rfc:3325!" .
       IN NAPTR 10 11   "U" "D2P+SIP:std" "!^.*$!urn:ietf:rfc:3326!" .

   o  In this example the "example.com" also allows incoming connections
      as long they use the SIP remote party ID header.  Calls according
      to federation rules are preferred.

      $ORIGIN example.com.
       IN NAPTR 10 50 (                                 ; order priority
             "U" "D2P+SIP:fed"                          ; flags service
             "!^.*$!http://sipxconnect.example.org/!" . ; regexp repl
             )
       IN NAPTR 20 10 (                                 ; order priority
             "U" "D2P+SIP:std"                          ; flags service
             "!^.*$!urn:ietf:id:ietf-sip-privacy-02!" . ; regexp repl
             )


6.  Security Considerations

   The publishing of the access policy via the DNS RR described in this
   draft will reduce the amount of unwanted communication attempts, as
   all well-meaning clients will follow them, but these records cannot
   substitute measures to actually enforce the published policy.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the policy-type "std" for the domain policy
   DDDS application.
