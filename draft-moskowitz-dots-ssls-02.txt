1.  Introduction

   The DOTS requirements [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] includes

   o  Reduced fate-sharing

   o  Perform well during times of high congestion

   These requirements are at best challenging to meet with the
   traditional IETF communication building blocks of TCP+TLS or
   UDP+DTLS.  Recent work [I-D.hares-i2nsf-ssls] present a new/old way
   of isolating the DOTS protocol from the fate of the Internet
   Transport protocols by providing an OSI-styled Session Layer that
   provides:

   o  Data chunking

   o  Data compression

   o  Fully peered data security

   o  Survivablity of security state

   A session layer approach to DOTS would allow a single DOTS client/
   server communication to be selective on transport technology to the
   appropriate one for a given situation.  For example without requiring
   additional security management, a TCP connection can be used for
   large transfers during un-congested times.  Communications can switch
   to UDP during congestion caused by an on-going attack.  Even SMS (if

   directly supported by the DOTS agents) can be employed to get the
   message out during an attack.  All this with a single, manageable
   state between the DOTS client and agent.

   The intelligence to make the transport decision and the knowledge as
   to parameters like appropriate chunking size is managed in the
   session layer.

2.  Terms and Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Definitions

   DSRC:  (Dedicated Short Range Communications) is a two-way short- to-
      medium-range wireless communications capability that permits very
      high data transmission critical in communications-based automotive
      active safety applications.

3.  Problem Space

   The communication problems faced by DOTS are defined in the DOTS
   requirements [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements].  General requirements 2, 3
   and 4: Resiliance and Robustness, Bidirectionality, and Sub-MTU
   Message size, present challenges to current IETF communication tools.
   Only IPsec approaches a good fit to these requirements.

3.1.  The crypotgraphic state conundrum

   The cost for cryptography can come through frequent asymmetric key
   operations as in DKIM [RFC5585] and DSRC's IEEE 1609.2
   [IEEE.1609.2-2013] or maintaining communications security state as in
   TLS, DTLS, and IPsec.

   DKIM can afford asymmetric key operations as it works on a loose
   timing basis.  DSRC is requiring dedicated asymmetric key hardware in
   each car; the consumer will be absorbing those costs.  DOTS does not
   have the sub-second timing requirements like DSRC, nor does it have
   the minutes leeway of DKIM.  It is unlikely that the many DOTS
   clients will have the processing power for asymmetric key operations
   during a DDoS attack.  Thus DOTS should rely on one of the stateful
   secure communications technologies.

   Stateful secure communications implies some method of maintaining
   this state, especially during an active attack.  Both TLS and DTLS
   share fate with the underlying transport.  This means that if either
   the DOTS client or server is forced to reboot due to an attack (or
   any other reason), the D/TLS state needs to be reset.  For a DOTS
   client under attack, this can be a processor expensive operation and
   may fail out of hand if the downlink is flooded with attack traffic
   and the server response is lost.  The DOTS server has the additional
   conundrum as how to notify the client to reset the lost security
   state in a manner that does not introduce yet another attack.

3.1.1.  IPsec not a solution

   IKEv2 [RFC7296] can be started from either participant.  This means
   that a DOTS server can reset the security state as part of its reboot
   process.  ESP [RFC4303] in transport mode provides a familiar
   approach to protect UDP traffic.  ESP with IKEv2 fate-shares with
   both IP and UDP.  The loss of UDP state due to a DOTS server crash
   would require reestablishment of the security state.  This keeps
   attacks against the DOTS server as an important attack surface to
   weigh against the familiarity of ESP with IKEv2.

   ESP limits secure DOTS messaging to IP networks.  A different method
   would be needed for sending DOTS messages over SMS or require IP over
   a modem connection.

   ESP NAT traversal uses UDP and thus reintroduces the UDP blocking
   concern discussed above.

4.  Introducting a Session Layer Service

   The DOTS communication and security requirements can solved by moving
   above the transport and define an OSI-styled session layer.  A
   session-layer service would not fate-share with the underlying
   transport.  A peer-based KMP like IKEv2 or HIPv2 [RFC7401] can be
   initiated by either side, making recovery of security state straight-
   forward.  Further, if the security state is maintained in a secure
   store that can survive a system reboot, no reseting of the security
   state would be necessary after a reboot.  This would make an attack
   that causes a DOTS agent to reboot less interesting.

4.1.  Services provided at Session Layer

   Six key services are built into [I-D.hares-i2nsf-ssls]:

   o  KMP negotiation of compression and security

   o  Data chunking

   o  Data compression [GPComp]

   o  Fully peered data security [I-D.moskowitz-sse]

   o  Survivablity of security state [I-D.moskowitz-sse]

   o  Chuck fragmentation/Reassembly

5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations exist for this document at this time.

6.  Security Considerations

   A session layer security approach leaves the lower layers open to
   attack.  These attacks should not impact the DOTS application or
   session security.  At most they form yet another DoS attack against
   the DOTS agents.  This cost is considered acceptable balanced by the
   gains against other attacks if the security and other related
   services are moved back down the stack.
