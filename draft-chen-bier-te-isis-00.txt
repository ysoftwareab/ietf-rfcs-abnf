1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch] introduces Bit Index Explicit Replication
   (BIER) Traffic/Tree Engineering (BIER-TE).  It is an architecture for
   per-packet stateless explicit point to multipoint (P2MP) multicast
   path/tree.  A link in a BIER-TE domain has its BitPositions.  For a
   link between two nodes X and Y, there are two BitPositions for two
   forward connected adjacencies.  These two adjacency BitPositions
   could be configured on nodes X and Y respectively.  The BitPosition
   configured on X is the forward connected adjacency of Y.  The
   BitPosition configured on Y is the forward connected adjacency of X.

   This document proposes IS-IS extensions for distributing BitPositions
   configured on the links in "Bit Index Explicit Replication Traffic
   Engineering" (BIER-TE) domain.

1.1.  Terminology

   BIER: Bit Index Explicit Replication.

   BIER-TE:  BIER Traffic Engineering.

   BFR:  Bit-Forwarding Router.

   BFIR: Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router.

   BFER: Bit-Forwarding Egress Router.

   BFR-id:  BFR Identifier.  It is a number in the range [1,65535].

   BFR-NBR:  BFR Neighbor.

   IS-IS:  Intermediate System to Intermediate System.

2.  Extensions to IS-IS

   This section describes protocol extensions to IS-IS for distributing
   BIER-TE information such as the BitPositions configured on the links
   in a BIER-TE domain.

   An Extended IS Reachability TLV (Type 22) defined in [RFC5305] may
   contain Sub-TLVs (such as those for TE) that apply to a link/
   interface to a neighbor.  To encode multiple links or interfaces to
   neighbors, the structure inside TLV is repeated.

   MT Intermediate Systems TLV (Type 222) defined in [RFC5120] may
   contain Sub-TLVs (such as those for TE) that apply to a link/
   interface.  It is aligned with Extended IS Reachability TLV (Type 22)
   beside an additional two bytes in front at the beginning of the TLV
   for MT-ID.

   BIER-TE Info Sub-TLV of the following format is defined and used in
   Extended IS Reachability TLV (Type 22) and/or MT Intermediate Systems
   TLV (Type 222) to advertise the BIER-TE information about a link or
   interface.

                      Figure 1: BIER-TE Info Sub-TLV

   Type: TBD1 is to be assigned by IANA.

   Length:  Variable, dependent on Sub-Sub-TLVs.

   sub-domain-id:  Unique value identifying a BIER-TE sub-domain.

   BAR:  Single-octet BIER Algorithm used to calculate underlay paths to
         reach other BFRs.  Values are allocated from the "BIER
         Algorithm" registry defined in [RFC8401].

   IPA:  Single-octet IGP Algorithm used to either modify, enhance, or
         replace the calculation of underlay paths to reach other BFRs
         as defined by the BAR value.  Values are defined in the "IGP
         Algorithm Types" registry.

   BitPosition:  A 2-octet field encoding the BitPosition locally
         configured on the link/interface to an Intermediate System
         neighbor.

   DisEndBitPosition:  A 2-octet field encoding the BitPosition of the
         connection on the designated Intermediate Systems (Dis) end.
         This field is valid when the neighbor is a pseudonode.  If the
         neighbor is not a pseudonode, this field MUST be ignored.  The
         DisEndBitPosition may be configured on the link/interface to a
         transit network (i.e., broadcast link or say LAN).

   No Sub-Sub-TLV is defined so far.  Note that if each of BitPosition
   and DrEndBitPosition uses more than 2 octets, we use 4 or more octets
   for each of them.

3.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Under "Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 25, 141, 222, and 223" for IS-IS TLV
   Codepoints, IANA is requested to assign a new codepoint for BIER-TE
   Info Sub-TLV as follows:
