1. Introduction

1.1 The Spam Pandemic

   Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE), otherwise known as spam, has become as
   one of the most pressing issues on the Internet.  One oft-quoted
   study estimated that spam will cost businesses $13 billion in
   2003.[1] In April 2003, AOL reported that it had blocked 2.37 billion
   pieces of UBE in a single day. [2] And, in a sure sign that UBE has
   become of pressing concern, numerous politicians have begun to issue
   pronouncements and prescriptions for fighting this epidemic.[3][4]

   A variety of mechanisms from the technical community have been
   proposed and/or implemented to fight UBE:

   o  Whitelists are lists of known non-spammers.  For example, Habeas,
      Inc. maintains a Habeas User List (HUL) of people who have agreed
      to not spam.  By including a haiku in email headers and enforcing
      copyright on that ditty, they enforce their anti-spamming terms of
      service. [5]

   o  Blacklists are lists of known spammers or ISPs that allow spam.[6]

   o  Spam filters run client-side or server-side to filter out spam
      based on whitelists, blacklists, and textual and header
      analysis.[7]

   o  A large number of documents address the overall technical
      considerations for the control of UBE [8], operational
      considerations for SMTP agents[9], and various extensions to the
      protocols to support UBE identification and filtering.
      [10][11][12]

   o  Various proposals have been advanced for "do not spam" lists, akin
      to the Federal Trade Commission's "Do Not Call" list for
      telemarketers.[13]


1.2 No Soliciting in the Real World

   Municipalities frequently require solicitors to register with the
   town government.  And, in many cases, the municipalities prohibit
   soliciting in residences where the occupant has posted a sign.  The
   town of West Newbury, Massachusetts, for example, requires:

      "It shall be unlawful for any canvasser or solicitor to enter the
      premises of a resident or business who has displayed a 'No
      Trespassing' or 'No Soliciting' sign or poster.  Further, it shall

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


      be unlawful for canvassers or solicitors to ignore a resident or
      business person's no solicitation directive or remain on private
      property after its owner has indicated that the canvasser or
      solicitor is not welcome." [14]

   Registration requirements for solicitors, particularly those
   soliciting for political or religious reasons, have been the subject
   of a long string of court cases.  However, the courts have generally
   recognized that individuals may post "No Soliciting" signs and the
   government may enforce the citizen's desire. In a recent case where
   Jehovah's Witnesses challenged a registration requirement in the city
   of Stratton, Connecticut, saying they derived their authority from
   the Scriptures, not the city.  However, the court noted:

      "A section of the ordinance that petitioners do not challenge
      establishes a procedure by which a resident may prohibit
      solicitation even by holders of permits. If the resident files a
      'No Solicitation Registration Form' with the mayor, and also posts
      a 'No Solicitation' sign on his property, no uninvited canvassers
      may enter his property ..." [15]

   Even government, which has a duty to promote free expression, may
   restrict the use of soliciting on government property. In one case,
   for example, a school district was allowed to give access to its
   internal electronic mail system to the union that was representing
   teachers, but was not required to do so to a rival union that was
   attempting to gain the right to represent the teachers.  The court
   held that where property is not a traditional public forum "and the
   Government has not dedicated its property to First Amendment
   activity, such regulation is examined only for reasonableness."[16]

   The courts have consistently held that the state has a compelling
   public safety reason for regulating solicitation.  In Cantwell v.
   Connecticut, the Supreme Court held that "a State may protect its
   citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the
   community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any
   purpose, to establish his identity and his authority to act for the
   cause which he purports to represent."[17] And, in Martin v. City of
   Struthers, the court noted that "burglars frequently pose as
   canvassers, either in order that they may have a pretense to discover
   whether a house is empty and hence ripe for burglary, or for the
   purpose of spying out the premises in order that they may return
   later."[18] The public safety issue applies very much to email, where
   viruses can easily be delivered, in contrast to telephone
   solicitations where public safety is not nearly as much an issue.

   This analysis is very U.S.-centric, which may be appropriate given
   that the large majority of UBE appears to originate from U.S.

   citizens.  However, the concept of prohibiting unwanted solicitation
   does carry over to other countries:

   o  In Hong Kong, offices frequently post "no soliciting" signs.

   o  In the United Kingdom, where door-to-door peddlers are fairly
      common, "no soliciting" signs are also common.

   o  In Australia, where door-to-door does not appear to be a pressing
      social problem, there was legislation passed which outlawed the
      practice of placing ads under wipers of parked cars.

   o  In France, which has a long tradition of door-to-door
      solicitation, apartment buildings often use trespass laws to
      enforce "no solicitation" policies.

   o  In the Netherlands, where door-to-door solicitation is not a
      pressing issue, there is a practice of depositing free
      publications in mailboxes.  The postal equivalent of "no spam"
      signs are quite prevalent and serve notice that the publications
      are not desired.


1.3 A Distributed No Soliciting Extension

   Many of the anti-spam proposals that have been advanced have great
   merit, however none of them give notice to an SMTP agent in the
   process of delivering mail that the receiver does not wish to receive
   solicitations. Such a virtual sign would serve two purposes:

   o  It would allow the receiving system to "serve notice" that a
      certain class of electronic mail is not desired, whether or not
      such a message is properly identified as belonging to that class.

   o  If a message is properly identified as belonging to a certain
      class and that class of messages is not desired, transfer of the
      message can be eliminated.  Rather than filtering after delivery,
      elimination of the message transfer can save network bandwidth,
      disk space, and processing power.

   This memo details a series of extensions to SMTP that have the
   following characteristics:

   o  A service extension is described that allows a receiving MTA to
      signal the sending MTA that no soliciting is in effect.

   o  A header field for the sender of the message is defined that
      allows the sender to flag a message as conforming to a certain

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


      class.

   o  Trace fields for intermediate MTAs are extended to allow the
      intermediate MTA to signal that a message conforms to a certain
      class.

   Allowing the sender of a message to tag a message as being, for
   example, unsolicited commercial email with adult content, allows
   "good" spammers to conform to legal content labelling requirements by
   governmental authorities or conventions imposed by "whitelist"
   services.  For senders of mail who choose not to abide by these
   conventions, the intermediate trace fields defined here allow the
   destination MTA or a designated intermediate MTA to perform
   appropriate dispositions on the received message.

   This distributed approach to controlling UBE is advanced as an
   alternative to centralized "do-not-spam" lists.  The concluding
   section of this document details how the decentralized approach would
   work in practice and contrasts this approach to a centralized list.

2. The No-Soliciting SMTP Service Extension

   Per RFC 2821,[22] a "NO-SOLICITING" SMTP service extension is
   defined. The service extension is declared during the initial "EHLO"
   SMTP exchange.  The extension has one optional parameter and zero or
   more solicitation class keywords.  Using the notation as described in
   the Augmented BNF[23], the syntax is:

     No-Soliciting-Service = "NO-SOLICITING"
       [ "SYSTEM-WIDE" / "PER-RECIPIENT" ]
       0*( Solicitation-keywords )


2.1 The SYSTEM-WIDE Option

   "NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE" indicates that no soliciting is in effect
   for all messages delivered to this system.  It is equivalent to the
   sign on the door of an office building announcing a company-wide
   policy.

   The parameter is presented during the initial exchange between sender
   and receiver:

     R: <wait for connection on TCP port 25>
     S: <open connection to server>
     R: 220 trusted.example.com SMTP service ready
     S: EHLO untrusted.example.com
     R: 250-trusted.example.com says hello
     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE ADV

   (The "ADV" keyword is one of several possible values and is described
   in the following section.)

   A similar proposal was advanced in 1999 by John Levine and Paul
   Hoffman.  This proposal used the SMTP greeting banner to specify that
   unsolicited bulk email is prohibited on a particular system through
   the use of the "NO UCE" keyword.[19]  As the authors note, their
   proposal has the potential of overloading the semantics of the
   greeting banner, which may also be used for other purposes (see,
   e.g., [20]).

2.2 Solicitation Class Keywords

   The "NO-SOLICITING" service extension may use solicitation class
   keywords that signify a specific class of solicitations that are not
   accepted.  Keywords are separated by commas and follow the
   "SYSTEM-WIDE" parameter.

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


   Three classes are defined in this draft:

   Keywords  Description                       Reference
   --------- --------------------------------  ---------
   MAPS-UBE  Unsolicited Bulk Email            http://mail-abuse.org/
   ADV       Unsolicited Commercial Email      http://www.spamlaws.com/
   ADV:ADLT  Sexually Explicit Commercial Mail http://www.spamlaws.com/

   MAPS-UBE is the standard advanced by the Mail Abuse Prevention System
   (MAPS), which states:

      An electronic message is "spam" IF: (1) the recipient's personal
      identity and context are irrelevant because the message is equally
      applicable to many other potential recipients; AND (2) the
      recipient has not verifiably granted deliberate, explicit, and
      still-revocable permission for it to be sent; AND (3) the
      transmission and reception of the message appears to the recipient
      to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.

   Numerous states have adopted the "ADV" and "ADV:ADLT" conventions.
   We cite the spamlaws.com site as a reference because it provides an
   excellent summary of the definitions and pointers to the relevant
   statutes.

   There is no default keyword for the service.  In other words, the
   following example is a "no-op":

     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE

   Additional solicitation class keywords may be defined and registered
   in the registry as specified in Section 5. Multiple solicitation
   class keywords are separated by a comma to form a list:

     Solicitation-keywords = 1Solicit-word 0*("," 1Solicit-word)
     Solicit-word = [ "MAPS-UBE" / "ADV" / "ADV:ADLT"
                      / x-word / registered-word ]
     x-word = ["x-" / "X-"] 1*(wordchars)

     registered-word = ALPHA 0*(wordchars)
                                  ; registered-word(s) are registered
                                  ; with the IANA
     wordchars = 1*("-" / "_" / ":" / ALPHA / DIGIT)


2.3 The PER-RECIPIENT Option

   The "NO-SOLICITING PER-RECIPIENT" extension specifies that each "MAIL
   FROM" command must identify if a message is a solicitation.



Malamud                   Expires May 29, 2004                  [Page 8]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


   The presence of this extension is identified during the initial
   greeting:

     R: <wait for connection on TCP port 25>
     S: <open connection to server>
     R: 220 trusted.example.com SMTP service ready
     S: EHLO untrusted.example.com
     R: 250-trusted.example.com says hello
     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING PER-RECIPIENT

   Additionally, "SOLICIT" is defined as a parameter for the "MAIL FROM"
   command.  The "SOLICIT" parameter is followed by an optional equal
   sign and a comma separated list of solicitation class keywords.

   The syntax for this parameter is:

     Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter = "SOLICIT"
                            1( "=" Solicitation-keywords)

   As an informational message, the "550" or "250" replies to the "RCPT
   TO" command may also contain the "SOLICIT" parameter.

   The receiving system may decide on a per-user basis the appropriate
   disposition of messages:

     S: MAIL FROM:<savebigbucks@hotmail.com> SOLICIT=ADV,MAPS-UBE
     S: RCPT TO:<coupon_clipper@trusted.resource.org>
     R: 250 <coupon_clipper@trusted.resource.org>... Recipient ok
     S: RCPT TO:<grumpy_old_boy@trusted.resource.org>
     R: 550 <grumpy_old_boy@trusted.resource.org>... SOLICIT=ADV

   In the previous example, the receiving MTA returned a "550" status
   code, indicating that the message was being rejected.  Note that the
   implementation also echoes back the currently set keywords for that
   user as a rudimentary informational message.

2.4 Use of Enhanced Mail Status Codes

   If a session between two MTAs is using both the "NO-SOLICITING"
   extension and the Enhanced Mail Status Codes as defined in RFC
   3463[25] and a message is rejected based on the presence of a
   "SOLICIT" parameter, the correct error message to return is "5.7.1",
   defined as "the sender is not authorized to send to the destination
   ... [because] of per-host or per-recipient filtering."

2.5 Solicitation Mail Header

   Per RFC 2822,[24] a new "Solicitation:" header field is defined which



Malamud                   Expires May 29, 2004                  [Page 9]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


   contains one or more solicitation class keywords.

     To: Coupon Clipper <coupon_clipper@trusted.resource.org>
     From: Spam King <savebigbucks@hotmail.com>
     Solicitation: ADV,ADV:ADLT

   Several proposals, particularly legal ones, have suggested requiring
   the use of keywords in the "Subject:" header. While embedding
   information in the "Subject:" header may provide visual cues to end
   users, it does not provide a straightforward set of cues for computer
   programs such as mail transfer agents. As with embedding a "no
   solicitation" message in a greeting banner, this would overload the
   semantics of the "Subject:" header.  Of course, there is no reason
   why both mechanisms can't be used, and in any case the
   "Solicitation:" header could be automatically inserted based on the
   contents of the subject line.

   It should be noted that the presence of both a "Solicitation:" header
   and a "SOLICIT" service extension leads to the possibility of
   conflict between the two. Implementors *SHOULD* always include any
   values found in the "Solicitation:" header in the fields presented in
   the service extension.  Implementors "MAY" add additional keywords
   for operational reasons as defined in Section 7.7 of RFC 2821[22].

2.6 Insertion of Solicitation Keywords in Trace Fields

   The "Solicitation:" mail header is only available to the sending
   client.  RFCs 2821 and 2822 are quite specific that intermediate MTAs
   shall not change message headers, with the sole exception of the
   "Received:" trace field.  Since many current systems use an
   intermediate relay to detect unsolicited mail, an addition to the
   "Received:" header is described.

   As a review, RFC 2821[22] documents the following productions for the
   "Received:" header in a mail message:

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


     Time-stamp-line = "Received:" FWS Stamp <CRLF>

     Stamp = From-domain By-domain Opt-info ";"  FWS date-time
        ; where "date-time" is as defined in [32]
        ; but the "obs-" forms, especially two-digit
        ; years, are prohibited in SMTP and MUST NOT be used.

     Opt-info = [Via] [With] [ID] [For]

     With = "WITH" FWS Protocol CFWS

     Protocol = "ESMTP" / "SMTP" / Attdl-Protocol

     Attdl-Protocol = Atom
        ; Additional standard names for protocols are registered with
        ; the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  SMTP servers
        ; SHOULD NOT use unregistered names.

   The appropriate location for solicitation information is the
   "Attdl-Protocol" field, which is defined in this document as
   "ESMTP-Solicitation".  The RFC 2821 productions are supplemented as
   follows:

     Protocol = "ESMTP" / "SMTP" / ESMTP-Solicitation / Attdl-Protocol
     ESMTP-Solicitation =  "ESMTP-Solicitation"
                           FWS 0*( Solicitation-keywords )

   An example of a Received: header from a conforming MTA is as follows:

     Received: by foo-mta.example.com with
        ESMTP-Solicitation ADV,ADV:ADLT ; Sat, 9 Aug 2003
        16:54:42 -0700 (PDT)


2.7 Relay of Messages

   The "NO-SOLICITING SYSTEM-WIDE" service extension, if present,
   applies to all messages handled by the receiving Message Transfer
   Agent (MTA), including those messages intended to be relayed to
   another system.

   When relaying a message which was received via the SMTP protocol in
   which the "SOLICIT" parameter was set on the "MAIL FROM" command, the
   MTA *MUST* also set the "SOLICIT" parameter when delivering the
   message to an SMTP server that supports this extension.

   The "SOLICIT" parameter on a "MAIL FROM" command can be derived from
   a variety of sources, including receipt of a message from a

   as defined in Section 7.7 of RFC 2821[22], set this parameter after
   detecting the presence of the "Solicitation:" or extended "Received:"
   message header field or by using other system-specific techniques.

   Implementers should be aware that the "NO-SOLICITING" service
   extension is not a guaranteed end-to-end service.  Specifically,
   intermediate relays that do not support this service may "lose" the
   per-message parameters. However, any trace fields inserted during the
   message transfer process will persist.

2.8 Recommendations for Developers and Administrators

   It is strongly recommended that any developers that implement the
   "NO-SOLICITING" service extension *SHOULD NOT* enable the service as
   a default.  There are some indications that some policy makers may
   view a default filtering in software as a prior restraint on
   commercial speech. In other words, because the person installing the
   software did not make an explicit choice to enable a certain type of
   filtering, some might argue that such filtering was not desired.

   Likewise, it is recommended that a system administrator installing
   software *SHOULD NOT* enable "PER-RECIPIENT" filtering by default for
   a user.  Again, individual users should request the service.

   The mechanism for an individual user to communicate their desire to
   enable certain types of filtering is outside the scope of this
   document.

   It should be noted that for recipient MTAs, implementation of the
   "SYSTEM-WIDE" option is significantly simpler than adding
   "PER-RECIPIENT" capabilities.  Because "PER-RECIPIENT" is an optional
   parameter, it should be noted that:

   o  A conforming sending MTA *MUST* provide support for both
      "SYSTEM-WIDE" and "PER-RECIPIENT".

   o  A conforming receiving MTA *MAY* provide support for either
      "SYSTEM-WIDE" or "PER-RECIPIENT" or both.

   Implementation of the SYSTEM-WIDE on a receiving MTA is almost
   trivial.  For example, on the popular sendmail [27] package, a few
   minor changes need to be made to three files.

3. Use of the Extension

   This proposal is not meant to solve the UBE problem, but offers some
   tools that can be used by policy makers, be they governments defining
   laws or Internet Service Providers defining appropriate use policies.
   It does not solve the issues addressed by proposals that, for
   example, add "reverse MX" resource records to the Domain Name System.
   However, the service extension does allow a mail recipient to notify
   the sender that certain forms of electronic mail are not desired and
   does give policy makers a mechanism for requiring senders of such
   electronic mail to identify their missives and allows them to
   establish penalties for failure to do so.

   By providing a service-level extension to SMTP, this proposal
   provides a simple mechanism that allows a system or ISP to put email
   senders on notice that mail that is both bulk and unsolicited is not
   wanted.  To illustrate how the system might work in practice, a
   simple hypothetical scenario is presented.

   Our scenario posits that the U.S. federal government wants to do
   something about spam, but is uncertain about the effectiveness of a
   centralized "do not spam" list.  Instead, they decide to go for a
   more decentralized approach as follows:

   1.  The first step would be for the government to promulgate a
       definition of spam and tie a keyword to that definition.  This
       definition needs to published in a permanent record of some sort
       so that it can be referenced in the following steps.  The
       Congressional Record [28] or the Federal Register [29] would both
       be considered adequate for this purpose.  The definition needs to
       include an unambiguous definition of mail covered by the keyword,
       a mechanism for a sender to convey that information, and the
       legal import of the "NO-SOLICITING" notice and any penalties for
       violation thereof.  Let us suppose that the keyword to be
       registered is ""UCE".

   2.  The appropriate authority (e.g., the Clerk of the House [30] or
       an appropriate executive branch official) would register this
       definition with the IANA using the template as described in
       Section 5 and sending the completed template to iana@iana.org
       [31].

   3.  To the extent that a proliferation of keywords and conflicting
       definitions is considered an issue by policy makers, appropriate
       discussions would be held with other countries and the states to
       make definitions consistent.

   4.  Reputable email list maintainers would activate a simple check of

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


       each address on their lists by connecting to the SMTP port of at
       least one system indicated by an MX record in the Domain Name
       System.  If either the "SYSTEM-WIDE" or "PER-RECIPIENT" service
       extension matches the "UCE" keyword, the address would be
       scrubbed from the list.

   5.  Reputable users of email lists would add a "Solicitation: UCE"
       header to their electronic mail and activate the same simple
       check described in the previous step.  Any addresses matching the
       check would trigger non-delivery of the message and, presumably,
       the scrubbing of that address from the list.

   6.  A system manager, under the guidance of the Administrative
       Contact for a domain, would configure "MX" records in the Domain
       Name System to designate one or more systems authorized to
       receive mail for the domain in question.  For each system so
       designated, the system manager might enable "NO-SOLICITING
       SYSTEM-WIDE UCE". These systems receiving mail on behalf of the
       designated domain might also be configured to run a spam
       identification utility, such as SpamAssasin [32] or SpamBouncer
       [33].

   7.  End users would configure their mail filters to filter out any
       properly tagged messages (e.g., "Solicitation: UCE") and any
       messages that are not properly tagged (e.g., in SpamBouncer, the
       user might set the "SPAMLEVEL" parameter to "10", which would
       filter all messages with a score of 10 or greater using the
       software's own algorithms for the detection of probable spam).

   8.  Unagressive end users would simply delete their spam folder
       periodically.  More paranoid end users would check the folder for
       false positives and then delete it.  A few users might take more
       agressive steps.  For example, setting the SpamBouncer
       "SPAMREPLY" to "COMPLAIN" will automatically dispatch complaints
       to ISP abuse lines. If financial penalties for violation of UCE
       tagging provisions exist and include a split between the federal
       authorities and the filer of a complaint, an additional copy of
       the offending mail can be dispatched to a service bureau whose
       function is to aggregate large amounts of spam, find the senders,
       and then file appropriate procedural motions, receiving a portion
       of any recovered monies in return for its efforts.


3.1 Relationship to Centralized Approaches

   The overwhelming success of the "do not call" list for telemarketing
   provisions have prompted a variety of proposals for similar "do not
   spam" lists.  Such a list takes a centralized approach to solving the



Malamud                   Expires May 29, 2004                 [Page 14]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


   same problem addressed by this service extension.  The centralized
   approach has the following potential pitfalls:

   o  From the point of view of the consumer, a centralized list
      operates in batch mode: there is a lag between asserting the
      desire to start or stop receiving a certain type of mail and the
      implementation of that assertion.  Consumers will still need to
      filter mail and decide if they want to take action upon violations
      of either centrally-administered or distributed solutions.

   o  From the point of view of the government, a centralized list
      requires a bureaucracy to administer and maintain the list.
      Because the list contains aggregated information, it is more
      valuable to legally irresponsible mailers and thus adequate
      security provisions need to be made for the list contents.

   o  The decentralized approach is cheaper for telemarketers to
      implement. From the point of view of the sender of unsolicited
      mail, the bulk approach requires a significant data processing
      investment to "scrub" lists that are received.  This is a classic
      database cartesian product.  Assume a do-not-spam list with 1
      million names and a sender's list with 1 million name.  If one
      were to use all the methods, procedures, and systems specified in
      various federal data processing regulations, this computational
      program could easily consume 1 googleflop of processing power
      (although it should be recognized that processing the do-not-spam
      list into a structure such as hash can reduce the number of
      lookups closer to the theoretical minimum of 1 million data
      accesses).  In contrast, the decentralized approach requires a
      simple pattern match on one address at a time.

   It should be noted that the centralized and decentralized approaches
   can coexist in some manner.  A useful analogy is the field of
   copyright.  Documents have an inherent copyright and the legal
   definition of a copyright violation takes into account the degree to
   which the alleged violator knew they were violating the conditions
   imposed by the law.  One common way to assert coypright is through a
   mark on the document itself, a decentralized approach to copyright
   assertion.  One can also file a registration with the copyright
   office, which adds an additional presumption that adequate notice has
   been given.

   In the example of spam prevention, there would also be an inherent
   right, the right not to received unsolicited commercial mail.  The
   courts or executive branch, as with copyright, would assess fines
   based on a variety of factors, and the degree of notice could
   certainly be such a factor.  Adding an address to a registry of
   do-not-spam addresses, in conjunction with a real-time

   "NO-SOLICITING" assertion could both be factors taken into
   consideration in levying fines or taking other corrective actions.

4. Security Considerations

   This proposal does not present additional security complications
   beyond those already amply represented in the current architecture
   for electronic mail.

5. IANA Considerations

   There are four IANA considerations presented in this draft:

   1.  Addition of the "NO-SOLICITING" service extension to the Mail
       Parameters registry.

   2.  Addition of the "ESMTP-Solicitation" Additional Protocol

   3.  Creation of a Solicitation Class Keywords registry.

   4.  Creation of a "Solicitation:" mail header, which does not
       currently raise any IANA considerations.


5.1 The Mail Parameters Registry

   The IANA Mail Parameters registry documents SMTP service extensions.
   The "NO-SOLICITATION" service extension would need to be added to
   this registry as follows.

     Keywords        Description                       Reference
     ------------    --------------------------------  ---------
     NO-SOLICITING   Notification of no soliciting.    [<this draft>]

   The parameters subregistry would need to be modified as follows:

     Service Ext      EHLO Keyword   Parameters       Reference
     -----------      ------------   -----------      ---------
     No Soliciting    NO-SOLICITING  SYSTEM-WIDE      [<this draft>]
     No Soliciting    NO-SOLICITING  PER-RECIPIENT    [<this draft>]


5.2 ESMTP-Solicitation Additional Protocol

   The Mail Parameters registry would need to be modified to list
   "ESMTP-Solicitation" as a valid additional protocol for use in the
   "Received:" header of a mail message.

5.3 The Solicitation Class Keywords Registry

   A new registry (or a subregistry of Mail Parameters) would need to be
   established for Solicitation Class Keywords.  The registry would
   contain the following fields:

   1.  Keyword name (e.g., "MAPS-UBE").

   2.  Keyword description (e.g., "Unsolicited Bulk Email").

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  November 2003


   3.  Keyword reference (e.g., "<this draft>").

   Per the policies outlined in RFC 2434[26], it is recommended that the
   IESG appoint a Designated Expert to administer this registry.
   Authority for solicitation class keywords in this registry will come
   in some cases from published RFCs, but in other cases will come from
   applicable laws or regulations.  It is recommended that any non-RFC
   derived solicitation class keywords be documented in future
   informational RFCs to provide a consistent set of references.

5.4 The Solicitation Mail Header

   There is currently no registry defined for mail headers.  If such a
   registry were to exist, the "Solicitation:" header field would need
   to be added to it.

      "SYSTEM-WIDE-NO-SOLICITING" and "PER-MESSAGE-NO-SOLICITING") have
      been collapsed into a single "NO-SOLICITING" service extension (
      See Section 2).

      included (see Section 2.4).

   o  A more extensive IANA Considerations section has been added,
      including creation of a Solicitation Keywords registry (see
      Section 5).

Appendix B. Transmittal

   November 30, 2003

   The Honorable Timothy J. Muris, Chairman
   The Federal Trade Commission
   600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
   Washington, D.C. 20580
   remote-printer.Timothy_J_Muris/FTC@12023262012.iddd.tpc.int [41]

   Dear Mr. Muris:

   On October 23, 2003, the U.S. Senate passed S.877, known as the
   CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. [42]  That bill provides, in part:

      *SEC. 109. DO-NOT-EMAIL REGISTRY.*

      (a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 6 months after the date of
      enactment of this title, the Commission shall transmit to the
      Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the
      House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce a report
      that--

      1.  sets forth a plan and timetable for establishing a nationwide
          marketing Do-Not-E-mail registry;

      2.  includes an explanation of any practical, technical, security,
          privacy, enforceability, or other concerns that the Commission
          has regarding such a registry; and

      3.  includes an explanation of how the registry would be applied
          with respect to children with e-mail accounts.

   I have read with some interest comments by you and Mr. Beales in the
   press regarding the practicality of implementing a centralized
   "do-not-spam" list. I share your feelings that a centralized
   do-not-call list makes sense and certainly has been popular, but that
   email has vastly different characteristics from telephone numbers,
   making such a list impractical.

   I hope that in your deliberations on this subject and in your report
   to the Congress you will consider decentralized approaches to this
   problem, such as the one detailed in the proposed SMTP extension
   described here:

      http://trusted.resource.org/no-solicit/

   I should note that the above-referenced proposal is not the only way

   to accomplish the goal of non-centralized non-solicitation
   notification, and is brought to your attention simply to demonstrate
   that non-centralized approaches to this important problem are
   possible and practical.

   Please don't hesitate to let me know if you would like more
   information or if I can answer any questions.

   Sincerely yours,
