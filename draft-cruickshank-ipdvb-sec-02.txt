    Internet-Draft         Security Extension for ULE      June 2006 
        

    1. Introduction 

       The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation Protocol (ULE) [3] 
       is used for the transportation of user traffic like IP datagrams, 
       ethernet frames, etc. over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS) [1]. 
       This document describes a new ULE Mandatory extension header for 
       providing link layer security for ULE. 

       In MPEG-2 transmission networks employing ULE, there is a need to 
       provide link-layer security, particularly where network layer and 
       transport-layer security may not be sufficient. The security 
       requirements are presented and discussed in detail in draft-
       cruickshank-ipdvb-sec-req-02. The set of security services that 
       the security extension for ULE can provide includes data 
       confidentiality, data integrity, data origin authentication and 
       rejection of replayed packets. The focus is on providing suitable 
       link encryption.  However, link layer data integrity and data 
       origin authentication is provided as an optional security 
       service, especially for systems where there are several ULE 
       transmitters (e.g. satellite meshed systems with On-Board 
       Processing). 

       On Securing the ULE SNDUs, security is provided at the link layer 
       as opposed to other existing mechanisms like IP Security (IPsec) 
       [7] that provides security at the network-layer or TLS [10] that 
       provides transport layer security. Since these security services 
       are provided at the link layer any network layer protocol like IP 
       (even with Ethernet bridging) may be used with Secure ULE. 

       ULE may use and benefit from IETF key management protocols, such 
       as the MSEC GDOI [8] and GSAKMP [6]. This does not preclude the 
       use of other key management methods in scenarios which benefit 
       from this. The encryption algorithms, key lengths, etc. will be 
       defined making use of the standard IPsec suites.  For this 
       purpose a security association identity similar to the IPsec SPI 
       [7] is used. 

       In some current encapsulation methods like MPE [4], encryption of 
       the MAC address requires each Receiver to decrypt all encrypted 
       data sent using a TS Logical Channel (identified by a PID), 
       before it can then filter the PDUs that matches the set of 
       Network Point of Attachment (NPA) addresses that the Receiver 
       wishes to receive.  Therefore encryption of the MPE NPA address 
       is not permitted in such systems.  This document specifies a 
       method which provides support for using temporary Layer 2 NPA 
       address.

    2. ULE Security Extension 

       This section describes the security services offered and the 
       packet format of the security extension for ULE.  The procedures 
       for processing the security extension header at the transmitter 
       and the receiver are also described.

    2.1. Security Services 

       MPEG-2 based networks are susceptible to several security 
       attacks, both passive and active. Some of the main security 
       services (mandatory or optional) that the security extension for 
       ULE aims to provide for IP services running on MPEG-2 based 
       systems are: 

       o Data Confidentiality (Mandatory): Data confidentiality is 
          achieved by encrypting the higher layer PDU before 
          encapsulation in the ULE SNDU, so that only authorised 
          receivers can decrypt the transmitted information while an 
          adversary would not be able to recover the important 
          information even if it got hold of the transmitted data. 

       o Receiver NPA address hiding (mandatory): This is an important 
          objective for ULE security to prevent any passive attacks like 
          traffic analysis.  Using option D=1 (no NPA address) is OK as 
          long as the ULE_Security_IDentifier (ULE-SID) is unique in the 
          whole ULE network.  This implies the need for a centralised 
          key management system that generates the ULE-SID. If NPA 
          address is used (option D=0) in the base ULE header, then the 
          Network Control Centre (NCC) is responsible for generating a 
          temporary NPA address. The temporary NPA address should be 
          used for all secure communications with that Receiver. The ULE 
          encapsulator should be notified of these addresses as well. In 
          addition, the temporary NPA address will change from time to 
          time depending on the security policy and it is not directly 
          related to each ULE session. It can change periodically (for 
          example after a specified period of time and/or after a 
          specified volume of traffic has been sent to that terminal).  
          The temporary NPA address is used in association with the ULE-
          SID for specific session security. It is envisaged that there 
          will be a small impact on the NCC for handling two NPA 
          addresses for each terminal. 

       o Data origin authentication (Optional): Data origin (source) 
          authentication allows a receiver to verify that the data is 
          sent by the claimed sender. To achieve data origin 
          authentication, a Message Authentication Code (MAC) is 
          generated for each message using a shared secret key and is 
          also transmitted along with the data.  The ULE receiver would 
          also calculate the MAC for the received data using the shared 
          key, and then compare this computed MAC value to the one sent 
          by the sender along with the data. If the two matches, then 
          the receiver knows that the data had to be sent from the 
          claimed sender.

    Internet-Draft         Security Extension for ULE      June 2006 
        

       o Data Integrity (Optional): Data integrity provides a way for 
          the receiver of the data message to know if the data has been 
          tampered in transit by an attacker. The MAC used for data 
          authentication also provides data integrity. The receiver of 
          the data calculates the MAC and compares it to the one 
          transmitted by the sender. If an adversary had tampered with 
          the message then the two MACs would not match. 

       o Replay Attacks Countermeasures (Optional): Methods against 
          replay attacks need to ensure that the received data is recent 
          and that an adversary has not replayed old messages at a later 
          time. A monotonically increasing sequence number would be used 
          with every message and messages with old sequence number 
          values would be rejected. The choice of using sequence numbers 
          is dictated by policy and is done by the key management 
          system. 

       Another issue is key space, which means security key storage and 
       the related key databases. There is a need for the following two 
       databases for the correct processing on security in ULE 
       transmitters and receivers: 

       o Security Policy Database (SPD): This database contains the 
          policies that determine the processing of all ULE 
          inbound/outbound traffic (such as encrypting all outbound ULE 
          traffic destined to a certain terminal). 

       o Security Association Database (SAD): Each entry defines the 
          parameters associated with one ULE-SID such as encryption 
          keys, keys and algorithms used for calculating the MAC, 
          presence of Sequence number and MAC. Each ULE-SID has an entry 
          in the SAD. 

       This document proposes to re-use existing techniques in IPsec 
       architecture and therefore the SPD and the SAD will follow the 
       format of these databases as defined in RFC 4301 [7]. The 
       security suite of algorithms for data encryption and data 
       authenticity / integrity specified in IPsec/MSEC will be used for 
       ULE security. The design of these databases will be simpler and 
       also the lookups because unlike in IPsec only the ULE-SID along 
       with the NPA address is needed to retrieve the data from these 
       databases. 

    2.2. Secure ULE SNDU Format 

       The security extension aims to secure the transmission of user 
       traffic over MPEG-2 Transport Streams.  In order to address the

       security issues, Figure 1 shows the SNDU format with the security 
       extension header. 

       This security extension is a standard extension header as 
       described in Section 5 of RFC 4326 [3] and it should not affect 
       the ULE base protocol. This security extension header MAY 
       directly follow the ULE base header as shown in Figure 1 or it 
       MAY also follow another specific extension header. 

       This security extension header is a Mandatory ULE Extension 
       header. This means that a receiver MUST either process this 
       header before it processes the next extension header or the 
       encapsulated PDU, otherwise the entire SNDU should be discarded.

       In Figure 1, the Type field in the base header denotes that the 
       mandatory security extension header is present. The receiver 
       destination NPA address is optional. After the base ULE header 
       the security extension header is followed. This header contains 
       the ULE-SID, the optional Sequence Number field and the optional 
       Message Authentication Code (MAC) field. The next type field 
       denotes the type of the enclosed PDU. The higher layer PDU is 
       encrypted and then encapsulated in the SNDU.

       address field directly follow and are used in the same way as 
       defined for standard ULE [3]. 

    2.2.1. Destination Address Absent (D) Field 

       The most significant bit of the Length Field carries the value of 
       the Destination Address Absent Field (D) which follows the same 
       definition as in standard ULE [3]. When D is set to 0, it 
       indicates the presence of the Destination Address Field while D 
       set to 1 indicates that a Destination Address Field is not 
       present. 

    2.2.2. Length Field 

       A 15-bit Length field denotes the length, in bytes, of the SNDU 
       counted from the byte following the Type field, up to and 
       including the CRC [3]. 

    2.2.3. Type Field 

       A 16-bit Type Field indicates that this is a Secure ULE SNDU [3]. 

       [XXX IANA ACTION REQUIRED XXX] 

       IANA action is required to assign the Type field for the security 
       extension header. 

       [XXX END of IANA ACTION XXX] 

    2.2.4. Destination NPA Address Field 

       The SNDU Destination Address Field is optional. This field is 
       MUST be carried when field D is set to 0 and may be omitted when 
       D=1 [3]. 

    2.2.5. ULE-SID Field 

       A 32-bit security identifier, the ULE-SID similar to the Security 
       Parameter Index (SPI) used in IPsec has been added to uniquely 
       identify the secure session. This ULE-SID would represent the 
       security association between the MPEG-2 transmitter and receiver 
       for a particular session and will indicate the keys and 
       algorithms used for encrypting the data payload and calculating 
       the MAC. The ULE-SID can be used by a receiver to filter PDUs 
       along with the NPA address.

    2.2.6. Sequence Number Field 

       An optional 32-bit sequence number has been added to the ULE SNDU 
       to prevent replay attacks. The gateway would monotonically 
       increment this number when it sends a packet to the receiver and 
       the receiver would verify the correct sequence number. If an 
       adversary tries to inject or replay old packets the sequence 
       number would not match. This would result in discarding the 
       packet. 

    2.2.7. Message Authentication Code (MAC) Field 

       To provide both data origin authentication and data integrity, a 
       Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used in the extension 
       header. 

       The MAC is calculated over the security extension header and the 
       encrypted data payload. The receiver would calculate the MAC for 
       the received packet and compare it with the transmitted value. 
       The two would not match in only 2 cases, firstly either there was 
       an error during processing or transmission over the MPEG-2 
       Network, or secondly the packet has not been sent from an 
       authenticated entity. 

       In either case, the packet should be discarded.  Hence the same 
       MAC can be used for data origin authentication and to provide 
       data integrity for transmission/processing errors. 

    2.2.7.1. Type Field 

       This second type field denotes the type of packet that is 
       encrypted and encapsulated in the Secure ULE SNDU. 

    2.2.7.2. Encrypted PDU 

       To achieve data confidentiality, the traffic between the MPEG-2 
       TS Transmitter (ULE Encapsulator) and Receiver needs to be 
       encrypted.  The network layer PDUs are first encrypted and then 
       encapsulated in the Secure ULE SNDU. The security associations 
       between the two communicating points will describe the algorithms 
       and keys used for encryption purposes. 

       Secure ULE does not impose the use of any specific encryption 
       algorithm and should be able to support the commonly used 
       algorithms like DES, 3DES etc.

    2.3. Transmitter Processing 

       The following procedure is followed at the encapsulator for 
       processing the security extension header for ULE: 

       o Upon reception of the higher layer PDU, the SPD is first 
          queried to check the policy to be applied to the packet. If 
          security is needed then an SA must exist in the SAD (this is 
          done by the key management system). The parameters are 
          retrieved from the SAD and the PDU is first encrypted using 
          the key and the algorithm as indicated in the SAD 

       o The header of the base protocol (and other extension headers 
          if present) would be added to the SNDU. 

       o The ULE-SID for the security association between the 
          transmitter and the receiver would be added next. 

       o The SAD would be used to see if the sequence number has to be 
          added. If yes, then the corresponding sequence number is added 
          to the SNDU. 

       o The SAD would also be checked to see if the data origin 
          authentication and data integrity has to be provided. If yes, 
          then the MAC has to be calculated. The MAC is calculated over 
          the encrypted PDU, the Security header i.e. the ULE-SID and 
          the Sequence Number (if present) and the secret key. The MAC 
          is then added to the extension header in the SNDU. 

       o Then the encrypted higher layer PDU is encapsulated to the 
          SNDU. 

       o Finally, the CRC is calculated as defined in Section 4.6 of 
          RFC4326 [3] and added. 

    2.4. Receiver Processing 

       The following procedure is followed at the receiver for 
       processing the security extension header for ULE: 

       o Upon reception of the Secure ULE SNDU, the receiver may first 
          filter the received packets according to the receiver 
          destination NPA address (if present). 

       o The CRC is verified as defined in RFC4326 [3]. 

       o It would then use the ULE-SID to obtain the security 
     
     
    Cruickshank           Expires December 21, 2006           [Page 10]

          associations between the transmitter and receiver and retrieve 
          the data from the SAD.  With this the receiver would know if 
          the sequence number and the MAC are present or not. This would 
          also be used to get the algorithms and keys used for both 
          encryption of the encapsulated PDU and for generation of the 
          message authentication code. 

       o It would then use the sequence number for filtering out any 
          out of-sequence packets. 

       o The next step would be to check the MAC to verify the 
          authenticity and integrity of the received packet.  If the 
          calculated MAC does not match the transmitted MAC, then the 
          packet is discarded. 

       o Finally the encapsulated payload will be decrypted. 

    3. Key Exchange Procedure 

       This section describes the key exchange procedure, used to 
       install and manage the keys at Receivers.  There is a need to 
       take into account the two cases described in [9], both 
       unidirectional and bi-directional transfers.  The key management 
       procedures are independent from the ULE operations.  During the 
       key exchange procedure, the ULE-SID will be defined. 

       The exact data encryption and data integrity choices are linked 
       to the key management systems in use. One example is the security 
       suite 1 (defined in GSAKMP [6]). This uses AES (CBC mode, Key 
       Length: 128 bits) for data encryption and DSS-ASN1-DER for 
       digital signature and SHA-1 as the Hash algorithm.  Other suites 
       will be added in future versions. 

       A detailed key management system is not presented in this 
       document, but two approaches are outlined. 

    3.1. IPsec Key Management for L2 

       Existing key management systems can be used such as the MSEC key 
       exchange protocols, GDOI and GSAKMP.  The format of the ULE-SID 
       will be identical to the security association as defined in GDOI 
       or GSAKMP. The initial key exchange between the security server 
       (which may reside with the NCC) and the ULE receiver can be 
       transported either within the ULE network or may be performed by 
       some other means.  This is a matter of policy and an architecture 
       decision. For example, for bi-directional transfers the whole key 
       exchange procedures could be carried within the ULE network, 
     
     
    Cruickshank           Expires December 21, 2006           [Page 11] 
        
    Internet-Draft         Security Extension for ULE      June 2006 
        

       while for unidirectional transfers, some other bidirectional 
       connection should be used. 

    3.2. Alternative Key Management 

       The method described here for link security could be used with 
       alternative key management systems when used as a part of a 
       system that already implements a key management infrastructure 
       (e.g. the DVB-RCS security system [5]). The format of the ULE-SID 
       will be the same format as defined in DVB-RCS security 
       procedures.

    5. Security Considerations 

       Link-level (L2) encryption of IP traffic is commonly used in 
       broadcast/radio links to supplement End-to-End security (e.g. 
       provided by TLS, SSH, Open PGP, S/MIME, IPsec).  A common 
       objective is to provide the same level of privacy as terrestrial 
       links. This document defines a method to provide optional link 
       encryption. The method may also support optional link level 
       integrity / authentication of the SNDU payload plus sequence 
       numbers for anti-replay attacks. This is provided in a flexible 
       way using a ULE Mandatory Extension Header.  This decouples 
       specification of the security functions from the encapsulation 
       functions. This method also supports encryption of the NPA 
       addresses. The encryption and integrity algorithms are similar to 
       the ones used in IPsec/MSEC protocols. 

    6. IANA Considerations 

       IANA action is required to assign the Type field for the security 
       extension header (Section 2.2.3).
