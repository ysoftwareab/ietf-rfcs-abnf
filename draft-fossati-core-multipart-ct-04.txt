1.  Introduction

   This memo defines multipart/core, an application-independent media-
   type that can be used to combine several different media types into a
   single CoAP [RFC7252] message-body with minimal framing overhead,
   along with a CoAP Content-Format identifier.

   This simple and efficient binary framing mechanism can be employed to
   create application specific request and response bodies which build
   on multiple already existing media types.

   Applications using the multipart/core Content-Format define the
   internal structure of the multipart/core representation.  Optionally,
   they might also register a new media type and an associated Content-
   Format identifier -- typically one in the range 10000-64999.

   One way to structure the sub-types specific to a multipart/core
   container is to always include them at the same fixed position.  This
   specification allows to indicate that an optional part is not present
   by substituting a null value for the representation of the part.

2.  Multipart Content-Format Encoding

   A representation of media-type multipart/core contains a collection
   of zero or more representations, each along with their respective
   content format.

   The collection is encoded as a CBOR [RFC7049] array with an even
   number of elements.  The second, fourth, sixth, etc. element is a
   byte string containing a representation, or the value "null" if an
   optional part is indicated as not given.  The first, third, fifth,
   etc. element is an unsigned integer specifying the content format ID
   of the representation following it.

Internet-Draft      Multipart Content-Format for CoAP          June 2018


   For example, a collection containing two representations, one with
   content format ID 42 and one with content format ID 0, looks like
   this in CBOR diagnostic notation:

      [42, h'0123456789abcdef', 0, h'3031323334']

   For illustration, the structure of a multipart/core representation
   can be described by the CDDL [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl] specification in
   Figure 1:

   multipart-core = [* multipart-part]
   multipart-part = (type: uint .size 2, part: bytes / null)

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  Registration of media type multipart/core

   IANA is requested to register the following media type [RFC6838]:

   Type name:  multipart

   Subtype name:  core

   Required parameters:  N/A

   Optional parameters:  N/A

   Encoding considerations:  binary

   Security considerations:  See the Security Considerations Section of
      RFCthis

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  RFCthis

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that need to
      combine representations of potentially several media types into
      one, e.g.  EST-CoAP [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]

   Fragment identifier considerations:  N/A

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  N/A

   Change controller:  IESG

   Provisional registration? (standards tree only):  no

3.2.  Registration of a Content-Format identifier for multipart/core

   IANA is requested to register the following Content-Format to the
   "CoAP Content-Formats" subregistry, within the "Constrained RESTful
   Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry, from the IETF Review space
   (specifically, 256..999):

              +----------------+----------+-----+-----------+
              | Media Type     | Encoding | ID  | Reference |
              +----------------+----------+-----+-----------+
              | multipart/core | --       | TBD | RFCthis   |
              +----------------+----------+-----+-----------+

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7049] apply.  In particular,
   resource exhaustion attacks may emply large values for the byte
   string size fields, or deeply nested structures of recursively
   embedded multipart/core representations.
