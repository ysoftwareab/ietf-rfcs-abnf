Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams    May      2005


1. Introduction 

AC-3 is a high quality audio codec designed to encode multiple channels
of audio into a low bit-rate format.  AC-3 achieves its large 
compression ratios via encoding a multiplicity of channels as a single 
entity.  Dolby Digital, which is a branded version of AC-3, encodes up 
to 5.1 channels of audio.
 
AC-3 has been adopted as an audio compression scheme for many consumer 
and professional applications.  It is a mandatory audio codec for 
DVD-video, Advanced Television Standards Committee (ATSC) digital 
terrestrial television, laser disc, and Digital Living Network 
Alliance (DLNA) home networking, as well as an optional multichannel 
audio format for DVD-audio. 

There is a need to stream AC-3 data over IP networks.  Applications for
streaming AC-3 include streaming movies from a home media server to a 
display, video on demand, and multichannel Internet radio.  RTP 
provides a mechanism for stream synchronization and hence serves as 
the best transport solution for AC-3, which is a codec primarily used 
in audio-for-video applications.  

Section 2 gives a brief overview of the AC-3 algorithm.  Section 3 
specifies values for fields in the RTP header, while Section 4 
specifies the AC-3 payload format, itself.  Section 5 discusses MIME 
types and SDP usage.  Security considerations are covered in Section 6 
and IANA considerations in Section 7.  References are given in 
Sections 8 and 9.  

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMEDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]. 

2. Overview of AC-3

AC-3 can deliver up to 5.1 channels of audio at data rates 
approximately equal to half of one PCM channel [2], [7], [8]. The ".1" 
refers to a band-limited, optional, low-frequency enhancement channel.
AC-3 was designed for signals sampled at rates of 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz. 
Data rates can vary between 64 kbps and 640 kbps, depending the number 
of channels and desired quality.

AC-3 exploits psychoacoustic phenomena that cause a significant 
fraction of the information contained in a typical audio signal to be 
inaudible.  Substantial data reduction occurs via the removal of 
inaudible information contained in an audio stream.  Source coding 
techniques are further used to reduce the data rate.

Like most perceptual coders, AC-3 operates in the frequency domain.  A 
512-point TDAC transform is taken with 50% overlap, providing 256 new 
frequency samples.  Frequency samples are then converted to exponents 
and mantissas.  Exponents are differentially encoded.  Mantissas are 
allocated a varying number of bits depending on the audibility of the 
spectral component associated with it. Audibility is determined via a 
masking curve.  Bits for mantissas are allocated from a global bit 
pool.

2.1 AC-3 Bit stream 

AC-3 bit streams are organized into synchronization frames.  Each AC-3 
frame contains a Sync Information (SI) field, a Bit Stream 
Information (BSI) field, and 6 audio blocks (AB), each representing 
256 PCM samples for each channel.  The entire frame represents a time 
duration of 1536 PCM samples across all coded channels (e.g., 32 msec 
@ 48kHz sample rate) [2]. Figure 1 shows the AC-3 frame format.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 1. AC-3 Frame Format

The Synchronization Information field contains information needed to 
acquire and maintain codec synchronization.  The Bit Stream 
Information field contains parameters that describe the coded audio 
service [2].  Each audio block also contains fields that indicate the 
use of various coding tools: block switching, dither, coupling, and 
exponent strategy.  They also contain metadata, optionally used to 
enhance the playback, such as dynamic range control.  Figure 2 shows 
the structure of an AC-3 audio block.  Note that field sizes vary 
depending on the coded data.

3. RTP Header Fields 

Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is specified

by the RTP profile under which this payload format is used, or 
signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).

Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to one to indicate that the RTP 
packet payload contains at least one complete AC-3 frame or contains 
the final fragment of an AC-3 frame. 

Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 

Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant for 
the first AC-3 frame in the RTP packet.  AC-3 encodes audio sampled 
at 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz.  Packets containing fragments of the 
same frame MUST have the same time stamp.  The timestamp of the first 
RTP packet sent SHOULD be selected at random; thereafter it increases 
linearly according to the number of samples included in each frame 
(i.e. by 1576 for each frame).

4. RTP AC-3 Payload Format 

According to [5], RTP payload formats should contain an integral 
number of application data units (ADUs).  An ADU shall be equivalent 
to an AC-3 frame.  To simplify the implementation of RTP receivers, 
each RTP packet MUST contain an integral number of complete AC-3 
frames, or one fragment of an AC-3 frame. 

If an AC-3 frame exceeds the MTU for a network, it SHOULD be 
fragmented for transmission within an RTP packet.  Section 4.2 
provides guidelines for creating frame fragments.

4.1 Payload-Specific Header 

There is a two-octet Payload Header at the beginning of each payload.  

4.1.1 Payload Header 

Each AC-3 RTP payload MUST begin with the following payload header.  
Figure 3 shows the format of this header.

              Figure 3. AC-3 RTP Payload Header

Frame Type (FT): This two-bit field indicates the type of frame(s) 
present in the payload. It takes the following values:
          0 - One or more complete frames.
          1 - Initial fragment of frame which includes the first 
              5/8ths of the frame.  (See Section 4.2.)
          2 - Initial fragment of frame, which does not include the 
              first 5/8ths of the frame.
          3 - Fragment of frame other than initial fragment.  (Note 
              that M bit in RTP header is set for final fragment.)

Number of frames/fragments(NF): An 8-bit field whose meaning depends 
on the Frame Type (FT) in this payload. For complete frames (FT of 0), 
it is used to indicate the number of AC-3 frames in the RTP payload.  
For frame fragments (FT of 1, 2, or 3), it is used to indicate the 
number fragments (and therefore packets) that make up the current 
frame.  NF MUST be identical for packets containing fragments of the 
same frame.

Must Be Zero (MBZ): Bits marked MBZ MUST have the value zero and are 
reserved.

4.2 Fragmentation of AC-3 Frames 

The size of an AC-3 frame depends on the sample rate of the audio and 
the data rate of the encoder (which are indicated in the 
"Synchronization Information" header in the AC-3 frame.)  The size of 
a frame, for a given sample rate and data rate, is specified in 
Table 5.18 ("Frame Size Code Table") of [2].  This table shows that 
AC-3 frames range in size from a minimum of 128 bytes to a maximum of 
3840 bytes.  If the size of an AC-3 frame exceeds the MTU size, the 
frame SHOULD be fragmented.

When an AC-3 frame is fragmented, it MAY be fragmented such that the 
first 5/8ths of the frame data is in the first fragment to provide 
greater resilience to packet loss.  This initial portion of a frame is 
guaranteed to contain the data necessary to decode the first two blocks 
of the frame.  Any other frame fragments are only decodable once the 
complete frame is received.  The 5/8ths point of the frame is defined 
in Table 7.34 ("5/8_frame Size Table") of [2].  

5. Types and Names

5.1 MIME Type Registration

MIME media type name:                   audio

MIME subtype name:                      vnd.dolby.dd-rtp

Required parameters:
        Rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate which is equal to the audio 
        sampling rate.  Permitted rates are 32000, 44100, and 48000.

        BSID: This parameter is a repetition of the Bit Stream 
        Identification field in the AC-3 bit stream [2].  It indicates 
        the version number of the bit stream.  An AC-3 decoder is 
        capable of decoding bit streams of a given version number and 
        all lower version numbers.  An AC-3 decoder is not capable of 
        decoding bit streams with higher version number.  In the AC-3 
        specification, BSID is a 5-bit unsigned integer, so the 
        maximum allowed value is 31.  BSID of 8 corresponds to AC-3 as 
        defined in [2].

Optional parameters:
        Channels: The number of channels present in the AC3 stream.
        This MUST be a number between 1 and 6. The LFE (".1") channel 
        MUST be counted as one channel.

        Ptime: The duration of time in milliseconds represented by the 
        AC-3 frame(s) in the packet.  

        Maxptime: The maximum duration of media which can be 
        encapsulated in each RTP packet, expressed as time in 
        milliseconds. 

Encoding considerations:
This MIME subtype is defined for RTP transport only.  The AC-3 
bit stream MUST be generated according to the AC-3 specification [2].  
The RTP packets MUST be packetized according to the RTP payload format 
defined in this document.

5.2 SDP Usage 

The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a 
specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
[3], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is 
used to specify sessions employing AC-3, the mapping is as follows:

   o   The MIME type  ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o   The MIME subtype  ("vnd.dolby.dd-rtp") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" 
       as the encoding name.

   o   The required parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as the 
       clock rate, optionally followed by the parameter "channel".

   o   The required parameter "BSID" goes in SDP "a=fmtp".

Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams    May      2005


   o   The optional parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP
       "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

An example of the SDP data for AC-3:
   m=audio 49111 RTP/AVP 100
   a=rtpmap:100 vnd.dolby.dd-rtp/48000/6
   a=fmtp:100 BSID=8

No special considerations are required when SDP is used in 
offer/answer mode.  No parameter negotiations are necessary because 
the design of AC-3 ensures that any AC-3 stream compliant to [2] is 
decodable by any decoder also compliant to [2].  For example, a stereo 
AC-3 decoder, in addition to decoding stereo content, is required to 
render a downmixed, stereo version of multichannel AC-3 content.

6. Security Considerations 

In order to protect copyrighted material, certain security precautions 
may be necessary.  The payload format described in this document is 
subject to the security considerations defined in any applicable RTP 
profile (e.g. [RFC3551]) and in [4].  The security considerations 
discussed in [4] imply the usage of encryption to protect the 
confidentiality of content.  Such an encryption scheme is harmless 
to the encoded audio data presuming the data is decrypted before being 
sent to the decoder.  A possible encryption mechanism is described 
in the profile in [9].

7. IANA Considerations

Registration of a new MIME subtype for AC-3 is requested (see 
Section 5.)
