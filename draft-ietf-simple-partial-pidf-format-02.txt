1.  Introduction


   The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) specifies the
   baseline XML based format for describing presence information.  One
   of the characteristic of the PIDF is that document always needs to
   carry all presence information available for the presentity.  In some
   environments where low bandwidth and high latency links can exist it
   is often beneficial to limit the amount of information that is
   transported over the network.


   This document introduces a new MIME-Type 'application/pidf-diff+xml'
   which enables transporting of only changed parts of the PIDF based
   presence information.


2.  Conventions


   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in RFC2778 [2].  In
   addition, the following terms are defined:


   Full presence document: A presence document that contains all the
      presentity's presence information that is available to a
      particular watcher.


   Partial presence document: A presence document that represents a
      fragment of the full presence document.  A partial presence
      documents can only be understood in the context of the full
      presence document, i.e., a partial presence document modifies a
      local copy of the full presence document.  A document with MIME
      type 'application/pidf-diff+xml' represents a partial presence
      document.



3.  Structure of partial PIDF documents


   The mechanism for implementing the partial PIDF requires defining a
   new MIME type which is named as 'application/pidf-diff+xml'.


   The data format is in principle similar to XCAP package [12] except
   that instead of the ETag a "version" attribute is used to ensure
   consistent updates.  The "version" attribute contains a sequence
   number that is progressively incremented by one between subsequent
   document updates i.e.  a more recent document update has a higher
   "version" value than the previous one.  The recipient of the document




Lonnfors, et al.         Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft                Partial PIDF                  October 2004



   can use the "version" attribute to properly order received documents.


   The partial PIDF document contains a collection of add, remove or
   replace operations which will be applied one-by-one in the given
   order to the current local composition presence document.  Each of
   the operations contains at least one XPath [15] compatible selector
   which is used to select a specific part within the local document.
   Furthermore, also the changed or added data content is given.  For
   example, when an add operation is being requested, the element onto
   which new data is going to be appended is searched first and then the
   new content is added.


   It is an error condition if any of the given operations can not be
   unambiguously fulfilled.


   In order to keep the update document as small as possible, the
   defined namespace prefixes and uri's within the current local
   document are used to expand location step prefixes just like in XCAP
   [11].  Given the full presence document is using a "pres" prefixed
   namespace definition and there's a selector "pres:presence" that has
   to be interpreted, the namespace definition has to be found from the
   local composition document.  As <presence> node happens to be the
   root node the definition for the namespace uri must be within that
   node.  As default namespaces can also be used, a selector like
   "presence" is interpreted as if it had an implicit default namespace
   uri attached.  It should be noted that when using add operation it is
   also possible that the namespace definition can be within the content
   of corresponding <add> element.


   Implementations using this document format must follow guidelines
   specified in the PIDF [4].  Specifically, the XML document MUST be
   well formed and SHOULD be valid.  Presence documents MUST be based on
   XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes
   use of XML namespaces for identifying presence documents and document
   fragments.  The namespace URI for elements defined by this
   specification is a URN [5], using the namespace identifier 'ietf'
   specified in RFC 2648 [6] and extended by RFC3688 [7].  This URN is:


   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf-diff


3.1  "version" attribute


   Every presence document compliant with this specification contains a
   "version" attribute in the <pidf-diff> element.


   Implementations MUST support a 32 bit integer in the version number.

Internet-Draft                Partial PIDF                  October 2004



3.2  "entity" attribute


   Every presence document compliant with this specification may contain
   an "entity" attribute in <pidf-diff> element.  It's content MUST then
   be the same than that of the full presence document.


3.3  <add> element


   The <add> element has two selection attributes: "parent" and "sel".
   The content of the "parent" attribute is used to select a single
   element from the local composition document onto which new data will
   be appended.  The second selector "sel" is a relative location step
   that will uniquely point after the append to the newly created
   element, text-node content or attribute within the "parent" selection
   context.  If there are several sibling elements in the new document
   the "sel" selector MUST include a position constraint to fulfill an
   unambiguous request.  The content of the <add> element is text for
   attributes and elements which have only text-content i.e.  XPath
   text() function is being used in the last location step.  For other
   elements the content of <add> element is enclosed with CDATA section
   and it inludes all the attributes and child elements and e.g.
   possible namespace definitions.


3.4  <replace> element


   The <replace> element has only one attribute: "sel" the content of
   which is used to select an element, a text-node content or an
   attribute that is going to be replaced with the new content.  The
   content of the <replace> element is the same as with <add> operation.


3.5  <remove> element


   The <remove> element has only one attribute: "sel" the content of
   which is used to select an element, text-node content or an attribute
   that is going to be removed.


4.  Usage of 'application/pidf-diff+xml'


   The partial presence document SHOULD only contain those elements or
   attributes that have changed.  However, when there are a lot of
   queued changes it may be desirable to send the full presence document
   content instead.  How this will be done in practice is beyond the
   scope of this document.  This document format allows to use the root
   node selector i.e.  "presence" which actually contains the full
   content of the presence document as there can only be one root node
   in any valid XML document.  It should be noted that it is still
   impossible to create a new document with this format, i.e.  first the
   full presence document has to be sent with the PIDF format and then




Lonnfors, et al.         Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                Partial PIDF                  October 2004



   only patches are sent with this format.


5.  Node Selector


   The ABNF [14] is used to describe the syntax for the node selector
   expressions.  The node selector syntax is defined to be XPath [15]
   compatible, but has a more restricted set of capabilities.  Each
   element selection has to point to a single node.  As the document
   root is always the starting point for selections relative location
   paths can be used.



   node-sel      = element-sel ["/" (attribute-sel / "text()")]
   element-sel   = element-step *("/" element-step)
   element-step  = ("*" / node-name) [conditions]
   conditions    = *("[" condition "]")
   condition     = 1*DIGIT /                       ; positional
                   cond-name "=" <"> value <">     ; value comparison
   cond-name     = "@" node-name /                 ; attribute selection
                   node-name     /                 ; element selection
                   "."                             ; current node selection
   node-name     = [prefix ":"] string
   prefix        = <any sequence of data supported by XML for namespace
                    prefixes>
   string        = <any sequence of data supported by XML for element or
                    attribute names>
   value         = <any sequence of data supported by XML for element or
                    attribute values>


   attribute-sel = "@" node-name

9.  Interoperability Considerations


   Systems compliant with CPP [9] will not be by default able to use
   this specification.  However, this will not cause any
   interoperability problems because all endpoints and gateways must
   support the default MIME type (application/pidf+xml) regardless if
   they support this specification.  Thus if a gateway or another end
   point does not understand this specification it will not be used.


   Other CPP compliant (other than SIP based) systems can also support
   this specification if they have a mechanism to indicate support for
   it.  If they do it is possible to build a gateway which will preserve
   end-to-end integrity with usage of partial PIDF.

10.  Security Considerations


   Presence information may contain highly sensitive information about
   the presentities.  The protocol used to distribute it SHOULD ensure
   privacy, message integrity and authentication.  Furthermore, the
   protocol should provide access controls which restrict who can see
   who else's presence information.  All security considerations
   identified for PIDF [4] apply unchanged for this document.
