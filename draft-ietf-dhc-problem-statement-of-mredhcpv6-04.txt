1.  Introduction

   The IP address plays a significant role in the communication of the
   Internet.  IP address generation is also closely related to the
   manageability, security, privacy protection, and traceability of
   networks.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
   [RFC8415] is a critical network protocol that can be used to
   dynamically provide IPv6 addresses and other network configuration
   parameters to IPv6 nodes.  DHCPv6 continues to be extended and
   improved through new options, protocols, and message processing
   mechanisms.

   Although DHCPv6 provides more and more comprehensive functionalities
   and DHCPv6 server software also provides extension interfaces to
   allow administrators to alter and customize the way how they handle
   and respond to DHCPv6 messages, there is still a lack of
   comprehensive insight into where and how to conduct extensions in
   DHCPv6 effectively.  The extensions to DHCPv6 can be various
   according to multiple and varied requirements.  The goal of multi-

   requirement extensions for DHCPv6 is to use simple interfaces to
   define and support more extensions without changing the basic design
   of DHCPv6.  Therefore, a detailed analysis is required to clarify the
   problems, design principles, and extract and unify the design
   specifications to help better solve the multi-requirement extension
   problems.

   In summary, multi-requirement extensions for DHCPv6 can be conducted
   to support the administrator's self-defined functionalities.  As
   DHCPv6 is an essential and useful protocol related to IPv6 addresses
   generation, it can provide more extended and flexible features to
   meet administrators' requirements.  According to well-designed
   principles, extended interfaces can be defined to support more self-
   defined multi-requirement extensions without sacrificing the
   stability of DHCPv6.

   Some people would suggest administrators modify the open-source DHCP
   servers to solve their problems.  However, a considerable amount of
   time will be taken to understand the open-source DHCP server codes,
   not to say the consuming time debugging the bugs, failures or system
   crash caused by modifying the complicated modules.  Another problem
   is that as the open-source software evolves, the source codes of the
   server software may change (new functionalities or fixing bugs).
   Users may need to re-write their codes once the latest version of
   open-source server software comes out
   [kea_dhcp_hook_developers_guide].  Hence, the multi-requirement
   extensions for DHCPv6 to solve administrators' specific problems are
   essential and significant.

   This document provides a survey of current extension practices and
   typical DHCP server software on extensions and gives DHCPv6 extension
   considerations by defining a DHCPv6 general model, discussing the
   extension problems, and presenting extension cases.

2.  Terminology

   Familiarity with DHCPv6 and its terminology, as defined in [RFC8415],
   is assumed.

3.  Current Extension Practices

3.1.  Standardized and Non-standardized DHCPv6 Extension Cases

   Many documents attempt to extend DHCPv6.  They can be classified into
   three categories.

   Extended options    Most extensions for DHCPv6 are implemented in
                       this way.  New-defined options carry specific

Internet-Draft       problem statement of mredhcpv6        February 2020


                       parameters in DHCPv6 messages, which helps DHCPv6
                       clients or servers know the detailed situation
                       with each other.

   Extended messages   Some documents define new protocols that aim to
                       achieve specific goals, e.g., active leasequery
                       [RFC7653], GAGMS [GAGMS].

   Extended entities   Some documents introduce third-party entities
                       into the communications of DHCPv6 to achieve
                       specific goals and provide better services, e.g.,
                       authentication [RFC7037].

3.2.  Current DHCPv6 Server Software Cases

   A lot of commercial and open source DHCP servers exist, including
   Cisco Prime Network Registrar [CPNR], Microsoft DHCP
   [Microsoft_DHCP], VitalQIP [VitalQIP], Nominum DHCP [Nominum_DHCP],
   ISC DHCP [ISC_DHCP], Kea DHCP [Kea_DHCP], FreeRADIUS DHCP
   [FreeRADIUS_DHCP], WIDE DHCPv6 [WIDE_DHCPv6], and DHCP Broadband
   [DHCP_Broadband].  Commercial and open-source DHCPv6 software often
   considers the extensions of DHCPv6 servers because they cannot always
   meet the requirements that the administrators want.  In this section,
   we introduce two typical DHCPv6 servers: Cisco Prime Network
   Registrar and Kea DHCP.

3.2.1.  Cisco Prime Network Registrar DHCP Server Extension APIs

   Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR) [CPNR] is an appliance which
   provides integrated Domain Name Server, DHCP, and IP Address
   Management services for IPv4 and IPv6.  At the same time, CPNR DHCP
   server provides extension APIs and allows administrators to write
   extensions and functions to alter and customize how it handles and
   responds to DHCP requests.  A network operator usually decides what
   packet process to modify, how to modify, and which extension point to
   attach the extension.  Then the network operator writes the extension
   and adds the well-written extension to the extension point of the
   DHCP server.  Finally, the network operator reloads the DHCP server
   and debugs whether the server runs as it expects.

3.2.2.  Kea DHCP Hook Mechanisms

   Kea DHCP provides hook mechanisms, a well-designed interface for
   third-party code, to solve the problem that the DHCP server does not
   quite do what a network operator require.  A network operator can use
   several well-defined framework functions to load and initialize a
   library and write specific callout functions to attach to the hook
   points.  After building and configuring the hooks library, the server

Internet-Draft       problem statement of mredhcpv6        February 2020


   runs as the network operator requires.  Additionally, Kea DHCP allows
   the network operator to use logging in the hooks library.

4.  Extension Discussion

   This section elaborates multi-requirement extensions for DHCPv6.
   Section 4.1 describes the general model of DHCPv6, while Section 4.2
   analyzes the extension points and requirements.

4.1.  DHCPv6 General Model

   Figure 1 summarizes the DHCPv6 general model and its possible
   extensions: messages, options, message processing functions, and
   address generation mechanisms.

4.2.  Extension Points

4.2.1.  Messages

   On the one hand, new messages can be designed and added to the DHCPv6
   protocol to enrich its functionalities.  For example, [RFC5007]
   defines new leasequery messages to allow a requestor to retrieve
   information on the bindings for a client from one or more servers.




Ren, et al.              Expires August 15, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       problem statement of mredhcpv6        February 2020


   [RFC7653] defines active leasequery messages to keep the requestor up
   to date with DHCPv6 bindings.

   On the other hand, people are concerned about the security and
   privacy issues of the DHCP protocol.  [RFC7819] and [RFC7824]
   describe the privacy issues associated with the use of DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6, respectively.  DHCPv6 does not provide privacy protection on
   messages and options.  Other nodes can see the options transmitted in
   DHCPv6 messages between DHCPv6 clients and servers.  Extended
   messages can be designed to secure exchanges between DHCPv6 entities.

4.2.2.  Options

   DHCPv6 allows defining options to transmit parameters between DHCPv6
   entities for common requirements, e.g., DNS [RFC3646] and SNTP
   [RFC4075].  Also, these parameters may come from external entities.
   For example, [RFC7037] defines RADIUS option to exchange
   authorization and identification information between the DHCPv6 relay
   agent and DHCPv6 server.

   In other cases, network operators may require DHCPv6 messages to
   transmit some self-defined options between clients and servers.
   Currently, the vendor-specific information option allows clients and
   servers to exchange vendor-specific information.  Therefore,
   administrative domains can define and use the sub-options of the
   vendor-specific information option to serve their private purposes.
   The content of the self-defined options may come from two sources:
   devices and users.  If the content of self-defined options comes from
   users, two methods can be used to solve the problem.  The first one
   is that the clients provide related interfaces to receive such
   information, which is currently merely supported.  The second one is
   that DHCPv6 relays obtain such information and add it to the clients'
   requests.  But this always depends on other protocols to allow DHCPv6
   relays to get the information first.

4.2.3.  Message Processing Functions

   Although current commercial or open-source DHCP server software
   provides comprehensive functionalities, they still cannot meet all
   customers' requirements of processing DHCP requests.  Therefore, they
   will offer interfaces that customers can use to write their specific
   extensions to affect the way how DHCP servers handle and respond to
   DHCP requests.  For example, not all networks prefer to use DHCPv6
   servers to assign the privacy-preserving random-form addresses
   generated by some fixed address generation mechanism to DHCPv6
   clients.  Thus, network operators may alter their DHCPv6 servers
   through the given extensions to use their preferred address

Internet-Draft       problem statement of mredhcpv6        February 2020


   generation mechanisms to assign addresses to DHCPv6 clients.
   However, not all DHCP software considers this extension.

4.2.4.  Address Generation Mechanisms

   Currently, the DHCPv6 servers assign addresses, prefixes and other
   configuration options according to their configured policies.
   Generally, different networks may prefer different address generation
   mechanisms.  Several address generation mechanisms for SLAAC
   [RFC4862] (e.g., IEEE 64-bit EUI-64 [RFC2464], Constant, semantically
   opaque [Microsoft], Temporary [RFC4941], and Stable, semantically
   opaque [RFC7217]) proposed for different requirements can be utilized
   in DHCPv6 protocol as well.  The many types of IPv6 address
   generation mechanisms available have brought about flexibility and
   diversity.  Therefore, corresponding interfaces could be open and
   defined to allow other address generation mechanisms to be
   configured.

5.  Extension Cases

   Administrative domains may enforce local policies according to their
   requirements, e.g., authentication, accountability.  Several kinds of
   multi-requirement extensions are presented in this section, including
   configurations in current DHCP software, option definition and server
   modification, and message definition between DHCPv6 entities and
   third-party entities.

   Currently, many DHCPv6 servers provide administrative mechanisms,
   e.g., host reservation and client classification.  Host reservation
   is often used to assign certain parameters (e.g., IP addresses) to
   specific devices.  Client classification is often used to
   differentiate between different types of clients and treat them
   accordingly in certain cases.

   More complicated extensions of DHCPv6 are needed to meet specific
   requirements.  For example, considering such a requirement that DHCP
   servers assign IP addresses generated by user identifiers to the
   clients in a network to hold users accountable, two extensions should
   be fulfilled to meet this requirement.  The first one is that clients
   send their user identifiers to servers.  This can be achieved by
   defining and using sub-options of vendor-specific information option.
   The second one is that servers use user identifiers to generate IP
   addresses.  To achieve this goal, extension mechanisms provided by
   the server software such as extension points in CPNR [CPNR] and hook
   mechanisms in Kea DHCP [Kea_DHCP] can be used.

   Some extensions for DHCPv6 may need the support of third-party
   entities.  For example, [RFC7037] introduces RADIUS entities into the



Ren, et al.              Expires August 15, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       problem statement of mredhcpv6        February 2020


   message exchanges between DHCPv6 entities for better service
   provision.  The authentication in [RFC7037] can also be used to meet
   the accountability requirement mentioned above because it is
   important to authenticate users first before assigning IP addresses
   generated from user identifiers.  Usually, this kind of extension
   requires the definition of messages communicated between DHCP
   entities and third-party entities, e.g., active leasequery [RFC7653].

   IPv6 addresses are related to manageability, security, traceability,
   and accountability of networks.  As DHCPv6 assigns IPv6 addresses to
   IPv6 nodes, it is important that DHCPv6 provides interfaces to allow
   administrative domains to conduct extensions to meet their multi-
   requirements.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related with DHCPv6 are described in Section 22 of
   [RFC8415].
