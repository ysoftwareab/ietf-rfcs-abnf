1.  Introduction

   The "arpa" top-level domain [RFC3172] is designated as an
   "infrastructure domain" to support techniques defined by Internet
   standards.  Zones under the "arpa" domain provide various mappings,
   such as IP addresses to domain names and E.164 numbers to URIs.  It
   also contains special use names such as "home", which is a non-unique
   name used in residential networks.

   Historically, the "arpa" zone has been hosted on almost all of the
   root name servers, and [RFC3172] envisages the "arpa" domain to be
   "sufficiently critical that the operational requirements for the root
   servers apply to the operational requirements of the "arpa" servers".
   To date, this has been implemented by serving the "arpa" domain
   directly on a subset of the root server infrastructure.

   This bundling of root server and "arpa" server operations has
   entwined management of the zones contents and their infrastructure.
   As a result, some proposals under consideration by the IETF involving
   the "arpa" zone have been discarded due to the risk of conflict with
   root operations.

   The separation described in this document resolves operational
   impacts of synchronizing edits to the root zone and the "arpa" zone
   by eliminating the current dependency and allowing more tailored
   operations based on the unique requirements of each zone.

2.  Requirements for the "arpa" zone

   The "arpa" domain continues to play a role in critical Internet
   operations, and this change does not propose weakening operational
   requirements described in [RFC3172] for the domain.  Future
   operational requirements for the "arpa" domain are encouraged to
   follow strong baseline requirements such as those documented in
   [RFC7720].

   Changes to the administration of the "arpa" zone do not alter the
   management practices of other zones delegated within the "arpa"
   namespace.  For example, "ip6.arpa" would continue to be managed in
   accordance with [RFC5855].

3.  Transition Process

   The process will dedicate new hostnames to the servers authoritative
   for the "arpa" zone, but will initially serve the "arpa" zone from
   the same hosts.

   Once completed, subsequent transitional phases could include using
   new hosts to replace or augment the existing root server hosts, and
   separation of the editing and distribution of the "arpa" zone from
   necessarily being connected to the root zone.  Any future management
   considerations regarding how such changes may be performed are beyond
   the scope of this document.

3.1.  Dedicated nameserver hostnames

   Consistent with the use of the "arpa" namespace itself to host name
   servers for other delegations in the "arpa" zone ([RFC5855]), this
   document specifies a new namespace of "ns.arpa", with the nameserver
   set for the "arpa" zone to be labelled as follows:

      a.ns.arpa
      b.ns.arpa
      c.ns.arpa
      ...

   Dedicated hostnames eliminate a logical dependency that requires the
   coordinated editing of the nameservers for the "arpa" zone and the
   root zone.  This component of this transition does not require the
   underlying hosts that provide "arpa" name service (that is, the root
   servers) be altered.  The "arpa" zone will initially map the new
   hostnames to the same IP addresses that already provide service under
   the respective hostnames within root-servers.net.

   Because these nameservers are completely in-bailiwick of the "arpa"
   zone, they will require glue records in the root zone.  This is
   consistent with current practice and requires no operational changes
   to the root zone.

3.2.  Separation of infrastructure

   After initially migrating the "arpa" zone to use hostnames that are
   not shared with the root zone, the underlying name service is
   expected to evolve such that it no longer directly aligns to a subset
   of root server instances.  With no shared infrastructure between the
   root servers and the "arpa" servers, future novel applications for
   the "arpa" zone may be possible.

   Any subsequent changes to the parties providing name service for the
   zone is considered a normal management responsibility, and would be
   performed in accordance with [RFC3172].

3.3.  Zone administration

   Publication of the "arpa" zone file to the authoritative "arpa" name
   servers is currently undertaken alongside the root zone maintenance
   functions.  Upon the separation of the "arpa" infrastructure from the
   root server infrastructure, publication of the "arpa" zone no longer
   necessarily needs to be technically linked or inter-related to the
   root zone publication mechanisms.

3.4.  Conclusion of process

   Full technical separation of "arpa" operations from root operations
   minimally requires the following to be satisfied:

   o  The "arpa" zone no longer shares any hostnames in its NS-set with
      the root zone;

   o  The hosts that provide authoritative name service are not the same
      hosts as the root servers, do not share any IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
      with the root servers, and are sufficiently separately provisioned
      such that any unique "arpa" zone requirements can be deployed
      without affecting how root zone service is provided;

   o  The editorial and publication process for the "arpa" zone has any
      common dependencies with the root zone process removed, so that
      the "arpa" zone can be managed, edited and provisioned wholly
      independently of the root zone.

   Such separation is ultimately sought to allow for novel uses of the
   "arpa" zone without the risk of inadvertantly impacting root zone and

   root server operations.  It is recognized that achieving this state
   requires a deliberative process involving significant coordination to
   ensure impacts are minimized.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall coordinate the creation of the "ns.arpa" namespace and
   populate it with address records that reflect the IP addresses of the
   contemporary root servers documented within "root-servers.net" as its
   initial state.

   The IANA will initially migrate the 12 NS records for the "arpa" zone
   to point to their respective new entries in the "ns.arpa" domain.

   Subsequently, the IAB and IANA will consult and coordinate with all
   relevant parties on activity to reduce or eliminate reliance upon
   root zone and root server infrastructure for serving the "arpa" zone.
   Such changes will be performed in compliance with [RFC3172] and shall
   be conducted with all due care and deliberation to mitigate potential
   impacts on critical infrastructure.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of the "arpa" zone is not necessarily impacted by any
   aspects of these changes.  Robust practices associated with
   administering the content of the zone (including signing operations)
   as well as its distribution will continue to be necessary.
