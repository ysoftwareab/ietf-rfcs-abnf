           Improving Privacy for the email "Received" Header
               draft-josefsson-email-received-privacy-00

Abstract

   The email "Received" header has a problematic privacy concern
   affecting email routing before or after handling by public SMTP
   relays.  This document discusses the problem and describes a solution
   that relevant Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) and Mail Submission
   Agents (MSAs) may adopt.

1.  Introduction

   As discussed in RFC 7624 section 3.3.4 [RFC7624], the Simple Mail
   Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [RFC5321] requires that each successive SMTP
   relay adds a "Received" header to the mail headers.  The purpose of
   these headers is to enable audit of mail transmission, and perhaps to
   distinguish between regular mail and spam.  An attacker that can
   observe sufficient email traffic can regularly update the mapping
   between public IP addresses and individual email identities.  Even if
   the SMTP traffic was encrypted on submission and relaying, the
   attacker can still receive a copy of public mailing lists.

   For example, when SMTP is used for message submission [RFC4409], this
   allows an attacker to learn the IP address of the host used by the
   individual who sent the email.  This consitutes a privacy leak.  The
   knowlege of the IP address of the user may be used to gather
   additional information about the user, or to simplify direct attacks
   against the host of the user.

   Privacy leaks may also happen when adding additional Received headers
   after an email has been delivered to the MX for the destination
   domain, where anyone who can observe the Received header can learn
   additional information about the internal network topology of a
   single organization.  The privacy relevance of this information
   depends on each organization.

   There may be other situations where adding Received headers would
   leak unintended information to an observing party.  For example, an
   organization may use different SMTP relays depending on the category
   of a customer.  By knowing the mapping between SMTP relay and
   customer category, an observing party would learn the customer
   category for the organization.

   Therefore we generalize the privacy problem we are interested in
   resolving to that which affect SMTP transfer or submission agents
   that the organization operating it considers appropriate to not leak
   potentially privacy sensitive information about.

   The purpose of this document is to propose a mechanism that
   implementers and operators of SMTP agents may adopt to remove the
   privacy leak.

   For ease of reference, the syntax of the Received header is defined
   in RFC 5322 section 3.6.7 [RFC5322] and the SMTP protocol requirement
   to add them is described in RFC 5321 section 4.4 [RFC5321].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Privacy-sensitive Received header Convention

   If the operator of an SMTP protocol entity, including transfer agents
   and submission agents, desires for improved privacy of the submitting
   entity, it MUST NOT add a Received header as discussed in section 4.4
   of RFC 5321.

3.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Philipp Winter for valuable feedback.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document resolves a privacy concern with Received header.  The
   privacy concern is discussed as a security consideration in section
   7.6 of SMTP [RFC5321] however that document does not provide any
   mechanism for implementers who are concerned with the problem to "opt
   out".

   The header is primarily intended to aid debugging, and according to
   RFC 5321 systems SHOULD be robust against unexpected information in
   the header.  Therefore, we believe no security considerations are
   introduced by the proposal in this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is adviced to add this document to the Reference column of the
   "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry.
