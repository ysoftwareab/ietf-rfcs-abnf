1.  Introduction

   The QUIC Transport Protocol [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] provides a
   secure, multiplexed connection for transmitting reliable streams of
   application data.  Reliability within QUIC is performed on a per-
   stream basis, so some frame types are not eligible for
   retransmission.

   Some applications, particularly those that need to transmit real-time
   data, prefer to transmit data unreliably.  These applications can
   build directly upon UDP [RFC0768] as a transport, and can add
   security with DTLS [RFC6347].  Extending QUIC to support transmitting
   unreliable application data would provide another option for secure
   datagrams, with the added benefit of sharing a cryptographic and
   authentication context used for reliable streams.

   This document defines four new DATAGRAM QUIC frame types, which carry
   application data without requiring retransmissions.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Motivation

   Transmitting unreliable data over QUIC provides benefits over
   existing solutions:




Pauly, et al.            Expires August 10, 2019                [Page 2]

   o  Applications that open both a reliable TLS stream and an
      unreliable DTLS flow to the same peer can benefit by sharing a
      single handshake and authentication context between a reliable
      QUIC stream and flow of unreliable QUIC datagrams.  This can
      reduce the latency required for handshakes.

   o  QUIC uses a more nuanced loss recovery mechanism than the DTLS
      handshake, which has a basic packet loss retransmission timer.
      This may allow loss recovery to occur more quickly for QUIC data.

   o  QUIC datagrams, while unreliable, can support acknowledgements,
      allowing applications to be aware of whether a datagram was
      successfully received.

   These reductions in connection latency, and application insight into
   the delivery of datagrams, can be useful for optimizing audio/video
   streaming applications, gaming applications, and other real-time
   network applications.

   Unreliable QUIC datagrams can also be used to implement an IP packet
   tunnel over QUIC, such as for a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
   Internet-layer tunneling protocols generally require a reliable and
   authenticated handshake, followed by unreliable secure transmission
   of IP packets.  This can, for example, require a TLS connection for
   the control data, and DTLS for tunneling IP packets.  A single QUIC
   connection could support both parts with the use of unreliable
   datagrams.

3.  Transport Parameter

   Support for receiving the DATAGRAM frame types is advertised by means
   of a QUIC Transport Parameter (name=max_datagram_frame_size,
   value=0x0020).  The max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter is an
   integer value (represented as a variable-length integer) that
   represents the maximum size of a DATAGRAM frame (including the frame
   type, datagram ID, length and payload) the endpoint is willing to
   receive, in bytes.  An endpoint that includes this parameter supports
   the DATAGRAM frame types and is willing to receive such frames on
   this connection.  Endpoints MUST NOT send DATAGRAM frames until they
   have sent and received the max_datagram_frame_size transport
   parameter.  Endpoints MUST NOT send DATAGRAM frames of size strictly
   larger than the value of max_datagram_frame_size the endpoint has
   received from its peer.  An endpoint that receives a DATAGRAM frame
   when it has not sent the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter
   MUST terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.  An
   endpoint that receives a DATAGRAM frame that is strictly larger than
   the value it sent in its max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter
   MUST terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

4.  Datagram Frame Type

   DATAGRAM frames are used to transmit application data in an
   unreliable manner.  The DATAGRAM frame type takes the form 0b001100XX
   (or the set of values from 0x30 to 0x33).  The least significant bit
   of the DATAGRAM frame type is the LEN bit (0x01).  It indicates that
   there is a Length field present.  If this bit is set to 0, the Length
   field is absent and the Datagram Data field extends to the end of the
   packet.  If this bit is set to 1, the Length field is present.  The
   second least significant bit of the DATAGRAM frame type is the
   DATAGRAM_ID bit (0x02).  It indicates that there is a Datagram ID
   field present.  If this bit is set to 0, the Datagram ID field is
   absent and the Datagram ID is assumed to be zero.  If this bit is set
   to 1, the Datagram ID field is present.

   A DATAGRAM frame is shown below.

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         [Length (i)]                        ...

                      Figure 1: DATAGRAM Frame Format

   The fields of a DATAGRAM frame are as follows:

   Datagram ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the datagram ID of
      the datagram (see Section 5.1).

   Length:  A variable-length integer specifying the length of the
      datagram in bytes.  If the length is zero, the data extends to the
      end of the QUIC packet.

   Datagram Data:  The bytes of the datagram to be delivered.

5.  Behavior and Usage

   When an application sends an unreliable datagram over a QUIC
   connection, QUIC will generate a new DATAGRAM frame and send it in
   the first available packet.  This frame SHOULD NOT be delayed, but
   MAY be coalesced with other STREAM or DATAGRAM frames.

Internet-Draft               QUIC Datagrams                February 2019


   When a QUIC endpoint receives a valid DATAGRAM frame, it SHOULD
   deliver the data to the application immediately.

   DATAGRAM frames MUST be protected with either 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys.

5.1.  Datagram Identifiers

   Since several applications relying on datagrams have the need to
   identify which application-level flow a given datagram is a part of,
   DATAGRAM frames carry a datagram identifier.  Applications that do
   not have a need for the identifier can use the value zero on their
   DATAGRAM frames and use the DATAGRAM_ID bit to omit sending the
   identifier over the wire.  If an application uses a mixture of
   DATAGRAM frames with and without the DATAGRAM_ID bit set, the frames
   without it are assumed to be part of the application-level flow with
   Datagram ID zero.

5.2.  Flow Control and Acknowledgements

   Although the DATAGRAM frame is not retransmitted upon loss detection,
   it does contribute to the maximum data for the overall connection.
   Packets that contain only DATAGRAM frames do need to be acknowledged,
   but implementations SHOULD defer and batch acknowledgements since the
   timing of these acknowledgements is not used for loss recovery.

   The DATAGRAM frame does not provide any explicit flow control
   signaling apart from the connection-level flow control.  DATAGRAM
   frames are flow controlled only when the maximum data for the
   connection is hit, at which point the BLOCKED frame is sent.

   In cases in which a DATAGRAM frame is blocked due to connection-level
   flow control or congestion control, an implementation MAY drop the
   frame without sending it.

6.  Security Considerations

   The DATAGRAM frame shares the same security properties as the rest of
   the data transmitted within a QUIC connection.  All application data
   transmitted with the DATAGRAM frame, like the STREAM frame, MUST be
   protected either by 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new value in the QUIC Transport Parameter
   Registry:

   Value:  0x0020 (if this document is approved)

Internet-Draft               QUIC Datagrams                February 2019


   Parameter Name:  max_datagram_frame_size

   Specification:  Indicates that the connection should enable support
      for unreliable DATAGRAM frames.  An endpoint that advertises this
      transport parameter can receive datagrams frames from the other
      endpoint, up to and including the length in bytes provided in the
      transport parameter.

   This document also registers a new value in the QUIC Frame Type
   registry:

   Value:  0x30 - 0x33 (if this document is approved)

   Frame Name:  DATAGRAM

   Specification:  Unreliable application data
