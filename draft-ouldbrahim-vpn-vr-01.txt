Abstract


   This draft describes a network based VPN architecture using virtual
   routers. The VPN service is built based on the virtual router (VR)
   concept, which has exactly the same mechanisms as a physical router,
   and therefore inherits all existing mechanisms and tools for
   configuration, operation, accounting, and maintenance. Within a VPN
   domain, an instance of routing is used to distribute VPN
   reachability information among VR routers. Any routing protocol can
   be used, and no VPN-related modifications or extensions are needed
   to the routing protocol for achieving VPN reachability. Virtual
   routers can be deployed in different VPN configurations, direct VR
   to VR connectivity through layer-2 or by aggregating multiple VRs
   into a single VR combined with IP or MPLS based tunnels. This
   architecture accommodates different backbone deployment scenarios,
   e.g. where the service provider owns their own backbone, and where
   the service provider obtains backbone service from one or more other
   service providers.

1. Introduction


   Several solutions have been put forward to achieve different levels
   of network privacy when building VPNs across a shared backbone. Most
   of these solutions require separate per VPN forwarding capabilities
   and make use of IP or MPLS based tunnels across the backbone [VPN-
   VR], [VPN-CORE], and [VPN-RFC2547].

   This document describes a network based VPN architecture using
   virtual routers. The architecture complies with the IP VPN framework
   described in [VPN-RFC2764]. The objective is to provide per VPN
   based routing, forwarding, quality of service, and service
   management capabilities. The VPN service is built based on the
   virtual router concept, which has exactly the same mechanisms as a
   physical router, and therefore inherits all existing mechanisms and
   tools for configuration, deployment, operation, troubleshooting,
   monitoring, and accounting. Virtual routers can be deployed in
   different VPN configurations, direct VR to VR connectivity through
   layer-2 links/tunnels or by aggregating multiple VRs into a single
   VR combined with IP or MPLS based tunnels. This architecture
   accommodates different backbone deployment scenarios, e.g. where the
   service provider owns their own backbone, and where the service
   provider obtains backbone service from one or more other service
   providers.

   Within a VPN domain, an instance of routing is used to distribute
   VPN reachability information among VR routers. Any routing protocol
   can be used, and no VPN-related modifications or extensions are
   needed to the routing protocol for achieving VPN reachability.

   VPN reachability information to and from customer sites can be
   dynamically learned from the CE using standard routing protocols or
   it can be statically provisioned on the VR. The routing protocol
   between the virtual routers and CEs is independent of the routing
   used in the VPN backbone. The routing protocol between the VRs maybe
   the same or it might be different than the routing mechanism used
   between the CE and VR.

   There are two fundamental architectures for implementing network
   based VPNs, virtual routers (VR) and piggybacking. The main
   difference between the two architectures resides in the model used
   to achieve VPN reachability and membership functions. In the VR

Ould-Brahim, et al.           July 2000                       [Page 3]
Internet-Draft      draft-ouldbrahim-vpn-vr-01.txt        January 2001



   model, each VR in the VPN domain is running an instance of routing
   protocol responsible to disseminate VPN reachability information
   between VRs. Therefore, VPN membership and VPN reachability are
   treated as separate functions, and separate mechanisms are used to
   implement these functions. VPN reachability is carried out by a per-
   VPN instance of routing, and a range of mechanisms is possible for
   determining membership (see section 6.0). In the piggyback model the
   VPN network layer is terminated at the edge of the backbone, and a
   backbone routing protocol (i.e. BGP-4) is responsible for
   disseminating the VPN membership and reachability information
   between provider edge routers (PE) for all the VPNs configured on
   the PE. [VPN-RFC2547bis] is an example of a piggyback VPN
   architecture.

2. Requirements

   This section lists some requirements addressed by the proposed
   architecture:

      (a) It should be easy to configure, deploy, operate and
           troubleshoot each VPN independently using existing
           mechanisms and tools.
      (b) The architecture should accommodate different levels of data
          and routing security.
      (c) The backbone internal nodes must not be VPN aware and will
          not keep any VPN state inside the backbone (for scalability
          purposes).
      (d) It is desirable to support the use of any routing protocol in
          the VPN domain and in the backbone.
      (e) The architecture must support overlapping VPN address spaces
          in separate VPNs.
      (f) Quality of service should be configurable per VPN.
      (g) The architecture should accommodate different sizes of VPNs,
          and one VPN should not impact other VPNs on the PE.
      (h) The addition of a new VPN site or the reconfiguration of an
          existing VPN site must not impact other VPNs.
      (i) The architecture should support direct paths between VPN
          sites that bypass the service provider backbone (backdoor
          links). Traffic can be directed to the backdoor link, or
          injected to the backbone with the flexibility of using both
          the backbone access, and the backdoor link as internal or
          external paths.
      (j) The architecture must work over different deployment
          scenarios, e.g. where the service provider owns their own
          backbone, and where the service provider obtains backbone
          service from one or more other service providers.
      (k) The architecture should not be limited to a single tunneling
          mechanism.

3. Network Reference Model

   A VPN customer site is connected to the provider backbone by means
   of a connection between a CE device, (which can either be a bridge
   or a router) and a virtual router. CE devices are preconfigured to
   connect to one (or more) VR(s).         M  ul tiple virtual routers
   coexist on the same service provider edge device (PE).

   CE devices can be attached to VRs over any type of access link (e.g.
   ATM, frame relay, ethernet, PPP or IP tunneling mechanism such as
   IPSec, L2TP or GRE tunnels).

                Figure 1: Network Reference Model


   CE sites can be statically connected to the provider network via
   dedicated circuits, or can use dial-up links. Routing tables
   associated with each virtual router define the site-to-site
   reachability for each VPN. The internal backbone provider routers
   (P) are not VPN aware and do not keep VPN state.


3.1 Backbone

   In general the backbone is a shared network infrastructure, which
   represents:

        (a)  A layer-2 ATM or frame relay network.
        (b)  An IP network.
        (c)  An MPLS network.


   Not all VPNs existing on the same PE are necessarily connected to
   the same backbone. The same backbone can be built from multiple
   transport technologies.


4. Virtual Router Definition


Ould-Brahim, et al.           July 2000                       [Page 5]
Internet-Draft      draft-ouldbrahim-vpn-vr-01.txt        January 2001



   A virtual router (VR) is an emulation of a physical router at the
   software and hardware levels. Virtual routers have independent IP
   routing and forwarding tables and they are isolated from each other.
   This means that a VPN's addressing space can overlap with another
   VPN's address space. The addresses need only be unique within a VPN
   domain.

   A virtual router has two main functions:

   1. Constructing routing tables describing the paths between VPN
      sites using any routing technologies (e.g., static, OSPF, RIP,
   or BGP).

   2. Forwarding packets to the next hops within the VPN domain.

   From the VPN user point of view, a virtual router provides the same
   functionality as a physical router. Separate routing, and forwarding
   capabilities provide each VPN CE link with the appearance of a
   dedicated router that guarantees isolation from other VPN traffic
   while running on shared forwarding and transmission resources.

   Virtual routers belonging to the same VPN domain must have the same
   Virtual Private Network Identifier (VPNID). An example of VPNID
   format is described in [VPN-RFC2685]. To the CE access device, the
   virtual router appears as a neighbor router in the CE based network,
   to which it sends all traffic for non-local VPN destinations. Each
   CE access device must learn the set of destinations reachable
   through its connection to the virtual router; this may be as simple
   as a default route. Virtual routers participating in a single VPN
   domain are responsible for learning and disseminating VPN
   reachability information among themselves. A given virtual router
   holds the routes only for the specific VPNs configured for that VR.
   Any routing protocol can be used between the VRs and the CEs.


5. How VPNs are built and deployed using VRs?

   Two main VR deployment scenarios can be used for building virtual
   private networks:

   . VR to VR connectivity over a layer 2 connections.
   . Aggregating multiple virtual routers over a single virtual router.

   The above VR deployment scenarios can coexist on a single PE and
   they are not mutually exclusive.


5.1 VR to VR Connectivity over Layer 2 Connections

   As illustrated in figure 2, virtual routers can be deployed over
   direct layer-2 frame relay or ATM connections or other layer-2
   transport technology.

   This type of VR deployment allows direct quality of service
   engineering per VPN connection basis. The connections can be
   statically configured or dynamically established.


5.2 Virtual Router Backbone Aggregation

   Another typical VPN configuration consists of connecting multiple
   virtual routers to the backbone through the use of a single virtual
   router (figure 3). For easy reference in the following sections
   let's call this single virtual router "the backbone virtual router"
   or "the backbone VR".

   The backbone virtual router is not functionally different than other
   virtual routers.  It is only a virtual router that is configured and
   deployed in a special configuration.

   The backbone virtual router connects each PE to a shared backbone
   infrastructure. Backbone virtual routers can be deployed over ATM,
   FR, IP, or MPLS networks. Since the backbone VR allows the
   aggregation of VPN VRs, backbone configuration remains unaffected as
   new VPN sites are added. The relationship between the VRs and the
   backbone VR is an overlay relationship. No routing relationship
   exists between the VRs and the backbone VRs.

   VPN data and routing information is tunneled through the use of IP
   or MPLS based tunnels. Other types of tunneling are not excluded
   with this architecture. The tunnels can be statically configured or
   dynamically established. The tunnel appears to VRs as a point-to-
   point link. Traffic sent through the tunnel, and forwarded by the
   backbone VR is opaque to the underlying backbone technology used.

   The backbone VR makes it appear as if each VR within a VPN is
   directly connected (full and partial mesh configurations supported).
   Each VR within the VPN exchanges routing information directly with
   the other VRs in the VPN.  The backbone VR exchanges routing
   information with other backbone entities (P routers and possibly
   other backbone VRs).

   Virtual routers can run any routing protocol on their local VPN
   domain. Both static routes and dynamic routing protocols such as
   RIP, OSPF, and BGP-4 can be used. VPN sites exchange routing
   information through the tunnels over the backbone.

   If a backdoor link is used between private CE based network running
   any IGP, then by adjusting the backdoor link costs appropriately,
   the backbone link can be favored for forwarding VPN traffic. By
   lowering the weight, the backdoor link can be used as a backup link
   in case the backbone path fails.


5.2.1 Relationship between the VRs and the Backbone VR

   The routing domain of a set of VRs participating in a single VPN has
   no relation to the routing domain of the backbone VR. The backbone
   VR is not necessarily aware of the routing instances running on each
   private virtual router.


5.2.2 Multiple Backbones connected to a single PE

   Figure 4 illustrates an example where multiple backbones are
   connected to the same PE. This type of configuration can be used
   when the PE is connected to multiple service provider backbones, or
   when the service provider offers different VPN services for
   different type of backbones.

6. VPN Topology and Membership Discovery

   The virtual router approach explicitly separates the mechanisms used
   for distributing reachability information from mechanisms used for
   achieving VPN topology determination. VPN membership information
   refers to the set of PEs that have customers in a particular VPN.
   VPN topology represents the set of PEs and their interconnectivity.
   The topology can be a full-mesh of PEs, a hub and spoke, or anything
   in between. Dynamic topology can also be handled due to on-demand
   VPN customers.


   VPN membership discovery can be achieved through different
   mechanisms, for example [VPN-ITU]:

   . Directory server approach, which VRs query a server to determine
     their neighbors.
   . Explicit configuration via a management platform.
   . Piggybacking VPN information using existing routing protocols
     (e.g., BGP) [VPN-BGP].

   The above mechanisms can be combined on a single PE. As an example,
   for some VPNs topology discovery is done only through a management

   platform. For others, dynamic topology discovery is achieved using
   existing routing protocol [VPN-BGP].


7. Operations and Management

   One of the greatest strengths of the VR approach to VPN creation is
   that all the existing tools for operating, managing and debugging IP
   networks can continue to be used without modification. All the
   standard MIBs, such as the forwarding/route table and interface MIBs
   are available.

   In case of PE failure (e.g. migration, upgrades, etc.), the service
   provider may want to control and decide what VPN services gets
   reestablished first. This particular point is important when a large
   number of VPNs is supported on the PE where each VPN service has
   different service availability requirements.

   Since each VR operates as an independent router, it is possible for
   the management of the VRs to be outsourced.  VPN customers may
   choose to configure (or perhaps only to monitor) the VRs that make
   up their VPN.  It is also possible that the backbone VRs could be
   managed by a separate entity.  Each VR operates independently, and
   can be individually reconfigured without effecting other VRs on the
   same PE.  In some implementations, it may even be possible for a VR
   to be "rebooted" by a customer without effecting other VRs.


7.1 Backbone Migration

   One benefit in using multiple backbone virtual routers is the
   ability for the backbone network administrator to migrate its
   backbone from one core technology to another with minimal disruption
   to VPN services. Indeed a VPN configuration change or a VPN-software
   upgrade is totally transparent to the backbone protocol and policies
   (this is due to decoupling the VPN routing protocol from the
   provider backbone routing protocol).


7.2 Troubleshooting

   The service provider or the VPN customer can use all existing
   troubleshooting tools per VPN basis (e.g. ping and traceroute). As
   an example a VPN customer can telnet to its own VR and performs some
   troubleshooting operations. In this particular case, the service
   provider can configure for each VPN customer restricted privileges
   over the virtual router associated with the customer VPN network.
   However, backbone topology information is completely hidden to the
   VPN VR, and therefore to the service provider customer.

8. Quality of Service

   This architecture can utilize different quality of service
   mechanisms. QoS mechanisms developed for physical routers can be
   used with VRs, on a per-VR basis. e.g. classification, policing,
   drop policies, traffic shaping and scheduling/bandwidth reservation.
   The architecture allows separate quality of service engineering of
   the VPNs and the backbone.


9. Scalability

   Only the PEs are handling the VPN type information. The internal
   backbone routers (the P routers) are not VPN aware. Furthermore,
   virtual routers allow multiple privates CE based networks to connect
   to a single PE.

   One advantage of the ability to contain the VPN address space and
   VPN routing and forwarding capabilities within the virtual router
   entity is the possibility to distribute PE system resources per VPN
   basis. Indeed, as an example, different scheduling mechanisms can be
   used for processing each VPN activity within the PE. This type of
   per VPN resource management contributes in establishing a wide range
   of priority schemes among VPNs within the PE.


10. Security Considerations

   Different levels of data, routing and configuration security can be
   implemented. Any existing security related mechanisms supported by
   existing routing protocols (e.g. authentication) can be used
   unmodified in the VR architecture. If IPSec tunneling is used as the
   tunneling protocol, then both the control and data traffic that
   travels over the tunnel can be secured; so that routing specific
   security enhancements are not needed. Any private routing,
   forwarding and addressing manipulation are done within the virtual
   router context. Direct layer-2 connections (ATM, FR), or specific
   tunneling mechanisms can also provide different levels of data
   security.
