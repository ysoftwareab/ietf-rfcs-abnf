Abstract

This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based Internets.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing devices and interfaces  that
conform  to  the Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON)  standards  as
defined  in  [802.3ah].  The  document contains  a  list  of  management
entities based on the registers defined in the [802.3ah] Annex  30A  and
mainly partitioned accordingly.

Terminology
The  key  words  "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
"SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and
"OPTIONAL",  when  used  in the guidelines  in  this  memo,  are  to  be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
For  a  detailed  overview of the documents that  describe  the  current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC
3410 [RFC3410].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally  accessed
through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects  in  the  MIB are defined using the mechanisms  defined  in  the
Structure  of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies  a  MIB
module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC
2578  [RFC2578],  STD  58,  RFC 2579 [RFC2579]  and  STD  58,  RFC  2580
[RFC2580].

2  Overview
This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based Internets.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing devices and interfaces  that
conform  to  the Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON)  standards  as
defined  in  [802.3ah].  The  document contains  a  list  of  management
entities based on the registers defined in the [802.3ah] Annex  30A  and
mainly partitioned accordingly.
The  document also contains a device group section defining the MIBs for
EPON form a device perspective, which are connected directly to the IEEE
802.3ah layer2 specifications.
The  document  also provides amendments to the 802.3 MAU MIBs  documents
for the EFM device type addition.

2.1 Relationship to the Interfaces MIB, the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
and the MAU MIB
EFM EPON interfaces require implementation of Interfaces MIB [RFC2863],
Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB [RFC2665] and MAU-MIB [RFC3636].
The MIBs defined in this document are an extension for these MIBs. For
instance defining dot3MpcpRemoteMACAddress only while assuming the local
MAC address attribute is already defined in [RFC 2665].

2.2 Relationship to the Generic EFM MIB
EFM EPON interfaces require implementation of Generic EFM MIB [draft-
ietf-hubmibùefm-mib]. This documents defines general EFM attributes and
managed objects that are referred in the document.

3   MIB structure

This  document include two MIBs the first is the EFM EPON MIBs  and  the
second is the EPON deivce MIBs.
The  EFM  EPON  MIBs  defines  the objects used  for  configuration  and
description of the [802.3ah] P2MP section.
These MIB objects are included of three MIB groups.
The  MPCP  MIBs definition û MIBs related to [802.3ah] clause  64  Multi
Point Control Protocol attributes. In this MIB group:
The  dot3MpcpTable  defines the objects used for the  configuration  and
description of the status of MPCP compliant interfaces.
The  dot3MpcpStatTable defines the statistics group for  MPCP  compliant
interfaces.

The OMPEmulation MIBs definitions û MIBs related to [802.3ah] clause  65
point to point emulation attributes. In this MIB group:
The dot3OmpEmulationTable defines the objects used for the configuration
and description of the status of OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.
The   dot3OmpEmulationStatTable  defines  the   statistics   group   for
OMPEmulation compliant interfaces.

The  MAU  MIBs  definition including MAU type definitions and  EPON  MAU
managed object related to [802.3ah] clause 60 and clause 65.
The  dot3EponMauTable  defines the objects used  for  the  configuration
and description of the status of MAU EPON compliant interfaces.
The dot3EponMauType defines the Type group for [802.3] EPOM MAUs.
Editor  note  - The MAU Type object should probably be with other  802.3
MAU type oblects [RFC 3636].

The  EPON  Device  MIBs defines the objects used for  configuration  and
description of management objects for EPON compliant Devices.
The  eponDeviceTable defines the objects used for the configuration  and
description of the EPON compliant devices.

6. Security Considerations

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Most objects are writeable
   only when the link is Down. Writing to these objects can have the
   following potentially disruptive effects on network operation:
   Including for example:
        enabling or disabling a MAU or device type
        changing a device state server/client ONU/OLT default type
        enabling, disabling or restarting autonegotiation
        modifying  the  capabilities  of  the  link  û  PMD  parameters,
     enabling/disabling FEC.
   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
