Abstract

   This document considers a mobile terminal with multiple interfaces
   which uses Mobile IPv6[1].  With multiple interfaces, the mobile
   terminal may use them simultaneously for communication with a peer
   device.  Hence enabling the mobile terminal to achieve fault
   tolerance, load balancing and so on.  This document deals with the
   mobile terminal with multiple interfaces, so it is possible that each

   kind/type of interface may have its own characteristics or
   differences.

   In particular, we take a closer look at the path between mobile
   terminal and its home agent.  In the case when the mobile terminal
   has multiple interfaces, there exists several paths to the home
   agent.  A general approach would be to first take a look at effective
   use of the multiple interfaces from a pure Mobile IPv6 perspective.
   As a matter of course, RFC3775 is used as the basic reference with
   which we consider the multiple interfaced mobile terminal operating
   in a Mobile IPv6 environment.

1.  Introduction

   Today's consumer electronics market has seen an explosion of devices
   containing more than one type of wireless interface.  As a greater
   amount of functionality is packed into each user terminal, cell
   phones with PDA-like capabilities are becoming more common.  Users of
   such multimode devices typically desire "always on" internet access
   at the lowest possible cost, hence the proliferation of multimode
   devices with diverse wireless interfaces such as WLAN and WPAN in
   addition to the de facto cellular network connectivity.

   By utilizing the more reliable cellular coverage for making voice
   calls and WLAN or WPAN connectivity for other forms of digital data
   communications, the user may more effectively leverage upon the
   strengths of each technology.  A foreseeable scenario involves the
   user purchasing some entertainment content through the cellular
   service operator.  The user or the service operator may now choose to
   receive or transmit the stream via a more economical wireless
   interface.  While enjoying the bought content, a voice call is put
   through to the user's handset and the user effortlessly receives the
   call, ends it and resumes his entertainment.

   In this document, we analyze similar scenarios in greater detail and
   discuss the required functionalities on the mobile terminal and
   network in order to achieve it.


2.  Terminology

   General mobility terminology can be found in Mobile IPv6[1]


3.  Scope

   It is the intention of this draft to focus on the notification
   mechanism for multiple interfaces.


4.  Limitations with Mobile IPv6 and Multiple CoAs Registrations

4.1.  Impact of Multiple Interfaces on Mobile IPv6

   The following sections describe some considerations regarding
   multiple interfaces which the mobile node using Mobile IPv6 has.

4.1.1.  Use of the interface as one forwarding destination

   Mobile IPv6 allows the mobile node to continue to communicate with a

   correspondent node regardless of mobility.  The tunnel between the
   mobile node and its home agent connects the correspondent node to the
   mobile node when the mobile node is away from home, providing session
   continuity.  However Mobile IPv6 assumes that the mobile node uses
   only one interface at a point in time.  If the mobile node has
   multiple interfaces, it must choose one and notify the home agent of
   its selected interface.  The selected interface is used as the
   forwarding destination by the home agent for packets addressed to
   HoA.  When the mobile node wants to select another interface, it must
   notify the home agent of its new forwarding destination.  Basically,
   even if the mobile node has multiple interfaces which are usable, it
   can use only one of them as the forwarding destination.

   When a home agent serves as a mobile node's home agent, it intercepts
   packets to the mobile node's HoA, searches the Binding Cache for the
   HoA entry.  It then tunnels the intercepted packets to the CoA found
   in the binding cache entry.  In this case, this CoA is the forwarding
   destination.  On the other hand, if the home agent does not serve as
   the mobile node's home agent, it does not intercept packets to the
   mobile node's HoA.  Hence all packets to the mobile node's HoA are
   received by the mobile node directly via the home network.  In this
   case, there is no forwarding destination in the home agent.

4.1.2.  Need of multiple forwarding destinations

   As stated in Section 4.1.1, the mobile node needs to send a binding
   update to notify the home agent of the forwarding destination.  So,
   as described in MCoA[2], in order to enable the home agent to
   initiate the change of the forwarding destination, the mobile node
   should notify the home agent of possible alternatives for the
   forwarding destination.  According to MCoA[2], when the mobile node
   is connected to both home and foreign networks, it can use only
   either the interface attached to the home network or the interface
   attached to the foreign network.  It is important to allow the
   selection of source or forwarding destination at either endpoint of a
   path, regardless of the network the mobile node is connected to.

4.2.  Path between the mobile node and the correspondent node

   The following sections describe the mechanism for utilizing the
   direct path between the mobile node and the correspondent node.

4.2.1.  Another path to the CN

   Looking at the communication between the mobile node and CN, the CN
   knows only the peer node's address as an initial condition.  The CN
   is not aware that the peer node is a mobile node.  If the mobile node
   is at its home network, the packets sent by the CN are routed to the



Aso & Koh               Expires December 28, 2006               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Multiple Forwarding Destinations           June 2006


   mobile node directly.  If the mobile node is away from home, they are
   routed by the home agent to the mobile node.

   Currently, Mobile IPv6 has available a mechanism to inform the CN
   about the existence of another path and that is route optimization.
   By using this mechanism, the CN could be made aware of another direct
   path between itself and the peer node.  In this case, there are now
   two paths between the mobile node and the CN.  When the CN sends the
   packet, it may prefer the direct path because the direct path is
   typically shorter than the other one.

4.2.2.  Meaning of the notified path to CN

   The path notified from the mobile node to CN has the meaning of
   "optimized path" and Mobile IPv6 fundamentally already incorporates a
   mechanism to inform a peer of the difference regarding multiple paths
   to the same node.  The existence of two different paths arises from
   the mobility of the mobile node as well as the presence of a home
   agent.  Such a meaning is not provided between the home agent and the
   mobile node.


5.  Simultaneous Location Scenario

   Consider the scenario when a user's mobile terminal is both cellular
   and WLAN enabled.  The cellular connection is provided by a cellular
   operator.  The WLAN connection is obtained via a wireless hotspot in
   a restaurant.  The user intends to utilize a video conferencing
   application while simultaneously participating in an online game.
   For reasons of cost versus quality of service, the user would like to
   utilize his cellular connection for his video streams and the free
   WLAN connection for his online game.  For this purpose, he proceeds
   to register the location address and set the appropriate policies on
   his home agent in his house.  The home agent is supposed to select
   suitable interface to forward the specific flow based on such
   policies set by the user.

   At one point, when the user leaves the hotspot and goes into his
   house, the WLAN interface connects to the WLAN network which is the
   home network to which user's home agent is attached to.  The network
   configuration after this movement is called as "simultaneous
   location".  This indicates that mobile node is connecting to both
   home network and foreign network simultaneously.  In this case, WLAN
   network is providing the mobile node with not only access service but
   also mobility service.  On the other hand, cellular network is
   considered as the provider of access service in terms of mobility
   service provided by user's WLAN network even though it has the home
   agent.  Of course, above WLAN network/home agent in user's house

   could be replaced with the WLAN network/home agent provided by the
   user's company, or the cellular network could provide the mobile node
   with the home agent.

   Figure 1 shows the cellular network operated by a cellular operator
   and WLAN network operated in User's house/company which provides the
   home agent.  The WLAN interface(IF1) is connected to WLAN network and
   cellular interface(IF2) is connected to the cellular network.  As
   described above, the mobile terminal is connected to both home and
   foreign network via its two interfaces.

   Figure 1: Network Configuration

   There are two possible paths between the home agent and the mobile
   terminal.  The first is the direct path (Path1) from the home agent
   via the mobile node's WLAN interface and the other is through the
   foreign network via the mobile terminal's cellular interface (Path2).
   According to current Mobile IPv6 protocol, when communicating with a
   CN without using Route Optimization the mobile terminal and home
   agent may choose to use either Path1 or Path2.


6.  Problem Statement

   In the above described scenario, the home agent is not able to
   initiate a change of forwarding destination.  Even if both interfaces
   are available, the existence of a binding cache entry in the home
   agent reflects only a part of several possible locations of the

   mobile node.  This seems to be the same problem as conventional
   Mobile IPv6 without multiple CoAs registration and it creates
   overheads due to the inefficient sending of messages and replies.
   The policies set by the mobile node before the movement is no longer
   available because the home agent does not know of the existence of
   multiple paths between itself and the mobile node.

   If the mobile node uses IF2, there must be a binding cache entry for
   HoA and CoA at the home agent.  In this case for packets sent from
   the CN, the home agent must intercept the packets addressed to the
   mobile node's HoA and tunnel them to the mobile node.  For packets
   sent from the mobile node, the mobile node must utilize the reverse
   tunnel and send the packets to the home agent which then decapsulates
   the tunneled packets and forwards the inner packets to the CN.
   Thereby the mobile node can send and receive the packets utilizing
   interface IF2.  If the mobile node chooses to use IF1, there must not
   be any binding cache entries at the home agent.  In this case, the
   mobile node does not need to use any reverse tunnel.  It can use it's
   own HoA normally to send packets and the home agent is not involved
   in the packet transmission.


7.  Possible Operation for the mobile node with multiple interfaces

   This section introduces some possible operations to achieve
   simultaneous use of multiple interfaces and describes the
   consideration on actual operation.  Their operations is based on use
   of CoA in home link.

   According to MCoA[2], the mobile node that is returning home has two
   options.  The first is the mobile node chooses to use the home
   attached interface, the second is the mobile node selects the foreign
   attached interface.  This document proposes the third option which is
   the mobile node chooses to utilize both the home attached and foreign
   attached interfaces.  Some possible operational details for this
   option is described below.

7.1.  Network based solution

   This method makes the home link appear to be the foreign link for the
   mobile node by advertising a prefix other than the home prefix.
   Typically when the advertised prefix is different from the home
   prefix, the mobile node considers the link to be a foreign link even
   if the home agent is connected to the link.  The process for the
   mobile node when it connects to the home link in this operation is to
   register a CoA at the home agent at all times without noticing that
   it is attaching to the home link.

   The mobile node with a single interface should use its own Home
   Address in the home link.  However, in this case, the MIPv6-only
   mobile node can not perform the returning home procedure at all
   times.  The mobile node with multiple interfaces should be able to
   select between registering the CoA and performing the returning home
   procedure for effective usage of the home attached interface.
   However, in this case, all the MCoA-capable mobile node can do is
   register the CoA similar to the MIPv6-only mobile node.  Even for the
   mobile node with multiple interfaces utilizing only the home attached
   interface, it has to register the CoA from the home link.

   Figure 2 shows the network configuration on Foreign Link the Home
   Agent connects.  The Home Agent does not advertise the home prefix.
   On the other hand, the Default Router is advertising prefix A in the
   home link.  So, this link is considered to be a foreign link by the
   connecting mobile node.  Both the MIPv6-only mobile node and MCoA-
   capable mobile node creates a CoA using prefix A and registers it to
   the home agent.

7.1.1.  Advertising both home prefix and other prefix

   As described above, when only prefix A is advertised in the home



Aso & Koh               Expires December 28, 2006               [Page 8]

   link, the mobile node can not detect that it is attaching to the home
   link.  In order to allow the MIPv6-only mobile node to recognize the
   home link, it needs the home prefix to be advertised in the link.  In
   this case, at least two prefixes are visible for mobile node in the
   link and the mobile node can use them for detecting both home and
   foreign links.  A Router Advertisement message can contain several
   prefix options so when several prefixes belong to the same router,
   the router can use one Router Advertisement message to advertise them
   at the same time.  Of course, it can also use separate Router
   Advertisement messages for advertising each prefix.

7.1.1.1.  Separate Advertising

   If the home agent advertises the Home Prefix and Other Prefix
   separately, both the MIPv6-only mobile node and MCoA-capable mobile
   node still connects to the home link as a foreign link if it receives
   the Other Prefix before receiving the Home Prefix.  In order for the
   MIPv6-only mobile node to avoid detecting the Other Prefix, a simple
   method may be to introduce a new dedicated option for carrying the
   Other Prefix.  However, this would not change the result of the MCoA-
   capable mobile node recognizing that it is in the home link.  This is
   not the intention of using Foreign link with the Home Agent.

7.1.1.2.  Simultaneous Advertising

   In order for the MIPv6-only mobile node to avoid detecting the Other
   Prefix before finding the Home Prefix, another simple method is to
   advertise the Home Prefix and the Other Prefix together.  In this
   case the MIPv6-only mobile node may be able to avoid using the Other
   Prefix.  However, it also would not change the result of the MCoA-
   capable mobile node recognizing that it is in the home link.  So, it
   is difficult to mislead the MCoA-capable mobile node into believing
   it is in a foreign link while still allowing the MIPv6-only mobile
   node to know that it is in the home link.

7.2.  Mobile Node based solution

   In section Section 7.1, the scenario for using Other Prefix in the
   home link is described.  This section describes the scenario for
   using the Home Prefix.  This method does not keep the mobile node
   from noticing that it is attached to the home link.  The MCoA-capable
   mobile node should also be able to notice that it is attached to the
   home link in order for it to be able to choose between registering a
   CoA or performing the returning home procedure.

   This method requires the mobile node to create a CoA(HomeCoA) from
   the Home Prefix in the home link which is different from the HoA.
   The mobile node then notifies the home agent of both its addresses.

   This enables the home agent to continue to intercept the packets
   addressed to the mobile node's HoA.  The advantage is that the MIPv6-
   only mobile node can perform the returning home procedure normally
   whenever it connects to home link.  The detection of the home link is
   achieved by checking the prefix included in Router Advertisement sent
   by home agent.  On the other hand, the MCoA-capable mobile node can
   choose between using the HomeCoA and performing the returning home
   procedure for the home attached interface.

   Figure 3 shows the network configuration on normal Mobile IPv6 home
   Link.  The Home Agent advertises the home prefix and hence this
   network is considered as the home link by the connecting mobile node.
   The MIPv6-only mobile node can use its own HoA(pH.HoAm) directly
   without interception by the home agent.  On the other hand, the MCoA-
   capable mobile node can create a CoA(pH.CoAc) from the home prefix
   and register it with the home agent after noticing that it is
   attached to the home link.  This method allows IF2's binding cache to
   be kept simultaneously with IF1.  Of course, if the MCoA-capable
   mobile node does not use IF2, it can choose to use its own
   HoA(pH.HoAc) directly without interception by the home agent.

7.3.  Modified Binding Unique Identifier sub-option

   In the case that the mobile node creates a CoA in the home link
   regardless of whether it is using the Home Prefix or Other Prefix, it
   must set the H flag in the Binding Unique Identifier option in order
   to notify the home agent that the address included in the option is a
   HomeCoA.  A new flag (H) is included in the Binding Unique Identifier
   sub-option to allow the home agent to differentiate between the CoA
   in the home link from the CoA in a foreign link.  This
   differentiation is useful for the home agent when considering the
   shortest path to the mobile node.  This is similar to the situation
   between the correspondent node and the mobile node because the
   correspondent node can learn of the existence of paths and the path's
   characteristics through the route optimization mechanism.

      CoA Registration in home link (H) flag

         The CoA Registration in home link (H) flag is set by the
         sending mobile node to indicate to the home agent that the
         Care-of Address identified by this BID is a CoA in the home
         link.  If the flag is set, the home agent assumes that the CoA
         contained in the Binding Update is a CoA in the home link.  The
         CoA can be included in the Source Address Field or the
         Alternate CoA option.

   This modified Binding Unique Identifier sub-option is based on
   MCoA[2].  If MCoA[2] is updated, this flag could be easily applied to
   the updated Binding Unique Identifier sub-option.

   The binding cache of the home agent is as follows when the H flag is
   set in case of Figure 3.  This difference between a CoA in the home
   link and a CoA in the foreign link is a Mobile IPv6 specific feature
   hence this is notified using normal CoA registration.

8.  Backward Compatibility

   It is important for MCoA to keep backward compatibility with Mobile
   IPv6 to achieve coexistence between the mobile node using Mobile IPv6
   and the mobile node using MCoA.  Also the mobile node using Mobile
   IPv6 should be able to utilize the advantage defined in RFC3775 which
   was designed for use with a single interfaced mobile node.  Also, the
   extension for Mobile IPv6 should not disrupt the operation of Mobile
   IPv6.

   Specifically, the operation on returning home in Mobile IPv6 is
   useful for the mobile node which wants to use own HoA directly
   without interception by the home agent.  However, if some other
   prefix is advertised in the home link, the mobile node may not be
   aware that it is attached to the home link.  The result is that it
   can not perform returning home procedure.  This may be good for the
   mobile node that is using multiple interfaces at all times but not
   for the mobile node that is using only one interface at a time (even
   if the mobile node has multiple interfaces).  As such, the method to
   allow the MCoA-capable mobile node to create a CoA in the home link
   by advertising a prefix other than home prefix is disadvantageous and
   redundant for both the MIPv6-only mobile node and MCoA-capable mobile
   node.  The method based on the normal Mobile IPv6 home link is simple
   and can keep backward compatibility with Mobile IPv6.  For the mobile
   node with a single interface, the returning home procedure should be
   used.  For the mobile node with multiple interfaces, it should be
   able to choose to register a CoA or perform the returning home
   procedure.


9.  Conclusion

   In order to allow the home agent to initiate a change of forwarding
   destination in the described scenario, the use of CoA in the home
   network enables flow control based on policies set by the mobile node
   even when it is attached to the home and foreign networks
   simultaneously.  Moreover, it is obvious that using the home prefix
   rather than some other prefix to form the CoA is desirable because it
   can maintain backward compatibility with Mobile IPv6.  For
   representing the explicit difference in home and foreign paths
   between the home agent and mobile node, this document introduces the
   Modified Binding Unique Identifier sub-option.

   This work explains the mobile node and the home agent operation which
   can be applied to the situation where the mobile node is connected to
   both home network and foreign networks.

10.  Security Considerations

   As this operation follows Mobile IPv6 operations, no additional
   security issues have been identified.

   Please refer to the Mobile IPv6 specification [1] for security
   considerations.
