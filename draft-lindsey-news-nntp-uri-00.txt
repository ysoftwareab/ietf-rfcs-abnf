Abstract

   This document specifies the news and nntp Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) schemes that were originally specified in [RFC
   1738].  The purpose of this document is to allow [RFC 1738] to be
   made obsolete while keeping the information about the scheme on
   standards track.

   It is based on the earlier draft-hoffman-news-nntp-uri-04.txt
   written by Paul Hoffman.

                     The news and nntp URI Schemes              May 2005

1.  Introduction

   URIs are defined in [RFC 3986].  That document also specifies how to
   define schemes for URIs.

   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in [RFC 1738].
   Because that document has been made obsolete, this document copies
   and adapts the news and nntp URI schemes from it to allow that
   material to remain on standards track.

        NOTE: the definitions for the news and nntp URI schemes given
        here are significant updates from [RFC 1738] based on modern
        usage of these schemes.

   The keywords "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY" are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC 2119].  Syntax is described using the ABNF notation
   described in [RFC 2234].

2.  The News URI Scheme

   The news URI scheme is used to refer to either news groups or
   individual Netnews articles, as defined in [RFC 1036].

   The news URI takes the form:

      newsURI           = "news:" ( article / collection )
      article           = [ news-server "/" ] message-id
      collection        = [ news-server "/" ] wildmat /
                          [ news-server [ "/" ] ]
      news-server       = "//" authority
      message-id        = printable-ascii "@" printable-ascii
      newsgroup-name    = %x22-29 / %x2B / %x2D-3E / %x40-5A / %x5E-7E
                                     ; excludes "*" "," "?" "[" "
      printable-ascii   = 1*( %d33-61 / %d63-126 ) ; excludes ">"

   <authority> is defined in [RFC 3986], and provides for a <host>, a
   <port> (defaulting to 119 in this scheme) and possibly a <userinfo>.
   <wildmat> is defined in [NNTP], and provides for a single
   <newsgroup-name>, or for a collection of <newsgroup-name>s separated
   by ','s and using '*' and '?' for wild cards and '!' for negation.

   Within a <printable-ascii> or a <wildmat>, the characters '%', '@',
   '/' and '#' are reserved and MUST be %-encoded if they occur. All
   other characters MAY be used freely to represent themselves. It is
   not precluded that future extensions for internationalized
   <newsgroup-name>s may permit octets outside of the given ranges, in
   which case they too MUST be %-encoded (except perhaps when used in an
   IRI [RFC 3987]).

   If no <news-server> is specified, the resources are to be retrieved
   from whatever server has been configured for local use.




C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 3]

                     The news and nntp URI Schemes              May 2005

2.1.  The newsURI contains an <article>

   A <message-id> corresponds to the <msg-id> of [RFC 2822] and to the
   Message-ID of section 2.1.5 of [RFC 1036], but without the enclosing
   "<" and ">". It is intended to be the message identifier of an actual
   Netnews article and hence will in practice conform to the syntax
   defined in [RFC 1036] or in any subsequent standard for Netnews
   articles.

   Observe the delimiter "@" which enables an <article> to be
   distinguished from a <newsgroup-name>.

   The resource retrieved by this URI is the Netnews article with the
   given <message-id>.  Message identifiers are required to be globally
   unique, so the same article should be obtained whatever server is
   accessed for that purpose (provided the server in question has that
   article available).

2.2.  The newsURI contains a <collection>

   Any <newsgroup-name> contained in or implied by any <wildmat> is
   intended to be that of an existing newsgroup, such as
   "comp.lang.perl.modules", and hence will in practice conform to the
   syntax defined in [RFC 1036] or in any subsequent standard for
   Netnews articles.

   If the <wildmat> in the <collection> consists of just a single
   <newsgroup-name>, the resource retrieved by this URI is some means to
   gain access to the articles in the given <newsgroup-name> that are
   available from the given <authority> (usually by invoking a suitable
   news reading agent initialized to access that group).

   If the <wildmat> in the <collection> identifies a collection of
   newsgroups, the resource retrieved by this URI is some means to gain
   access to all of those newsgroups which are available from the given
   <authority> (usually by invoking a suitable news reading agent).

   If the <collection> contains no <wildmat> at all, the effect is the
   same as that of the <wildmat> "*", meaning "all available
   newsgroups".

3.  The nntp URI scheme

   The nntp URI scheme is used to retrieve individual articles via the
   NNTP protocol [NNTP].  It is usually (but not necessarily) used in
   connection with Netnews articles as defined in [RFC 1036].

   The nntp URI takes the form:

      nntpURI           = "nntp"  ":" news-server "/" newsgroup-name
                             "/" range
      news-server       =  "//" authority
      range             = article-number ["-" [article-number]]
      article-number    = 1*DIGIT

C. H. Lindsey                                                   [Page 4]

                     The news and nntp URI Schemes              May 2005

   Observe, in contradistinction to the news scheme, that the <news-
   server> is not optional here, because the mapping from <article-
   numbers> to actual articles is established independently by each
   server.

3.1.  The range is a single <article-number>

   The resource retrieved by this URI is the Netnews article numbered by
   the given <article-number> in the given <newsgroup-name> from the
   given <authority>.

3.2.  The range encompasses more than a single <article-number>

   The resource retrieved by this URI is some means to gain access to
   the articles numbered within the given <range> of <article-number>s
    in the given <newsgroup-name> from the given <authority> (usually by
   invoking a suitable news reading agent initialized to access that
   range). A <range> of the form "nnnn-" provides access to all articles
   numbered "nnnn" and above.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [RFC 3986].  The news protocol has hitherto used passwords in the
   clear for authentication, which is considered extremely unsafe in
   current practice (though [NNTP-AUTH] will eventually rectify that
   situation). Moreover it offers no privacy (though that is no drawback
   within the publicly distributed Usenet).
