Abstract

   The Fisheye State Routing (FSR) algorithm for ad hoc networks 
   introduces the notion of multi-level "scope" to reduce routing 
   update overhead in large networks.  A node stores the Link State 
   for every destination in the network.  It periodically broadcasts

   the Link State update of a destination to its neighbors with a 
   frequency that depends on the hop distance to that destination 
   (i.e., the "scope" relative to that destination).  State updates 
   corresponding to far away destinations are propagated with lower 
   frequency than those for close by destinations.  From state updates,
   nodes construct the topology map of the entire network and compute 
   efficient routes.  The route on which the packet travels becomes 
   progressively more accurate as the packet approaches its 
   destination.  FSR resembles Link State routing in that it propagates
   Link State updates.  However, the updates are propagated as 
   aggregates, periodically (with period dependent on distance) instead
   of being flooded individually from each source.  FSR leads to major 
   reduction in link O/H caused by routing table updates.  It enhances 
   scalability of large, mobile ad hoc networks.

1. Introduction              
                                        
   This document describes the Fisheye State Routing Protocol (FSR) 
   [1,2] developed by the Wireless Adaptive Mobility (WAM) 
   Laboratory [7] at University of California, Los Angeles.  Fisheye 
   State Routing is a table-driven routing protocol which is adapted 
   to the wireless ad hoc environment. It provides an implicit 
   hierarchical routing structure.  Through updating link state 
   information with different frequencies depending on the fisheye 
   scope distance, FSR scales well to large network size and keeps 
   overhead low without compromising route computation accuracy when 
   the destination is near.  The routing accuracy of FSR is comparable 
   with an ideal Link State scheme.  By retaining a routing entry for 
   each destination, FSR avoids the extra work of "finding" the 
   destination (as in on-demand routing) and thus maintains low single 
   packet transmission latency.  As mobility increases, routes to 
   remote destinations become less accurate.  However, when a packet 
   approaches its destination, it finds increasingly accurate routing 
   instructions as it enters sectors with a higher refresh rate.  As a 
   results, FSR is more desirable for large mobile networks where 
   mobility is high and the bandwidth is low.  By choosing proper 
   number of scope levels and radius size, FSR proves to be a flexible 
   solution to the challenge of maintaining accurate routes in ad hoc 
   networks.

   The following properties of FSR highlight its advantages.

   *   Simplicity

   *   Usage of up-to-date shortest routes

   *   Robustness to host mobility

   *   Exchange Partial Routing Update with neighbors

   *   Reduced Routing Update Traffic


2. Terminology                                                       

2.1. General Terms 

   This section defines terminology used in FSR.

   node

      A MANET router that implements this Fisheye State Routing
      protocol.

   neighbor

      Nodes that are within the radio transmission range.

   fisheye scope

      A zone that is bounded by hop distances.

2.2. Specification Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [8].


3. Protocol Applicability                 

3.1. Networking Context 

   FSR is best suited for large scale mobile ad hoc wireless networks, 
   as the scope update scheme has larger advantages in reducing routing
   update packet size and achieve high date packet to routing packet 
   ratio. Moreover, the fact that the route error is weighted by 
   distance obviously reduces the sensitivity to network size.

   FSR is also suited for high mobility ad hoc wireless networks.  This

   is because in a mobility environment, a change on a link far away 
   from the source does not necessarily cause a change in the routing 
   table at the source.

3.2. Protocol Characteristics and Mechanisms  

   * Does the protocol provide support for unidirectional links? 
     (if so, how?)
        Yes, since FSR is link state based routing protocol and 
        directional link states can be included in the FSR update 
        messages.

   * Does the protocol require the use of tunneling? (if so, how?)
        No.

   * Does the protocol require using some form of source routing? (if
     so, how?)

        No.  

   * Does the protocol require the use of periodic messaging? (if so,
     how?)

        Yes.  The FSR periodically exchanges partial link state 
        information with its neighbors 

   * Does the protocol require the use of reliable or sequenced packet
     delivery? (if so, how?)

        No.  As the packets are sent periodically, they need not be 
        sent reliably.

   * Does the protocol provide support for routing through a multi-
     technology routing fabric? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  It is assumed that each node's network interface is 
        assigned a unique IP address.

  
   * Does the protocol provide support for multiple hosts per router?
     (if so, how?)

        Yes.  The router that has multiple hosts can use network ID of 
        these hosts as the address to participate FSR.


   * Does the protocol support the IP addressing architecture? (if so,
   how?)



Pei, Gerla, Hong, and Chen                                     [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT     Fisheye State Routing Protocol     November 17, 2000


        Yes.  Each node is assumed to have a unique IP address (or
        set of unique IP addresses in the case of multiple interfaces).
        The FSR references all nodes/interfaces by their IP address.

        This version of the FSR also supports IP network addressing
        (network prefixes) for routers that provide access to a 
        network of non-router hosts.


   * Does the protocol require link or neighbor status sensing (if so,
   how?)

        No. 

   * Does the protocol have dependence on a central entity? (if so,
   how?)

        No.  


   * Does the protocol function reactively? (if so, how?)

        No.         

   * Does the protocol function proactively? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  The FSR proactively maintains routing information at each
        node.  

   * Does the protocol provide loop-free routing? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  As the protocol uses link state algorithm, so the 
        routing is loop-free in a stable state.  In mobile 
        environment, each link state entry is destination sequenced 
        which can prevent loop in routing.

   * Does the protocol provide for sleep period operation?(if so, how?)

        Yes. However, this requires TDMA MAC layer support. The router 
        can be scheduled to sleep during the idle period.

   * Does the protocol provide some form of security? (if so, how?)

        No. 

   * Does the protocol provide support for utilizing multi-channel,
     link-layer technologies? (if so, how?)

INTERNET-DRAFT     Fisheye State Routing Protocol     November 17, 2000



        Yes, in fact the multi-channel can be used to separate routing 
        messages from user data packets.


4. Protocol Overview    

   Fisheye State Routing is a table-driven or proactive routing 
   protocol.  It bases on link state protocol and has the ability of 
   immediately providing route information when needed. The fisheye 
   scope technique allows exchanging link state messages at different 
   intervals for nodes within different fisheye scope distance, which 
   reduces the link state message size.  Further optimization allows 
   FSR only broadcast topology message to neighbors [4] in order to 
   reduce the flood overhead.  With these optimizations, FSR 
   significantly reduces the topology exchange overhead and scales 
   well to large network size. 

   FSR routes each data packet according to locally computed routing 
   table.  The routing table uses most recent topology information.  
   The fisheye scope message updating scheme will not lose routing 
   accuracy for inner scope nodes.  For outer scope nodes, 
   information in routing entries may blur due to longer exchange 
   interval, but the extra work of "finding" the destination (as in 
   on-demand routing) is not necessary.  Thus low single packet 
   transmission latency can be maintained.  At a mobile environment, 
   this inaccuracy for remote nodes will increase.  However, when a 
   packet approaches its destination, it finds increasingly accurate 
   routing instructions as it enters sectors with a higher refresh rate.

   FSR doesn't trigger any control messages when a link failure is 
   reported.  Thus it is suitable for high topology change environment.
   The broken link will not be included in the next fisheye scope link 
   state message exchange.  Sequence number and table refreshment 
   enables the FSR to maintain the latest link state information and 
   loop-free in a unreliable propagation media and highly mobile 
   network.  
 
   The protocol works independently with the IP format of packets and 
   is a distributed protocol.  It can be implemented either in network 
   layer or in application layer. It only deals with routing table 
   management of the network system.


5. Fisheye Technique

   FSR uses the "fisheye" technique proposed by Kleinrock and 
   Stevens [3], where the technique was used to reduce the size of
 


Pei, Gerla, Hong, and Chen                                     [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT     Fisheye State Routing Protocol     November 17, 2000


   information required to represent graphical data.  The eye of a fish
   captures with high detail the pixels near the focal point.  
   The detail decreases as the distance from the focal point increases.
   In routing, the fisheye approach translates to maintaining accurate 
   distance and path quality information about the immediate 
   neighborhood of a node, with progressively less detail as the 
   distance increases.

5.1. Fisheye Scope 

   The fisheye scope is defined as the set of nodes that can be 
   reached within a given number of hops.  An example of a fisheye 
   scope (at node A) of hop 2 is shown below.

             +-----------------------------------------+
             |                       +---+             | +---+
             |            +---+   ---| F |-------|-------| H |
      +---+  |  +---+   --| C |--/   +---+     +---+   | +---+
      | G |-----| D |--/  +---+                | E |   |   
      +---+  |  +---+       |        +---+     +---+   |  
             |            +---+   ---| B |-------|     | 
             |            | A |--/   +---+             |
             |            +---+                        |
             +-----------------------------------------+
               Fisheye Scope at Node A of Hop 2
 
   Note that in this example node E can be reached through B from A 
   with 2 hops and through F with 3 hops. Since the minimum path 
   length is 2, E are within the fisheye scope of node A.  By setting
   multiple hop radius, multiple level of scopes will cover the 
   entire network. 

5.2. Fisheye State Routing Exchange Scheme
       
   FSR is functionally similar to Link State Routing (LS) in that 
   it maintains a topology map at each node.  The key difference is 
   the way in which routing information is disseminated.  In LS, the 
   update message could consume considerable amount of bandwidth, 
   which depends on the update period.  In order to reduce the 
   size of update messages without seriously affecting routing 
   accuracy, FSR uses the Fisheye technique. Entries in routing 
   table corresponding to nodes within the smallest scope are 
   propagated to the neighbors with the highest frequency.  The 
   rest of the entries are sent out with lower frequencies.  As a 
   result, a considerable fraction of link state entries is  
   suppressed in a typical update, thus reducing the message size. 
   Thus by using different exchange periods for different entries 
   in routing table, routing update overhead is reduced.



Pei, Gerla, Hong, and Chen                                     [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT     Fisheye State Routing Protocol     November 17, 2000



   This strategy produces timely updates from near stations, but 
   creates large latencies from stations afar.  However the imprecise
   knowledge of the best path to a distant destination is 
   compensated by the fact that the route becomes progressively more
   accurate as the packet gets closer to destination.  As the 
   network size grows large, a "graded" frequency update plan must 
   be used across multiple scopes to keep the overhead low.

   Link state packets are generated and flooded into the network 
   periodically or whenever a node detects a topology change.  
   In FSR, link state packets are not flooded.  Instead, they are 
   exchanged periodically with their local neighbors only.  A node 
   maintains a link state table based on the up-to-date information 
   received from neighboring nodes.  Sequence numbers are used for 
   entry replacements. The sequenced periodic table update resembles
   the vector exchange in Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector 
   Routing (DSDV [5]) where the distances are updated according to 
   the time stamp or sequence number assigned by the node 
   originating the update.  However, in FSR link states rather than 
   distance vectors are propagated.  Moreover, like in LS, a full 
   topology map is kept at each node and shortest paths are computed
   using this map.

   In a wireless environment, a radio link between mobile nodes may 
   experience frequent disconnects and reconnects.  The LS protocol 
   releases a link state update for each such change, which floods 
   the network and causes excessive overhead.  FSR avoids this 
   problem by using periodic, instead of event driven, exchange of 
   the topology map, greatly reducing the control message overhead.


6. Protocol Operation            

   This section discusses the operation of FSR routing protocol.  
   The sending and receiving of routing packets are in the proactive 
   nature.  And the routing packets are processed separately from 
   ordinary data packets. 
                          
6.1 Contents of Tables

   Each node running FSR is required to maintain following tables.  
   The required tables and suggested fields are listed below. 

6.1.1 Topology Table

   Topology table records the topology information obtained from the 
   link state message.  Each destination  has an entry in the table. 



Pei, Gerla, Hong, and Chen                                     [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT     Fisheye State Routing Protocol     November 17, 2000


   The entry contains two parts: the link state information, 
   a destination sequenced sequence number.  Based on this table, 
   the routing table is calculated.  The distance information is 
   obtained from routing table calculation and is used to classified 
   the node to a fisheye scope.  The topology table has following 
   fields for every link state entry:
   -  Destination Address
   -  Destination sequence number
   -  Link State List 

6.1.2 Neighbor Link State List

   When a node receives a link state message, it records/updates the 
   sender's link state information in its neighbor table.  If the node 
   does not receive link state updates from a neighbor for a 
   NEIGHBOR_TIMEOUT interval, the entry for that neighbor will be 
   deleted from the neighbor Link State List.  The following 
   information is maintained in the list for each neighbor node:
   -  Neighbor Node Link State List
   -  Latest timestamp of the received link state from the neighbor

6.1.3 Routing Table

   The routing table of FSR provides the next hop information to 
   forward the packets for the other destinations in the network. 
   The entries are updated when topology table is changed.  The 
   routing table has the following fields:
   -  Destination Address
   -  Next hop address
   -  Distance

   Initially when a FSR router is powered up, it knows nothing about 
   the network except routing information about all interfaces and 
   hosts that are directly attached to the router. 

6.2. Link State Message
 
   Periodically, nodes broadcast the topology tables to their 
   neighbors.  By listening to these broadcastings, each node builds 
   up its neighbor link list.  As the source address (the address 
   originating this message) and destination address(broadcast address 
   of the network) are already included in the IP header, the link 
   state message given here only contains packet size and topology 
   table entries.  

   The proposed format of a Link State Message (assume the link cost 
   is measured in hop distance and is 1 for each neighbor, therefore 
   the link cost is not included) is as follows.

   N_neighbors 1
      The number of neighbors of the first destination.

   Neighbor Address 1, ..., Neighbor Address N_neighbors 1
      The list of neighbors of the first destination.  The number is 
      indicated in the field N_neighbors 1.

   Destination Address 2
      The second destination address in the topology table.
   
   These fields are repeated for each entry in the topology table. 
   The length of link state message is limited to the maximum IP 
   packet size.  In that case, multiple packets may required to 
   broadcast all the topology entries.

6.3. Link State Message Processing

6.3.1 Originating Link State Message

   Each node broadcasts the latest link state information to its 
   neighbors.  FSR uses different update intervals for different 
   entries in the table according to their distance from the node. 
   To be precise, entries corresponding to nodes that are nearby 
   (within a predefined scope) are propagated to the neighbors more 
   frequently than entries of nodes that are far away.  When it is 
   the time for updating fisheye scope-i's topology information, 
   by scanning through the topology table, the nodes whose distance 
   to the current node is within the range of scope-i will be included
   in the update message.  The update interval of fisheye scope level i
   is UpdateInterval_i.  If the current node will be included in the 
   link state message, its sequence number is increased by one.

6.3.2 Receiving Link State Message

   When a node receives a link state message, it first checks its 
   neighbor link state list for the sender.  If the sender is a new 
   neighbor, it will insert the sender into the list.  Otherwise, 
   it will update the timestamp and link state information about 
   the sender in the list.  The node then processes the link state 
   information contained in the update message.  For each link state 
   entry in the packet, only the most up to date entry is copied to 
   the local topology table.  That is, if any entry in the incoming 
   message has a larger sequence number regarding to destination j 
   comparing with the ones stored in the node's local storage, the 
   local entry will be replaced by the incoming one.  After all 
   incoming entries are examined, if there are any changes in the 
   topology table, routing table is updated.

6.4 Link Breakage  

   In a mobile ad hoc network, link breakage is a frequent incident. 
   Each node uses soft state to detect link breakage, i.e., each node 
   will delete a neighbor from its link state list if it does not 
   receive link state messages from the neighbor after a 
   NEIGHBOR_TIMEOUT interval.

   FSR does not rely on feedback from MAC.  If MAC can provide 
   Feedback in case of link failure, FSR will use the report to update
   the neighbor table and provide more up-to-date routing information. 
   This faster discovery can result in a better performance. 

6.5. Routing Table Calculation  

   Whenever there are changes in the topology table, the routing table 
   will be updated.  Based on the latest topology table, the Dijkstra's
   algorithm [6] is performed to find the shortest paths from current 
   node for all the destinations known to it, i.e., in the topology 
   table.  Old routing table is replaced completely by the newly 
   computed next hop information.

   FindSP(i) is the algorithm used to create a shortest path tree 
   rooted at i.  In this documentation, the procedure is based on the 
   Dijkstra's algorithm with modifications so that the next hop 
   (denoted as table NEXTi()) and the distance (denoted as table Di()) 
   are computed in parallel with the tree reconstruction.

   At node i, FindSP(i) initiates with P = {i}, then it iterates until 
   P = V, where V is the set of all nodes.  In each iteration, 
   it searches for a node j such that node j minimizes the value of 
   (Di(k) + weight(k,j)), for all j and k, where j belongs to {V - P}, 
   k belongs to nodes in topology table and weight(k,j) does not equal 
   to infinite.  Once node j is found, P is augmented with j, D(j) is 
   assigned to D(k) + weight(k,j) and NEXTi(j) is assigned to NEXTi(k).
   That is, as the shortest path from i to j has to go through k, 
   the successor for i to j is the same successor for i to k.

   A weight function, weight(), is used to compute the distance of 
   a link.  Since minimum hop shortest path is considered in this 
   stage, this weight function simply returns 1 if two nodes have 
   direct connection, otherwise, it returns 0.  This weight function 
   may also be replaced with other functions for routing with different
   metrics.  For instance, a bandwidth function can be used to realize 
   a QoS routing.

7. Data Packet Forwarding

   As the routing table is calculated background, hop by hop data 
   packet forwarding is very straight forward.  The source node or 
   any intermediate nodes retrieve the destination from the data 
   packet, and look at their routing tables.  If the route is known, 
   i.e., there is an entry for the destination, the data packet is 
   sent to the next hop node.  This procedure repeats until the 
   packet finally reaches the destination. 


8. Considerations about Routing Inaccuracy

   FSR only has inaccurate routing information about remote nodes. 
   This inaccuracy is affected by the route update interval.  
   The longer the update interval, the less accurate the routing 
   information.  However, several features of FSR reduces the routing 
   inaccuracy.  For large network size, as the route error is weighted 
   by distance, the sensitivity to network size is largely reduced. 
   Thus, receiving updates about far away nodes at low frequency will 
   not significantly affect the routing accuracy.  The same mechanism 
   applies to mobility, i.e., the progressive accurating of the routing
   path reduces the impact from mobility. 

   Also, increasing the scope radius will improve the accuracy.  But 
   using larger radii will increase the routing update packets which 
   causes more control overhead.


9.  Configuration Parameters

   This section gives default values for some important parameters 
   associated with the FSR protocol operations.  Readers should take 
   these values as an example for the design of their own network 
   scenario.  Different values of these parameters may affect the 
   performance of the protocol.  The following values define a network 
   with two level fisheye scopes.  The inner scope is bounded by hop 
   distance 2.  Two different update frequencies are used for the 
   scopes, they are called IntraScope_Interval and InterScope_Interval 
   for inner and outer scope respectively. 

      Parameter Name                   Value
      -----------------------------    ----------------
      Number of Scope                  2
      IntraScope_Interval              5 second
      IntreScope_Interval              15 seconds
      NEIGHBOR_TIMEOUT                 15 seconds
