INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 14, 2014


1  Introduction

   [EVPN] introduces a solution for multipoint L2VPN services, with
   advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP control plane over the
   core MPLS/IP network. [VXLAN] defines a tunneling scheme to overlay
   Layer 2 networks on top of Layer 3 networks. [VXLAN] allows for
   optimal forwarding of Ethernet frames with support for multipathing
   of unicast and multicast traffic. VXLAN uses UDP/IP encapsulation for
   tunneling.

   In this document, we discuss how Ethernet VPN (EVPN) technology can
   be used to interconnect VXLAN or NVGRE networks over an MPLS/IP
   network. This is achieved by terminating the VxLAN tunnel at the
   hand-off points, performing data plane MAC learning of customer
   traffic and providing intra-subnet connectivity for the customers at
   Layer 2 across the MPLS/IP core. The solution maintains control-plane
   separation among the interconnected VXLAN or NVGRE networks. The
   scope of the learning of host MAC addresses in VXLAN or NVGRE network
   is limited to data plane learning in this document. The distribution
   of MAC addresses in control plane using BGP in VXLAN or NVGRE network
   is outside of the scope of this document and it is covered in [EVPN-
   OVERLY].

2. Requirements

2.1. Control Plane Separation among VXLAN/NVGRE Networks

   It is required to maintain control-plane separation for the underlay
   networks (e.g., among the various VXLAN/NVGRE networks) being
   interconnected over the MPLS/IP network. This ensures the following
   characteristics:

   - scalability of the IGP control plane in large deployments and fault
   domain localization, where link or node failures in one site do not

   trigger re-convergence in remote sites.

   - scalability of multicast trees as the number of interconnected
   networks scales.

2.2 All-Active Multi-homing

   It is important to allow for all-active multi-homing of the
   VXLAN/NVGRE network to MPLS/IP network where traffic from a VTEP can
   arrive at any of the PEs and can be forwarded accordingly over the
   MPLS/IP network. Furthermore, traffic destined to a VTEP can be
   received over the MPLS/IP network at any of the PEs connected to the
   VXLAN/NVGRE network and be forwarded accordingly.  The solution MUST
   support all-active multi-homing to an VXLAN/NVGRE network. 

2.3 Layer 2 Extension of VNIs/VSIDs over the MPLS/IP Network

   It is required to extend the VXLAN VNIs or NVGRE VSIDs over the
   MPLS/IP network to provide intra-subnet connectivity between the
   hosts (e.g. VMs) at Layer 2. 

2.4 Support for Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB)

   The data center WAN edge node is required to support integrated
   routing and bridging in order to accommodate both inter-subnet
   routing and intra-subnet bridging for a given VNI/VSID. For example,
   inter-subnet switching is required when a remote host connected to an
   enterprise IP-VPN site wants to access an application resided on a
   VM.  

3. Solution Overview

   Every VXLAN/NVGRE network, which is connected to the MPLS/IP core,
   runs an independent instance of the IGP control-plane. Each PE
   participates in the IGP control plane instance of its VXLAN/NVGRE
   network.

   Each PE node terminates the VXLAN or NVGRE data-plane encapsulation
   where each VNI or VSID is mapped to a bridge-domain. The PE performs
   data plane MAC learning on the traffic received from the VXLAN/NVGRE
   network.

   Each PE node implements EVPN or PBB-EVPN to distribute in BGP either
   the client MAC addresses learnt over the VXLAN tunnel in case of
   EVPN, or the PEs' B-MAC addresses in case of PBB-EVPN. In the PBB-
   EVPN case, client MAC addresses will continue to be learnt in data
   plane.

   Each PE node would encapsulate the Ethernet frames with MPLS when
   sending the packets over the MPLS core and with the VXLAN or NVGRE
   tunnel header when sending the packets over the VXLAN or NVGRE
   Network.

3.1.  Redundancy and All-Active Multi-homing

   When a VXLAN network is multi-homed to two or more PEs, and provided
   that these PEs have the same IGP distance to a given NVE, the
   solution MUST support load-balancing of traffic between the NVE and
   the MPLS network, among all the multi-homed PEs. This maximizes the
   use of the bisectional bandwidth of the VXLAN network. One of the
   main capabilities of EVPN/PBB-EVPN is the support for all-active
   multi-homing, where the known unicast traffic to/from a multi-homed
   site can be forwarded by any of the PEs attached to that site. This
   ensures optimal usage of multiple paths and load balancing. EVPN/PBB-
   EVPN, through its DF election and split-horizon filtering mechanisms,
   ensures that no packet duplication or forwarding loops result in such
   scenarios.  In this solution, the VXLAN network is treated as a
   multi-homed site for the purpose of EVPN operation.

   Since the context of this solution is VXLAN networks with data-plane
   learning paradigm, it is important for the multi-homing mechanism to
   ensure stability of the MAC forwarding tables at the NVEs, while
   supporting all-active forwarding at the PEs. For example, in Figure 1
   above, if each PE uses a distinct IP address for its VTEP tunnel,
   then for a given VNI, when an NVE learns a host's MAC address against
   the originating VTEP source address, its MAC forwarding table will

INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 14, 2014


   keep flip-flopping among the VTEP addresses of the local PEs. This is
   because a flow associated with the same host MAC address can arrive
   at any of the PE devices. In order to ensure that there is no
   flip/flopping of MAC-to-VTEP address associations, an IP Anycast
   address MUST be used as the VTEP address on all PEs multi-homed to a
   given VXLAN network. The use of IP Anycast address has two
   advantages:

   a) It prevents any flip/flopping in the forwarding tables for the
   MAC-to-VTEP associations

   b) It enables load-balancing via ECMP for DCI traffic among the
   multi-homed PEs     

   In the baseline [EVPN] draft, the all-active multi-homing is
   described for a multi-homed device (MHD) using [LACP] and the single-
   active multi-homing is described for a multi-homed network (MHN)
   using [802.1Q]. In this draft, the all-active multi-homing is
   described for a VXLAN MHN. This implies some changes to the filtering
   which will be described in details in the multicast section (Section
   4.6.2).

   The filtering used for BUM traffic of all-active multi-homing in
   [EVPN] is asymmetric; where the BUM traffic from the MPLS/IP network
   towards the multi-homed site is filtered on non-DF PE(s) and it
   passes thorough the DF PE. There is no filtering of BUM traffic
   originating from the multi-homed site because of the use of Ethernet
   Link Aggregation: the MHD hashes the BUM traffic to only a single
   link. However, in this solution because BUM traffic can arrive at
   both PEs in both core-to-site and site-to-core directions, the
   filtering needs to be symmetric just like the filtering of BUM
   traffic for single-active multi-homing (on a per service
   instance/VLAN basis).  

4.  EVPN Routes

   This solution leverages the same BGP Routes and Attributes defined in
   [EVPN], adapted as follows:

4.1.  BGP MAC Advertisement Route

   This route and its associated modes are used to distribute the
   customer MAC addresses learnt in data plane over the VXLAN tunnel in
   case of EVPN. Or can be used to distribute the provider Backbone MAC
   addresses in case of PBB-EVPN.

   In case of EVPN, the Ethernet Tag ID of this route is set to zero for
   VNI-based mode, where there is one-to-one mapping between a VNI and
 


Boutros                 Expires August 18, 2014                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 14, 2014


   an EVI. In such case, there is no need to carry the VNI in the MAC
   advertisement route because BD ID can be derived from the RT
   associated with this route. However, for VNI-aware bundle mode, where
   there is multiple VNIs can be mapped to the same EVI, the Ethernet
   Tag ID MUST be set to the VNI. At the receiving PE, the BD ID is
   derived from the combination of RT + VNI - e.g., the RT identifies
   the associated EVI on that PE and the VNI identifies the
   corresponding BD ID within that EVI.

   The Ethernet Tag field can be set to a normalized value that maps to
   the VNI, in VNI aware bundling services, this would make the VNI
   value of local significance in multiple Data centers. Data plane need
   to map to this normalized VNI value and have it on the IP VxLAN
   packets exchanged between the DCIs.

4.2.  Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route

   When EVPN is used, the application of this route is as specified in
   [EVPN]. However, when PBB-EVPN is used, there is no need for this
   route per [PBB-EVPN].

4.3.  Per VPN Route Targets

   VXLAN-EVPN uses the same set of route targets defined in [EVPN]. 

4.4  Inclusive Multicast Route

   The EVPN Inclusive Multicast route is used for auto-discovery of PE
   devices participating in the same tenant virtual network identified
   by a VNI over the MPLS network. It also enables the stitching of the
   IP multicast trees, which are local to each VXLAN site, with the
   Label Switched Multicast (LSM) trees of the MPLS network.

   The Inclusive Multicast Route is encoded as follow:

   - Ethernet Tag ID is set to zero for VNI-based mode and to VNI for
   VNI-aware bundle mode.

   - Originating Router's IP Address is set to one of the PE's IP
   addresses.

   All other fields are set as defined in [EVPN].

   Please see section 4.6  "Handling Multicast"

4.5.  Unicast Forwarding

   Host MAC addresses will be learnt in data plane from the VXLAN

   network and associated with the corresponding VTEP identified by the
   source IP address. Host MAC addresses will be learnt in control plane
   if EVPN is implemented over the MPLS/IP core, or in the data-plane if
   PBB-EVPN is implemented over the MPLS core. When Host MAC addressed
   are learned in data plane over MPLS/IP core [in case of PBB-EVPN],
   they are associated with their corresponding BMAC addresses.

   L2 Unicast traffic destined to the VXLAN network will be encapsulated
   with the IP/UDP header and the corresponding customer bridge VNI.

   L2 Unicast traffic destined to the MPLS/IP network will be
   encapsulated with the MPLS label.

4.6. Handling Multicast

   Each VXLAN network independently builds its P2MP or MP2MP shared
   multicast trees. A P2MP or MP2MP tree is built for one or more VNIs
   local to the VXLAN network. 

   In the MPLS/IP network, multiple options are available for the
   delivery of multicast traffic:      - Ingress replication      - LSM
   with Inclusive trees      - LSM with Aggregate Inclusive trees      -
   LSM with Selective trees      - LSM with Aggregate Selective trees

   When LSM is used, the trees are P2MP.

   The PE nodes are responsible for stitching the IP multicast trees, on
   the access side, to the ingress replication tunnels or LSM trees in
   the MPLS/IP core. The stitching must ensure that the following
   characteristics are maintained at all times:

   1. Avoiding Packet Duplication: In the case where the VXLAN network
   is multi-homed to multiple PE nodes, if all of the PE nodes forward
   the same multicast frame, then packet duplication would arise. This
   applies to both multicast traffic from site to core as well as from
   core to site.

   2. Avoiding Forwarding Loops: In the case of VXLAN network multi-
   homing, the solution must ensure that a multicast frame forwarded by
   a given PE to the MPLS core is not forwarded back by another PE (in
   the same VXLAN network) to the VXLAN network of origin. The same
   applies for traffic in the core to site direction.

   The following approach of per-VNI load balancing can guarantee proper
   stitching that meets the above requirements. 

4.6.2. Multicast Stitching with Per-VNI Load Balancing

   To setup multicast trees in the VXLAN network for DC applications,
   PIM Bidir can be of special interest because it reduces the amount of
   multicast state in the network significantly. Furthermore, it
   alleviates any special processing for RPF check since PIM Bidir
   doesn't require any RPF check. The RP for PIM Bidir can be any of the
   spine nodes. Multiple trees can be built (e.g., one tree rooted per
   spine node) for efficient load-balancing within the network. All PEs
   participating in the multi-homing of the VXLAN network join all the
   trees. Therefore, for a given tree, all PEs receive BUM traffic. DF
   election procedures of [EVPN] are used to ensure that only traffic
   to/from a single PE is forwarded, thus avoiding packet duplications
   and forwarding loops. For load-balancing of BUM traffic, when a PE or
   an NVE wants to send BUM traffic over the VXLAN network, it selects
   one of the trees based on its VNI and forwards all the traffic for
   that VNI on that tree.  PIM SM will be described in future revision
   of this draft.

   Multicast traffic from VXLAN/NVGRE is first subjected to filtering
   based on DF election procedures of [EVPN] using the VNI as the
   Ethernet Tag. This is similar to filtering in [EVPN] in principal;
   however, instead of VLAN ID, VNI is used for filtering, and instead
   of being 802.1Q frame, it is a VXLAN encapsulated packet. On the DF
   PE, where the multicast traffic is allowed to be forwarded, the VNI
   is used to select a bridge domain,. After the packet is de-
   capsulated, an L2 lookup is performed based on host MAC DA. It should
   be noted that the MAC learning is performed in data-plane for the
   traffic received from the VXLAN/NVGRE network and the host MAC SA is
   learnt against the source VTEP address.     

   The PE nodes, connected to a multi-homed VXLAN network, perform BGP
   DF election to decide which PE node is responsible for forwarding
   multicast traffic associated with a given VNI. A PE would forward
   multicast traffic for a given VNI only when it is the DF for this
   VNI. This forwarding rule applies in both the site-to-core as well as
   core-to-site directions. 

5. NVGRE

   Just like VXLAN, all the above specification would apply for NVGRE,

   Figure 2	VNI Base Service Packet Flow.

   VNI base Service(One VNI mapped to one EVI).

   Hosts H1, H2, H3 and H4 are hosts and there associated MAC addresses
   are M1, M2, M3 and M4. PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4 are the VXLAN-EVPN
   gateways. NVE1 and NVE2 are the originators of the VXLAN based
   network.

   When host H1 in Data Center Site1 communicates with H3 in Data Center
   Site2, H1 forms a layer2 packet with source IP address as IP1 and
   Source MAC M1, Destination IP as IP3 and Destination MAC as
   M3(assuming that ARP resolution already happened). VNE1 learns Source
   MAC and lookup in bridge domain for the Destination MAC. Based on the
   MAC lookup, the frame needs to be sent to VXLAN network. VXLAN
   encapsulation is added to the original Ethernet frame and frame is
   sent over the VXLAN tunnel. Frames arrives at PE1. PE1(i.e. VXLAN
   gateway), identifies that frame is a VXLAN frame. The VXLAN header is

   de-capsulated and Destination MAC lookup is done in the bridge domain
   table of the EVI. Lookup of destination MAC results in the EVPN
   unicast NH. This NH will be used for identifying the labels (tunnel
   label and service label) to be added over the EVPN core. Similar
   processing is done on the other side of DCI.  

6.1.2. VNI Bundle Service Use Case Scenario

   In the case of VNI-aware bundle service mode, there are multiple VNIs
   are mapped to one EVI. The Ethernet TAG ID must be set to the VNI ID
   in the EVPN BGP NLRIs. MPLS label allocation in this use case
   scenario can be done either per EVI or per EVI, VNI ID basis. If MPLS
   label allocation is done per EVI basis, then in data path there is a
   need to push a VLAN TAG for identifying bridge-domain at egress PE so
   that Destination MAC address lookup can be done on the bridge domain.

   There are two or more Data Center sites. These Data Center sites might use different VNI ID for same service. For example, Service A usage "VNI_ID_A" at data center site1 and "VNI_ID_B" for same service in data center site 2. 
   VNI ID A is terminated at ingress EVPN PE and VNI ID B is encapsulated at the egress EVPN PE.


6.2. Heterogeneous Network DCI Use Cases Scenarios

   Data Center sites are upgraded slowly; so heterogeneous network DCI solution is required from the perspective of migration approach from traditional data center to VXLAN based data center. For Example Data Center Site1 is upgrade to VXLAN but Data Center Site 2 and 3 are still layer2/VLAN based data centers. For these use cases, it is required to provide VXLAN VLAN interworking over EVPN core.  

6.2.1. VXLAN VLAN Interworking Over EVPN Use Case Scenario

   The new data center site is VXLAN based data center site. But the older data center sites are still based on the VLAN.

   Figure 5	  VXLAN VLAN interworking over EVPN Use Case

   If a service that are represented by VXLAN on one site of data center
   and via VLAN at different data center sites, then it is a recommended
   to model the service as a VNI base EVPN service. The BGP NLRIs will
   always advertise VLAN ID TAG as '0' in BGP routes. The advantage with
   this approach is that there is no requirement to do the VNI
   normalization at EVPN core. VNI ID A is terminated at ingress EVPN PE
   and "VLAN ID B" is encapsulated at the egress EVPN PE.
