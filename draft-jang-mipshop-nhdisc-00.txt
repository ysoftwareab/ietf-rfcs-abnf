1.  Introduction

   Internet's mobile nodes (MNs)are expected to discover and select
   their handover targets repeatedly.  Once the target is selected,
   generally a sequence of network authorization, attachment, and
   configuration steps are executed.  In some case, a subset of these
   steps may be pro-actively executed prior to the handover in order to
   expedite the post-handover process.

   In today's heterogeneous deployments mobile nodes and access networks
   present great variability in terms of the capabilities they need and
   present.  For example, a mobile node may require IPv6 access but not
   all networks in its neighborhood may support that.  A given access
   network may require IEEE 802.11i support that is not implemented by
   all nodes today.  Such potential mismatches necessitate a proper
   network discovery and selection process with the expectation that
   both the selected network and the mobile node will satisfy the needs
   of each other.

   A mobile node that has discovered a potential target network has two
   options to gather the information needed for the selection process.
   First possibility is that the mobile node is pre-configured with the
   identifier of the access network that maps to the network
   information.  Network, operator, or access point IDs present in
   beacons are possible identifiers to be used.  While this is the most
   common option used today, it has practical limitations due to its
   reliance on mobile node side configuration.  For example, when an
   operator's network has homogeneous capabilities across the
   deployment, simple mapping between the operator ID and the network
   capabilities is sufficient.  If there is heterogeneity (e.g., only
   some parts have migrated to IPv6), then the issue becomes harder.
   Second possibility is that the mobile node takes the "trial-and-
   error" approach to find an appropriate access network.  This is also
   not a practical approach due to the length of this process when there
   is more than few networks in one's neighborhood.

   Pro-active actions, such as pre-authorization, assume that the mobile
   node knows configuration information pertaining to the target
   network.  The configuration information is typically very specific to
   the target network (e.g., NAS IP address) and it cannot be easily
   pre-configured on the mobile nodes for all possible networks.

   Given the importance of target network information discovery and the
   practical limitations of the current solutions, a dynamic solution is
   proposed in this document.  The solution relies on using DHCP [1][2].
   While DHCP is commonly used for learning configuration information of
   the currently serving network, an implementation of this proposal
   allows a node learning configuration information about the

   neighboring networks.

   It is assumed that the DHCP server implementing this proposal is pre-
   configured with the information pertaining to the neighbor networks.
   Dynamic discovery mechanisms may be developed, but they are outside
   the scope of this document.  An access network may not know about all
   the others due to practical or business reasons.  This is a
   deployment consideration outside the scope of this protocol design.
   Location of the DHCP relays and servers does not change with the
   implementation of this proposal.

   Mobile node acting as the DHCP client can either request information
   about all of the neighbor networks or a specific one.  The former
   yields a list of networks and their associated configuration
   information.  The latter assumes the mobile node knows the ID of the
   specific network (e.g., learned from beacons).

2.  DHCP options for Mobile and Wireless Neighborhood Discovery

   This section introduces two DHCP options used for wireless and mobile
   neighbor discovery.

   For an MN to acquire the necessary configuration/capabilities
   information of adjacent networks, it requests to DHCP server by using
   new DHCP option, Neighborhood Request option.  An MN can either
   request neighbor information on all possible networks in neighborhood
   or on selected target networks by specifying one or more of the
   target networks.  In the latter case, the MN may identify the
   neighbor networks by their MAC addresses such as BSSID (Basic Service
   Set Identification) used by the access points or the base stations.
   Since the MAC addresses are readily available (e.g. via beacon) once
   the MN is in the coverage of the neighbor network, this identifier is
   the best suited one for rapid recognition.

   As a response to the Neighborhood Request option, the DHCP server
   retrieves the requested information from its database and replies
   with Neighborhood Reply option.  It is assumed that the DHCP server
   of the current network maintains a database of other networks in its
   neighborhood.

2.1.  Neighborhood Request Option

   This option is used to request neighborhood information to DHCP
   server.  This option may carry one or more parameters in the info-
   request field to identify the specific target networks and the
   requested parameters that the MN wants to get from the server.

             info-reply

                This field is the MIHF (Media Independent Handover
                Function) header. The specific format of this header is
                described in section 8.3.1 of IEEE 802.21 document [3].
                The SID (Service Identifier) value in the MIHF header
                shall be set to 4 (Information Service) and Opcode
                (Operation Code) set to 2 (Response).


   The info-request/reply fields include Information Elements (IEs)
   which take a format of TLV.  A complete list of such information has
   been defined in 802.21 [3] and the document categorizes the
   Information Elements into three groups; General IE, Access Network
   Specific IE, POA (Point of Attachment) Specific IE.

   General/Access Network Information elements give a general overview
   of the different networks providing coverage within an area such as
   list of available networks and their associated operators, roaming
   agreements between different operators, cost of connecting to the
   network and network security and quality of security capabilities.
   PoA elements provide information about different PoAs for each of the
   available access networks.  These IEs include PoA addressing
   information, PoA location, data rates supported, the type of PHY and
   MAC layers and any channel parameters to optimize link layer
   connectivity.  This may also include higher layer services and
   individual capabilities of different PoAs.  For the more detailed
   information about IE, the Section 6.3.2 of [3] could be refered.

3.  EEE 802.21 MIIS and Heterogeneous Neighborhood Information

   Media Independent Information Service (MIIS) defined in [3] enables
   the functionality across all available access networks by providing
   uniform way to retrieve heterogeneous network information in any
   geographical area.  An MN may get the heterogeneous neighborhood
   information by requesting Information Elements (IEs) from MIIS
   Server.  For example, by request and response for
   TYPE_IE_LIST_OF_NETWORKS, an MN may get the information on the types
   of neighboring networks such as IEEE 802.11, CDMA2000, UMTS, etc.
   The heterogeneous neighborhood information may also be delivered to
   the MN by using the pre-defined reports.  For example, the General
   Information Report provides the neighboring information about link
   type, number of operators for each link type, and a list of operator
   for each link type.

   The information provided by MIIS conforms to structure and semantics
   specified within 802.21.  The key components regarding MIIS in the
   IEEE 802.21 document are: Information Elements represented by using a
   standardized format such as XML or TLV; Primitives between MIH
   Function and MIH User for higher layers to get information from
   repository; and the frame format for exchanging messages between peer
   MIH function entities.  However, the transport of MIIS is out of the
   scope of IEEE 802.21.  This draft proposes using DHCP as the
   transport.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security concerns beyond
   those specified in the basic DHCP [1] and DHCPv6 [2] specifications.
   In the absence of message integrity protection for these options, an
   attacker could modify the option values.

5.  IANA Consideration

   This document introduces two new DHCP options, Neighborhood Request
   and Neighborhood Reply option.  The type numbers for these DHCP
   options are currently TBD.  An appropriate request will be made to
   IANA if this Internet draft gets accepted as an RFC.
