 An Identity-Based Key Management Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks 
                       draft-qin-cfrg-ibkm-wsn-00


Abstract

   This document specifies an efficient identity-based key management
   (IBKM) scheme in wireless sensor networks (WSNs),where the nodes are
   resource-limited, i.e., low computing capacity, small memory, power
   supply limitations and price,etc. This scheme exploits the Bloom
   filter to authenticate the communication sensor node with storage
   efficiency. The security analysis shows that IBKM can prevent several
   attacks effectively with acceptable computation and communication
   overhead.

1. Introduction

   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are ripe for wide adoption in several
   applications, such as military, healthcare, automotive, research, and
   so on. For applications such as military, higher requirements on WSN
   security is needed. However, WSN security is a challenging problem,
   because of the openness of WSNs' network architectures, which enables
   adversaries to easily eavesdrop, intercept, inject and alter
   transmitted information. Besides, the existing computer network
   security mechanisms cannot be directly adopted in WSNs because of the
   restricted node resources and low communication bandwidth. Therefore,
   it is urgent to put forward low consumption key management schemes
   for WSNs.

   Until now, key management schemes in WSNs were mainly based on
   symmetric cryptographic algorithms. For example, Eschenauer, L. etc.
   proposed probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes for pairwise key
   establishment [EG]. Their basic idea is that each node randomly picks
   a set of keys from a key pool before deployment, so that any two
   sensor nodes have a certain probability to share at least one common
   key.

   On the other hand, the key management schemes based on public key
   cryptography (PKC) could provide much simpler solutions with stronger
   security resilience. However, PKC requires more computing capacity,
   and for this reason, generally they were considered not applicable
   for energy-constrained WSNs. But recent works have demonstrated the
   feasibility of PKC on the resource-constrained sensor nodes.
   Specially, Oliveira et al. implemented pairings for sensor nodes
   based on the 8-bit/7.3828-MHz ATmega128L microcontroller (e.g., MICA
   2 and MICAz motes)[OLI], and they argued that pairing-based
   cryptography is indeed viable in resource-constrained nodes. Usually,
   PKC schemes are used for bootstrapping security in WSNs, i.e., for
   generating symmetric keys to communicate or key distribution. Kui et
   al. addressed the multiuser broadcast authentication problem in WSNs
   by designing PKC-based solutions [REN]. Their schemes are built upon
   the integration of several cryptographic techniques, including the
   Bloom filter, the Merkle hash tree, et al. However, they use the
   Bloom filter between the base station and the network user, where the
   network users refer to personnel or devices that use the WSN; they
   are not sensor nodes. In our scheme, the Bloom filter is used among
   the sensor nodes in WSN to provide an efficient authentication.

   But there are still several problems. For example, how does one
   verify the validness of a public key? Conventional solutions, such as
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  and certificate are non-
   implementable in WSNs, due to their constrained resource. How does
   one apply Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) [BF] in WSNs efficiently

INTERNET DRAFT                   <IBKM>               <January 29, 2015>


   and securely with the integrity of a public key? Public key validness
   is hard to be verified in present IBE schemes, because it usually
   depends on the certificate and CA. Additionally, the certificate will
   result in a large communication overhead and expensive signature
   verification operations, which consume more energy .

   Because of the absence of PKI and certificate in WSNs, there is no
   authentication in the state-of-the-art IBE schemes, which are subject
   to many attacks, such as the Sybil attack, the man-in-the-middle
   attack, etc. Focused on addressing these problems, we propose an
   efficient identity-based key management scheme (IBKM), which adopts
   an identity-based cryptosystem to distribute session keys between
   nodes without the complicated operations of the public key
   certificate; specifically, we exploit the Bloom filter to provide
   authentication with storage efficiency. A Bloom filter is a simple
   space-efficient randomized data structure based on a hash function
   for representing a set in order to support membership queries.
   Although Bloom filters allow false positives, for many applications,
   e.g., WSNs, the space savings outweigh this drawback when the
   probability of an error is sufficiently low.

      IBE Encryption: Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) is a Public-Key
   encryption technology that allows a Public Key to be calculated from

   the Public Key. Therefore, additional computations to verify the
   corresponding certificates are not needed.[RFC5091], [RFC5408], and
   [RFC5409] describe algorithms required to implement the IBE.

3. Network model

   Basically, there are two architectures for WSNs. One is a distributed
   flat architecture, and the other is a hierarchical architecture.
   Considering the limitations of WSNs, such as low energy supply,
   extremely large network size and redundant low-rate data, the
   hierarchical network model has more operational advantages than the
   flat homogeneous model for wireless sensors.

   In this work, we focus on the hierarchical network model. 

   There are three different kinds of nodes in our WSN; base station
   (BS), cluster head (CH) and sensor node (N). We assume that the BS is
   trusted and CH is more capable than normal nodes. In a cluster, the
   CH collects and aggregates packets from its member nodes and forwards
   them to the BS. Normally, a member sensor node can transfer packets
   to CH through several hops.


4. IBKM Scheme

4.1. Parameters Initialization Phase

   BS selects large prime p, q and generates a random elliptic curve E
   over finite field F(p). One point P on curve E is selected and used
   as generator to construct an additive group  G1, and e:G1*G1->F(p) is
   a bilinear map. H1 is a cryptographic hash function.

   1.BS selects a random number s and computes P_pub=s*P. BS broadcasts
   the public parameters.

INTERNET DRAFT                   <IBKM>               <January 29, 2015>


   2.BS generates each node's ID and calculates the public and private
   key pair of the node. Public key is PU_N=H1(ID_N),while private key
   is PR_N=s*PU_N. Then, BS preloads them into the node.

   3.BS generates the CH's ID and calculates the public and private key
   pair of the CH. Public key is PU_CH=H1(ID_CH),while private key is
   PR_CH=s*PU_CH. Then, BS stores them in the CH.

   4.BS keeps a list of all nodes' IDs and their public-private key
   pairs. BS also keeps all CHs' IDs and public keys for the next steps.

4.2. Node Registration Phase

   In this phase, all sensor nodes register to the cluster heads and a
   session key is generated between each node and their cluster head.

   1.CH broadcasts a message that contains its own identity ID_CH and
   public key PU_CH to all neighboring sensor nodes.

   CH->N: ID_CH,PU_CH

   2.Upon the receipt of CH's messages, each sensor node sends its ID
   and public key to the CH with whom it wants to join.

   Node->CH: ID_N, PU_N

   3.After receiving the ID and public key of a node, CH calculates the
   session key K_s1.

   K_s1=e(PR_CH, PU_N)

   4.Node calculates the session key K_s2.

   K_s2=e(PR_N,PU_CH)

   It can be proved that K_s1=K_s2,  which is given as follows:

   K_s1=e(PR_CH,
   PU_N)=e(s*PU_CH,PU_N)=e(s*PU_N,PU_CH)=e(PR_N,PU_CH)=K_s2

   5.CH generates a Bloom filter of all nodes' IDs and public keys
   within its cluster and sends the Bloom filter encrypted by the
   session key generated before to all nodes in the cluster. 

   CH->N:E(K_s1,Bloom filter)

4.3. Share Secret Key Generation between Two Nodes

   1.Sensor Node A chooses a random number r1 and broadcasts a message
   that contains its ID, public key and a time stamp encrypted by its
   own private key to neighboring nodes after it registers to the CH.

   A->Neighbor Nodes: ID_A,E(PR_A,(r1*PU_A,TS))

   2.When the neighboring Node B receives the message, it verifies the
   authenticity of A by checking if the hash mapping of (ID_A,PU_A) is
   contained in the Bloom filter obtained from CH. 

   A negative answer means authentication failure. If the authentication
   is passed, B chooses its random number r2 and returns its ID, public
   key and a time stamp encrypted by its own private key. Then, B
   calculates the session key K_B.

   B->A: ID_B,E(PR_B,(r2*PU_B,TS))

   K_B=e(r2*PR_B,r1*PU_A)

   3.A decrypts the message and get B's ID and public key. A verifies
   the authenticity of B using the Bloom filter obtained from CH. If B
   is authenticated, A calculates the session key K_A.

   K_A=e(r1*PR_A,r2*PU_B)

   It can also be proved that K_A=K_B using the properties of bilinear
   map.

   Afterwards, Nodes A and B can communicate with each other using the
   shared session key. 

5. Security Considerations

   Due to the unreliable wireless channel and volatile topology, a key
   agreement scheme for WSNs is subject to various attacks, such as
   node-compromise attack, Sybil attack, etc. Compared to previous
   works, our scheme can resist these attacks using the bilinear map and
   authentication through the Bloom filter.

   Sybil Attack: Before node deployment, the BS allocates an ID for each
   node in the WSNs, and then, the CH generates a Bloom filter of nodes
   in its own cluster. Therefore, before sharing the secret key between
   two nodes, they authenticate each other using the Bloom filter
   generated by CH. Therefore, IBKM can resist Sybil attack because an
   adversary cannot convince another node that it has a legal ID.

   Node-compromise attack: It is easy to capture a node in WSNs and
   steal secret information about the network stored in the node.

INTERNET DRAFT                   <IBKM>               <January 29, 2015>


   Compared to the EG and other key pre-distribution schemes, IBKM can
   resist node-compromise attack and ensure the security of the entire
   network. For the EG scheme and its variants, if the number of node
   adversaries captured exceeds a certain threshold, the adversaries
   will get almost all of the keys of the WSN. However, in our scheme,
   different node pairs share different keys; even if a node is
   compromised, it will not affect other node pairs' keys.

   Rekeying and forward secrecy: IBKM employs a random number r in the
   process of secret key generation between two nodes. On the one hand,
   we can stipulate the secret key agreement period; therefore, nodes
   must renegotiate a new session key in a certain period. In this way,
   we can enhance the security of the network. On the other hand, the
   rekeying can provide forward secrecy of the network when a node is
   captured by the adversary. Even if the adversary gets the current
   secret key, he cannot deduce the keys used before, because different
   random numbers generate different secret keys.

   HELLO flood attack: In this attack, the main aim of the attacker is
   to deplete the node energy. In our scheme, every node possesses a
   Bloom filter for node identity authentication. Therefore, if an
   adversary sends a HELLO message, the receiver nodes will firstly
   check if the message is legitimate or not. If the result is negative,
   later calculation will not be carried on. Therefore, no more energy
   of the received node will be consumed.

   Man-in-the-middle attack: In our scheme, the adversary cannot
   calculate the pairwise session key, even if he intercepts the system
   parameters, since the messages transmitted in our scheme are all
   encrypted in the public key cryptosystem. On the other hand, the
   session key is generated by the private key and the random number. It
   is assumed to be hard for an adversary to decrypt the message on air
   or to calculate the session key.

   Mutual authentication: Our scheme achieves both identity
   authentication and key authentication. Before the session key is
   agreed upon, the nodes verify the authenticity of each other by
   checking if the corresponding hash mapping is contained in the local
   Bloom filter. A negative answer means that the node is illegal in
   this cluster. Then, we verify the identity of the node by the
   signature of the private key. While, after, Node A and Node B share
   the same session key, they can realize identity authentication by the
   session key, because only A and B share the same key. In this way, we
   can prevent the unauthenticated node from accessing the sensor
   network.
