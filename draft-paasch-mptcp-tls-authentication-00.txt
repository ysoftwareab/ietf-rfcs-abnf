                      TLS Authentication for MPTCP
                draft-paasch-mptcp-tls-authentication-00

Abstract

   Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [4], is an extension to TCP to
   provide the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between
   peers.

   draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication specifies "application
   layer authentication" for Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated
   keying mechanism for MPTCP.  This allows keying material to be
   sourced from an application layer protocol in order to secure MP_JOIN
   handshakes.

   This document explains how to use the proposed application-layer
   authentication extension with TLS [6], in order to leverage securely
   exchanged keys for MPTCP security, whilst simultaneously freeing the
   MPTCP token to be used as a channel for additional information.

1.  Introduction

   As described in draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication, the
   use of "application-layer authentication" allows the Key used in
   MPTCP authentication to be provided by the application layer, thus
   permitting the use of existing secure communication channels for
   exchanging keying material.  Furthermore, this decouples the key from
   the token and thus allows the token to be used for conveying
   additional semantics, such as helping front-end proxies route traffic
   to appropriate back-end servers.

   TLS [6] provides a secure authentication channel between end hosts,
   where keys are not transmitted in the clear.  The protocol generates
   a master secret for a connection, and a method is described in [3]
   for exporting a key generated from this and other properties which
   can then be used by the application layer.  This document shows how
   to use this exported key, along with the method in draft-paasch-
   mptcp-application-authentication, for providing alternative keying
   mechanisms for MPTCP.

2.  Technical Implementation

   As described in draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication, the
   initial MP_CAPABLE handshake will exchange an arbitrary token for
   identifying an MPTCP connection.  Whilst it is RECOMMENDED that the
   token is hard to guess, it can be used to carry any data, such as
   arbitrary routing information, and the security provided by the
   application-layer security will mitigate any risks of an attacker
   guessing tokens.

   When an MPTCP end host wishes to open a new subflow, it will follow
   the same exchange as described in [4], however the keying material
   (Key-A and Key-B) will be derived from the TLS handshake, as
   described in [3].  The "label" field MUST be "EXPORTER-MPTCP".  The
   length used in the key-derivation, following [3] is 16.  Key-A are
   the 64 most-significant bits, while Key-B are the 64 remaining bits.
   This requires the key exchange to have completed before subflows can
   be created.  Other than the source of the keys, the exchange remains
   the same.  The MP_CAPABLE and MP_JOIN exchange therefore looks like
   this:

              Host A                                  Host B
     ------------------------                       ----------
     Address A1    Address A2                       Address B1
     ----------    ----------                       ----------
         |             |                                |
         |             |  SYN + MP_CAPABLE              |
         |--------------------------------------------->|
         |<---------------------------------------------|
         |         SYN/ACK + MP_CAPABLE(Token-B)        |
         |             |                                |
         |      ACK + MP_CAPABLE(Token-A, Token-B)      |
         |--------------------------------------------->|
         |             |                                |
         |             |   SYN + MP_JOIN(Token-B, R-A)  |
         |             |------------------------------->|
         |             |<-------------------------------|
         |             | SYN/ACK + MP_JOIN(HMAC-B, R-B) |
         |             |                                |
         |             |     ACK + MP_JOIN(HMAC-A)      |
         |             |------------------------------->|
         |             |<-------------------------------|
         |             |             ACK                |

   HMAC-A = HMAC(Key=(Key-A+Key-B), Msg=(R-A+R-B))
   HMAC-B = HMAC(Key=(Key-B+Key-A), Msg=(R-B+R-A))

3.  Security Considerations

   This draft relies on the security provided by TLS [6] and the key
   export mechanism of [3] to provide additional security for the MPTCP
   handshake mechanism.  These changes remove lingering risks,
   originally identified in [7], where an intercept of the initial MPTCP
   handshake could allow session hijack.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA would be requested to add a value to the TLS Exporter Label
   registry as described in [3].  The label is "EXPORTER-MPTCP".
