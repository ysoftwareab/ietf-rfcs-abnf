1. Introduction

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAPTS] (LDAP) is an
  extensible protocol.  LDAP supports:
    - addition of new operations,
    - extension of existing operations, and
    - extensible schema.

  This document details procedures for registering values of used to
  unambiguously identify extensible elements of the protocol including:
    - LDAP message types,
    - LDAP result codes,
    - LDAP authentication methods,
    - LDAP attribute description options, and
    - Object Identifier descriptors.

  These registries are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers
  Authority (IANA).

  In addition, this document provides guidelines to IANA describing the
  conditions under which new values can be assigned.


2. Terminology and Conventions

  This section details terms and conventions used in this document.


2.1. Policy Terminology

  The terms "IESG Approval", "Standards Action", "IETF Consensus",
  "Specification Required", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review",
  and "Private Use" are used as defined in BCP 26 [RFC2434].


2.2. Requirement Terminology

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].  In
  this case, "the specification" as used by BCP 14 refers to the
  processing of protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.


2.3. Common ABNF Productions

  A number of syntaxes in this document are described using ABNF
  [RFC2234].  These syntaxes rely on the following common productions:

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-08.txt         29 July 2002


       ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A    ; A-Z / a-z

       LDIGIT = %x31-39             ; 1-9

       DIGIT = %x30 / LDIGIT        ; 0-9

       HYPHEN = %x2D                ; "-"

       DOT = %x2E                   ; "."

       number = DIGIT / ( LDIGIT 1*DIGIT )

       keychar = ALPHA / DIGIT / HYPHEN

       leadkeychar = ALPHA

       keystring = leadkeychar *keychar

  A keyword is a case-insensitive string of UTF-8 [RFC2279] encoded
  characters from the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646]
  restricted to the <keystring> production.


3.  IANA Considerations for LDAP

  This section details each kind of protocol value which can be
  registered and provides IANA guidelines on how to assign new values.


3.1. Object Identifiers

  Numerous LDAP schema and protocol elements are identified by Object
  Identifiers.  Specifications which assign OIDs to elements SHOULD
  state who delegated the OIDs for its use.

  For IETF developed elements, specifications SHOULD use OIDs under
  "Internet Directory Numbers" (1.3.6.1.1.x).  Numbers under this OID
  arc will be assigned upon Expert Review with Specification Required.
  Only one OID per specification will be assigned.  The specification
  MAY then assign any number of OIDs within this arc without further
  coordination with IANA.

  For elements developed by others, any properly delegated OID can be
  used, including those under "Internet Private Enterprise Numbers"
  (1.3.6.1.4.1.x) assigned by IANA
  <http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl>.

  To avoid interoperability problems between early implementions of

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-08.txt         29 July 2002


  ''works in progress'' and implementions of the published specification
  (e.g., the RFC), experimental OIDs SHOULD be used in ''works in
  progress'' and early implementations.  OIDs under the Internet
  Experimental OID arc (1.3.6.1.3.x) may be used for this purpose.

  Experimental OIDs are not to used in published specifications (e.g.
  RFCs).

  Practices for IANA assignment of Internet Enterprise and Experimental
  OIDs are detailed in STD 16 [RFC1155].


3.2. Object Identifier Descriptors

  LDAP allows short descriptive names (or descriptors) to be used
  instead of a numeric Object Identifier to identify protocol extensions
  [RFC2251], schema elements [RFC2252], LDAP URL [RFC2255] extensions,
  and other objects.  Descriptors are restricted to strings of UTF-8
  encoded UCS characters restricted by the following ABNF:

       name = keystring

  Descriptors are case-insensitive.

  Multiple names may be assigned to a given OID.  For purposes of
  registration, an OID is to be represented in numeric OID form
  conforming to the ABNF:

       numericoid = number *( DOT number ) ; e.g. 1.1.0.23.40

  While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon
  descriptors, they should be short.  Descriptors longer than 48
  characters may be viewed as too long to register.  IANA may reject
  obviously bogus registrations.

  A values ending with a hyphen ("-") reserve all descriptors which
  start with the value.  For example, the registration of the option
  "descrFamily-" reserves all options which start with "descrFamily-"
  for some related purpose.

  Descriptors beginning with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be
  registered.

  Descriptors beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments and will
  be registered on a First Come First Served basis.

  All other descriptors require Expert Review to be registered.

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-08.txt         29 July 2002


  The registrant need not "own" the OID being named.

  The OID namespace is managed by The ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee
  1 - Subcommittee 6.


3.3. AttributeDescription Options

  An AttributeDescription [RFC2251, Section 4.1.5] can contain zero or
  more options specifying additional semantics.  An option SHALL be
  restricted to a string UTF-8 encoded UCS characters limited by the
  following ABNF:

       option = keystring

  Options are case-insensitive.

  While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon option
  strings, they should be short.  Options longer than 24 characters may
  be viewed as too long to register.  IANA may reject obviously bogus
  registrations.

  Values ending with a hyphen ("-") reserve all option names which start
  with the name.  For example, the registration of the option
  "optionFamily-" reserves all options which start with "optionFamily-"
  for some related purpose.

  Options beginning with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be
  registered.

  Options beginning with "e-" are reserved for experiments and will be
  registered on a First Come First Served basis.

  All other options require Standards Action or Expert Review with
  Specification Required to be registered.


3.4. LDAP Message Types

  Each protocol message is encapsulated in an LDAPMessage envelope
  [RFC2251, Section 4.1.1].  The protocolOp CHOICE indicates the type of
  message encapsulated.  Each message type consists of a keyword and a
  non-negative choice number is combined with the class (APPLICATION)
  and data type (CONSTRUCTED or PRIMITIVE) to construct the BER tag in
  the message's encoding.  The choice numbers for existing protocol
  messages are implicit in the protocol's ASN.1 defined in [RFC2251].

  New values will be registered upon Standards Action.

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-08.txt         29 July 2002


  Note: LDAP provides extensible messages which reduces, but does not
        eliminate, the need to add new message types.


3.5. LDAP Result Codes

  LDAP result messages carry an resultCode enumerated value to indicate
  the outcome of the operation [RFC2251, Section 4.1.10].  Each result
  code consists of a keyword and a non-negative integer.

  New resultCodes integers in the range 0-1023 require Standards Action
  to be registered.  New resultCode integers in the range 1024-4095
  require Expert Review with Specification Required.  New resultCode
  integers in the range 4096-16383 will be registered on a First Come
  First Served basis.  Keywords associated with integers in the range
  0-4095 SHALL NOT start with "e-" or "x-".  Keywords associated with
  integers in the range 4096-16383 SHALL start with "e-".  Values
  greater than or equal to 16384 and keywords starting with "x-" are for
  Private Use and cannot be registered.

  IANA may reject obviously bogus registrations.


3.6. LDAP Authentication Method

  The LDAP Bind operation supports multiple authentication methods
  [RFC2251, Section 4.2].  Each authentication choice consists of a
  keyword and a non-negative integer.

  The registrant SHALL classify the authentication method usage using
  one of the following terms:

    COMMON      - method is appropriate for common use on the Internet,
    LIMITED USE - method is appropriate for limited use,
    OBSOLETE    - method has been deprecated or otherwise found to be
                  inappropriate for any use.

  Methods without publicly available specifications SHALL NOT be
  classified as COMMON.  New registrations of class OBSOLETE cannot be
  registered.  IANA may reject obviously bogus registrations.

  New authentication method integers in the range 0-1023 require
  Standards Action to be registered.  New authentication method integers
  in the range 1024-4095 require Expert Review with Specification
  Required.  New authenticaiton method integers in the range 4096-16383
  will be registered on a First Come First Served basis.  Keywords
  associated with integers in the range 0-4095 SHALL NOT start with "e-"
  or "x-".  Keywords associated with integers in the range 4096-16383



Zeilenga              IANA Considerations for LDAP              [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-08.txt         29 July 2002


  SHALL start with "e-".  Values greater than or equal to 16384 and
  keywords starting with "x-" are for Private Use and cannot be
  registered.

  Note: LDAP supports SASL [RFC2222] as an Authentication CHOICE.  SASL
        is an extensible LDAP authentication method.


3.7. Directory Systems Names

  The IANA-maintained "Directory Systems Names" registry [IANADSN] of
  valid keywords for well known attributes used in the LDAPv2 string
  representation of a distinguished name [RFC1779].  RFC 1779 was
  obsoleted by RFC 2253.

  Directory systems names are not known to be used in any other context.
  LDAPv3 uses Object Identifier Descriptors [Section 3.2] (which have a
  different syntax than directory system names).

  New Directory System Names will no longer be accepted.  For historical
  purposes, the current list of registered names should remain
  publically available.


4. Registration Procedure

  The procedure given here MUST be used by anyone who wishes to use a
  new value of a type described in Section 3 of this document.

  The first step is for the requester to fill out the appropriate form.
  Templates are provided in Appendix A.

  If the policy is Standards Action, the completed form SHOULD be
  provided to the IESG with the request for Standards Action.  Upon
  approval of the Standards Action, the IESG SHALL forward the request
  (possibly revised) to IANA.  The IESG SHALL be viewed as the owner of
  all values requiring Standards Action.

  If the policy is Expert Review, the requester SHALL post the completed
  form to the <directory@apps.ietf.org> mailing list for public review.
  The review period is two (2) weeks.  If a revised form is later
  submitted, the review period is restarted.  Anyone may subscribe to
  this list by sending a request to <directory-request@apps.ietf.org>.
  During the review, objections may be raised by anyone (including the
  Expert) on the list.  After completion of the review, the Expert,
  based upon public comments, SHALL either approve the request and
  forward it to the IESG OR deny the request.  In either case, the
  Expert SHALL promptly notify the requester of the action.  Actions of



Zeilenga              IANA Considerations for LDAP              [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ldapbis-iana-08.txt         29 July 2002


  the Expert may be appealed [RFC2026].  The Expert is appointed by
  Applications Area Director(s).  The requester is viewed as the owner
  of values registered under Expert Review.

  If the policy is First Come First Served, the requester SHALL submit
  the completed form directly to the IANA <iana@iana.org>.  The
  requester is viewed as the owner of values registered under First Come
  First Served.

  Neither the Expert nor IANA will take position on the claims of
  copyright or trademarks issues regarding completed forms.

  Prior to submission of the Internet Draft (I-D) to the RFC Editor but
  after IESG review and tentative approval, the document editor SHOULD
  revise the I-D to use registered values.


5. Registration Maintenance

  This section discusses maintenance of registrations.


5.1. Lists of Registered Values

  IANA makes lists of registered values readily available to the
  Internet community on their web site <http://www.iana.org/>.


5.2. Change Control

  The registration owner MAY update the registration subject to the same
  constraints and review as with new registrations.  In cases where the
  owner is not unable or unwilling to make necessary updates, the IESG
  MAY assert ownership in order to update the registration.


5.3. Comments

  For cases where others (anyone other than the owner) have significant
  objections to the claims in a registration and the owner does not
  agree to change the registration, comments MAY be attached to a
  registration upon Expert Review.  For registrations owned by the IESG,
  the objections SHOULD be addressed by initiating a request for Expert
  Review.

  The request form to these requests is ad hoc, but MUST include the
  specific objections to be reviewed and SHOULD contain (directly or by
  reference) materials supporting the objections.

6. Security Considerations

  The security considerations detailed in [RFC2434] are generally
  applicable to this document.  Additional security considerations
  specific to each namespace are discussed in Section 3 where
  appropriate.

  Security considerations for LDAP are discussed in documents comprising
  the technical specification [LDAPTS].
