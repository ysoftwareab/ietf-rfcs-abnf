Abstract

   This document summarizes the history of HTML development, and
   defines the "text/html" MIME type by pointing to the relevant W3C
   recommendations, It is intended to obsolete the previous IETF
   documents defining HTML, including RFC 1866, RFC 1867, RFC 1980,
   RFC 1942 and RFC 2070.

   This document was prepared at the request of the W3C HTML working
   group. Please send comments to www-html@w3.org, a public mailing
   list with archive at
   <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/>.

1. Introduction and background

   The text/html media type was originally defined in [HTML20] in Nov
   1995. Extensions to HTML were proposed in [HTML30], [UPLOAD],
   [TABLES], [CLIMAPS], and [I18N].

   The IETF HTML working group closed Sep 1996, and work on HTML moved
   to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The proposed extensions
   were incorporated, to some extent, in [HTML32], and to a larger
   extent, in [HTML40]. The definition of multipart/form-data from
   [UPLOAD] was described in [FORMDATA]. In addition, a reformulation
   of HTML 4.0 in XML 1.0 is being developed [XHTML1].

   [HTML32] notes "This specification defines HTML version 3.2. HTML
   3.2 aims to capture recommended practice as of early '96 and as
   such to be used as a replacement for HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866)."
   Subsequent specifications for HTML describe the differences
   in each version.

2. Definition for 'text/html'

   The 'text/html' media type is now defined by W3C recommendations;
   the latest published version is [HTML40]. As of this writing, a
   revision, HTML 4.01 [HTML401], is being developed. In both [HTML40]
   and [HTML401].

   The "text/html" media type may be used to refer to any W3C
   published version of HTML; the versions are distinguishable by the
   "DOCTYPE" declaration contained within them. In addition, [XHTML1]
   defines an profile of use of XHTML which is compatible with HTML
   4.0, and which may also be served as 'text/html'.

   MIME media type name:      text
   MIME subtype name:         html
   Required parameters:       none
   Optional parameters:       charset

     The optional parameter "charset" refers to the character encoding
     used to represent the HTML document as a sequence of bytes. Any
     registered IANA charset may be used, but UTF-8 is preferred.
     Although this parameter is optional, it is recommended that it
     always be present.

  Encoding considerations:

     Because of the availability within HTML itself for using
     character entity references for non-ASCII characters, it is
     possible that text/html documents with a wide repertoire may be
     transported without encoding. Otherwise, transport of text/html
     using charsets other than US-ASCII may require base64 or
     quoted-printable encoding for 7-bit channels.

  Security considerations:

     See section 3 of this document.

   Additional information:

     Magic number:

       There is no single initial string that is always present for
       HTML files.

       Almost all HTML files have the string "<html" or "<HTML" near
       the beginning of the file.

       Documents conformant to HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0 will
       start with a DOCTYPE declaration "<!DOCTYPE HTML" near the
       beginning, before the "<html". These dialects are case
       insensitive.  Files may start with white space, comments
       (introduced by "<!--" ), or processing instructions (introduced
       by "<?") prior to the DOCTYPE declaration.

       XHTML documents (optionally) start with an XML declaration
       which begins with "<?xml" and are required to have a DOCTYPE
       declaration "<!DOCTYPE html".

     File extension:

       The file extensions 'htm' or 'html' are commonly used, but
       other extensions denoting file formats for preprocessing are
       also common.

     Macintosh File Type code: HTML

3. Security Considerations

   [HTML40], section B.10, notes various security issues with
   interpreting anchors and forms in HTML documents.

   In addition, the introduction of scripting languages and
   interactive capabilities in HTML 4.0 introduced a number of
   security risks associated with the automatic execution of programs
   written by the sender but interpreted by the recipient.  User
   agents executing such scripts or programs must be extremely careful
   to insure that untrusted software is executed in a protected
   environment.
