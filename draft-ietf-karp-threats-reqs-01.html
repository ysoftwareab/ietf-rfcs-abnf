<h1><br />The Threat Analysis and
    Requirements for Cryptographic Authentication of Routing Protocols'
    Transports<br />draft-ietf-karp-threats-reqs-01</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own mechanism
     for securing the protocol packets on the wire. While most already have some 
     method for accomplishing cryptographic message
      authentication, in many cases the existing methods are dated,
      vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic algorithms that have
      been deprecated. The "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols"
      (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>This  document has two main parts - the first describes the threat analysis for
      attacks against routing protocols' transports and the second enumerates the
      requirements for addressing the described threats. This document, along
      with the KARP design guide and KARP framework documents, will be used by
      KARP design teams for specific protocol review and overhaul. This
      document reflects the input of both the IETF's Security Area and Routing
      Area in order to form a jointly agreed upon guidance.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>In March 2006 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop
      on the topic of "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that
      workshop is documented in RFC 4948 <a class='info' href='#RFC4948'>[RFC4948]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Davies, E., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Report from the IAB workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      Section 8.1 of that document states "A simple risk analysis would
      suggest that an ideal attack target of minimal cost but maximal
      disruption is the core routing infrastructure." Section 8.2 calls for
      "[t]ightening the security of the core routing infrastructure." Four
      main steps were identified for that tightening:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>More secure mechanisms and practices for operating routers. This
          work is being addressed in the OPSEC Working Group.
</li>
<li>Cleaning up the Internet Routing Registry repository [IRR], and
          securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
          for routing verifications. This work should be addressed through
          liaisons with those running the IRR's globally.
</li>
<li>Specifications for cryptographic validation of routing message
          content. This work will likely be addressed in the SIDR Working
          Group.
</li>
<li>Securing the routing protocols' packets on the wire
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document addresses the last item in the list above, securing the 
	the transmission of routing protocol packets on the wire, or rather
	securing routing protocol transport.
	This effort is referred to as Keying and Authentication for
      Routing Protocols, or "KARP". This document specifically addresses the
      threat analysis for per packet routing protocol transport
      authentication, and the requirements for protocols to mitigate those
      threats.
</p>
<p>This document is one of three that together form the guidance and
      instructions for KARP design teams working to overhaul routing protocol
      transport security. The other two are the KARP Design Guide <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;karp&#8209;design&#8209;guide]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lebovitz, G. and M. Bhatia, &ldquo;Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> and the KARP Framework <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-karp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;karp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atwood, W. and G.

Terminology</h3>

<p>Within the scope of this document, the following words, when
        beginning with a capital letter, or spelled in all capitals, hold the
        meanings described to the right of each term. If the same word is used
        uncapitalized, then it is intended to have its common english
        definition.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>PSK (Pre-Shared Key) 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> A key used by both peers in a secure
        configuration. Usually exchanged out-of-band prior to a first
        connection.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Routing Protocol 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>When used with capital "R" and "P" in this
        document the term refers the Routing Protocol for which work is being
        done to provide or enhance its peer authentication mechanisms.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> PRF 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>In cryptography, a pseudorandom function family, abbreviated 
            PRF, is a collection of efficiently-computable functions which emulate a 
            random oracle in the following way: No efficient algorithm can distinguish
           (with significant advantage) between a function chosen randomly from the 
           PRF family and a random oracle (a function whose outputs are fixed 
          completely at random). Informally, a PRF takes a secret key and a set of input 
          values and produces random-seeming output values for each input value.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>KDF (Key derivation function)
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> A KDF is a function in which an input key and other input data is used to generate 
			(or derive) keying material that can be employed by cryptographic algorithms. 
			The key that is input to a KDF is called a key derivation key. KDFs 
		   can be used to generate one or more keys from either (i) a uniformly random 
			or pseudorandom seed value or (ii) a Diffie-Hellman shared secret or (iii) a 
			non-uniform random source or (iv) a passphrase.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Identifier 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The type and value used by one peer of an authenticated
        message exchange to signify to the other peer who they are. The
        Identifier is used by the receiver as a lookup index into a table
        containing further information about the peer that is required to
        continue processing the message, for example a Security Association
        (SA) or keys.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Identity Proof 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Once the form of identity is decided, then
           there must be a cryptographic proof of that identity, that
           the peer really is who they assert themselves to be.  Proof
           of identity can be arranged between the peers in a few ways,
           for example pre-shared keys, raw assymetric keys, or a more
           user-friendly representation of assymetric keys, such as a
           certificate.  Certificates can be used in a way requiring no
           additional supporting systems -- e.g. public keys for each
           peer can be maintained locally for verification upon contact.
           Certificate management can be made more simple and scalable
           with the use of minor additional supporting systems, as is
           the case with self-signed certificates and a flat file list
           of "approved thumbprints".  Self-signed certificates will
           have somewhat lower security properties than Certificate
           Authority signed certificates .  The use of these
           different identity proofs vary in ease of deployment, ease of
           ongoing management, startup effort, ongoing effort and
           management, security strength, and consequences from loss of
           secrets from one part of the system to the rest of the
           system.  For example, they differ in resistance to a security
           breach, and the effort required to remediate the whole system
           in the event of such a breach.  The point here is that there
           are options, many of which are quite simple to employ and
           deploy.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>SA (Security Association) 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> The parameters and keys that together
        form the required information for processing secure sessions between
        peers. Examples of items that may exist in an SA include: Identifier,
        PSK, Traffic Key, cryptographic algorithms, key lifetimes.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>KMP (Key Management Protocol) 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>A protocol used between peers for creation, distribution and maintenance of 
			secret keys. It determines how secret keys are generated and made available 
			to both the parties. If session or traffic keys are being used, KMP is responsible for 
			generating them and determining when they should be renewed. 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
			A KMP is helpful because it negotiates unique, pair wise, random keys without administrator 
			involvement.  It also negotiates as mentioned earlier several of the SA parameters required 
			for the secure connection, including key life times.  It keeps track of those lifetimes using counters, 
			and negotiates new keys and parameters before they expire, again, without administrator interaction.
			Additionally, in the event of a breach, changing the KMP key will immediately cause a rekey to occur for the
			 Traffic Key, and those new Traffic Keys will be installed and used in the current connection.

</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>KMP Function 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Any actual KMP used in the general KARP solution
        framework
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Peer Key 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Keys that are used between peers as the identity proof.
        These keys may or may not be connection specific, depending on how
        they were established, and what form of identity and identity proof is
        being used in the system. This would generally be given by the KMP that
        would later be used to derive fresh traffic keys.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Traffic Key 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The actual key (or set of keys) used for protecting the routing protocol traffic.
			Since the traffic keys used in a particular connection are not a fixed part of a 
			device configuration no data exists anywhere else in the operator's systems 
			which can be stolen, e.g. in the case of a terminated or turned employee. If a server or other data 
			store is stolen or compromised, the thieves gain no access to current traffic keys. They may gain 
			access to key derivation material, like a PSK, but not current traffic keys in use.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Scope</h3>

<p>Three basic services (or techniques) may be employed in order to secure any piece of
        data as it is transmitted over the wire: privacy,
        authentication, and message integrity. The focus for
        this effort, and the scope for this roadmap document, will be message
        authentication and packet integrity only. This work explicitly
        excludes, at this point in time, privacy services. 
        Non-repudiation is also excluded as a goal at this time.
        Since the objective of most routing protocols is to
        broadly advertise the routing topology, routing messages are commonly
        sent in the clear; confidentiality is not normally required for
        routing protocols. However, ensuring that routing peers truly are the
        trusted peers expected, and that no rogue peers or messages can
        compromise the stability of the routing environment is critical, and
        thus our focus. Privacy and
        non-repudiation may be addressed in future work.
</p>
<p>OSPF, IS-IS, LDP, and RIP already have existing mechanisms for cryptographically
        authenticating and integrity checking the packets on the wire.
        Products with these mechanisms have already been produced, code has
        already been written and both have been optimized for the existing
        mechanisms. Rather than turn away from these mechanisms, this document aims to
        enhance them, updating them to modern and secure levels.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the scope of this roadmap of work includes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Making use of existing routing protocol transport security mechanisms,
            where they exist, and enhancing or updating them as necessary for
            modern cryptographic best practices
</li>
<li>Developing a framework for using automatic key management in
            order to ease deployment, lower cost of operation, and allow for
            rapid responses to security breaches
</li>
<li>Specifying the automated key management protocol that may be
            combined with the bits-on-the-wire mechanisms.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document does not contain protocol specifications. Instead, it
        defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed and sets
        a direction, a set of requirements, and a relative priority for
        addressing that specification work.
</p>
<p>There are a set of threats to routing protocols that are considered
        in-scope for this document, and a set considered out-of-
        scope. These are described in detail in the Threats (Section 2)
        section below.

<a name="rfc.section.1.4"></a><h3>1.4.&nbsp;
Incremental Approach</h3>

<p>The work also serves as an agreement between the Routing Area and
        the Security Area about the priorities and work plan for incrementally
        delivering the above work. The principle of crawl, walk, run will be in
        place and routing protocol authentication mechanisms may not go
      immediately from their current state to a state containing the
      best possible, most modern security practices.  This point is important as
      there will be
        times when the best-security-possible will give way to vastly-
        improved-over-current-security-but-admittedly-not-yet-best-security-
        possible, in order that incremental progress toward a more secure
        Internet may be achieved. As such, this document will call out places
        where agreement has been reached on such trade offs.
</p>
<p>	Incremental steps will need to be taken for
        a few very practical reasons. First, there are a considerable number
        of deployed routing devices in operating networks that will not be
        able to run the most modern cryptographic mechanisms without
        significant and unacceptable performance penalties. The roadmap for
        any one routing protocol MUST allow for incremental improvements on
        existing operational devices. Second, current routing protocol
        performance on deployed devices has been achieved over the last 20
        years through extensive tuning of software and hardware elements, and
        is a constant focus for improvement by vendors and operators alike.
        The introduction of new security mechanisms affects this performance
        balance. The performance impact of any incremental step of security
        improvement will need to be weighed by the community, and introduced
        in such a way that allows the vendor and operator community a path to
        adoption that upholds reasonable performance metrics. Therefore,
        certain specification elements may be introduced carrying the "SHOULD"
        guidance, with the intention that the same mechanism will carry a
        "MUST" in the next release of the specification.  
</p>
<p>This gives the
        vendors and implementors the guidance they need to tune their software
        and hardware appropriately over time. Last, some security mechanisms
        require the build out of other operational support systems, and this
        will take time. An example where these three reasons are at play in an
        incremental improvement roadmap is seen in the improvement of BGP's
        <a class='info' href='#RFC4271'>[RFC4271]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Li, T., and S. Hares, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> security via the update of the TCP
        Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt] effort. It
        would be ideal, and reflect best common security practice, to have a
        fully specified key management protocol for negotiating TCP-AO's
        authentication material, using certificates for peer authentication in
        the keying. 
         
</p>
<p> However, in the spirit of incremental deployment, we will
        first address issues like cryptographic algorithm agility, replay
        attacks, TCP session resetting in the base TCP-AO protocol before we
        layer key management on top of it.

Goals</h3>

<p>The goals and general guidance for the KARP work follow:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Provide authentication and integrity protection for packets on
        the wire of existing routing protocols
</li>
<li>Deliver a path to incrementally improve security of the routing
        infrastructure as explained in the earlier sections. 
</li>
<li>The deployability of the improved security solutions on
        currently running routing infrastructure equipment. This begs the
        consideration of the current state of processing power available on
        routers in the network today.
</li>
<li>Operational deployability - A solutions acceptability will also
        be measured by how deployable the solution is by common operator teams
        using common deployment processes and infrastructures. I.e. We will
        try to make these solutions fit as well as possible into current
        operational practices or router deployment. This will be heavily
        influenced by operator input, to ensure that what we specify can --
        and, more importantly, will -- be deployed once specified and
        implemented by vendors. Deployment of incrementally more secure
        routing infrastructure in the Internet is the final measure of
        success. Measurably, we would like to see an increase in the number of
        surveyed respondents who report deploying the updated authentication
        mechanisms anywhere across their network, as well as a sharp rise in
        usage for the total percentage of their network's routers.
        <br />
<br />

        Interviews with operators show several points about routing
        security. First, over 70% of operators have deployed transport
        connection protection via TCP-MD5 on their EBGP <a class='info' href='#ISR2008'>[ISR2008]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McPherson, D. and C. Labovitz, &ldquo;Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Over 55% also deploy MD5 on their IBGP
        connections, and 50% deploy MD5 on some other IGP. The survey states
        that "a considerable increase was observed over previous editions of
        the survey for use of TCP MD5 with external peers (eBGP), internal
        peers (iBGP) and MD5 extensions for IGPs." Though the data is not
        captured in the report, the authors believe anecdotally that of those
        who have deployed MD5 somewhere in their network, only about 25-30% of
        the routers in their network are deployed with the authentication
        enabled. None report using IPsec to protect the routing protocol, and
        this was a decline from the few that reported doing so in the previous
        year's report. From my personal conversations with operators, of those
        using MD5, almost all report deploying with one single manual key
        throughout the entire network. These same operators report that the
        one single key has not been changed since it was originally installed,
        sometimes five or more years ago. When asked why, particularly for the
        case of BGP using TCP MD5, the following reasons are often given:
		
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Changing the keys triggers a TCP reset, and thus bounces the
        links/adjacencies, undermining Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd>For external peers, difficulty of coordination with the other
        organization is an issue. Once they find the correct contact at the
        other organization (not always so easy), the coordination function is
        serialized and on a per peer/AS basis. The coordination is very
        cumbersome and tedious to execute in practice. 
</dd>
<dt>C.</dt>
<dd> Keys must be changed
        at precisely the same time, or at least within 60 seconds (as
        supported by two major vendors) in order to limit connectivity outage
        duration. This is incredibly difficult to do, operationally,
        especially between different organizations. 
</dd>
<dt>D.</dt>
<dd> Relatively low priority compared to other operational issues. 
</dd>
<dt>E.</dt>
<dd> Lack of staff to implement  the changes device by device.
</dd>
<dt>F.</dt>
<dd>  There are three use cases for
        operational peering at play here: peers and interconnection with other
        operators, Internal BGP and other routing sessions within a single
        operator, and operator-to-customer-CPE devices. All three have very
        different properties, and all are reported as cumbersome. One operator
        reported that the same key is used for all customer premise equipment.
        The same operator reported that if the customer mandated, a unique key
        could be created, although the last time this occurred it created such
        an operational headache that the administrators now usually tell
        customers that the option doesn't even exist, to avoid the
        difficulties. These customer-unique keys are never changed, unless the
        customer demands so. The main threat at play here is that a terminated
        employee from such an operator who had access to the one (or few) keys
        used for authentication in these environments could easily wage an
        attack -- or offer the keys to others who would wage the attack -- and
        bring down many of the adjacencies, causing destabilization to the
        routing system.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Whatever mechanisms we specify need to be easier than the current
        methods to deploy, and should provide obvious operational efficiency
        gains along with significantly better security and threat protection.
        This combination of value may be enough to drive much broader
        adoption.
</li>
<li>Address the threats enumerated above in the "Threats" section
        (Section 2) for each routing protocol, along a roadmap. Not all
        threats may be able to be addressed in the first specification update
        for any one protocol. Roadmaps will be defined so that both the
        security area and the routing area agree on how the threats will be
        addressed completely over time.
</li>
<li>Create a re-usable architecture, framework, and guidelines for
        various IETF working teams who will address these security
        improvements for various Routing Protocols. The crux of the KARP work
        is to re-use that framework as much as possible across relevant
        Routing Protocols. For example, designers should aim to re-use the key
        management protocol that will be defined for BGP's TCP-AO key
        establishment for as many other routing protocols as possible. This is
        but one example.
</li>
<li>Bridge any gaps between IETF's Routing and Security Areas by
        recording agreements on work items, roadmaps, and guidance from the
        Area leads and Internet Architecture Board (IAB, www.iab.org).

<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Routing Area working group chairs and participants - These people
        are charged with updates to the Routing Protocol specifications. Any
        and all cryptographic authentication work on these specifications will
        occur in Routing Area working groups, with close partnership with the
        Security Area. Co- advisors from Security Area may often be named for
        these partnership efforts.
</li>
<li>Security Area reviewers of routing area documents - These people
        are delegated by the Security Area Directors to perform reviews on
        routing protocol specifications as they pass through working group
        last call or IESG review. They will pay particular attention to the
        use of cryptographic authentication and corresponding security
        mechanisms for the routing protocols. They will ensure that
        incremental security improvements are being made, in line with this
        roadmap.
</li>
<li>Security Area engineers - These people partner with routing area
        authors/designers on the security mechanisms in routing protocol
        specifications. Some of these security area engineers will be assigned
        by the Security Area Directors, while others will be interested
        parties in the relevant working groups.
</li>
<li>Operators - The operators are a key audience for this work, as
        the work is considered to have succeeded if the operators deploy the
        technology, presumably due to a perception of significantly improved
        security value coupled with relative similarity to deployment
        complexity and cost. Conversely, the work will be considered a failure
        if the operators do not care to deploy it, either due to lack of value
        or perceived (or real) over- complexity of operations. And as such,
        the GROW and OPSEC WGs should be kept squarely in the loop as
        well.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Threats In Scope</h3>

<p>The threats that will be addressed in this roadmap are those from
        OUTSIDERS, attackers that may reside anywhere in the Internet, have
        the ability to send IP traffic to the router, may be able to observe
        the router's replies, and may even control the path for a legitimate
        peer's traffic. These are not legitimate participants in the routing
        protocol. Message authentication and integrity protection specifically
        aims to identify messages originating from OUTSIDERS.
</p>
<p>The concept of OUTSIDERS can be further refined to include
        attackers who are terminated employees, and those sitting on-path.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>On-Path - attackers with control of a network resource or a tap
        along the path of packets between two routers. An on-path outsider can
        attempt a man-in-the-middle attack, in addition to several other
        attack classes. A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack occurs when an
        attacker who has access to packets flowing between two peers tampers
        with those packets in such a way that both peers think they are
        talking to each other directly, when in fact they are actually talking
        to the attacker only. Protocols conforming to this roadmap will use
        cryptographic mechanisms to prevent a man-in-the-middle attacker from
        situating himself undetected.
</li>
<li>Terminated Employees - in this context, those who had access
        router configuration that included keys or keying material like
        pre-shared keys used in securing the routing protocol. Using this
        material, the attacker could send properly MAC'd spoofed packets
        appearing to come from router A to router B, and thus impersonate an
        authorized peer. The attacker could then send false traffic that
        changes the network behavior from its operator's design. The goal of
        addressing this source specifically is to call out the case where new
        keys or keying material becomes necessary very quickly, with little
        operational expense, upon the termination of such an employee. This
        grouping could also refer to any attacker who somehow managed to gain
        access to keying material, and said access had been detected by the
        operators such that the operators have an opportunity to move to new
        keys in order to prevent an attack.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These attack actions are in scope for this roadmap:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Spoofing - when an unauthorized device assumes the identity of an
        authorized one. Spoofing can be used, for example, to inject malicious
        routing information that causes the disruption of network services.
        Spoofing can also be used to cause a neighbor relationship to form
        that subsequently denies the formation of the relationship with the
        legitimate router.
</li>
<li>Falsification - an action whereby an attacker sends false routing
        information. To falsify the routing information, an attacker has to be
        either the originator or a forwarder of the routing information.
        Falsification may occur by an originator, or a forwarder, and may
        involve overclaiming, misclaiming, or mistatement of network resource
        reachability. We must be careful to remember that in this work we are
        only targeting falsification from outsiders as may occur from
        tampering with packets in flight. Falsification from BYZANTINES (see
        the Threats Out of Scope section (Section 2.2) below) are not
        addressed by the KARP effort.
</li>
<li>Interference - when an attacker inhibits the exchanges by
        legitimate routers. The types of interference addressed by this work
        include:
        
        
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Adding noise
</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd>Replaying out-dated packets
</dd>
<dt>C.</dt>
<dd>Inserting messages
</dd>
<dt>D.</dt>
<dd>Corrupting messages
</dd>
<dt>E.</dt>
<dd>Breaking synchronization
</dd>
<dt>F.</dt>
<dd>Changing message content
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</li>
<li>DoS attacks on transport sub-systems - This includes any other
        DoS attacks specifically based on the above attack types. This is when
        an attacker sends spoofed packets aimed at halting or preventing the
        underlying protocol over which the routing protocol runs, for example
        halting a BGP session by sending a TCP FIN or RST packet. Since this
        attack depends on spoofing, operators are encouraged to deploy proper
       authentication mechanisms to prevent such attacks.
</li>
<li>DoS attacks using the authentication mechanism - This includes an
        attacker sending packets which confuse or overwhelm a security
        mechanism itself. An example is initiating an overwhelming load of
        spoofed authenticated route messages so that the receiver needs to
        process the MAC check, only to discard the packet, sending CPU levels
        rising. Another example is when an attacker sends an overwhelming load
        of keying protocol initiations from bogus sources. All other possible
        DoS attacks are out of scope (see next section).
</li>
<li>Brute Force Attacks Against Password/Keys - This includes either
        online or offline attacks where attempts are made repeatedly using
        different keys/passwords until a match is found. While it is
        impossible to make brute force attacks on keys completely
        unsuccessful, proper design can make such attacks much harder to
        succeed. For example, the key length should be sufficiently long so
        that covering the entire space of possible keys is improbable using
        computational power expected to be available 10 years out or more.
        Using per session keys is another widely used method for reducing
       the number of brute force attacks as this would make it difficult to guess
       the keys.

Threats Out of Scope</h3>

<p>Threats from BYZANTINE sources -- faulty, misconfigured, or
        subverted routers, i.e., legitimate participants in the routing
        protocol -- are out of scope for this roadmap. Any of the attacks
        described in the above section (Section 2.1) that may be levied by a
        BYZANTINE source are therefore also out of scope.
</p>
<p>In addition, these other attack actions are out of scope for this
        work:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Sniffing - passive observation of route message contents in
        flight
</li>
<li>Falsification by Byzantine sources - unauthorized message content
        by a legitimate authorized source.
</li>
<li>Interference due to:

            attack that this work will address. Many other such examples could
            be contrived.

Requirements for Phase 1 of a Routing Protocol Transport's Security Update</h3>

<p>The following list of requirements SHOULD be addressed by a KARP Work
      Phase 1 security update to any Routing Protocol (according to section
      4.1 of the KARP Design Guide <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;karp&#8209;design&#8209;guide]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lebovitz, G. and M. Bhatia, &ldquo;Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> document). IT IS RECOMMENDED
      that any Phase 1 security update to a Rouing Protocol contain a section
      of the specification document that describes how each of these
      requirements are met. It is further RECOMMENDED that textual
      justification be presented for any requirements that are NOT
      addressed.
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Clear definitions of which elements of the transmission (frame,
      packet, segment, etc.) are protected by the authentication mechanism
</li>
<li>Strong algorithms, and defined and accepted by the security
      community, MUST be specified. The option should use algorithms
      considered accepted by the IETF's Security community, which are
      considered appropriately safe. The use of non-standard or unpublished
      algorithms SHOULD BE avoided.
</li>
<li>Algorithm agility for the cryptographic algorithms used in the
      authentication MUST be specified, i.e. more than one algorithm MUST be
      specified and it MUST be clear how new algorithms MAY be specified and
      used within the protocol. This requirement exists in case one algorithm
      gets broken suddenly. Research to identify weakness in algorithms is
      constant. Breaking a cipher isn't a matter of if, but when it will
      occur. It's highly unlikely that two different algorithms will be broken
      simultaneously. So, if two are supported, and one gets broken, we can
      use the other until we get a new one in place. Having the ability within
      the protocol specification to support such an event, having algorithm
      agility, is essential. Mandating two algorithms provides both a
      redundancy, and a mechanism for enacting that redundancy when needed.
      Further, the mechanism MUST describe the generic interface for new
      cryptographic algorithms to be used, so that implementers can use
      algorithms other than those specified, and so that new algorithms may be
      specified and supported in the future.
</li>
<li>Secure use of simple PSKs, offering both operational convenience
      as well as building something of a fence around stupidity, MUST be
      specified.
</li>
<li>Inter-connection replay protection. Packets captured from one
      session  MUST NOT be able to be re-sent and accepted during a later
      session. In OSPF parlance, or other non TCP based protocols, two routers
      have a session up if they are able to exchange protocol packets. In OSPF, a
     session between two routers is called an adjacency only if the neighbor FSM 
	is in ExStart or a higher state. An OSPF session between two routers
     must go through two main stages of two-way connectivity and LSDB
     synchronization before an OSPF adjacency is fully established.
     
</li>
<li>Intra-connection replay protection. Packets captured during a
      session MUST NOT be able to be re-sent and accepted during that same
      session, to deal with long-lived connections. The design teams
      may thus want to provide a sufficiently large sequence number space for
    providing intra-connection replay protection. Additionally, replay
      mechanisms MUST work correctly even in the presence of Routing Protocol
      packet prioritization by the router.
</li>
<li> A change of security parameters REQUIRES, and even forces, a
      change of session traffic keys
</li>
<li>Intra-connection re-keying which occurs without a break or
      interruption to the current peering session, and, if possible, without
      data loss, MUST be specified. Keys need to be changed periodically, for
      operational privacey (e.g. when an administrator who had access to the
      keys leaves an organization) and for entropy purposes, and a re-keying
      mechanism enables the deployers to execute the change without
      productivity loss.
</li>
<li>Efficient re-keying SHOULD be provided. The specificaion SHOULD
      support rekeying during a connection without the need to expend undue
      computational resources. In particular, the specification SHOULD avoid
      the need to try/compute multiple keys on a given packet.
</li>
<li>Prevent DoS attacks as those described as in-scope in the threats
      section Section 2.1 above.
</li>
<li>Default mechanisms and algorithms specified and defined are
      REQUIRED for all implementations.
</li>
<li>For backward compatibilty reasons manual keying MUST be supported.
</li>
<li>Architecture of the specification SHOULD consider and allow for
      future use of a KMP.
</li>
<li>The authentication mechanism in the Routing Protocol MUST be
      decoupled from the key management system used. It MUST be obvious how
      the keying material was obtained, and the process for obtaining the
      keying material MUST exist outside of the Routing Protocol. This will
      allow for the various key generation methods, like manual keys and KMPs,
      to be used with the same Routing Protocol mechanism.
</li>
<li>Convergence times of the Routing Protocols SHOULD NOT be
      materially affected. Materially here is defined as anything greater than
      a 5% convergence time increase. Note that convergence is different than
      boot time. Also note that convergence time has a lot to do with the
      speed of processors used on individual routing peers, and this
      processing power increases by Moore's law over time, meaning that the
      same route calculations and table population routines will decrease in
      duration over time. Therefore, this requirement should be considered
      only in terms of total number of messages that must be exchanged, and
      less for the computational intensity of processing any one message.
     Alternatively this can be simplified by saying that the new mechanisms
    should only result in a minimal increase in the number of routing protocol
    messages passed between the peers.
</li>
<li>The changes or addition of security mechanisms SHOULD NOT cause a
      refresh of route updates or cause additional route updates to be
      generated.
</li>
<li>Router implementations provide prioritized treatment to certain
      protocol packets. For example, OSPF HELLO messages and ACKs are
      prioritized for processing above other OSPF packets. The authentication
      mechanism SHOULD NOT interfere with the ability to observe and enforce
      such prioritization. Any effect on such priority mechanisms MUST be
      explicitly documented and justified.Replay mechanisms provided by the routing protocols 
      MUST work even if certain protocol packets are offered prioritized treatment.

</li>
<li>The authentication mechanism does not provide message
      confidentiality, but SHOULD NOT preclude the possibility of
      confidentiality support being added in the future.
</li>
<li> Routing protocols MUST only send minimal information regarding
		   the authentication mechanisms and the parameters in its protocol
 			packets to avoid exposing the information to parties on the path. 
</li>
<li> In most routing protocols (OSPF, ISIS, BFD, RIP, etc), all speakers share the
		  same key on a broadcast segment. Possession of the key itself is used for identity 
		  validation and no other identity check is used. This opens a window for an attack 
		 where the sender can masquerade as some other neighbor. Routing protocols SHOULD
		 thus use some other information besides the key to validate a neighbor. 
		One could look at <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-opsec-routing-protocols-crypto-issues'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;opsec&#8209;routing&#8209;protocols&#8209;crypto&#8209;issues]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jaeggli, J., Hares, S., Bhatia, M., Manral, V., and R. White, &ldquo;Issues with existing Cryptographic Protection Methods for Routing Protocols,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> for details 
		on such attacks. 
</li>
<li>	Routing protocols that rely on the IP header (or information beyond the routing 
				protocol payload) to identify the neighbor which originated the packet must 
				either protect the IP header or provide some other means to identify the neighbor. 
				<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-opsec-routing-protocols-crypto-issues'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;opsec&#8209;routing&#8209;protocols&#8209;crypto&#8209;issues]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jaeggli, J., Hares, S., Bhatia, M., Manral, V., and R. White, &ldquo;Issues with existing Cryptographic Protection Methods for Routing Protocols,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> 
				describes some attacks that are based on this. 
</li>
<li>The new security and authentication mechanisms MUST support
      incremental deployment. It will not be feasible to deploy a new Routing
      Protocol authentication mechanism throughout the network
      instantaneously. It also may not be possible to deploy such a mechanism
      to all routers in a large autonomous system (AS) at one time. Proposed
      solutions SHOULD support an incremental deployment method that provides
      some benefit for those who participate. Because of this, there are
      several requirements that any proposed KARP mechanism should
      consider.

      
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>The Routing Protocol security mechanism MUST enable each router
          to configure use of the security mechanism on a per- peer basis
          where the communication is one-on-one.
</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd>The new KARP mechanism MUST provide backward compatibility in the
          message formatting, transmission, and processing of routing
          information carried through a mixed security environment. Message
          formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be handled in a
          non-backward compatible fashion though care must be taken to ensure
          that routing protocol packets can traverse intermediate routers
          which don't support the new format.
</dd>
<dt>C.</dt>
<dd>In an environment where both secured and non-secured systems are
          interoperating a mechanism MUST exist for secured systems to
          identify whether an originator intended the information to be
          secured.
</dd>
<dt>D.</dt>
<dd>In an environment where secured service is in the process of
          being deployed a mechanism MUST exist to support a transition free
          of service interruption (caused by the deployment per se).
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The introduction of mechanisms to improve routing authentication
      and security may increase the processing performed by a router. Since
      most of the currently deployed routers do not have hardware to
      accelerate cryptographic operations, these operations could impose a
      significant processing burden under some circumstances. Thus proposed
      solutions should be evaluated carefully with regard to the processing
      burden they may impose, since deployment may be impeded if network
      operators perceive that a solution will impose a processing burden which
      either provokes substantial capital expense, or threatens to destabilize routers.
</li>
<li>Given the high number of routers that would require the new
      authentication mechanisms in a typical ISP deployment, solutions can
      increase their appeal by minimizing the burden imposed on all routers in
      favor of confining significant work loads to a relatively small number
      of devices. Optional features or increased assurance that provokes more
      pervasive processing load MAY be made available for deployments where
      the additional resources are economically justifiable.
</li>
<li>The new authentication and security mechanisms should not rely on
      systems external to the routing system (the equipment that is performing
      forwarding). In order to ensure the rapid initialization and/or return
      to service of failed nodes it is important to reduce reliance on these
      external systems to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, proposed
      solutions SHOULD NOT require connections to external systems, beyond
      those directly involved in peering relationships, in order to return to
      full service. It is however acceptable for the proposed
      solutions to require post initialization synchronization with
      external systems in order to fully synchronize the security
      information.
