1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   Technologies for textual chatrooms customarily enable participants to
   specify a nickname for use in the room; e.g., this is true of
   Internet Relay Chat [RFC2811] as well as multi-party chat
   technologies based on the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   (XMPP) [RFC6120] [XEP-0045], the Message Session Relay Protocol
   (MSRP) [RFC4975] [I-D.ietf-simple-chat], and Centralized Conferencing
   (XCON) [RFC5239] [I-D.boulton-xcon-session-chat].  Recent chatroom
   technologies also allow internationalized nicknames because they
   support characters from outside the ASCII range [RFC20], typically by
   means of the Unicode character set [UNICODE].  Although such
   nicknames tend to be used primarily for display purposes, they are
   sometimes used for programmatic purposes as well (e.g., kicking users
   or avoiding nickname conflicts).  Note too that nicknames can be used
   not only in chatrooms but also more generally as a user's preferred
   display name (see for instance [XEP-0172]).

Internet-Draft               PRECIS Nickname                January 2014


   To increase the likelihood that nicknames will work in ways that make
   sense for typical users throughout the world, this document defines
   rules for preparing and comparing internationalized nicknames.

1.2.  Terminology

   Many important terms used in this document are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework], [RFC6365], and [UNICODE].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Rules

   A nickname MUST consist only of Unicode code points that conform to
   the "FreeformClass" string class defined in
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].

   For preparation purposes (most commonly, when a chatroom client
   generates a nickname from user input for inclusion as a protocol
   element that represents a "nickname slot"), an application MUST at a
   minimum ensure that the string conforms to the "FreeformClass" string
   class defined in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework]; however, it MAY in
   addition perform the normalization and mapping operations specified
   below for comparison purposes.

   For comparison purposes (e.g., when a chatroom server determines if
   two nicknames are in conflict during the authorization process), an
   application MUST treat a nickname as specified below (these rules
   constitute the "NicknameFreeformClass" profile).  The operations
   specified MUST be completed in the order shown (in particular,
   normalization MUST be performed after the other mapping steps and
   before validity-checking against the definition of the PRECIS
   "FreeformClass", consistent with [I-D.ietf-precis-framework]).

   1.  So-called additional mappings MAY be applied, such as those
       defined in [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings].  (Note that mapping of
       fullwidth and halfwidth characters to their decomposition
       mappings is not necessary, since those mappings are performed as
       part of normalization using NFKC as mandated below.)


   2.  Non-ASCII space characters from the "N" category defined under
       Section 6.14 of [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] MUST be mapped to
       U+0020 SPACE.

Internet-Draft               PRECIS Nickname                January 2014


   3.  Leading and trailing whitespace (i.e., one or more instances of
       the ASCII space character at the beginning or end of a nickname)
       MUST be removed (e.g., "stpeter " is mapped to "stpeter").


   4.  Interior sequences of more than one ASCII space character MUST be
       mapped to a single ASCII space character (e.g., "St  Peter" is
       mapped to "St Peter").


   5.  Uppercase and titlecase characters MUST be mapped to their
       lowercase equivalents.  In applications that prohibit conflicting
       nicknames, this rule helps to reduce the possibility of confusion
       by ensuring that nicknames differing only by case (e.g.,
       "stpeter" vs. "StPeter") would not be allowed in a chatroom at
       the same time.


   6.  The string MUST be normalized using Unicode Normalization Form KC
       (NFKC).  Because NFKC is more "aggressive" in finding matches
       than other normalization forms (in the terminology of Unicode, it
       performs both canonical and compatibility decomposition before
       recomposing code points), this rule helps to reduce the
       possibility of confusion by increasing the number of characters
       that would match (e.g., U+2163 ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR would match the
       combination of U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I and U+0056 LATIN
       CAPITAL LETTER V).


   7.  Finally, the rules for the PRECIS "FreeformClass" MUST be
       applied, as specified in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].

   For both preparation and comparison, the "Bidi Rule" defined in
   [RFC5893] applies to the directionality of a nickname.

3.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate a small number of nicknames that
   are consistent with the format defined above, along with the output
   string resulting from application of the PRECIS rules, which would be
   used for comparison purposes (note that the characters < and > are
   used to delineate the actual nickname and are not part of the
   nickname strings).

   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+

   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | 1 | <Foo>                 | <foo>                             |
   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | 2 | <foo>                 | <foo>                             |
   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | 3 | <Foo Bar>             | <foo bar>                         |
   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | 4 | <foo bar>             | <foo bar>                         |

   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | 7 | <&#x3C2;>             | GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA    |

   | 8 | <&#x265A;>            | BLACK CHESS KING (U+265A)         |
   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+


   Regarding examples 5, 6, and 7: case-mapping of GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
   SIGMA (U+03A3) to lowercase (i.e., to GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA,
   U+03C3) during comparison would result in matching the nicknames in
   examples 5 and 6; however, because the PRECIS mapping rules do not
   account for the special status of GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA
   (U+03C2), the nicknames in examples 5 and 7 or examples 6 and 7 would
   not be matched.  Regarding example 8: symbol characters such as BLACK
   CHESS KING (U+265A) are allowed by the PRECIS FreeformClass and thus
   can be used in nicknames.

   The following examples illustrate strings that are not valid
   nicknames because they violate the format defined above.

4.  Use in Application Protocols

   This specification defines only the PRECIS-based rules for handling
   of nickname strings.  It is the responsibility of an application
   protocol (e.g., MSRP, XCON, or XMPP) to specify the protocol slots in
   which nickname strings can appear, as well as the entities that are
   expected to enforce the rules governing nickname strings in that
   protocol (e.g., chat servers, chat clients, or both).  Above and
   beyond the PRECIS-based rules specified here, application protocols
   can also define application-specific rules governing nickname strings
   (rules regarding the minimum or maximum length of nicknames, further
   restrictions on allowable characters or character ranges, safeguards
   to mitigate the effects of visually similar characters, etc.).
   Naturally, application protocols can also specify rules governing the
   actual use of nicknames in applications (reserved nicknames,
   authorization requirements for using nicknames, whether certain
   nicknames can be prohibited, handling of duplicates, the relationship
   between nicknames and underlying identifiers such as SIP URIs or
   Jabber Identifiers, etc.).

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall add the following entry to the PRECIS Profiles
   Registry:

   Name:  NicknameFreeformClass.

   Applicability:  Nicknames in messaging and text conferencing
      technologies such as MSRP, XCON, and XMPP.

   Base Class:  FreeformClass.

   Replaces:  None.

   Width Mapping:  None (handled via NFKC).

   Additional Mappings:  Map non-ASCII space characters to ASCII space,
      strip leading and trailing space characters, map interior
      sequences of multiple space characters to a single ASCII space.

   Case Mapping:  Map uppercase and titlecase characters to lowercase.

   Normalization:  NFKC.

   Directionality:  The "Bidi Rule" defined in RFC 5893 applies.

   Exclusions:  None.

   Enforcement:  To be specified by applications.

   Specification:  RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please change XXXX to
      the number issued for this specification.]

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Reuse of PRECIS

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework]
   apply to the "FreeformClass" string class used in this document for
   nicknames.

6.2.  Reuse of Unicode

   The security considerations described in [UTS39] apply to the use of
   Unicode characters in nicknames.

6.3.  Visually Similar Characters

   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] describes some of the security
   considerations related to visually similar characters, also called
   "confusable characters" or "confusables".

   Although the mapping rules defined under Section 2 of this document
   are designed in part to reduce the possibility of confusion about
   nicknames, this document does not provide more detailed
   recommendations regarding the handling of visually similar
   characters, such as those provided in [UTS39].
