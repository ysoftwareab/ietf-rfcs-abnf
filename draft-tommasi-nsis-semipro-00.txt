Internet-Draft      Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment       February 2006



Abstract

   Re-establishment of QoS after a Mobile Node handover must be done 
   as quickly as possible in order to reduce degradation or 
   interruption of QoS. It is specifically useful if real-time 
   applications are used.
   We propose a Semi-Proactive procedure for QoS re-establisment that 
   also avoids waste of resources. 
   Moreover, we propose a new point of buffering for the packets 
   destined to the Mobile Node during the handover. This is useful when 
   QoS is required for these packets.

1 Introduction

   Mobile IP [1][2] is a protocol that allows a Mobile Node(MN) to 
   communicate to other Internet nodes after changing its link-layer 
   point of attachment without loosing its IP address.
   Thus, Mobile IP provides the node for maintaining higher-layer 
   connection while moving.

   NSIS Working Group[3] uses a two layer architecture for a signaling 
   protocol:
     - NTLP (GIST) [4] carries signaling messages between neighboring 
       peers; 
     - QoS-NSLP [5] manages resource reservation.

   In order to allow the signal packets to have a secure GIST path 
   supply the modality "connection" creating an association between the 
   adjacent GIST nodes. This same association is known as Messaging 
   Association.

   According to the regular specification of the NSIS protocols the re-
   establishment of the QoS occurs after the handover, that is in a 
   reactive way. This means that both NTLP and QoS-NSLP act after the 
   handover in order to re-establish the proper QoS on the New path.

   The installation of the state in the New path must be done as 
   quickly as possible in order to reduce the degradation of QoS for 
   the mobile node which is specifically useful if real-time 
   applications are used.

   A basic idea for reducing such delay would be to re-establish QoS 
   before the handover on the possible future paths, that is to act in 
   a proactive way. 
   Of course this means that there will be a waste of resources since 
   there is no guarantee that the handover will occur and because 
   resources are assigned for all Candidate path.

   We therefore, propose to exploit pros and cons of both situations by
   creating the Messaging Associations in a proactive way and by assigning
   resources in a reactive way, let us say in a semi-proactive way.
   This solution anticipates the creation of the associations before 
   the handover. Resource reservation is performed usually after the 
   handover but the total time is at a minimum.
   Moreover, resources are assigned only to the effective path for 
   avoiding a waste of resources.

   In our solution the re-establishment is faster also because we 
   introduce the possibility of buffering, in an intermediate node of 
   the end-to-end path, the packets destined to MN.
   This node is known as the Candidate CRossover Node (CCRN).    

   Consequently, in this solution no messages have been introduced in 
   the QoS-NSLP and NTLP protocols; we need just to add a flag (M -
   Mobility flag) to all messages and some GIST TLV objects to help the

   discovery of the CCRN as we will explain in section 4.   
   The procedures described in the following paragraphs are applicable 
   in networks served by Mobile IPv4 with Route Optimization [6] or 
   Mobile IPv6 (in which the Route Optimization is integrated).

   the network;

   Correspondent Node (CN): network node with which MN is communicating 
   at the time;

   Access Router (AR): access node to the network for an MN;

   Previous AR (PAR): AR for the MN before the handover;

   Candidate AR (CAR): possible AR for a handover of the MN;

   New AR (NAR): AR for the MN after the handover;

   New path: path between CN and NAR;

   Old path: path between CN and PAR;

   Candidate path: path between CN and CAR;

   Crossover node (CRN): one of the nodes NSIS aware of the 
   intersection between the Old and New path;

   Candidate CRN (CCRN): one of the nodes NSIS aware of the 
   intersection between the Old and Candidate path;

3.1 Introduction to the procedure

   Remembering that QoS-NSLP supports both the sender-initiated and the 
   receiver-initiated reservation. 

   The entity that sends the Reserve message takes the name of QoS NSIS 
   Initiator (QNI) and the entity that receives that message takes the 
   name of QoS NSIS Responder (QNR). 
   The intermediary NSIS aware takes the name of QoS NSIS Entity (QNE). 
   In the case of sender-initiated reservation (figure 1), the Reserve 
   message travels in the same direction of the data flow. Therefore, 
   QNI is the NSIS aware node closest to the sender of that flow.
   Passing between the nodes, the Reserve message allows GIST to create 
   the GA.

   In the case of a receiver-initiated reservation (figure 2), the 
   Reserve message travels in the opposite direction to the data flow. 
   Therefore, QNI is the NSIS aware node closest to the afore mentioned 
   flow receiver. In this case, due to asymmetric routing, the QNR must 
   send a Query message to allow the GIST to create a GA.

   The procedure we are presenting in this draft, the semi-proactive 
   procedure, proposes to re-establish the QoS as fast as possible. 

   The key point of the situation is to initiate, in a proactive way, 
   as many operations as possible without wasting the resources 
   available.
   In order to do this we propose to create the GA before the handover 
   and to reserve the resources on the New path after the moving of the 
   MN. The Reserve message therefore can only be sent after the 
   handover.

   In case of receiver-initiated reservation(figure 3) it easy to 
   define a separation between the creation of the state and the 
   reservation of the resources. In fact it is only necessary that the 
   QNR (close to the sender of data flow) sends the Query message

   before the handover and the QNI responds with Reserve message after 
   the movement of the MN.

   The problem is the separation of the two phases when the reservation 
   is sender-initiated. 
   Also in this case, the Query message is used in order to obtain the 
   separation between the GA creation and the resource reservation 
   (figure 4).

   In addition, we would like to consider that in the proactive phase 
   the PAR has available a list of CAR. Every one of these should be 
   considered to be like QNI or QNR on the basis of type of the 
   reservation and sends/receives the Query message for the creation of 
   the GA.

   The procedure consists of three main sections:
     1. Triggering, in which the PAR communicate to the correct end-
       point of sending the Query message.
     2. Proactive, in which the Query message allows the creation of
       the GIST state and the discovery of the CCRN.
     3. Reactive, in which resources are reserved.

3.2 Triggering section

   step 1): the MN asks the PAR for the list of CARs and notifies the 
     PAR to send the trigger message.

   step 2): if the MN is the sender of the data flow, the PAR triggers 
     each CAR for creating a GA towards the CN. Instead, if the MN is the 
     receiver of the data flow, the PAR triggers the CN for creating a GA 
     into each path towards the CARs;



3.3 Proactive section 
 
   The aim of this section is to describe the creation of the GA in a 
   proactive way.



3.3.1 Classification of the end-points

   In NSIS a resource reservation can be sender or receiver-initiated.
   In the first case, the sender of the data flow is the starter of the 
   reservation while in the case of receiver-initiated reservation the 
   receiver is the starter.

   From the MN point of view two other cases exist: the MN is the 
   sender or the receiver of the data stream.

   The possible combinations are shown in figure 5.




        +---------------------+----------------------------------+
        |           \  MN     |     Sender      |   Receiver     |
        |Reservation \        |                 |                |
        +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
        | Sender-initiated    | CAR=QNI,CN=QNR  | CAR=QNR,CN=QNI |
        +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
        | Receiver-initiated  | CAR =QNR,CN=QNI | CAR =QNI,CN=QNR|
        +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+

   According to the current definition of NSIS a QoS-NSLP, the Reserve 
   message travels from QNI to QNR and the QoS-NSLP Query follows the 
   data flow direction.



3.3.2 Receiver-initiated reservation

   The Query message is sent by QNR node in downstream direction 
   towards the QNI. We add a mobility flag to allow to a QNE to 
   distinguishing the regular NSIS procedure. 
   When QNI receive this message it waits to the end of the handover to 
   respond with a Reserve message that contains mobility flag.

   No other messages, TLV objects or fields are needed.  



3.3.3 Sender-initiated reservation    

   The Query message is sent in a downstream direction in the same way
   as the receiver-initiated reservation case. 
   An important difference is that this message travels from the QNI to 
   the QNR.
   After the handover the QNR which has received a Query message will 
   wait for the Reserve message with the mobility flag, without taking 
   any action.



3.3.4 Proactive selection of the CAR

   In order to optimize this procedure it is possible to define a 
   selective algorithm to choose a given CAR from the set of CARs using 
   information such as the characteristic of the service offered by the 
   CAR.   
   The definition of such algorithm is out of the scope to this version 
   of the document. 



3.4 Reactive section

   The aim of this paragraph is to define the procedures executed after 
   the MN handover.




F.Tommasi, et al.              Expires August 2006               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment       February 2006



   The GA has been installed as previously mentioned in the paths 
   between the CN and a CAR each.
   The resource reservation is performed only on the path from the QNI 
   to the QNR in reactive way.

   The possible scenarios are described in the following figure.




     +---------------------+----------------------------------+
     |           \  MN     |     Sender      |   Receiver     |
     |Reservation \        |                 |                |
     +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
     | Sender-initiated    | NAR=QNI,CN=QNR  | NAR=QNR,CN=QNI |
     +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+
     | Receiver-initiated  | NAR =QNR,CN=QNI | NAR =QNI,CN=QNR|
     +---------------------+-----------------+----------------+

           Figure 6 : Nodes in the Reactive phase



   After the handover QNI will send a Reserve message. The QNR will 
   answer with a Response message. Both messages contain the mobility 
   flag.

   In order to benefit from this procedure the NAR has to be one of the 
   CAR otherwise there wouldn't be a GA with the CN and the procedure 
   becomes totally reactive.

   In this phase we perform the Local path Repair procedure instead of 
   path Repair using the CRN discovered during the creation of the GA. 
   Path Repair consists of reserving resources for a session in the New 
   path and to tear down the old reservation on the Old path for the 
   same session.

   The following definitions are given:
      - Local Old path is the path between PAR and CRN;
      - Local New path is the path between NAR and CRN;
      - Local Update path is the path between CN and CRN;

   Then, resources must be reserved in the Local New path (Reserve 
   massage), torn down in the Local Old path (Reserve massage with TEAR 
   flag set) and updated in the Local Update path (Reserve massage with 
   REPLACE flag set).
   CRN receives the reserve message from the QNI and in addition sends 
   it towards the QNR and towards the PAR setting TEAR and REPLACE flag 
   as it is explained in the previous paragraph. 



4 Semi-proactive Procedure by the GIST point of view

   The fundamental aim of the GIST protocol is to discover the path 
   that signaled data will follow and to create a GA between the end-
   points of data flow.

   On the basis of what has already been said previously, in networks 
   in which there are MNs it is better to create a proactive GA on all 
   of the Candidate paths.

   The GIST protocol during the creation of the GA takes into 
   consideration also the discovery of the CCRN. The algorithm of the 
   discovery is quite simple thanks to the information contained in the 
   GIST-Query, GIST-Response and GIST-Confirm messages. At the end of 
   the proactive phase there will be therefore, as many GA as there are 
   nodes contained in the CAR list.

   In order to achieve this all the protocol needs is one flag only (M-
   Mobility flag) which indicates to the nodes the particular scenario 
   in which they are working.
   We propose to use one of the reserved bit in GIST Common Header for 
   this flag.

   Moreover, a new TLV object extends those already present in the 
   protocol, in order to help the discovery of the CCRN and the 
   transport of information in this node after it has been 
   individuated.
   The next version of the draft counts on having greater details of 
   this object.



4.1 CCRN e CRN

   Both CCRN and CRN have an important role in the procedures described 
   in this draft.


F.Tommasi, et al.              Expires August 2006               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment       February 2006



   It is potentially possible to discover as many CCNRs as CARs. In the 
   proactive phase, if the MN is the receiver of the data flow, the 
   CCRNs buffer the packets sent to the MN during handover (as 
   described in paragraph 4.2).

   In the reactive phase the CRN will be the principle node and 
   indispensable to the Local path Repair (see paragraph 3.4).



4.2 The new buffering

   If the MN is the data flow receiver, it is necessary to have 
   buffering mechanisms in order to avoid the loss of packets sent to 
   MN during its handover.

   The buffered packets are sent to the MN across the NAR at the end of 
   the handover.

   This type of solutions have already been defined[7]. They guarantee 
   only a minimal loss of packets but not the right QoS during the 
   sending of the buffered packets to the MN.

   We have proposed the inclusion of buffering in the CCRN for various 
   reasons. 
   Above all because the CCRN is the closest node to the MN on the New 
   path in which buffering is possible.
   This means to reduce the total time that the buffered packets use to 
   reach the MN.

   The second motivation for making this choice regards the QoS. The 
   buffered packets, sent on the Local New path after the reservation 
   of resources are treated by the same QoS as other packets from the 
   same flow.

   A CCRN start to buffer packets as soon as it has been discovered
 
   The CRN ends bufferization of packets when it receives from the QNI 
   the Reserve message.

   The other CCRNs stop the bufferization of packets and discard the 
   already buffered packets at the end of timeout.

Internet-Draft      Semi-Proactive QoS Re-establishment       February 2006


   If the MN is the data flow sender it is not necessary to effect any 
   bufferization.



4.3 CCRN Discovery

   If the MN is the data flow sender we are able to discover the CCRN 
   as the first node, NSIS aware, in which the Old and the Candidate 
   path converge.
   If the MN and the receiver of the data flow the CCRN will be the 
   last entity NSIS aware before the Old and the Candidate path 
   diverge.

   As a consequence, the CCRN will be a node on the common trunk between 
   the Old path and the Candidate one.

   The discovery of the CCRN is effected by GIST during the creation of 
   the GA, in fact the protocol, during that phase possesses all the 
   information necessary for the mentioned discovery.

   If in a subnet there are many mobile terminals that communicate with 
   the same CN or with neighbouring CN, the CCNRs of different 
   handovers can coincide in the same node. The node therefore, could 
   be found managing different buffering as well as forwarding packets.
   It is possible to introduce more complex algorithms for choosing 
   CCRNs which take into account the node position and the presence of 
   already opened bufferization.

   Future versions will consider detailed description of the two 
   algorithms and the TLV objects to insert in the GIST messages.



5 Security Considerations

   There is no security consideration.
