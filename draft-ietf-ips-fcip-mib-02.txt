2. Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing FCIP entities, as
   defined in [FCIP] and used in FC fabrics as described in [FCBB2].

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine

Internet Draft                  FCIP  MIB                   October 2002


   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

4. Overview of FCIP management model

   Note that the FCIP Entity is fully described in [FCIP] from a
   functional point of view. A collection of multiple instances of
   FCIP Entities and the corresponding FC Entities, described in [BB2],
   within a single  management entity is referred to as a FCIP device here.
   This section describes FCIP from a management point of view.
 
   The FCIP device provides IP-based interconnection model to interconnect 
   FC fabric elements. In this model, the FCIP devices along with 
   the IP network on which they are running provide a new FCIP transport
   network.

   This IP-based FCIP Interconnection Model supports the following 
   topology:
   o The FCIP-based transport network is formed by interconnecting the
     FCIP-devices.
   o Each FCIP device has one or more FCIP Entities or Instances.
   o Peer FCIP Entities are connected by FCIP Links, attached to
     VE_ports/B_Access.
   o Each FCIP Link contains one or more Data Engines.
   o The FCIP device can work as a standalone box or as part 
     of a FC fabric element. 

   Each FCIP Entity managed by this MIB is referred to as a FCIP Instance.
   The MIB is broken up as follows:

4.1 FCIP Entity Instances Table
   The FCIP Entity table contains information about this entity's existing
   instances of FCIP entities.

4.2 FCIP Link Table
   The FCIP link table contains information about this FCIP device's 
   existing FCIP links.

4.3 FCIP TCP Connection Table
   The FCIP TCP Connection table contains information about existing TCP
   connections. Each FCIP link within a FCIP entity contains one or more
   TCP connections. The FCIP entity employs a Data Engine for each TCP
   connection for handling FC frame encapsulation, de-encapsulation and
   transmission of FCIP frames on the connection.

4.4 FCIP Dynamic Route Table
   The FCIP dynamic route table contains routing information that is
   dynamically discovered by this FCIP device. The FCIP device may use

   the SLPv2 protocol in conjunction with other protocols, such as FSPF,
   to dynamically discover other FCIP entities, and populate this table
   to map destination domains to FCIP Links.

4.5 FCIP Static Route Table
   The FCIP static route table contains routing information that is
   statically configured into this FCIP device by Network Admin.
   In the absence of dynamic discovery of remote FCIP entities, the
   Network Manager will configure remote domains and FCIP Entities
   that are reachable by this device into this table.

4.6 FCIP Discovery Domain Table

   The FCIP Discovery Domain Table maps this device's FCIP Entities into
   FCIP Discovery Domains.

4.7 FCIP Link Error Table
   The FCIP Link Errors Table contains counters that indicate error
   conditions on an FCIP Link.

5. Relationship to other MIBs

   Objects accessible from other MIBs applicable to FCIP devices have not
   been included in this MIB.

5.1 Relationship to the 'TCP' group of MIB-II

   This group is mandatory for all systems which implement TCP. Objects
   relevant to TCP must be obtained from this group.

5.2 Relationship to the 'interfaces' MIB
   
   The 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces.
   Each logical/virtual interface created as an FCIP Link should be
   represented as a row in the ifTable with a unique ifIndex value and a
   value of ifType common to all such FCIP Links.  These are the only
   ifIndex values of relevance to an FCIP Entity because FCIP runs over
   top of TCP/IP.  When an FCIP entity has data to transmit to a peer FCIP
   entity, it gives it to TCP, and TCP formats the data into segments and
   gives them to IP; IP puts the data into datagrams which it sends on
   whatever one or more physical interfaces IP has available.  Therefore,
   only IP, not an FCIP Entity, has knowledge of the ifIndex values for
   physical interfaces. Note that ifStackTable may be used to find the
   physical interface over which an FCIP Link is running.

5.3 Relationship to the Fibre Channel Management MIB

8. Security considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that contain what
   could be considered as sensitive information.  In particular, the
   objects which provide information on identification and network
   topology:

   fcipDeviceWWN
   fcipEntityName
   fcipEntityAddress
   fcipLinkLocalFcipEntityAddress
   fcipLinkRemFcipEntityWWN
   fcipLinkRemFcipEntityAddress
   fcipDynamicRouteTable
   fcipStaticRouteTable
   fcipDiscoveryDomainTable

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt their values when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP
   provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
