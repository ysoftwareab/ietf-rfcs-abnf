Abstract

  The transition from an all IPv4 network to an all IPv6 network
  requires several interim steps, being one of them the evolution of
  current IPv4 dependent protocols to protocols that are independent
  of the type of IP addresses used. Hence, it is hoped that protocols
  will be redesigned and re-implemented to become network address
  independent, or at least to dually support IPv4 and IPv6.
  To achieve that step, it is necessary to survey and document all IPv4
  dependencies experienced by current standards - Full, Draft, and
  Proposed - and Experimental RFCs. Hence, this document describes
  IPv4 addressing dependencies that deployed IETF Application Area
  documented Standards may experience.

1 Introduction

  The exhaustive documentation of IPv4 addresses usage in currently
  deployed IETF documented standards has now been broken
  into seven documents conforming to current IETF main areas -
  Applications, Internet, Operations and Management, Routing, Sub-
  IP, and Transport. A general overview of the documentation, as well
  as followed methodology and historical perspective can be found in    
  [1].
  This document represents one of the seven blocks, and its scope
  is limited to the use of IPv4 addresses in IETF Application Area
  documented Standards.



2 Document Organization

  The remainder sections are organized as follows. Sections 3, 4, 5, and
  6 describe, respectively, the raw analysis of Internet Standards [3]:
  Full, Draft and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs. For
  each section, standards are analysed by their RFC sequential order,
  i.e., from RFC 1 to RFC 3247. Also, the comments presented for
  each RFC are raw in their nature, i.e., each RFC is simply analysed
  in terms of possible IPv4 addressing dependencies. Finally, Section
  7 presents a global overview of the data described in the previous
  sections, and suggests possible future steps.


3 Full Standards

  Internet Full Standards attain the highest level of maturity on
  the standards track process. They are commonly referred to as
  "Standards", and represent fully technical mature specifications,
  widely implemented and used throughout the Internet.

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv4survey-apps-01.txt  February 2003


3.1 RFC821, RFC1869: SMTP Service Extensions

3.1.1 RFC 821

  Section 4.1.2 "Command Syntax" contains the following clear IPv4
  reference:

    "<dotnum> ::= <snum> "." <snum> "." <snum> "." <snum>"

  Also, the following paragraph needs to be re-written, to eliminate
  the explicit reference to a 32-bit ARPA Internet Address in four 
  8-bit fields:

  "Sometimes a host is not known to the translation function and
  communication is blocked. To bypass this barrier two numeric forms
  are also allowed for host 'names'. One form is a decimal integer
  prefixed by a pound sign, "#", which indicates the number is the
  address of the host. Another form is four small decimal integers
  separated by dots and enclosed by brackets, e.g., "[123.255.37.2]".


3.1.2 RFC 1869

    There are no IPv4 dependencies in RFC 1869.

3.2 RFC 822: Standard for the format of ARPA Internet
           text messages

  There are some IPv4 dependencies in RFC 822, which needs to be
  re-written. Section 6.2.3. (Domain Terms) contains the following
  text:

  "A domain-ref must be THE official name of a registry, network,
  or host. It is a symbolic reference, within a name sub-domain. At
  times, it is necessary to bypass standard mechanisms for resolving
  such references, using more primitive information, such as a network
  host address rather than its associated host name.
  To permit such references, this standard provides the domain-literal
  construct. Its contents must conform with the needs of the sub-
  domain in which it is interpreted.
  Domain-literals which refer to domains within the ARPA Internet
  specify 32-bit Internet addresses, in four 8-bit fields noted in

  decimal, as described in Request for Comments #820,"Assigned Numbers."
  For example:
    [10.0.3.19]
  Note: THE USE OF DOMAIN-LITERALS IS STRONGLY
  DISCOURAGED.
  It is permitted only as a means of bypassing temporary system
  limitations,
  such as name tables which are not complete."

3.3 RFC854, RFC855: Telnet Protocol

3.3.1 RFC 854

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in RFC 854.

3.17 RFC 959: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

  Section 4.1.2 (TRANSFER PARAMETER COMMANDS) describes
  the port command using the following format:

  "A port command would be:
  PORT h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv4survey-apps-01.txt  February 2003


  where h1 is the high order 8 bits of the internet host address."

  This is a clear reference to an IPv4 address. In sections 4.2.1 and
  4.2.2, on reply codes, the code:

  "227 Entering Passive Mode (h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2)"

  also needs to be reworked for IPv6 addressing. Also, Section 5.3.2
  (FTP COMMAND ARGUMENTS) contains:

  "<host-number> ::= <number>,<number>,<number>,<number>
  <port-number> ::= <number>,<number><number> ::= any decimal
  integer 1 through 255"

  This needs to be solved to transition to IPv6.

3.18 RFC 974: Mail Routing and the Domain System

  Section Examples uses the well established A records, whose clear
  IPv4 dependency has already been investigated in [2].

3.19 RFC 1350: Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

3.20 RFC 1939: Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3)

4 Draft Standards

  Draft Standards is the nomenclature given to specifications that are
  on the penultimate maturity level of the IETF standards track process.
  They are considered to be final specifications, which may only

  experience changes to solve specific problems found. A specification
  is only considered to be a Draft Standard if there are at least two
  known independent and interoperable implementations. Hence, Draft
  Standards are usually quite mature and widely used.

4.1 RFC 954: NICNAME/WHOIS (NICNAME)

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

4.2 RFC 1184: Telnet Linemode Option (TOPT-LINE)

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

4.3 RFC 1288: The Finger User Information Protocol
      (FINGER)

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

4.4 RFC 1305: Network Time Protocol (Version 3)
      Specification, Implementation

  Section 3.2.1 (Common Variables) provides the following variable
  definitions:

  "Peer Address (peer.peeraddr, pkt.peeraddr), Peer Port
  (peer.peerport,pkt.peerport). These are the 32-bit Internet address
  and 16-bit port number of the peer.
  Host Address (peer.hostaddr, pkt.hostaddr), Host Port (peer.hostport,
  pkt.hostport). These are the 32-bit Internet address and 16-bit port
  number of the host. They are included among the state variables to
  support multi-homing."

  Section 3.4.3 (Receive Procedure) defines the following procedure:

  "The source and destination Internet addresses and ports in the IP
  and UDP headers are matched to the correct peer. If there is no
  match a new instantiation of the protocol machine is created and the
  association mobilized."

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv4survey-apps-01.txt  February 2003


  Section 3.6 (Access Control Issues) proposes a simple authentication
  scheme in the following way:

  "If a more comprehensive trust model is required, the design can
  be based on an access-control list with each entry consisting of
  a 32-bit Internet address, 32-bit mask and three-bit mode. If the
  logical AND of the source address (pkt.peeraddr) and the mask in an
  entry matches the corresponding address in the entry and the mode
  (pkt.mode) matches the mode in the entry, the access is allowed;
  otherwise an ICMP error message is returned to the requestor. Through
  appropriate choice of mask, it is possible to restrict requests
  by mode to individual addresses, a particular subnet or net addresses,
  or have no restriction at all. The access-control list would then 
  serve as a filter controlling which peers could create associations."

Appendix B Section 3 (B.3 Commands) defines the following
command:

  "Set Trap Address/Port (6): The command association identifier,
  status and data fields are ignored. The address and port number for
  subsequent trap messages are taken from the source address and
  port of the control message itself. The initial trap counter for trap
  response messages is taken from the sequence field of the command.
  The response association identifier, status and data fields are not
  significant. Implementations should include sanity timeouts which
  prevent trap transmissions if the monitoring program does not renew
  this information after a lengthy interval."

  The address clearly assumes an IPv4 address. Also, there are
  numerous places in sample code and in algorithms that use the above
  mentioned variables. It seems that there is no reason to modify the
  actual protocol. A small number of text changes and an update
  to implementations, so they can understand both IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses, will suffice to have a NTP version that works on both
  network layer protocols.

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

4.15 RFC 2347: TFTP Option Extension (TFTP-Ext)

  There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

4.16 RFC 2348: TFTP Blocksize Option (TFTP-Blk)

  Section "Blocksize Option Specification" gives the following
  example:

  "For example:
  +---+--¡+-+--¡+-+--¡+-+--¡+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  | 1 | foobar | 0 | octet | 0 | blksize| 0 | 1428 | 0 |
  +---+--¡+-+--¡+-+--¡+-+--¡+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  is a Read Request, for the file named "foobar", in octet (binary)
  transfer mode, with a block size of 1428 octets (Ethernet MTU, less
  the TFTP, UDP and IP header lengths)."

  Clearly, the given blocksize example would not work with IPv6
  header sizes, but it has no practical implications, since larger
  blocksizes are also available.

        Size Options (TFTP-Opt)

  "The host is a domain name of a network host, or its IPv4 address
  as a set of four decimal digit groups separated by ".". Literal IPv6
  addresses are not supported.
  ...
  Note: A suitable representation for including a literal IPv6 address
  as the host part of a URL is desired, but has not yet been determined
  or implemented in practice."

4.20 RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol ¡ HTTP/1.1
       (HTTP)

  Section 3.2.2 (http URL) states:

  "The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the
  HTTP protocol. This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and
  semantics for http URLs.
  http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
  If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics
  are that the identified resource is located at the server listening 
  for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for
  the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). The use of IP addresses
  in URLs SHOULD be avoided whenever possible (see RFC 1900
  [24]). "

  The text is version neutral, but it is unclear whether individual
  implementations will support IPv6 addresses. In fact, the use
  of the ":"separator in IPv6 addresses will cause misinterpretation
  when parsing URI's. There are other discussions regarding a
  server recognizing its own IP addresses, spoofing DNS/IP address
  combinations, as well as issues regarding multiple HTTP servers
  running on a single IP interface. Again, the text is version neutral,
  but clearly, such statements represent implementation issues.


5 Proposed Standards

  Proposed Standards represent initial level documents in the IETF
  standards track. They are stable in terms of design, but do not
  require the existence of implementations. In several cases, these
  specifications are simply proposed as solid technical ideas, to be
  analysed by the Internet community, but are never implemented or
  advanced in the IETF standards' process.

  domain names take the form as described in Section 3.5 of RFC
  1034 [13] and Section 2.1 of RFC 1123 [5]: a sequence of domain
  labels separated by ".", each domain label starting and ending
  with an alphanumerical character and possibly also containing "-"
  characters. The rightmost domain label will never start with a digit,
  though, which syntactically distinguishes all domain names from the
  IP addresses."

  Clearly, this is only valid when using IPv4 addresses. Later in
  Section 5. (BNF for specific URL schemes), there is the following
  text:

  "; URL schemeparts for ip based protocols:
  ip-schemepart = "//" login [ "/" urlpath ]
  login = [ user [ ":" password ] "@" ] hostport
  hostport = host [ ":" port ]
  host = hostname | hostnumber"

  Again, this has also implications in terms of network neutrality.

5.42 RFC 1913: Architecture of the Whois++ Index

  Section 6.5. (Query referral) makes the following statement:

  "When referrals are included in the body of a response to a query,
  each referral is listed in a separate SERVER-TO-ASK block as shown
  below.
  # SERVER-TO-ASK
  Version-number: // version number of index software, used to insure
  compatibility
  Body-of-Query: // the original query goes here
  Server-Handle: // WHOIS++ handle of the referred server
  Host-Name: // DNS name or IP address of the referred server
  Port-Number: // Port number to which to connect, if different from
  the
  // WHOIS++ port number"

  The syntax used does not present specific IPv4 dependencies, but
  implementations should be modified to check, in incoming packets,
  which IP version was used by the original request, so they can
  determine whether or not to to return an IPv6 address.

  time. For example records, IP-addresses of Whois++ servers, the
  Directory of Services server etc.
  A client can itself choose for how long it should cache the
  information. The IP-address of the Directory of Services server
  might not change for a day or two, and neither might any other
  information."

  contains:

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv4survey-apps-01.txt  February 2003


  "An example of cached information that might change is the cached
  hostname, IP-address and portnumber which a client gets back
  in a servers-to-ask response. That information is cached in the
  server since the last poll, which might occurred several weeks ago.
  Therefore, when such a connection fails, the client should fall back
  to use the serverhandle instead, which means that it contacts the
  Directory of Services server and queries for a server with that
  serverhandle. By doing this, the client should always get the last
  known hostname. An algorithm for this might be:
  response := servers-to-ask response from server A
  IP-address := find ip-address for response.hostname in DNS
  connect to ip-address at port response.portnumber
  if connection fails {
    connect to Directory of Services server
    query for host with serverhandle response.serverhandle
    response := response from Directory of Services server
    IP-address := find ip-address for response.hostname in DNS
    connect to ip-address at port response.portnumber
    if connection fails {
      exit with error message
    }
  }
  Query this new server"

  The paragraph does not contain IPv4 specific syntax. Hence, IPv6
  compliance will be implementation dependent.

5.54 RFC 2122: VEMMI URL Specification (VEMMI-

  "The VEMMI URL scheme is used to designate multimedia
  interactive services conforming to the VEMMI standard (ITU/T
  T.107 and ETS 300 709).
  A VEMMI URL takes the form:
  vemmi://<host>:<port>/<vemmiservice>;
  <attribute>=<value>
  as specified in Section 3.1. of RFC 1738. If :<port> is omitted,
  the port defaults to 575 (client software may choose to ignore
  the optional port number in order to increase security). The
  <vemmiservice> part is optional and may be omitted."

  IPv4 dependencies may relate to the possibility of the <host> portion
  to contain an IPv4 address, as defined in RFC 1738 (see section 5.31.
  above). Once the problem is solved in the context of RFC 1738, this

  of dotted decimal IP address notation should only be used in
  environments which have no Domain Name Service.
  Example:
  RESOLVO.NEATO.ORG,128.127.203.63"

  Later, in Section 20.4. (Address Specification in Service Location)
  there is also the following reference to addr-spec:

  "The address specification used in Service Location is:
  <addr-spec> ::= [<user>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>]
  <host> ::= Fully qualified domain name | dotted decimal IP address
  notation
  When no Domain Name Server is available, SAs and DAs must
  use dotted decimal conventions for IP addresses. Otherwise, it is
  preferable to use a fully qualified domain name wherever possible as
  renumbering of host addresses will make IP addresses invalid over
  time."

  The whole Section 21. (Protocol Requirements) defines the
  requirements for each of the elements of this protocol. Several IPv4
  statements are made, but the syntax used is sufficiently neutral to
  apply to the use of IPv6.
  Section 22. (Configurable Parameters and Default Values) states:

  "There are several configuration parameters for Service Location.
  Default values are chosen to allow protocol operation without the
  need for selection of these configuration parameters, but other
  values may be selected by the site administrator. The configurable
  parameters will allow an implementation of Service Location to be
  more useful in a variety of scenarios.
  Multicast vs. Broadcast
  All Service Location entities must use multicast by default. The
  ability to use broadcast messages must be configurable for UAs and
  SAs. Broadcast messages are to be used in environments where
  not all Service Location entities have hardware or software which
  supports multicast.
  Multicast Radius
  Multicast requests should be sent to all subnets in a site. The 
  default multicast radius for a site is 32. This value must be

  configurable. The value for the site's multicast TTL may be obtained 
  DHCP using an option which is currently unassigned."
  Once again, nothing here precludes IPv6. Section 23. (Non-
  configurable Parameters) states:
  "IP Port number for unicast requests to Directory Agents:
  UDP and TCP Port Number: 427
  Multicast Addresses
  Service Location General Multicast Address: 224.0.1.22
  Directory Agent Discovery Multicast Address: 224.0.1.35
  A range of 1024 contiguous multicast addresses for use as Service
  Specific Discovery Multicast Addresses will be assigned by IANA."

  Clearly, the statements above require specifications related to the 
  use of IPv6 multicast addresses with equivalent functionality.

  "Property Name: UID
  Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique
  identifier for the calendar component.
  Value Type: TEXT
  Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
  specified on this property.
  Conformance:       The property MUST be specified in the
  "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY"
  calendar components.
  Description: The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.
  The generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is
  unique. There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish
  this. The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax
  to the [RFC 822] addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness
  is to put the domain name or a domain literal IP address of the host
  on which the identifier was created on the right hand side of the
  "@", and on the left hand side, put a combination of the current
  calendar date and time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-TIME
  value) along with some other currently unique (perhaps sequential)
  identifier available on the system (for example, a process id number).
  Using a date/time value on the left hand side and a domain name or
  domain literal on the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee
  uniqueness since no two hosts should be using the same domain
  name or IP address at the same time. Though other algorithms will
  work, it is RECOMMENDED that the right hand side contain some
  domain identifier (either of the host itself or otherwise) such that 
  the generator of the message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness
  of the left hand side within the scope of that domain."

  Although the above does not explicitly state the use of IPv4
  addresses, it addresses the explicit use of RFC 822, which is IPv4
  dependent, as already described in section 3.4. To be IPv6 compliant
  it should instead explicitly disallow the use of IPv4 addresses.

6 Experimental RFCs

  Experimental RFCs belong to the category of "non-standard"
  specifications. This group involves specifications considered "off-
  track", e.g., specifications that haven't yet reach an adequate
  standardization level, or that have been superseded by more recent
  specifications.
  Experimental RFCs represent specifications that are currently part of
  some research effort, and that are often propriety in nature, or used
  in limited arenas. They are documented to the Internet community
  in order to allow potential interoperability or some other potential
  useful scenario. In a few cases, they are presented as alternatives to
  the mainstream solution of an acknowledged problem.

6.42 RFC 2307: An Approach for Using LDAP as a
       Network Information Service (LDAP-NIS)

  This protocol assumes IPv4 addressing in its schema, as shown in
  Section 3. (Attribute definitions):

  The document does try to provide some IPv6 support as in Section
  5.4. (Interpreting Hosts and Networks):

  "Hosts with IPv6 addresses MUST be written in their "preferred"
  form as defined in section 2.2.1 of [RFC1884], such that all
  components of the address are indicated and leading zeros are
  omitted. This provides a consistent means of resolving ipHosts by
  address."

  However, the defined format mentioned above has been replaced,
  hence it is no longer valid.

  the following statement:

  "SIGNATURE is a COUNTSTR [3.1] which holds the HMAC-MD5
  digest (see
  [RFC 2104]), with a B value of 64, of the following elements, each
  of which is digested in its "on the wire" format, including 
  transmitted padding if any is covered by a field's associated LENGTH:
  IP SRC ADDR [4 octets]
  IP SRC PORT [2 octets]

6.58 RFC 3088: OpenLDAP Root Service An
        experimental LDAP referral service

  Section 5. (Using the Service) states:
  "The service supports LDAPv3 and LDAPv2+ [LDAPv2+] clients
  over
  TCP/IPv4. Future incarnations of this service may support TCP/IPv6
  or other transport/internet protocols."


7 Summary of Results

  From the initial survey of 262 RFCs, 17 were identified as having
  some form of IPv4 dependency. Results are broken down as follows:
  Standards: 4 of 24, or 16.67%
  Draft Standards: 3 of 20, or 15.00%
  Proposed Standards: 5 of 160, or 3.13%
  Experimental RFCs: 5 of 58, or 8.62%
  Of the 17 identified, several require no action, either because they
  document outdated and unused protocols, or because they document
  protocols that are still being updated by the appropriate working
  groups. Additionally, there are many instances of standards that
  should be updated, but do not cause any operational impact if
  they are not. The remaining instances are documented below.
  The author has attempted to organize the results in a format
  that allows easy reference to other protocol designers.         The
  following recommendations uses the documented terms "MUST",
  "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" described in RFC 2119. They should only be
  interpreted in the context of RFC 2119 when they appear in all
  caps. That is, the word "should" in the previous SHOULD NOT be
  interpreted as in RFC 2119. The assignment of these terms has been
  based entirely on the authors perceived needs for updates and should
  not be taken as an official statement.

7.1 Full Standards

7.1.1 RFC 959: STD 9 File Transfer Protocol

  Problems have already been fixed in [6].

7.1.2 RFC 821: STD 10 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

  The use of literal IP addresses as part of email addresses,
  i.e., phil@10.10.10.10, is depreciated and therefore additional
  specifications for using literal IPv6 addresses SHOULD NOT be
  defined.

7.1.3 RFC 822: STD 11 Standard for the format of ARPA
       Internet Text Messages

  See section 3.2.

7.1.4 RFC 1305: STD 12 Network Time Protocol

  As documented in Section 3.19. above, there are too many
  specific references to the use of 32-bit IPv4 addresses. An updated
  specification to support NTP over IPv6 packets MUST be created.

7.2 Draft Standards

7.2.1 RFC 1305: Network Time Protocol (NTP)

  See Section 7.1.4.

7.2.2 RFC 2396: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Syntax

  URI's allow the literal use of IPv4 addresses but have no specific
  recommendations on how to represent literal IPv6 addresses. This
  problem has already been addressed in [4].

7.2.3 RFC 2616: HTTP

  HTTP allows the literal use of IPv4 addresses, but has no specific
  recommendations on how to represent literal IPv6 addresses. This
  problem has already been addressed in [4].

7.3 Proposed Standards

7.3.1 RFC 946: Telnet Terminal LOC

  There is a dependency in the definition of the TTYLOC Number
  which would require an updated version of the protocol. However,
  since this functionality is of marginal value today, a newer version
  MAY be created.

7.3.3 RFC 2384: POP3 URL Scheme

  POP URL IPv4 dependencies have already been addressed in [4].


7.3.4 RFC 2608:SLP v2

  The problems of this specification have already been addressed in
  [5].


7.3.5 RFC 3017: XML DTP For Roaming Access Phone Books

  Extensions SHOULD be defined to support IPv6 addresses.

7.4 Experimental RFCs

7.4.1 RFC 1235:The Coherent File Distribution Protocol

  This protocol relies on IPv4 and a new protocol standard SHOULD
  NOT be produced.


7.4.2 RFC 1459: IRC Protocol

  This protocol relies on IPv4 and a new protocol standard SHOULD
  be produced.

7.4.3 RFC 1986: Simple File Transfer Using Enhanced TFTP

  This protocol relies on IPv4 and a new protocol standard MAY be
  produced.


7.4.4 RFC 2090: TFTP Multicast Option

  This protocol relies on IPv4 IGMP Multicast and a new protocol
  standard MAY be produced.

  outdated format for IPv6 addresses. A new specification MAY be
  produced.
