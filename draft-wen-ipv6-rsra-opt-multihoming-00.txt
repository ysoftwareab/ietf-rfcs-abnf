Internet-Draft    Multi-homing option for RS/RA messages      March 2006


Abstract

   This document makes an extension to the standard RS/RA messages for
   IPv6 network to solve some problems occurring in multi-homing
   evironment. A new options, that is, Multi-homing Information option 
   is defined to help host do network selection and prefix selection.

1. Introduction

   Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SAAC)[1] is a very important 
   feature for IPv6 technology. In the standard IPv6 stateless 
   configuration, a router sends periodical as well as solicited Router
   Advertisement (RA) messages out its advertising interfaces. When an 
   interface of an IPv6 host becomes enabled, the host may be unwilling 
   to wait for the next unsolicited RA message to locate default routers
   or learn prefixes, it will transimit Router Solicitation (RS) message
   to request RA message.
   
   IPv6 multi-homing environment is used to described this kind of IPv6
   site that phsically or logically connects to more than one IP Service
   Provider (ISP). Multi-homing can be used for the purposes of 
   redundancy, load-balancing, operational policy or cost. If the IPv6
   multi-homing site uses provider-assigned address prefixes for every 
   host's SAAC within the site, the host can obtain these prefixes 
   assigend by different ISPs from RA messages, and then form its IPv6 
   global addresses. However, most ISPs may use ingress filtering, i.e.,
   the ISP's edge router at the boundary of the chosen multi-homing site
   will check the source address of the packets routed from multi-homing
   site whether the prefix of its source address is assigned by the ISP,
   if not, the packets will be discarded. How to help host implement 
   exit router selection and the associated prefix or address selection 
   must be investigated.
   
   In the IPv6 multi-homing site, some hosts/terminals may want to 
   connect to some specified ISPs. When these hosts/terminals send out
   RS messages, it's not necessary for all the edge router connecting to
   this site to respond with its RA message, and it's a better way that
   only the edge router of the specified ISP responds this RS message
   with an appropriate RA message. This can be called network sevice 
   selection.
   
   This document defines an option, i.e., Multi-homing Information

Internet-Draft    Multi-homing option for RS/RA messages      March 2006


   option for Router Solicitation/Router Advertisement(RS/RA) messages 
   which can be used to solve the problems above-mentiioned.

2. RS/RA message extension

   To decrease the solicited RA messages, RS message must contain some
   information to help router make the appropriate decision whether it 
   should an approriate RA message to respond. In addition, RA message 
   must contain some information related to the prefix assigned by the 
   corresponding ISP, thus hosts can easily find the correct exit router
   , the associated prefix and also form their correct IPv6 addresses 
   that should be used as source address for outgoing packets. Multi-
   homing Information option is defind for this purpose.

2.1 Multi-homing Information option
   
   Multi-homing Information option is used for both RS message and RA 
   message. 
   
   In upstream RS message, it can contain host's network 
   service selection infromation, for example, it can have the name of
   the ISP subscribered by the host, or vendor class identifier, or 
   other information. The option is used in RS message, and the 
   corresponding router can respond it with an appropriate RA message 
   containing the correct prefix information.
   
   In the downstream RA message, this option appears immediately prior 
   to the corresponding Prefix Information option, i.e., in a pair form
   <Multi-homing Information option, Prefix Information option>. This 
   option is used to indicate that some specific ISP assigns the prefix 
   in the immediately following Prefix Information option. It can help 
   the host to do correct exit router selection and prefix selection.

      Length         8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option 
                     (including the type and length fields) is in units 
                     of 8 octets.  The value 0 is invalid.  Nodes MUST 
                     silently discard an ND packet that contains an 
                     option with length zero.

      Sub-option indicator
                     Each bit of this field is used for indicating some
                     specific sub-option is included in this Multi-
                     homing Information option. The value 0 is invalid. 
                     Nodes MUST silently discard an ND packet that 
                     contains an option with length zero.
                     Currently only the least 5 bits are defined (refer
                     to subsection 2.1.1). 

      Multi-homing Data
                     This field is used to contain the information 
                     related to multi-homing (e.g., the name of some 
                     specified ISP, or the vendor class identifier 
                     information, or any other information) for network 
                     service selection in RS message and for prefix/exit
                     router selection in RA message. It can contain more
                     than one Multi-homing-subopiton if required (the 
                     sub-options are shown in subsection 2.1.2).

      Pad            Variable-length field. This field is used to align 
                     Multi-homing Information option in units of 8 
                     octets. The content of Pad field is 0. That is, 
                     using the minimum octets with 0 to make sure the 
                     length of the whole option to be in units of 8 
                     octets.

   Description
                     When this option exists in RS and RA message for 
                     different purpose. In RS message, it help router 
                     decide whether it should respond. In RA message, it
                     help host do correct selection of prefix exit 
                     router: the host can record each prefix and its 
                     associated information (e.g., the ISP that assigns 
                     this prefix, and the link-local address of the exit
                     router that advertises this RA) and form feasible
                     global IPv6 address as source address, and then
                     forward parckets to the apporiate ISP.

                     When Sub-Type is 4 or 5, the Sub-option Data 
                     field contains the corresponding address from the 
                     specific ISP, i.e., the DNS server address and SIP 
                     server address, respectively. It can simplify the 
                     process of host obtaining the addresses of DNS 
                     server and/or SIP server, for these information is 
                     piggyback on SAAC.
                     
   Description
                     The sub-options can be used in a combination if 
                     needed. The router, which can identify the sub-
                     options and find the matchings in its own data base
                     , will respond with corresponding information in a
                     RA message. The router, which can not indentify the
                     multi-homing infomration option will ignore this
                     option.

                     In additon, any other new sub-options can be 
                     defined to make new extention. For example, it can 
                     also be extended for access network to carry 
                     authentication information when access network 
                     requires simpler authentication without very strict
                     secure request. For this case, to make the 
                     information far away from attack or snooping, IPv6
                     Encapsulating Security Payload Header option can be
                     used.

        Figure 1: IPv6 multi-homing site with two exit routers

   Figure 1 illustrates an IPv6 multi-homing site with two exit routers.
   In this scenario, the site is physcially connected to more than one 
   ISP core network through different edge router of the ISPs. Each ISP
   has its own DNS server and ISP server. The edge router will advertise
   RA message containing corresponding informtion. For the multi-homing 
   site, the edge routers of ISPs are its exit router. Normally, the 
   router advertises periodic RA message with Prefix Information option
   and Multi-homing Information option only including ISP name 
   sub-options. When the interface of host is enabled, it will send out 
   a RS message which will contain some inforamtion that the host shows 
   interest in. If it wants to know other information (e.g., SIP server,
   DNS server), router will repond with corresponding information.
   Figure 2 shows the procedure of stateless auto-configuration in this 
   multi-homing environment. Here, we assume the interface of host 1 is 
   enabled, it wants service from ISP1, and in addition it wants to 
   obtain the DNS server address of ISP1.

Internet-Draft    Multi-homing option for RS/RA messages      March 2006


   The procedure consists of the following steps: 
     
   Step (a) : IPv6 Host1 sends RS (Router Solicitation) message
              to get RA message. This RS message contains Multi-homing 
              information option for ISP selection and configuration:
              ISP name sub-option with ISP1 name, and DNS server option
              with 0 filled in Sub-option Data field. This RS message 
              will reach to all the edge routers that connect to this 
              multi-homing site.
    
   Step (b) : According to the ISP name sub-option in the Multi-homing
              Information option, the edge router 1 of ISP1 knows that
              it should provide the appropriate information to respond
              this RS message: Prefix information, and the requested DNS
              server address. So it forms the RA message with correct
              <Multi-homing Information option, Prefix Information 
              option> pair.The Multi-homing Information option contains
              ISP name and DNS server address. Host 1 can obtain its  
              desired prefix information and the exact associated exit 
              router (its address is in the source address of RA message
              ). Then it can construct its IPv6 address via the method 
              in [1].

              Note: Though the edge router 2 of ISP2 has received the RS 
              message too, it will not respond with a RA message because
              it knows the host is soliciting information from ISP1.

   Figure 3 illustrates the IPv6 access network with multi-homing
   environment via connecting to multiple ISPs. RS/RA messages are 
   running between routed-CPE and hosts. The routed-CPE can obtain
   different prefix from the edge router of each ISP connecting to the 
   access network. For the subscriber network, it's logically multi-
   homing. Routed-CPE must record the mapping information that some 
   specific prefix is obtained from the specific edge router from the 
   specific ISP.

Internet-Draft    Multi-homing option for RS/RA messages      March 2006

   
   Step (a) : IPv6 host sends RS message to solicite RA message. This RS
              message inlcudes Multi-homing Information option with ISP
              name sub-option.
    
   Step (b) : Routed CPE receives RS message. If the gateway hasn't
              obtained a prefix from desired ISP, it will request prefix
              delegation from desired ISP via DHCP or RADIUS or any
              other methods. 
   
   Step (c) : Routed-CPE advertises the appropriate RA message based 
              on the RS message to host. The RA message contains  
              the appropriate multi-homing with ISP name and Prefix 
              Information option. Then the host can select the 
              appropriate prefix according to the ISP name to perform 
              stateless address autoconfiguration. In addition, routed-
              CPE can know the global address of each edge router that
              connects to it. Then it can contain the edge-router
              address in Multi-homing Information option. Thus the host
              in the subscriber network can use Type 0 Routing Header[2]
              for fast forwarding the packets to the desird ISP.
   
   In this scenario, since the routed-CPE has recorded the mapping of 
   prefix information and the ISP's edge router, if it addes function of
   forward the outgoing packets from the subscriber network based on the
   indiation of the source addresses (i.e., if the packet's source 
   address is in the domain of the prefix that is assigned ISP1, the 
   packet must be forwarded to the edge router of ISP1), it's not 
   necessary for host to use Type 0 Routing Header. 
    
   This procedure is also applicable for access node is a layer3 device
   while CPE is a layer2 device. For this case, RS/RA is running between
   access node and hosts.

3.3 Scenario 3: Layer2 access network and layer2 CPE in subscriber 
    network

   In this scenario, the network architecture resembles the one in 
   Figure 3 except that a layer2 CPE (or bridged-CPE) replacs the 
   layer3 CPE (or routed-CPE) in the subscriber network. Access node is 
   still a layer 2 device. Here, RS/RA messages are run between hosts/
   terminals and the edge routers. Figure 5 shows the procedure of SAAC
   for this scenario.

   The procedure consists of the following steps: 
     
   Step (a) : IPv6 Host sends RS message to get RA message. This RS 
              message network selection information in Multi-homing
              Information option.

   Step (b) : Base on the information in Multi-homing Information option
              , layer 2 access node can forward this RS to the correct
              edge router of the desired ISP without sending it to the 
              router that will not respond this RS.
   
   Step (c) : Edge router forms the appropriate RA message according to 
              the RS message. The RA message will containing the 
              appropriate <Multi-homing Information option, Prefix 
              Information option>.
   
   Step (d) : Access node relays the RA message to the corresponding 
              subscriber network. Then the host can select the 
              appropriate prefix according to the ISP name to perform 
              stateless address autoconfiguration.
