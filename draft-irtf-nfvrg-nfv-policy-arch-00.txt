       Policy Architecture and Framework for NFV Infrastructures
                  draft-irtf-nfvrg-nfv-policy-arch-00


Abstract

   A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support NFV
   environments, where policies are used to enforce business rules and
   to specify resource constraints in a number of subsystems. This
   document approaches the policy framework and architecture from the
   perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services
   involving multiple subsystems. The framework extends beyond common
   orchestration constraints across compute, network, and storage
   subsystems to include energy conservation. This document also
   analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, policy actions
   and translations, policy conflict detection and resolution,
   interactions among policies engines, and a hierarchical policy
   architecture/framework to address the demanding and growing
   requirements of NFV environments, that could also be applicable to
   cloud infrastructures in general.

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV      August 5, 2015


1. Introduction

   This document discusses the policy architecture and framework to
   support Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [3] infrastructures. In
   these environments, policies are used to enforce business rules and
   to specify resource constraints, e.g., energy constraints, in a
   number of subsystems, e.g., compute, storage, network, and etc., and
   across subsystems. These subsystems correspond to the different
   "infrastructure domains" identified by the NFV ISG Infrastructure
   Working Group [6][7].

   The current work in the area of policy for NFV is mostly considered
   in the framework of general cloud services, and typically focused on
   individual subsystems and addressing very specific use cases or
   environments. For example, [3] addresses network subsystem policy for
   network virtualization, [14] and [15] are open source projects in the
   area of network policy as part of the OpenDaylight [16] software
   defined networking (SDN) controller framework, [13] specifies an
   information model for network policy, [9] focuses on placement and
   migration policies for distributed virtual computing, [18] is an open
   source project proposal in OpenStack [17] to address policy for
   general cloud environments.

   This document approaches policy, policy framework, and policy
   architecture for NFV services from the perspective of overall
   orchestration requirements for services involving multiple
   subsystems, and can be applied to the general case of any cloud-
   based service. The analysis extends beyond common orchestration
   constraints across compute, network, and storage subsystems to also
   include energy conservation constraints applicable to NFV and other
   environments. The analysis in this document also extends beyond a
   single virtual Point of Presence (vPoP) or administrative domain to
   include multiple data centers and networks forming hierarchical
   domain architectures [8]. The focus of this document is not general
   policy theory, which has already been intensively studied and
   documented on numerous publications over the past 10 to 15 years (see
   [13], [21], [12], [22], and [1] to name a few). This document's
   purpose is to discuss and document a policy architecture that uses
   known policy concepts and theories to address the unique requirements
   of NFV services including multiple vPoPs and networks forming
   hierarchical domain architectures [8].

   With the above goals, this document analyses policy scope, global
   versus local policies, policy actions and translations of actions,
   policy conflict detection and resolution, the interactions among
   policies engines from the different vPoPs and network subsystems,
   demanding and growing requirements of NFV environments.

2. Policy Intent Statement versus Subsystem Actions and Configurations

   Policies define which states of deployment are in compliance, and, by
   logic negation, which ones are not. The compliance statement in a
   policy may define specific actions, e.g., "a given customer is [not
   allowed to deploy VNF X]", where VNF refers to a Virtual Network
   Function, or quasi-specific actions, e.g., "a given customer [must be
   given platinum treatment]." Quasi-specific actions differ from the
   specific ones in that the former requires an additional level of
   translation or interpretation, which will depend on the subsystems
   where the policy is being evaluated, while the latter does not
   require further translation or interpretation.

   In the previous examples, "VNF X" defines a specific VNF type, i.e.,
   "X" in this case, while "platinum treatment" could be translated to
   an appropriate resource type depending on the subsystem. For example,
   in the compute subsystem this could be translated to servers of a
   defined minimum performance specification, while in the network
   subsystem this could be translated to a specific Quality of Service
   (QoS) level treatment.

   The actions defined in a policy may be translated to subsystem
   configurations. For example, when "platinum treatment" is translated
   to a specific QoS level treatment in a networking subsystem, one of
   the outcomes (there can be multiple ones) of the policy could be the
   configuration of network elements (physical or virtual) to mark that
   customer's traffic to a certain DSCP (DiffServ Code Point) level
   (Figure 1). Some may refer to the QoS configuration above as a policy
   in itself, e.g., [21], [22], [2], and [12]. In this document, such
   domain configurations are called policy enforcement technologies to
   set them apart from the actual policy intent, e.g., "a given customer
   must be given platinum treatment" as in the above example.

   Describing intent using a high-level policy language instead of
   directly describing configuration details allows for the decoupling
   of the desired intent from the actual configurations, which are
   subsystem dependent, as shown in the previous example (Figure 1). The
   translation of a policy into appropriate subsystem configurations
   requires additional information that is usually subsystem and
   technology dependent. Therefore, policies should not be written in
   terms of policy enforcement technologies. Policies should be
   translated at the subsystems using the appropriate policy provides a
   few examples where the policy "a given customer must be given
   platinum treatment" is translated to appropriate configurations at
   the respective subsystems.

   The above may sound like a discussion about "declarative" versus
   "imperative" policies. We are actually postulating that "imperative

   policy" is just a derived subsystem configuration using an
   appropriate policy enforcement technology to support an actually
   intended policy.

3. Global vs Local Policies

   Some policies may be subsystem specific in scope, while others may
   have broader scope and interact with multiple subsystems. For
   example, a policy constraining certain customer types (or specific
   customers) to only use certain server types for VNF or Virtual
   Machine (VM) deployment would be within the scope of the compute
   subsystem. A policy dictating that a given customer type (or specific
   customers) must be given "platinum treatment" could have different
   implications on different subsystems. As shown in Figure 1, that
   "platinum treatment" could be translated to servers of a given
   performance specification in a compute subsystem and storage of a
   given performance specification in a storage subsystem.

   Policies with broader scope, or global policies, would be defined
   outside affected subsystems and enforced by a global policy engine
   (Figure 2), while subsystem-specific policies or local policies,
   would be defined and enforced at the local policy engines of the
   respective subsystems.

              Figure 2: Global versus Local Policy Engines


   So far, we have referenced compute, network, and storage as
   subsystems examples. However, the following subsystems may also
   support policy engines and subsystem specific policies:

      - SDN Controllers, e.g., OpenDaylight [16].
      - OpenStack [17] components such as, Neutron, Cinder, Nova, and
      etc.
      - Directories, e.g., LDAP, ActiveDirectory, and etc.
      - Applications in general, e.g., standalone or on top of
      OpenDaylight or OpenStack.
      - Physical and virtual network elements, e.g., routers, firewalls,
      application delivery controllers (ADCs), and etc.
      - Energy subsystems, e.g., OpenStack Neat [19].

   Therefore, a policy framework may involve a multitude of subsystems.
   Subsystems may include other lower level subsystems, e.g., Neutron
   [20] would be a lower level subsystem in the OpenStack subsystem. In
   other words, the policy framework is hierarchical in nature, where
   the policy engine of a subsystem may be viewed as a higher level
   policy engine by lower level subsystems. In fact, the global policy

   engine in Figure 2 could be the policy engine of a Data Center
   subsystem and multiple Data Center subsystems could be grouped in a
   region containing a region global policy engine. In addition, one
   could define regions inside regions, hierarchically, as shown in
   Figure 3.

   Metro and wide-area network (WAN) used to interconnect data centers
   would also be independent subsystems with their own policy engines.

5. Policy Conflicts and Resolution

   Policies should be stored in databases accessible by the policy
   engines. For example, the local policies defined for the Compute
   subsystem in Figure 2 would be stored in a database accessible by the
   local policy engine in that subsystem.

   As a new policy is added to a subsystem, the subsystem's policy
   engine should perform conflict checks. For example, a simple conflict
   would be created if a new policy states that "customer A must not be
   allowed to use VNF X", while an already existing policy states that
   "customer A is allowed to use VNF X". In this case, the conflict
   should be detected and an appropriate policy conflict resolution
   mechanism should be initiated.

   The nature of the policy conflict resolution mechanism would depend
   on how the new policy is being entered into the database. If an
   administrator is manually attempting to enter that policy, the
   conflict resolution could entail a warning message and rejection of
   the new policy. The administrator would then decide whether or not to
   replace the existing policy with the new one.

   When policies are batched for later inclusion in the database, the
   administrator should run a preemptive conflict resolution check on
   those policies before committing to include them in the database at a
   future time. However, running a preemptive conflict resolution check
   does not guarantee that there will be no conflicts at the time the
   batched policies are actually included in the database, since other
   policies could have been added in the interim that cause conflicts
   with those batched policies.

   To avoid conflicts between batched policies waiting for later
   inclusion in the database and new policies being immediately added to
   the database, one could run a preemptive conflict resolution check
   against database policies and also batched policies every time new
   policies are added to the database. However, this may not be
   sufficient in case of separate administrative domains. A region
   administration could define batched polices to be pushed to the
   Compute subsystem of a Data Center at a later time. However, the
   Compute subsystem may be a separate administrative domain from that
   of the region administrative domain. In this case, the Compute
   subsystem may not be allowed to run preemptive policy conflict checks
   against the batched policies defined at the region administrative
   domain. Thus, there is a need for a reactive policy conflict
   resolution mechanism besides preemptive techniques.

   The above discussions implicitly assumed that policies are
   individually evaluated for conflicts and individually committed

   without regard to other policies. However, a set of policies could be
   labeled as part of a same "Commit Group", where the whole set of
   policies in the Commit Group must be committed for a desired result
   to be obtained. In this case, the conflict resolution mechanism would
   need to verify that none of the policies in the Commit Group
   conflicts with currently committed policies before the Commit Group
   is added (in other words, committed) to the policy database.

   The Commit Group conflict detection mechanism and subsequent addition
   to the database should be implemented as an atomic process, i.e., no
   changes to the policy database should be allowed by other processes
   until either the whole Commit Group is checked and committed or a
   conflict is detected and the process stopped, to avoid multiple
   writers issues.

   The above described atomic Commit Group conflict detection and policy
   commit mechanism would eliminate the need for  Commit Group rollback.
   A rollback could be required if policies in a Commit Group were to be
   checked for conflicts and committed one by one, since the detection
   of a subsequent policy conflict in the Commit Group would require the
   rollback of previously committed policies in that group. 

6. Policy Pub/Sub Bus

   In the previous section, we considered policy conflicts within a same
   level subsystem. For example, new local policies added to the Compute
   subsystem conflicting with existing local policies at that subsystem.
   However, more subtle conflicts are possible between global and local
   policies.

   A global policy may conflict with subsystems' local policies.
   Consider the following Compute subsystem local policy: "Platinum
   treatment must be provided using server of type A."

   The addition of the Global policy "Platinum treatment must be
   provided using server subtype A-1" would intrude into the Compute
   subsystem by redefining the type of server to be used for a
   particular service treatment. While one could argue that such global
   policy should not be permitted, this is an event that requires
   detection and proper resolution. A possible resolution is for the
   Compute subsystem to import the more restrictive policy into its
   local database. The original local policy would remain in the
   database as is along with the new restrictive policy. The local
   policy engine would then enforce the more restricted form of the
   policy after this policy change, which could make already existing
   resource allocations non-compliant and requiring corrective actions,
   e.g., Platinum treatment being currently provided by a server of type
   A instead of a server of type A-1.

   If the new Global policy read "Platinum treatment must be provided
   using server of types A or B" instead, the Compute subsystem would
   not need to do anything different, since the Compute subsystem has a
   more restrictive local policy in place, i.e., "Platinum treatment
   must be provided using server of type A."

   The above examples demonstrate the need for subsystems to subscribe
   to policy updates at the Global policy level. A policy
   publication/subscription (pub/sub) bus would be required as shown in
   Figure 4.

   A policy conflict may force policies to change scope. Consider the
   following existing policies in a Data Center:

   Compute subsystem policy: "Platinum treatment requires a server of

   type A or B."

   Storage subsystem policy: "Platinum treatment requires a server
   storage of type X or Y."

   Now consider the outcome of adding the following new Global policy:
   "Platinum treatment requires a server of type A when storage of type
   X is used or a server of type B when storage of type Y is used."

   This new Global policy intrudes into the Compute and Storage
   subsystems. Again, one could argue that such global policy should not
   be permitted. Nevertheless, this is an event that would require
   detection and proper resolution. This Global policy causes a conflict
   because the Compute and Storage subsystems can no longer
   independently define whether to use a server of type A or B or
   storage of type X or Y, respectively. If the Compute subsystem
   selects server of type A for a customer and the Storage subsystem
   selects storage of type Y for that same customer service the Global
   policy is violated. In conclusion, if such global policy is
   permitted, the Compute and Storage subsystems can no longer make such
   selections. A possible conflict resolution is for the Compute and
   Storage subsystems to relegate policy enforcement for such resources
   to the Global policy engine. In this example, the Global Policy
   engine would need to coordinate with the Compute and Storage
   subsystems the selection of appropriate resource types to satisfy
   that policy.

   That suggests that the policy pub/sub bus should in fact be an
   integral part of the northbound service interfaces (NBI) of the
   subsystems in the hierarchy. Such issue was analyzed in [8], where
   the concepts of service capability, service availability, and service
   instantiation were introduced to enable a higher-level subsystem to
   properly select services and resources from lower-level subsystems to
   satisfy existing policies.

   The above example demonstrates again the need for subsystems to
   subscribe to policy updates at the higher policy level (the Global
   policy level in this example) as shown in Figure 4.

   If, as demonstrated, a Global policy may "hijack" or "nullify" local
   policies of subsystems, what exactly makes the scope of a policy
   local versus global then?

   Proposition: A Local Policy does not affect the compliance state
   imposed by global Policies or the local policies of other subsystems.

   The above non-exhaustive examples demonstrate that global and local
   policies may conflict in subtle ways. Policy conflicts will also

   policy framework requires a policy pub/sub bus between all levels to
   allow for conflict detection, conflict information propagation, and
   conflict resolution (Figure 5).

7. Examples

7.1 Establishment of a Multipoint Ethernet Service

   Consider a service provider with an NFV infrastructure (NFVI) with
   multiple vPoPs, where each vPoP is a separate administrative domain.
   A customer "Z" requests the creation of a "multipoint Silver Ethernet
   service" between three of its sites, which are connected to service
   provider's vPoPs A, B, and C. The customer request is carried out
   using a service provider self-service web portal, which offers
   customers multiple service type options, e.g., point-to-point and
   multipoint Ethernet services, and multiple service levels per service
   type, e.g., Platinum, Gold, and Silver Ethernet services, where the
   different service levels may represent different service
   specifications in terms of QoS, latency, and etc. The web portal
   relays the request to a service provider's OSS/BSS. The service
   request is stored as a service policy that reads as: "multipoint
   Silver Ethernet service between vPoPs A, B, and C for customer Z".

   The OSS/BSS subsystem communicates the service request and
   requirements as a policy to a global NFV Orchestrator (NFVO)
   subsystem. The service provider's vPoP NFV infrastructure
   architecture may vary depending on the size of each vPoP and other
   specific needs of the service provider. For example, a vPoP may have
   a local NFVO subsystem and one or more local Virtual Infrastructure
   Manager (VIM) subsystems or it may simply have a VIM, but no local
   NFVO subsystem. For simplicity of exposition, assume that the service
   provider has a VIM and no NFVO per vPoP (as in Figure 6). In this
   case, the global NFVO subsystem communicates the service request and
   requirements as a policy to the VIMs of vPoPs A, B, and C.

   At each vPoP, the local VIM will carry out the requested service
   policy based on the local configuration of respective subsystems and
   current availability of resources. For example, Silver service type,
   as specified in the policy, may translate in vPoP A to use a specific
   vCPE VNF type, say vCPE_X, while Silver service type in vPoP B may
   translate to a different vCPE VNF type, say vCPE_Y, due to local
   subsystem configurations (refer to Section 2 for a discussion on
   subsystem actions and configurations). Similarly, the local VIM
   interaction with the vPoP's compute, network, and storage subsystems
   may lead to local configurations of these subsystems driven by the
   translation of the policy by the respective subsystems (see Section 3
   for a discussion on global versus local policies).

   The global NFVO subsystem would potentially communicate the service
   policy to a WAN infrastructure management (WIM) subsystem (not shown
   in Figure 6), to provision a multipoint Silver Ethernet service
   between vPoPs A, B, and C. The WIM subsystem could oversee a

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV      August 5, 2015


   hierarchy of other subsystems, e.g., SDN multi-domain architecture of
   controllers deployed as a hierarchy of network regions (see [8]).
   Network subsystems would translate the Silver type requirement to a
   local configuration (again, refer to Section 2 for a discussion on
   subsystem actions and configurations).

   As depicted in Figure 6, service policy communications should employ
   a policy pub/sub bus between the subsystems' policy engines in the
   policy hierarchy (see Section 6 for a discussion on policy pub/sub
   bus). The global NFVO subsystem should have visibility into the
   policies defined locally at each vPoP to be able to detect any
   potential global policy conflicts, e.g., a local vPoP administrator
   could add a local policy that violates or conflicts with a global
   policy. In addition, the global NFVO subsystem would benefit from
   being able to import the currently configured services at each vPoP.
   For example, each vPoP could publish a table of currently configured
   services. The global NFVO would use such information to monitor
   global policy conformance and also to facilitate detection of policy
   violations when new global policies are created, e.g., a global level
   administrator is about to add a new global policy that, if committed,
   would make certain already configured services a violation of the
   policy. The publication of subsystem service tables for consumption
   by a global policy engine is a concept used in the Congress [18]
   OpenStack [17] project.

   In the hierarchical policy framework described in this document, a
   subsystem's currently configured services table could be published to
   higher tier policy engines using the policy pub/sub bus. The
   subsystem's currently configured services table would describe
   configured services based on the configured policy name space for the
   respective policy pub/sub bus. The name space of a policy pub/sub bus
   refers to the name space available to communicate policies between
   the subsystems connected to the particular policy pub/sub bus. In
   this example, Ethernet services use the name space "Platinum",
   "Gold", and "Silver". A policy can then specify Silver Ethernet
   service. The policy name space would be an attribute associated with
   a particular policy pub/sub bus and should be pre-defined/pre-
   configured in the respective subsystems for each policy pub/sub bus.

   Note that in a hierarchical policy framework a policy engine may use
   more than one policy pub/sub bus, e.g., a policy pub/sub bus to
   communicate with higher tier policy engines and another policy
   pub/sub bus to communicate with lower tier policy engines. For
   example, Figure 6 shows a policy pub/sub bus between the global NFVO
   subsystem and the vPoPs. Each vPoP could have an internal hierarchy
   of policy engines, e.g., VIM policy engine communicating with network
   (e.g., SDN controller), compute (VM orchestration), and storage
   subsystems' policy engines.

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV      August 5, 2015


   The amount of information that would be reported by a subsystem's
   currently configured services table would then depend on the pre-
   defined name space of a particular policy pub/sub bus. In this
   example, the vPoPs would communicate that customer Z is
   assigned/configured a vCPE VNF of type Silver.

   Note that the described policy framework does not mandate or preclude
   use of detailed name spaces. However, to promote scalability and
   limit complexity, one should preferably use a name space hierarchy
   where the name spaces used by higher tier policy engines would be
   limited to higher level details. For example, suppose that vPoP A
   supports VNF types Silver.vCPE_X1 and Silver.vCPE_X2, that is,
   vCPE_X1 and vCPE_X2 are VNFs that were configured at vPoP A as
   supporting Silver services. Local policies in vPoP A would be used
   for the selection of vCPE_X1 or vCPE_X2 VNF when a service request
   requires a Silver vCPE VNF. vPoP A would report customer Z as using
   Silver.vCPE_X1 vCPE VNF (instead of simply Silver vCPE VNF) only when
   the name space between vPoP A and the global NFVO defines this
   granularity of Ethernet services. Note that one would want to define
   Silver.vCPE_X1 and Silver.vCPE_X2 as part of the policy name space
   between vPoP A and the global NFVO if the capability to specify such
   policy specificity is desired at the global level. However, the
   higher the degree of specificity allowed at the higher tiers of the
   policy hierarchy the higher the operational complexity.

Internet-Draft     Policy Arch and Framework for NFV      August 5, 2015


7.2 Policy-Based NFV Placement

   IRTF draft [10] describes a detailed example of a global policy
   written in Datalog [1] applicable to compute to promote energy
   conservation for the NFVIaaS use case [4] in an OpenStack framework.
   The goal of that policy is to address the energy efficiency
   requirements described in the ETSI NFV Virtualization Requirements
   [5].

   Related to the above, energy efficiency using analytics-driven
   policies in the context of OpenStack Congress [18] policy as a
   service was presented and demonstrated at the Vancouver OpenStack
   summit [11], where the Congress policy engine delegates VM placement
   to a VM placement engine that migrates under-utilized VMs to save
   energy.


8. Summary

   This document approached the policy framework and architecture from
   the perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services
   involving multiple subsystems. The analysis extended beyond common
   orchestration for compute, network, and storage subsystems to also
   include energy conservation constraints. This document also analyzed
   policy scope, global versus local policies, policy actions and
   translations, policy conflict detection and resolution, interactions
   among policies engines, and a hierarchical policy
   architecture/framework to address the demanding and growing
   requirements of NFV environments, applicable as well to general cloud
   infrastructures.

   The concept of NFV and the proposed policy architecture is applicable
   to service providers and also enterprises. For example, an enterprise
   branch office could have capacity and energy constraints similar to
   that of many service provider NFV vPoPs in constrained environments.
   This is an aspect that would be worth examining in detail in future
   work.

9. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not have any IANA considerations.

10. Security Considerations

   Security issues due to exchanging policies across different
   administrative domains are an aspect for further study.
