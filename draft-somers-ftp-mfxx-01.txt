Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the FTP specification STD9,
   RFC959, "FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)".  These extensions provide the
   ability for a FTP Client to modify the last modification time, the
   creation time, or multiple facts (last modification time, creation
   time, operating system permissions, etc.) of a file in the server-FTP
   process NVFS. These extensions are implemented by three new optional
   commands: "MFMT" (Modify File Modification Time), "MFCT" (Modify File
   Creation Time), and "MFF" (Modify File Facts).

Comments

   Comments should be directed to David Somers (dsomers@trevezel.com).

Internet-Draft    The 'MFxx' Command Extensions for FTP    February 2004


1. Introduction

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) currently defined in STD 9, RFC 959
   [1], and in place on the Internet allows files to be transferred
   between a server-FTP and a user-FTP, and vice versa.  When a file is
   transferred from the user-FTP to the server-FTP, the creation time,
   last modification time, and operating system facts (for example, file
   permissions) can not be specified.  The NVFS typically sets these to
   default values.

   This document defines extensions to the File Transfer Protocol,
   specifically three new optional commands "MFMT", "MFCT", and "MFF"
   which allow the last modification time, creation time, or a list of
   facts to be modified for an object in the NVFS.

   The MFF command is complimentary to the MLSx commands as detailed in
   [5].  The MLSx commands are used to standardize retrieving the file
   and directory information returned by the Server-FTP process; the MFF
   command aims to standardize modifying the facts for the file and
   directory objects in the NVFS.

2. Document Conventions

   This document makes use of the conventions in [2].  That provides the
   interpretation of capitalized imperative words like MUST, SHOULD,
   etc.

   This document also uses notation defined in [1].  In particular, the
   terms "reply", "user", "NVFS", "file", "pathname", "FTP commands",
   "DTP", "user-FTP process", "user-PI", "user-DTP", "server-FTP
   process", "server-PI", "server-DTP", "mode", "type", "NVT", "control
   connection", "data connection", and "ASCII", are all used here as
   defined there.

   Syntax required is defined using the Augmented BNF defined in [3].
   Some general ABNF definitions are required throughout the document,
   those will be defined later in this section.  At first reading, it
   may be wise to simply recall that these definitions exist here, and
   skip to the next section.

2.1 Basic Tokens

   This document defines basic tokens as specified in section 2.1 of
   [5].

2.2 Pathnames

   This document defines pathnames as specified in section 2.2 of [5].

2.3 Times

   This document defines times as specified in section 2.3 of [5].

2.4 Server Replies

   This document defines server replies as specified in section 2.4 of
   [5].

2.5 Interpreting Examples

   This document defines server replies as specified in section 2.5 of
   [5].

3. Modify File Modification Time (MFMT)

   The FTP command, MODIFY FILE MODIFICATION TIME (MFMT), is used to
   modify the last modification time of a file.

   It should be noted that similar functionality has been implemented by
   some server-PIs as the command MDTM.  However, the use of MDTM to
   modify the last modification time of a file conflicts with the use of
   the MDTM command to retrieve the last modification time of a file as
   defined in [5].  It is proposed that the MFMT command be used instead
   of abusing MDTM for such purposes.

3.1 Syntax

   The syntax of the MFMT command is:
   mfmt = "MFMT" SP time-val SP pathname CRLF

   As with all FTP commands, the "MFMT" command label is interpreted in
   a case insensitive manner.

   The "time-val" specifies the last modification time to be applied to
   the file.

   The "pathname" specifies an object in the NVFS.

   The server-PI will respond to the MFMT command with a 213 reply, or
   an error response if the object does not exist, the last modification
   time could not be modified, or some other error has occurred.

   mfmt-response = "213" SP "Modify=" time-val ";" SP pathname CRLF /
                    error-response

   The "time-val" in the response MUST be the modified last modification
   time of the file. This value MAY not be the same as that requested
   due to constraints of the NVFS to store the last modification time
   (for example, it may only have sufficient resolution to store the
   last modification time to the nearest minute instead of to the
   thousandths of a second that "time-val" MAY be specified to).

3.2 Error responses

   Where the command is correctly parsed, but the pathname identifies no
   existing entity, then a 550 reply SHOULD be sent.  Where the command
   can not be correctly parsed, a 500 or 501 reply SHOULD be sent.
   Various 4xy replies are also possible in appropriate circumstances.

3.3 FEAT response for MFMT

   Where a server-FTP process supports MFMT, as specified here, it MUST
   include the response to the FEAT command [4]:

   mfmt-feat = SP "MFMT" CRLF

   The initial space shown in the mfmt-feat response is that required by
   the FEAT command.

   This string "MFMT" is not case sensitive, but SHOULD be transmitted
   in upper case.  Where MFMT is not supported, the MFMT line MUST NOT
   be included in the FEAT response.

3.3.1 Example FEAT response

   C> feat
   S> 211- <any descriptive text>
   S>  ...
   S>  MFMT
   S>  ...
   S> 211 end

   The ellipses indicate place holders where other features may be
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the
   feature lines is mandatory [4].

3.4 MFMT Examples

   To modify the last modification time of a file called "Fred.txt" to
   July 17, 2002 21:07:15,

   C> MFMT 20020717210715 Fred.txt
   S> 213 Modify=20020717210715; Fred.txt

4. Modify File Creation Time (MFCT)

   The FTP command, MODIFY FILE CREATION TIME (MFCT), is used to modify
   the last modification time of a file.

   Implementers of this command on UNIX(TM) systems should note that the
   unix "stat" "st_ctime" field does not give creation time, and that
   unix file systems do not record creation time at all.  Unix (and
   POSIX) implementations will normally not support this command.

4.1 Syntax

   The syntax of the MFCT command is:
   mfct = "MFCT" SP time-val SP pathname CRLF

   As with all FTP commands, the "MFCT" command label is interpreted in
   a case insensitive manner.

   The "time-val" specifies the creation time to be applied to the file.

   The "pathname" specifies an object in the NVFS.

   The server-PI will respond to the MFCT command with a 213 reply, or
   an error response if the object does not exist, the creation time
   could not be modified, or some other error has occurred.

   mfct-response = "213" SP "Create=" time-val ";" SP pathname CRLF /
                    error-response

   The "time-val" in the response MUST be the modified creation time of
   the file. This value MAY not be the same as that requested due to
   constraints of the NVFS to store the creation time (for example, it
   may only have sufficient resolution to store the creation time to the
   nearest minute instead of to the thousandths of a second that
   "time-val" MAY be specified to).

4.2 Error responses

   Where the command is correctly parsed, but the pathname identifies no
   existing entity, then a 550 reply SHOULD be sent.  Where the command
   can not be correctly parsed, a 500 or 501 reply SHOULD be sent.
   Various 4xy replies are also possible in appropriate circumstances.

4.3 FEAT response for MFCT

   Where a server-FTP process supports MFCT, as specified here, it MUST
   include the response to the FEAT command [4]:

Internet-Draft    The 'MFxx' Command Extensions for FTP    February 2004


   mfct-feat = SP "MFCT" CRLF

   The initial space shown in the mfct-feat response is that required by
   the FEAT command.

   This string "MFCT" is not case sensitive, but SHOULD be transmitted
   in upper case.  Where MFCT is not supported, the MFCT line MUST NOT
   be included in the FEAT response.

4.3.1 Example FEAT response

   C> feat
   S> 211- <any descriptive text>
   S>  ...
   S>  MFCT
   S>  ...
   S> 211 end

   The ellipses indicate place holders where other features may be
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the
   feature lines is mandatory [4].

4.4 MFCT Examples

   To modify the creation time of a file called "Jim.txt" in the current
   directory to July 17, 2002 21:22:30,

   C> MFCT 20020717212230 Jim.txt
   S> 213 Create=20020717212230; Jim.txt

5. Modify File Facts (MFF)

   The FTP command, MODIFY FILE FACTS (MFF), is used to modify one or
   more facts of a file.  These facts are attributes such as creation
   time, last modification time, or operating system specific attributes
   such as file permissions.

   This command is complimentary to the MLSx commands as detailed in
   [5].  The MLSx commands are used to standardize retrieving the file
   and directory information returned by the Server-FTP process; the MFF
   command aims to standardize modifying the facts for the file and
   directory objects in the NVFS.

   When only modifying the creation time or the modification time of a
   file, it is RECOMMENDED that the MFCT or MFMT commands be used
   instead.

5.1 Syntax

   The syntax of the MFF command is:

   mff                = "MFF" [ mff-facts ] SP pathname CRLF
   mff-facts          = 1*( mff-fact ";" )
   mff-fact           = mff-standardfact / mff-osfact / mff-localfact
   mff-standardfact   = mff-createtimefact / mff-modifytimefact
   mff-createtimefact = "Create" "=" time-val
   mff-modifytimefact = "Modify" "=" time-val
   mff-osfact         = <IANA assigned OS name> "." token "=" *SCHAR
   mff-localfact      = "X." token "=" *SCHAR

   As with all FTP commands, the "MFF" command label is interpreted in a
   case insensitive manner.

   The "mff-facts" are a series of facts as keyword=value pairs each
   followed by a semi-colon (";") character.  Fact keyword names are
   case-insensitive.

   The "pathname" specifies an object in the NVFS.

   The server-PI will respond to the MFF command with a 213 reply
   containing a list of the facts that MUST detail the new values for
   all the facts specified in the request, or an error response.

   mff-response = "213" SP 1*( mff-fact ";") SP pathname CRLF /
                  error-response

   The order of the "mff-fact" keyword=value pairs returned in the
   response MAY be in any order.

Internet-Draft    The 'MFxx' Command Extensions for FTP    February 2004


   The "time-val" in the response MAY not be the same as that requested
   due to constraints of the NVFS to store such times (for example, it
   may only have sufficient resolution to store the last modification
   time to the nearest minute instead of to the thousandths of a second
   that "time-val" MAY be specified to).

   The error response MUST be returned if any of the following
   conditions happen:

      The object does not exist.

      A fact could not be modified, for example due to insufficient
      access control permissions.

      An unknown fact was specified.

   When an error response is returned, the client-PI MUST make no
   assumptions about which, if any, facts have been modified. The
   client-PI can issue an MLST (if the server-PI supports MLST) to
   determine what attributes have been modified.

5.1.1 Create fact

   The Create fact is used to modify the creation time of the object
   specified by "pathname".

   Implementers of this fact on UNIX(TM) systems should note that the
   unix "stat" "st_ctime" field does not give creation time, and that
   unix file systems do not record creation time at all.  Unix (and
   POSIX) implementations will normally not support this fact.

5.1.2 Modify fact

   The Modify fact is used to modify the last modification time of the
   object specified by "pathname".

5.2 Operating System specific facts

   Facts that are specific to an operating system, or file system,
   SHOULD be specified by keywords that are prefixed by an IANA
   operating system name ([6]).

   Implementation Note: It is envisioned that the operating system
   specific facts will be identical to those used by the MLSx command as
   detailed in [5]; implementers can then use the same logic to process
   facts whether for MLSx or MFF.

   The specification of Operating Systems specific facts is explicitly



Somers                   Expires August 6, 2004                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    The 'MFxx' Command Extensions for FTP    February 2004


   outside the scope of this document. Such specifications SHOULD be
   documented elsewhere (that is, in an internet draft, RFC, etc.)

5.2.1 Example Operating System specific facts

   The following examples are only indicative of how it is anticipated
   that some Operating System specific facts could be implemented.

   UNIX.mode             -- Unix file mode (expressed in octal)
   WINDOWS-NT.SIS.Author -- Windows NT,
                            Summary Information Stream, Author property


5.3 Local/Experimental "X." facts

   Implementations may define keywords for experimental, or private,
   use.  All such keywords MUST begin with the two character sequence
   "X.".  As type names are case-insensitive, "X." and "x." are
   equivalent.

5.4 Error responses

   Where the command is correctly parsed, but the pathname identifies no
   existing entity, then a 550 reply SHOULD be sent.  Where the command
   can not be correctly parsed, a 500 or 501 reply SHOULD be sent.  If
   an unknown fact is provided, a 504 reply SHOULD be sent.  Various 4xy
   replies are also possible in appropriate circumstances.

5.5 FEAT response for MFF

   Where a server-FTP process supports MFF, as specified here, it MUST
   include in the response to the FEAT command [4], a feature line
   containing the string "MFF".  This string is not case sensitive, but
   SHOULD be transmitted in upper case.  As well as indicating MFF
   support, the MFF feature line indicates which MFF facts are available
   for modification by the server-FTP process.  Where MFF is not
   supported, the MFF line MUST NOT be included in the FEAT response.

   mff-feat = SP "MFF" SP factlist CRLF
   factlist = 1*( factname ";" )

   The initial space shown in the mff-feat response is that required by
   the FEAT command.

5.5.1 Example FEAT responses

   C> feat
   S> 211- <any descriptive text>
   S>  ...
   S>  MFF Modify;
   S>  ...
   S> 211 end

   This server-FTP process indicates that it supports MFF, and only
   supports modification of the last modification time of an object in
   the NVFS.

   C> feat
   S> 211- <any descriptive text>
   S>  ...
   S>  MFF Create;Modify;WINDOWS-NT.SIS.Author;
   S>  ...
   S> 211 end

   This server-FTP process indicates that it supports MFF, and supports
   modification of the creation time, last modification time, and an
   operating system specific fact called "WINDOWS-NT.SIS.Author" of an
   object in the NVFS.

   The ellipses indicate place holders where other features may be
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the
   feature lines is mandatory [4].

5.6 MFF Examples

   To modify the creation time of a file called "Sheila.txt" to July 17,
   2002 21:22:30,

   C> MFF Create=20020717212230; Sheila.txt
   S> 213 Create=20020717212230; Sheila.txt

   Note that the above could also be achieved using the MFCT command,
   thus:

   C> MFCT 20020717212230 Sheila.txt
   S> 213 Create=20020717212230; Sheila.txt

   To modify the permissions on a Unix-based NVFS for the file called
   "Bob.txt" to (octal) 777,

   C> MFF UNIX.mode=777; Bob.txt
   S> 213 UNIX.mode=777; Bob.txt

Internet-Draft    The 'MFxx' Command Extensions for FTP    February 2004


   To modify the permissions on a Unix-based NVFS for the file called
   "Fred.txt" to (octal) 777, and the creation time to July 18, 2002
   01:28:45,

   C> MFF UNIX.mode=777;Create=20020718012845; Fred.txt
   S> 213 Create=20020718012845;UNIX.mode=777; Fred.txt

   If the same request was made to a server-FTP process that does not
   support the UNIX.mode fact,

   C> MFF UNIX.mode=777;Create=20020718012845; Fred.txt
   S> 504 Parameter Not Implemented (UNIX.mode)

   The creation date may or may not have been modified by the server-PI
   before the server-PI determined that the UNIX.mode fact was not

6. IANA Considerations

   This specification makes use of some lists of values currently
   maintained by the IANA.  It does not add any values to any existing
   registries.

6.1 The OS Specific fact registry

   The MFF command reuses the OS Specific fact registry that is used by
   the MLSx commands as detailed in [5]

   The OS names for the OS portion of the fact name must be taken from
   the IANA's list of registered OS names.  To add a fact name to this
   OS specific registry of OS specific facts, an applicant must send to
   the IANA a request, in which is specified the OS name, the OS
   specific fact name, a definition of the syntax of the fact value,
   which must conform to the syntax of a token as given in this
   document, and a specification of the semantics to be associated with
   the particular fact and its values.  Upon receipt of such an
   application, and if the combination of OS name and OS specific fact
   name has not been previously defined, the IANA will add the
   specification to the registry.

   Any examples of OS specific facts found in this document are to be
   treated as examples of possible OS specific facts, and do not form a
   part of the IANA's registry merely because of being included in this
   document.

7. Security Considerations

   No significant security issues, not already present in the FTP
   protocol, are believed to have been created by this extension.
