1. Introduction 

   The rapid growth of the today's communication system and its 
   access into almost all aspects of daily life has led to great 
   dependency on services it provides. The communication network, as 
   it is today, has applications such as multimedia and peer-to-peer 
   file sharing distribution that require Quality of Service (QoS) 
   guarantees in terms of delay and jitter to maintain a certain 
   level of performance. Meanwhile, mobile wireless communications 
   has become an important part to support modern sociality with 
   increasing importance over the last years. A communication network

   of hard real-time and high reliability is essential for the next 
   concurrent and next generation mobile wireless networks as well as 
   its bearer network for E-2-E performance requirements. 

   Conventional transport network is IP-based because of the 
   bandwidth and cost requirements. However the delay and jitter 
   guarantee becomes a challenge in case of contention since the 
   service here is not deterministic but best effort. With more and 
   more rigid demand in latency control in the future network [METIS], 
   deterministic networking [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture] is a 
   promising solution to meet the ultra low delay applications and 
   use cases. There are already typical issues for delay sensitive 
   networking requirements in midhaul and backhaul network to support 
   LTE and future 5G network [5G]. And not only in the telecom 
   industry but also other vertical industry has increasing demand on 
   delay sensitive communications as the automation becomes critical 
   recently.  

   More specifically, CoMP techniques, D-2-D, industrial automation 
   and gaming/media service all have great dependency on the low 
   delay communications as well as high reliability to guarantee the 
   service performance. Note that the deterministic networking is not 
   equal to low latency as it is more focused on the worst case delay 
   bound of the duration of certain application or service. It can be 
   argued that without high certainty and absolute delay guarantee, 
   low delay provisioning is just relative [RFC3393], which is not 
   sufficient to some delay critical service since delay violation in 
   an instance cannot be tolerated. Overall, the requirements from 
   vertical industries seem to be well aligned with the expected low 
   latency and high determinist performance of future networks 

   This document describes several use cases and scenarios with 
   requirements on deterministic delay guarantee within the scope of 
   the deterministic network [I-D.finn-detnet-problem-statement].

3. Critical Delay Requirements  

   Delay and jitter requirement has been take into account as a major 
   component in QoS provisioning since the birth of Internet. The 
   delay sensitive networking with increasing importance become the 
   root of mobile wireless communications as well as the applicable 
   areas which are all greatly relied on low delay communications. 
   Due to the best effort feature of the IP networking, mitigate 
   contention and buffering is the main solution to serve the delay 
   sensitive service. More bandwidth is assigned to keep the link low 
   loaded or in another word, reduce the probability of congestion. 
   However, not only lack of determinist but also has limitation to 
   serve the applications in the future communication system, keeping 
   low loaded cannot provide deterministic delay guarantee.  

   Take the [METIS] that documents the fundamental challenges as well 
   as overall technical goal of the 5G mobile and wireless system as 
   the starting point. It should supports: 

     -1000 times higher mobile data volume per area, 

     -10 times to 100 times higher typical user data rate, 

     -10 times to 100 times higher number of connected devices, 

     -10 times longer battery life for low power devices, and 

     -5 times reduced End-to-End (E2E) latency, 

   at similar cost and energy consumption levels as today's system. 
   Taking part of these requirements related to latency, current LTE 
   networking system has E2E latency less than 20ms [LTE-Latency] 
   which leads to around 5ms E2E latency for 5G networks. It has been 
   argued that fulfill such rigid latency demand with similar cost 
   will be most challenging as the system also requires 100 times 
   bandwidth as well as 100 times of connected devices. As a result 
   to that, simply adding redundant bandwidth provisioning can be no 
   longer an efficient solution due to the high bandwidth 
   requirements more than ever before. In addition to the bandwidth 
   provisioning, the critical flow within its reserved resource 
   should not be affected by other flows no matter the pressure of 
   the network. Robust defense of critical flow is also not depended 
   on redundant bandwidth allocation.  

   Deterministic networking techniques in both layer-2 and layer-3 
   using IETF protocol solutions can be promising to serve these 
   scenarios.

4. Coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP) 

   In the wireless communication system, Coordinated multipoint 
   processing (CoMP) is considered as an effective technique to solve 
   the inter-cell interference problem to improve the cell-edge user 
   throughput [CoMP].

            Figure 1: Framework of CoMP Technology 
    

   As shown in figure 1, CoMP reception and transmission is a 
   framework that multiple geographically distributed antenna nodes 
   cooperate to improve the performance of the users served in the 
   common cooperation area. The design principal of CoMP is to extend 
   the current single-cell to multi-UEs transmission to a multi-cell-
   to-multi-UEs transmission by base station cooperation. In contrast 
 
 
Zha, et al.            Expires January 1, 2016                [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft             DetNet Use Case                   July 2015 
    

   to single-cell scenario, CoMP has critical issues such as: 
   Backhaul latency, CSI (Channel State Information) reporting and 
   accuracy and Network complexity. Clearly the first two 
   requirements are very much delay sensitive and will be discussed 
   in next section. 

4.2. Delay Sensitivity in CoMP  

   As the essential feature of CoMP, signaling is exchanged between 
   eNBs, the backhaul latency is the dominating limitation of the 
   CoMP performance. Generally, JT and JP may benefit from 
   coordinating the scheduling (distributed or centralized) of 
   different cells in case that the signaling exchanging between eNBs 
   is limited to 4-10ms. For C-RAN the backhaul latency requirement 
   is 250us while for D-RAN it is 4-15ms. And this delay requirement 
   is not only rigid but also absolute since any uncertainty in delay 
   will down the performance significantly. Note that, some 
   operator's transport network is not build to support Layer-3 
   transfer in aggregation layer. In such case, the signaling is 
   exchanged through EPC which means delay is supposed to be larger.  

   CoMP has high requirement on delay and reliability which is lack 
   by current mobile network systems and may impact the architecture 
   of the mobile network.  

    

5. Industrial Automation 

   Traditional "industrial automation" terminology usually refers to 
   automation of manufacturing, quality control and material 
   processing. "Industrial internet" and "industrial 4.0" [EA12] is 
   becoming a hot topic based on the Internet of Things. This high 
   flexible and dynamic engineering and manufacturing will result in 
   a lot of so-called smart approaches such as Smart Factory, Smart 
   Products, Smart Mobility, and Smart Home/Buildings. No doubt that 
   ultra high reliability and robustness is a must in data 
   transmission, especially in the closed loop automation control 
   application where delay requirement is below 1ms and packet loss 
   less than 10E-9. All these critical requirements on both latency 
   and loss cannot be fulfilled by current 4G communication networks. 
   Moreover, the collaboration of the industrial automation from 
   remote campus with cellular and fixed network has to be built on 
   an integrated, cloud-based platform. In this way, the 
   deterministic flows should be guaranteed regardless of the amount 
   of other flows in the network. The lack of this mechanism becomes 
   the main obstacle in deployment on of industrial automation.

6. Vehicle to Vehicle  

   V2V communication has gained more and more attention in the last 
   few years and will be increasingly growth in the future. Not only 
   equipped with direct communication system which is short ranged, 
   V2V communication also requires wireless cellular networks to 
   cover wide range and more sophisticated services. V2V application 
   in the area autonomous driving has very stringent requirements of 
   latency and reliability. It is critical that the timely arrival of 
   information for safety issues. In addition, due to the limitation 
   of processing of individual vehicle, passing information to the 
   cloud can provide more functions such as video processing, audio 
   recognition or navigation systems. All of those requirements lead 
   to a highly reliable connectivity to the cloud. On the other hand, 
   it is natural that the provisioning of low latency communication 
   is one of the main challenges to be overcome as a result of the 
   high mobility, the high penetration losses caused by the vehicle 
   itself. As result of that, the data transmission with latency 
   below 5ms and a high reliability of PER below 10E-6 are demanded. 
   It can benefit from the deployment of deterministic networking 
   with high reliability. 

    

7. Gaming, Media and Virtual Reality 

   Online gaming and cloud gaming is dominating the gaming market 
   since it allow multiple players to play together with more 
   challenging and competing. Connected via current internet, the 
   latency can be a big issue to degrade the end users' experience. 
   There different types of games and FPS (First Person Shooting) 
   gaming has been considered to be the most latency sensitive online 
   gaming due to the high requirements of timing precision and 
   computing of moving target. Virtual reality is also receiving more 
   interests than ever before as a novel gaming experience. The delay 
   here can be very critical to the interacting in the virtual world. 
   Disagreement between what is seeing and what is feeling can cause 
   motion sickness and affect what happens in the game. Supporting 
   fast, real-time and reliable communications in both PHY/MAC layer, 
   network layer and application layer is main bottleneck for such 
   use case.  

   The media content delivery has been and will become even more 
   important use of Internet. Not only high bandwidth demand but also 
   critical delay and jitter requirements have to be taken into 
 
 
Zha, et al.            Expires January 1, 2016                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft             DetNet Use Case                   July 2015 
    

   account to meet the user demand. To make the smoothness of the 
   video and audio, delay and jitter has to be guaranteed to avoid 
   possible interruption which is the killer of all online media on 
   demand service. Now with 4K and 8K video in the near future, the 
   delay guarantee become one of the most challenging issue than ever 
   before. 4K/8K UHD video service requires 6Gbps-100Gbps for 
   uncompressed video and compressed video starting from 60Mbps. The 
   delay requirement is 100ms while some specific interactive 
   applications may require 10ms delay [UHD-video].
