                   The GLI system architecture


Abstract


In this document, overview of the Geographical Location Information
(GLI) system is described. It manages the latest geographical location
information and identifier of mobile nodes on the Internet. 
Each node registers its geographical location information
to this system, and users can look-up identifiers of nodes by
specifying location as a key, and vice versa. This system was designed
with consideration of privacy protection of mobile nodes and
scalability.


1   Introduction


We proposed the GLI system. The Geographical Location Information (GLI) 
is the system on the Internet, manages the latest geographical 
location information of mobile nodes.


The GLI system is based on the idea that the worldwide location system 
which can manage numerous number of mobile node existing on all over the 
world and protect the privacy of each mobile node.


In order to enable system scalability to manage numerous number of 
mobile node's location information, the GLI system takes distributed 
management manner and manages all over the world. 


The GLI system also realize to protect the privacy of mobile node
systematically by using unique identifier called HID as a mobile
node's ID. The identifier can't be generated by the third person for
the mobile node with the identifier.


The GLI system provides two types of lookup function. The first is
called Forward-Lookup function that is the search which uses the
identifier of the node as the key, and gives the geographical location
information of the specified mobile node. And the second is called
Reverse-Lookup function that is the search which uses the area as the
key, and gives the geographical location information of the mobile
nodes within the specified area as a result of lookup.

2   Overview


2.1  Requirements


It is necessary for the GLI system to enable to manage many mobile nodes
over the world. There are four requirements for designing this system.


a. Service model for the location information and its definition


There are many mobile nodes connected to the Internet with geographical
location information. In such case, it is expected that enable us to do
the following examples of search.


ex.
- To acquire the geographical location information of the specified
  mobile node


- To search mobile nodes that exist in the specified geographical
  location information


- To search the nearest service or resource from the specified
  geographical location information


- Multicast communication based on geographical location information


In each example, it is necessary to use both identifiers and
geographical location information of mobile nodes as a key of search.
Service model of the geographical location information should be
defined considering above two types of search.


b. To register identifier and location of mobile nodes correctly and
   reliably


To make geographical location information service practically usable,
it is necessary that such registered information of mobile nodes can be
correct and reliable. The followings are requirements for managing
information of mobile nodes.


- one mobile node can register its information to the service itself.
- registered information must not exposure to the unreliable third person.
- information of mobile nodes should be updated to the latest one.


c. Secure exchanging the location information


Identifier and geographical location information of mobile nodes are
private information.  So it is necessary to take care of treating such
information through the internet and accessing it. For example,


- information of one mobile node may be known to its reliable person
- information of one mobile node must not be known and be tracked by
  unknown person.


d. Many mobile nodes can also register and be managed


Many mobile nodes exists ubiquitously over the world. Especially most
of mobile nodes are vehicles. There are many types of vehicle, for
example car, truck, bus, train, airplane and etc. The number of car is
at least 1 billion. So, system should be designed to manage such mobile
nodes in an earth scale.

2.2  GLI system concept


2.2.1 GLI system functionality


The GLI system has a function to manage identifier and coordinates as
geographical location information of mobile nodes on the Internet,
also has API to look-up nodes and interfaces for positioning device
such as GPS (Figure 1).


Every mobile nodes has various types of positioning device. If it trys
to register its location to the GLI system, it needs to exchange the
location information to coordinates. Likewise, as most of applications
use name of place, if they use the GLI system, they need to exchange
the location information to coordinates.

2.2.2 Mobile node and managed information on the GLI system


A mobile node moves in physical space, and the geographical location
information changes dynamically.


The GLI system manages identifier and geographical location
information of such mobile nodes. Geographical location information
consists of latitude, longitude, and an altitude. Identifier is used
for identifying mobile node. It is globally unique. As the
representative form of identifier, Hashed ID(HID) and FQDN are
used. HID is considered possibility of being specified. FQDN can be
used for public use.


Detail about HID is described later section.


2.2.3 Model for managing geographical location information of mobile
      nodes


The GLI system consists of the model for managing geographical location
information of mobile nodes. The model consists mobile nodes, servers,
look-up clients. Each mobile node registers its identifier and
geographical location information to servers. Look-up clients send
lookup requests to servers, and receive answer from servers as shown
the following figure.

2.2.4 Look-up


The GLI system supports two types of looking-up. One is Forward look-up.
It is a way of looking-up geographical location information using key
as identifier of a mobile node.


Another is Reverse lookup. It is a way of looking-up identifiers using
key as geographical location information. The reverse look-up has two
types of look-up as shown the following figure. 


One is Range search that looks up mobile nodes in squared area
consisting of two points.  They are A and B shown in Figure 3. The GLI
system that received a request of Range search replys the list
consists of identifier and location information of 4 points shown in
Figure 3.


Another is Nearest search that looks up nearest mobile nodes from a
specified point. It is A shown in Figure 4. The GLI system that
received a request of Nearest search replys the list consists of
identifier and location information of 3 points shown in Figure 4.

2.3  Security Consideration


2.3.1 Threat around mobile nodes and GLI system


GLI system is supposed to work on the Internet. There are some
threats around mobile nodes and GLI system. In this section, threats
around GLI system and assumption are described.


[Assumption]


 Servers in the GLI system have a confidential relation. One look-up
 client can look-up mobile nodes with confidential relation with
 itself, another look-up client can not look-up mobile nodes without
 confidential relation with itself.


[Threats]


 In a servers, data may be stolen and rewritten by the third
 person. In the Internet, data may be falsificated by wiretapping by
 the third person. Some Mobile nodes may be spoofed, tracked by the
 third person.


2.3.2 Requirements and solution for security


Authentication of each mobile node can prevent of spoofing.
Encrypting communication path can prevent of wiretapping and
falsification of data. That location of mobile nodes may be specified
by the third person is out of scope. For the threat of specifying a
mobile node by unknown person and tracking a mobile node by unknown
person, it is necessary to conceal identifiers of mobile nodes from
unknown third person.


2.3.3 Privacy protection and Identifier of mobile nodes


Requirements to protect privacy are to allow to specify mobile nodes
from persons with a confidential relation and to prevent of specifying
by the unknown third person without a confidential relation, and to
prevent of tracking.


Geographical location information tells real location on the
earth. However, this system does not hide the geographical location of
each mobile node.


To look-up mobile nodes using a key as specified identifier, two types
of identifier are introduced. One is FQDN, every look-up client can
use and specify mobile nodes. Another is Hashed ID(HID), only look-up
client with a confidential relation to it needs to understand the
identifier, the third person can not understand.


2.3.4 HID (Hashed ID)


For such requirements, HID (Hashed ID) is designed for the GLI system.
To use HID, both a mobile nodes and look-up clients in a confidential
relation have secret identifier for mobile nodes and time information
to generate HID. The time information is changed with time. So, to
input two valuables to a hash function can generates HID. HID is also
changed with time, and can prevent tracking. The formula which
generates HID is shown below.






Yasuhito Watanabe   Toshiharu Kurisu    Sohgo Takeuchi, et al.  [Page 5]
The GLI system architecture     Jul  2004


      HID = hash ( ID, ts + ttl * n)
      ID: secret identifier
      ts: base time stamp
      ttl: the interval of base time stamp to be changed
      n:  n is zero or more integers.


In current implementation of the GLI system, HMAC-SHA1 is used for
generating HID, HID has 160 bit length.


Example.
ID: icar1@sfc ts: 969160000 ttl: 300 random1: 345 random2:678 random3: 789

3   Architecture


The GLI system consists of Registration Client, Registration Server,
HOME Server, HID Server, AREA Server, Lookup Client, and Lookup Server.
In order to provide a highly scalable system, the HID Server and the
AREA Server are distributed based on a hierarchical server structure.


3.1  Registration Client


Registration Client sends Registration Message to the Registration
Server with confidential relation. Registration Message contains the ID
of the client and location information .
 The ID may be expressed in two ways: by using
FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name) or by using HID(Hashed ID).
 If the Registration Client prefers to
disclose the real identifier(the information that can specify the individual, 
such as name, telephone number, etc), the client may use the HID as 
the ID in the GLI system. The client changes the HID at fixed intervals 
to prevent the possibility of any trace by the third person.


3.2  Regsitration Server


Registration Server receives Registration Message from the clients and
forwards the received message to a HOME(HID) Server or to a Area


Server.  If the Registration Client uses the FQDN as its identifier,
Registration Server forwards the message to a HOME Server. Likewise,
if the client uses the HID as its identifier, Registration Server
forwards the message to a HID Server.


In the GLI system, multiple Registration Servers may exist.  Each
Registration Server transacts the message from Registration Clients
with conficential relation . In order to decline


a burden of HID(HOME) Server and AREA Server, Registration Server
caches delegation information of distributed HID(HOME) Servers and
AREA Servers.


Following figure shows the Registration Message flow between the
Registration Client, the Registra-tion Server, the HID(HOME) Server and
the AREA Server.

                    Figure 6: Regitration Message Flow


3.3  HOME Server


HOME Server maintains the FQDN of each registered client along with
the latest geographical location information, and processes
Forward-Lookup requests. The hierarchy of the HOME Servers is
constructed as in DNS, where servers manage domains represented in
the name specified in the FQDN. For example, the client with ID of
chris.wide.ad.jp is registered at the HOME Server of wide.ad.jp.


3.4  HID Server


HID Server maintains the HID of each registered client along with
latest geographical location information, and processes Forward-Lookup
requests. The hierarchy of the HID Servers is a tree structure where
ROOT HID Server masks the first 4bits of the HID(160bit) and obtains
the MASK NUMBER(0-f).  The server delegates the MASK NUMBER to the
lower HID Servers, and the delegated HID Servers mask the next 4bits
of the HID and delegate like upper layer server. Then the HID Server can 
be up to 40 layers hierarchal structure.


Following figure7 shows an example of the delegation. ROOT HID Server
refers the first 4 bits of HID as MASK NUMBER. The ROOT HID Server
delegates MASK NUMBER(0-3) to Server A, MASK NUMBER(4-7) to Server B,
and manages MASK NUMBER(8-f) by itself. In 1st Layer, HID Server refers
the next 4bits of HID as MASK NUMBER. Server A delegates MASK NUMBER(0-5)
to Server C, and manages MASK NUMBER(6-f) by itself. In 2nd Layer,
Server C does not delegate.


In this environment, location information of mobile nodes are
maitained at the following servers;



(1) "a0df.........d2(160bits)", is maintained at ROOT HID Server.
(2) "40df.........a5(160bits)", is maintained at Server B.
(3) "17df.........1d(160bits)", is maintained at Server A.
(4) "24ac.........8f(160bits)", is maintained at Server C.

3.5  AREA Server


AREA Server maintains the latest geographical location information of
Registration Clients that are within the service area, and processes
Reverse-Lookup requests. The hierarchy of the AREA Servers is
constucted from four layers which are ROOT layer, DEGREE layer, MINUTE
layer, and SECOND layer, expressed in Longitude and Latitude.



The ROOT layer has one AREA Server (ROOT AREA Server) which serves the
entire world. The ROOT AREA Server can delegate the rectangle area
specified by minimum and maximum degree value of longitude and latitude
to DEGREE layer server. The DEGREE layer MAY have several AREA Servers
managing different areas. The servers in the DEGREE layer can also
delegate the rectangle area specified by minimum and maximum minute
value of longitude and latitude to the MIMUTE layer server. Likewise,
the MINUTE layer, the servers can also delegate the rectangle area
specified by minimum and maximum second value of longitude and latitude
to the SECOND layer server. Figure8 below shows the overview of the AREA
Server's delegation. The ROOT Server manages the entire world, and
delegates area "A" to server A, and area "B" to server B. Server A and
Server B belongs to the DEGREE Layer. Server A delegates area "C" within
area "A" to Server C. Server B does not delegate. Server C belongs to
the MINUTE Layer and also delegates area "D" within area "C" to Server
D. Server D belongs to the SECOND Layer, but can not delegate any more.

3.6  Lookup Client


3.6.1 Forward-Lookup


Forward-Lookup is a search mechanism for location information of the
mobile node specified by the Forward-Lookup Client. Forward-Lookup
Client sends Forward-Lookup request message to Lookup Server. 
Forward-Lookup request message contains the identifier of a mobile node
of which the client specifies. Lookup Server forwards the request
message to HID(HOME) server and receives the result. Forward-Lookup Client
receives the lookup result from the Lookup Server. Following figure 10
shows the Forward-Lookup message flow between the Forward-Lookup Client,
Lookup Server, and HID(HOME) Server.


+----------------+ request  +------------+  request    +---------------+
| Forward-Lookup |--------->| Lookup     |------------>|  HID(HOME)    |
| Client         |<---------| Server     |<------------|  Server       |
+----------------+  reply   +------------+  reply      +---------------+



              Figure 10: The Forward-Lookup message flow




3.6.2 Reverse-Lookup


Reverse-Lookup is a search mechanism for entities within the area
specified by the Reverse-Lookup Client. Reverse-Lookup Clients send
Reverse-Lookup request message to a Lookup Server. In the case of 
range search, Reverse-Lookup request message contains the minimum and 
maximum value of longitude and latitude of the area. Lookup Server 
forwards the request message to AREA server and receives the result. 
The client receives the list of the identifier and location information 
of the mobile nodes that are in the specified area. Following figure 11 
shows the Reverse-Lookup message flow between the Reverse-Lookup Client, 
Lookup Server, and AREA Server.




+----------------+ request  +------------+  request    +---------------+
| Reverse-Lookup |--------->| Lookup     |------------>|  AREA         |
| Client         |<---------| Server     |<------------|  Server       |
+----------------+  reply   +------------+  reply      +---------------+

3.7  Lookup Server


3.7.1 Forward-Lookup


When Lookup Server receives Forward-Lookup request message from Lookup
Client, it forwards the received message to HOME(HID) Server. Same as
Registration Server, if the identifier contained in the received message
is FQDN, the message MUST BE sent to the HOME Server. Otherwise, the
message MUST BE sent to the HID Server. When Lookup Server receive the
lookup result message from the HID(HOME) Server, it forwards the message to
lookup client.

3.7.2 Reverse-Lookup


When Lookup Server receives Reverse-Lookup request message from Lookup
Client, it forwards the received message to AREA Server. When Lookup
Sever receives the lookup result message from the AREA Server(s) (If
the area specified in the request message covers two or more domains
which are covered by different AREA Servers, the result message are
received from  multiple AREA Servers.), it forwards the result message
to lookup client. 


In order to decline a burden of HID(HOME) Server and AREA Server,
Lookup Server caches delegation information of distributed
HID(HOME) Server and AREA Server.


4 TODO


We have already implemented the GLI system. Now we have been actual proof
experimenting using some real cars and virtual cars generated by ITS simulater.
Our recent TODO 
1. Evaluate the GLI system based on actual proof experiment.
2. Publish internet-draft about the GLI system specification.
3. Examine whether we apply RuleMaker and RuleHolder defined in RFC3693 
   to the GLI system in order to realize flexible privacy protect.
