1. Introduction 

   With the deployment of IP video multicast service, there is an 
   increasing demand for the performance monitoring for providers' 
   multicast network.  The benefits of performance monitoring are to 
   guarantee the service level agreement (SLA) provided to the customers, 
   to discover the network performance defects proactively, to react in 
   response to the failure quickly, and further to optimize the network 
   resources utilizations.  

   This document describes an IP multicast network performance 
   monitoring solution referred to as Inline Real Stream Monitoring 
   (IRSM) based on the requirements given in [2].  IRSM is proposed to 
   meet the service provider's manageability requirements on 
   increasingly deployed multicast network.  It enables efficient 
   measurement of performance metrics of a multicast channel and 
   provides diagnostic information in case of performance degradation or 
   failure.

2.1. Terminologies 

   IRSM: Inline Real Stream Monitoring 

   (S,G): a source address and group address pair to identify a 
   multicast forwarding channel or multicast forwarding state.

Internet-Draft   IRSM multicast performance monitoring        March 2010 
    

   (*,G): a notation for multicast forwarding state to receive from all 
   the sources sending to this group. 

   MEG: Maintenance Entity Group 

   MEP: MEG Maintenance Point 

   MEP_I: MEP Ingress 

   MEP_E: MEP Egress 

   MIP: MEG Intermediate Point 

   On-demand: OAM operation manner initiated manually and for a limited 
   amount of time, usually for fault diagnostics. 

   Proactively: preconfigured OAM operation manner either running 
   periodically and continuously, or acting on certain events such as 
   alarm signals. 

3. Characteristics of IRSM 

   IRSM currently utilizes packet Loss Measurement (LM) and packet Delay 
   Measurement (DM) to accomplish performance monitoring.  It has 
   following features desirable as a carrier-grade monitoring scheme, as 
   required in [2]: 

   o Independency - It is operated independently from multicast 
   forwarding plane and control plane and it does not have bad 
   influences on the running of the two planes. 

   o Real stream - The data to be monitored is from real multicast 
   stream, usually specified by (*,G) or (S,G) pairs.   

   o Inline - It enables the on-the-spot measurement or monitoring when 
   carrier network is loaded with customer multicast traffic. 

   o Inband - The OAM measurement packet is routed following strictly 
   the same multicast forwarding path as the monitored multicast stream, 
   which help gathering the true network forwarding metrics. 

   o End-to-End and per segment measurement - It is capable of 
   monitoring the whole end-to-end forwarding path from one multicast 
   root to one or more leaf nodes, which provides the path performance 
   for a particular multicast stream as a whole.  It also supports 
   measurement for a segment (i.e. a forwarding branch, a forwarding 
   node or the combination of them) of a multicast forwarding path.  The

   features enable the monitoring of a whole multicast tree, of one or 
   more forwarding paths, and of parts of the tree or path(s).  

   o Proactive and on-demand modes - It is capable of carrying out a 
   measurement session proactively or on demand according to the 
   configured management policy.  

4. IRSM Message 

   Two IRSM message types are defined: Loss Measurement (LM) message and 
   Delay Measurement (DM) message.  An example format of both LM and DM 
   messages are given in section 5.2 and 5.3 respectively. 

4.1. Encapsulation 

   IRSM measurement messages are encapsulated in IP packets. Same SA, DA 
   and DSCP value as the multicast stream monitored are used for IRSM 
   packets. By this means, it is ensured that IRSM packets for a 
   specific (S,G) or (*,G) follow the exact same data path as user 
   traffic, i.e. fate sharing. IRSM packets can be distinguished from 
   the data traffic using a dedicated IP protocol type in IP header. In 
   another way, an UDP port number could be assigned to make this 
   identification. Using UDP port requires an intermediate MIP node to 
   look deeper into an OAM packet, which introduces additional 
   processing burden on MIP nodes. 

   The data part of an IRSM message adopts the popular Type-Length-Value 
   structure, as shown in figure 2. 

   0                   1                   2                   3

5. Principle of IRSM  

5.1. Measurement Architecture 

   Three functional entities are defined in IRSM measurement 
   architecture: MEP-I (Maintenance Entity Point - Ingress), MIP 
   (Maintenance Intermediate Point) and MEP-E (Maintenance Entity Point 
   - Egress).  They are logical entities that can be configured on the 
   incoming or outgoing interfaces of the monitoring equipments.  The 
   relationship of these entities is illustrated in figure 1. 

    
   +------+     +------+     +------+     +-------+    +------+

      <>     Interface 
      ------  Link 
    
          Figure 1.  The relationship of MEP and MIP entities 

   The basic function of MEP-I is to initiate a measurement session.  It 
   generates OAM measurement packets for certain (S,G) or (*,G) and 
   injects it into the data traffic.  The measurement session could be 
   initiated either proactively or on-demand. During a packet loss 
   measurement, MEP-I takes count of the transmitted packets from a 
   specific multicast stream and sends out the Loss Measurement (LM) 
   message along the multicast path carrying this packet count.  For 
   delay measurement, MEP-I generates the Delay Measurement (DM) message 
   recording the locally generated timestamp. 

   MEP-E is the end point of the measurement path.  It terminates the 
   OAM measurement packets and measures the packet loss or delay from 
   MEP-I to MEP-E.  MEP-E calculates the packet loss from MEP-I 
   according to local packet count of the stream and the packet count in 
   the received LM packet sent by MEP-I, and calculates the delay from 
   MEP-I by comparing the timestamp carried in the DM message and local 
   time for receiving this message. 

   MIP entity locates between MEP-I and MEP-E and forward OAM packets 
   from upstream MEP-I to downstream MEP-E(s).  It is optionally 
   configured on the intermediate node of a multicast forwarding path.  
   If MIP function is enabled on an intermediate node, it can perform 
 
 
Liu,etc.               Expires September 2010                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft   IRSM multicast performance monitoring        March 2010 
    

   the measurement segment by segment.  An MIP entity snoops the OAM 
   measurement packets and calculates the packet loss and delay from 
   MEP-I to itself in the same way as an MEP-E does. 

   If MEP-I is configured on the root node and MEP-E configured on the 
   leaf node, then the monitored path is a complete multicast forward 
   path, as depicted in figure 1.  If MEP-I or MIP-E is configured on an 
   intermediate node, then part of the multicast path could be monitored. 

5.2. Packet Loss Measurement 

   Packet loss measurement could be performed proactively or on demand 
   according to the configuration of a measurement session.  In 
   proactive mode, LM packet will be transmitted by MEP-I continuously 
   with a specific time interval.  For on-demand mode, LM will be sent 
   based on a specified schedule, which could be periodically, or based 
   on a pre-arranged schedule.  If the schedule is for a single 
   measurement, then two LM messages are required to be generated, the 
   reason is given as below. 

   When a measurement session starts, MEP-I counts the transmitted 
   packets from a multicast data stream for a specified time interval.  
   If the timer or the counter expires, MEP-I generates an LM packet 
   carrying this transmitted packet count (say Tx_Count) of the 
   multicast data packets having been sent.  The LM packet is injected 
   into the data stream, and forwarded in the same way as a real 
   multicast data packet. 

   MEP_E counts the number of the received packet from a multicast 
   stream for a specified time (denoted as Rx_Count).  The packet loss 
   is the difference between the two counters (i.e. Rx_Count - Tx_Count).  
   This calculation is not correct when the packet counter(s) of MEP_I 
   and/or MEP_E wraps after reaching their maximum values.  Two 
   successive measurements are used to eliminate this effect, with the 
   calculation taken as: 

       (Tx_Count2 - Tx_Count)-(Rx_Count - Rx_Count) 

   Where Tx_Count and Tx_Count are respectively packet count values 
   carried in two successive packets, and Rx_Count and Rx_Count are 
   packet counts locally accumulated by MEP_E during the same time 
   interval. 

   If MIP function is enabled on an intermediate node, it will snoop the 
   measurement packets and count the received data packets locally.  On 
   receiving an LM packet, it records the current local packet count 
   (say Rx_Count1_MIP) and the transmitted packet count Tx_Count1 in the 
 
 
Liu,etc.               Expires September 2010                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft   IRSM multicast performance monitoring        March 2010 
    

   received LM packet.  And after receiving a subsequent LM packet, it 
   takes the same action as above to acquire the local packet count (say 
   Rx_Count2_MIP) and the transmitted packet count carried in this LM 
   packet (say Tx_Count2).  The packet loss is calculated as: 

    Packet Loss = (Tx_Count2 - Tx_Count1)-(Rx_Count2_MIP -Rx_Count1_MIP) 

    The calculation could be performed in a process component within 
   (e.g., a dedicated process component) or outside (e.g., NMS) the MIP 
   node. 

   Each MIP and MEP-E node on the path could obtain the packet loss 
   statistics of the path from MEP-I to itself by this means and both 
   per-segment and end-to-end performance monitoring are available 
   within a measurement session.  The integration of the overall 
   measurement results could help to detect and locate the failure 
   point(s) and the performance bottle point(s) along the forwarding 
   path, which is shown in section 6.1. 

5.3. Packet Delay Measurement 

   Time synchronization among the measuring entities is required for 
   packet delay measurement.  The measurement process of DM is almost 
   the same as packet loss measurement.  It can be operated proactively 
   or on-demand.  The only difference is that the process is based on a 
   timestamp value other than a packet counter.   

   When a measurement session starts, MEP-I generates DM packets 
   carrying the local timestamps (say Tx_Time) and sends them onto the 
   multicast path. The DM packets are forwarded in the same way as the 
   normal multicast data. 

   When MEP_E receives a DM packet, it records the local timestamp that 
   identifies the arrival time of the DM packet (Rx_Time).  The delay 
   measurement result could be calculated by: 

        Packet Delay = Rx_Time - Tx_Time     

   Similarly, if MIP function is enabled in an intermediate node, it 
   will snoop the DM packet to get the timestamps of the time when a DM 
   packets are sent at MEP-I.  On receipt of a DM packet, the MIP node 
   records the local timestamp (say Rx_Timestamp_MIP) and the timestamp 
   (say Tx_Timestamp) carried in the DM packet. The packet delay between 
   MEP-I and MIP could be calculated as (Rx_Time MIP- Tx_Time).  Similar 
   to LM measurement, the calculation could be performed in a process 
   component within (e.g., a dedicated process component) or outside 
   (e.g., NMS) the MIP node.

   Each MIP and MEP-E entity could acquire the packet delay information 
   from MEP-I to itself.  By this means it is able to perform per-
   segment and end-end delay measurement within a single measurement 
   session, which helps detection and isolation of performance defect 
   points, as shown in section 6.2 

6. Application in multicast network monitoring 

   This section describes how packet loss measurement and packet delay 
   measurement are used in IRSM to accomplish multicast network 
   performance monitoring.  To simplify the illustration, a small 
   multicast tree is depicted in figure 5.  In this example, downstream 
   interface of the root node acts as MEP-I, upstream and downstream 
   interfaces of intermediate nodes are configured as MIPs, and upstream 
   interfaces of leaf nodes are assigned as MEP-Es.

6.1. Fault Detection and Localization Based on LM 

   The sending and processing of LM packets by MEP and MIP enable the 
   fault detection and location for performance monitoring, both for 
   network link and network node.  Suppose in figure 5, the link C-E 
   between router1 and router2 has performance bottleneck which causes 
   packet losses.  Based on the principle given in section 4.2, all the 
   monitoring entities on the downstream of the link will perceive this 
   loss by packet loss calculation, while the upstream will not.  
   Because the downstream entities (i.e. MIP5, MIP6, MIP7, MEP-E2, MEP-

   E3) will detect the packet losses, whereas the upstream entities (i.e. 
   MIP1 and MIP2) will not, it can be inferred that the link between C 
   and E are suffering from performance problem. 

   The degradation of an intermediate node can also be detected and 
   isolated in this way.  For example if router2 has forwarding defect 
   which introduces packet loss, by snooping LM messages and counting 
   locally received packets, MIP6, MIP7, MEP-E2, and MEP-E3 will detect 
   the packet loss while the upstream MIP1, MIP2 and MIP5 will not.  The 
   fault point of router2 will be easily located.  

   It is even possible to detect multiple point failures along the 
   multicast forwarding path, if such errors occur.  In figure 5, if 
   link C-E and H-J both undergo packet losses, all the entities down 
   from the C-E will detect the defects.  But as MIP7 and MEP-E3 have 
   different packet loss values from MIP5, in which case packet loss 
   detected in MIP7 and MEP-E3 are equal but are greater than those 
   measured  in MIP5, then additional fault point of link H-J could be 
   easily picked out. 

6.2. Fault Detection and Localization Based on DM 

   The fault detection and location principle of the packet delay 
   measurement is the same as that of packet loss measurement given in 
   section 6.1.  If the link or node has defects that cause packet delay 
   increasing, their downstream MIPs and MEP-Es will perceive them.  If 
   the delay value rises over a reasonable threshold level, then it can 
   be judged that the link or node is undergoing performance abnormities.  
   The DM could be operated to support single-point link and node 
   detection, multipoint link and node detection, as long as the 
   forwarding path is equipped with enough monitoring entities. 

7. Deployment Considerations 

   When IRSM is deployed in practical network, many issues should be 
   considered to enable the scheme to work efficiently.  Here are 
   emulated some of the key aspects that should be paid special 
   attention to when implementing IRSM. 

7.1. Acquisition of monitored stream 

   Because LM needs to take count of the data packet from a real stream, 
   an IRSM-enabled node must provide the means to acquire the multicast 
   stream to be monitored.  In practice this could be implemented by an 
   ACL method.  If the stream to be monitored is specified by an (*,G) 
   or an (S,G) pair, the ACL policy could be set to permit the packets 
   belong to this stream to be processed by the IRSM module.

7.2. Alarm and Reporting Processing 

   The alarming and reporting method in case of abnormal and normal 
   status should be in the scope of network planning and should be 
   designed according to the local policy of the management and the 
   scale of the multicast tree.  To prevent alarm and report from 
   overburdening the network and the NMS systems, the amount of these 
   messages generated should be minimized. 

   In IRSM performance monitoring, a feasible scheme is to let only the 
   MEP-E entities alarm the exception state when packet loss or 
   unacceptable packet delay is detected.  MIP nodes only log the 
   exception and will only send report to the management system 
   regularly or passively in response to the queries.  It needs further 
   study on how to design in detail the alarming and reporting functions 
   of an IRSM system. 

7.3. Configuration of Monitoring Nodes 

   IRSM performance monitoring system should be flexible enough for the 
   provider to operate.  For example, the provider may at this time 
   prefer proactively monitoring and in other occasions need to take 
   some discrete tests on demand.  He may choose to monitor the whole 
   multicast tree, only some important forwarding paths or branches, or 
   even merely several nodes prone to performance degradation.  An IRSM-
   capable node should be able to be enabled or disabled for its 
   monitoring function as required by a configuration operation to 
   support this flexibility. 

   The configuration should also be used to provide the parameters of a 
   monitoring session, such as the OAM execution frequency, the starting 
   or ending of a monitoring session, the multicast stream to be 
   monitored, and etc.  The configuration could be implemented as the 
   manual manner by an administrator, or by a control plane protocol.  
   The latter has the advantages of flexibility and scalability.  It is 
   for further study on how to realize a practical configuration control. 

7.4. Topology Discovery  

   Topology discovery is the precondition of the monitoring of a 
   multicast tree.  IRSM administrator could make use of current 
   available multicast tree topology discovery tool in a multicast 
   management system.  If this is unavailable, it is possible to define 
   a lightweight tool specific for IRSM uses.

7.5. Interoperation among Different Vendors 

   If equipments from different vendors are deployed in the same 
   multicast tree or on the same multicast forwarding path, cares should 
   be taken to interoperate them well to fulfill the performance 
   monitoring task.  Because the LM and DM packets are treated normally 
   as the multicast data packets, the only interoperability requirement 
   is that those intermediate IRSM-incapable equipments do not discard 
   the LM or DM packets.  

8. Security Considerations 

   It should be recognized that conducting performance monitoring 
   measurements can raise security concerns. IRSM system, in which 
   traffic is injected into the network, can be abused for denial-of-
   service attacks disguised as legitimate measurement activity. 
   Authentication, authorization and encryption techniques may be used 
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks. These 
   aspects will be discussed in the future version of the memo. 

9. IANA Considerations 

   If IP Protocol in IP header is used as the Identification of IRSM OAM 
   packets, then a new IP protocol value is required to be assigned by 
   IANA. 

   If UDP port number in UDP header is used as the identification of 
   IRSM OAM packets, then a new UDP value is required to be assigned by 
   IANA.
