Applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
                       (ACTN) to Network Slicing
             draft-ietf-teas-applicability-actn-slicing-01

Abstract

   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network
   domain to obtain a view of potential connectivity across the network
   by utilizing a set of policies to select network resources.

   Network slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on
   the concept of network abstraction to provide programmability,
   flexibility, and modularity.  It may use techniques such as Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to
   create multiple logical or virtual networks, each tailored for a set
   of services that share the same set of requirements.

   Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) is
   described in RFC 8453.  It defines an SDN-based architecture that
   relies on the concept of network and service abstraction to detach
   network and service control from the underlying data plane.

   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to network slicing
   in a Traffic Engineering (TE) network that utilizes IETF technology.
   It also identifies the features of network slicing not currently
   within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where ACTN might be extended.

1.  Introduction

   The principles of network resource separation are not new.  For
   years, the concepts of separated overlay and logical (virtual)
   networking have existed, allowing multiple services to be deployed
   over a single physical network comprised of single or multiple
   layers.  However, several key differences exist that differentiate
   overlay and virtual networking from network slicing.

   A network slice is a virtual (that is, logical) network with its own
   network topology and a set of network resources that are used to
   provide connectivity that conforms to a specific Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) or set of Service Level Objectives (SLOs).  The
   network resources used to realize a network slice belong to the
   network that is sliced.  The resources may be assigned and dedicated
   to an individual slice, or they may be shared with other slices
   enabling different degrees of service guarantee and providing
   different levels of isolation between the traffic in each slice.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] provides a definitions for
   network slicing in the context of IETF network technologies.  In
   particular, that document defines the term "IETF Network Slice" to be
   the generic network slice concept applied to a network that uses IETF
   technologies.  An IETF Network Slice could span multiple technologies
   (such as IP, MPLS, or optical) and multiple administrative domains.
   The logical network that is an IETF Network Slice may be kept
   separate from other concurrent logical networks each with independent
   control and management: each can be created or modified on demand.
   Since this document is focused entirely on IETF technologies, it uses
   the term "network slice" as a more concise expression.  Further
   discussion on the topic of IETF Network Slices and details of how an
   IETF Network Slice service may be requested and realized as an IETF
   Network Slice can be found in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   At one end of the spectrum, a virtual private wire or a virtual
   private network (VPN) may be used to build a network slice.  In these
   cases, the network slices do not require the service provider to
   isolate network resources for the provision of the service - the
   service is "virtual".

   At the other end of the spectrum there may be a detailed description
   of a complex service that will meet the needs of a set of
   applications with connectivity and service function requirements that
   may include compute resource, storage capability, and access to
   content.  Such a service may be requested dynamically (that is,

   instantiated when an application needs it, and released when the
   application no longer needs it), and modified as the needs of the
   application change.  This type of service is called an enhanced VPN
   and is described in more detail in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].  It
   is often based on Traffic Engineering (TE) constructs in the underlay
   network.

   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) [RFC8453] is a
   framework that facilitates the abstraction of underlying network
   resources to higher-layer applications and that allows network
   operators to create and supply virtual networks for their customers
   through the abstraction of the operators' network resources.

   ACTN is a toolset capable of delivering network slice functionality.
   This document outlines the application of ACTN and associated
   enabling technologies to provide network slicing in a network that
   utilizes IETF TE-based technologies.  It describes how the ACTN
   functional components can be used to support model-driven
   partitioning of resources into variable-sized bandwidth units to
   facilitate network sharing and virtualization.  Furthermore, the use
   of model-based interfaces to dynamically request the instantiation of
   virtual networks can be extended to encompass requesting and
   instantiation of specific service functions (which may be both
   physical or virtual), and to partition network resources such as
   compute resource, storage capability, and access to content.
   Finally, this document highlights how the ACTN approach might be
   extended to address the requirements of network slicing where the
   underlying network is TE-capable.

1.1.  Terminology

   As far as is possible, this document re-uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] and [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].

   Service Provider:  See "Provider" in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Consumer:  See [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Service Functions (SFs):  Components that provide specific functions
      within a network.  SFs are often combined in a specific sequence
      called a service function chain to deliver services [RFC7665].

   Resource:  Any feature including connectivity, bufferage, compute,
      storage, and content delivery that forms part of or can be
      accessed through a network.  Resources may be shared between
      users, applications, and clients, or they may be dedicated for use
      by a unique customer.

   Infrastructure Resources:  The hardware and software for hosting and
      connecting SFs.  These resources may include computing hardware,
      storage capacity, network resources (e.g., links and switching/
      routing devices enabling network connectivity), and physical
      assets for radio access.

   Service Level Agreement (SLA):  See
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   IETF Network Slice Service:  See [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

2.  Requirements for Network Slicing

   According to [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] the customer
   expresses requirements for a particular network slice by specifying
   what is required rather than how the requirement is to be fulfilled.
   That is, the customer's view of a network slice is an abstract one
   expressed as a network slice service request.

   The concept of network slicing is a key capability to serve a
   customer with a wide variety of different service needs expressed as
   SLOs/SLEs in term of latency, reliability, capacity, and service
   function specific capabilities.

   This section outlines the key capabilities required to realize
   network slicing in a TE-enabled IETF technology network.

2.1.  Resource Slicing

   Network resources need to be allocated and dedicated for use by a
   specific network slice, or they may be shared among multiple slices.
   This allows a flexible approach that can deliver a range of services
   by partitioning (that is, slicing) the available network resources to
   make them available to meet the customer's SLA.

2.2.  Network Virtualization

   Network virtualization enables the creation of multiple virtual
   networks that are operationally decoupled from the underlying
   physical network, and are run on top of it.  Slicing enables the
   creation of virtual networks as customer services.




King, et al.            Expires 8 September 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          ACTN and Network Slicing              March 2022


2.3.  Service Isolation

   A customer may request, through their SLA, that changes to the other
   services delivered by the service provider do not have any negative
   impact on the delivery of the service.  This quality is referred to
   as "isolation" [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices]
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].

   Delivery of such service isolation may be achieved in the underlying
   network by various forms of resource partitioning ranging from
   dedicated allocation of resources for a specific slice, to sharing or
   resources with safeguards.

   Although multiple network slices may utilize resources from a single
   underlying network, isolation should be understood in terms of the
   following three categorizations.

   *  Performance isolation requires that service delivery for one
      network slice does not adversely impact congestion or performance
      levels of other slices.

   *  Security isolation means that attacks or faults occurring in one
      slice do not impact on other slices.  Moreover, the security
      functions supporting each slice must operate independently so that
      an attack or misconfiguration of security in one slice will not
      prevent proper security function in the other slices.  Further,
      privacy concerns require that traffic from one slice is not
      delivered to an end point in another slice, and that it should not
      be possible to determine the nature or characteristics of a slice
      from any external point.

   *  Management isolation means that each slice must be independently
      viewed, utilized, and managed as a separate network.  Furthermore,
      it should be possible to prevent the operator of one slice from
      being able to control, view, or detect any aspect of any other
      network slice.

2.4.  Control and Orchestration

   Orchestration combines and coordinates multiple control methods to
   provide a single mechanism to operate one or more networks to deliver
   services.  In a network slicing environment, an orchestrator is
   needed to coordinate disparate processes and resources for creating,
   managing, and deploying the network slicing service.  Two aspects of
   orchestration are required:

   *  Multi-domain Orchestration: Managing connectivity to set up a
      network slice across multiple administrative domains.



King, et al.            Expires 8 September 2022                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          ACTN and Network Slicing              March 2022


   *  End-to-end Orchestration: Combining resources for an end-to-end
      service (e.g., underlay connectivity with firewalling, and
      guaranteed bandwidth with minimum delay).

3.  Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered (TE) Networks (ACTN)

   ACTN facilitates end-to-end connectivity and provide virtual
   connectivity services (such as virtual links and virtual networks) to
   the user.  The ACTN framework [RFC8453] introduces three functional
   components and two interfaces:

   *  Customer Network Controller (CNC)

   *  Multi-domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)

   *  Provisioning Network Controller (PNC)

   *  CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI)

   *  MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI)

   RFC 8453 also highlights how:

   *  Abstraction of the underlying network resources is provided to
      higher-layer applications and customer.

   *  Virtualization is achieved by selecting resources according to
      criteria derived from the details and requirements of the
      customer, application, or service.

   *  Creation of a virtualized environment is performed to allow
      operators to view and control multi-domain networks as a single
      virtualized network.

   *  A network is presented to a customer as a single virtual network
      via open and programmable interfaces.

   The ACTN managed infrastructure consists of traffic engineered
   network resources.  The concept of traffic engineering is broad: it
   describes the planning and operation of networks using a method of
   reserving and partitioning of network resources in order to
   facilitate traffic delivery across a network (see
   [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis] for more details).  In the context of
   ACTN, traffic engineering network resources may include:

   *  Statistical packet bandwidth.

   *  Physical forwarding plane sources, such as wavelengths and time
      slots.

   *  Forwarding and cross-connect capabilities.

   The ACTN network is "sliced" with each customer being given a
   different partial and abstracted topology view of the physical
   underlay network.

3.1.  ACTN Virtual Network as a Network Slice

   To support multiple customers, each with its own view of and control
   of a virtual network constructed using a server network, a service
   provider needs to partition the network resources to create network
   slices assigned to each customer.

   An ACTN Virtual Network (VN) is a customer view of a slice of the
   ACTN-managed infrastructure.  It is a network slice that is presented
   to the customer by the ACTN provider as a set of abstracted
   resources.  See [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] for a detailed
   description of ACTN VNs and an overview of how various different
   types of YANG model are applicable to the ACTN framework.

   Depending on the agreement between customer and provider, various VN
   operations are possible:

   *  Network Slice Creation: A VN could be pre-configured and created
      through static configuration or through dynamic request and
      negotiation between customer and service provider.  The VN must
      meet the network slice requirements specified in the SLA to
      satisfy the customer's objectives.

   *  Network Slice Operations: The VN may be modified and deleted based
      on direct customer requests.  The customer can further act upon
      the VN to manage the their traffic flows across the network slice.

   *  Network Slice View: The VN topology is viewed from the customer's
      perspective.  This may be the entire VN topology, or a collection
      of tunnels that are expressed as customer end points, access
      links, intra domain paths and inter-domain links.

   [RFC8454] describes a set of functional primitives that support these
   different ACTN VN operations.

3.2.  ACTN Virtual Network for and Scaling Network Slices

   Scaling considerations for network slicing are an important
   consideration.  If the service provider must manage and maintain
   state in the core of the network for every network slice then this
   will quickly limit the number of customer services that can be
   supported.

   The importance of scalability for network slices is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] and further in
   [I-D.dong-teas-enhanced-vpn-vtn-scalability].  That work notes the
   importance of collecting network slices or their composite
   connectivity constructs into groups of that require similar treatment
   in the network before realizing those groups in the network.

   The same consideration applies to ACTN VNs.  But fortunately, ACTN
   VNs may be arranged hierarchically by recursing the MDSCs so that one
   VN is realized over another VN.  This allows the VNs presented to the
   customer to be aggregated before they are instantiated in the
   physical network.

3.3.  Management Components for ACTN and Network Slicing

   The ACTN management components (CNC, MDSC, and PNC) and interfaces
   (CMI and MPI) are introduced in Section 3 and described in detail in
   [RFC8453].  The management components for network slicing are
   described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] and are known as the
   customer orchestration system, the IETF Network Slice Controller
   (NSC), and the network controller.  The network slicing management
   components are separated by the Network Slice Service Interface and
   the Network Configuration Interface, modeling the architecture
   described in [RFC8309].

   The mapping between network slicing management components and ACTN
   management components is presented visually in Figure 1 and provides
   a reference for understanding the material in Section 3.4 and
   Section 4.

3.4.  Examples of ACTN Delivering Types of Network Slices

   The examples that follow build on the ACTN framework to provide
   control, management, and orchestration for the network slice life-
   cycle.  These network slices utilize common physical infrastructure,
   and meet specific service-level requirements.

   Three examples are shown.  Each uses ACTN to achieve a different
   network slicing scenario.  All three scenarios can be scaled up in
   capacity or be subject to topology changes as well as changes of
   customer requirements.

3.4.1.  ACTN Used for Virtual Private Line

   In the example shown in Figure 2, ACTN provides virtual connections
   between multiple customer locations (sites accessed through Customer
   Edge nodes - CEs).  The service is requested by the customer (via
   CNC-A) and delivered as a Virtual Private Line (VPL) service.  The
   benefits of this model include the following.

      Site C (VPL1) and from Site B to Site C (VPL2) across the ACTN-
      managed physical network.

   *  Agile: On-demand adjustments to the connectivity and bandwidth are
      available according to the customer's requests.

   In terms of network slicing concept as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], in this example the customer
   requests a single network slice with two pairs of point-to-point
   connectivity constructs between the service demarcation points CE1
   and CE3, and CE2 and CE3 with each pair comprising one connectivity
   construct in each direction.

3.4.2.  ACTN Used for VPN Delivery Model

   In the example shown in Figure 3, ACTN provides VPN connectivity
   between two sites across three physical networks.  The requirements
   for the VPN are expressed by the users of the two sites.  The request
   is directed to the CNC, and the CNC interacts with the network
   provider's MDSC.  The benefits of this model include are as follows.

   *  Provides edge-to-edge VPN multi-access connectivity.

   *  Most of the function is managed by the network provider, with some
      flexibility delegated to the customer-managed CNC.

   In terms of network slicing concept as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], in this example the customer
   requests a single network slice with a pair of point-to-point
   connectivity constructs (one in each direction) between the service
   demarcation points at site A and site B.  The customer is unaware
   that the service is delivered over multiple physical networks.

   In the example shown in Figure 4, ACTN provides a virtual network to
   the customer.  This virtual network is managed by the customer.  The
   figure shows two virtual networks (Network Slice 1 and Network Slice
   2) each created for a different customer under the care of a
   different CNC.  There are two physical networks controlled by
   separate PNCs.  Network Slice 2 is built using resources from just
   one physical network, while Network Slice 1 is constructed from
   resources from both physical networks.

   The benefits of this model include the following.

   *  The MDSC provides the topology to the customer so that the
      customer can control their network slice to fit their needs.

   *  Applications can interact with their assigned network slices
      directly.  The customer may implement their own network control
      methods and traffic prioritization, and manage their own
      addressing schemes.

   *  Customers may further slice their virtual networks so that this
      becomes a recursive model.

   *  Service isolation can be provided through selection of physical
      networking resources through a combination of efforts of the MSDC
      and PNC.

   *  The network slice may include nodes with specific capabilities.
      These can be delivered as Physical Network Functions (PNFs) or
      Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).

4.1.  Network Slice Service Mapping from TE to ACTN VN Models

   The role of the TE-service mapping model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang] is to create a binding
   relationship across a Layer 3 Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299], Layer 2
   Service Model (L2SM) [RFC8466], and TE Tunnel model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te], via the generic ACTN Virtual Network (VN)
   model [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang].

Internet-Draft          ACTN and Network Slicing              March 2022


   The ACTN VN model is a generic virtual network service model that
   allows customers to specify a VN that meets the customer's service
   objectives with various constraints on how the service is delivered.
   A request for a network slice service may be mapped directly to a
   request for a VN.

   The TE-service mapping model [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang]
   is used to bind the L3SM with TE-specific parameters.  This binding
   facilitates seamless service operation and enables visibility of the
   underlay TE network.  The TE-service model developed in that document
   can also be extended to support other services including L2SM, and
   the Layer 1 Connectivity Service Model (L1CSM)
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-l1csm-yang] L1CSM network service models.

   Figure 5 shows the relationship between the models discussed above.

4.2.  Interfaces and Yang Models

   Figure 6 shows the three ACTN components and two ACTN interfaces as
   listed in Section 3.  The figure also shows the Device Configuration
   Interface between the PNC and the devices in the physical network.
   That interface might be used to install state on every device in the
   network, or might instruct a "head-end" node when a control plane is
   used within the physical network.  In the context of [RFC8309], the
   Device Configuration Interface uses one or more device configuration
   models.

Internet-Draft          ACTN and Network Slicing              March 2022


   The figure also shows the Network Slice Service Interface.  This
   interface allows a customer to make requests for delivery of the
   service, and it facilitates the customer modifying and monitoring the
   service.  In the context of [RFC8309], this is a customer service
   interface and uses a service model.

   When an ACTN system is used to manage the delivery of network slices,
   a network slice resource model is needed.  This model will be used
   for instantiation, operation, and monitoring of network and function
   resource slices.  The YANG model defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] provides a suitable basis
   for requesting, controlling, and deleting, network slices.

4.3.  ACTN VN Telemetry

   The ACTN VN KPI telemetry model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics] provides a way for a
   customer to define performance monitoring relevant for its VN/network
   slice via the NETCONF subscription mechanisms [RFC8639], [RFC8640],
   or using the equivalent mechanisms in RESTCONF [RFC8641], [RFC8650].

   Key characteristics of [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics]
   include the following.

   *  An ability to provide scalable VN-level telemetry aggregation
      based on a customer subscription model for key performance
      parameters defined by the customer.

   *  An ability to facilitate proactive re-optimization and
      reconfiguration of VNs/network slices based on autonomic network
      traffic engineering scaling configuration mechanisms.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for action by IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Network slicing involves the control of network resources in order to
   meet the service requirements of customers.  In some deployment
   models using ACTN, the customer is able to directly request
   modification in the behaviour of resources owned and operated by a
   service provider.  Such changes could significantly affect the
   service provider's ability to provide services to other customers.
   Furthermore, the resources allocated for or consumed by a customer
   will normally be billable by the service provider.

   Therefore, it is crucial that the mechanisms used in any network
   slicing system allow for authentication of requests, security of
   those requests, and tracking of resource allocations.

Internet-Draft          ACTN and Network Slicing              March 2022


   It should also be noted that while the partitioning or slicing of
   resources is virtual, as mentioned in Section 2.3 the customers
   expect and require that there is no risk of leakage of data from one
   slice to another, no transfer of knowledge of the structure or even
   existence of other slices.  Further, in some service requests, there
   is an expectation that changes to one slice (under the control of one
   customer) should not have detrimental effects on the operation of
   other slices (whether under control of different or the same
   customers) even within the limits allowed within the SLA.  Thus,
   slices are assumed to be private and to provide the appearance of
   genuine physical connectivity.

   Some service providers may offer secure network slices as a service.
   Such services may claim to include edge-to-edge encryption for the
   customer's traffic.  However, a customer should take full
   responsibility for the privacy and integrity of their traffic and
   should carefully consider using their own edge-to-edge encryption.

   ACTN operates using the NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040]
   protocols and assumes the security characteristics of those
   protocols.  Deployment models for ACTN should fully explore the
   authentication and other security aspects before networks start to
   carry live traffic.
