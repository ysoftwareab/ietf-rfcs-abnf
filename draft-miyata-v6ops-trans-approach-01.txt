So as    [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4] stated, we have to consider IPv6 only    node for smooth transition. On the other hand, IETF have deprecated    the NAT-PT with some reasons. And now we need to seek alternative   solutions. Before talking specific technology, we need to consider   overall strategy for translation technology.Miyata                 Expires November 24, 2008                [Page 1]Internet-Draft      Translator specification approach           May 2008Table of Contents   1.

Introduction   This memo will present an overlooking view on IPv6 deployment and   some of the necessary technologies to achieve it.1.1.  Requirements Language   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].2.  The Devices we have to take care   As [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4] stated, it is estimated that IPv4   address exhaustion coming   sooner, as early as 2010. So, preparation is required by then.   In that time, there would be IPv4 devices and IPv6 devices. And the    IPv6 devices can consist of current type and new type. The new type   means some devices which can co-exist translator very well(e.g., as   proposed by [I-D.carpenter-shanti] and    [I-D.beijnum-modified-nat-pt]). The current type means some devices   that does not care about translator(e.g., can not distinguish    translated address from native address). Also we could not expect to   modify current IPv4 devices to adopt the environment using    translator.3.  Translators in the market   As described in [RFC4966], NAT-PT has some problems. On the other   hand, there are some translator product in the market. They have    already known the problem of NAT-PT and have devised to be useful    although there are not well working standard translator    specification. It may not be the perfect solution but the products    can satisfy some requirements.4.  Translators in the future   There are some proposals for translation technology like    [I-D.carpenter-shanti] and [I-D.beijnum-modified-nat-pt]. Some of    them could require some modification on IPv6 devices to work with    translator nicely. It is desired approach to resolve most issues    listed on [RFC4966]. The important point here is design based on the   requirements.Miyata                 Expires November 24, 2008                [Page 3]Internet-Draft      Translator specification approach           May 20085.  Proposal strategy   Considering above mentioned situation, the new translators might not    be the solution for 2010. Of course we know that current of-the-shelf    translator would not be the final solution in long term view.   But both are important to support smooth and rapid IPv6 deployment.5.1. Current translator model description   The current translation technology would help smooth IPv6    introduction around 2010. But it may not be the perfect solution.    So we should know the current technology. And we should consider    what kind of technology fits what kind of situation. And we should    give recommendation how to use it.   The big advantage of this kind of document is not-keeping users and    developers waiting for the definition of new translation technology.   This kind of document should be BCPs.5.2. New translator model specification   As we realized that translator is required. But current technology    may not be the perfect solution. So we need to define the    specification to resolve issues listed on [RFC4966].   The big advantage of this kind of document is providing safety and    optimization.   This kind of document would be RFCs.5.3. Common translation rule   In chapter 3 and 4 of [RFC2765](SIIT), there are translation rule.   It is referred by NAT-PT, obsoleted by [RFC4966], and other    implementations may be compliant with the rule, since it is    reasonable and common rule.    It is useful to have such kind of documents. But now the ICMPv6    specification is revised by [RFC4443]. The translation rule should    be updated. This kind of documents should be independent from    specific translation technology. Especially, the common translation    rule for ICMP message is very important.5.4. Translator unfriendly environment   In IPv4 network, it is observed that some devices transmits IPv4    packet with value "1" in DF Field. And some filtering systems in IPv4 Miyata                 Expires November 24, 2008                [Page 4]Internet-Draft      Translator specification approach           May 2008   network drop the ICMP error message. This combination makes    communication failure as follows.    When a translator translates the packet from IPv4 packet to IPv6    packet, the packet size is increased by the differences of IP    headers. So, when the Path MTU from translator to IPv6 destination is    1500 octets, the IPv4 packet with the size of 1500 octets can not    arrive at the IPv6 destination node. In this case, the intermediate    routers, include the translator, send ICMP Error Message, Destination    Unreachable(packet too big), but the message can not arrive at the    original IPv4 sender due to intermediate filtering system. Then the    IPv4 node can not learn the Path MTU.   This problem is not only translator problem and happens in general.   But, documenting this kind of issues should be helpful to provide the    interoperability between IPv4 node and IPv6 node.6.
