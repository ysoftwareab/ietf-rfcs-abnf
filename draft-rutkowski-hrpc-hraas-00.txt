Abstract 

    The establishment of Human Rights as a Service (HRaaS) has 
    significant potential benefits. Although the generic expressions of 
    human rights in legal instruments largely precludes definitive HRaaS 
    specification, the establishment of a measurable objective is 
    compelling in the global marketplace for internet capabilities made 
    available to the public, including new virtualised NFV-SDN based 
    implementations and protocols. This HRaaS draft provides a 
    structured enumeration of human rights found in the principal global 
    legal instruments against which standards bodies can evaluate their 
    specifications, vendors can differentiate their offerings, and users 
    can compare those offerings and make informed decisions.

1. Introduction

    Seventy years ago, the first of multiple legal instruments -The 
    Universal Declaration of Human Rights -was adopted setting forth 
    global human rights. [UDHR][HRI-DOCS] It contained 30 different 
    rights and freedoms. Forty years ago, the author of some of those 
    rights headed the first major international commission created to 
    consider how new communication technologies were advancing or 
    impeding those rights. [MACBRIDE] At the time, multiple data 
    networking technologies were proliferating, Louis Pouzin had 
    developed the internet concept seven years earlier and being

Internet-Draft          Human Rights as a Service              July 2018

    implemented in multiple initiatives. [POUZIN] Senior technical 
    representatives to the Commission were projecting the developments 
    of internets over the next decade with a view to furthering human 
    rights. [MACBRIDE81] 
    
    Thirty years ago in 1988, the world's Nation=State representatives 
    convened at Melbourne to sign a treaty enabling the implementation 
    of internet public access capabilities globally subject to certain 
    constraints following the first major internet cyberattack a few 
    weeks before. [WATTC88] Twenty years ago in 1998, the U.S. 
    government initiated - CRISP -the first significant work on adverse 
    internet security and human rights challenges. [CRISP] At about the 
    same time, a trio of international actions occurred at the U.N. 
    Geneva Office of the High Commission on Human Rights which convened 
    series of conferences on emerging adverse internet human rights 
    problems, the EU Council of Ministers established the European 
    Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and the Heads of State 
    and Government of the Council of Europe at their Second Summit met 
    to seek common responses to the developments of new information 
    technologies. [OHCHR] 
    
    About fifteen years ago in 2003, thirty nations adopted "The 
    Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the 
    criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed 
    through computer systems" through the Council of Europe. [T-CY-AP] 
    
    In past several years, as internet human rights abuses have scaled 
    dramatically, a number of additional aggregate human rights have 
    evolved to deal with continuing, large-scale human rights abuses 
    such as cyberviolence, internet hate crime, and exploitation of 
    children. [WISENTHAL] [COE-CYBERVIOLENCE] 
    
    There is also an increasing recognition that while large enterprises 
    and knowledgeable may possess the resources to prevent or mitigate 
    most human rights abuses, large classes of people subject to those 
    abuses at the network edges do not possess those resources - 
    especially when manifested by nation-state actors. [DTRA-MASS] 
    Exacerbating the challenges is the use of the internet to pursue 
    pursuit of racism, xenophobia, and election manipulation agendas 
    today by national leaders as part of their political agendas. 
    [TTWEETS] 
    
    Notwithstanding the somewhat dire contemporary developments, 
    evolving new virtualised internets are emerging that could lead to 
    human rights improvements in the protocols, architectures, and 
    offerings to the public. NFV-SDN based virtualised internets are 
    rapidly emerging = especially for 5G environments. They make use of

Internet-Draft          Human Rights as a Service              July 2018

    a broad array of protocols instantiated as service functions on 
    demand. [NFVRG] In conjunction with this virtualisation, internets 
    are witnessing a major paradigm shift of intelligence from the 
    network edges to network cores and gateways. [MBOX-INNOVATE] A 
    concept of Human Rights as a Service that provides structured 
    enumerations of human rights in global legal instruments can enable
    standards bodies evaluating their specifications, vendors 
    differentiating their offerings, and users can compare those 
    offerings and making informed decisions.
    

2. Human Rights as a Service in existing and evolving internets

    Although the generic expressions of human rights in legal 
    instruments largely precludes definitive HRaaS specification. In 
    addition to the typically unstructured language and often vague 
    terminology found in these instruments, they fall into the conundrum 
    of "the fog of more." There are dozens of intergovernmental bodies 
    involved, and even more in individual countries at varying 
    governmental levels. All of these bodies have promulgated human 
    rights. It has resulted in a significant body of human right law 
    that is manifested in legal systems, law schools, and institutes 
    distributed worldwide. 
    
    Notwithstanding these challenges, the creation of structured 
    enumerations for human rights found in the principal legal 
    instruments, has potential value under the aegis of "Human Rights as 
    a Service." Such enumerations would further the objective of 
    furthering cognizance, respect, implementation, and statistical 
    monitoring of those rights in the global marketplace of internet 
    protocols, virtual functions, applications, management, practices, 
    and services offered to the public. 
    

3. Structured enumerations of human rights 

    The following subclauses provide an initial set of enumerations 
    which can be extended via a registry to encompass any legal 
    instrument of human rights.

Acknowledgments 

    Thanks to Sean MacBride who played a leading role in articulating 
    global human rights in international legal instruments, creating 
    implementing organizations, and leading the first major worldwide 
    body forty years ago to consider the potential for advancing human 
    rights in communication networks.
