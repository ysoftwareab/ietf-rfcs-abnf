                   BMP Extension for Path Marking TLV
                draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv-01

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
   BGP Path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP
   Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension
   to BMP to convey the status of a BGP path after being processed by
   the BGP best-path selection algorithm.  This extension makes use of
   the TLV mechanims described in draft-lucente-bmp-tlv
   [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv].

1.  Introduction

   For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
   the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP
   RIB after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision
   process.  The path status information is currently not carried in the
   BGP Update Message RFC4271 [RFC4271] or in the BMP Update Message
   RFC7854 [RFC7854].

   External systems can use the path status for various applications.
   The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
   troubleshooting.  Having such status stored in a centralized system
   can enable the development of tools facilitating this process.
   Optimisation systems can include the path status in their process,
   and also use the status as a validation source (since it can compare
   the calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as
   primary and backup path).  As a final example, path status

   information can complement other centralized sources of data, for
   example, flow collectors.

   This document defines a so-called Path Marking TLV to convey the BGP
   path status information to the BMP server.  The BMP Path Marking is
   defined to be prepended in the BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.

2.  Path Marking TLV for the RM Message

   As per RFC4271 [RFC4271], the BMP RM Message consists of the Common
   Header, Per-Peer Header, and the BGP Update PDU.  According to draft-
   lucente-bmp-tlv [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv] , optional trailing data in TLV
   format is allowed in the BMP RM Message to convey characteristics of
   transported NLRIs (i.e. to help stateless parsing) or vendor-specific
   data.  Such TLV types are to be defined for each application.

   To include the path status along with each BGP path, we define the
   Path Marking TLV, shown as follows.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |                       Path Type(4 octets)                     |

     |                     Reason String(Variable)                   |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                       Figure 1: Path Marking TLV

   o  Type = TBD1 (2 Octets): Path Marking.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Marking TLV.  The value field further consists of the Path-
      Status field and Reason String field.

   o  Path-Status (4 Octets): indicates the path status of the BGP
      Update PDU encapsulated in the RM Message.  Currently 8 types of
      path status are defined, as shown in Table 1.

   o  Reason String (Variable): indicates the reasons/explanations of
      the path status indicated in the Path Type field.  The detailed
      Reason String format is defined in Figure 2.

2.1.  Path Type

                     +--------+----------------------+
                     | Value  | Path type            |
                     +-------------------------------+
                     | 0x0000 | Unknown              |
                     | 0x0001 | Best path            |
                     | 0x0002 | Best external path   |
                     | 0x0004 | Primary path         |
                     | 0x0008 | Backup path          |
                     | 0x0010 | Non-installed path   |
                     | 0x0020 | Unreachable next-hop |
                     +--------+----------------------+

                          Table 1: Path Type

   The Path type field contains a bitfield where each bit encodes a
   specific role of the path.  Multiple bits may be set when a path is
   used in multiple roles.

   The best-path is defined in RFC4271 [RFC4271] and the best-external
   path is defined in draft-ietf-idr-best-external
   [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].

   A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path that can be used
   all the time as long as a walk starting from this path can end to an
   adjacency draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A
   prefix can have more than one primary path if multipath is configured
   draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations
   [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best-path is also
   considered as a primary path.

   A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used until
   some or all primary paths become unreachable.  Backup paths are used
   for fast convergence in the event of failures.

   All other reachable paths are marked as 'Non-installed'.

   Lastly, all paths that are considered unreachable are marked as
   'Unreachable next-hop'.  Unreachable paths may be sent only in some
   specific cases.

                        Figure 2: Reason String field

   The reason string fields include multiple TLVs containing freeform
   ASCII encoded messsages containing the reason of a specific path
   status.

   o  Sub Type 1 (2 Octets) = TBD2: Non-Best Reason String.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Non-Best Reason String.

   o  Non-Best Reason String (Variable): includes the reason why the
      path has a non-best status.

   o  Sub Type 2 (2 Octets) = TBD3: Uninstalled Reason String.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Uninstalled Reason String.

   o  Uninstalled Reason String (Variable): includes the reason why the
      path has an uninstalled status.

   o  Sub Type 3 (2 Octets) = TBD4: Unreachable Reason String.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Unreachable Reason String.

   o  Unreachable Reason String (Variable): includes the reason why the
      path has an unreachable status.
