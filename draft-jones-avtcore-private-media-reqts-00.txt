1. Introduction

   Users of multimedia communication products and services have privacy
   expectations that are largely satisfied with the use of SRTP
   [RFC3711] and related technologies when communicating point-to-point
   over the Internet.  When communicating in a conferencing environment
   with two or more participants, though, it is necessary for an
   endpoint to share the SRTP master key and salt with the conference
   server so that it can authenticate and decrypt received RTP and RTCP
   packets.  The conference server also needs the master key and salt in
   order to transmit media packets it receives to other participants in

   the conference.  The need for conferencing servers to have the master
   key is a security risk for users.

   Within a corporate or other isolated environment where conferencing
   servers are tightly controlled, this security risk can be effectively
   managed.  However, managing this risk is becoming increasing
   difficult as conferencing resources are being deployed in networks
   that are less than fully trusted, including virtualized conferencing
   servers deployed in cloud environments.

   There are also public voice and video conferencing service providers
   in which users must place full trust in order to use those services,
   as it is necessary for an endpoint to share the SRTP master key with
   those conferencing servers.  This exposes corporations, for example,
   to a higher risk of being subjected to corporate espionage.  While it
   is not the intent of this draft to suggest that any existing service
   provider would permit or condone any illicit use of its service, the
   fact is that security threats can come from external sources and
   remain undiscovered for long periods of time.

   It is possible to ensure communication privacy within the context of
   a switched conferencing environment with limited changes in the
   security mechanisms used today.  This document discusses this
   possibility in more detail and presents a set of requirements for
   meeting this objective.

2. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]
   when they appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

3. Terminology

   [Editor's Note: we may want to refine these or add/remove terms]

   Adversary - An unauthorized entity that may attempt to compromise the
   performance of a conference server through various means, including,
   but not limited to, the transmission of bogus media packets or
   attempt to gain access to the plaintext of the media.

   Switching conference server - A conference server that does not
   decrypt RTP media flows or perform processing on the media payload,
   but instead simply forwards the received media from a sender to the
   other participants in a multimedia conference.  A switching
   conference server may modify some RTP headers.

4. Background

   Traditional multimedia conferencing servers would mix, transcode,
   transrate, and/or recompose media flows from one or more conference
   participants, sending out a different audio and video flow to each
   participant.  For audio, this might entail mixing some number of
   input flows that appear to contain audio intended to be heard by the
   other participants, with each participant receiving a flow that does
   not contain that participant's own audio.  For video, the conference
   server may elect to send only video showing the current active
   speaker, a tiled composition of all participants or the most recent
   active speakers, a video flow with the active speaker presented
   prominently with other participants presented as thumbnail images, or
   some other composite arrangement.  It is also common for audio or
   video to be transcoded.  A typical traditional conferencing server is
   depicted in Figure 1.

                 Figure 1 - Traditional Conferencing Server

   Traditional conference servers require a significant amount of
   processing power, which in turn translates into a high cost for
   conferencing hardware manufacturers.  Significantly, too, it is very
   difficult to deploy these servers in a cloud environment due to the
   high processing demands, as the specialized hardware found in the
   traditional voice and video conferencing server does not exist in a
   cloud environment.

   To enable the traditional conferencing server to perform its job, the
   server establishes an SRTP session with each of the conference
   participants so that it can get the keys required to decrypt and
   encrypt media flows from and to each participant.  This means that
   the conference server is necessarily a fully trusted entity in the
   communication path.  Anytime these servers are deployed in a network
   that is not tightly controlled, it increases the risk that an
   attacker might gain access to cryptographic key material, thus
   allowing the attacker to be able to see and listen to ongoing
   conferences.  In some instances, depending on how the hardware is
   designed and how keys and certificates are managed, it might be
   possible for an attacker to see and listen to previously recorded
   conferences or future conferences.

   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is a profile
   of RTP, which can provide confidentiality, message authentication,
   and replay protection to the RTP traffic and to the RTP Control
   Protocol (RTCP).  Encryption of header extension in SRTP [RFC6904]
   provides a mechanism extending the mechanisms of [RFC3711], to
   selectively encrypt RTP header extensions in SRTP.  [RFC3711] and
   [RFC6904] solves end-to-end use cases between two endpoints, and does
   not consider use cases where a sender delivers media to a receiver
   via a cloud-based conferencing service.

5. Motivation for Private Media in Switched Conferencing

5.1. Switched Conferencing in Cloud Services

   There is a trend in the industry for enterprises to use cloud
   services to host multi-party conferences and meet-me services, either
   exclusively or to meet peak loads on-demand.  At the same time, there
   is huge shift toward using light-weight, cost-effective switching
   conference servers in cloud services that do not necessarily need to
   mix audio or composite/transcode video.  Also fueling the use of such
   light-weight conference servers is the desire to fully exploit
   virtualized computing resources and dynamic scalability potential
   available in cloud computing environments.

   The increased use of cloud services has exposed a problem.  There are
   two different trust domains from a media perspective: endpoints and
   other devices in a trusted domain, and conference servers controlled
   by the cloud service in an untrusted domain.  Other examples of
   conference devices spread across trusted and untrusted domains are
   likely, but the cloud service trend is triggering the urgency to
   address the need to allow for lightweight media conference while
   enabling media privacy at the same time.

   With a switching conference server, each participant transmits media
   to the server as it would with a traditional conferencing server.
   However, the switching conference server merely forwards media to the
   other participants in the conference (where the other participant may
   be associated with a cascaded conference server or an endpoint on the
   same server), leaving composition to the receiving endpoint.  Since
   some endpoints may have a limited amount of bandwidth, each endpoint
   might negotiate with the switching conference server to receive only
   a subset of the available media flows.  Each transmitting endpoint
   might also send multiple media flows of varying frame sizes and/or
   frame rates (e.g., simulcast or scalability layers), so that the
   server can select the streams most appropriate for each receiver's
   bandwidth and capabilities.  This allows, for example, an endpoint to
   receive and display higher quality video for the active speaker and
   thumbnails for other participants.  It is also worth noting that, for
   switched media to work successfully, each endpoint in the conference
   must support the media formats transmitted by all other entities in

   the conference.  More modern endpoints support multiple codecs and
   formats, making this commercially practical.

   Figure 2 depicts an example of a switching conference server wherein
   each participant is receiving the media flows transmitted by each of
   the other participants in the conference.

   Note - The use of multiple arrows directed toward each endpoint is
   not intended to suggest the use of separate RTP sessions.

   By using methods such as those described in [RFC6464], it is possible
   for the switching conference server to transmit the appropriate audio
   and video flows to conference participants without having knowledge
   of the contents of the encrypted media.  The examples that follow
   help to illustrate this point.

   In the Figure 3 below, endpoints A, B and D receive the video streams
   from endpoint C, the currently active speaker, which is receiving
   video from endpoint A, the previous active speaker.  Later when
   endpoint B becomes the active speaker (Figure 4), endpoints A, C and
   D will start to receive video from B, while endpoint B continues to
   receive video from endpoint C.  Finally in Figure 5, endpoint A
   becomes the active speaker.

   Switched conferencing can also enable conferences to scale to include
   many more simultaneous participants than would be possible with a
   traditional conferencing server.  Like traditional conferencing
   servers, switching conference servers can also be cascaded or
   interconnected in a meshed topology to increase the size of the
   conference without putting undue burden on any particular server.

5.2. Private Media Security through Switching

   A traditional conferencing server, or MCU, establishes an SRTP
   session with each participating endpoint separately, and needs
   to decrypt packets containing media presented to other endpoints.  By
   using a switching conference server, it is possible to keep the media
   encryption keys private to the endpoints such that the conference
   server does not have access to the keys used for media encryption.
   The switching conference server just forwards media received to each
   of the other participants in the conference.

   This provides for a significantly improved security model, as one
   can, for example, utilize conferencing resources in the cloud that do
   not necessarily have to be trusted.  That said, there may be
   situations where the switching conference server needs to modify the
   RTP packet received from an endpoint, such as by adding or removing
   an RTP header extension, modifying the payload type value, etc.  It
   would be the responsibility of the switching conference server to
   ensure that media of the expected type and containing the correct
   information is received by a recipient.



Jones, et al.           Expires April 27, 2015                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Private Media Requirements            October 2014


   Thus, there is a need to utilize an end-to-end encryption and
   authentication key (or pair of keys) and a hop-by-hop encryption and
   authentication key (or pair of keys).  The purpose for the hop-by-hop
   encryption key is to optionally encrypt RTP header extensions.  The
   current SRTP specification and related specifications do not define
   use of a dual-key approach presently.  However, such an approach is
   possible and would result in ensuring the privacy of media while also
   enabling the more scalable switched conferencing model.

   The assumptions with this model are that the endpoints are trusted
   entities, as they clearly have access to the media keys for
   encryption.  Some call processing functions for the administrative
   domain, such as SIP [RFC3261] proxy servers or B2BUAs, are trusted in
   exactly the same way they are with the traditional conferencing
   model, meaning they must be trusted to keep signaling secure as
   certificate information (e.g., fingerprints) might be conveyed via
   signaling.  The switching conference server is not fully trusted and
   is not given visibility into the actual contents of the SRTP payload.
   However, the switching conference server in the untrusted domain is
   at least trusted to perform its core duties of forwarding media and
   processing signaling; it simply isn't trusted with the media
   encryption keys.

   The assumption is that no changes are made to SRTCP, i.e. SRTCP is
   protected hop-by-hop with a single security context.

   This dual-key model does necessitate a change in the way that keys
   are managed.  However, the topic of key management is outside the
   scope of this requirements document.  However, high-level assumptions
   like if the end-to-end contexts use a group key as SRTP master key or
   if individual SRTP master keys (that may be derived/negotiated from
   another group key) is likely to influence the solution derived from
   this document.

6. Goals and Non-Goals

6.1. Goals

6.1.1. Ensure End-To-End Confidentiality

   The content of the communication and all media needs to be
   confidential within the group of entities explicitly invited into the
   conference.  An external monitoring adversary should not be able to
   deduce the human-to-human communication that actually occurred from
   capturing the media packets.

   At the same time, it is necessary to allow switching media servers to
   manipulate certain RTP header fields like the payload type value.

Internet-Draft        Private Media Requirements            October 2014


6.1.2. Ensure End-To-End Source Authentication of Media

   In a conference system with multiple participants it is vital that
   the multimedia content presented to any of the human participants is
   from the stated participant, and not an adversary that attempts to
   inject misleading content.  Nor should an adversary be able to fool
   the system into becoming a trusted party in the conference.  Only
   explicitly invited parties shall be able to contribute content.

6.1.3. Provide a More Efficient Service than "Full-Mesh"

   A multi-party conference that has the goals of confidentiality and
   source authentication can be established as a "full mesh" (i.e., each
   participating endpoint directly addresses each of the other
   participants).  However, this has a significant issue with the amount
   of consumed resources in both the uplink and the downlink from each
   participant.

   A switched conferencing model would yield the efficiencies desired.

6.1.4. Support Cloud-Based Conferencing

   To achieve cost-effective and scalable conferencing, it must be
   possible to run the conference node instances in a cloud-based
   virtualized environment.

   From a security standpoint, this is a significant issue since the
   virtualized server instance and the underlying hardware and software
   upon which it runs might not be secure from an adversary.

6.1.5. Limiting a User's Access to Content

   Since an invited user will be provided with the content protection
   keys, the user can decrypt content from time periods before and after
   the user joined the conference.  However, this is not always
   desirable.  It should be possible to re-key the content protection
   keys every time a user joins or leaves the conference so each
   particular set of conference participants uses a unique key.

   This also changes the trust level required on the conference roster
   handling at any point and how to keep that accurate and secured.

   It should be noted that timely completion of the re-keying operations
   become an obstacle in system design and operation.  Thus, it is a
   goal to allow for this possibility when it is deemed essential, but
   it should not be a requirement on a system to re-key each time the
   participant list changes.

6.1.6. Compatibility with the WebRTC Security Architecture

   It is a goal of this work to ensure compatibility with the WebRTC
   security architecture as described in [I.D-rtcweb-security-arch].  As
   an example, local resources that are considered a part of the trusted
   computing base (TCB), such as keying material derived using DTLS-
   SRTP, will remain within the TCB and not exposed to untrusted
   entities.

   The browser is reliant on an external calling service to convey
   signaling information that may open the door for a man-in-the-middle
   attack, such as the conveyance of certificate fingerprints over the
   interface between the browser and the calling service.  However, as
   described in [I.D-rtcweb-security-arch], the browser may utilize
   additional services, such as a trusted identify provider, to mitigate
   such risks.

6.2. Non-Goals

6.2.1. Securing the Endpoints

   The security of a communication session requires that the endpoints
   are not compromised and that the users are trustworthy.  If not,
   credentials and decrypted content may be shared with third parties.
   However, this is hard to prevent through system design.  Thus, it
   should be assumed that the endpoint is secure and the user is
   trustworthy; how to achieve this is out of scope this document.

6.2.2. Concealing that Communication Occurs

   A non-goal is to attempt to prevent a pervasive monitoring adversary
   from knowing that the communication session has occurred.  The reason
   for excluding this as a goal is that it is extremely difficult to
   achieve, as a pervasive monitoring adversary can be expected to be
   able to have knowledge of all IP flows that enter or exit local ISPs,
   across links that straddle nation borders or internet exchange
   points.  To hide the fact communication occurred, the flows required
   to achieve the communication session need to be highly difficult to
   correlate between different legs of the communication.

   At this stage this is deemed too difficult to attempt and will need
   to be a subject for further study.  Existing attempts include The
   Onion Router (TOR), against which it has been claimed to be possible
   to monitor, at least partially, by an adversary with sufficient
   reach.

   Also of consideration is that trying to conceal the fact that
   communication occurred actually makes it more difficult for network
   administrators to effectively manage and troubleshoot issues with
   conference calls.

6.2.3. Individual Media Source Authentication

   Although the participants in the conference are authenticated, it is
   not a goal to provide source authentication of the media at the
   individual user level, instead being satisfied with being able to
   authenticate media as coming from an invited conference participant
   or not.

   There exist solutions that can provide individual media source
   authentication (e.g., TESLA).  However, they impact the performance
   or security properties they provide.  Thus, further study is required
   to determine impact and resulting security properties if desired to
   have individual source authentication.

6.2.4. Support for Multicast in Switched Conferencing

   Multicast traffic is, by design, transmitted to every participant in
   a conference.  The focus of this document is only on centralized
   unicast conferencing that utilizes a switched conferencing
   architecture.

7. Requirements

   The following are the security solution requirements for switched
   conferencing that enable end-to-end media privacy between all
   conference participants.

   Note that while some switching media servers might be fully trusted
   entities, the intent of this solution and purpose for these private
   media (PM) requirements is to address those servers that are not
   fully trusted.

   PM-01:  Switching conference server MUST be able to switch the media
           between participants in a conference without having access to
           the media encryption keys.

   PM-02:  Solution MUST maintain all current SRTP security goals,
           namely the ability to provide for confidentiality, provide
           replay protection, and ensure message integrity.

   PM-03:  Solution MUST extend replay attacks protection to cover each
           hop in the media path.  It MUST be possible to detect if a
           packet received by either an endpoint or a switching
           conference server was previously received by that entity or
           if the packet is not intended for that entity.

   PM-04:  Keys used for end-to-end encryption and authentication of RTP
           payloads and other information deemed unsuitable for access
           by the switching conference server MUST NOT be generated by
           or accessible to any component that is not in the fully
           trusted domain.

Internet-Draft        Private Media Requirements            October 2014


   PM-05:  The switching conference server MUST be capable of making
           changes to the RTP header and, optionally, the RTP header
           extensions.

   PM-06:  The switching conference server, or any entity that is not
           fully trusted, MUST NOT be involved in the authentication of
           identities for the purpose of media key distribution.

   PM-07:  The switching conference server MUST be able to switch an
           already active SRTP stream to a new receiver, while
           guaranteeing the timely synchronization between the SRTP
           context of the transmitter and its current and new receivers.

   PM-08:  It MUST be possible for the switching conference server to
           determine if a received media packet was transmitted by a
           valid conference participant.

   PM-09:  It MUST be possible for a conference to be optionally re-
           keyed as desired, such as each time a participant joins or
           leaves the conference.

   PM-10:  To decrypt packets, the receiving endpoint needs to be able
           to know the SSRC and RTP sequence number used by the sending
           endpoint.  These values need to be integrity protected end-
           to-end, either explicitly by inclusion in an end-to-end MAC
           or implicitly like the MKI field in [RFC3711].
