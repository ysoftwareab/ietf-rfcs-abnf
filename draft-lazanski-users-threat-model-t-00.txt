   Internet-Draft A User-Focused Internet Threat Model      March 2020

Abstract

   RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint
   security. RFC 3552 is 15 years old and in those 15 years the threat
   landscape has changed. Security issues and cyber attacks have
   increased and there are more devices, users, and applications on the
   endpoint than ever. This draft proposes a new approach to the
   Internet threat model which will include endpoint security, focus on
   users and provide an update to the threat model in RC 3552.

1. Introduction

   Data breaches are on the rise: personal data is stolen and often
   leaked or sold on a never-before-seen scale. Malware and ransomware
   attacks impact the most vulnerable in our global societies today.
   Better security results in better privacy through prevention of
   these breaches. However, even though the IETF is privacy-focused,
   policy and design decisions taken by the IETF have radically changed
   the architecture of the Internet, arguably without due consideration
   to cyber defence implications or outcomes.

   In recent years, this has obsoleted many systems, technologies and
   programmes which use Internet protocols for prevention, detection
   and mitigation of cyber attacks. RFC 7258 established that
   "Pervasive Monitoring" is an attack on privacy that needs to be
   mitigated where possible. Furthermore, RFC 3552 assumes that the
   endpoints involved in a communications exchange have not been
   compromised, but that the attacker has near complete control over
   the network between the endpoints rather than the endpoints
   themselves.  These assumptions have led to a focus on communications

   security and the development of protocols that place this kind of
   security above all else. Ironically - or coincidentally - as the
   development of these protocols have taken place over the last
   several decades, there has been and continues to be a sharp rise in
   cyber attacks. The Internet threat model in RFC 3552 does not even
   mention that the greatest threat to the Internet is the growing
   scale and variety of cyber attacks against all types of endpoints
   that is resulting in significant data breaches. This now needs to
   change.

2. A History of Data Breaches

   A data breach is an incident where data is inadvertently exposed in
   a vulnerable system, usually due to insufficient access controls or
   security weaknesses in the software.[1] In the first six months of
   2018 alone, Gemalto reported that there were 945 data breaches
   resulting in 4.5 billion records being compromised.[2] This section
   describes some recent cyber attacks on the Internet that led to data
   breaches.

   In October 2013, Adobe announced that hackers had stolen nearly 3
   million encrypted customer credit card details and the IDs and
   encrypted passwords of 35 million customers.[3]

   In December 2013, the retailer Target announced that 40 million
   credit card records and personal details for a further 70 million
   customers had been compromised. A report from Verizon indicated that
   after one week, 86percent of passwords used by Target had been
   cracked and Verizon's security consultants were able to move about
   with complete freedom on Target's internal network.[4]

   In May 2014, eBay notified 145 million users to change their
   passwords following a cyber attack that compromised encrypted
   passwords, customer names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone
   numbers and dates of birth.[5]

   In July 2015, a commercial website that enabled extramarital affairs
   (called Ashley Madison) was breached; a month later, more than 25GB
   of company data, including user details, was leaked. The ethics and
   impact on human rights of this breach are particularly notable, as
   it resulted in at least one confirmed suicide.[6]

   In 2016, Uber was breached, giving hackers access to the names,
   email addresses and phone numbers of 57 million riders and drivers.
   600,000 US drivers had their names and license plate numbers stolen.
   The current assessment is that other personal data, including trip
   location history, credit card details, social security numbers and
   dates of birth were not downloaded. [7] Also, in August of 2016,

   Internet-Draft A User-Focused Internet Threat Model      March 2020

   Dropbox was hacked to release over 68million user email addresses
   and passwords onto the Internet. [8]

   In March 2018, as part of a coding review, Google uncovered a coding
   glitch that potentially exposed the personal data of up to 500,000
   Google Plus users, including their names, email addresses,
   occupations, genders and ages.[9] Google could not confirm which
   users were affected by the security flaw as they keep API log data
   for only two weeks (and, presumably, log data analysis was lacking
   or insufficient to detect the breach as it was happening).

   In May 2018, Twitter advised all 330 million of its users to change
   their passwords after a software exposed them in plaintext. [10]
   Additionally, in September 2018, British Airways announced that
   personal and financial details of up to 380,000 customers who had
   booked flights over a 16-day period had been stolen. This breach was
   traced to a rogue script that had been installed on the third-party
   payment supplier used by British Airways.[11]

   Also in September 2018, Facebook suffered its worst security breach
   ever; the exploitation of several simultaneous software bugs gave
   login access to as many as 50 million accounts.[12] April 2019, a
   146GB data set containing over 540 million Facebook records were
   found exposed on AWS servers, as two third-party companies had
   collected Facebook data on their own servers.[13] In November 2018,
   500 million Marriott International customers had their details
   stolen in an ongoing breach since 2014. Approximately 327 million
   hotel guests had a combination of name, address, phone number, email
   address, passport number, date of birth, gender and
   arrival/departure information stolen.[14]

   In January 2019, the personal data of more than 3500 people living
   with HIV in Singapore was leaked in Singapore, allegedly by an
   insider with access to sensitive records.[15] Also in February 2019,
   a file containing 2.2 billion compromised usernames and passwords
   was found on the dark web. This 600GB file was a collation of
   previous data breaches, truly demonstrating the scale and severity
   of the data breach and cyber defence problem in totality.[16]

   And these are only a handful of breaches that have been made public.
   So many more go unreported in the public. Data breaches are one of
   the singular most important issue in cybersecurity today. IBM's 13th
   "Cost of a Data Breach" study found that the global average cost of
   a data breach in 2018 was $3.86 million.[17] That is the average
   cost of one - not many - data breaches.

   It is unthinkable and unrealistic that any revised Internet threat
   model does not highlight the large and ongoing threat from data


Lazanski              Expires September 9, 2020                [Page 4]

   Internet-Draft A User-Focused Internet Threat Model      March 2020

   breaches, whatever their cause. Threat actors are making full use of
   the Internet technology that allows them to hide on endpoints and
   perform such large data hacks that mostly go undetected.

   Internet security researchers and developers must accept the reality
   of all the security issues in the Internet ecosystem. Decisions
   being made in the name of privacy are sometimes leading to larger
   inadvertent security and privacy losses.

3. Botnets

   A botnet is a string of connected computers used, in this case, to
   perform a malicious function against an end user, organisation or
   series of users.[18] Though computers working together to increase
   computing power for functions does not constitute a botnet in itself
   (and is used often in data centres for chat rooms or email services,
   for example) botnets are a specifically used for malicious intent.
   There have been a number of recent, high profile botnet attacks and
   only a few will be described here as examples.

   In 2000, EarthLink Spammer sent 1.25 million phishing emails over a
   year and made $3 million in profits by using fake websites and
   domain names to accomplish this. Subsequently the spammer was
   convicted and Earthlink won $25 million in damages.[19]

   Created in 2007, Cutwail was the biggest botnet on the Internet by
   2009 by number of infected computers or hosts sending email. It was
   sending 51 million emails every minute.[20] By 2010, however, it
   started a DDoS attack to nearly 300 major sites including PayPal and
   US federal agencies. By 2013 it was the botnet to use for sending
   spam, but over time its use declined through targeted attempts to
   take it offline as well as the expiration of email addresses. Though
   not as popular and sending far less than it once did, Cutwail still
   sends spam to this day.[21]

   A more recent botnet was the centre of one of the biggest outages of
   the Internet network. The Mirai botnet was first identified in 2016.
   The Mirai botnet as well as variants infect Internet of things
   devices and those infected devices scan the Internet for IP
   addresses of other Internet of Things devices, thus creating a
   multiplication of IoT devices which are infected. Though the bot
   still exists in various forms, the most serious attack took place on
   21 October 2016 when the Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn was
   attacked by DDoS using a coordinated system of infected IoT devices.
   Much of the Internet was unreachable after three attacks occurred
   during the day. Though eventually resolved on that day, the sheer
   size and scale of the attack is still viewed as one of the biggest
   attacks on the Internet to this day.[22]


Lazanski              Expires September 9, 2020                [Page 5]

   Internet-Draft A User-Focused Internet Threat Model      March 2020

   According to Kaspersky Labs, there were just over 15,000 botnet
   attacks in 2018.[23] Worryingly, of those attacks, approximately 40
   percent were new in both type and the target. Again, as IoT devices
   increase and as networks expand coverage and ability to handle even
   more devices and data, it is likely that botnet attacks willcontinue
   to be seen on such a scale.

4. Emerging Threats

   Older methods of cyber attacks are still happening and causing
   breaches, as endpoint security remains incomplete and not up to
   date. Servers remain unpatched and vulnerable and client devices
   become legacy or unsupported, to name just a few issues. In
   parallel, new categories of attacks are emerging.

   Software updates are a new attacked vector. In March 2019, Kaspersky
   uncovered the ShadowHammer supply-chain attack which injected
   malicious code into the ASUS Live Update Utility. This attack
   involved signing malicious code using stolen certificates and was
   estimated to have affected half a million users.[24] As a result of
   the ShadowHammer attack, public focus turned to how and what could
   be the point of infection. Suggestions were that the IP addresses
   could have been the point of origin of the attack while others
   suggested that the malware itself was dormant and inactive until a
   certain update triggered the malware.

   In July 2019, Godlua became the first publicly known malware to use
   DNS-over-HTTPS to avoid DNS-based malware protection security
   systems. [25] The malware uses DoH requests to determine where the
   active URL originates and where it will connect. The malware takes
   advantage of this information in order to initiate a DDoS attacks.
   The malware attacks both windows and linux systems and takes
   advantage of a backdoor exploit. [26]

   Attacks on individual consumers have dropped by nearly 40 percent,
   due to the fact that attacking one person is largely not financially
   viable, but attacks on business organisations have increased year on
   year.[27] Ransomware is on the rise, motivated by economic gain and
   the weaknesses in endpoints. Malware is freely available and the
   vulnerable attack point of an endpoint can be found. Botnets are
   increasing in size and scale as well as ease of use.

   There are other emerging threats that require more research to
   collate fully and this section is a starting point.

5. Impacts

   As noted in
   draft-arkko-farrell-arch-model-t-02 there is a difference between user
   interaction endpoints and system endpoints. Acknowledging that the
   end-to-end model supports permissionless innovation, it is
   imperative to ensure that the open and innovative nature of the
   Internet continues. However, a taxonomy of endpoints and agreement
   on those which have had the most security impact in the last 15
   years in necessary to continue this work.

   Work is underway in to attempt to catalogue the most well-known
   threats and considerations to be taken for protocol designers in
   light of these threats. This is a taxonomy of a sort along with
   basic guidelines and information.

6. Guidelines

   TODO: insert list of guidelines for protocol designers.

7. A New Internet Threat Model

   Many endpoints are vulnerable; CLESS begins a much needed research
   programme to demonstrate what capabilities and what limitations can
   be expected at the endpoint and from a variety of types of
   endpoints.[28] Endpoints have changed over the last 10 years, but
   assumptions about endpoints in the IETF hasn't changed in that time.

   Draft-iab-for-the-users-03 discusses that end users are
   beneficiaries of the IETF standards. End users use endpoints which
   have new and emerging threats. Even the user is not often in full
   control of what happens on their endpoint and what security
   protections apply to their own data a model where the Internet is
   user-centric would give more control to the user. The user is both
   the home Internet citizen and the organisation administrator seeking
   to protect against data breaches; both need the power to control
   where their data goes and choose their security protections. So
   while endpoints are the focus now, does the Internet need to be
   user-centric in the future? Won't that give users even more assure
   privacy?

   ATTACK versions of methods, when categorised by type, show that
   endpoint methods of compromise are increasing faster than network
   attacks.[29][30] This may be due to more variety in endpoints,
   substandard security in many endpoints or the difficulty of
   attacking a network compared to an endpoint. Whatever the reason,
   the logical conclusion is that the current Internet design is not
   stopping cyber attacks. Perhaps a fresh approach is required.

   Internet-Draft A User-Focused Internet Threat Model      March 2020

   As more power and control has shifted to endpoints - and even to
   only a select few applications on endpoints network defences can
   protect fewer and fewer endpoints; concurrently, attacks have
   increased and attacks have increased. The diagram above shows the
   proliferation of attacks on end points increase over a 3 and a half
   year timescale while network an physical attacks remain largely
   unchanged. Whether this is correlation or causation requires
   thorough research, essential to changing the existing threat model
   approach from its current approach.

   The existing Internet Threat Model of RFC3552 makes the general
   assumption that end-systems have not been compromised and that while
   end-systems are difficult to protect against compromise, protocol
   design can help minimise the damage.[31] Revisiting this general
   assumption in the light of the magnitude of an increase in data
   breaches and their subsequent negative results is a good starting
   point for a new Threat Model which can result in protocol design
   that helps mitigate end-system compromise.

8. Way Forward

   Additional Internet drafts on the same topic were published include
   this one and
   draft-arkko-farrell-arch-model-t-02. The logical way forward would be
   to this draft and the concurrent other two.

   RFC 3552 will need to be revised in light of the development of the
   threat landscape that has changed and grown in the 15 years since
   RFC            3552 was published. This draft highlights a selection of attacks
   and data breaches over the last decade and a half. A revision to RFC
   3552             would need to include all known and potential attack surfaces
   taking               into account mobile network development, new and emerging
   devices                which are connected to the Internet and the proliferation of
   users,               devices and applications on and over the Internet, as
   mentioned above.

   Next steps would be to identify the threat landscape and the attack
   vectors that have appeared in the 15 years and are well known since
   RFC 3552. Though threats have focused on the network side of the
   security landscape, a combined Internet draft should include an
   identification of different threats, definitions and
   classifications, examples, assumptions about the endpoints and an
   update to this Internet draft and RFC 3552 as well. Such a combined
   draft would supersede RFC 3552 and be more representative of the
   current state of play of the threat landscape.

9. Security Considerations

   This document proposes a new way of thinking about developing
   Internet security protocols and does not create, extend or modify
   any protocols. The intent is to continue discussion and bring in a
   cyber defence viewpoint.

10. IANA Considerations

   Upon publication this document has no required actions for IANA.

11. Conclusions

   The Threat Model indeed needs revisiting and changing, because cyber
   defence threats and attacks are increasing, yet the responsibility
   to help mitigate these threats and attacks is largely unrecognised
   in the IETF community.  These threats and attacks should be given
   the attention they deserve and a way forward is proposed.

   Further, it is imperative that new conclusions and recommendations
   from a revisited threat model are backed up by research, case
   studies and experience, rather than bold assertions. Research and
   evidence is important to achieve effective security, unsubstantiated
   guesswork is not.

   This draft continues to highlight the importance that any threat
   model must be based in evidence about data breaches. This draft
   continues the discussion which focuses on the user, identifies the
   current threats and proposes mitigation of those threats.
