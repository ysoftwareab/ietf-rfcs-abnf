Abstract

This document proposes to upgrade the definitions of URIs [RFC 2396]
and IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers, [IRI]) to work
consistently with internationalized domain names.

0. Change Log

0.1 Changes from -00 to -01

- Changed requirement for URI/IRI resolvers from MUST to SHOULD
- Changed IRI syntax slightly (ichar -> idchar, based on changes
   in [IRI])
- Various wording changes


1. Introduction

Internet domain names serve to identify hosts and services on the
Internet in a convenient way. The IETF IDN working group is currently
working on extending the character repertoire usable in domain names
beyond a subset of US-ASCII.

One of the most important places where domain names appear are
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs, [RFC 2396], as modified by
[RFC2732]). However, in the current definition of the generic URI
syntax, the restrictions on domain names are 'hard-coded'. In
Section 2, this document relaxes these restrictions by updating
the syntax, and defines how internationalized domain names are
encoded in URIs.

URIs are restricted to a subset of US-ASCII. However, IRIs
(Internationalized Resource Identifier [IRI]) in general allow
non-ASCII characters. But the syntax of IRIs has the same 'hard-coded'
restrictions on domain names as the syntax of URIs. In Section 3,
this document relaxes these restrictions by updating the IRI syntax.
This is done in a way that is compatible with the new syntax for URIs.
This means that encoding an internationalized domain name in an URI
and encoding the same domain name in an IRI will produce an URI and an
IRI that can be converted into each other using the procedures defined
in [IRI] for these conversions.


2. URI syntax changes

The syntax of URIs [RFC2326] currently contains the following rules
relevant to domain names:

       hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
       domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
       toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum

The later two rules are changed as follows:

       domainlabel   = escalphanum | escalphanum *( escalphanum | "-" )
                       escalphanum
       toplabel      = escalpha | escalpha *( escalphanum | "-" )
                       escalphanum

and the following rules are added:

       escalphanum   = escaped8 | alphanum
       escalpha      = elcaped8 | alpha
       escaped8      = "%" hexdig8 HEXDIG
       hexdig8       = <<HEXDIG greater than 7>>

The %HH escaping is used to encode characters outside the repertoire
of US-ASCII. This is done by first encoding the characters in UTF-8
[RFC 2279], resulting in a sequence of octets, and then escaping these
octets according to the rules defined in [RFC2396].

Using UTF-8 assures that this encoding interoperates with IRIs (see
Section 3). It is also aligned with the recommendations in [RFC 2277]
and [RFC 2718], and is consistent with the URN syntax [RFC2141] as
well as recent URL scheme definitions that define encodings of
non-ASCII characters based on UTF-8 (e.g., IMAP URLs [RFC 2192] and
POP URLs [RFC 2384]).

Please note that the use of UTF-8 for encoding internationalized
domain names in URIs is independent of the choice of encoding chosen
for these names in the DNS protocol. Depending on the choice of
encoding for the DNS protocol, an appropriate conversion is necessary.

The above syntax rules do not extend the possible domain names based
on US-ASCII characters. This is in accordance with the current direction
of the IDN WG [IDNWG].

The above rules also do not allow escaping of US-ASCII characters,
although this is allowed in the other parts of an URI (except for the
special provisions in case of reserved characters). Allowing such
escaping would make the syntax rules quite a bit more complicated,
would mean that the restrictions on US-ASCII characters can be
circumvented by using escaping, or would lead to much simpler syntax
rules that don't express these restrictions anymore.

Whether escaping of US-ASCII characters is allowed or not, two things
should be noted: 1) It is always better not to escape US-ASCII characters
in domain names because of the possibility that a resolver does not unescape
them. At least purely US-ASCII domain names would then always be resolved
by such a processor. 2) Because of the principle of syntax uniformity for
URIs, it is always more prudent to take into account the possibility that
US-ASCII characters are escaped.

Only the restrictions on US-ASCII characters are expressed in the
rules above. However, all the other restrictions on internationalized
domain names that are defined by the IDN WG [IDNWG] MUST be respected.

The work of the IDN WG currently includes some procedures for name
preparation. Before encoding an internationalized domain name in an
URI, this preparation step SHOULD be applied. However, the URI resolver
SHOULD also apply name preparation.


3. IRI syntax changes

The syntax of IRIs [IRI] currently contains the following rules
relevant to domain names:

       hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
       domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
       toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum

The later two rules are changed as follows:

       domainlabel   = intalphanum | intalphanum *( intalphanum | "-" )
                       intalphanum
       toplabel      = intalpha | intalpha *( intalphanum | "-" )
                       intalphanum

and the following rules are added:

       intalphanum   = idchar | alphanum | escaped8
       intalpha      = idchar | alpha | escaped8
       escaped8      = "%" hexdig8 HEXDIG
       hexdig8       = <<HEXDIG greater than 7>>
       idchar        = << any character of the UCS [ISO10646] of U+00A0
                          and beyond, subject to limitations in Section
                          3.1. of [IRI] >>

With respect to the allowed domain names based on US-ASCII characters,
the same considerations as in Section 2 apply.

As in Section 2, all the other restrictions on internationalized
domain names that will be defined by the IDN WG MUST be respected.
Also, before encoding an internationalized domain name in an IRI,
name preparation SHOULD be applied. However, the IRI resolver SHOULD
also apply name preparation.

It is expected that the rules in Section 3.1 of [IRI] will be less
restrictive than the rules for internationalized domain names, so that
no escaping is necessary. Nevertheless, escaping is allowed for cases
where not all characters can be directly represented.


4. Security Considerations

The security considerations of [RFC 2396] and [IRI] and those applying
to internationalized domain names apply. There may be an increased
potential to smuggle escaped US-ASCII-based domain names across
firewalls, although because of the uniform syntax principle for
URIs, such a potential is already existing.
