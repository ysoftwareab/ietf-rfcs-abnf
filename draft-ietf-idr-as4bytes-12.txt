1. Introduction

   Currently the Autonomous System number is encoded as a two-octet
   entity in BGP [BGP].  To prepare for the anticipated exhaustion of
   the two-octet AS numbers, this document describes extensions to BGP
   to carry the Autonomous System number as a four-octet entity.

   More specifically, this document defines a new BGP capability, Four-
   octet AS Number Capability, that can be used by a BGP speaker to
   indicate its support for the four-octet AS numbers.  Two new
   attributes, NEW_AS_PATH and NEW_AGGREGATOR, are introduced that can
   be used to propagate four-octet based AS path information across BGP
   speakers that do not support the four-octet AS numbers. This document
   also specifies mechanisms for constructing the AS path information
   from the AS_PATH attribute and the NEW_AS_PATH attribute.

   The extensions proposed in this document allow a gradual transition
   from 2-octet AS numbers to 4-octet AS numbers.


2. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3. Protocol Extensions

   For the purpose of this document we define a BGP speaker which does
   not support the new 4-octet AS number extensions as an OLD BGP
   speaker, and a BGP speaker which supports the new 4-octet AS number
   extensions as a NEW BGP speaker.

   BGP carries the Autonomous System number in the "My Autonomous
   System" field of the OPEN message, in the AS_PATH attribute of the
   UPDATE message, and in the AGGREGATOR attribute of the UPDATE
   message.  BGP also carries the Autonomous System number in the BGP
   Communities attribute.

   A NEW BGP speaker uses BGP Capability Advertisements [RFC2842] to
   advertise to its neighbors (either internal or external) that it
   supports 4-octet AS number extensions, as specified in this document.

   The Capability that is used by a BGP speaker to convey to its BGP
   peer the 4-octet Autonomous System number capability, also carries
   the 4-octet Autonomous System number of the speaker in the Capability
   Value field of the Capability Optional Parameter. The Capability



draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-12.txt                                  [Page 2]





Internet Draft       draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-12.txt        November 2005


   Length field of the Capability is set to 4.

   NEW BGP speakers carry AS path information expressed in terms of
   4-octet Autonomous Systems numbers by using the existing AS_PATH
   attribute, except that each AS number in this attribute is encoded
   not as a 2-octet, but as a 4-octet entity.  The same applies to the
   AGGREGATOR attribute - NEW BGP speakers use the same attribute,
   except that the AS carried in this attribute is encoded as a 4-octet
   entity.

   To preserve AS path information with 4-octet AS numbers across OLD
   BGP speakers, this document defines a new AS path attribute, called
   NEW_AS_PATH.  This is an optional transitive attribute that contains
   the AS path encoded with 4-octet AS numbers. The NEW_AS_PATH
   attribute has the same semantics as the AS_PATH attribute, except
   that it is optional transitive, and it carries 4-octet AS numbers.

   To prevent the possible propagation of confederation path segments
   outside of a confederation, the path segment types AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE
   and AS_CONFED_SET [RFC3065] are declared invalid for the NEW_AS_PATH
   attribute.

   Similarly, this document defines a new aggregator attribute called
   NEW_AGGREGATOR, which is optional transitive. The NEW_AGGREGATOR
   attribute has the same semantics as the AGGREGATOR attribute, except
   that it carries 4-octet AS numbers.

   Currently assigned 2-octet Autonomous System numbers are converted
   into 4-octet Autonomous System numbers by setting the high-order 2
   octets of the 4-octet field to zero. Such a 4-octet AS number is said
   to be mappable to a 2-octet AS number.

   To represent 4-octet AS numbers (which are not mapped from 2-octets)
   as 2-octet AS numbers in the AS path information encoded with 2-octet
   AS numbers, this document reserves a 2-octet AS number.  We denote
   this special AS number as AS_TRANS for ease of description in the
   rest of this specification. This AS number is also placed in the "My
   Autonomous System" field of the OPEN message originated by a NEW BGP
   speaker if the speaker does not have a (globally unique) 2-octet AS
   number.

4. Operations


4.1. Interaction Between NEW BGP Speakers

   A BGP speaker that supports 4-octet Autonomous System numbers MAY
   advertise this to its peers using the BGP Capability Advertisements.
   A BGP speaker that advertises such capability to a particular peer,
   and receives from that peer the advertisement of such capability MUST
   encode Autonomous System numbers as 4-octet entities in both the
   AS_PATH and the AGGREGATOR attributes in the updates it sends to the
   peer, and MUST assume that these attributes in the updates received
   from the peer encode Autonomous System numbers as 4-octet entities.

   The new attributes, NEW_AS_PATH and NEW_AGGREGATOR SHOULD NOT be
   carried in the UPDATE messages between NEW BGP peers. A NEW BGP
   speaker that receives the NEW_AS_PATH and NEW_AGGREGATOR path
   attributes in an UPDATE message from a NEW BGP speaker SHOULD discard
   these path attributes and continue processing the UPDATE message.


4.2. Interaction Between NEW and OLD BGP Speakers


4.2.1. BGP Peering

   Note that peering between a NEW BGP speaker and an OLD one is
   possible only if the NEW BGP speaker has a 2-octet AS number.
   However, this document does not assume that an Autonomous System with
   NEW speakers has to have a globally unique 2-octet AS number -
   AS_TRANS could be used instead (even if multiple Autonomous System
   would use it).


4.2.2. Generating Updates

   When communicating with an OLD BGP speaker, a NEW speaker MUST send
   the AS path information in the AS_PATH attribute encoded with 2-octet
   AS numbers. The NEW speaker also MUST send the AS path information in
   the NEW_AS_PATH attribute (encoded with 4-octet AS numbers), except
   for the case where the entire AS path information is composed of
   2-octet AS numbers only. In this case the NEW speaker SHOULD NOT send
   the NEW_AS_PATH attribute.

   In the AS_PATH attribute encoded with 2-octet AS numbers, non-
   mappable 4-octet AS numbers are represented by the well known 2-octet
   AS number, AS_TRANS. This will preserve the path length property of
   the AS path information; and will also help in updating the AS path



draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-12.txt                                  [Page 4]





Internet Draft       draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-12.txt        November 2005


   information received on a NEW BGP speaker from an OLD speaker, as
   explained in the next section.

   The NEW speaker constructs the NEW_AS_PATH attribute from the
   information carried in the AS_PATH attribute. In the case where the
   AS_PATH attribute contains either AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET
   path segments, the NEW speaker, when constructing the NEW_AS_PATH
   attribute from the AS_PATH attribute, MUST exclude such path
   segments. The NEW_AS_PATH attribute will be carried across a series
   of OLD BGP speakers without modification and will help preserve the
   truly 4-octet AS numbers in the AS path information.

   Similarly, if the NEW speaker has to send the AGGREGATOR attribute,
   and if the aggregating Autonomous System's AS number is truly
   4-octets, the speaker constructs the NEW_AGGREGATOR attributes by
   taking the attribute length and attribute value from the AGGREGATOR
   attribute and placing them into the attribute length and attribute
   value of the NEW_AGGREGATOR attribute, and sets the AS number field
   in the existing AGGREGATOR attribute to the reserved AS number,
   AS_TRANS.  Note that if the AS number is 2-octets only, then the
   NEW_AGGREGATE attribute SHOULD NOT be sent.


4.2.3. Processing Received Updates

   When a NEW BGP speaker receives an update from an OLD one, it should
   be prepared to receive the NEW_AS_PATH attribute along with the
   existing AS_PATH attribute. If the NEW_AS_PATH attribute is also
   received, both the attributes will be used to construct the exact AS
   path information, and therefore the information carried by both the
   attributes will be considered for AS path loop detection.

   Note that a route may have traversed a series of autonomous systems
   with 2-octet AS numbers and OLD BGP speakers only. In that case, if
   the route carries the NEW_AS_PATH attribute, this attribute must have
   remained unmodified since the route left the last NEW BGP speaker.
   The trailing AS path information (representing autonomous systems
   with 2-octet AS numbers and OLD BGP speakers only) is contained only
   in the current AS_PATH attribute (encoded in the leading part of the
   AS_PATH attribute).

   Under certain conditions it may not be possible to reconstruct the
   entire AS path information from the AS_PATH and the NEW_AS_PATH
   attributes of a route. This occurs when two or more routes that carry
   the NEW_AS_PATH attribute are aggregated by an OLD BGP speaker, and
   the NEW_AS_PATH attribute of at least one of these routes carries at
   least one 4-octet AS number (as oppose to a 2-octet AS number that is
   encoded in 4 octets).  Depending on the implementation, either the



draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-12.txt                                  [Page 5]





Internet Draft       draft-ietf-idr-as4bytes-12.txt        November 2005


   NEW_AS_PATH attribute would be lost during route aggregation, or both
   the AS_PATH attribute and the NEW_AS_PATH attribute would contain
   valid, partial information that can not be combined seamlessly,
   resulting in incomplete AS path information in these cases.

   A NEW BGP speaker should also be prepared to receive the
   NEW_AGGREGATOR attribute along with the AGGREGATOR attribute from an
   OLD BGP speaker.  When both the attributes are received, if the AS
   number in the AGGREGATOR attribute is not AS_TRAN, then the
   NEW_AGGREGATOR attribute and the NEW_AS_PATH attribute SHALL be
   ignored, and the AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be taken as the
   information about the aggregating node, and the AS_PATH attribute
   SHALL be taken as the AS path information; otherwise the AGGREGATOR
   attribute SHALL be ignored, and the NEW_AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be
   taken as the information about the aggregating node, and the AS path
   information would need to be constructed, as in all other cases.

   In order to construct the AS path information, it would be necessary
   to first calculate the number of AS numbers in the AS_PATH attribute
   and in the NEW_AS_PATH attribute using the method specified in Sect.
   9.1.2.2 [BGP] and [RFC3065] for route selection.

   If the number of AS numbers in the AS_PATH attribute is less than the
   number of AS numbers in the NEW_AS_PATH attribute, then the
   NEW_AS_PATH attribute SHALL be ignored, and the AS_PATH attribute
   SHALL be taken as the AS path information.

   If the number of AS numbers in the AS_PATH attribute is larger than
   or equal to the number of AS numbers in the NEW_AS_PATH attribute,
   then the AS path information SHALL be constructed by taking as many
   AS numbers and path segments as necessary from the leading part of
   the AS_PATH attribute, and then prepending them to the NEW_AS_PATH
   attribute so that the AS path information has an identical number of
   AS numbers as the AS_PATH attribute.  Note that a valid
   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET path segment SHALL be prepended
   if it is either the leading path segment or adjacent to a path
   segment that is prepended.

5. Handling BGP Communities

   As specified in [RFC1997], when the high-order two-octets of the
   community attribute is neither 0x0000 nor 0xffff, these two octets
   encode the Autonomous System number. Quite clearly this would not
   work for BGP speakers that use 4-octets Autonomous System numbers.
   Such BGP speakers should use the Four-octet AS Specific Extended
   Communities [AS-EXT-COMM] instead.


6. Transition

   The scheme described in this document allows a gradual transition
   from 2-octet AS numbers to 4-octet AS numbers. One can upgrade one
   Autonomous System or one BGP speaker at a time.

   To simplify transition this document assumes that an Autonomous
   System could start using a 4-octet AS number only after all the BGP
   speakers within that Autonomous System have been upgraded to support
   4-octet AS numbers.

   An OLD BGP speaker SHOULD NOT use AS_TRANS as its Autonomous System
   number.

   A non-mappable 4-octet AS number can not be used as a "Member AS
   Number" of a BGP Confederation until all the BGP speakers within the
   Confederation have transitioned to support 4-octet AS numbers.

   In an environment where an Autonomous System that has OLD BGP
   speakers peers with two or more Autonomous Systems that have NEW BGP
   speakers and use AS_TRANS (rather than having a globally unique AS
   number), use of Multi-Exit Discriminators by the Autonomous System
   with the OLD speakers may result in a situation where Multi-Exit
   Discriminator will influence route selection among the routes that
   were received from different neighboring Autonomous Systems.

   Under certain conditions it may not be possible to reconstruct the
   entire AS path information from the AS_PATH and the NEW_AS_PATH
   attributes of a route. This occurs when two or more routes that carry
   the NEW_AS_PATH attribute are aggregated by an OLD BGP speaker, and
   the NEW_AS_PATH attribute of at least one of these routes carries at
   least one 4-octet AS number (as oppose to a 2-octet AS number that is
   encoded in 4 octets). When such aggregation results in creating a
   route that is less specific than any of the component routes, (route
   whose NLRI covers NLRI of all the component routes), loss of the AS
   path information does not create a risk of a routing loop. In all
   other cases loss of the AS path information does create a risk of a
   routing loop.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document makes the four-octet, unsigned integers larger than
   65535 available for allocation as AS numbers. These AS numbers need
   to be managed by the IANA "Autonomous System Numbers" registry.

   This document uses a BGP Capability code to indicate that a BGP
   speaker supports the 4-octet AS numbers.  The Capability code has
   been assigned by IANA per RFC 2842.

   In addition, this document introduces two new BGP optional transitive
   attributes. The first is the NEW_AS_PATH attribute, which preserves
   the AS path information with 4-octet AS numbers across old BGP
   speakers. The second is the NEW_AGGREGATOR attribute, which is
   similar in use to the current AGGREGATOR attribute but it carries
   4-octet AS numbers.  The Type Codes for these attributes have been
   assigned by IANA.

   Finally, this document introduces a reserved 2-octet AS number -
   AS_TRANS.  The AS number for AS_TRANS has been assigned by the IANA.


8. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
