                 Encapsulation of Path Segment in SRv6
                draft-li-6man-srv6-path-segment-encap-04

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
   paths by encoding an ordered list of instructions, called "segments".
   The SR architecture can be implemented over an IPv6 data plane,
   called SRv6.  In some use-cases such as end-to-end SR Path Protection
   and Performance Measurement (PM), an SRv6 path needs to be
   identified.  This document defines the encoding of Path Segment in
   SRv6 networks.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that
   explicitly indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress
   node by inserting an ordered list of instructions, called segments.

   When segment routing is deployed on an IPv6 data plane, it is called
   SRv6, and it uses a new IPv6 [RFC8200] Routing Header (EH) called the
   IPv6 Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754] to construct an SRv6
   path.  As per [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], an SRv6
   segment identifier is a 128-bit value, which can be represented as
   LOC:FUNCT, where LOC is the L most significant bits and FUNCT is the
   128-L least significant bits.  Most often the LOC part of the SID is
   routable and leads to the node which instantiates that SID.  The
   FUNCT part of the SID is an opaque identification of a local function
   bound to the SID.

   In several use cases, such as binding bidirectional path
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path] and end-to-end performance measurement
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm], the ability to implement path
   identification is a pre-requisite.  In SRv6, it is possible to
   identify a path by the content of the segment list.  However, the
   segment list may not be a good key, since the length of the segment
   list may be too long and flexible according to the number of SIDs.

   Therefore, [I-D.li-spring-srv6-path-segment] defines an SRv6 Path
   Segment to identify an SRv6 path.

   This document defines the encoding of an SRv6 Path Segment in SRv6
   networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   PM: Performance Measurement.

   SID: Segment ID.

   SL: Segment List.

   SR: Segment Routing.

   SRH: Segment Routing Header.

   PSID: Path Segment Identifier.

   PSP: Penultimate Segment Popping.

   Further, this document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8402]
   and [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].

2.  Encoding of an SRv6 Path Segment

   This section will describe the SRH encoding of an SRv6 Path Segment
   as defined in [I-D.li-spring-srv6-path-segment].  As per
   [I-D.li-spring-srv6-path-segment], an SRv6 Path Segment is a 128-bits
   value, which identifies an SRv6 path.

2.1.  Encapsulation of SRv6 Path Segment

   The SRv6 Path Segment MUST appear only once in a SID list, and it
   MUST appear as the last entry.

   To indicate the existence of a Path Segment in the SRH, this document
   defines a P-bit in the SRH flag field.  The encapsulation of SRv6
   Path Segment is shown below.
