          1.1.  Revision History

          February 1992

          The February 1992 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number
          1.17) made the following changes:

               The ioxInfoDefaultParamId object was added to the
               ioxInfoTable.

               The ioxConX25Channel object was deleted from the
               ioxConTable and replaced with the ioxConX25CircuitId
               object.

               The ioxConX25Address object was added to the ioxConTable.

               The ioxConX25FcltyIndex, ioxConX25fcltyCcittIndex, and
               ioxConX25CallParamIndex objects were deleted from the
               ioxConTable and replaced with the ioxConX25CallParamId
               object.

               The ioxConEncapsulation and ioxConHoldDownTimer objects
               were added to the ioxConTable.

               The text at the beginning of the document was changed.

               The references were changed to match the new text.

          October 1991

          The October 91 revision of this document (Editor's internal
          reference 1.14) had the following changes:

               The object ioxInfoAddressXlationFailures was split into
               ioxInfoIpToX25LookupFailures  and
               ioxInfoX25ToIpLookupFailures. The objects
               ioxInfoLastFailedIpAddress  and
               ioxInfoLastFailedX25Address were added. This provides
               information to allow for correction of errors as well as
               detection.

               The objects ioxConX25FcltyIndex,
               ioxConX25fcltyCcittIndex, and ioxConX25CallParamIndex
               were added.

          June 1991

          The June revision of this document was synthesized from
          various ideas on how to manage IP over X.25.  This initial
          release of this document serves as a basis of discussion in
          the X25mib working group.

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
          (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
          based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
          managing IP traffic carried over X.25.  The objects defined
          here, along with the objects in the "SNMP MIB extension for
          the Packet Layer of X.25"[10], "SNMP MIB extension for
          LAPB"[9], and the "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-

          like Hardware Devices"[8], combine to allow management of IP
          traffic over an X.25 protocol stack.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  These components give the rules for
          defining objects, the definitions of objects, and the protocol
          for manipulating objects.

          The network management framework structures objects in an
          abstract information tree. The branches of the tree name
          objects and the leaves of the tree contain the values
          manipulated to effect management. This tree is called the
          Management Information Base or MIB. The concepts of this tree
          are given in RFC 1155 "The Structure of Management
          Information" or SMI [1]. The SMI defines the trunk of the tree
          and the types of objects used when defining the leaves. RFC
          1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4], defines a more
          concise description mechanism that preserves all the
          principals of the SMI.

          The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols
          can be found in RFC 1156 [2] "Management Information Base for
          Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets". RFC 1213 [5]
          defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I with changes to
          incorporate implementation experience and new operational
          requirements.

          RFC 1157 [3] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
          defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

          The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined
          for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name
          and type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset
          of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6] defined in the SMI
          [1].  Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers,
          administratively assigned names, to specify object types.  The
          object name, together with an optional object instance,
          uniquely identifies a specific instance of an object.  For
          human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
          OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to objects.

          Internet Draft         IP over X.25 MIB          February 1992


          Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language [6] provides the primitives used for this purpose.
          The SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may
          be used for simplicity and ease of implementation.  The
          encoding of an object type simply describes how to represent
          an object using ASN.1 encoding rules [7], for purposes of
          dealing with the SNMP protocol.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains the specification of all object types
          contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the
          extensions specified in "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4].

          5.  Overview

          Instances of the objects defined below represent attributes of
          an X.25 interface used to carry IP traffic. X.25 interfaces
          are identified by an ifType object in the Internet-standard
          MIB [5] of ddn-x25 or rfc877-x25.

          The relationship between the objects defined here and an
          interface as defined in the context of the Internet-standard
          MIB [5] is one-to-one.  As such, the value of an ifIndex
          object instance can be directly used to identify corresponding
          instances of the objects defined below.
