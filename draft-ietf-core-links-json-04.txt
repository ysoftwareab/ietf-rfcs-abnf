               Representing CoRE Formats in JSON and CBOR
                     draft-ietf-core-links-json-04

Abstract

   JavaScript Object Notation, JSON (RFC7159) is a text-based data
   format which is popular for Web based data exchange.  Concise Binary
   Object Representation, CBOR (RFC7049) is a binary data format which
   has been optimized for data exchange for the Internet of Things
   (IoT).  For many IoT scenarios, CBOR formats will be preferred since
   it can help decrease transmission payload sizes as well as
   implementation code sizes compared to other data formats.

   Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
   of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
   can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of
   constrained environments, it may be useful to represent these
   collections of Web links in JSON, and similarly, inside constrained
   environments, in CBOR.  This specification defines a common format
   for this.

   Group Communication for the Constrained Application Protocol
   (RFC7390) defines a number of JSON formats for controlling
   communication between groups of nodes employing the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP).  In a similar vein, this specification
   defines CBOR variants of these formats.

1.  Introduction

   Web Linking [RFC5988] provides a way to represent links between Web
   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
   of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
   can be exchanged in the CoRE link format [RFC6690] to enable resource
   discovery, for instance by using the CoAP protocol [RFC7252].

   The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] is a lightweight,
   text-based, language-independent data interchange format.  JSON is
   popular in the Web development environment as it is easy for humans
   to read and write.

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049] is a binary
   data format which requires extremely small code size, allows very
   compact message representation, and provides extensibility without
   the need for version negotiation.  CBOR is especially well suited for
   IoT environments because of these efficiencies.

   When converting between a bespoke syntax such as that defined by
   [RFC6690] and JSON or CBOR, many small decisions have to be made.  If
   left without guidance, it is likely that a number of slightly
   incompatible dialects will emerge.  This specification defines a
   common approach for translating between the CoRE-specific bespoke
   formats, JSON and CBOR formats.  Where applicable, mapping from other
   formats (e.g.  CoRE Link Format) into JSON or CBOR is also described.

   This specification defines a common format for representing CoRE Web
   Linking in JSON and CBOR, as well as the various JSON formats for
   controlling CoRE group communication [RFC7390], in CBOR.

   Note that there is a separate question on how to represent Web links
   pointing out of JSON documents, as discussed e.g. in [MNOT11].  While
   there are good reasons to stay as compatible as possible to
   developments in this area, the present specification is solving a
   different problem.

1.1.  Objectives

   This specification has been designed based on the following
   objectives:

   o  Canonical mapping

      *  lossless round-tripping with [RFC6690] and between JSON and
         CBOR

      *  but not trying for bit-preserving (DER-style) round-tripping

Internet-Draft                Links-in-JSON                November 2015


   o  The simplest thing that could possibly work

      *  Do not cater for RFC 5988 complications caused by HTTP header
         character set issues [RFC2047]

   o  Consider other work that has links in JSON, e.g.: JSON-LD, JSON-
      Reference [I-D.pbryan-zyp-json-ref]

      *  Do not introduce unmotivated differences

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear
   in this document in lower case as plain English words, absent their
   normative meanings.

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

   CoAP: Constrained Application Protocol [RFC7252]

   CBOR: Concise Binary Object Representation [RFC7049]

   CoRE: Constrained RESTful Environments, the field of work underlying
   [RFC6690], [RFC7049], [RFC7252], and [RFC7390]

   IoT: Internet of Things

   JSON: JavaScript Object Notation [RFC7159]

   The objective of the JSON and CBOR mappings defined in this document
   is to contain information of the formats specified in [RFC5988] and
   [RFC6690].  This specification therefore uses the names of the ABNF
   productions used in those documents.

2.  Web Links in JSON and CBOR

   Web Linking [RFC5988] provides a way to represent links between Web
   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
   of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
   can be exchanged in the CoRE link format [RFC6690] to enable resource
   discovery, for instance by using the CoAP protocol [RFC7252] and in

   conjunction with the CoRE resource directory
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

2.2.  Information Model

   This section discusses the information model underlying the CORE Link
   Format payload.

   An application/link-format document is a collection of web links
   ("link-value"), each of which is a collection of attributes ("link-
   param") applied to a "URI-Reference".

   We straightforwardly map:

   o  the outer collection to an array of links;

   o  each link to a JSON object or CBOR map, mapping attribute names to
      attribute values.

   In the object representing a "link-value", each target attribute or
   other parameter ("link-param") is represented by a JSON name/value
   pair (member).  The name is a string representation of the parameter
   or attribute name (as in "parmname"), the value is a string
   representation of the parameter or attribute value ("ptoken" or
   "quoted-string").  "quoted-string" productions are parsed (i.e, the
   outer quotes removed and the backslash constructions evaluated) as
   defined in [RFC6690] and its referenced documents, before placing
   them in JSON strings (where they may gain back additional decorations
   such as backslashes as defined in [RFC7159]).

   If no attribute value ("ptoken" or "quoted-string") is present, the
   presence of the attribute name is indicated by using "true" as the
   value.

   If a Link attribute ("parmname") is present more than once in a
   "link-value", its values are then represented as a JSON array of JSON
   string values; this array becomes the value of the JSON name/value
   pair where the attribute name is the JSON name.  Attributes occurring
   just once MUST NOT be represented as JSON arrays but MUST be directly
   represented as JSON strings.  (Note that [RFC6690] has cut down on
   the use of repeated parameter names; they are still allowed by
   [RFC5988] though.  No attempt has been made to decode the possibly
   space-separated values for rt=, if=, and rel= into JSON arrays.)

   The URI-Reference is represented as a name/value pair with the name
   "href" and the URI-Reference as the value.  (Rationale: This usage is
   consistent with the use of "href" as a query parameter for link-

   format query filtering and with link-format reserving the link
   parameter "href" specifically for this use [RFC6690]).

   The resulting structure can be represented in CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] as:

   links = [* link]
   link = {
     href: tstr    ; resource URI
     * tstr => tstr / true
   }

                   Figure 1: CoRE Link Format Data Model

2.3.  Additional Encoding Step for CBOR

   The above specification for JSON could be used as is for the CBOR
   encoding as well.  However, to further reduce message sizes, it is
   beneficial to perform an extra encoding step, and encode "href" and
   some commonly occurring attribute names as small integers.

   The substitution is summarized below:

                       +----------+---------------+
                       | name     | encoded value |
                       +----------+---------------+
                       | href     | 1             |
                       | rel      | 2             |
                       | anchor   | 3             |
                       | rev      | 4             |
                       | hreflang | 5             |
                       | media    | 6             |
                       | title    | 7             |
                       | type     | 8             |
                       | rt       | 9             |
                       | if       | 10            |
                       | sz       | 11            |
                       | ct       | 12            |
                       | obs      | 13            |
                       | ins      | 14            |
                       | exp      | 15            |
                       +----------+---------------+

   This list of substitutions is fixed by the present specification; no
   future expansion of the list is foreseen.  "href" as well as all
   attribute names in this list MUST be represented by their integer
   substitutions and MUST NOT use the attribute name in text form.

   This leads to the following CDDL representation for the CBOR
   encoding:

   links = [* link]
   link = {
     href: tstr    ; resource URI
     * label => tstr / true
   }
   label = tstr / &(
     href: 1,   rel: 2,        anchor: 3,
     rev: 4,    hreflang: 5,   media: 6,
     title: 7,  type: 8,       rt: 9,
     if: 10,    sz: 11,        ct: 12,
     obs: 13,
   )

3.  Group Communication Management Objects in CBOR

3.1.  Background

   The CoAP Group Communications specification [RFC7390] defines group
   management objects in JSON format.  These objects are used to
   represent IP multicast group information for CoAP endpoints.  See
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] for more examples of using these
   objects.

3.2.  Information Model

   This section discusses the information model underlying the CoAP
   Group Communication management object payload.

   A group membership JSON object contains one or more key/value pairs,
   and represents a single IP multicast group membership for the CoAP
   endpoint.  Each key/value pair is encoded as a member of the JSON
   object, where the key is the member name and the value is the
   member's value.

   The information model of the CoAP Group Communication management
   object can be summarized below:

   collection = { * index => membership }
   index = tstr .regexp "[A-Za-z0-9]{1,2}"
   membership = {
     ? n: groupname,
     ? a: groupaddress,
   }
   groupname = tstr    ; host [":" port]
   groupaddress = tstr ; IPv4address [ ":" port ]
                       ; / "[" IPv6address "]" [":" port ]

               Figure 6: CoAP Group Communication Data Model

3.3.  Mapping

   The objective of the mapping defined in this section is to map
   information from the JSON formats specified in [RFC7390] into CBOR
   format, using the rules of Section 4.2 of [RFC7049].

Appendix A.  Implementation

   This appendix provides a simple reference implementation of the
   mapping between CoRE link format and Links-in-JSON.

   (TBD - the reference implementation was used to create the above
   examples, but I still have to clean it up for readability and paste
   it in at 69 columns max.)
