Abstract

   To support flow mobility in PMIPv6, the Mobile Node's Home Network
   Prefix should be able to be shared across its attachments and the
   network should support flow-based routing.  This document specifies
   how to extend PMIPv6 to meet these requirements.

Internet-Draft       Flow mobility support in PMIPv6        October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] allows mobile nodes to connect to
   the network through multiple interfaces for simultaneous access.  The
   Mobile Node (MN) can send simultaneously packets to the PMIPv6 domain
   over multiple interfaces.  However it cannot performs flow mobility
   due to some limitations as follows:

   o  The PMIPv6 can only support IP mobility: In PMIPv6, when the
      mobile node performs handover from a network to another, all of
      the IP flows are moved to the new network.  However, the flow
      mobility requires to support moving just some of the selected
      flows to the new network, while the other flows are kept
      transmitting on the old one.

   o  The PMIPv6 can only support Per-MN-Prefix model: Basically, a home
      network prefix (HNP) can only be assigned to a single interface at
      one time.  However in a real system, multiple flows can be
      associated with a HNP.  When the flow mobility occurs, some of
      these flows are moved to a new interface, while the other flows
      are kept transmitting via the old interface.  To keep the sessions
      continuing the HNP should be preserved during the movement of the
      flows.  It means that the HNP should be able to be assigned
      simultaneously to multiple interfaces.

   o  The PMIPv6 does not support flow-based routing: Normally, the
      network can only route a packet at IP-based level.  However to
      route packet at flow-based level, it should be able to classify
      the packets at flow level and then apply the same policy to the
      packets that has the same flow information.

   To support flow mobility in PMIPv6, we first utilize the advantage of
   the logical interface at the MN to hide the changing at physical
   interfaces from the IP layer and then extend the operations of PMIPv6
   to allow the HNP to be able to be shared across interfaces as well as
   to support flow-based routing functions.


2.  PMIPv6 Extensions

   This section introduces the necessary extensions of the PMIPv6 to
   support flow mobility.

2.1.  Shared-Prefix Model Support

   The first requirement for supporting flow mobility is that the PMIPv6
   should be extended to support shared-prefix model.  Since multiple
   flows can share the same HNP and each flow can be forwarded to

   different attachment, the HNP should be shared across attachments.
   This specification recommends the implementations to extend PMIPv6 in
   two ways, proactive and reactive signaling approach.

2.1.1.  Proactive Signaling

   With the proactive signaling approach, an HNP is shared across
   attachments immediately when it is assigned to the MN.

   When the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) assigns a new HNP to the MN, it
   will immediately signal this HNP to all of the Mobile Access Gateways
   (MAG) that the MN attaches to.  By doing this, the HNPs assigned to
   the MN are always shared across its attachments in advance.
   Therefore the LMA can move flows from an attachment to another in a
   free manner without any extra signaling messages.

           Figure 1: Call flow for proactive signaling approach

   Figure 1 shows signaling call flow the of proactive signaling
   approach.  First, the MN attaches to the MAG1 using the physical
   interface IF1.  The network assigns HNP1 to the IF1.  Next, the MN
   performs new attachment via the physical interface IF2.  The MAG
   sends a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message with HI=1 to inform the
   LMA.  If the LMA recognizes that the MN can support flow mobility, it
   will assign both new HNP2 and the old HNP1 to the new attachment.
   Upon accepting this PBU message, the LMA sends a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) message including both of the HNP1 and HNP2 to
   the MAG2.  It also signals MAG1 to update with the new HNP2 by
   sending an Home Network Prefix Update Request (HUR) to the MAG1.  On
   receiving the HUR message, the MAG1 setups tunnel and routing path
   for the HNP2 and sends back an Home Network Prefix Update
   Acknowledgement Message (HUA) to inform the LMA that it is ready for
   forwarding the packets of the HNP2.

   After the above steps, both MAG1 and MAG2 can forward the packets of
   both HNP1 and HNP2.  Therefore the LMA can move flows between two
   attachments freely without any extra signaling messages.  For example
   the LMA can move the flow 1, which uses HNP1, from MAG1 to MAG2
   immediately because the MAG2 is already enabled for forwarding the
   packets of the HNP1.

   With this approach, the implementations need to do two extensions:

   o  Extend the PBA message to include both the new HNP assigned to new
      attachment and the HNPs that are already assigned to the existing
      MN's attachments.

   o  Extend the MAG and LMA to enable them to exchange HUR and HUA.

2.1.2.  Re-active Signaling

   With the re-active signaling approach, an HNP is shared with another
   attachment only when a flow is moved to an attachment which the HNP
   associated to that flow is not valid.

   When the LMA decides to move a flow and realizes that the HNP used by
   that flow is not valid on the destination MAG, it will signal the HNP
   to that MAG.  By doing this, an HNP will be shared on the destination
   MAG only when the flow associating with it is moved to a destination
   MAG that it is not valid.

   Figure 2 shows the signaling call flow of re-active signaling
   approach.  First, the MN attaches to the network using 2 interfaces,
   IF1 and IF2.  The network assigns HNP1 to the IF1 and HNP2 to the
   HNP2.  The flow 1 is forwarded by the MAG1 and uses HNP1.  When the
   LMA decides to move flow 1 to the MAG2, it signals MAG2 to update
   with the HNP1 by sending a HUR message.  On receiving the HUR
   message, the MAG2 setups routing path for the HNP1 and sends back a
   HUA message to inform the LMA that it is ready for forwarding the
   packets of HNP1.  After receiving HUA from the MAG2, the LMA can
   update flow binding table to move the flow 2 from MAG1 to MAG2.

   The key difference between proactive and reactive approach is that in
   the case of the re-active approach, the HNPs assigned to the MN is
   not shared across attachments in advance.  Each attachment will be
   assigned with a unique HNP as described in the PMIPv6 standard [1].
   The HNP1 is shared on the MAG2 only when the flow 1, which is
   associated with the HNP1, is moved to the MAG2.

   With the re-active approach, the implementations need only to extend
   the MAG and LMA to enable them to exchange HUR and HUA when the flow
   mobility occurs.

2.2.  Flow-Based Routing Support

   The second requirement for supporting flow mobility is that the
   PMIPv6 should be able to bind a particular flow to a Proxy-CoA
   without affecting other flow using the same HNP.  This specification
   allows the LMA to bind a HNP to multiple Proxy-CoAs (MAGs) and then
   allows it to bind a particular flow to a Proxy-CoA.  When the LMA
   wants to move a flow, it just changes the binding of the flow to
   another Proxy-CoA (MAG) as showed in the table Table 5 and Table 6.
   To do that the PMIPv6 need to be extended as following:

2.2.1.  Multiple Care-of Address Registration

   The LMA is extended to allow a mobile node to register multiple proxy
   care of address (Proxy-CoA), which is the same situation as described
   in the [2].  The LMA maintains multiple binding cache entries for a
   MN.  The number of binding cache entries of a MN is equal to the
   number of the MN's interfaces attaching to the MAG.

         +---------+-----+-------+------+-----------+------------+
         | BID-PRI | BID | MN-ID |  ATT |   HNP(s)  |  Proxy-CoA |

                   Table 1: The Binding Cache Entry list

   Table 1 shows two Binding Cache Entries of the MN1 when it attaches
   to the network using two different access technologies.  Both of the
   two attachments share HNP1 and are bounded to two different Proxy-
   CoAs.

2.2.2.  Flow Binding Cache Entry List

   Each LMA must maintain a flow binding table as shown in Table 1.
   This table contains entry for each flow sent from the MN.  A flow
   binding entry includes the following fields:

   o  Flow Identifier - Priority (FID-PRI)

   o  Flow Identifier (FID)

   o  Traffic Selector (TS)

   o  Binding Identifier (BID)

   o  Action

   o  Active/Idle

            +---------+-----+-----+------+---------+----------+
            | FID-PRI | FID |  TS | BIDs |  Action |    AI    |
            +---------+-----+-----+------+---------+----------+
            |    10   |  2  | TCP |   1  | Forward |  Active  |
            |    20   |  4  | UDP |  1,2 | Forward | Inactive |
            +---------+-----+-----+------+---------+----------+

                Table 2: The Flow Binding Cache Entry list

   The BIDs field contains the identifier of the binding cache entry
   that all of the packets matching the flow information described in
   the TS field will be forwarded to.  When the flow mobility occurs,
   the BIDs will be updated with new binding cache entry identifier.

   Similar to flow binding described in [3], each flow binding entry
   points to a specific binding cache entry identifier (BID).  When the
   LMA decides to move a flow, it simply updates the pointer of the flow
   binding entry with the BID of the interface to which the flow will be
   moved.  The traffic selector (TS) in flow binding table is defined as
   in [3].  TS is used to classify the packets of flows basing on
   specific parameters such as service type, source and destination
   address ...  The packets matching with the same TS will be applied
   with the same forwarding policy.

3.  Protocol Operations

3.1.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

3.1.1.  Sending Home Network Prefix Update Request Message

   When a HNP is needed to be shared on a MAG, the LMA will send an HUR
   message including the HNP to that MAG to request it to setup a tunnel
   and update the routing path for the HNP.  Depending on the way of
   implementation, proactive or reactive signaling approach, the trigger
   for sending an HUR message is different.  With proactive signaling
   approach, the HUR will be initiated whenever a new HNP is assigned to
   the MN.  In contrast, with the reactive signaling approach, the HUR
   will be initiated only when the LMA decides to move a flow and the
   HNP used by that flow is not valid on the destination MAG.

3.1.2.  Receiving Home Network Prefix Update Acknowledgement Message

   After sending HUR, the LMA waits for the HUA sent back from MAG.  On
   receiving the HUA, the LMA update binding cache to bind the HNP to an
   extra Proxy-CoA.

   Table 3 and Table 4 show the Binding Cache Entries of the MN1 before
   and after the LMA receive HUA message from the MAG2.

           +---------+-----+-------+------+--------+-----------+
           | BID-PRI | BID | MN-ID |  ATT | HNP(s) | Proxy-CoA |
           +---------+-----+-------+------+--------+-----------+
           |    20   |  1  |  MN1  | WiFi |  HNP1  |    IP1    |
           |    30   |  2  |  MN1  | 3GPP |  HNP2  |    IP2    |
           +---------+-----+-------+------+--------+-----------+

    Table 3: The Binding Cache Entry list before the LMA receiving HUA

         +---------+-----+-------+------+-----------+-----------+
         | BID-PRI | BID | MN-ID |  ATT |   HNP(s)  | Proxy-CoA |
         +---------+-----+-------+------+-----------+-----------+
         |    20   |  1  |  MN1  | WiFi |    HNP1   |    IP1    |
         |    30   |  2  |  MN1  | 3GPP | HNP1,HNP2 |    IP2    |
         +---------+-----+-------+------+-----------+-----------+

     Table 4: The Binding Cache Entry list after the LMA receiving HUA

   In the Table 3 the HNP1 is bounded to the IP1 of MAG1 only.  After
   the LMA sends HUR to request the MAG2 update with the HNP1.  Then the
   HNP1 is now also bounded IP2 of the MAG2 as showed in the Table 4

Internet-Draft       Flow mobility support in PMIPv6        October 2010


3.1.3.  Moving a Flow

   When the LMA decides to move a flow, it first checks whether the HNP
   used by that flow is valid on the destination MAG or not by checking
   the existing binding cache entries of the MN.  If it is valid, the
   LMA just updates the flow binding cache entry list with new BID.  If
   it is not valid the LMA sends HUR message to request the destination
   MAG to update with the HNP used by the flow.  After that, if the MAG
   sends an HUA message to the LMA, the LMA will update the binding
   cache entry to bind the HNP to new Proxy-CoA and then update the flow
   binding entry list with the destination BID.

   Table 5 and Table 6 show the flow binding list entry before and after
   it is updated.  In the Table 5, the flow 1 is associated with the
   binding cache entry 1.  It means that the flow 1 is forwarded via the
   Proxy-CoA of the MAG1.  After that the LMA updates the flow binding
   list entry with new binding cache entry 2.  The flow 1 is now
   associated with the Proxy-CoA 2 of the MAG2 as shown in the Table 6.
   Thus the flow 1 is successfully moved from MAG1 to MAG2.

3.2.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

3.2.1.  Receiving Home Network Prefix Update Request Message

   On receiving the HUR message, the MAG sets up its endpoint of the bi-
   directional tunnel to the LMA and also sets up the routing path for
   the traffic using HNP included in the HUR.

Internet-Draft       Flow mobility support in PMIPv6        October 2010


3.2.2.  Sending Home Network Prefix Update Acknowledgement Message

   After setting up the tunnel and routing path for new HNP
   successfully, the MAG sends HUA including the HNP to inform the LMA
   that the flows using HNP can be forwarded via the MAG.

3.3.  Mobile Node Operation

   For simplicity, we assume that the MN uses a single logical interface
   to hide all of its available physical interfaces.  The detail
   discussion about LGI is provided in [4].

   On receiving a downlink traffic flow, the MN always selects the same
   path for sending the uplink traffic flow.  For example, if the mobile
   node attaches to the network using two physical interfaces, IF1 and
   IF2.  If the downlink traffic of the flow 1 is received from the IF1
   then the uplink traffic of the flow 1 will also be sent via the IF1.
   When the flow 1 is moved to attachment of the IF2, then the path for
   sending uplink traffic of the flow 1 is also changed to the IF2.

   A new flag (F) is included in the Binding Update Massage to indicate
   to the LMA that the MN can support flow mobility.  This field is
   necessary only when the LMA cannot acquire information about flow
   mobility capacity of the MN from the MN policy profile.  In that
   case, the MN will signal the MAG about its flow mobility capacity by
   using layer 2.5 signaling message.  The MAG then set the value of F
   flag to inform the LMA about the flow mobility capacity of the MN.
   The flag MUST be set to 1 if the MN can support flow mobility and
   MUST be set to 0 if the MN cannot support flow mobility.
