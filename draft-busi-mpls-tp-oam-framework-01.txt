Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

Abstract 

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is 
   based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as 
   specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) 
   and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with 
   additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management 
   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of 
   a control plane. 

   This document provides a framework that supports a comprehensive set 
   of OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [11].

1. Introduction 

   As noted in the MPLS-TP framework [8], the overall architecture of 
   MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW 
   architectures defined in RFC 3031 [2], RFC 3985 [5] and [6] 
   complemented with additional OAM procedures for fault, performance 
   and protection-switching management for packet transport applications 
   that do not rely on the presence of a control plane. 

   In line with [12], existing MPLS OAM mechanisms will be used wherever 
   possible and extensions or new OAM mechanisms will be defined only 
   where existing mechanisms are not sufficient to meet the 
   requirements. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework provides a comprehensive set of OAM 
   procedures while satisfying the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [11]. In 
   this regard, it is similar to existing SONET/SDH and OTH OAM 
   mechanisms (e.g. [13]). 

   [Editor's note - Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this version of the draft 
   have been already reviewed by MEAD. Further revisions will be 
   undertaken and the outcome of these revisions included in the next 
   version of this draft]

   OAM flow: An OAM flow is a traffic flow between a pair of MEPs or a 
   MEP and a MIP that is used to monitor a ME [Editor's note - a MEG 
   depending on what we decide for this point]. The OAM flow is 
   associated to a unique ME and contains the OAM monitoring, signalling 
   and notification messages necessary to monitor and maintain that ME. 
   The exact mix of message types in an OAM flow will be dependent on 
   the technology being monitored and the exact deployment scenario of 
   that technology (e.g. some deployments may proactively monitor the 
   connectivity of all transport paths whereas other deployments may 
   only reactively monitor transport paths)

   OAM Message: An OAM information element that performs some OAM 
   functionality (e.g. continuity and connectivity verification) 

   OAM Packet: A packet that carries one or more OAM messages (i.e. OAM 
   information elements).

3. Functional Components 

   MPLS defines the use of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Pseudowires 
   (PWs)([2], [5] and [7]) that are used to connect service end points.  
   MPLS-TP builds on this framework the need to transport service 
   traffic, based on certain performance and quality measurements.  In 
   order to verify and maintain these performance and quality 
   measurements, we need to use the OAM functionality not only on an 
   transport paths (e.g. LSP or MS-PW), but also on arbitrary parts of 
   transport paths, defined as Tandem Connections in [10], between any 
   two arbitrary points along a path. 

   MPLS-TP OAM operates in the context of Maintenance Entities (MEs).  

   A Maintenance Entity can be viewed as the association of two (or 
   more) Maintenance End Points (MEPs), see below. The MEPs that form an 
   ME are configured and managed to limit the scope of an OAM flow 
   within the ME the MEPs belong to.

Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

   Each MEP resides at the boundaries of the ME that they are part of. 
   An ME may also include a set of zero or more Maintenance Intermediate 
   Points (MIPs), which reside within the Maintenance Entity, between 
   the MEPs.  

   A MEP is capable of initiating and terminating OAM messages for fault 
   management and performance monitoring. 

   A MIP is capable of terminating OAM messages but it generates OAM 
   messages only in reaction to received OAM messages. 

   This functional model defines the relationships between all OAM 
   entities from a maintenance perspective, to allow each Maintenance 
   Entity to monitor and manage the layer network under its 
   responsibility and easily localize problems. 

   MEPs and MIPs are associated with a particular Maintenance Entity.  

   When a control plane is not present, the management plane configures 
   MEPs and MIPs. Otherwise they can be configured either by the 
   management plane or by the control plane. 

   [Editor's note - Need to align the two paragraphs above with the 
   outcome of the on-going discussion on the mailing list regarding the 
   usage of control plane to configure OAM] 

3.1. Maintenance Entity 

   A Maintenance Entity can be viewed as the association of two (or 
   more) Maintenance End Points (MEPs). An example of an ME with more 
   than two MEPs is a point-to-multipoint ME monitoring a point-to-
   multipoint transport path (or point-to-multipoint tandem connection). 
   The MEPs that form an ME should be configured and managed to limit 
   the OAM responsibilities of an OAM flow within a network or sub-
   network, or a transport path or segment, in the specific layer 
   network that is being monitored and managed. Any maintenance point in 
   between MEPs is a Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIP). 

   A Maintenance Entity may be defined to monitor and manage 
   unidirectional point-to-point or point-to-multipoint transport paths 
   or tandem connections, or co-routed bidirectional point-to-point 
   transport paths and tandem connections in an MPLS-TP layer network.   

   MPLS-TP OAM functions are designed to be applied either on an end-to-
   end basis, e.g., between the LERs of a given LSP or T-PEs of a given 
   PW, or on a per tandem connection basis, e.g., between any LER/LSR of 
   a given LSP or any T-PE/S-PE of a given PW.

   The end points of a tandem connection are MEPs because the tandem 
   connection is by definition a Maintenance Entity.  

   Therefore, in the context of MPLS-TP LSP or PW Maintenance Entity 
   (defined below) LERs and T-PEs can be MEPs while LSRs and S-PEs may 
   be MIPs. In the case of Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (defined 
   below), LSRs and S-PEs can be either MEPs or MIPs.  

   The following properties apply to all MPLS-TP MEs: 

   o They can be nested but not overlapped, e.g. a ME may cover a 
      segment or a concatenated segment of another ME, and may also 
      include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the edge(s) of 
      the segment or concatenated segment, but all its MEPs and MIPs are 
      no longer part of the encompassing ME. It is possible that MEPs of 
      nested MEs reside on a single node. 

   o Each OAM flow is associated with a single Maintenance Entity. 

   o OAM packets are subject to the same forwarding treatment (e.g. 
      fate share) as the data traffic, but they can be distinguished 
      from the data traffic using the GAL and ACH constructs [9] for LSP 
      and the ACH construct [6] [9] for (MS-)PW.  

3.2. Maintenance End Points (MEPs) 

   Maintenance End Points (MEPs) are the end points of a ME.  MEPs are 
   responsible for activating and controlling all of the OAM 
   functionality for the ME. A MEP may initiate an OAM packet to be 
   transferred to its corresponding MEP, or to an intermediate MIP that 
   is part of the ME.  

   MEPs prevent OAM packets corresponding to a ME from leaking outside 
   that ME: 

   o A MEP sink terminates all the OAM packets that it receives 
      corresponding to its ME and does not forward them further along 
      the path. If the pro-active CC&CV OAM tool detects an unintended 
      connectivity, all traffic on the path is blocked (i.e. all 
      received packets are dropped, including user-data packets). 

   o A MEP source tunnels all the OAM packets that it receives, 
      upstream from the associated ME, via label stacking. These packets 
      are not processed within the ME as they belong to another ME.  

   [Editor's - Need to rephrase the bullet above to clarify what it 
   actually means]

   MPLS-TP MEP notifies a fault indication to the MPLS-TP client layer 
   network. 

   A MEP of a tandem connection is not necessarily coincident with the 
   termination of the MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW), though it can 
   monitor it for failures or performance degradation (e.g. count 
   packets) within the boundary of the tandem connection. 

   [Editor's note - The MEP of a TCM monitors the transport paths' 
   connectivity within the scope of the TCM. This means that failures or 
   performance degradations within the TCM are detected by the TCM MEP 
   while failures or performance degradations outside the TCM are not 
   detected by the TCM MEP. 

   Is the text above sufficient to explain this concept?] 

   A MEP of an MPLS-TP transport path coincides with transport path 
   termination and monitors it for failures or performance degradation 
   on an end-to-end scope (e.g. count packets). Note that both MEP 
   source and MEP sink coincide with transport paths' source and sink 
   terminations.[Editor's note - Add some text regarding MEP 
   identification] 

3.3. Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs) 

   A Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP) is a point between the two 
   MEPs in an ME that is capable of reacting to some OAM packets and 
   forwarding all the other OAM packets while ensuring fate sharing with 
   data plane packets.  A MIP belongs to only one ME. 

   A MIP does not initiate unsolicited OAM packets, but may be addressed 
   by OAM packets initiated by one of the MEPs of the ME. A MIP can 
   generate OAM packets only in response to OAM packets that are sent on 
   the ME it belongs to. 

   [Editor's note - It is needed to describe about how this is achieved 
   (e.g. TTL expiry). Is this description in the scope of this 
   document?] 

   MIPs are unaware of any OAM flows running between MEPs or between 
   MEPs and other MIPs. MIPs can only receive and process OAM packets 
   addressed to the MIP itself. 

   A MIP takes no action on the MPLS-TP transport path. 

   [Editor's note - Add some text regarding MIP identification]

3.4. Server MEPs 

   A server MEP is a MEP of an ME that is either: 

   o defined in a layer network below the MPLS-TP layer network being 
      referenced, or 

   o defined in a sub-layer of the MPLS-TP layer network that is below 
      the sub-layer being referenced. 

   A server MEP coincides with either a MIP or a MEP in the client 
   (MPLS-TP) layer network. 

   For example, a server MEP can be either: 

   o A termination point of a physical link (e.g. 802.3), an SDH VC or 
      OTH ODU for the MPLS-TP Section layer network, defined in section 
      4.1. ; 

   o An MPLS-TP Section MEP for MPLS-TP LSPs, defined in section 4.2. ; 

   o An MPLS-TP LSP MEP for MPLS-TP PWs, defined in section 4.4. ; 

   o An MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection MEP for higher-level LTCMEs, 
      defined in section 4.3. ; 

   o An MPLS-TP PW Tandem Connection MEP for higher-level PTCMEs, 
      defined in section 4.5.  

   The server MEP can run appropriate OAM functions for fault detection 
   within the server (sub-)layer network, and notifies a fault 
   indication to the MPLS-TP layer network. 

4. Reference Model 

   The reference model for the MPLS-TP framework builds upon the concept 
   of an ME, and its associated MEPs and MIPs, to support the functional 
   requirements specified in [11].  

   The following MPLS-TP MEs are specified in this document: 

   o A Section Maintenance Entity (SME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of MPLS-TP Sections (between MPLS LSRs). 

   o A LSP Maintenance Entity (LME), allowing monitoring and management 
      of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs).

Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

   o A PW Maintenance Entity (PME), allowing monitoring and management 
      of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs). 

   o An LSP Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (LTCME), allowing 
      monitoring and management of an LSP Tandem Connection between any 
      LER/LSR along the LSP. 

   o A MS-PW Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (PTCME), allows 
      monitoring and management of a SS/MS-PW Tandem Connection between 
      any T-PE/S-PE along the (MS-)PW. 

   The MEs specified in this MPLS-TP framework are compliant with the 
   architecture framework for MPLS MS-PWs [7] and MPLS LSPs [2]. 

   Hierarchical LSPs are also supported. In this case, each LSP Tunnel 
   in the hierarchy is a different sub-layer network that can be 
   monitored, independently from higher and lower level LSP tunnels in 
   the hierarchy, end-to-end (from LER to LER) by an LME. Tandem 
   Connection monitoring via LTCME are applicable on each LSP Tunnel in 
   the hierarchy.

           Figure 1 Reference Model for the MPLS-TP OAM Framework 

   Figure 1 depicts a high-level reference model for the MPLS-TP OAM 
   framework. The figure depicts portions of two MPLS-TP enabled 
   subnetworks, Subnetwork A and Subnetwork Z. In Subnetwork A, LSR 1 is 
   adjacent to LSR 2 via the MPLS Section Sec12 and LSR2 is adjacent to 
   LSR3 via the MPLS Section Sec23. Similarly, In Subnetwork Z, LSR X is 
   adjacent to LSR Y via the MPLS Section SecXY and LSR Y is adjacent to 
   LSR Z via the MPLS Section SecYZ. In addition, LSR 3 is adjacent to 
   LSR X via the MPLS Section 3X.  

   Figure 1 also shows a bi-directional MS-PW (PW15) between AC1 on LSR 
   1 (TPE1) and AC2 on LSR Z (TPEZ). The MS-PW consists of 3 bi-
   directional PW Segments: 1) PW Segment 1 (PW1) between LSR 1 (TPE1) 
   and LSR 3 (SPE3) via the bi-directional PSN13 LSP, 2) PW Segment 3 
   (PW3) between LSR 3 (SPE3) and LSR X (SPEX), and 3) PW Segment 5

   (PW5) between LSR X (SPEX) and LSR Z (TPEZ) via the bi-directional 
   PSNXZ LSP. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM procedures that apply to an instance of a given ME 
   are expected to operate independently from procedures on other 
   instances of the same ME and certainly of other MEs. Yet, this does 
   not preclude that multiple MEs may be affected simultaneously by the 
   same network condition, for example, a fiber cut event.  

   Note that there are no constrains imposed by this OAM framework on 
   the number, or type, of MEs that may be instantiated a particular 
   node. In particular, when looking at Figure 1, it should be possible 
   to configure one or more MEPs from the same node if each MEP shares 
   the same node. 

   The subsections below define the MEs specified in this MPLS-TP OAM 
   architecture  framework  document.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all 
   references to subnetworks, LSRs, MPLS Sections, LSP, pseudowires and 
   MEs in this Section are made in relation to those shown in Figure 1.  

   [Editor's note - Do we need to use the "Subnetwork" definition? For 
   the scope of this description, I think we could use "OAM domain" or 
   "administrative domain"] 

4.1. MPLS-TP Section Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP Section ME (SME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended 
   to monitor the forwarding behaviour of an MPLS Section as defined in 
   [10]. An SME may be configured on any MPLS section. SME OAM packets 
   fate share with the user data packets sent over the monitored MPLS 
   Section. 

   An SME is intended to be deployed for applications where it is 
   preferable to monitor the link between the topologically adjacent 
   MPLS (and MPLS-TP enabled) LSRs rather than monitoring the individual 
   LSP or PW segments traversing the MPLS Section and the server layer 
   technology does not provide adequate OAM capabilities. 

   A representative application is collecting link-level PM statistics 
   at the node-to-node interfaces (NNI) in MPLS-TP sub-network domains.

   LSR X, 4) SecXY ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR X and 
   LSR Y, and 5) SecYZ ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR Y 
   and LSR Z. 

4.2. MPLS-TP LSP End-to-End Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP LSP ME (LME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor the forwarding behaviour of an end-to-end LSP between two 
   (e.g., a point-to-point LSP) or more (e.g., a point-to-multipoint 
   LSP) LERs. An LME may be configured on any MPLS LSP. LME OAM packets 
   fate share with user data packets sent over the monitored MPLS-TP 
   LSP. 

   An LME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor the forwarding behaviour of an entire LSP between its 
   LERs, rather than, say, monitoring individual PWs. A representative 
   application is collecting PM statistics of PSN LSP that is being used 
   to provide a "tunnelling services" for a number of other LSPs.

                Figure 3 Examples of MPLS-TP LSP MEs (LME) 

   Figure 3 depicts 2 LMEs configured in the path between AC1 and AC2: 
   1) the PSN13 LME between LER 1 and LER 3, and 2) the PSNXZ LME 
   between LER X and LER Y. Note that the presence of a PSN3X LME in 
   such a configuration is optional, hence, not precluded by this 
   framework. For instance, the SPs may prefer to monitor the MPLS-TP 
   Section between the two LSRs rather than the individual LSPs.  

4.3. MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection Monitoring ME (LTCME) is an MPLS-TP 
   maintenance entity intended to monitor the forwarding behaviour of an 
   LSP tandem connection between a given pair of LSRs. Multiple LTCMEs 
   MAY BE configured on any LSP. The LSR may or may not be immediately 
   adjacent at the MPLS-TP layer. LTCME OAM packets fate share with the 
   user data packets sent over the monitored LSP segment. 

   A LTCME can be defined between the following entities: 

        o LER and any LSR of a given LSP. 

        o Any two LSRs of a given LSP.  

   An LTCME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of an LSP rather than 
   the entire LSP itself. A representative application is when there is 
   a need to monitor a part of an LSP that extends beyond the 
   administrative  boundaries  of  an  MPLS-TP  enabled  administrative 
   domain. 

   Note that LTCMEs are equally applicable to hierarchical LSPs.

        Figure 4 MPLS-TP LSP Tandem Connection Monitoring ME (LTCME) 

   Figure 4 depicts a variation of the reference model in Figure 1 where 
   there is an end-to-end PSN LSP (PSN1Z LSP) between PE1 and PEZ. PSN1Z 
   LSP consists of, at least, three stitched LSP Segments: PSN13, PSN3X 
   and PSNXZ. In this scenario there are two separate LTCMEs configured 
   to monitor the forwarding behaviour of the PSN1Z LSP: 1) a LTCME 
   monitoring the PSN13 LSP Segment on Subnetwork 123 (PSN13 LTCME), and 
   2) a LTCME monitoring the PSNXZ LSP Segment on Subnetwork XYZ (PSNXZ 
   LTCME). 

   It is worth noticing that LTCMEs can coexist with the LME monitoring 
   the end-to-end LSP and that LTCME MEPs and LME MEPs can be coincident 
   in the same node (e.g. PE1 node supports both the PSN1Z LME MEP and 
   the PSN13 LTCME MEP). 

4.4. MPLS-TP PW Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP PW ME (PME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor the end-to-end forwarding behaviour of a SS-PW or MS-PW 
   between a pair of T-PEs. A PME MAY be configured on any SS-PW or MS-
   PW. PME OAM packets fate share with the user data packets sent over 
   the monitored PW.

Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

   A PME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor the forwarding behaviour of an entire PW between a pair of 
   MPLS-TP enabled T-PEs rather than monitoring the LSP aggregating 
   multiple PWs between PEs. A representative application is on either 
   SS-PW or MS-PW used to emulate traffic for which an SLA with QoS 
   commitments may apply (e.g., an emulated DS1/E1 or the emulated CBR 
   connection of an ATM VCC/VPC).

   PW3 and PW5 and its associated end-to-end PME (PW15 PME). 

4.5. MPLS-TP MS-PW Tandem Connection Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP MS-PW Tandem Connection Monitoring ME (PTCME) is an MPLS-
   TP maintenance entity intended to monitor the forwarding behaviour of 
   an MS-PW tandem connection between a given pair of PEs. Multiple 
   PTCMEs MAY be configured on any MS-PW. The PEs may or may not be 
   immediately adjacent at the MS-PW layer. PTCME OAM packets fate share 
   with the user data packets sent over the monitored MS-PW Segment. 

   A PTCME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o T-PE and any S-PE of a given MS-PW 

   o Any two S-PEs of a given MS-PW. It can span several PW segments.  

   A PTCME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of a MS-PW rather than 
   the entire end-to-end PW itself. A representative application is to 
   collect PM statistics for the MS-PW Segment within a given network 
   domain of an inter-domain PW.

        Figure 6 MPLS-TP MS-PW Tandem Connection Monitoring (PTCME) 

   Figure 6 depicts the same MS-PW (PW15) between AC1 and AC2 as in 
   Figure 5. In this scenario there are two separate PTCMEs configured 
   to monitor the forwarding behaviour of PW15: 1) a PTCME monitoring 
   the PW1 MS-PW Segment on Subnetwork 123 (PW1 PTCME), and 2) a PTCME 
   monitoring the PW4 MS-PW Segment on Subnetwork XYZ with (PW5 PTCME). 

   It is worth noticing that PTCMEs can coexist with the PME monitoring 
   the end-to-end MS-PW and that PTCME MEPs and PME MEPs can be 
   coincident in the same node (e.g. TPE1 node supports both the PW15 
   PME MEP and the PW1 PTCME MEP). 

5. OAM Functions for pro-active monitoring 

5.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 

   Proactive Continuity and Connectivity Verification (CC & CV) function 
   is used to detect loss of continuity (LOC), unexpected connectivity 
   between two MEs (e.g. mismerging or misconnection) as well as 
   unexpected connectivity within the ME with an unexpected MEP. 

   Proactive CC & CV is based upon the generation of OAM pro-active 
   CC/CV packets, carrying a unique ME identifier, at a regular 
   configurable timing rate and the detection of LOC when these packets 
   do not arrive. If the received ME identifier does not match the 
   expected ME identifier, a connectivity defect has occurred. The 
   default CC/CV transmission periods are application dependent (see 
   section 5.1.1. )

Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

   [Editor's Note - CC packets should be transmitted with the "minimum 
   loss-probability PHB". Is PHB configurable? If not, how the PHB for 
   CC is decided?] 

   For statically provisioned connections, the transmission period and 
   the ME identifier are statically configured at both MEPs. For 
   dynamically established connections, the transmission period and the 
   ME identifier are signaled via the control plane. 

   In a bidirectional point-to-point transport path, when a MEP is 
   enabled to generate pro-active CC/CV packets with a configured 
   transmission period, it also expects to receive pro-active CC/CV 
   packets from its peer MEP with the same transmission period. In a 
   unidirectional transport path (point-to-point or point-to-
   multipoint), only the source MEP is enabled to generate packets with 
   CC/CV information. This MEP does not expect to receive any packets 
   with CC/CV information from its peer MEPs in the ME. 

   MIPs as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM are 
   transparent to the pro-active CC/CV information and forward pro-
   active CC/CV packets as regular data packets. 

   When CC & CV is enabled, a MEP periodically transmits pro-active 
   CC/CV packets with frequency of the configured transmission period. 

   When a MEP enabled to receive pro-active CC/CV packets 

   When CC & CV is enabled, a MEP detects loss of continuity (LOC) 
   defect with a peer MEP when it receives no pro-active CC/CV packets 
   from the peer MEP within the interval equal to 3.5 times the 
   transmission period. 

   When a pro-active CC/CV packet is received, a MEP is able to detect a 
   mis-connectivity defect (e.g. mismerge or misconnection) with another 
   ME when the received packet carries an incorrect ME identifier 

   If pro-active CC/CV packets are received with a transmission period 
   different than expected, CC/CV period mis-configuration defect is 
   detected. 

   [Editor's note - We need to understand whether a mechanism for auto-
   negotiate the actual transmission period such that in case of period 
   mis-configuration the two MEPs converge on the slower speed is 
   required. It is anyway important to report to the operator the fact 
   that the negotiated speed mismatches the configured one. Do we need 
   to add some text to capture the capability to auto-negotiate the rate 
   between MEPs?]

   [Editor's note - Need to add the defect clearing conditions] 

   A receiving MEP notifies the equipment fault management process when 
   it detects the above defect conditions. 

   If a MEP detects an unexpected connectivity it MUST block all the 
   traffic (including also the user data packets) that it receives from 
   the misconnected connection. 

   It is worth noticing that the OAM requirements document [11] 
   recommends that CC-CV proactive monitoring is enabled on every ME in 
   order to reliably detect connectivity defects. 

   However, CC-CV proactive monitoring can be disabled by an operator on 
   a ME. In this case a dLOC can be a connectivity problem (e.g. a 
   misconnection with a connection where CC-CV proactive monitoring is 
   not enabled) and not necessarily a continuity problem, with a 
   consequent wrong traffic delivering.  

   For these reasons, the traffic block consequent action SHOULD be 
   applied even when a LOC condition occurs. 

   The activation of the traffic block consequent action should be 
   configurable (i.e. it should be possible to enable/disable the 
   consequent action) in case of LOC condition; that in order to 
   enable/disable the proactive CC-CV monitoring on a ME in a not 
   traffic affecting way. 

5.1.1. Applications for proactive CC & CV function 

   CC & CV is applicable for fault management, performance monitoring, 
   or protection switching applications. 

   o Fault Management: default transmission period is 1s (i.e. 
      transmission rate of 1 packet/second) 

   o Performance Monitoring: default transmission period is 100ms (i.e. 
      transmission rate of 10 packets/second) 

   o Protection Switching: in order to achieve sub-50ms recovery time 
      the default transmission period is 3.33ms (i.e. transmission rate 
      of 300 packets/second) although a transmission period of 10ms can 
      also be used. In some cases, when a slower recovery time is 
      acceptable, it is also possible to relax the transmission period. 

   [Editor's note - We can turn this into something more formulaic. 
   Given a desired switching time of Xms, and a hardware switching time

   of Yms, and an OAM message propagation time of Zms, the transmission 
   period should be set to no greater than t = (X-Y-Z)/n assuming that 
   switchover will not be triggered until n protection switching 
   messages have failed to be received.] 

5.2. Remote Defect Indication 

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is 
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal 
   fail condition exists.  RDI is only used for bidirectional 
   connections and is associated with proactive CC & CV packet 
   generation. 

   [Editor's note - Add more specific information about the signal fail 
   conditions reported by RDI.] 

   A MEP that has identified a signal fail related defect should include 
   the RDI in all pro-active CC/CV packets that it generates for the 
   duration of the signal fail condition existence. 

   A MEP that receives the packets with the RDI information should 
   determine that its peer MEP has encountered a defect condition 
   associated with a signal fail (i.e. detect an RDI defect). 

   MIPs should be transparent to the RDI indicator and transparently 
   forwards pro-active CC/CV packets that include the RDI indicator, 
   i.e. the MIP should not perform any actions nor examine the 
   indicator. 

   When the signal fail condition clears, the MEP should clear the RDI 
   indicator from subsequent transmission of pro-active CC/CV packets.   

   A MEP also clears the RDI defect upon reception of a pro-active CC/CV 
   packet from the source MEP with the RDI indicator cleared. 

5.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support RDI indication, the RDI transmission rate and PHB 
   of the MEP should be configured as part of the CC & CV configuration. 

5.2.2. Applications for Remote Defect Indication 

   RDI is applicable for the following applications: 

   o Single-ended fault management - A receiving MEP detects the RDI 
      defect condition, which when correlated with other defect 
      conditions in the receiving MEP may become a fault case.

Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

   o Contribution to far-end performance monitoring - The indication of 
      the far-end defect condition is used as input to the performance 
      monitoring process. 

5.3. Alarm Suppression 

   Alarm Indication Signal function (AIS) is used to suppress alarms 
   following detection of defect conditions at the server (sub) layer. 

   o Packets with AIS information can be issued at a MEP, including a 
      Server MEP, upon detecting signal fail conditions.  

   A server MEP is responsible for notifying the MPLS-TP layer network 
   MEP upon fault detection in the server layer network to which the 
   server MEP is associated. 

   Only Server MEPs can issue MPLS-TP packets with AIS information. Upon 
   detection of a signal fail condition the Server MEP can immediately 
   start transmitting packets with AIS information periodically. A 
   Server MEP continues to transmit periodic packets with AIS 
   information until the signal fail condition is cleared. 

   Upon receiving a packet with AIS information a MEP detects an AIS 
   defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity alarms associated 
   with all its peer MEPs.  A MEP resumes loss of continuity alarm 
   generation upon detecting loss of continuity defect conditions in the 
   absence of AIS condition. 

   Specific configuration information required by a MEP to support AIS 
   transmission is the following: 

   o PHB - identifies the per-hop behaviour of packet with AIS 
      information. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with AIS information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support AIS functionality.

6. OAM Functions for on-demand monitoring 

6.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 

   In order to preserve network resources, e.g. bandwidth, processing 
   time at switches, it may be preferable to not use continual pro-
   active CC & CV.  In order to perform fault management functions 
   network management may invoke periodic on-demand bursts of on-demand 
   CC/CV packets.  Use of on-demand CC & CV is dependent on the 
   existence of a bi-directional connection ME. 

   An additional use of on-demand CC & CV would be to detect and locate 
   a problem of connectivity when a problem is suspected or known based 
   on other tools.  In this case the functionality will be triggered by 
   the network management in response to a status signal or alarm 
   indication. 

   On-demand CC & CV is based upon generation of on-demand CC/CV packets 
   that should uniquely identify the ME that is being checked.  The on-
   demand functionality may be used to check either an entire ME (end-
   to-end) or between a MEP to a specific MIP. 

   On-demand CC & CV may generate a one-time burst of on-demand CC/CV 
   packets, or be used to invoke periodic, non-continuous, bursts of on-
   demand CC/CV packets.  The number of packets generated in each burst 
   is configurable at the MEPs, and should take into account normal 
   packet-loss conditions.  

   When invoking a periodic check of the ME, the source MEP should issue 
   a burst of on-demand CC/CV packets that uniquely identifies the ME 
   being verified.  The number of packets and their transmission rate 
   should be pre-configured and known to both the source MEP and the 
   target MEP or MIP.  The source MEP should use the TTL field to 
   indicate the number of hops necessary, when targeting a MIP and use 
   the default value when performing an end-to-end check [IB => This is 
   quite generic for addressing packets to MIPs and MEPs so it is better 
   to move this text in section 2].  The target MEP/MIP shall return a 
   reply on-demand CC/CV packet for each packet received.  If the 
   expected number of on-demand CC/CV reply packets is not received at 
   source MEP, a LOC state is detected. 

   [Editor's note - We need to add some text for the usage of on-demand 
   CC&CV with different packet sizes, e.g. to discover MTU problems.]

Internet-Draft   MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview         March 2009 
    

   When a connectivity problem is detected (e.g. via a pro-active CC&CV 
   OAM tool), on demand CC&CV tool can be used to check the path.  The 
   series should check CC&CV from MEP to peer MEP on the path, and if a 
   fault is discovered, by lack of response, then additional checks may 
   be performed to each of the intermediate MIP to locate the fault. 

6.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   For on-demand CC & CV the MEP should support configuration of number 
   of packets to be transmitted/received in each burst of transmissions 
   and the transmission rate should be either pre-configured or 
   negotiated between the different nodes. 

   In addition, when the CC & CV packet is  used to check connectivity 
   toward a target MIP, the number of hops to reach the target MIP 
   should be configured. 

   The PHB of the on-demand CC/CV packets should be configured as well. 

   [Editor's note - We need to be better define the reason for such 
   configuration]

8. Security Considerations 

   A number of security considerations important in the context of OAM

   OAM traffic can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, 
   performance data and details about e.g. the network topology. The 
   nature of OAM data therefore suggests to have some form of 
   authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will 
   prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will prevent 
   third parties from learning about sensitive information about the 
   transport network. 

   Mechanisms that the framework does not specify might be subject to 
   additional security considerations. 

9. IANA Considerations 

   No new IANA considerations.
