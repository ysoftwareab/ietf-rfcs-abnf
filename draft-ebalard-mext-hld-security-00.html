<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> MIPv6 defines the concept of Home Network for a MN, in
       opposition to the foreign network where this entity may find
       itself. A ``Home Link Detection'' mechanism is also specified
       to allow the MN to detect when it is at home.
</p>
<p> MIPv6 specification mandates the use of IPsec for protecting
       main signaling traffic and also defines how IPsec can be used to
       protect data traffic between the MN and its HA. Even if
       optional, it is expected that many deployments of MIPv6 will
       use it by default for MN which may roam outside a trusted
       infrastructure (e.g. outside a mobile operator network).  
</p>
<p>When a MN detects it is at home, it is expected to stop IPsec
       protection for data traffic exchanged with its Home Agent. That
       event is the result of the Home Return procedure, triggered by
       the Home Link Detection mechanism.
</p>
<p>This document discusses the possible threats and security
	 impacts associated with the use of this insecure NDP-based
	 mechanism as a trigger to drop IPsec protection of data
	 traffic for the MN. It also provides some results on the
	 implementation of the attacks against an existing MIPv6
	 module. Possible solutions are suggested.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Scope</h3>

<p>MIPv6 entities (MN and HA) perform Neighbor Discovery
	Protocol exchanges, for various needs:<br />
<br />
 
	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the HA: acting as a ND proxy for registered MN which
	      are currently in a foreign network, the HA defends the
	      MN's HoA on the MN's Home Link when it is away,
	      intercepts packets destined to the HoA and tunnels them
	      to the associated MN at its CoA. Its operations as a ND
	      Proxy for MN's HoA are basically subject to the same ND 
	      threats as the ones existing for common neighbors of the
	      link. Those are not covered in the
	      document.<br />
<br />
  
	      
	      In practice, additional hypothesis can be made about the
	      Home Network; Being part of a controlled infrastructure,
	      those threats can be reduced, mitigated or
	      avoided. <br />
<br />
  
	      
	      As discussed in next item dedicated to the MN, those
	      hypothesis can usually not be made about the foreign
	      networks where the MN operates. <br />
<br />
 
	    
</li>
<li> the MN: upon movement, the MN performs link layer
	      interactions with the new foreign network it finds
	      itself in. By default, from a security standpoint, those
	      foreign networks must be considered as hostile
	      environments (i.e. with possible attackers). This
	      hypothesis may be relaxed in specific deployments where
	      the MN is expected to roam only between trusted networks
	      (e.g. mobile operator networks). We do not consider these
	      relaxed/specific hypothesis in the
	      document.<br />
<br />

	      
	      The interactions of the MN on foreign networks can be
	      summarized the following way: it sends RS messages in
	      order to get some RA from the router(s) of the link. The
	      RA gathered during the router discovery steps are used
	      by the MN to configure a CoA and most importantly to
	      detect if the current link is the home link or a foreign
	      link.<br />
<br />
 
	      
	      For that reason, the MN in this potentially hostile
	      environment is subject to ND protocol threats, already
	      described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3756'>[RFC3756]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nikander, P., Kempf, J., and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	      
	      But because the Home Link detection mechanism is based
	      on information gathered using NDP and may be the trigger
	      for some additional critical security steps, it may be a
	      vector for additional MIPv6 threats.
	    
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p> Specifically, this document focuses on the MIPv6-specific
	  link layer security issues associated with home link
	  detection (and Home Return procedure). It discusses the
	  possible security issues associated with current definition
	  of those mechanisms, lack of security considerations on
	  those mechanisms and inacurracies in reference documents.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Hypothesis</h3>

<p> For the reasons introduced in <a class='info' href='#scope'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scope</span><span>)</span></a>, one
	  important hypothesis made in the document is that tunneled
	  traffic (data and possibly some specific signaling messages)
	  is protected using IPsec in tunnel mode, even if not
	  mandated by the reference documents. Some arguments justify
	  this decision:<br />
<br />
     
	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> The Home Agent and the Mobile Node belong to a common 
	      trust domain, and are already expected to support IPsec
	      and share common credentials for protecting signaling
	      with IPsec in transport mode. In that context,
	      supporting tunnel mode is expected to be inexpensive
	      from a deployment standpoint. The main remaining point
	      in this discussion is the possible performance cost of
	      handling IPsec protected data traffic in the home
	      network. 
	    
</li>
<li> As specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and
	      <a class='info' href='#RFC4877'>[RFC4877]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V. and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised 	    IPsec Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, ``Tunnel mode IPsec ESP MUST
	      be supported and SHOULD be used for the protection of
	      packets belonging to the return routability
	      procedure''.
	    
</li>
<li> Protection of IPsec payload traffic is documented for
	      both static and dynamic keying with IKEv1
	      <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and IKEv2
	      <a class='info' href='#RFC4877'>[RFC4877]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V. and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised 	    IPsec Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Various implementations are
	      known to support it.
	    
</li>
<li> Except for specific devices which will operate on some
	      trusted operator or internal networks, Mobile Nodes are
	      expected to find themselves in untrusted/hostile foreign
	      networks. In that context, corporate deployments will
	      require the use of IPsec for tunneled data. Public
	      deployments will also probably follow that path.
	    
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>In the end, as discussed later in this section, IPsec
	  tunneling and common (IPv6-in-IPv6) tunneling of data are
	  basically handled in the same way with regard to home
	  return.

Theoretical threats</h3>

<p>The security aspects of the Home Link Detection mechanism
	  and ``Returning Home'' procedure are not covered in any of
	  the MIPv6 reference documents. Those are basically not
	  considered as possible threat vectors. One possible reason
	  for that may be the fact that protection of data traffic
	  (authentication, privacy, ...) is not considered in the
	  documents (support and use of IPsec for that purpose is

Full deregistration attack</h3>

	  which has an interesting Section 5 entitled ``Exploiting
	  Neighbor Discovery in a MIPv6 Environment''. That section
	  being quite short, it is provided (text is extracted from
	  current version, i.e. version 2)  here for completeness and
	  commented below as an initial introduction to the possible
	  threats:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  ...

  This threat offers a malicious node two edges.  It requires first
  that the attacker be attached to the same foreign link as the MN,
  and the discovery of the MN's home agent IP address as well as the
  MN's IP home address (which may not pose a serious problem).  After
  learning these two information, the attacker advertises the MN's
  home prefix on the link thus leading the MN to believe that it has
  returned to its home network.  Such information will prompt the MN
  to send a BU message to its HA to request de-registration.
  However, such early de-registration may not be possible as the
  foreign network may have activated ingress filtering.  But the main
  goal for the attacker is to get a valid copy of the MN's BU message
  and such goal is achieved.  If the malicious node concludes that
  the MN is still receiving data packets tunneled by the HA to its
  current CoA, then it will get involved in the MN de-registeration
  procedure by forwarding the BU message to the MN's HA on another
  interface where ingress filtering is not activated (i.e. under the
  assumption that the attacker is multihomed).  Upon receiving the
  BU message, the HA will de-register the MN and stops tunneling data
  packets to the MN's CoA. In addition, the HA sends back a BA
  message which will never reach the MN.  From that moment, the data
  traffic sent by the CN(s) stops at the MN's home network.  However,
  the lack of ACK messages sent by the MN will prompt the CN(s) at
  some point to halt sending data traffic and eventually tear down
  the session(s).
</pre></div><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  However, the situation gets worse if the malicious node decides to
  push further in his attack by sending fake ACK messages to the
  CN(s), i.e. using the MN's home address.  In such situation, the
  CN(s) will keep sending data traffic to the MN's HA (where they
  eventually get discarded) and thus, may cause severe disruption
  within the home access network, possibly leading to a network
  flooding attack in some specific topologies.
</pre></div><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  Note that as they may be more than one MN attached to the same
  foreign link and using the same home prefix, such attack may lead
  to collective de-registration.

  ...
</pre></div>
<p>As discussed in the draft and predicted by the summary
	  provided previously, it is expected to be quite easy for an 
	  attacker on a foreign link to have a MN think that it is at
	  home and have it send a de-registration BU. For that
	  purpose, as noted in the draft, the attacker only needs to
	  acquire the Home Agent address, its Home Prefix and have the
	  ability to forge packets. The addresses are public
	  information available from the traffic of the MN.
	
</p>
<p>The draft introduces the possibility that ingress filtering 
	  implemented in the foreign network could lead to the BU
	  being dropped before hitting the HA.
	
</p>
<p>In fact, for a common HAO-free deregistration BU packet
	  sent by a MN to its HA while believing it is at home, the
	  source address of the packet is the HoA. With that
	  hypothesis, the packet is both topologically invalid from
	  the foreign network's perspective (it should be dropped if
	  some filtering mechanism has been put in place by the ISP of
	  the foreign site or  even the administrator of the site),
	  but it is also invalid from the destination site's
	  perspective (it should definitely be dropped at the MN's
	  network site boundaries). But those expectations do not
	  provide any real security guarantees.
	
</p>
<p>The solution proposed in the draft for the attacker is to 
	  relay its packets via another connection mean which does not 
	  undergo ingress filtering. It is interesting to note that it 
	  will still not work if the Home Network implements ingress
	  filtering too, and the attacker (and the MN) will never get
	  a Binding Ack in response. The only way for an attacker
	  would be to have a simultaneous access to the MN's foreign
	  network and to its home network. 
	
</p>
<p>Let's be wild and consider for a moment that an
	  implementation does not have restrictions (both from the MN
	  packet build perspective and the HA processing perspective)
	  on the expected format of the BU. This could be the case
	  because of code reuse. In that context, there are some
	  paths the attacker may explore. For instance, if the
	  attacker manages to get access to the ESP protected
	  deregistration BU sent by the MN in its expected common
	  format (while believing it is at home):
	
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      IPv6 header (source = HoA,
                   destination = HA address)
      ESP header in transport mode
      Mobility header
         Binding Update
</pre></div>
<p>It could simply modify the packet in the following way to
	  add a destination option header with an HAO to make it look
	  that way:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      IPv6 header (source = Attacker_Address,
                   destination = HA address)
      Destination Options header
         Home Address option (HoA)
      ESP header in transport mode
      Mobility header
         Binding Update
</pre></div>
<p>The packet is still perfectly valid at all
	levels:<br />
<br />

	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> The part protected by ESP has not been modified during
	      the addition so it should still be gracefully processed
	      by the HA IPsec stack. It is expected that the
	      processing of the HAO be performed before the IPsec
	      processing, hence replacing the attacker address
	      (Attacker_Address) by the HoA.
</li>
<li>Mobility Header checksum is computed based on MH
	      content (which has not been modified) and using the
	      usual L4 pseudo header which is also the same after the
	      changes: the final addresses are still the HoA and the
	      Home Agent address, the next header field is still
	      MH. The last element of the pseudo header, the length of
	      the upper layer is not bound to the modified payload
	      length field of the IPv6 header but to the unchanged
	      length field of the MH header.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>In the end, the mangled packet now has a more interesting
	  layout: it has a topologically valid source address which will
	  allow it to be routed to the HA. For previous reasons, it
	  should be processed successfully by the IPsec stack of the HA
	  and delivered to its MIPv6 module. Then, whether it will be
	  considered valid by the HA is a  matter of implementation and
	  interpretation of the reference documents. Among the
	  remaining questions/points, we can list the following:
	  <br />
<br />

	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>There is no AltCoA in the packet: in our example, there
	      is none. But, here again, reference documents are not
	      clear on the topic. AltCoA is usually expected in BU to
	      benefit from the IPsec protection. But there are specific
	      non normative notes in <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and
	      <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> for deregistration BU sent from
	      Home: usual ones do not include the AltCoA option. This
	      point is mainly left as an implementation issue. For
	      instance, the Mobile IPv6 implementation for Linux
	      (UMIP) always includes the AltCoA option, even for
	      deregistration BU sent when back home.
	    
</li>
<li> Under the assumption that the HA processes the BU, can
	      we expect it to send the BA in the same fashion, using a
	      RH2? This is clearly implementation dependent. From a
	      specification point of view, the BA is expected to be
	      always sent to the source address of initial packet. In
	      our example, Attacker_Address.
	    
</li>
<li> Will the attacker be able to mangle received BA and have
	      it be processed by the MN? For the same reasons as the
	      ones given above, this may be possible.
	    
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p> As a temporary summary, the specific implementation of the
	  MIPv6 module running on the MN and the HA, the kind of
	  filtering implemented in the foreign and home networks will
	  impact the difficulty and requirements of setting up a full
	  BU/BA exchange leading to a complete deregistration on both
	  sides.

Partial deregistration</h3>

<p> It is interesting to note that the final goal of the
	  attacker may not be to mount a full deregistration attack,
	  but to have the MN drop its IPsec tunnel protection. In that
	  context, a full attack would obviously do the job but some
	  less difficult solutions may exist.
</p>
<p> For instance, the reference documents leave quite some
	  latitude with respect to the order of events. For obvious
	  performance reasons, it is common for a MIPv6 modules not to
	  wait for the BA from its HA to start using its new
	  address. In the context of the deregistration when coming
	  back home, the MN may drop its IPsec tunnel protection
	  early, just after sending its BU and before receiving the
	  BA. Mobile IPv6 for Linux implementation (UMIP) can be
	  configured to do that.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Conclusion</h3>

<p> As a conclusion, the Home Link Detection mechanism rely on
	  untrusted and spoofable ND information. It is used as a
	  trigger for a significant security event when IPsec is used
	  for protecting data between the MN and its HA: the removal of
	  this IPsec tunnel protection on a foreign network.
</p>
<p> Moreover, various parts of the reference documents leave quite
	  some room for the build and processing of packets and the order
	  of events associated with deregistration and Home Return. It may
	  lead to interoperability issues and may also simplify the
	  work of an attacker which intend to exploit previous flaws.
</p>
<p> From our standpoint, when IPsec is used to protect data
	  traffic, even if an attacker manages to access the Home Subnet
	  of a MN, this should not provide her the ability to have one
	  such MN drop its IPsec protection on a foreign network. At the
	  moment, current MIPv6 reference documents may allow that to
	  happen.

MN's configuration and behavior</h3>

<p>In this section, a Linux MN running UMIP is considered,
	  configured in order for signaling and data traffic to be
	  IPsec-protected. The former undergoing transport mode
	  protection and the latter tunnel mode protection.
</p>
<p> One configuration parameter of interest in the following
	discussions is OptimisticHandoff option. It has the following 
	description in the software man page:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
   When a Mobile Node sends a Binding Update to the Home Agent, no
   Route Optimized or reverse tunneled traffic is sent until a
   Binding Acknowledgement is received. When enabled, this option
   allows the Mobile Node to assume that the binding was successful
   right after the BU has been sent, and does not wait for a
   positive acknowledgement before using RO or reverse tunneling.
</pre></div>
<p> Even if the option is disabled by default it is useful 
	  to limit the effect of the RTT between the MN and its HA
	  when performing a handover. For that reason, chances are
	  high client will enable it.
</p>
<p> It should be noted that the effect of the option is
	    (unintentionally?) different whether the MN performs a
	    movement to a foreign network or to the home network. 
</p>
<p> In former case, when the option is enabled, directly
	    after sending its BU, the MN migrates the tunnel endpoint
	    of its tunnel mode IPsec SP/SA (and warns the IKE daemon
	    of the change of CoA) as usual but also removes a blocking
	    rule for traffic which would normally be kept until the BA
	    is received. From the user perspective, the switch has
	    already happened, even if the HA has not yet acknowledged
	    it with a BA. 
</p>
<p> In latter case, when the option is enabled, all the
	    changes required for the direct unprotected communication
	    of the MN on its Home Link are done directly after the
	    emission of the BU. Nonetheless, a rule which prevents
	    packets sent from the HoA to flow remains until the
	    protected BA is received from the HA. In the end, while
	    waiting for the BA, the MN does process unprotected
	    traffic sent to its HoA but is unable to reply (i.e. sent
	    traffic back from its HoA).
</p>
<p> Previous behavior when the OptimisticHandoff option is
	    enabled deserves some comments:

	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Considering the latency argument (RTT of the BU/BA
	    exchange) does not hold when the MN comes back home, the
	    fact that UMIP also performs a optimistic handoff in this 
	    situation looks like a bug or at least a bad idea.
</li>
<li> The rule preventing traffic from the HoA until the
	    reception of the BA seems inconsistent with the rest of
	    the code (it may be here by luck).
</li>

Attacker announcing a MN's Home Network Prefix</h3>

<p> This subsection documents the effect on a UMIP-based

	address).

        +----------+
</pre></div>
<p> As introduced in previous subsection, the behavior of an
	UMIP MN vary based on the value of the OptimisticHandoff
	configuration parameter. If it is disabled (the default), the
	MN is unable to communicate before the IPsec protected BA is
	received from the HA. In that case, the attack results in a
	DoS, but does not allow the attacker to directly send traffic
	to node or access traffic sent by the node. 
</p>
<p> When the OptimisticHandoff option is enabled, reception of
	  the RA advertising the Home Network prefix of the MN
	  directly leaves the MN without IPsec protection on the
	  attacker's link. As covered in previous subsection, a
	  residual blackhole route which is only dropped after the
	  reception of the BA by the MN prevents it to leak data

Attacker relaying BU/BA via HAO/RH2 addition</h3>

<p> As described in previous subsection, an attacker only
	advertising the Home Network Prefix to an UMIP MN may be able,
	depending on the specific configuration of the peer, to have
	it drop the IPsec tunnel protecting data traffic.
</p>
<p> At most, in the best software configuration for the
	attacker (OptimisticHandoff enabled on the MN), this may allow
	it to have traffic sent to the peer on its HoA. The inability
	for the MN to send traffic back from the HoA (blackhole rule
	installed until the reception of the BA) will prevent TCP
	connection to happen.
</p>
<p> Now, as explained in the first part of the document, the
	  attacker can improve the attack by mangling ESP-protected
	  deregistration BU sent by the peer (to the attacker, which
	  the MN believes to be its HA) and then resend it to the
	  HA. The setup is depicted on the following picture:

</pre></div>
<p> The attacker now has two interfaces (it may be possible
	  to mount the attack with one interface but this is not
	  presented for clarity reasons), one on which it interacts
	  with the MN and the other which it uses to send/receive
	  packets to/from the HA. On that second interface, its
	  address (used in following descriptions) is
	  2001:db8::4:207:40ff:fe53:e1e4. 
</p>
<p> The HA is available at 2001:db8::2:21e:bff:fe4e:3b2, the
	  Home Subnet of the MN being 2001:db8:0:2::/64. The MN's HoA
	  is 2001:db8::2:20d:93ff:fe55:8f79. 
</p>
<p> Extending the code developed for previous attack
	  basically involves mangling the packet in the following way 
	  (Scapy/Python code):
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  ...

  ipv6 = pkt[IPv6]     # access IPv6 layer from received packet
  esp  = ipv6.payload  # ESP-protected BU follows IPv6 layer
  ipv6.payload = None  # Remove IPv6 payload from packet
  del(lower.plen)      # Delete length to have it recomputed

  # Build HAO in DestOpt with NH set to 50 (ESP)
  hao      = HAO(hoa=ipv6.src)
  destopt  = IPv6ExtHdrDestOpt(options=[hao], nh=50)
  ipv6.src = attacker_addr # used to send packet

  # Set IPv6 NH value to DestOpt
  ipv6.nh = 60

  # Result is made of mangled IPv6 pkt, followed by Destination
  # Option header carrying the HAO, followed by the (unchanged)
  # ESP-protected BU
  p = ipv6 / destopt / esp

  ...
</pre></div>
<p>For clarity, the ESP-protected BU received by the
	  attacker from the MN after having sent the RA and announced
	  itself as the MN's HA has the following layout:

<p> Its source address is now the address of the attacker
	  (2001:db8::4:207:40ff:fe53:e1e4) which provides it
	  connectivity to the internet in order to reach the HA (the
	  unmodified destination address found in the IPv6 header of
	  the packet, i.e. 2001:db8::2:21e:bff:fe4e:3b2). The address
	  of the MN (2001:db8::2:20d:93ff:fe55:8f79) is now found in
	  the inserted Home Address Option. The ESP Extension Header
	  has not been modified in the process. It should be noted
	  that the payload length field of the IPv6 header has been
	  recomputed by Scapy: its value differs from the one in the
	  initial packet due to the addition of the Destination
	  Option Header.  
</p>
<p> Having implemented the mangling of the BU, the attacker
	  expects the HA to reply (if the BU is accepted) with a
	  BA. This BA, sent to the address of the attacker, will
	  include a Type 2 Routing Header (RH2). Unlike previous
	  mangling which required the insertion of an extension header
	  in the packet (the Destination Option Header), the attacker
	  now needs to remove the RH2 from the BA and set the MN's
	  HoA as destination address in the IPv6 header before sending
	  it to the peer. 
</p>
<p> Improving the PoC to do that can be done in the
	  following way: 
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
    ...

    ipv6 = pkt[IPv6]     # access IPv6 layer from received packet
    rh2  = pkt.payload   # RH2 follows IPv6
    esp  = rh2.payload   # ESP follows RH2
    ipv6.payload = None  # Remove what follows IPv6 header
    del(lower.plen)      # Delete length to have it recomputed

    ipv6.dst=rh2.addresses[0] # Set HoA from RH2 as IPv6 dst address
    ipv6.nh = 50         # Update IPv6 next header field value

    p = ipv6 / esp

    ...
</pre></div>
<p>For clarity, the ESP-protected BA received by the
	  attacker as a response from the HA has the following
	  layout:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

Results</h3>

<p> Implementing a PoC to test the effects of all theoretical
	attacks against UMIP was easily done by developing a small
	Automaton under	Scapy (few lines of Python code). 
</p>
<p> With such a tool, an attacker simply advertising the Home
	Subnet prefix of a MN is able to make it believe it is at
	home. Depending on the configuration of the MN, this may
	allow the attacker to directly target the
	MN:<br />
<br />
 

	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> If OptimisticHandoff configuration option is disabled 
	      (the default) this result in a simple DoS, the MN
	      waiting for a BA before it is able to communicate. 
</li>
<li> If OptimisticHandoff configuration option is enabled,
	    the MN can then be joined on its HoA but cannot sent
	    traffic from that address (i.e. reply for instance) until
	    the reception of the BA.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p> When the attacker also activates the relaying of BU from
	the MN to the HA and the relaying of the associated BA from
	the HA to the MN, the attack gets effective: the MN is fully
	deregistered and does no more use IPsec protection for data
	traffic, believing it is on its home network.
</p>
<p> The attack works against UMIP implementation because
	  the values found in the source address of the IPv6 packet,
	  the Home Address Option and the AltCoA are not invalid from
	  a specification standpoint, for a de-registration BU. 
</p>
<p> Another reason is that the addition (respectively removal)
	of the Destination Option Header (respectively RH2) in the
	the BU (respectively BA) does not interfere with the
	protection provided by ESP on the signaling traffic.

UMIP improvements</h3>

<p>In this subsection, we discuss the additional checks that
	  UMIP should implement in order to prevent previous
	  attacks. Note that those checks should only be seen as
	  workarounds/improvements of current situation, but not as a
	  complete solution to the Home Link Detection mechanism. 
</p>
<p> UMIP should not enforce an optimistic behavior when
      	    coming back home, i.e. it should not drop its IPsec tunnel
      	    protection before the BA is received from the HA. This
      	    does not make much sense from a performance point of view
      	    and has security impacts, leading to the ability for an
      	    attacker to have the MN handle incoming traffic (even
      	    though the MN is unable to reply until it receives the
      	    protected BA from the HA).
</p>
<p> UMIP should be modified in order for the HA to perform
	    stricter checks on incoming BU and only allow the
	    following layouts for de-registration
	    BU:<br />
<br />
  
	    
	    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Case 1 (Home De-registration): Lifetime is set to 0,
	      the packet does not contain an AltCoA option, does not
	      contain a Destination Option Header carrying a HAO and
	      has HoA as IPv6 source address. 
</li>
<li> Case 2 (Remote De-registration): Lifetime is set to
	      0, the packet IPv6 source address is current registered
	      CoA, the packet contains a Destination Option Header
	      carrying a HAO (which contains the HoA), the packet
	      contains an AltCoA option carrying current registered
	      CoA (i.e. matching IPv6 source address of the
	      packet).
</li>
</ul><p>
	  
</p>
<p> Not that those proposed checks are stricter than the one
	  expected from a RFC3775-compliant implementation which may
	  result in interoperability issues. Ironically enough, if
	  such strict layouts had been initially specified in the
	  reference documents, this would have helped, both from
	  interoperability and security standpoints.
</p>
<p> As detailed in the appendix, the rules for MN and HA
	    for the creation and processing of BU are more than 
	    fuzzy in reference documents. Those are spread over at
	    least 4 sections of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>: 
	    6.1.7, 9.5.1, 10.3.2, 11.7.1. Rules for the sender (MN)
	    and the receiver (HA) do not match on some aspects, for
	    no specific reasons.

</p>
<p> For instance, the allowed format of de-registration BU

Use of SEND in Home Link Detection mechanism</h3>

<p> The first idea that comes to mind is to try and work on the root
	  of the issues, the Home Link Detection mechanism. By removing an
	  attacker the ability to spoof RA on a foreign network with crafted
	  ones including PIO with Home Subnet Prefix, the issue could
	  possibly be prevented. 
</p>
<p> For that purpose, from a theoretical standpoint, SEND could
	  directly be used, simply by creating a Secure Home Link Detection
	  mechanism in which it would be required that RA advertising the
	  Home Subnet Prefix be signed. That way, an attacker on a
	  foreign link would not be able to trigger a deregistration
	  and this would prevent the IPsec tunnel protection to be
	  dropped.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that this possible solution comes with the
	  following drawbacks:<br />
<br />

	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It requires SEND to be implement on the Home Network.
</li>
<li>It requires SEND to be supported by the MIPv6 module.
</li>
<li>It does not protect the MNs on a foreign link against an
	      attacker that has simultaneous access to both the MN's Home
	      Subnet and the MN's foreign subnet. Even if this is a
	      strong hypothesis.

	  HA. <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F.

	  even if they expect the IPsec tunnel to be torn down when

</p>
<p> It is possible to solve the issue by having MN warning
	  their HA that they are not willing to drop their IPsec
	  tunnel when back home. This simple solution (indicating that
	  willingness to keep IPsec tunnel protection up and running
	  on the home subnet is just a matter of a single flag in a
	  BU) would provide an efficient workaround to the issue.
</p>
<p> It would also be possible not to advertise anything in the
	  BU (not consume a flag) and let that as a local
	  configuration issue between the MN and the HA (requiring
	  configuration to be in sync on both sides).
</p>
<p> One would argue that this solution (maintaining IPsec
	  tunneling on the Home Network) could have negative drawbacks

<a name="rfc.section.A.1"></a><h3>A.1.&nbsp;
Mobile IPv6 Home Link detection mechanism</h3>

<p> The Mobile IPv6 Home Link detection mechanism is quite
	  simple. In fact, it is specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> by a simple
	  sentence, in section 11.5.4 (``Returning Home''):
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
A mobile node detects that it has returned to its home link through
the movement detection algorithm in use (Section 11.5.1), when the
mobile node detects that its home subnet prefix is again
on-link.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> At the time of writing, MIPv6 specification is being revised
	  and that part of the document has been enhanced, to support
	  interactions with IKEv2 for Home Prefix Assignment
	  <a class='info' href='#RFC5026'>[RFC5026]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Giaretta, G., Kempf, J., and V. Devarapalli, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in Split Scenario,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Current version (02) of the draft
	  <a class='info' href='#draft-ietf-mext-rfc3775bis'>[draft&#8209;ietf&#8209;mext&#8209;rfc3775bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> now includes a new specific
	  subsection providing a simple detection algorithm (based
	  on <a class='info' href='#draft-krishnan-mext-hld'>[draft&#8209;krishnan&#8209;mext&#8209;hld]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Krishnan, S. and G. Tsirtsis, &ldquo;MIPv6 Home Link Detection,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) . The relevant part of the
	  algorithm is provided below:
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
...

o  Given the availability of the home prefix, the MN checks whether
   or not the home prefix matches one of the prefixes received in the
   RA.  If it does, the MN concludes that it has returned home.

...
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> It basically goes in the same direction as <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>:
	  Mobile Node considers itself on its home link if it detects a
	  match between an advertised prefix and its home subnet prefix.
	
</p>
<p> In the end, the expected Home Link detection mechanism has not
	  been modified compared to the one specified in the original
	  MIPv6 specification: simply put, if the MN finds itself on
	  a link where its Home Subnet Prefix is advertised, it considers
	  itself at home.

Emission of deregistration BU by the MN</h3>

<p>This excerpt from section 11.5.4 (``Returning Home'') of

	  modified, but now has number 11.5.5) describes the emission of the
	  deregistration BU to the HA, just after it has detected it is at
	  home (using previous mechanism):
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
...

The mobile node SHOULD then send a Binding Update to its
home agent, to instruct its home agent to no longer intercept or
tunnel packets for it. In this home registration, the mobile node
MUST set the Acknowledge (A) and Home Registration (H) bits, set
the Lifetime field to zero, and set the care-of address for the
binding to the mobile node's own home address.  The mobile node
MUST use its home address as the source address in the Binding
Update.

...
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> As for all Binding Update messages sent to the Home Agent as
	  part of Home Registration, IPsec protection is
	  expected. Usually, in order for the CoA information to be IPsec
	  protected (ESP does not provide protection for packet
	  source address), the Alternate CoA Option must be present in the
	  BU. This is explicitly stated in Section 11.7.1 (``Sending
	  Binding Updates to the Home Agent'')  of <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>:
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
...

o  The care-of address for the binding MUST be used as the Source
   Address in the packet's IPv6 header, unless an Alternate Care-of
   Address mobility option is included in the Binding Update.  This
   option MUST be included in all home registrations, as the ESP
   protocol will not be able to protect care-of addresses in the IPv6
   header.  (Mobile IPv6 implementations that know they are using
   IPsec AH to protect a particular message might avoid this option.
   For brevity the usage of AH is not discussed in this document.)

...
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, this expected behavior is somewhat different when
	  the Mobile Node is at home and needs to send its Binding
	  Update. This is described at the end of the following excerpt
	  from Section 4.3 (``IPsec Protocol Processing'') of
	  <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>:
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
o  When ESP is used to protect Binding Updates, there is no
   protection for the care-of address which appears in the IPv6
   header outside the area protected by ESP.  It is important for the
   home agent to verify that the care-of address has not been
   tampered with.  As a result, the attacker would have redirected
   the mobile node's traffic to another address.  In order to prevent
   this, Mobile IPv6 implementations MUST use the Alternate Care-of
   Address mobility option in Binding Updates sent by mobile nodes
   while away from home.  The exception to this is when the mobile
   node returns home and sends a Binding Update to the home agent in
   order to de-register.  In this case no Alternate Care-of Address
   option is needed, as described in Section 3.1.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>More specifically, as described in section 11.5.4 of
	  <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, the HoA must be set as source address of the
	  Binding Update message:
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
...

In this home registration, the mobile node MUST set [...] the
care-of address for the binding to the mobile node's own home
address.  The mobile node MUST use its home address as the source
address in the Binding Update.

...
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>Still in <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> (Section 3.1,``Binding Updates and
	  Acknowledgements''),  specific examples of expected packet
	  layouts are given for registration when the node comes back
	  home:
	  
	  
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
 When the mobile node is at home, the above rules are different as
 the mobile node can use its home address as a source address.  This
 typically happens for the de-registration Binding Update when the
 mobile is returning home.  In this situation, the Binding Updates
 MUST support at least the following headers in the following order:
</pre></div><p>

	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      IPv6 header (source = home address,
                   destination = home agent)
      ESP header in transport mode
      Mobility header
         Binding Update
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>This layout is associated with ``MUST support'' statements and is
	  expected to be used. Note that <a class='info' href='#RFC4877'>[RFC4877]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V. and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised 	    IPsec Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, the revised version

	  behavior.
	
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that MIPv6 specification splits the
	  emission and validation steps: previous discussion were
	  associated with the emission of the deregistration BU by the
	  MN. Processing rules for validation and parsing of BU by the HA
	  when receiving it are covered in different sections of the

Receipt and validation of deregistration BU by
		      the HA</h3>

<p>The reference documents require that Home Agent supports
	  previous Layout for deregistration Binding
	  Update. Even if this is probably the expected layout, this is
	  not the only possible solution. Additional information are
	  given in Section 9.5.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, for validating
	  Binding Update messages in general.
</p>
<p>Section 10.3.2 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> covers in details ``Primary
	  Care-of Address De-Registration''. Here, the validation of
	  deregistration BU format by the HA leaves room for
	  different layouts: 
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
A binding may need to be de-registered when the mobile node returns
home or when the mobile node knows that it will not have any
  care-of addresses in the visited network.

A Binding Update is validated and authorized in the manner described
in the previous section; note that when the mobile node de-registers
when it is at home, it may not include the Home Address destination
option, in which case the mobile node's home address is the source IP
address of the de-registration Binding Update.  This section
describes the processing of a valid Binding Update that requests the
receiving node to no longer serve as its home agent, de-registering
its primary care-of address.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> The non-normative ``may not include the Home Address
	  destination option'' is ambiguous and error-prone: section
	  11.5.4 has a ``MUST use its home address as the source address
	  in the Binding Update''. If the Home Agent allows
	  deregistration BUs with Home Address destination option, this
	  leaves room for those to be sent from a foreign network,
	  probably to support the case where ``the mobile node knows
	  that it will not have any care-of addresses in the visited
	  network''.
	
</p>
<p> Because of the rules for determining care-of address and
	  home address, provided in section 9.5.1
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
The specified care-of address MUST be determined as follows:

o  If the Alternate Care-of Address option is present, the care-of
   address is the address in that option.

o  Otherwise, the care-of address is the Source Address field in the
   packet's IPv6 header.
</pre></div><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
The home address for the binding MUST be determined as follows:

o  If the Home Address destination option is present, the home
   address is the address in that option.

o  Otherwise, the home address is the Source Address field in the
   packet's IPv6 header.
</pre></div>
<p>The following various deregistration BU sent by a Mobile Node
	  should probably be considered valid (even if the specific
	  layout may not be supported on a specific implementation):
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      IPv6 header (source = some address (possibly the HoA),
                   destination = home agent)
      ESP header in transport mode
      Mobility header
         Binding Update
            Alternate Care-of Address option (Home Address)
</pre></div><p>

	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      IPv6 header (source = Home Address,
                   destination = home agent)
      Destination Options header
         Home Address option (home address)
      ESP header in transport mode
      Mobility header
         Binding Update
</pre></div><p>

	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      IPv6 header (source = some address (possibly the HoA),
                   destination = home agent)
      Destination Options header
         Home Address option (home address)
      ESP header in transport mode
      Mobility header
         Binding Update
            Alternate Care-of Address option (Home Address)
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>The last example is the common layout expected by the HA when
	  the MN is on a foreign network.
</p>
<p>The point here is that the expected layout for deregistration
	  BU sent by the MN should be strictly checked by the HA when
	  receiving the BU. It seems that the receiving rules for the HA
	  are not that strict, possibly to support the case where
	  ``mobile node knows that it will not have any care-of
	  addresses in the visited network''.

Local impacts of BU processing on the HA and emission of BA</h3>

<p>In this subsection, we just make the hypothesis that the HA has 
	  received a deregistration BU which it has considered valid and
	  that it has determined the care-of address and the home-address
	  as described in section 9.5.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, quoted in
	  previous subsection.
	
</p>
<p> The expected behavior by the HA is to remove the binding
	  (local modification of MIPv6 related structures). It is also
	  expected (even if not mandatory) that the tunnel with the Mobile
	  Node be removed, now that it is back home. This is described at
	  the end of section 11.5.4 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>:
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
Note that the tunnel via the home agent typically stops operating at
the same time that the home registration is deleted.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> When IPsec is used for protecting tunneled traffic, the same
	  behavior is expected. Section 4.2 of <a class='info' href='#RFC4877'>[RFC4877]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V. and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised 	    IPsec Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies
	  that:
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
o  When the mobile node returns home and de-registers with the Home
   Agent, the tunnel between the home agent and the mobile node's
   care-of address is torn down.  The security policy entries, which
   were used for protecting tunneled traffic between the mobile node
   and the home agent, SHOULD be made inactive (for instance, by
   removing them and installing them back later through an API).  The
   corresponding security associations could be kept as they are or
   deleted depending on how they were created.  If the security
   associations were created dynamically using IKE, they are
   automatically deleted when they expire.  If the security
   associations were created through manual configuration, they MUST
   be retained and used later when the mobile node moves away from
   home again.  The security associations protecting Binding Updates,
   Binding Acknowledgements and Mobile Prefix Discovery messages
   SHOULD NOT be deleted as they do not depend on care-of addresses
   and can be used again.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>This SHOULD in <a class='info' href='#RFC4877'>[RFC4877]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V. and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised 	    IPsec Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> was a MUST in <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. The
	  protection of BU/BA traffic using ESP in transport mode is
	  unmodified by the deregistration. 
</p>
<p> After those changes, the HA sends back a BA to the MN. This is
	  required because the A bit is set in the BU sent by the MN for
	  de-registration, a BA is always sent by the HA, as described in
	  section 9.5.4 of <a class='info' href='#draft-ietf-mext-rfc3775bis'>[draft&#8209;ietf&#8209;mext&#8209;rfc3775bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>: 
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
o  If the Binding Update was discarded as described in Section 9.2
   or Section 9.5.1, a Binding Acknowledgement MUST NOT be sent.
   Otherwise the treatment depends on the following rules.

o  If the Acknowledge (A) bit set is set in the Binding Update, a
   Binding Acknowledgement MUST be sent.  Otherwise, the treatment
   depends on the below rule.

o  If the node rejects the Binding Update due to an expired nonce
   index, sequence number being out of window (Section 9.5.1), or
   insufficiency of resources (Section 9.5.2), a Binding
   Acknowledgement MUST be sent.  If the node accepts the Binding
   Update, the Binding Acknowledgement SHOULD NOT be sent.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p> This means that following the emission of a deregistration BU,
	  a MN should expect to receive a BA.
</p>
<p> With regard to the address the BA is sent, section 9.5.4 of
	  <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> contains the following: 
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
If the Source Address field of the IPv6 header that carried the
Binding Update does not contain a unicast address, the Binding
Acknowledgement MUST NOT be sent and the Binding Update packet MUST
be silently discarded.  Otherwise, the acknowledgement MUST be sent
to the Source Address.  Unlike the treatment of regular packets, this
addressing procedure does not use information from the Binding Cache.

However, a routing header is needed in some cases.  If the Source
Address is the home address of the mobile node, i.e., the Binding
Update did not contain a Home Address destination option, then the
Binding Acknowledgement MUST be sent to that address and the routing
header MUST NOT be used.  Otherwise, the Binding Acknowledgement MUST
be sent using a type 2 routing header which contains the mobile
node's home address.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>This basically implies that a deregistration BU with a HAO will
	  possibly trigger a BA with a RH2 sent to whatever address was in
	  the IPv6 header source address field in the BU. Simply put, the
	  BA is expect to be sent to the real address from which the BU
	  was sent.
</p>
<p>In section 3.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	    Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, the common cases for the
	  deregistration BA sent from the home network is covered: 
	  
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
The Binding Acknowledgement messages sent to the home address MUST
support at least the following headers in the following order:
</pre></div><p>

	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

<a name="rfc.section.A.5"></a><h3>A.5.&nbsp;
Local impact associated with BU emission and BA processing on the MN</h3>

<p> Once it has sent the deregistration BU, the MN is expected to
	  perform some modification of its ND behavior, as discussed in
	  section 11.5.5 (``Returning home'') of
	  <a class='info' href='#draft-ietf-mext-rfc3775bis'>[draft&#8209;ietf&#8209;mext&#8209;rfc3775bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Some final changes are
	  performed after receiving the BA from the HA: 
	  
	  </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
After the Mobile Node sends the Binding Update, it MUST be prepared
to reply to Neighbor Solicitations for its home address.  Such
replies MUST be sent using a unicast Neighbor Advertisement to the
sender's link-layer address.  It is necessary to reply, since sending
the Binding Acknowledgement from the home agent may require
performing Neighbor Discovery, and the mobile node may not be able to
distinguish Neighbor Solicitations coming from the home agent from
other Neighbor Solicitations.  Note that a race condition exists
where both the mobile node and the home agent respond to the same
solicitations sent by other nodes; this will be only temporary,
however, until the Binding Update is accepted.

After receiving the Binding Acknowledgement for its Binding Update to
its home agent, the mobile node MUST multicast onto the home link (to
the all-nodes multicast address) a Neighbor Advertisement [20], to
advertise the mobile node's own link-layer address for its own home
address.
</pre></div><p>

	
</p>
<p>The specification focuses on link layer interactions but does
	  not provide information on the timing associated with the
	  removal of the tunnel and/or IPsec Security Policies for
	  tunnel traffic. For performance reasons it usually happens
	  when the BU is sent (UMIP, the linux implementation,
	  does just that) to avoid sending packets with a possibly
	  invalid source address (the old CoA) while waiting for the BA
	  to come back.
	
</p>
<p> If the same timing is kept when returning home, the MN will
	  drop its IPsec protection as soon as it has sent the
	  deregistration Binding Update.
