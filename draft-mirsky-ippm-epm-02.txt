       Error Performance Measurement in Packet-switched Networks
                        draft-mirsky-ippm-epm-02

Abstract

   This document describes the use of the error performance metric to
   characterize a packet-switched network's conformance to the pre-
   defined set of performance objectives.  In this document, metrics
   that characterize error performance in a packet-switched network
   (PSN) are defined, as well as methods to measure and calculate them.
   Also, the requirements for an active Operation, Administration, and
   Maintenance protocol to support the error performance measurement in
   PSN are discussed, and potential candidate protocols are analyzed.
   All metrics and measurement methods are equally applicable to
   underlay and overlay networks.

1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a collection of
   methods to detect, characterize, localize failures in a network, and
   monitor the network's performance using various measurement methods.
   Traditionally, the former set of OAM tools identified as Fault
   Management (FM) OAM.  The latter - Performance Monitoring (PM) OAM.
   Some OAM protocols can be used for both groups of tasks, while some
   serve one particular group.  But regardless of how many OAM protocols
   are in use, network operators and network users are faced with
   multiple metrics that characterize the network conditions.  This
   document describes a new component of packet-switched network (PSN)
   OAM.

   Error performance measurement (EPM) is a part of an OAM toolset that
   provides an operator with information related to network measurements
   for a uni-directional or a bidirectional connection between two
   systems.  In current technology, EPM has been defined only for data
   communication methods that have a constant bit-rate transmission
   [ITU.G.826] and not for PSN, where transmissions are statistically
   random.  As a statistically multiplexed network in a PSN, a receiver
   node does not expect a packet to arrive from a sender node at a
   specific moment, less from a particular sender.  That is what

   differentiates PSN from networks built on a constant bit-rate
   transmission, where a stream of bits between two nodes is always
   present, whether it represents data or not.  That provides the
   receiver with a predictable number of measurements in a series of
   measurement intervals.  In PSN, on-path OAM methods, i.e.,
   measurement methods that use data flow, cannot provide such
   predictability and thus be used for EPM.  In PSN, EPM needs to use
   active OAM methods, per definition in [RFC7799].  This document
   identifies metrics that characterize PSN error performance and
   methods to measure and calculate them.  Also, the requirements for an
   active OAM protocol to support EPM in PSN are discussed, and
   potential candidate protocols are analyzed.

3.  Error Performance Metrics

   When analyzing the error performance of a path between two nodes, we
   need to select a time interval as the unit of EPM.  In [ITU.G.826], a
   time interval of one second is used.  It is reasonable to use the
   same time interval for EPM for PSNs.  Further, for the purpose of
   EPM, each time interval, i.e., second, is classified either as
   Errored Second (ES), Severely Errored Second (SES), or Error-Free
   Second (EFS).  These are defined as follows:

   o  An ES is a time interval during which at least one of the
      performance parameters degraded below its optimal level threshold
      or a defect was detected.

   o  An SES is a time interval during which at least one the
      performance parameters degraded below its critical threshold or a
      defect was detected.

   o  Consequently, an EFS is a time interval during which all
      performance objectives are at or above their respective optimal
      levels, and no defect has been detected.

   The definition of a state of a defect in the network is also
   necessary for understanding the EPM.  In this document, the defect is
   interpreted as the state of inability to communicate between a
   particular set of nodes.  It is important to note that it is being
   defined as a state, and thus, it has conditions that define entry
   into it and exit out of it.  Also, the state of defect exists only in
   connection to the particular group of nodes in the network, not the
   network as a domain.

3.1.  Measure Error Performance Metrics

   The definitions of ES, SES, and EFS allow for characterization of the
   communication between two nodes relative to the level of required and
   acceptable performance and when performance degrades below the
   acceptable level.  The former condition in this document referred to
   as network availability.  The latter - network unavailability.  Based
   on the definitions, SES is the one-second of network unavailability
   while ES and EFS present an interval of network availability.  But
   since the conditions of network are everchanging periods of network
   availability and unavailability need to be defined with duration
   larger than one-second interval to reduce the number of state changes
   while correctly reflecting the network condition.  The method to
   determine the state of the network in terms of EPM OAM is described
   below:





Mirsky & Min             Expires August 26, 2021                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Error Performance Measurement        February 2021


   o  If ten consecutive SES intervals been detected, then the EPM state
      of the network determined as unavailability and the beginning of
      that period of unavailability state is at the start of the first
      SES in the sequence of the consecutive SES intervals.

   o  Similarly, ten consecutive non-SES intervals, i.e., either ES or
      EFS, indicate that the network is in the availability period,
      i.e., available.  The start of that period is at the beginning of
      the first non-SES interval.

   o  Resulting from these two definitions, a sequence of less than ten
      consecutive SES or non-SES intervals does not change the EPM state
      of the network.  For example, if the EPM state is determined as
      unavailability, a sequence of seven EFS intervals is not viewed as
      an availability period.

3.2.  Calculate Error Performance Metrics

   Determining the period in which the path is currently EP-wise is
   helpful.  But because switching between periods requires ten
   consecutive one-second intervals, conditions that last shorter
   intervals may not be adequately reflected.  Two additional EP OAM
   metrics can be used, and they are defined as follows:

   o  errored second ratio (ESR) is the ratio of ES to the total number
      of seconds in a time of the availability periods during a fixed
      measurement interval.

   o  severely errored second ratio (SESR) - is the ratio of SES to the
      total number of seconds in a time of the availability periods
      during a fixed measurement interval.

5.  Active OAM Protocol for EPM

   Digital communication methods characterized as the constant-bit rate
   digital paths and connections allow measurement of the error
   performance without using an active OAM.  That is possible because a
   predictable flow of digital signals is expected at an egress system.
   That is not the case for packet-switched networks that are based on
   the principle of statistical multiplexing flows.  The latter usually
   improves the utilization of the communication network's resources,
   but it also makes the flow unpredictable for the egress system.  For
   that reason, an active OAM has to be used in measuring the error
   performance in a network.  A combination of OAM protocols can provide

   the necessary for EPM functionality.  For example, Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] can be used to monitor the
   continuity of a path between the ingress and egress systems.  And
   STAMP [RFC8762] can be used to measure and calculate performance
   metrics that are used as Service Level Objectives.  But using two
   protocols and correlating the state of the network from them adds to
   the complexity in network operation.

   The Integrated OAM, described in [I-D.mmm-rtgwg-integrated-oam],
   combines lightweight FM OAM with the comprehensive set of performance
   measurement methods.  PM component of the Integrated OAM is based on
   [RFC6374] that supports, among other measurement methods, one-way and
   two-way packet loss and packet delay measurements.
