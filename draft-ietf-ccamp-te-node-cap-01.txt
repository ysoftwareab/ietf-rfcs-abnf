Abstract 
    
   It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) node capabilities during TE LSP path selection, such 
   as for instance the capability to act as a branch LSR of a P2MP LSP. 
   This requires advertising these capabilities within the IGP. 
   For that purpose, this document specifies OSPF and IS-IS traffic 
   engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane and 
   data plane traffic engineering node capabilities.

1. Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC3031], [RFC3209] and 
   [RFC4461]. 
 
 
2. Introduction 
    
   MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) routing ([IS-IS-TE], [OSPF-TE]) 
   relies on extensions to link state IGP routing protocols ([OSPF-v2], 
   [IS-IS]) in order to advertise Traffic Engineering (TE) link 
   information used for constraint based routing. Further Generalized 
   MPLS (GMPLS) related routing extensions are defined in [IS-IS-G] and 
   [OSPF-G].  
    
   It is desired to complement these routing extensions in order to 
   advertise TE node capabilities, in addition to TE link information. 
   These TE node capabilities will be taken into account as constraints 
   during path selection. 
    
   Indeed, it is useful to advertise data plane TE node capabilities, 
   such as, for instance the capability for an LSR to be a branch LSR or 
   a bud-LSR of a P2MP LSP. These capabilities can then be taken into 
   account as constraints when computing TE LSP paths. 
    
   It is also useful to advertise control plane TE node capabilities 
   such as for instance the capability to support GMPLS signaling for a 
   packet LSR, or the capability to support P2MP (Point to Multipoint) 
   TE LSP signaling.  This allows selecting a path that avoids nodes 
   that do not support a given signaling feature, or triggering a 
   mechanism to support such nodes. Hence this facilitates backward 
   compatibility. 
    
   For that purpose, this document specifies IGP (OSPF and IS-IS) 
   traffic engineering node capability TLVs in order to advertise data 
   plane and control plane capabilities of a node. 
    
   A new TLV is defined for ISIS and OSPF: the TE Node Capability 
   Descriptor TLV, to be carried within: 
        - The ISIS Capability TLV ([ISIS-CAP]) for ISIS 
        - The Router Information LSA ([OSPF-CAP]) for OSPF.

3. TE Node Capability Descriptor  
 
3.1. Description 
 
   LSRs in a network may have distinct control plane and data plane  
   Traffic Engineering capabilities. The TE Node Capability Descriptor  
   information defined in this document describes data and control plane 
   capabilities of an LSR. Such information can be used for instance 
   during path computation so as to avoid nodes that do not support a 
   given TE feature either in the control or data plane or to trigger 
   procedure to handle these nodes along the path (e.g trigger LSP 
   hierarchy to support a legacy transit LSR on a P2MP LSP (see [RSVP-
   P2MP]). In some cases, this may also be useful to ensure backward 
   compatibility.   
 
3.2. Required Information 
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor contains two variable length sets 
   of bit flags: 
        - The Data Plane Capabilities: This a variable length  
   set of bit flags where each bit corresponds to a given TE data plane 
   capability.  
        - The Control Plane Capabilities: This a variable length  
   set of bit flags where each bit corresponds to a given TE control 
   plane capability.  
              
   Two Data Plane Capabilities are currently defined: 
            - B bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act  
              as a branch node on a P2MP LSP (see [P2MP-REQ]);  
            - E bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act  
              as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an LSR that is both  
              transit and egress (see [P2MP-REQ]).  
              
   Three Control Plane Capabilities are currently defined:   
            - M bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports  
              MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-TE]);        
            - G bit: when set this flag indicates that the LSR supports  
              GMPLS signaling ([RSVP-G]); 
            - P bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports  
              P2MP MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).  
              
   Note that new capability bits may be added in the future if required. 
   Also more complex capabilities encoded within sub-TLVs may be added 
   in the future if required.

4. TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV formats  
    
4.1. OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV format  
    
   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is made of various non-
   ordered sub-TLVs.  
    
   The format of the OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV and its sub-
   TLVs is the same as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering 
   Extensions to OSPF [OSPF-TE]. That is, the TLV is composed of 2 
   octets for the type, 2 octets specifying the TLV length and a value 
   field.  The TLV is padded to four-octet alignment; padding is not 
   included in the length field (so a three octet value would have a 
   length of three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight 
   octets).  Sub-TLVs are also 32-bit aligned.  Unrecognized types are 
   ignored.  All types between 32768 and 65535 are reserved for vendor-
   specific extensions.  All other undefined type codes are reserved for 
   future assignment by IANA.  
    
   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:  
          
         TYPE     To be defined by IANA 
         LENGHT   Variable 
         VALUE    This comprises one or more sub-TLVs  
    
   Currently two sub-TLVs are defined:                   
            Sub-TLV type  Length               Name   
                1      variable     DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV   
                2      variable     CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
                       
   Any unrecognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.   
    
   More sub-TLVs could be added in the future to handle new 
   capabilities. 
 
   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried within an OSPF 
   Router Information LSA which is defined in [OSPF-CAP]. 
 
    
4.1.1. The DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
           
   The DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV is a series of bit flags, where each bit 
   correspond to a data plane TE node capability, and has a variable  
   length.   
        
   The format of the DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV is as follows: 
    
         TYPE     To be assigned by IANA (suggested value =1) 
         LENGTH   It is set to N x 4 octets.  N starts

                  from 1 and can be increased when there is a need.    
                  Each 4 octets are referred to as a capability flag. 
         VALUE    This comprises one or more capability flags.   
                  For each 4 octets, the bits are indexed from the most  
                  significant to the least significant, where each bit  
                  represents one data plane TE node capability.  When   
                  the first 32 capabilities are defined, a new   
                  capability flag will be used to accommodate the next  
                  capability. These bits are under IANA control. 
 
   The following bits are defined the first capability flag: 
    
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |B|E|                     Reserved                              | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
 
     Bit       Capabilities 
 
      0      B bit: P2MP Branch Node capability: When set this indicates  
             that the LSR can act as a branch node on a P2MP LSP     
             [P2MP-REQ];  
      1      E bit: P2MP Bud-LSR capability: When set, this indicates  
             that the LSR can act as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an  
             LSR that is both transit and egress [P2MP-REQ]; 
    
   The values for the B and E bits are to be assigned by IANA. 
    
     2-31    Reserved for future assignments by IANA. 
         
 
4.1.2. The CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
           
   The CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV is a series of bit flags, where each 
   bit correspond to a control plane TE node capability, and has a 
   variable length.   
        
   The format of the CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV is as follows: 
 
 
         TYPE     To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 2) 
         LENGHT   It is set to N x 4 octets.  N starts 
                  from 1 and can be increased when there is a need.    
                  Each 4 octets are referred to as a capability flag. 
         VALUE    This comprises one or more capability flags.   
                  For each 4 octets, the bits are indexed from the most   
                  significant to the least significant, where each bit  
                  represents one control plane TE node capability.  When  
                  the first 32 capabilities are defined, a new   
                  capability flag will be used to accommodate the next  
                  capability. These bits are under IANA control.

4.2. IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV format 
 
   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is made of various non 
   ordered sub-TLVs.  
    
   The format of the IS-IS TE Node Capability TLV and its sub-TLVs is 
   the same as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions 
   to IS-IS [IS-IS-TE]. That is, the TLV is composed of 1 octet for the   
   type, 1 octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.   
    
   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:

   Any unrecognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored. More sub-TLVs 
   could be added in the future to handle new capabilities.

      LENGTH: It is set to N. N starts from 1 and can be increased   
              when there is a need. Each octet is referred to as a  
              capability flag. 
      VALUE: This comprises one or more control plane TE node capability    
             flags.

   The following bits defined in the first capability flag: 
    
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |M|G|P|Reserved |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
       
    -M bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports MPLS-TE  
            signaling ([RSVP-TE]).  
             
    -G bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports GMPLS signaling    
            ([RSVP-G]).  
           
    -P bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports P2MP MPLS-TE   
            signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).  
    
     Reserved bits are for future assignment by IANA. 
    
   The values for the M, G and P bits are to be assigned by IANA. 
    
 
5. Elements of procedure 
 
5.1. OSPF 
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is advertised, within an OSPFv2 
   Router Information LSA (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0) 
   or OSPFv3 Router information LSA (function code of 12) which are 
   defined in [OSPF-CAP].  As such, elements of procedure are inherited 
   from those defined in [OSPF-CAP]. 
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV advertises capabilities that  
   may be taken into account as constraints during path selection. Hence  
   its flooding scope is area-local, and it MUST be carried within 
   OSPFv2 type 10 Router Information LSA (as defined in [RFC2370]) or an 
   OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit 
   cleared (as defined in [OSPFv3]). 
 
   A router MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever  
   the content of any of the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV changes 
   or whenever required by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA refresh 
   (every LSRefreshTime)).  
 
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is OPTIONAL and must at most 
   appear once in an OSPF Router Information LSA or ISIS Router 
   Capability TLV. 
    
   When an OSPF LSA or ISIS LSP does not contain any TE Node capability  
   Descriptor TLV, this means that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are  
   unknown.   
 
Vasseur, Le Roux, et al.                                      [Page 9] 
  
Internet Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-01.txt        June 2006 


    
   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger CSPF    
   computation, but MUST not trigger normal SPF computation. 
    
   Note also that TE node capabilities are expected to be fairly static. 
 
5.2. IS-IS 
 
   The TE Node Capability TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV 
   defined in [IS-IS-CAP]. As such, elements of procedure are inherited 
   from those defined in [IS-IS-CAP]. 
 
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV advertises capabilities that 
   may be taken into account as constraints during path selection. Hence 
   its flooding is area-local, and MUST be carried within an IS-IS 
   CAPABILITY TLV having the S flag cleared.  
 
   An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content  
   of any of the TE Node Capability TLV changes or whenever required by 
   the regular IS-IS procedure (LSP refresh).  
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is OPTIONAL and must at most 
   appear once in an OSPF Router Information LSA or ISIS Router 
   Capability TLV. 
    
   When a IS-IS LSP does not contain any TE Node capability Descriptor 
   TLV, this means that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.  
    
   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger CSPF    
   computation, but MUST not trigger normal SPF computation. 
 
   Note also that TE node capabilities are expected to be fairly static. 
                  
6. Backward compatibility 
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs defined in this document do 
   not introduce any interoperability issue. For OSPF, a router not 
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV MUST just silently 
   ignore the TLV as specified in [OSPF-CAP]. For IS-IS a router not 
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV MUST just silently 
   ignore the TLV as specified in [IS-IS-CAP]. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
 
   No new security issues are raised in this document. 
    
8. IANA considerations  
 
8.1. OSPF TLVs 
 
   IANA is in charge of the assignment of TLV code points for the Router 
   Information LSA defined in [OSPF-CAP]. 
 
Vasseur, Le Roux, et al.                                     [Page 10] 
  
Internet Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-01.txt        June 2006 


   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the TE Node Capability 
   Descriptor TLV defined in this document and carried within the Router 
   Information LSA.  
    
   IANA will be in charge of the assignment of sub-TLV code points for  
   the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV defined in this document. 
   Two sub-TLVs types are defined for this TLV and should be assigned by 
   IANA: 
        -CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =1) 
        -DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =2) 
 
8.2. ISIS TLVs 
    
   IANA is in charge of the assignment of sub-TLV code points for the 
   ISIS CAPABILITY TLV defined in [ISIS-CAP]. 
   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the TE Node Capability 
   Descriptor TLV defined in this document, and carried within the ISIS 
   CAPABILITY TLV. 
    
   IANA will be in charge of the assignment of sub-TLV code points for  
   the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV defined in this document. 
   Two sub-TLVs types are defined for this TLV and should be assigned by 
   IANA: 
        -CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =1) 
        -DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =2) 
 
8.3. Capability bits 
 
   IANA is requested to manage the space of control plane and data plane 
   capability bit flags carried within the OSPF and ISIS TE Node 
   Capability Descriptor TLVs, numbering them in the usual IETF notation 
   starting at zero and continuing at least through 31. 
   New bit numbers may be allocated only by an IETF Consensus action. 
   Each bit should be tracked with the following qualities: 
      - Bit number 
      - Defining RFC 
      - Name of bit 
       
   Currently two capabilies are defined in the data plane capability 
   flags and must be assigned by IANA. Here are the suggested values: 
      -0x01: P2MP Branch LSR capability 
      -0x02: P2MP Bud LSR capability 
    
   Currently three capabilities are defined in the control plane 
   capability flags and must be assigned by IANA. Here are the suggested 
   values: 
      -0x01: MPLS-TE support 
      -0x02: GMPLS support 
      -0x04: P2MP RSVP-TE support
