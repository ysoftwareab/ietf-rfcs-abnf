    WHERE DOES IT FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK

    Fits in the MPLS, and PWE3 boxes.

    WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THESE WGs

    This draft shows that LSP-PING and Y.1711 can be considered to be
    complementary tools in the suite of options to measure and

                          Overview of Y.17iw


 1. Introduction

    Y.17iw is a draft recommendation coming from the collaboration of
    ITU-T SG13 Questions 3 and 5.

    Y.17iw is focused on fault management interworking between [Y1711]
    and [I610] in two scenarios, network interworking (overlay), and
    service interworking (peer).

    This draft is purely informational.

 2. Terminology

    The terminology used in the appendices is directly as written in
    the ITU-T draft recommendation (for consistency) and borrows from
    [Y1711] and [I610]. The relevant terms are:

    defect: Interruption of the capability of a transport entity
         (e.g. network connection) to transfer user or OAM information.

    far end termination - LSP ingress

    near end termination - LSP egress

    VCLC - virtual channel link connection

    VPLC - virtual path link connection

    Other definitions are provided with the reference models in
    sections 4 and 5.

 3. Principles

    Y.17iw treats the ATM and MPLS/PW components of the connectivity
    between CEs as separate maintenance entities. The maintenance
    entities have defect states that act as inputs into either the
    client maintenance entity (network interworking or PW scenario) or
    peer maintenance entity (service interworking or L2VPN interworking
    scenario) and trigger appropriate OAM actions (described in the
    appendices). There is no actual interworking or translation of the
    OAM protocols per se.

    Figure 1 illustrates that in the network interworking or overlay
    scenario, the PW and PSN layers assume specific position in the
    overall hierarchy. W.r.t. to the I.610 model, the PW and PSN layers
    are a direct insertion between the F3 and F4 OAM layers.

    Figure 2 illustrates the reference model for the network
    interworking scenario. The overall e2e ATM connection is uniquely
    identified (IEW-ME). The component of the ATM connections extending
    across each attachment circuit (ATM1-ME and ATM2-ME) are uniquely
    identified. The component of the ATM connection carried by the PW
    is uniquely identified (EATM-ME). Each PW LSP has a unique
    direction and is a unique maintenance entity (LSP1/2 ME).

        Figure 3: Service Interworking of a VCC or VPC and a PW/LSP

    Figure 3 illustrates that the LSP and the ATM VCC/VPC are peer
    maintenance entities. The extraction of 'native service' at the
    payload level is a distinct and separate function from the
    interworking of the maintenance entity defect states.

 6. Applicability

    The procedures for the network interworking scenario outlined in
    appendix 'A' are applicable to the PWE3 draft [ATM_ENCAP].

    The procedures for the service interworking scenario outlined in
    appendix 'B' are applicable to [SAJASSI].

 Appendix 'A': Procedures for the Network Interworking Scenario

    OAM interworking is confined to being an interaction of the near
    end defect handling state machine for the MPLS LSP and the
    transported ATM VCCs and/or VPCs.

    The MPLS LSP defect state acts as an input to the ATM layer
    management function (described in [I732]). An MPLS layer defect
    acts as a transmission path (TP) failure indicator to the ATM layer
    management function.

    Note that the possibility of dTTSI_Mismerge/dTTSI_Misbranch MPLS
    layer defects means that TP failure can occur without interruption
    of F4/F5 flows and user traffic at the ATM layer. This is addressed
    by the transition to AIS state.

    1) Upon entry of the LSP-ME near end to a defect state.
    The egress IWF will instruct the ATM layer management function of
    each IWE-ME that is a client of the unavailable LSP-ME to enter e-
    t-e-AIS-generation condition and seg-AIS-generation condition with
    corresponding suppression of user traffic transiting the EATM-ME.

    2) Upon exit of the LSP-ME near end from a defect state.
    The egress IWF will instruct the ATM layer management function to
    exit end-to-end and seg AIS generation condition and re-enable
    transit of IWE traffic across the IWF.

    3) ATM LMI
    Other ATM Layer Management Interface functions are unaffected.

    Appendix 'B': Procedures for the "Service Interworking" Scenario

    1) Transition of MPLS near end termination from defect-free to a
       defect state:

    The MPLS termination connection point upon transition from defect-
    free to a defect state as a result of an MPLS layer defect or
    serving layer defect will direct the ATM termination point to
         - Enter e-t-e_AIS_cell generation condition
         - Enter seg-AIS_cell generation condition
         - Suspend e2e CC cell generation, if enabled
         - Suspend seg-CC cell generation, if enabled

    2) Transition of MPLS near end termination from a defect state to
       the defect-free state:

    The MPLS near end termination connection point upon transition from
    a defect state to the defect-free state as a result of correction
    of an MPLS layer defect or serving layer defect will direct the ATM
    termination point to:
         - release e-t-e-AIS and seg_AIS generation condition,
         - resume e2e and seg CC cell generation (if activated)
         - and enable forwarding of user traffic.

    3) Transition of MPLS far end termination from defect-free to a
       defect state:

    The MPLS far end termination connection point upon transition from
    the defect-free to a defect state as a result of notification of an
    MPLS layer defect or serving layer defect will direct the ATM
    termination point to enter e-t-e_RDI_cell generation condition.

    4) Transition of MPLS far end termination from a defect state to
       the defect free state:

    The MPLS far end termination connection point upon transition from
    a defect state to the defect free state as a result of the absence
    of notification of an MPLS layer defect or serving layer defect
    will direct the ATM termination point to release e-t-e-RDI
    generation condition.

    5) Entrance of ATM termination into e2e-AIS-state or seg_AIS_state:

    The ATM termination upon entry into the e2e-AIS-state or
    seg_AIS_state will direct the MPLS far end termination to initiate
    FDI generation and to suspend CV generation. A new defect type is
    required and is for further study. The ATM termination MAY enter
    the e2e-RDI-generation state.

    6) Release of e2e-AIS-state and seg_AIS_state at the ATM
    termination:


    Allan                 Expires December 2003                 Page 7
    
                          Overview of Y.17iw

    The ATM termination upon release of both the e2e-AIS-state and
    seg_AIS_state will direct the MPLS far end termination to cease FDI
    generation and resume CV generation (if configured to do so).

    6) Entrance of ATM termination into e2e-RDI-state or seg_RDI_state:

    The ATM termination upon entry into either the e2e-RDI-state or
    seg_RDI_state will direct the MPLS far end termination to initiate
    BDI generation.

    7) Release of e2e-RDI-state and seg_RDI_state:

    The ATM termination upon release from both the e2e-RDI-state and
    seg_RDI_state will direct the MPLS far end termination to cease BDI
    generation.
