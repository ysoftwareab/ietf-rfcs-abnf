Abstract

   This document proposes a revised format for the IANA IPv6 address
   registries.  Rather than a formal definition of the format, it is
   described by giving examplies of the (current as of publication of
   this document) contents of the registries in the proposed format.
   The proposed format would bring the IANA IPv6 address registries into
   alignment with the current IPv6 Address Architecture specification,
   as well as aligning it to the format used for the IANA IPv4 address
   registry.

Internet-Draft             IANA IPv6 Registry              December 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a revised format for the IANA IPv6 address
   registries.  The proposed format would bring the IANA IPv6 address
   registries into alignment with the current IPv6 Address Architecture
   specification, as well as aligning it to the format used for the IANA
   IPv4 address registry.

   The current (as of publication of this document) IANA IPv6 registries
   [2][3] are based on a now-deprecated address architecture that used
   the concept of Top Level Aggregation Identifiers (TLAs) and sub-TLAs.
   The current IPv6 Address Architecture [1] uses the terminology of
   Global Identifiers instead of TLAs and sub-TLAs.

2.  IPv6 Address Registry

   The proposed registry format for the IPv6 address registry is
   indicated by example, using the registry state current as of
   preparation of this document, in Figure 1 (Figure 1).  The registry
   explicitly notes which entity is placing a reservation on an address
   block and notes the defining RFC document for each allocation.

   The proposed format of the registry is a title line, the date of the
   last change to the registry, the registry in a tabular format, notes
   and references.

   The table uses 4 columns.  Within the table, the first column is an
   IPv6 address prefix, using a hexadecimal notation of the address
   prefix and a prefix length.  There are no overlapping address blocks
   in the first column, and the set of address blocks in the registry
   span the entire IPv6 address space.  The second column denotes the
   current disposition of each address block, using notation as derived
   from the defining RFC document.  The third column is a reference to
   the RFC that describes the current disposition of the address block.
   The fourth column uses numeric footnote notation to reference any
   additional text associated with the address block.

   The notes in the registry may include a summary of previous
   disposition status values associated with an address block, as this
   summary is specifically not included in the registry table.  The
   notes are numbered sequentially.

   The reference section uses a conventional citation format.  The
   references include documents referenced in the registry table and
   documents referenced in the notes.

   Notes:

     [0]  The IPv6 address management function was formally delegated to
          IANA in December 1995 [RFC1881].

     [1]  The "unspecified address", the "loopback address", and the IPv6
          Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses are assigned out of the
          0000::/8 address block.

     [2]  0200::/7 was previously defined as an OSI NSAP-mapped prefix set
          [RFC1888]. This definition has been deprecated as of December
          2004 [RFCxxxx].

     [3]  The IPv6 Unicast space encompasses the entire IPv6 address range
          with the exception of FF00::/8. IANA unicast address assignments
          are currently limited to the IPv6 unicast address range of
          2000::/3. IANA assignments from this block are registered in the
          IANA registry: iana-ipv6-unicast-address-assignments

     [4]  FEC0::/10 was previously defined as a Site-Local scoped address
          prefix. This definition has been deprecated as of September 2004

2.1  Notes on Proposed Format Changes to the Registry

   o  The textual preamble at the start of the registry has been
      removed, in deference to the use of standard IPv6 prefix notation
      in the registry.

   o  Binary prefix notation has been replaced by standard IPv6 prefix
      hexadecimal notation, and the fraction of address space column has
      been replaced with the reference to the relevant RFC that defines
      the disposition of the address block.  Footnote references are
      also displayed in a consistent fashion.

   o  The terminology "Unassigned" has been replaced by the more precise
      phrase "Reserved by IETF", indicating the body that has the token
      to permit reassignment of the status of this address block.

   o  The "Formerly Site-Local" entry in the body of the registry has
      been replaced with an explicit reference to deprecation.  A
      similar treatment is proposed for 200::/8, although the RFC number
      for the deprecation document has yet to be assigned.  There is a
      distinction drawn between the current status of a registry and the
      set of registry actions that have lead to the current state.  The

      registry table describes the current status of the registry, while
      the text footnotes are used to describe the set of transactions
      leading to the current state, including any former states.

   o  Annotations that are references to footnotes are included in the
      registry in its own column

   o  The text commentary on unicast, multicast and anycast addresses
      has been removed as there is no distinction between anycast and
      unicast addresses and multicast addresses are explicitly flagged
      in the registry.

   o  A note and a corresponding reference to RFC1881 was added to
      record the formal delegation of the IPv6 address management
      function to IANA.

3.  Global Unicast IPv6 Address Registry

   The proposed registry format for Global Unicast IPv6 address block
   allocations is indicated by example, using the registry state current
   as of preparation of this document, in Figure 2 (Figure 2).  The
   registry notes the current allocations, and does not include any
   notation of intended future allocations or reservations.  All address
   space not listed in this registry forms the IANA unallocated address
   pool, to be allocated by IANA as per the prevailing address
   allocation policies.

   The proposed format of the registry is a title line, the date of the
   last change to the registry, the registry in a tabular format, notes
   and references.

   The table uses 4 columns.  Within the table, the first column is an
   IPv6 address prefix, using a hexadecimal notation of the address
   prefix and a prefix length.  There are no overlapping address blocks
   in the first column.  The entries here describe only IANA allocations
   of address blocks.  Temporary IANA reservations for future
   allocations, allocation expansion windows and any other internal IANA
   states are not described in this registry.  The second column
   describes the current disposition of the address block, either by
   noting the RIR to whom the address block was assigned, or the
   intended use of the address block.  The third column is the date of
   the IANA allocation, including the day of the month.  The fourth
   column uses numeric footnote notation to reference any additional
   text associated with the address block.

   The notes in the registry may include a summary of previous
   disposition status values associated with an address block, as this
   summary is specifically not included in the registry table.  The

   notes are numbered sequentially.

   The reference section uses a conventional citation format.  The
   references include documents referenced in the registry table and
   documents referenced in the notes.

   o  The current registry name "iana-ipv6-tla-assignments" should be
      renamed to "iana-ipv6-unicast-address-assignments".

   o  The title of the registry has been altered to remove the reference
      to "TOP LEVEL AGGREGATION IDENTIFIER".

   o  The TLA and Sub-TLA identifier assignments have been rolled into a
      single set of address prefixes and their assignment.

   o  The text commentary at the start of the registry contents has been
      removed.

   o  Binary value notation of the address prefixes has been removed.

   o  Further commentary on assignments, such as the planned phase out
      of the 6BONE, is placed in a footnote.

   o  The registry continuation lines with three full stops have been
      removed.

   o  Only assigned addresses are listed.  All unassigned addresses,
      marked in the original IANA registry with the assignment note of
      "(future assignment)" have been removed, as has the entry marked
      as "reserved *)".

   o  Address assignments are listed using prefix size notation of the
      actual allocation, rather than reporting the allocation in
      sub-units of /23 prefixes.

   o  The date of the IANA action includes the day of the month as well
      as the month and year.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is advised to adopt these formats for the IPv6 address registry
   and the IPv6 Global Unicast address registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security of the Internet's routing system relies on the ability to
   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address block.
   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that the
   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and
   that there is a trustable reference from the IANA address registry to
   the references Regional Internet Registry (RIR), and a trustable
   reference from the RIR's registry to a Local Internet Registry or end
   user Internet Service Provider.

Internet-Draft             IANA IPv6 Registry              December 2004


   The proposed format for the IANA registry is a small step towards the
   creation of a registry that can be used as a trust point for
   commencing a chain of address validation.  Consideration should be
   given to IANA registry publication formats that are machine
   parseable, and also the use of file signatures and associated
   certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm that the
   registry contents are current, and that they have been published by
   the IANA.

Internet-Draft             IANA IPv6 Registry              December 2004


   As noted in the Security Considerations Section this is a step in the
   direction of updating the IANA address registry to be a seed trust
   point in the operation of validating addresses.  It is noted that
   further study is appropriate to determine what forms of additional
   information and formats should be published to allow systems to use
   this data in a trustworthy manner.

   The format provided here could be provided through the use of a base
   registry format using an XML scheme.  Such an XML scheme for IPv6
   registry specification is not considered in this document, but is a
   topic that is recommended for further study.
