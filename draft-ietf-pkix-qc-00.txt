Abstract

   This Internet-Draft forms a certificate profile for Qualified
   Certificates, based on RFC 2459, for use in the Internet. In this
   document the term Qualified Certificate is used to describe a
   certificate which is aimed to support digital signatures in a context
   which is considered functionally equivalent to the use of handwritten
   signatures.

   This is the first official PKIX WG draft; two unofficial drafts
   labeled <draft-ietf-santesson-qc-0x.txt> were previously distributed
   on the list for comments.

INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


1  Introduction

   This specification is one part of a family of standards for the X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. The standard is
   based on RFC 2459, which defines underlying certificate formats and
   semantics needed for full implementation of this standard.

   The standard profiles the format for a specific type of certificates
   named Qualified Certificates. The term Qualified Certificates, its
   functional relations to legal frameworks and the assumptions that
   affects the scope of this document are defined in section 2.

   Section 3 defines requirements on information content in Qualified
   Certificates.  This profile addresses two fields in the basic certi-
   ficate as well as three certificate extensions.  The certificate
   fields are the subject and issuer fields.  The certificate extensions
   are subject alternative name, certificate policies, and key usage.

   In Section 4, some security considerations are discussed in order to
   clarify the security context in which Qualified Certificates are
   assumed to be utilized. Section 5 contains the references.

   Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1 structures which are not
   already defined in RFC 2459. Appendix B contains Authors Addresses
   and Appendix C contains the IETF Copyright Statement.

   It should be noted that this specification does not define the
   specific semantics of Qualified Certificates, and does not define the
   policies that should be used with them. That is, this document
   defines what information should go into Qualified Certificates, but
   not what that information means. A system that uses Qualified Certi-
   ficates must define its own semantics for the information in Quali-
   fied Certificates. It is expected that laws and corporate policies
   will make these definitions.

2  Requirements and Assumptions

   The term Qualified Certificates is defined in this section with the
   only purpose to clarify the scope of this standard. The actual
   mechanisms that will decide whether a certificate should or should
   not be considered qualified to meet this definition or whether this
   definition is relevant for a particular certificate or service, are
   outside the scope of this standard.

   In this context the term Qualified Certificate defines a certificate
   which has the properties defined in section 2.1, fall within the
   legal assumptions in section 2.2, and have the primary purpose of
   identifying a person with high level of assurance in non-repudiation



Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner                                      [Page 4]





INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


   services, which may protect considerable values.

   Harmonization in the field of Qualified Certificates is essential
   within several aspects that falls outside the scope of RFC 2459. The
   most important aspects that affects the scope of this specification
   are:

   - Definition of names and identity information in order to identify
   the associated subject in a uniform way.
   - Definition of information which identifies the jurisdiction under
   which the CA operates when issuing a particular certificate.
   - Definition of key usage extension usage for Qualified Certificates.
   - Requirements for critical extensions.

2.1  Properties

   A Qualified Certificate as defined in this standard is assumed to
   have the following properties:

   - Issued by a CA that makes a public statement that the certificate
   serves the purpose of a Qualified Certificate, as discussed in sec-
   tion 2.3
   - Indicate a certificate policy consistent with liabilities, prac-
   tices and procedures undertaken by the CA, as discussed in 2.4
   - Be issued to a natural person (living human being).
   - Contain an unmistakable identity based on a pseudonym name or a
   real name of the subject.
   - Exclusively indicates non-repudiation key usage for the certified
   public key.
   - Fully complies with the certificate profile defined in RFC 2459

2.2  Legal framework

   The evidence value and thereby the expected legal status of a digital
   signature is highly dependent on the quality of the signers certifi-
   cate as well as the properties of the signature service used to
   create and verify the signature.

   Current national and local laws in general covers the area of agree-
   ments and signatures, regardless of whether they appear in a physical
   or digital context. There is however a great uncertainty how tradi-
   tional law will be applied to the relatively new digital techniques.
   A key factor for the legal status of digital signatures is whether
   they are used in a context where they are to be considered "function-
   ally equivalent" to handwritten signatures.

   A common characteristic for emerging legal frameworks regarding digi-
   tal signatures is thus to identify some minimum requirements on



Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner                                      [Page 5]





INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


   certificates which are qualified to support digital signatures in a
   context which is considered to be "functional equivalent" with
   handwritten signatures. These requirements may emphasize different
   aspects of certificate issuance and maintenance such as the routines
   for identifying the key holder, revocation routines, liabilities of
   key holders and CAs, accreditation of CAs and information content in
   certificates.

2.3  Statement of Purpose

   For a certificate to serve the purpose of supporting digital signa-
   tures that are legally compatible with handwritten signatures, it is
   assumed that the CA will have to make a public statement which states
   this purpose, presumably published in a CPS.

   The shape of this statement may depend on the governing law under
   which the CA is operating but in general it is assumed that the CA at
   least will have to include in its statement that the certificate:

   - is aimed to be used for verification of digital signatures in a
   context where they are considered "functional equivalent" to hand
   written signatures and;
   - meets all requirements, according to the law under which the CA is
   operating, necessary to support this "functional equivalence".

   The legal effects of this statement will be dependent on the applica-
   ble governing law under which the CA is operating. Within locales
   with no specific regulations concerning digital signatures, the
   statement will only be a declaration of the suitable area of use of
   the certificate. In locales where regulations are extensive and
   specific the statement will be a declaration that the certificate
   complies with all these regulations.

   The function of the statement is thus to assist any concerned entity
   in evaluating the risk associated with creating or accepting signa-
   tures based on a particular certificate.

2.4  Policy Issues

   Certain policy aspects defines the context in which the profile is to
   be understood and used. It is however outside the scope of this pro-
   file to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern ser-
   vices that issues or utilizes certificates according to this profile.

   It is however assumed that the issuing CA will undertake to follow a
   publicly available certificate policy which is consistent with its
   liabilities, practices and procedures.

INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


2.5 Uniqueness of names

   In this draft requirements on name uniqueness are specified by the
   terms "distinguished name" and "unmistakable identity", having the
   following meaning:

   Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501 [X.501] as a
   representation of a directory name, defined as a construct that iden-
   tifies a particular object from among the set of all objects. An
   object can be assigned a distinguished name without being represented
   by an entry in the Directory, but this name is then the name its
   object entry would have had if it were represented in the Directory.
   In the context of qualified certificates, a distinguished name
   denotes a set of attribute values [X.501] which forms a name that is
   unambiguous within a certain domain that forms either a real or a
   virtual DIT (Directory Information Tree)[X.501]. In the case of sub-
   ject names the domain is assumed to be at least the issuing domain of
   the CA.

   An unmistakable identity denotes a set of attributes and/or data ele-
   ments which forms an identity which by unmistakable means relates to
   a specific entity. The unmistakable connection between the identity
   and the entity may be dependent on the context within which the name
   is formed. This context should though be evident for any relying
   party given the information in the certificate. Some contexts, such
   as when identities are based on pseudonym names, may require assis-
   tance from the CA or a registration authority, to obtain a
   corresponding officially registered identity under some predefined
   circumstances, such as investigation of criminal offence.

3  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile

   This section defines a profile for Qualified Certificates. The pro-
   file is based on the Internet certificate profile RFC 2459 which in
   turn is based on the X.509 version 3 format. For full implementation
   of this section implementers are REQUIRED to consult the underlying
   formats and semantics defined in RFC 2459.

   ASN.1 definitions relevant for this section that are not supplied by
   RFC 2459 are supplied in Appendix B.

3.1  Basic Certificate Fields

   This specification provides additional detail regarding the contents
   of two fields in the basic certificate.  These fields are the issuer
   and subject fields.





Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner                                      [Page 7]





INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


3.1.1  Issuer

   The issuer field SHALL contain an unmistakable identity of the organ-
   ization responsible for the certificate which SHALL include a
   registered name of the organization.

   The unmistakable identity SHOULD be evident through examination of
   the present values of the following attribute types:

      domainComponent;
      countryName;
      stateOrProvinceName;
      organizationName;
      commonName; and
      dNQualifier.

   Additional attributes MAY be present but they SHOULD NOT be necessary
   to identify the issuing organization.

   The legal jurisdiction for the issuing CA SHOULD be consistent with
   the issuer name.

   It should be noted, however, that a relying party MAY have to consult
   identified certificate policies and/or the issuer's CPS, in order to
   determine semantics of name fields and legal jurisdiction.

3.1.2 Subject

   The subject field SHALL contain a distinguished name of the subject
   (see 2.5 for definition of distinguished name)

   An unmistakable identity (see 2.5) of the subject(based on registered
   name or a pseudonym name) SHALL be present in the certificate in the
   subject field and/or the PersonalData field in the subjectAltName
   extension (see 3.2.1.)

   If the PersonalData field is empty, the unmistakable identity of the
   subject is determined by just the subject field. If the PersonalData
   field is present, it SHALL contain a complete unmistakable identity
   of the subject. In this case the subject field SHALL still contain a
   complete distinguished name.

   The subject field SHALL include one of the following choices of sets
   of mandatory attributes:

      Choice  I:  countryName commonName
      Choice II:  countryName givenName surname




Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner                                      [Page 8]





INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


   The distinguished name of the subject MAY also be specified by the
   following attributes: dNQualifier; organizationName; organiza-
   tionalUnitName; and postalAddress.  Other attributes may be present
   but MUST NOT be necessary to distinguish the subject name from other
   subject names within the issuer domain.

   The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in which
   other attributes are to be understood. The country attribute does not
   necessarily match the subject's country of citizenship or country of
   residence, nor does it have to match the country of issuance.

   The commonName attribute value when present, SHALL contain a name of
   the subject. This MAY be in the subject's preferred presentation for-
   mat, or a format preferred by the CA, or some other format. Pseu-
   donyms, nicknames and names with spelling other than defined by the
   registered name MAY be used. To understand the nature of the name
   presented in commonName, complying applications may have to examine
   present values of the givenName and surname attributes and if neces-
   sary, the personal data field in the subjectAltName extension.

   The givenName and surname attribute types SHALL, if present, contain
   the registered name of the subject, depending on the laws under which
   the CA prepares the certificate. These attributes SHALL be present in
   the subject field if the commonName attribute is not present.

   The organizationName attribute type and the organizationalUnitName
   attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to store the name and
   relevant information of an organization with which the subject is
   associated. The association between the organization and the subject
   is beyond the scope of this document.

   The postalAddress attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to
   store an address with which the subject is associated. If an organ-
   izationName value also is present then the postalAddress attribute
   value SHALL be associated with the specified organization. The asso-
   ciation between the postalAddress and either the subject or the
   organizationName is beyond the scope of this document.

   The dNQualifier attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to dif-
   ferentiate between two people where the subject field would otherwise
   be identical.  This qualifier has no defined semantics beyond ensur-
   ing uniqueness of subject names.  It MAY contain a number or code
   assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by a government or civil
   authority.  It is the CA's responsibility to ensure that the dNQual-
   ifier is sufficient to resolve any subject name ambiguities.

   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the attributes
   named in this section.

3.2 Certificate Extensions

   This specification provides additional detail regarding the contents
   of three certificate extensions.  These extensions are the subject
   alternative name, certificate policies, and key usage extensions.

3.2.1 Subject Alternative Name

   This section defines a new Object Identifier and data structure in
   the form of a PersonalData field to be in the OtherName subfield of
   the subjectAltName extension.  This field may be used to construct a
   unique name from personal attributes of the subject.  This data may
   be useful to a relying party in identifying the person that is the
   subject of the certificate.

   If the subjectAltName extension contain this PersonalData field, it
   SHALL contain the unmistakable identity of the subject (see 2.5). The
   subject field is still required to hold a distinguished name (within
   issuer domain) as defined in section 3.1.2.


   PersonalData        ::=  SEQUENCE       {
    registrationAuthority      GeneralName          OPTIONAL,
    attributeSemantics         OBJECT IDENTIFIER    OPTIONAL,
    personalDataRecord         SEQUENCE OF PersonalDataRecord }

   PersonalDataRecord  ::=  SEQUENCE       {
    registrationAuthority      GeneralName          OPTIONAL,
    attributeSemantics         OBJECT IDENTIFIER    OPTIONAL,
    personalDataAttributes     SEQUENCE SIZE (1 .. MAX) OF Attribute}

   Attribute  ::=  SEQUENCE {
    type           AttributeType,
    values         SET OF AttributeValue  }

   AttributeType  ::= ATTRIBUTE.&id

   AttributeValue ::= ATTRIBUTE.&Type

   ATTRIBUTE      ::= CLASS {
    &derivation     ATTRIBUTE OPTIONAL,
    &single-valued  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    &id             OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,
    &Type }

   WITH SYNTAX {
    SUBTYPE OF       &derivation
    WITH SYNTAX      &Type

    SINGLE VALUE     &single-valued
    ID           &id }

   The optional registrationAuthority component SHALL when present, be
   used to hold at least one name of the authority within which attri-
   bute values are registered.

   The registrationAuthority component in the PersonalData and the Per-
   sonalDataRecord structure allow to specify multiple registration
   authorities, responsible for different attributes. If the registra-
   tionAuthority field of the PersonalData structure is set, it serves
   as the default value for subordinate PersonalDataRecord structures
   with an empty registrationAuthority value.

   The optional attributeSemantics component SHALL when present, be used
   to hold at least one OID which defines the semantics of present
   attribute values. Each OID may define any set of rules and semantics
   for any set of attributes. The attributeSemantics value may guide
   applications how to understand and present different attribute
   values. This value may also serve to provide the context within which
   certain attribute values are meant to be unique, thereby providing a
   guaranteed uniqueness for the whole PersonalData structure.

   The optional attributeSemantics component in the PersonalData and the
   PersonalDataRecord structure allow to specify multiple object iden-
   tifiers, describing the semantics for different attribute values. If
   the attributeSemantics field of the PersonalData structure is set, it
   serves as the default value for subordinate PersonalData structures
   with an empty attributeSemantics value.

   Complying applications SHALL expect any subset of the following
   defined attribute types within a PersonalDataRecord:

      countryName;
      givenName;
      surname;
      pseudonym;
      dNQualifier;
      dateOfBirth;
      placeOfBirth;
      gender;
      postalAddress;
      countryOfCitizenship; and
      countryOfResidence.

   The PersonalData field may also contain any additional attributes,
   subject to local definitions, but they shall not be necessary to
   determine an unmistakable identity of the subject.



Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner                                     [Page 11]





INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


   Attribute values SHALL be consistent with attribute values stored in
   the subject field. (I.e., the subject field and the PersonalData
   field may contain different values as long as these values are not in
   conflict.)

   The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in which
   other attributes are to be understood. The country attribute does not
   necessarily match the subject's country of citizenship or country of
   residence, nor does it have to match the country of issuance.

   The givenName and surname attribute types SHALL, if present, contain
   a registered name of the subject, depending on the laws under which
   the CA prepares the certificate.

   The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present, contain a pseudonym
   name of the subject. The pseudonym name SHALL be a registered by a
   registration authority, responsible for holding the identity of the
   real physical person related to the pseudonym. When this attribute is
   used the CA is the default registration authority if no other regis-
   trationAuthority value, related to the pseudonym attribute, is
   present in the PersonalData field.

   The dNQualifier attribute SHALL, when present, be used to store a
   local registration identifier of the subject, such as a drivers
   license or government aid registration. Note that the value of this
   field may contain digits, alphabetic characters, and punctuation.

   The dateOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, hold the value of the
   date of birth of the subject. The manner in which the date of birth
   is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

   The placeOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, hold the value of the
   place of birth of the subject. The manner in which the place of birth
   is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

   The gender attribute SHALL, when present, hold the value of the
   gender of the subject. For females the value "F" and for males the
   value "M" have to be used. The manner in which the gender is associ-
   ated with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

   The postalAddress attribute SHALL, when present, hold the value of an
   address with which the subject is associated. This value SHALL be
   associated with the subject as a private address even if the pos-
   talAddress attribute value in the subject field is associated with an
   organization. The manner in which the postalAddress is associated
   with the subject is outside the scope of this document.

   The countryOfCitizenship attribute SHALL, when present, be used to



Santesson, Polk, Gloeckner                                     [Page 12]





INTERNET DRAFT                                          February 3, 1998


   hold the identifier of at least one of the subject's claimed country
   of citizenship at the time that the certificate is created. If the
   subject is a citizen of more than one country, more than one country
   MAY be present. Determination of citizenship is a matter of law and
   is outside the scope of this document.

   The countryOfResidence attribute SHALL, when present, hold the value
   of at least one country in which the subject is resident. If the sub-
   ject is a resident of more than one country, more than one country
   MAY be present. Determination of residence is a matter of law and is
   outside the scope of this document.

3.2.2 Certificate Policies

   The certificate policies extension SHALL contain at least one certi-
   ficate policy which reflects the practices and procedures undertaken
   by the CA.  The certificate policy extension MAY be marked critical.

   A statement by the issuer stating the purpose of the certificate as
   discussed in 2.3 SHOULD be evident through an indicated policy or
   through its associated CPS.

3.2.3 Key usage extension

   The key usage extension SHALL be present and SHALL exclusively assert
   the key usage nonRepudiation (1). No other key usage values are
   allowed to be asserted. The key usage extension MAY be marked criti-
   cal.

4  Security Considerations

   The legal value of a digital signature which is validated with a
   Qualified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the policy
   governing the use of the associated private key. Both the private key
   holder as well as the relying party should make sure that the private
   key is used only with the consent of the legitimate key holder and
   only after the key holders conscious acceptance of the signed message
   content.

   Since the public keys will be used to verify digital signatures as a
   substitute for handwritten signatures, certain conditions should
   exist before CAs recognize certificates as qualified certificates.
   The signatures must be unique to the signer, and must be generated
   under the signer's sole control.  That is, a CA should not issue a
   qualified certificate if the private key is shared among entities, or
   the signature generation is not performed under the subject's con-
   trol.  This implies the CA must perform proof-of-possession. In addi-
   tion, the CA should have some knowledge about the subject's

   cryptographic module.

   CAs should not issue CA certificates with policy mapping extensions
   indicating a CA may issue qualified certificates unless these condi-
   tions are met.

   Finally, matching rules are not specified for the new attrributes
   defined for use in the PersonalData field. It is not expected that
   two qualified certificates would be compared to determine if they
   represent the same physical entity.  Such a comparison may provide
   misleading results and should not be performed.

   This specification is a profile of RFC 2459.  The security considera-
   tions section of that document applies to this specification as well.

Appendix A. ASN.1 definitions

   As in RFC 2459, ASN.1 modules are supplied in two different variants
   of the ASN.1 syntax.

   Section A.1 is basically in the 1988 syntax, and does not use macros.
   The ASN.1 syntax does not permit the inclusion of type statements in
   the ASN.1 module, and the 1993 ASN.1 standard does not permit use of
   the new UNIVERSAL types in modules using the 1988 syntax.  However,
   the UniversalString and UTF8String choices in DirectoryString were
   defined in the 1993 and 1998 versions respectively. As a result, it
   was necessary to import definitions for these UNIVERSAL types from
   the PKIX1 modules.  This appendix may be converted into 1988 ASN.1 by
   replacing the definitions for the UNIVERSAL Types with the 1988
   catch-all "ANY".

   Section A.2 is in the 1998 syntax; it may be converted into the 1993
   syntax by inserting a definition for the UNIVERSAL Type UTF8String.
