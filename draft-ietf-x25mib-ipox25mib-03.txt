          1.1.  Revision History

          June 1992

          The June 1992 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number 2.4)
          incorporated several comments of the mailing list.  These
          changes are as follows:

               The range and description of mioxPleMaxCircuits was
               expanded.

               The following objects were added:
               mioxPleEnAddrToX121LkupFlrTime,
               mioxPleX121ToEnAddrLkupFlrTime, mioxPleQbitFailures,
               mioxPleQbitFailureRemoteAddress, mioxPleQbitFailureTime,
               mioxPleMinimumOpenTimer, mioxPleInactivityTimer,
               mioxPleHoldDownTimer, mioxPleCollisionRetryTimer.

               The following objects were deleted:
               mioxPeerMinimumOpenTimer, mioxPeerHoldDownTimer,
               mioxPeerQbitErrors.

          May 1992

          The April 1992 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number
          2.2) incorporated the comments of the March working group
          meeting.  These changes are as follows:

               The overview section was expanded to better explain the
               relationship between the objects defined in this MIB and
               other MIB extensions.

               The name of the MIB was change from IP over X.25 to
               MultiProtocol Interconnect over X.25.

               All references to IP addresses were changed to
               Encapsulation Addresses.

               All references to X25Address were changed to X121Address.

               The ioxInfoTable was renamed the mioxPleTable because it
               contains information relative to a PLE.

               The ioxConTable was renamed the mioxPeerTable.

               The mioxPeerConnectSeconds object was added.

               The mioxPeerDescr object was added.

               The mioxPeerEncTable was added.

               Some objects were re-ordered and some descriptions were
               expanded.

          February 1992

          The February 1992 release (Editor's Internal Reference Number
          1.17) made the following changes:

               The ioxInfoDefaultParamId object was added to the
               ioxInfoTable.

               The ioxConX25Channel object was deleted from the
               ioxConTable and replaced with the ioxConX25CircuitId
               object.

               The ioxConX25Address object was added to the ioxConTable.

               The ioxConX25FcltyIndex, ioxConX25fcltyCcittIndex, and
               ioxConX25CallParamIndex objects were deleted from the
               ioxConTable and replaced with the ioxConX25CallParamId
               object.

               The ioxConEncapsulation and ioxConHoldDownTimer objects
               were added to the ioxConTable.

               The text at the beginning of the document was changed.

               The references were changed to match the new text.

          October 1991

          The October 91 revision of this document (Editor's internal
          reference 1.14) had the following changes:

               The object ioxInfoAddressXlationFailures was split into
               ioxInfoIpToX25LookupFailures  and
               ioxInfoX25ToIpLookupFailures. The objects
               ioxInfoLastFailedIpAddress  and
               ioxInfoLastFailedX25Address were added. This provides
               information to allow for correction of errors as well as
               detection.

               The objects ioxConX25FcltyIndex,
               ioxConX25fcltyCcittIndex, and ioxConX25CallParamIndex
               were added.

          June 1991

          The June revision of this document was synthesized from
          various ideas on how to manage IP over X.25.  This initial
          release of this document serves as a basis of discussion in
          the X25mib working group.

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
          (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
          based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
          managing MultiProtocol Interconnect (including IP) traffic
          carried over X.25.  The objects defined here, along with the
          objects in the "SNMP MIB extension for the Packet Layer of
          X.25"[10], "SNMP MIB extension for LAPB"[9], and the
          "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware
          Devices"[8], combine to allow management of the traffic over
          an X.25 protocol stack.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  These components give the rules for
          defining objects, the definitions of objects, and the protocol
          for manipulating objects.

          The network management framework structures objects in an
          abstract information tree. The branches of the tree name
          objects and the leaves of the tree contain the values
          manipulated to effect management. This tree is called the
          Management Information Base or MIB. The concepts of this tree
          are given in RFC 1155 "The Structure of Management
          Information" or SMI [1]. The SMI defines the trunk of the tree
          and the types of objects used when defining the leaves. RFC
          1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4], defines a more
          concise description mechanism that preserves all the
          principals of the SMI.

          The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols
          can be found in RFC 1156 [2] "Management Information Base for
          Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets". RFC 1213 [5]
          defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I with changes to
          incorporate implementation experience and new operational
          requirements.

          RFC 1157 [3] defines the SNMP protocol itself. The protocol
          defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.

          The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined
          for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name
          and type.  Object names and types are defined using the subset
          of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6] defined in the SMI
          [1].  Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers,
          administratively assigned names, to specify object types.  The
          object name, together with an optional object instance,
          uniquely identifies a specific instance of an object.  For
          human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
          OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to objects.

          Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language [6] provides the primitives used for this purpose.
          The SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may
          be used for simplicity and ease of implementation.  The
          encoding of an object type simply describes how to represent
          an object using ASN.1 encoding rules [7], for purposes of
          dealing with the SNMP protocol.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains the specification of all object types
          contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined
          using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the
          extensions specified in "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [4].

          5.  Overview

          Instances of the objects defined below provide management
          information for Multi-Protocol Interconnect traffic on X.25.
          These objects are organized into three tables:  the
          mioxPleTable, the mioxPeerTable, and the mioxPeerEncTable.

          The mioxPleTable defines information relative to an interface
          used to carry MultiProtocol Interconnect traffic over X.25.
          Such interfaces are identified by an ifType object in the
          Internet-standard MIB [5] of ddn-x25 or rfc877-x25.
          Interfaces of type ddn-x25 have a self contained algorithm for
          translating between IP addresses and X.121 addresses.
          Interfaces of type rfc877-x25 do not have such an algorithm.
          Note that not all X.25 Interfaces will be used to carry
          MultiProtocol Interconnect traffic. Those interfaces not
          carrying such traffic will not have entries in the
          mioxPleTable.  The entries in the mioxPleTable are only for
          interfaces that do carry MultiProtocol Interconnect traffic
          over X.25.  Interfaces that do have entries in the
          mioxPleTable have mioxPleIndex object instance identifiers
          that match the values of their respective ifIndex object
          instance identifiers.  This relationship allows the value of
          an index object instance from the mioxPleTable below to be
          directly used to identify the corresponding instances of the
          objects for the interface to X.25.

          The mioxPeerTable contains information needed to contact an
          X.25 Peer to exchange packets.  This includes information such
          as the X.121 address of the peer and a pointer to the X.25
          call parameters needed to place the call.  The instance
          identifiers used for the objects in this table are independent
          of any interface or other tables defined outside this MIB.
          This table contains the ifIndex value of the X.25 interface to
          use to call a peer.

          The mioxPeerEncTable contains information about the
          encapsulation type used to communicate with a peer.  This
          table is an extension of the mioxPeerTable in its instance
          identification. Each entry in the mioxPeerTable may have zero
          or more entries in this table.  This table will not have any
          entries that do not have correspondent entries in
          mioxPeerTable.

                  underCreation indicates a newly created
                          entry which isn't yet in use because the
                          creating management station is still setting
                          values.

                          The value of invalid indicates the entry is
                          no longer in use and the agent is free to
                          delete the entry at any time.  A management
                          station is also free to use an entry in the
                          invalid state.

                          Entries are created by setting a value of
                          createRequest.  Only non-existent or invalid
                          entries can be set to createRequest.  Upon
                          receiving a valid createRequest, the agent
                          will create an entry in the underCreation
                          state.  This object can not be set to a
                          value of underCreation directly, entries can
                          only be created by setting a value of
                          createRequest.  Entries that exist in other
                          than the invalid state can not be set to
                          createRequest.

                          Entries with a value of underCreation are
                          not used by the system and the management
                          station can change the values of other
                          objects in the table entry.  Management
                          stations should also remember to configure
                          values in the mioxPeerEncTable with the same
                          peer index value as this peer entry.

                          An entry in the underCreation state can be
                          set to valid or invalid.  Entries in the
                          underCreation state will stay in that state
                          until 1) the agent times them out, 2) they
                          are set to valid, 3) they are set to
                          invalid.  If an agent notices an entry has
                          been in the underCreation state for an
                          abnormally long time, it may decide the
                          management station has failed and invalidate
                          the entry.  A prudent agent will understand
                          that the management station may need to wait
                          for human input and will allow for that
                          possibility in its determination of this
                          abnormally long period.

                          Once a management station has completed all
                          fields of an entry, it will set a value of
                          valid.  This causes the entry to be
                          activated.

                          Entries in the valid state may also be set
                          to makeCall or clearCall to make or clear
                          X.25 calls to the peer.  After such a set
                          request the entry will still be in the valid
                          state.  Setting a value of makeCall causes
                          the agent to initiate an X.25 call request
                          to the peer specified by the entry.  Setting
                          a value of clearCall causes the agent to
                          initiate clearing one X.25 call present to
                          the peer.  Each set request will initiate
                          another call or clear request (up to the
                          maximum allowed); this means that management
                          stations that fail to get a response to a
                          set request should query to see if a call
                          was in fact placed or cleared before
                          retrying the request.  Entries not in the
                          valid state can not be set to makeCall or
                          clearCall.

                          The values of makeCall an clearCall provide
                          for circuit control on devices which perform
                          Ethernet Bridging using static circuit
                          assignment without address recognition;
                          other devices which dynamically place calls
                          based on destination addresses may reject
                          such requests.

                          An agent that (re)creates a new entry
                          because of a set with createRequest, should
                          also (re)create a mioxPeerEncTable entry
                          with the mioxPeerEncPeerIndex that matches
                          the mioxPeerIndex, a mioxPeerEncEncIndex of
                          1, and a mioxPeerEncType of 204 (hex CC)."
