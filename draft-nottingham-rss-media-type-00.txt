Internet-Draft     The application/rss+xml Media Type       October 2001


1. Introduction

   RSS is a lightweight, multipurpose, extensible metadata description
   and syndication format.  RSS is an XML application.

   RSS is currently used for a number of applications, including news
   and other headline syndication, weblog syndication, and the
   propogation of software update lists.  It is generally used for any
   situation when a machine-readable list of textual items and/or
   metadata about them needs to be distributed.

   There are a number of revisions [2][3][4][5] of the RSS format
   defined, many of which are actively used.  This memo defines a media
   type, application/rss+xml for all versions of RSS.

2. Registration Information

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/rss+xml

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: rss+xml

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      charset

      Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in
      RFC3023 [1].

      revision

      The optional revision parameter indicates the version of RSS used;
      the value is specified by the target RSS version.  In practice,
      this value should be an XML Namespace [6], if defined (e.g.,
      'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/' for RSS 1.0), or a revision number if
      not (e.g., "0.92" for RSS 0.92).

   Encoding considerations:

      Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as specified in
      RFC3023 [1].

   Security considerations:
