Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing
   (XCON), which is applicable to participants using various call
   signalling protocols (such as SIP, H.323, Jabber, HTML, PSTN, etc.)
   and exchanging media over networks with potentially different
   characteristics.

   The XCON Framework defines the XCON data model, the XCON logical
   entities, the naming conventions, and outlines the standard
   conferencing protocols (complementary to the call control signalling
   protocols) for building advanced conferencing applications.  The
   framework binds all the defined components together for the benefit
   of conferencing system builders.

   The XCON Framework is compatible with the functional model presented
   in the SIPPING Conferencing Framework [9] .  Section 9 of this
   document discusses the relationship between the XCON Framework and
   the SIPPING Conferencing framework, in the context of the XCON
   architecture.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   The XCON Framework document both generalizes, when appropriate,  the
   SIPPING Conferencing Framework [9] terminology and introduces new
   concepts as listed below.

   Active Conference: The term Active Conference refers to a Conference
      Object that's been created (for example, using a "blueprint") and
      "activated" via the allocation of its identifiers (i.e.
      Conference Object Identifier, Conference Identifier)  and  the
      associated  Focus.
   Call (Control) Signalling: The protocol used between a participant
      and a Focus.  In this context, the term "call" means a  channel or
      session used for media streams establishment.  Protocol examples
      include SIP, H.323, MSRP, Jabber, HTML and PSTN signalling.  This
      interface is not limited to the listed protocols, however, other
      than references to general functionality required (e.g.
      establishment and teardown), details of these protocols are
      outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   Common Conference Information: The data type (i.e. the XML schema)
      which is used to represent the fixed information part of a
      Conference Object.  It includes a common set of definitions for
      basic conference features, such as conference identifiers,
      membership, signalling, capabilities, media, etc.
   Conference Control Protocol (CCP): A protocol used by clients to
      manipulate a Conference Object [Section 7.3].
   Conference Factory: A logical entity that, upon request, generates
      unique URI(s) to identify and represent a conference Focus.  The
      Conference Factory is typically used in the conference creation
      process via a signalling interface and non-signalling methods such
      as Conference Control Protocol [Section 7.3] and proprietary
      mechanisms.
   Conference Identifier(ID): The call signalling protocol-specific URI
      that uniquely identifies a Conference Instance and a conference
      Focus.
   Conference Instance: Represents the internal implementation of a
      conference; addressable using the Conference Identifier.  There is
      a one-to-one mapping between a Conference Instance and a
      conference Focus.
   Conference Object: A Conference Object is a logical representation of
      a Conference Instance at a certain stage (e.g. description upon
      conference creation, reservation, activation, etc.), which a
      Conferencing System maintains in order to describe the system
      capabilities and to provide access to the available services
      provided by the Conferencing System.  All Conference Objects are
      of type 'Conference Object Type' which is comprised of two
      distinct sub components; the 'Common Conference Information' and
      the 'Conference Template' (see definitions in this section for
      details).
   Conference Object Identifier (ID): A [TBD schema name] URI which
      uniquly identifies a Conference Object and is being used by a
      Conference Control Protocol [Section 7.3].
   Conference policies: A term which is used to collectively refer to a
      virtual set of rights, permissions and  limitations pertaining to
      operations being performed on a certain Conference Object.  The
      term is described in more details in Section 4.3.
   Conference State: The state of a Conference Instance as represented
      using the Conference Package mechanism defined in [11].
   Conferencing System: The term used to refer to a conferencing
      solution (system) that is based on the set of specifications and
      is built using the protocols and the data model defined by the
      XCON working group within the IETF.
   Conference Template: The data type (i.e. the XML schema) which is
      used to represent the variable information part of the Conference
      Object.  It can be included in the Conference Object to represent
      enhanced conferencing capabilities (e.g. media mixers, etc.)
      and/or user interface abstraction.

   Floor: A term which is used to refer to a set of data or resources
      associated with a Conference Instance, for which a conference
      participant (or group of participants) is granted temporary input
      access.
   Floor Chair: A Floor control protocol compliant client (human
      participant or automated entity) who is authorized to manage
      access to one floor (grants, denies, or revokes a floor).  The
      floor chair does not have to be a participant in the Conference
      Instance.
   Focus: Focus is a logical entity that maintains the call signalling
      interface between each participating client (i.e. participant) and
      the Conference Instance.  As such, the Focus acts as an endpoint
      for each of the supported signalling protocols and is responsible
      for all primary conference membership operations (e.g. join,
      leave, update the Conference Instance) and for media negotiation/
      maintenance between a conference participant and the Focus.  There
      is a one-to-one mapping between the Focus and its Conference
      Instance.  Focus is addressed by explicitly associated unique
      conference URIs for each signalling protocol, supported for its
      Conference Instance.
   Media Graph: The logical representation of the flow of media for a
      conference.
   Media Mixer: A logical entity that has the capability to combine
      media inputs of the same type (or/and transcode the media) and
      distribute the result(s) to a single or multiple outputs.  In this
      context, the term "media" means any type of data being delivered
      over the network using appropriate transport means, such as RTP/
      RTCP (defined in RFC 3550[7]), Message Session Relay Protocol
      (defined in [25]), etc.
   Registered Template Definition: 'Registered Template Definition' is
      the term used to refer to an official standards document (RFC)
      that defines and registers a Conference Template schema with the
      appropriate standards body (IANA).  A 'Registered Template
      Definition' also includes any complimentary textual information in
      relation to the conference template schema and its meaning.
   Role: Represents differing membership categories that a conference
      participant can assume within a conference.  Each category has a
      difference set of conference operations that a participant can
      perform.  A default (e.g.  Standard Conference Participant) 'Role'
      will always exist which provides a standard user with a set of
      basic conference operations.  Any user with appropriate
      authentication and authorization may assume a role that has a
      wider set of conference operations that are otherwise not
      available (to a standard Conference Participant) - e.g.  A 'Role'
      called 'Conference Moderator' may exist that has additional
      conference operations such as 'modify conference end time'.

3.  Overview

   A centralized conference is an association of endpoints (called
   conference participants) with a central endpoint (called a conference
   Focus) where the Focus has direct peer-wise relationships with the
   participants by maintaining a separate call control signalling
   interface with each.  Consequently, in this tightly coupled model,
   the call control signalling graph is always a star.

   The most basic conference supported would be an ad-hoc unmanaged
   conference, which would not necessarily require any of the
   functionality defined within this framework.  For example, it could
   be supported using basic SIP signalling functionality with a
   participant serving as the Focus; the SIPPING Conferencing Framework
   [9] together with the SIP Call Control Conferencing for User
   Agents[15] documents address these types of scenarios.

   An XCON-compliant Conferencing System, in addition to the basic
   features, can offer richer functionality including dedicated
   conferencing applications with explicitly defined capabilities,
   reserved reoccurring conferences, and the standard protocols for
   managing and controlling different conference aspects.

   The core requirements for tightly managed centralized conferencing
   are outlined in [10].  These requirements are applicable for
   conferencing systems using various call control signalling protocols,
   not restricted to SIP alone.  Additional conferencing requirements
   are provided in [12], [13], and [14].

   The XCON architecture is built around a fundamental concept of a
   Conference Object.  A Conference Object is a logical representation
   of a Conference Instance.  For conference creation, a Conference
   Object provides a "blueprint" representing the System Capabilities.
   A conference object also provides the logical representation of a
   conference during each of the various stages of a conference (e.g.
   reservation, active, completed, etc.).  A Conference Object is
   accessible using XCON protocols (e.g. a Conference Control Protocol
   [Section 7.3].

   A Conferencing System can support any subset of the conferencing
   functions depicted in the Conferencing System logical decomposition
   in Figure 1  and described in this document.  Nevertheless, typically
   advanced functions could not be implemented without implementing
   others.  For example, the Notification Service is an essential
   component required for implementing almost any advanced functionality

   and being used, among other things, for correlation of information
   (such as list of participants with their media streams) between
   otherwise distinct functions.

   The media graph of a conference can be centralized, de-centralized,

   or any combination of both and potentially differ per media type.  In
   the centralized case, the media sessions are established between the
   focus and each one of the participants.  In de-centralized (i.e.
   distributed) case, the media graph is a (multicast or multi-unicast)
   mesh among the participants.  Consequently, the media processing
   (e.g. mixing) can be performed either by the focus alone or by the
   participants.  The concepts in this framework document clearly map to
   a centralized media model.  They can also apply to the de-centralized
   media case, however, the details of such are left for future study by
   XCON charter.

   Section 4 of this document provides more details on the Conference
   Object.  Section 5  provides an overview of the identifiers necessary
   to address and manage the Conference Objects, Instances and Users
   associated with a Conferencing System.  Section 6 of this document
   describes how a Conferencing System is logically built using the
   defined data model and how the Conference Objects are maintained.
   Section 7 describes the fundamental conferencing mechanisms and
   provides a high level overview of the XCON protocols.  Section 8 then
   provides realizations of various conferencing scenarios, detailing
   the manipulation of the Conference Objects using XCON defined
   protocols.  Section 9 of this document summarizes the relationship
   between the XCON Framework and the SIPPING Conferencing Framework.

4.  XCON Data Model

   The XCON data model defined in this framework has no strict
   separation between conference membership, conference media
   information and the related policies (i.e. the capabilities and
   limitations for each).  This approach meets the requirement in many
   conference control operations to enable synchronized access to the
   conference policies as a whole, to the conference state as a whole,
   and for receiving notifications about changes to either.

   A Conference Object is of type 'Conference Object Type' which is
   comprised of two distinct components: the 'Common Conference
   Information Type' and the 'Conference Template Type', as illustrated
   in Figure 2.  Each of these types is a placeholder for including
   potentially multiple sub-types.

              Figure 2: Conference Object Type Decomposition.

   Since, in an XCON-compliant system the same Conference Object Type is
   used for representation of a conference for different purposes, such
   as expressing Conferencing System capabilities, reserving
   conferencing resources or reflecting the state of ongoing
   conferences, each of the two components (i.e., the Common Conference
   Information and the Conference Template) is syntactically optional to
   be included in a particular Conference Object.  Section 6 describes
   the usage semantics of the Conference Objects.

   the organization of the Common Conference Information and the
   Conference Template) is an open issue (Discussion Point 4 on the
   mailing list), which has been summarized as the three potential
   alternatives below:

   1.  The top-level information is the template section, and it
   contains a subsection that is the common conference information.
   This has the advantage that the schema can all be well defined:
   because the common conference information is known at the time the
   template is developed, the appropriate schema definition can be
   inserted into the template schema.  The downside is that this setup
   requires navigation of the template information to get to the common
   information, which is likely to be manipulated most frequently.

   2.  The top-level information is the common conference information,
   which contains the template information.  This has the advantage that
   clients don't even need to care about the template being used to
   allow rendering and control over basic conference functionality(which
   will suffice for many clients (e.g. those with limited screen).  The
   downside is that the common conference information schema must
   include an extension point to allow new templates to hook into the
   schema.  This may make schema validation more difficult.

   3.  The template information and common conference information are
   conveyed as two separate objects (e.g. using multipart MIME).  This
   provides the benefits of allowing completely separate schema,
   straightforward schema validation, and easy access to the common
   conference information.  The downside is that any mechanism for
   separating the schema is going to add some amount of protocol
   complexity and the need for synchronization between the two data
   objects.  Note that it has been argued that it is increasingly
   difficult to find a potential client of the XCON protocols that
   doesn't already support multipart MIME).

   The model put forth in this document is the result of the consensus
   reached during the XCON second interim meeting in Boston and depicts
   option 2 above.  With slight adaptations it can also support option
   3. ]

4.1  Common Conference Information

   The common conference information section contains the core
   information that is utilized in any conference and can be abstracted
   regardless of the specific conference media nature (e.g. the mixing
   algorithms performed, the advanced floor control applied, etc.).
   Typically, participants with read-only access to the conference
   information would be interested in this common information only.




Barnes, et al.          Expires October 31, 2005               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   The basic common conference information can be represented using the
   conference-info-type schema as defined in [11].  This schema contains
   the definitions for representation of the Conference Object
   capabilities, membership, roles, call control signalling and media
   statuses relevant to different stages of the conference life-cycle.

   New XCON specifications can extend the basic conference-info-type and
   introduce additional schemas to be used within the common conference
   information type placeholder.

4.2  Conference Template

   The concept of a "Conference Template" is introduced to abstract the
   complexity and the details of the "mixer" and other conferencing
   features and to allow for easy user interface abstraction for
   advanced Conferencing Systems.

   Each Conference Template needs to be registered with IANA.  The IANA
   registration needs to point to an RFC having the text description of
   the feature behavior and optionally the XML definition allowing the
   feature presentation, configuration, and management.  RFCs of this
   kind are referred by XCON documents as a "Registered Template
   Definitions".

   Typically, a conference template would contain the information about
   the specific media mixing details, the associated client roles and
   the available floor controls.  This information would allow
   authorized clients to manipulate mixer's behavior and the resultant
   distribution of the media to all or individual participants.  By
   doing so,  a client can change its own state and/or state of other
   participants in the conference.

   A conference template can also include an abstract user interface
   definition in terms of sliders, radio boxes, etc. for simplifying
   user interaction with a specific non-trivial feature.

4.3  Conference policies

   Conference policies is the term used to collectively refer to a
   virtual set of rights, permissions and  limitations pertaining to
   operations being performed on a certain Conference Object.

   The virtual set of rights describes the read/write access privileges
   for the Conference Object as a whole.  This access would usually be
   granted and defined in terms of giving the read-only or read-write
   access to clients with certain roles in the conference.  For details
   see [TBD].

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   The  permissions and limits are specified as an integral part of the
   Conference Object Type, with data objects containing the allowed
   ranges for other data objects (e.g. maximum number of participants)
   and lists of clients allowed to perform certain operations on a
   conference object.  For example, the "allowed to join" list of
   participants is consulted to decide who is allowed to join.  The
   entries in the list can specify the identity of an individual user
   (joe@example.com), a role, a domain  (*@example.com), etc.  For
   details see [TBD].

   A more general rule mechanism, beyond the functionality provided by
   the permissions and limits, is an item for future study for the XCON
   WG.

5.  XCON Identifiers

   This section  provides details of the identifiers associated with the
   XCON constructs (e.g.  Conference Object and Conference Instance) and
   the identifiers necessary to address and manage the clients
   associated with a Conferencing System.  An overview of the
   allocation, characteristics and functional role of the identifiers is
   provided.

5.1  Conference Object Identifier

   In order to make each Conference Object externally accessible, the
   Conferencing System allocates a unique URI per distinct Conference
   Object in the system, as defined in [ref:TBD].  A Conference Control
   Protocol [as outlined in Section 7.3] can then be used for directly
   manipulating a particular Conference Object and for obtaining its
   current state.

   The Conference Object URI acts as a top level identifier for an
   'umbrella style' construct within the Conference System for the
   purpose of identifying incoming connections for complimentary XCON
   protocols (e.g.  BFCP).  This implicit binding provides a structured
   mapping of the various XCON protocols with the associated Conference
   Object Identifier.  As an example, Figure 3 illustrates how BFCP
   connections fall under the general Conference Object identifier
   umbrella.

                   Figure 3: Conference Object Mapping.

   In Figure 3, the Conference Object Identifier acts as the top level
   key in the identification process.  The BFCP protocol, as defined in
   [24], defines the 'conf-id' identifier which represents a conference
   instance within Floor Control.  BFCP also defines the 'floorid'
   identifier for specific floors within a Conference instance.  When
   created within the Conference System, the 'conf-id' has a 1:1 mapping
   to the unique XCON Conference Object Identifier.  Using the BFCP
   example, the Conference System is able to map the floor request to
   the associated Conference Object.

   This umbrella style association can be applied to any supplementary
   mechanisms that are applied to the XCON model defined in this
   document as long as a unique reference per conference instance is
   available that can be mapped to a Conference Object.

   [Editor's Note: The URI schema name per TBD must be registered with
   IANA.]

5.2  Conference Identifier

   The Conference Identifier (ID) is the call signalling protocol-
   specific URI that uniquely identifies a Conference Instance and a
   conference Focus.  The Conference Factory is the logical entity that
   generates the unique Conference ID to identify and represent a
   conference Focus.  The Conference Factory is typically used in the
   conference creation process via a signalling interface and non-

   signalling methods such as Conference Control Protocol [Section 7.3]
   and proprietary mechanisms.

   A Conference Instance is an internal implementation construct of a
   conference, which is accessible by call signalling means, thus no
   explicit identifier is required.  Note that a Conference Instance can
   have more than a single Conference Identifier, for example, for each
   call signalling protocol supported.  There is a one-to-one mapping
   between a Conference Instance and a conference Focus.  The Focus is
   addressed by explicitly associating unique Conference IDs for each
   signalling protocol supported by its Conference Instance.

   A single Conference Instance can be internally mapped to a single or
   multiple Conference Objects; each of them accessible by a Call
   Control protocol.  The mapping details are an implementation decision
   and out of scope of this framework.

5.3  Conference User Identifier

   Section 5.1 discusses the concept of an umbrella mechanism for
   associating various protocol identifiers with a top level XCON
   identifier.  This section outlines a similar umbrella mechanism for
   the purpose of correlating users of supplementary XCON protocols
   under one universal XCON identity within an XCON Conference System.

   It is important to emphasize that the Conference User Identifier
   being described must be in the context of the Conference System.
   This is due to the requirement for identity of Conference System
   users who may not be participating in a Conference Instance.
   Examples being a non participating 'Floor Control Chair' or 'Media
   Policy' Controller.  Users can then be associated with Conference
   Objects as defined in Section 5.1.  This association enables the
   Conference System to associate and enforce user level policies at
   both a system level and Conference Object level.

   Each user within a Conference System is allocated a unique Conference
   User Identifier, as defined in [TBD].  This identifier acts as a top
   level identifier, in a similar fashion to that defined for the
   Conference Object Identifier described in Section 5.1.  User
   identifiers defined in other protocols that are used within a
   Conference Instance fall underneath the top level identifier and
   enable the Conference System to correlate and map authentication
   under the single user umbrella.

   Figure 4 illustrates an example using the Conference User Identifier
   in association with the user identity defined for BFCP and SIP Digest
   user identity as defined in RFC3261[4]

                   Figure 4: Conference Object Mapping.

   Within a Conference System, a user is identified by a single
   Conference User Identifier.  Any other XCON mechanisms that contain a
   protocol specific user ID can be associated with the 'Conference User
   Identifier', as illustrated in Figure 4.  This mechanism allows
   conference systems to manage and relate system wide user identities
   in relation to specific Conference Objects and helps in the
   enforcement of system wide policies.

6.  Conferencing System Realization

   XCON-compliant implementations can range from systems supporting ad-
   hoc conferences, with default behavior only, to sophisticated systems
   with the ability to schedule re-occurring conferences (each with
   distinct characteristics), being integrated with external resource
   reservation tools, and providing snapshots of the conference
   information at any of the stages of the conference life-cycle.

   A Conference Object is the logical representation of a Conference
   Instance at a certain stage, such as capabilities description upon
   conference creation, reservation, activation, etc., which a
   Conferencing System maintains in order to describe the system
   capabilities and to provide access to the available services provided
   by the Conferencing System.

   Consequently, the XCON specifications don't mandate the actual usage
   of the Conference Object, but rather defines the general cloning tree
   concept and the mechanisms required for its realization, which is
   described in detail in Section 6.1.

   Adhoc and advanced conferencing examples are provided in Section 6.2

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   and Section 6.3, with the latter providing additional description of
   the Conference Object in terms of the stages of a conference,  to
   support scheduled and other advanced conference capabilites.

   The scheduling of a conference based on these concepts and mechanisms
   is then detailed  in Section 6.4

6.1  Cloning Tree

   The concept defined in this section is a logical representation only,
   as it is reflected through the XCON mechanisms: the URIs and the
   protocols.  Of course, the actual system realization can differ from
   the presented model and doesn't require physical copying of the
   information, etc.

   Any Conference Object in a Conferencing System is created by either
   being explicitly cloned from an existing parent object or being
   implicitly cloned from a default system object.  This document uses
   the "cloning" metaphor instead of the "inheritance" metaphor because
   it more closely fits the object replication and extension concept,
   rather than data type re-usage and extension concept.

   By default, all the data existing in the parent object is copied to
   the newly created object.

   The cloning operation needs to specify whether the link between the
   parent and the child needs to be maintained in the system or not.  If
   no link between the parent and the child exists, the objects become
   independent and the rest of the cloning process doesn't apply.

   Once the new object is created, it can be addressed by a unique
   Conference Object URI assigned by the system, as described in
   Section 5.1

   By default, the newly created object can expand the data it contains,
   within the schema types supported by the parent, just as an
   independent object can.  It can also restrict the read/write access
   to its objects, but unlike an independent object, cannot relax it
   relative to its parents access.

   Any piece of data in the child object can be independently accessed
   and, by default, can be independently modified without affecting the
   parent data.

   On the other hand, the parent object can enforce a different policy
   by marking certain data elements as "parent enforceable".  The values
   of these data objects can not be changed by directly accessing the
   child object; neither can they be expanded in the child object alone.

   In the future, XCON specifications may introduce logical
   relationships, in addition to the "parent enforceable",  between
   elements being cloned from one another.

   realized.

6.2  Ad-hoc Example

   Figure 6 illustrates how an ad-hoc conference can be created and
   managed in a conferencing system.

   A client can create a conference by establishing a call control
   signalling channel with a Conference Factory as specified in
   Section 5.2.  The Conference Factory can internally select one of the
   system supported Conference Object blueprints based on the requesting
   client privileges and the media lines included in the SDP body.

   The selected blueprint with its default values is copied by the
   server into a newly created Conference Object, referred to as an
   'Active Conference'.  At this point the Conference Object becomes
   independent from its blueprint.  A new Conference Object Identifier,
   a new Conference Identifier and a new focus are allocated by the
   server.

   During the conference lifetime, an authorized client can manipulate
   the Conference Object (such as adding participants) using the
   Conference Control Protocol [Section 7.3].

6.3  Advanced Example

   Figure 7 illustrates how a recurring conference can be specified
   according to system capabilities, scheduled, reserved, and managed in
   a conferencing system.

   Firstly, a client would query a Conferencing System for its
   capabilities.  This can be done by requesting a list of the
   Conference Object "blueprints" (or templates) the system supports.
   Each blueprint can contain a specific combination of capabilities and
   limitations of the conference server in terms of supported media
   types (audio, video, text, or combinations of these), participant
   roles, maximum number of participants of each role, availability of
   floor control, controls available for participants, availability and
   type of sidebars, the definitions and names of media streams, etc.

   A Client may need to query any templates that it doesn't understand
   and then make a decision on compatibility.  Interface hints need to
   be included as per [21].  The client then selects which specific



Barnes, et al.          Expires October 31, 2005               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   template to use  and retrieves the template from the server itself
   (and NOT from some centralized repository).

   The selected blueprint with its default values is copied by the
   client into a newly created Conference  Object, referred to as a
   'Conference Object for Reservation', that specifies the resources
   needed from the system for this Conference Instance.  At this point
   the 'Conference Object for Reservation' becomes independent from its
   blueprint.  The client can also change the default values (within the
   system ranges) and add additional information (such as the list of
   participants and the conference start time) to the 'Conference Object
   for Reservation'.

   At this point the client can ask the conference server to create a
   new conference reservation by attaching the 'Conference Object for
   Reservation' to the request.  As a result, the server can allocate
   the needed resources, create the additional Conference Objects for
   each conference occurrence (referred to as a 'Conference Object for
   Occurrence') and allocate the Conference Object identifiers for all -
   the 'Conference Object for Reservation'  and for each  'Conference
   Object for Occurrence'.

   From this point on, any authorized client is able to access and
   modify each of the Conference Objects independently.  By default,
   changes to an individual  'Conference Object for Occurrence' will
   affect neither the 'Conference Object for Reservation' nor its
   siblings.

   On the other hand, some of the conference sub-objects, such as the
   maximum number of participants and the participants list, can be
   defined by the system as parent-forcible.  As a result, these objects
   can be modified by accessing the 'Conference Object for Reservation'
   only.  The changes to these objects can be applied automatically to
   each of the 'Conference Object for Occurrence's (subject to local
   policy).

6.4  Scheduling a 'Conference Object for Reservation'

   Scheduling conferences forms an important part of the Conferencing
   System solution.  The concept of an individual Conference Instance



Barnes, et al.          Expires October 31, 2005               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   and its relationship to a specific Conference Object is introduced in
   Section 5.2.  A basic Conference Instance represents a single
   occurrence that has a specified 'start' and 'end' time, with the
   times being specified relative to a single specified 'fixed'  time
   (e.g. 'start' = 09.00 GMT, 'end'= 'start'+2), subject to system
   considerations .  In most advanced conferencing solutions it is
   possible to not only schedule an individual conference instance, but
   also schedule a series of related conferences (e.g.  A weekly meeting
   that starts on Thursday at 09.00 GMT).

   To be able to achieve such functionality, a Conferencing System needs
   to be able to appropriately schedule and maintain Conference
   Instances that form part of a recurring conference schedule.  The
   mechanism proposed in this document makes use of the 'Internet
   Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object' specification defined in
   RFC2445[8] in union with the concepts introduced in Section 4 for the
   purpose of achieving advanced conference scheduling capability.

   Figure 8 illustrates a simplified view of a Client interacting with a
   Conference System.  The Client is using the Conference Control
   Protocol (Section 7.3)  to add a new Conference Instance to the
   Conference System by interfacing with the Conference Control Server.
   A Conference Control Protocol request contains a valid 'Conference
   Object for Reservation' and reference by value to an 'iCal' object
   which contains scheduling information about the conference instance
   (e.g. start time, end time).

                       Figure 8: Resource Scheduling

   A successful creation of a Conference Instance using the Conference
   Control Protocol results in a new 'Conference Object for
   Reservation'.  A Conference Control Protocol request is validated,
   including the associated iCal object, and the resultant 'Conference
   Object for Reservation' is created.  The Conference Object is
   uniquely represented within the Conference System by Conference
   Object Identifier (e.g. xcon:hd87928374) as  discussed in
   Section 5.1.  The unique URI is returned to the client and can be
   used to reference the 'Conference Object for Reservation'

   representation if any future manipulations are required (e.g.  Alter
   start time) using a Conference Control Protocol.

   The previous example explains how a client creates a basic
   'Conference Object for Reservation' using an iCal reference in
   association with a Conference Control Protocol.  Figure 8 can also be
   applied when explaining how a series of Conferences are scheduled in
   the system.  The description is almost identical with the exception
   that the iCal definition that is included in a Conference Control
   Request represents a series of recurring Conference Instances (e.g.
   conference start time, end time, occur weekly).  The Conference
   system will treat this request the same as the first example.  The
   protocol request will be validated, along with the associated iCal
   object, and the 'Conference Object for Reservation' will be created.
   The 'Conference Object for Reservation' and the Conference Object ID
   created for this example represent the entire series of recurring
   Conference Instances rather than a single Conference.  If the client
   uses the Conference Object ID provided and a Conference Control
   Protocol to adjust the 'Conference Object for Reservation', every
   Conference Instance in the series will be altered, including all
   future occurrences.

   A Conferencing System that supports the scheduling of a series of
   Conference Instances should also be able to support manipulation
   within a series range.  A good example might be that a 'Conference
   Object for Reservation' has been scheduled to occur every Monday at
   09.00 GMT.  For the next three weeks only, the meeting has been
   altered to occur at 10.00 GMT  in an alternative venue.  With
   Figure 8 in mind, the  client will construct a Conference Control
   request whose purpose is to modify the existing 'Conference Object
   for Reservation' representing the recurring Conference Instance.  The
   Client will include the Conference Object ID provided by the
   Conference System to explicitly reference the 'Conference Object for
   Reservation' within the Conference System.  A Conference Control
   request will contain all the required changes to the 'Conference
   Object for Reservation'(e.g.  Change of venue).  The Conference
   System matches the incoming request to the existing 'Conference
   Object for Reservation' but identifies that the associated iCal
   object only refers to a range of the existing series.  The Conference
   System creates a child clone of the original 'Conference Object for
   Reservation'  to represent the altered Conference Instances within
   the Series.  The cloned 'Conference Object for Reservation'
   representing the altered series of Conference Instances has its own
   associated Conference Object ID which is returned to the Client using
   a Conference Control Protocol.  This Conference Object ID is then
   used by the client to make any future alterations on the newly
   defined sub-series.  This process can be repeated any number of times
   as the newly returned Conference Object ID representing an altered

   (cloned) series of Conference Instances, can itself be manipulated
   using the Conference Control Protocol and the newly created
   Conference Object ID representation.  This provides a flexible
   approach to the scheduling of recurring Conference instances.

7.  Conferencing Mechanisms

7.1  Call Control Signalling

   The focus is the central component of the conference.  Participants
   interface with the focus using an appropriate Call Control Signalling
   protocol.  Participants request to establish or join a conference
   using the Call control signalling interface.  A focus then either
   accepts (after checking the policies), sends a progress indication
   (e.g. for a parked call while awaiting moderator approval to join) or
   rejects that request using the call control signalling interface.

   During an active conference, a Conference Control Protocol
   [Section 7.3] can be used to affect the conference state.  For
   example, Conference Control Protocol requests to add and delete
   participants will be communicated to the focus and checked against
   the conference policies.  If approved, the participants will be added
   or deleted using the call signalling to/from the focus.

7.2  Notifications

   A Conferencing System is responsible for implementing a Conference
   Notification Service.  The Conference Notification Service provides
   updates about the Conference Instance state to authorized parties
   (e.g. participants) according to [11].

   The Conference User Identifier and associated Role are used by the
   conferencing system to filter the notifications such that they
   contain only information  that is allowed to be sent to that user.

7.3  Conference Control Protocols

   The XCON working group will develop a protocol or a set of protocols
   for controlling the state of a Conference Object and for retrieving
   its state.  The nature of this protocol is currently under discussion
   in the XCON working group.  The proposals span from data manipulation
   (management-like) protocols to semantic-oriented.  Several of the
   proposed protocols are detailed in the sections below.  Among other
   mentioned candidates are SOAP and HTML FORMS.  The following
   paragraphs summarize the fundamental issues around the selection of
   the protocol(s).  [Editor's Note: Discussion Point 5 on the XCON WG
   mailing list].




Barnes, et al.          Expires October 31, 2005               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   It is recognized that semantic manipulations make  for a cleaner
   protocol design, with the disadvantage that extensions to the
   underlying data model require extensions to the protocol used to
   manipulate it.  Syntactic manipulations allow for extensions to the
   data model without requiring protocol extensions, with the
   disadvantage that  the server generally has to infer intent from data
   manipulations instead  of having intent explicitly signaled.

   It is worth noting that one portion of the data to be manipulated,
   the Common Conference Information, will not be extended, and would
   naturally lend itself to semantic manipulation.  Another part of the
   data, the Conference Template, is intended to be extended, and would
   naturally lend itself to syntactic manipulation.  However, there has
   been a stated desire to use a single protocol (and presumably a
   single mode  of operation within this protocol) to manipulate all
   conference object state (common and template).

   The third statement in the paragraph above makes the first two
   solution options mutually exclusive; the XCON working group needs to
   determine which of the three statements above is least important to
   the working group.

7.3.1  CPCP

   A Conference Policy Control Protocol (CPCP) is a data manipulation
   protocol being proposed as a standard means of storing and
   manipulating the conference policy.  According to CPCP, the
   conference policy is comprised of the rules associated with a
   specific Conference Instance.  Requirements for the CPCP are defined
   in the CPCP Requirements document [13].  The Conference Policy
   Control Protocol document [17] defines the XML Schema for the
   conference policy data elements.

   The privileges as to which users are allowed to read and/or
   manipulate a specific Conference Instance are defined in a separate
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema[19].  This schema is based on
   the common policy model being used for geographic privacy information
   and for presence information.

   A separate document [18] proposes XCAP as one protocol mechanism for
   storing and manipulating this conferencing policy data.  XCAP is a
   HTTP 1.1 based protocol that allows clients to read, write, modify
   and delete application data stored in XML format on a server.  One of
   the main advantages of XCAP is that it maps XML document elements and
   attributes to HTTP URIs that can be directly accessed by HTTP.

7.3.2  CCCP

   A Centralized Conferencing Control Protocol [20] is a semantic-
   oriented protocol defined to allow participants or otherwise
   authorized entities to directly manipulate an active Conference
   Instance.  CCCP is defined as a set of transactions issued over a
   reliable transport protocol.  A transaction consists of a Request
   carrying the required information in an XML body and a corresponding
   Response carrying an appropriate XML body.

   CCCP requests are submitted to the CCCP server and can be prioritized
   and queued, based on the CCCP client Role and the requested
   primitives.  CCCP requires no single lock per document, and the CCCP
   server can locally implement an optimization strategy independent of
   CCCP client behavior.

7.3.3  CSCP

   A Conference State Change protocol [26] is a client server protocol
   used to change the state of a conference object.  CSCP extends the
   BFCP protocol [16] with new commands.  A client sends the server a
   request representing a sequence of commands.  Each command can set,
   get, add, or delete a single field in the conference object.  Changes
   to the conference object are performed on a hierarchal set of
   elements and unique attributes within those elements.  A series of
   changes can be pipelined in a single BFCP message.  The server
   executes each action in series.  If one of them fails, the server
   returns an error for the action that failed and does not execute any
   of the actions after that.  Each individual action is atomic but the
   pipelined series is not.

   The item to which a command applies  is specified by a unique ID and,
   where appropriate, attribute name.  The ID is an unsigned 32 bit
   integer called the Element ID.  The server discovery of  the Element
   ID  is outside of CSCP.  Typically this is done by using the
   conference  notification service per Section 7.2.  Each field in the
   data received in the notification contains a unique field ID
   attribute that can be used in BFCP requests.

7.3.4  NETCONF

   The Network Configuration (NETFCONF)  protocol [27] defines a simple
   mechanism through which a network device can be managed,
   configuration data information can be retrieved, and new
   configuration data can be uploaded and manipulated.  The protocol
   allows the device to expose a full, formal, application programming
   interface (API).

   NETCONF is proposed as the mechanism for object content manipulation
   and state retrieval for the XCON data.  NETCONF provides a flexible
   configuration retrieval mechanism, with extensibility.  It allows for
   incremental configuration and commits.  NETCONF supports stored
   configurations (e.g. for startup, running, etc.).  It also supports
   XPath and subtree filtering.  With NETCONF, there are no constraints
   on the configuration content.

7.4  Floor Control

   [Editor's Note: This text still requires further updating to reflect
   new model and pending new WG agreements.  Amongst the things TODO
   are:

   1.  Need to be able to fetch from the Conference Object the
   credentials required for BFCP.  This includes the conference id, user
   id, and password.

   4.  Evaluation of an alternative proposal [TBD as a stand alone draft
   as well] for using Templates as the means for correlating Floor
   Control identifiers.

   5.  Still need to condense this section - propose to add a scenario
   to section 8 and thus remove some of the details, leaving this
   description a very basic overview and mapping of the identifiers.

   ]

   A mechanism for floor control within a Conferencing System is defined
   in the 'Binary Floor Control Protocol' specification [16].  Floor
   control is not a mandatory mechanism for a Conferencing System
   implementation but provides advanced media input control features for
   participants.

   An XCON compliant client supporting floor control needs to obtain
   information for connecting to a floor control server to enable it to
   issue floor requests.  This connection information can be retrieved
   using information provided by mechanisms such as negotiation using
   the SDP[2] offer/answer[5] exchange on the signalling interface with
   the focus.

   As well as the Client --> Floor Server connection information, a
   client wishing to interact with a Floor Control server requires
   access to additional information.  This information associates Floor
   Control interactions with the appropriate Floor instance.  Once a
   connection has been established and authenticated (see [16] for
   authentication details), a specific floor control message requires
   detailed information to uniquely identify a user, a floor and a

   conference.  This information, defined in the next set of bullet
   points, can be obtained using methods such as negotiation using the
   SDP offer/answer exchange on the signalling interface with the focus:

   o  Conference Object ID - Each Conference Object has a unique
      identifier per Section 5.1,   obtained from the Conference server,
      which MUST be included in all Floor messages.  When the SDP model
      is used as described in [24] this identifier maps to the 'confid'
      SDP attribute.
   o  Conference User Identifier - Each user has a unique identifier
      within the Conference Object per Section 5.3, obtained from the
      Conference server,  which MUST be included in all Floor messages.
      When using SDP offer/answer exchange to negotiate a Floor control
      connection with the focus using the call control signalling
      interface, the unique conference identifier is contained in the
      'userid' SDP attribute, as defined in [24]
   o  Floor ID - A media session with a Conferencing System can have any
      number of 'Floors' (0 or more) that are represented by a unique
      identifier within the Conference Instance (as represented by
      Conference ID).  When using SDP offer/answer exchange to negotiate
      a Floor control connection with the focus using the call control
      signalling interface, the unique conference identifier is
      contained in the 'floorid' SDP attribute, as defined in [24]
      e.g.a=floorid:1 m-stream:10 .  Each 'floorid' attribute,
      representing a unique floor, has an 'm-stream' tag containing one
      or more identifiers.  The identifiers represent individual SDP
      media sessions (as defined using 'm=' from SDP) using the SDP
      'Label' attribute as defined in [23].

   Clients can authenticate a BFCP server using the TLS certificates.
   Requests submitted on a successfully created BFCP connection may
   additionally require digest authentication within the BFCP protocol
   to authenticate the Floor control client to the server.  For this to
   take place a shared secret needs to be exchanged between the BFCP
   client/server entities.  This can be achieved out of band using a
   mechanism such as the 'k=' SDP attribute.  The shared secret can also
   be exchanged using un-specified 'out of band' mechanisms.  When using
   Digest authentication of BFCP client messages the exchange of an
   active 'Nonce' is also required.  This can be achieved using a BFCP
   request response interaction as defined in BFCP (A request is
   submitted without a Nonce TLV and the server generates an error
   response with either an Error Code 7 (DIGEST TLV Required) or 6
   (Invalid Nonce) containing the valid nonce).  The BFCP 'Nonce' value
   can also be obtained 'out of band' using information provided in the
   Offer/Answer exchange.  As with the other SDP Floor attributes
   referenced in this section and defined in [24], the 'nonce' attribute
   can be inserted in the SIP response e.g. a=nonce:dhsa8hd0dwqj.

8.  Conferencing Scenario Realizations

   This section addresses how advanced conferencing scenarios, many of
   which have been described in  [14], are realized using this XCON
   framework.  The objective of this section  is to further illustrate
   the model, mechanisms and protocols presented in the previous
   sections and also serves to validate that the model, mechanisms and
   protocols are sufficient to support advanced conferencing scenarios.

   Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 provide examples of the creation of a
   basic adhoc conference and a more advanced scheduled conference.

8.1  Participant Manipulations

   There are different ways to affect a participant state in a
   conference.  A participant can join and leave the conference using
   call signalling means only, such as  SIP.  This kind of operation is
   called "1st party signalling" and does not affect the state of other
   participants in the conference.

   Limited operations for controlling other conference participants (a
   so called "3rd party control") through the Focus, using call
   signalling only, may also be available for some signalling protocols.
   For example, "Conferencing for SIP User Agents" [15] shows how SIP
   with REFER can be used to achieve this functionality.

   In order to perform richer conference control a user client needs to
   implement a conference control protocol client.  By using a
   conference control protocol, the client can affect its own state,
   state of other participants, and state of various resources (such as
   media mixers) which may indirectly affect the state of any of the
   conference participants.

   Figure 10  provides an example of one client "Alice"  impacting the
   state of another client "Bob".  This example assumes an established
   conference.  In this example, "Alice" wants to add "Bob" to the
   conference.

   It should be noted that not all entities impacted by the request are
   shown in the diagram (e.g.  Focus), but rather the emphasis is on the
   new entities introduced by XCON.

        "Bob"




         Figure 9: Client Manipulation of Conference - Add a party

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "add" a
   party ("Bob") in the specific conference as identified by the
   Conference Object ID, the Conference System ensures that "Alice" has
   the appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
   specific Conference Object to perform the operation.  The Conference
   System must also determine whether "Bob" is already a user of this
   Conference System or whether he is a new user.

   If "Bob" is a new user for this conference system, a Conference User
   Identifier is created for Bob. Based upon the addressing information
   provided for "Bob" by "Alice", the call signalling to add "Bob" to
   the conference is instigated through the Focus.

   Once the call signalling indicates that "Bob" has been successfully
   added to the specific conference, per updates to the state, and
   depending upon the policies, other participants (including "Bob") may
   be notified of the addition of "Bob" to the conference via the
   Conference Notification Service.

8.2  Media Manipulations

   There are different ways to manipulate the media in a conference.

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   A participant can change its own media streams by, for example,
   sending re-INVITE with new SDP content using SIP only.  This kind of
   operations is called "1st party signalling" and they do not affect
   the state of other participants in the conference.

   In order to perform richer conference control a user client needs to
   implement a conference control protocol client.  By using a
   conference control protocol, the client can manipulate the state of
   various resources, such as media mixers, which may indirectly affect
   the state of any of the conference participants.

   Figure 10  provides an example of one client "Alice"  impacting the
   media state of another client "Bob".  This example assumes an
   established conference.  In this example, the Client,  "Alice" whose
   Role is "moderator" of the conference,  wants to mute "Bob" on a
   medium-size multi-party conference,  as his device is not muted (and
   he's obviously not listening to the call)  and background noise in
   his office environment is disruptive to the conference.

   It should be noted that only entities impacted by the request are
   shown in the diagram (e.g. there is no Focus shown).

        Figure 10: Client Manipulation of Conference - Mute a party

   Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "mute" a
   party ("Bob") in the specific conference as identified by the
   Conference Object ID, the Conference Server ensures that "Alice" has
   the appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
   specific Conference Object to perform the operation.  "Bob's" status
   is marked as "recvonly" and the Conference Template of the Conference
   Object (if included) is updated to reflect that  "Bob's" media is not
   to be "mixed" with the conference media.

   Depending upon the policies, other participants (including "Bob") may
   be notified of this change via the Conference Notification Service.

8.3  Sidebar Manipulations

   A sidebar can be viewed as a separate Conference instance that only
   exits within the context of a parent Conference instance.  Although
   viewed as an independent Conference instance, it can not exist
   without a parent.  A Sidebar is created using the same mechanisms
   employed for a standard conference.  A Conference object representing
   a Sidebar is created using the mechanism defined in this document.
   Once created and instantiated with relevant information, a Conference
   System manages and enforces appropriate localized restrictions on the
   Sidebar Conference Object e.g.  No members from outside the parent
   conference instance can not join, Sidebar conference can not exist if
   parent Conference is terminated etc.  A Sidebar Conference Object is
   implicitly linked to the parent Conference Object.  The Sidebar
   mechanism uses the umbrella approach for association of XCON
   Conference Object Identifiers as introduced in other sections of this
   document.

   and associated Sidebar Conference Objects within a Conference System.
   Each Sidebar Conference Object has a unique Conference Object
   Identifier as described in Section 5.1.  The main Conference Object
   Identifier acts as a top level identifier for associated Sidebars.

   A sidebar Conference Object Identifier follows many of the concepts
   outlined in the Cloning tree model described in Section 6.1.  A
   Sidebar Conference Object contains a subset of members from the
   original Conference object.  Properties of the Sidebar Conference
   Object can be manipulated by a Conference Control Protocol
   (Section 7.3 using the unique Conference Object identifier for the
   sidebar.  It is also possible for the top level Conference Object to
   enforce policy on the Sidebar Object (similar to parent enforceable
   as discussed in Section 6.1).

9.  Relationships between SIPPING and XCON Frameworks

   The SIPPING Conferencing Framework [9] provides an overview of a wide
   range of centralized conferencing solutions known today in the
   conferencing industry.  The document introduces a terminology and
   logical entities in order to systemize the overview and to show the
   common core of many of these systems.  The logical entities and the
   listed scenarios in the SIPPING Conferencing Framework are being used
   to illustrate how SIP [4] can be used as a signalling means in these
   conferencing systems.  SIPPING Conferencing Framework does not define
   new conference control protocols to be used by the general
   conferencing system.  It uses only basic SIP [4], the SIP
   Conferencing for User Agents [15], and  the SIPPING Conference
   Package [9] for basic SIP conferencing realization.

   The XCON framework defines a particular centralized Conferencing
   System and the logical entities implementing it.  It also defines a
   particular XCON Data Model and refers to the standard protocols
   (beyond call signalling means) being defined by the XCON WG to be
   used among the XCON logical entities for implementing advanced
   conferencing features.  The purpose of XCON working group and this
   framework is to achieve interoperability between the XCON entities
   from different vendors for controlling different aspects of advanced
   conferencing applications.

   The logical entities defined in the two frameworks are not intended
   to be mapped one-to-one.  The two frameworks differ in the
   interpretation of the internal conferencing system decomposition and
   the corresponding operations.  Nevertheless, the basic SIP [4], the
   SIP Conferencing for User Agents [15], and the SIPPING Conference
   Package [9] are fully compatible with both Framework documents.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a wide variety of potential attacks related to
   conferencing, due to the natural involvement of multiple endpoints
   and the many, often user-invoked, capabilities provided by the
   conferencing system.  Examples of attacks include the following: an
   endpoint attempting  to listen to conferences in which  it  is not
   authorized to participate, an endpoint attempting to disconnect or
   mute other users, and theft of service, by an endpoint, in attempting
   to create conferences it is not allowed to create.

   There are several issues surrounding security of this conferencing
   framework.  One set of issues involves securing the actual protocols
   and the associated authorization mechanisms.  This first set of
   issues should  be addressed in the specificiations specific to the
   protocols described in Section 7.  The protocols used for



Barnes, et al.          Expires October 31, 2005               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft               XCON Framework                   April 2005


   manipulation and retrieval of confidential information MUST support a
   confidentiality and integrity mechanism.  Similar requirements apply
   for the floor control protocols.

   There are also security issues associated with the authorization to
   perform actions on the conferencing system to invoke specific
   capabilities.  Section 4.3 discusses the policies associated with the
   Conference Object to ensure that only authorized entities are able to
   manipulate the data to access the capabilities.  The final set of
   issues involves the privacy and security of the identity of a user in
   the conference.

   Many policy authorization decisions are based on the identity of the
   user or the Role that a user may have.  There are several ways that a
   user might authenticate its identity to the system.  The conferencing
   system may know about specific users and assign passwords to the
   users.  The users may also be authenticated by knowing a particular
   Conference ID and a PIN for it.  Sometimes, a PIN is not required and
   the Conference ID is used as a shared secret.  The call signalling
   means can provide a trusted form of the user identity or it might
   just provide a hint of the possible identity and the user still needs
   to provide some authentication to prove it has the identity that was
   provided as a hint in the call signalling.  This may be in the form
   of an IVR system or other means.  The goal for the Conferencing
   System is to figure out a user identity and a Role for any attempt to
   send a  request to the Conferencing System.

   When a Conferencing System presents the identity of authorized users,
   it may choose to provide information about the way the identity was
   proven to or verified by  the system.  A user may also come as a
   completely unauthenticated user into the system - this fact needs
   also be communicated to interested parties.

   When guest users interact with the system, it is often in the context
   of a particular conference.  In this case the user may provide a PIN
   or a password that is specific to the conferences and authenticates
   the user to take on a certain role in that conference.  The guest
   user can then perform actions that are allowed to any user with that
   Role.

   The term password is used to mean the usual, that is to say a
   reasonable sized, in number of bits, hard to predict shared secret.
   Today users often have passwords with more than 30 bits of randomness
   in them.  PIN is a special password case - a shared secret that is
   only numeric and often contains a fairly small number of bits (often
   as few as 10 bits).  When Conferencing Systems are used for audio on
   the PSTN, there is often a need to authenticate using a PIN.
   Typically if the user fails to provide the correct PIN a few times in

   a row, the PSTN call is disconnected.  The rate of making the calls
   and getting to the point to enter a PIN makes is fairly hard to do an
   exhaustive search of the PIN space even for 4 digit PINs.  When using
   a high speed interface to connect to a Conferencing System, it is
   often possible to do thousands of attempts per second and the PIN
   space could quickly be searched.  Because of this, it is not
   appropriate to use PINs for authorization on any of the interfaces
   that provide fast queries or many simultaneous queries.

   This conferencing system has an idea of the identity of a user but
   this does not mean it can reveal this identity to other users, due to
   privacy considerations.  Users can set select various options for
   revealing their identity to other users.  A user can be "hidden" such
   that other users can not see they are involved in the conference, or
   they can be "anonymous" such that users can see that another user is
   there,  but not see the identity of the user, or they can be "public"
   where other users can see their identity.  If there are multiple
   "anonymous" users, other parties will be able to see them as
   independent "anonymous" parties and will be able to tell how many
   "anonymous" parties are in the conference.  Note, that the visibility
   to other participants is dependent on their Roles.  For example,
   users' visibility (including "anonymous" and "hidden") may be
   displayed to the moderator or administrator, subject to a
   Conferencing System's local policies.  "Hidden" status is often used
   by robot participants of a conference and is also used in many call
   center conference situations.

   2.  DP5.  CCP Protocol.

14.  Changes since last Version

   Changes from individual 02 to WG 00:

   - few minor editorial changes

   -  Section 2.  Removed second sentence of definition of Conference
   ID, as that's now included/described in context in new Identifier
   section.

   - Section 3.  Clarified that TBD in Figure 1 is "Conference Control
   Protocol" (per Keith's comment to be more explicit).

   - Section 4.1.  Identifiers.  Moved this to a new section (
   Section 5).

   - New section for Identifiers  ( Section 5), thus all section
   references beyond 4 are incremented in the new version.

   - Section 4.  Since section 4.1 was removed, section 4.2 became the
   body text for section 4.

   - Section 4.2.  Added "Floor Information" to Figure 2 as part of
   Common Conference Information, also added "Floor Control" to
   Conference Template (per text and Cullen's draft).

   - Section 4.5.  Conference policies.  Reworded to not introduce new
   terms, but use the general terms identified in the 1st paragraph.

   - Section 5.2.  Removed "Instance" from "Active Conference Instance"
   in Figure 4.

   - Section 5.3.  Added text clarifying that templates are retrieved
   from server (not central repository) (per DP3 conclusion).

   - Section 5.4.  Added text that there is a single time and that the
   times are all relative the one time (per DP1 conclusion).

   - Section 5.4.  Added text clarifying that changes to a series impact
   "all future occurrences (per DP1 discussion/conclusion).

   - Section 6.3 - Added subsections for discussion of CSCP and NETCONF
   as the CCP.

   -  Section 6.4 - Floor Control.  Removed Editor's notes 2 and 3.
   Condensed the text only slightly, but added explicit references to

   new identifier section.

   - Section 6.4.1 Moved to new Identifier section  ( Section 5)

   - Section 7.1 - moved example to 7.2.  Included a new (more
   appropriate example) in 7.1, although this may be too basic.
