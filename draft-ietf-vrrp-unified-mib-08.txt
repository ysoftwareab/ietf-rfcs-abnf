Abstract 
    
   This specification defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for 
   use with SNMP-based network management.  In particular, it defines 
   objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that 
   employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 for both IPv4 
   and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798. This memo obsoletes RFC 2787.

   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
2.   Introduction 
    
   This specification defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for 
   use with SNMP-based network management.  In particular, it defines 
   objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that 
   employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 for both IPv4 
   and IPv6 (IPvX) as defined in RFC 5798 [RFC5798]. 
 
3.   Terminology 
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   The term "IPvX" (where X is 4 or 6) is introduced to mean either  
   "IPv4" or "IPv6". 
    
4.   Relationship to RFC 2787 
    
   This document will obsolate RFC2787 [RFC2787]. 
    
5.   Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB) 
    
   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more 
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in 
   the VRRP MIB. This MIB module imports ifIndex from the IF-MIB. At 
   this time, the latest version of IF-MIB is from RFC2863 [RFC2863]. 
    
6.   Multi-Stack Implementations 
    
   This MIB is designed to support Multi-Stack implementations that run 
   VRRP over IPvX. IP version, VRID and ifIndex are used to uniquely 
   identify rows in a multi stack implementation.

7.   VRRP MIB Structure and Design 
 
   Tables in the MIB include the following: 
   (1)  The vrrpv3OperationsTable, which contains objects that define 
        the operational characteristics of a VRRP router.  Rows in this 
        table correspond to instances of virtual routers. 
   (2)  The vrrpv3StatisticsTable which contains the operating 
        statistics for a VRRP router. 
   (3)  The vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable, contains the addresses of the  
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up. 
    
   Tables are indexed on ifIndex, VRID and the IP version to uniquely 
   identify a VRRP router. 
 
 
 
8.   VRRP Multistack Scenario 
    
   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in 
   this MIB are instantiated. 
    
    
   KEY: 
   ---- 
    
   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the 
   actual MIB objects as follows: 
    
   if      = IfIndex 
   AddrType= vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType 
   VrId    = vrrpv3OperationsVrId 
   State   = vrrpv3OperStatus 
   Prior   = vrrpOpeartionsPriority 
   IpAddr  = vrrpv3OperationsMasterIpAddr 
    
   The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP 
   routers VR1 & VR2, configured with two virtual routers.  Addresses in 
   '()' indicate the address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 
   to H4 are IPv4 hosts and H5 to H8 are IPv6 hosts. A, B and C are IPv4 
   addresses and X, Y and Z are IPv6 addresses. In the diagram, 
   "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB.

   NOTES: 
    
   1)  For "State": M = Master;   B = Backup. 
   In the vrrpv3OperationsTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that the 
   respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address is 
   native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner").

               results in administratively bringing down the row. 
    
               Destroying the entry or setting it to destroy(6)  
               removes the associated address from the virtual router. 
               The use of other values is implementation-dependent.

10.    Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   The objects vrrpv3OperationsPriority, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr, 
   vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval, vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode, 
   vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode, vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus and 
   vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus possess the read-create attribute.  
   Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation 
   of a virtual router. 
    
   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to: 
    
   o The vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus object which could be used to disable 
   a virtual router. While there are other columns that, if changed,  
   could disrupt operations, they can not be changed without first  
   changing the RowStatus object. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the  
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features

Internet Draft             VRRP unified MIB                  June 2010 
 
 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
 
 
 
11.    IANA Considerations 
    
      The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned  
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:  
        
           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value  
           ----------        -----------------------  
        
           vrrpv3MIB           { mib-2 ZZZ }  
        
      [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is  
      requested to assign a value for "ZZZ" under the 'mib-2' subtree  
      and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When  
      the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace  
      "ZZZ" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to 
      remove this note.]
