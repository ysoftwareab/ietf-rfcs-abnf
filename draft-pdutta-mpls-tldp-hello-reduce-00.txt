Abstract 

   Targeted LDP Hellos are used for establishing adjacencies with non-
   directly connected peers. After an LDP session is established to a 
   targeted peer, the session Keepalives are sufficient to notify the 
   intent of an LSR to maintain its adjacency with the peer. This 
   document proposes a mechanism to turn off Targeted LDP Hellos after 
   LDP session is established to a peer.

1. Introduction 

   LDP Hello messages are exchanged as part of the LDP discovery 
   mechanism [RFC5036]. There are two types of LDP discovery mechanism 
   described in [RFC5036] - Basic Discovery and Extended Discovery.  

   To engage in LDP Basic Discovery on an interface, an LSR periodically 
   sends LDP Link Hellos out the interface to the well-known LDP 
   discovery port for the "all routers on this subnet" group multicast 
   address. Receipt of an LDP Link Hello on an interface, identifies a 
   hello adjacency with a potential LDP peer reachable at the link level 
   on the interface. Thus an LSR may establish hello adjacency with 
   multiple peers discovered over a single interface and must continue 
   to transmit hellos at regular intervals even after hello adjacency is 
   established to a peer. 

   Extended discovery is used to support LDP sessions between non-
   directly connected LSRs. An LDP Targeted Hello is sent to a specific 
   address rather than to the "all routers" group multicast address for 
   the ongoing interface. Receipt of a LDP Targeted Hello indentifies a 
   hello adjacency with a potential LDP peer at network level. 

   In Extended discovery there can be only one Targeted Hello Adjacency 
   between two peers. Note that throughout this document "peer" means 
   the LDP LSR designated by a unique LDP Identifier. Once the LDP 
   session is operational between two targeted LDP peers, periodic 
   session Keepalives are used to maintain the LDP session. After the 
   session is operational the periodic Targeted Hellos between the LSRs 
   become redundant, as session Keepalives in turn serves the intent of 
   each LSR to maintain its adjacency to its peer. When an LSR maintains 
   a large number of LDP sessions (in thousands) to targeted peers, it

   is an additional burden to send and receive Targeted Hellos for all 
   peers at periodic intervals. 

   This document proposes an optional mechanism to turn off Targeted LDP 
   Hellos after a LDP session is established to a targeted peer.  

2. Conventions used in this document 

   INFO (REMOVE): INCLUDE THIS SECTION OR PORTIONS THEREOF IF DESIRED 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Terminology 

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3031] and 
   [RFC5036]. 

4. Targeted LDP Hello Reduction Procedure 

   The Targeted LDP Hello Reduction procedure uses the existing Common 
   Hello Parameters TLV defined in [RFC5036]. Figure 1. shows the 
   encoding of the TLV from [RFC5036] for reference.

                Figure 1. Common Hello Parameters TLV. 

    By definition in [RFC5036], a value of 0 means use the default,  
    which is 45 seconds for Targeted Hellos.  A value of 0xffff means 
    infinite.

    The procedure to be followed for Targeted LDP Hello Reduction    
    between a pair of LSRs is as follows: 

   1. An LSR starts transmitting periodic targeted hellos to its peer in 
      order to establish the targeted hello adjacency. Each LSR proposes 
      its configured hello hold time in the Common Hello Parameters TLV 
      in its hello message to the peer. The hold time used between a 
      pair of LSRs is the minimum of the hold times proposed in their 
      Hellos. 

   2. If the Hello is acceptable by receiving LSR it establishes 
      targeted hello adjacency with the source LSR. Establishment of 
      Hello adjacency establishes the LDP session between peering LSRs.  

   3. After the LDP session is ESTABLISHED [RFC5036], each LSR SHOULD 
      advertise hello holdtime value of 0xffff in the Common Hello 
      Parameters TLV. Thus after the session is ESTABLISHED, the hello 
      hold time between the LSRs gets negotiated to infinite. An LSR MAY 
      implement a locally configurable "tolerance" - the number of 
      Targeted LDP Hellos to be advertised with infinite hold time after 
      the LDP session is ESTABLISHED. 

   4. If the LDP session between two LSRs fails leading to tearing down 
      of adjacency, then each LSR reverts to advertising their 
      configured hello hold time and repeats procedure 1 to 3. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that each peering LSR implements the Targeted LDP 
   Hello Reduction procedure; otherwise negotiated hello hold time 
   between the LSRs does not fall back to the infinite hold time in step 
   3.  

5. Security Considerations 

   - Control plane aspects    
      - LDP security (authentication) methods as described in [RFC5036]  
        is applicable here.  
 
   - Data plane aspects 
      - This specification does not have any impact on the MPLS 
        forwarding plane setup by LDP. 
 
6. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not require any IANA consideration.

7. Conclusion 

   The method proposed in the document reduces significant burden on an 
   LDP LSR that maintains Targeted LDP sessions to a large number (in 
   thousands) of peers. Further, if BFD [BFD][BFD-MHOP] is used for 
   tracking connectivity to peers it is desirable to turn off Targeted 
   LDP hellos after the LDP session is setup.
