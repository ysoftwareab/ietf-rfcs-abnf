1.  Introduction

   In-situ OAM (IOAM) records OAM information within the packet while
   the packet traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in-situ"
   refers to the fact that the IOAM data fields are added to the data
   packets rather than being sent within packets specifically dedicated
   to OAM.  This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported
   as part of the VXLAN-GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] encapsulation.
   The IOAM data fields are defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  An
   implementation of IOAM which leverages VXLAN-GPE to carry the IOAM
   data is available from the FD.io open source software project
   [FD.io].

3.  IOAM Data Field Encapsulation in VXLAN-GPE

   VXLAN-GPE is defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].  IOAM data fields
   are carried in VXLAN-GPE using a next protocol value of TBD_IOAM.  An
   IOAM header is added containing the different IOAM data fields
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  In an administrative domain
   where IOAM is used, insertion of the IOAM header in VXLAN-GPE is
   enabled at the VXLAN-GPE tunnel endpoints, which also serve as IOAM
   encapsulating/decapsulating nodes by means of configuration.

              Figure 1: IOAM data encapsulation in VXLAN-GPE

   The VXLAN-GPE header and fields are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].  The VXLAN Next Protocol value for IOAM is
   TBD_IOAM.

   The IOAM related fields in VXLAN-GPE are defined as follows:

   IOAM-Type:  8-bit field defining the IOAM Option type, as defined in
      Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM HDR len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IOAM HDR in
      4-octet units not including the first 4 octects.

   Reserved:  8-bit reserved field MUST be set to zero upon transmission
      and ignored upon receipt.

   Next Protocol:  8-bit unsigned integer that determines the type of
      header following IOAM protocol.  The value is from the IANA

      registry setup for VXLAN GPE Next Protocol defined in
      [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe].

   IOAM Option and Data Space:  IOAM option header and data is present
      as specified by the IOAM-Type field, and is defined in Section 4
      of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Multiple IOAM options MAY be included within the VXLAN-GPE
   encapsulation.  For example, if a VXLAN-GPE encapsulation contains
   two IOAM options before a data payload, the Next Protocol field of
   the first IOAM option will contain the value of TBD_IOAM, while the
   Next Protocol field of the second IOAM option will contain the VXLAN
   "Next Protocol" number indicating the type of the data payload.

4.  Considerations

   This section summarizes a set of considerations on the overall
   approach taken for IOAM data encapsulation in VXLAN-GPE, as well as
   deployment considerations.

4.1.  Discussion of the encapsulation approach

   This section is to support the working group discussion in selecting
   the most appropriate approach for encapsulating IOAM data fields in
   VXLAN-GPE.

   An encapsulation of IOAM data fields in VXLAN-GPE should be friendly
   to an implementation in both hardware as well as software forwarders.
   Hardware forwarders benefit from an encapsulation that minimizes
   iterative look-ups of fields within the packet: Any operation which
   looks up the value of a field within the packet, based on which
   another lookup is performed, consumes additional gates and time in an
   implementation - both of which are desired to be kept to a minimum.
   This means that flat TLV structures are to be preferred over nested
   TLV structures.  IOAM data fields are grouped into three option
   categories: Trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge.  Each of these
   three options defines a TLV structure.  A hardware-friendly
   encapsulation approach avoids grouping these three option categories
   into yet another TLV structure, but would rather carry the options as
   a serial sequence.

   Two approaches for encapsulating IOAM data fields in VXLAN-GPE could
   be considered:

   1.  Use a single GPE protocol type for all IOAM types: IOAM would
       receive a single GPE protocol type code point.  A "sub-type"
       field would then specify what IOAM options type (trace, proof-of-
       transit, edge-to-edge) is carried.

Internet-Draft     In-situ OAM VXLAN-GPE encapsulation         July 2019


   2.  Use one GPE protocol type per IOAM options type: Each IOAM data
       field option (trace, proof-of-transit, and edge-to-edge) would be
       specified by its own "next protocol", i.e. each IOAM options type
       becomes its own GPE protocol type with a dedicated code point.
       This implies that in case additional IOAM option types would be
       added in the future, additional GPE protocol type code points
       would need to be allocated.

   The first option has been chosen here.  Multiple back-to-back IOAM
   options can be encoded as a succession of IOAM headers, with the same
   single GPE protocol type appearing as the next protocol before each
   IOAM header, but different sub-types within each IOAM header.

4.2.  IOAM and the use of the VXLAN O-bit

   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] defines an "O bit" for OAM packets.  Per
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] the O bit indicates that the packet
   contains an OAM message instead of data payload.  Packets that carry
   IOAM data fields in addition to regular data payload / customer
   traffic must not set the O bit.  Packets that carry only IOAM data
   fields without any payload must set the O bit.

4.3.  Transit devices

   If IOAM is deployed in domains where UDP port numbers are not
   controlled and do not have a domain-wide meaning, such as on the
   global Internet, transit devices MUST NOT attempt to modify the IOAM
   data contained in the IOAM header following the VXLAN-GPE header.  In
   case UDP port numbers are not controlled there might be UDP packets
   specifying the same UDP port number that VXLAN-GPE utilizes, i.e.
   4790, but with a payload that is not VXLAN-GPE.  The scenario and
   associated reasoning is discussed in [RFC7605] which states that "it
   is important to recognize that any interpretation of port numbers --
   except at the endpoints -- may be incorrect, because port numbers are
   meaningful only at the endpoints."

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a protocol number for the following
   VXLAN-GPE "Next Protocols" related to IOAM:

                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | Next Protocol | Description | Reference     |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+
                 | x             | TBD_IOAM    | This document |
                 +---------------+-------------+---------------+

Internet-Draft     In-situ OAM VXLAN-GPE encapsulation         July 2019


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of VXLAN-GPE are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe], and the security considerations of IOAM in
   general are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM is considered a "per domain" feature, where one or several
   operators decide on leveraging and configuring IOAM according to
   their needs.  Still, operators need to properly secure the IOAM
   domain to avoid malicious configuration and use, which could include
   injecting malicious IOAM packets into a domain.
