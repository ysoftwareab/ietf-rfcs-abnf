1.  Introduction

   This document defines a mechanism called "RPKI validated cache Update
   in SLURM [RFC 8416] over HTTPs (RUSH)", for the use of SLURM in
   updating RPKI cache data over HTTP [RFC7540] using HTTPs [RFC2818]
   URIs (and therefore TLS [RFC8446] security for integrity and
   confidentiality).  Integration with HTTP provides a secure transport
   for distributing cache data, which is in alignment with SLURM file
   format in order to take advantage of using one same API for a cache
   server to do both remote update and local override.

   The RPKI validated cache in this document refers to the validated
   data of assertion information certified by corresponding RPKI signed
   objects such as ROA [RFC6482] and BGPsec router certificate
   [RFC8209], which are transferred from the RPKI cache server to
   routers by RTR protocol [RFC8210] for the use of the RPKI.  While
   this document is intended for the RPKI cache update between two cache
   servers.  SLURM offers a standardized method for describing RPKI
   cache data in JSON format [RFC8259], and SLURM is designed to carry
   out incremental update.

   The primary use of RUSH is to distribute RPKI validated cache within
   an ISP or an ICP composed of a number of ASes.  A small site or
   enterprise network MAY also use RUSH by synchronizing with a third-
   party RPKI cache provider over networks.

   Note that RUSH merely focuses on a standardized transport and data
   format of the RPKI cache data.  RUSH has nothing to do with
   synchronization at the RUSH end system, that is, more sophisticated
   functions such as automatic re-synchronization and access control is
   out of this scope and MAY be left to private implementation.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT","REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  RUSH Operations

3.1.  Use of SLURM

   RUSH uses SLURM file format to indicate the intended update.  A SLURM
   file consists of a single JSON object containing some members.  Among
   others, "validationOutputFilters" [Section 3.3 of [RFC8416]] and
   "locallyAddedAssertions" [Section 3.4 of [RFC8416]] are defined to
   describe actions of deleting some of existing data items and adding
   new data items respectively.

   Note that RUSH re-uses the JSON members of SLURM object, not implying
   the very actions are taken locally to any extent.  Typically, RUSH
   takes place over networks remotely while take effects to the cache in
   question locally.

   The RUSH-aware HTTP server/client MUST be prepared to parse SLURM
   object.

3.2.  Use of HTTP as Transport

   HTTP is employed by RUSH to transfer RPKI validated cache update
   information as expressed as a SLURM object.  A new data type is
   therefore defined to identify SLURM object in HTTP message body.

   The RUSH-aware HTTP server/client MUST be prepared to process media
   type "application/json-slurm".

3.3.  RUSH Example

   Figure 1 shows an example of using RUSH to carry out RPKI validated
   cache by HTTP POST method.


  POST /rpki-cache HTTP/2
  Host: rpki.example.com
  Content-Type : application/json-slurm
  Content-Length:964
  <964 bytes represented by the following json string>
  {

5.  Security Considerations

   Updating RPKI validated cache over HTTPs relies on the security of
   the underlying HTTP transport.  Implementations utilizing HTTP/2
   benefit from the TLS profile defined in Section 9.2 of [RFC7540].  An
   HTTPS connection provides transport security for the interaction
   between servers, but it does not provide data integrity detection.
   An adversary that can control the cache used by the subscriber can
   affect that subscriber's view of the RPKI.  The RPKI cache server
   security and the trust model for the interaction between cache server
   and subscriber is out of the scope of this document.
