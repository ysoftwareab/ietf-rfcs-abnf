Abstract 

   This document defines additional civic address parameters for use in 
   Location Objects [1], [2], and [4].  The format is based on the civic 
   address definition of PIDF-LO.  These addition parameters allow 
   expression of administrative specific location data elements.

1. Introduction 

   In large enterprise/campus networks, information about a host's 
   network/campus location is often useful for internal application 
   configuration and maintenance of both applications and network 
   infrastructure.  Typically, this is information that is not useful 
   outside of the campus or enterprise.  Currently, this information is 
   collected via additional data collection mechanisms such as SNMP or 
   link layer protocols.

   The information included within this locally significant data set 
   includes elements like access point identifier, switch port 
   identifier, administrative domain identifier, etc.  Although these 
   attributes are not normally associated with publicly known civic 
   locations advertised outside the enterprise, they are none the less 
   very important to the configuration, administration and maintenance 
   of campus networks/applications.  These elements are considered 
   'location' within the domain of enterprise application and 
   infrastructure administration.   

   Although PIDF-LO civic location currently supports additional 
   elements such as CAtypes 28 (room), 32 (additional code), or 33 
   (seat), the use of already defined fields for internal purposes is 
   problematic as there may be conflicts in the future. Therefore, there 
   is the need to identify a range of elements that network/application 
   administrators can use for their own local purposes. 

   Since these additional CAtypes are designated for internal 
   administrative usage and have no value outside the administrative 
   domain, the additional CAtypes defined here SHOULD be deleted from 
   any location object (LO) prior to the LO being distributed outside 
   the respective administrative domain. 

   Additions to PIDF-LO 

   PIDF-LO, as updated by [2], includes a full set of parameters used to 
   describe civic locations.  The new parameters defined here are 
   additions to the updated set. Such additions provide a means to 
   describe a host's location with additional local administrative 
   significance. 

    

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

3. Administrative Specific Location 

   Administrative Specific Location elements are defined by first 
   identifying the Administrative domain via a new CAType. The CAtype 
   200 is recommended for this purpose. It is then suggested that the 
   CAtype 201 to 225 be reserved for the Administrative domain specified 
   information.

5. Security Considerations 

   The XML parameters defined in the document are additions to the 
   current PIDF-LO specification.  Therefore the parameters defined here 
   are subject to the same security considerations of [1]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

6.1. XML Schema Registration 

   IANA will update the registered XML schema with additions as shown in 
   section 4 of this document.

6.2. CAType Registry Update 

   IANA will update the civic address type registry established by 
   RFC4776.  The additions to the registry are shown in Table 1 of the 
   document.
