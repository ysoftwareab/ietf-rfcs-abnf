1.  Introduction

   ONS [10] is a network service that leverages Domain Name System (DNS)
   to discover information about a product and related services from the
   Electronic Product Code (EPC).  The most common example is where ONS
   is used to discover an EPCIS [11] service that contains product data
   from a manufacturer for a given EPC.  ONS may also be used to
   discover an EPCIS service that has master data pertaining to a
   particular EPCIS location identifier (this use case is not yet fully
   addressed in the ONS specification [10]).

   EPCIS Discovery Service (EPCIS DS) [11] refers to a mechanism, not
   yet defined by EPCglobal, for locating all EPCIS-enabled Repositories
   that might have data about a particular EPC.  This is useful when the
   relevant EPCIS services might not otherwise be known to the party who
   wishes to query them, such as when the handling history of an object
   is desired but not known (e.g. in support of track-and-trace across a
   multi-party supply chain).  The volumes of serial-level records
   generated by the supply chains would place an unreasonable burden on
   the DNS roots if ONS were used as EPCIS DS for holding ONS records
   for each serial number.

   ESDS [12][13][14][15] is an application layer protocol for the
   distributed sharing and discovery of notification events between
   associated partners within a supply chain.  To avoid traffic flat and
   walking up the Internet root hierarchy, ESDS might use peer-to-peer
   lookup protocols (such as JXTA [16]) as an alternative to
   hierarchical lookup protocols such as DNS and ONS.  So unlike DNS or
   ONS, where there is a known set of root servers, ESDS will have
   numerous roots for various supply chains operating globally.  ONS can
   be used in collaboration with ESDS to make the multiple ESDS roots be
   found easily.

   Since ONS contains pointers to services, a simple A record (or IP
   address) is insufficient for today's more advanced web services based
   systems.  Therefore ONS uses the Naming Authority PoinTeR (NAPTR) DNS
   record type [3].  This record type contains several fields for
   denoting the protocol, services and features that a given service
   endpoint exposes.  It also allows the service end point to be
   expressed as a URI, thus allowing complex services to be encoded in a
   standard way.This document is intended to define a new NAPTR service
   type of ONS for ESDS.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

Internet-Draft                 ESDS naptr                       Oct 2008


   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [4].


3.  The Relationship Between The ESDS and ONS

   As set forth, it is expected that there will be multiple
   competitively ESDS roots and that some of them will have limited
   scope (regional, facility wide, etc).  So different product may be in
   the domain of different ESDS root.  It is necessary for the inquirer
   to get the address of the ESDS root in advance.

   ONS provide pointers to authoritative information about an EPC.  ONS
   may also be used to discover an ESDS root that has correlative data
   pertaining to a particular EPC.

   The relationship between the ESDS and ONS is shown in Figure 1.

   Figure 1

   Each ESDS root can store its address information into the ONS, and
   the ONS can provide pointers to each ESDS root for the inquirer.


4.  The Working Flow of The Query For ESDS

   The working flow of the query for ESDS is given as follows.

   Figure 2

   The inquirer needs to query the ONS for the address of the ESDS
   before making query to the ESDS.


5.  The NAPTR Service Type of ONS For ESDS

   The use of NAPTR records is governed by a series of RFCs that define
   something called the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service
   [5][6][7][8][9].  In order to safely use NAPTR records on the public
   network a specification must exist that describes the values of the
   various fields.  As defined in [10], Figure 3 is a template covering
   information needed for the registration of the NAPTR service type of
   ONS for ESDS specified in this document.


       +-------+-------+-------+-----------+------------+-------------+
       | Order | Pref  | Flags | Service   | Regexp     | Replacement |
       +-------+-------+-------+-----------+------------+-------------+
       | 0     | value | u     | ESDS+name | !^.*$!URI! | .           |
       +-------+-------+-------+-----------+------------+-------------+

   Figure 3

   o  Order: The Order field SHALL be zero.
   o  Pref: The Pref field SHALL be a non-negative integer.The value of
      the Pref field is an ordinal 438 that specifies that the service
      in one record is preferred to the service in another record having
      the same Service field.  An ONS Client SHOULD use attempt to use a

      service having a lower Pref number before using an equivalent
      service having a higher Pref number.
   o  Flags: The Flags field SHALL be set to 'u', indicating that the
      Regexp field contains a URI.
   o  Service: The Service field contains an indicator of the type of
      service that can be found at the URI in question.  The value of
      the Service field SHALL consist of the string ESDS+ followed by
      the name of a ESDS service.  The Service field identifies what
      type of service is accessible through the URI provided by the
      Regexp field of this record.  See Section "4.  The Service
      Registration of ONS For ESDS" for examples of service types.
   o  Regexp: The Regexp field specifies a URI for the service being
      described.  The value of this field SHALL be the string !^.*$!
      (the six character sequence consisting of an exclamation point, a
      caret, a period, an asterisk, a dollar sign, and another
      exclamation point), followed by a URI, followed by an exclamation
      point (!) character.
   o  Replacement: The Replacement field is set to a single period
      ('.').


6.  The Service Registration of ONS For ESDS

   As defined in [10], the following is a template covering information
   needed for the registration of the ONS service specified in this
   document.

   o  Service Name: "ESDS+html"
   o  Functional Specification: Simply returns a URI that will resolve
      to an HTML page on some server.
   o  Valid URI schemes: http, https, ftp
   o  Security considerations: None not already inherent in the use of
      the WorldWideWeb.

   o  Service Name: "ESDS+xmlrpc"
   o  Functional Specification: A URI that denotes an HTTP POST capable
      service on some server that is expecting XML-RPC [17] compliant
      connection.
   o  Valid URI schemes: http, https
   o  Security considerations: None not already inherent in the use of
      the WorldWideWeb.

   o  Service Name: "ESDS+ws"
   o  Functional Specification: A generic Web Services [18] based
      service where the application must negotiate what services are
      available by investigating the WSDL file found at the URI in the
      Regexp.

   o  Valid URI schemes: http, https
   o  Security considerations: Web Services utilize a great deal of
      existing Internet infrastructure and protocols.  It is very easy
      to use some of them in insecure ways.  Any usage of Web Services
      should be done in the context of a thorough understanding of the
      dependencies, especially as it relates to the DNS and HTTP.

   NOTE: There will be more types of ONS service for ESDS.


7.  Examples

   NOTE: These are examples only.  They are taken from ongoing work and
   may not represent the end result of that work.  They are here for
   pedagogical reasons only.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


9.  Additional Consideration

   Besides the ONS, this document can also be applicable to the other
   naming system using DNS for the addressing of RFID objects.


10.  Security considerations

   This document raises no security issues.  Security considerations
   related to the ONS and DNS can be found in [19].
