INTERNET-DRAFT Terminology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  October 2003

   1. Introduction

   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and 
   being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is 
   necessary to test that router in operational conditions by 
   simultaneously configuring and scaling network protocols and security 
   policies, forwarding traffic, and managing the device.  It is helpful 
   to accelerate these network operational conditions so that the 
   router under test can be benchmarked with faster test duration.  
   Testing a router in accelerated network conditions is known as 
   Accelerated Stress Testing.  

   This document defines the Benchmark Planes used for the Accelerated 
   Life Benchmarking.  These are the Control Plane, Data Plane, 
   Management Plane, and Security Plane.  For each plane, the 
   Configuration Set, Startup Conditions, and Instability Conditions.  
   Terms are also defined for observing Failure Conditions and reporting    
   Benchmarks.  White Box benchmarks are provided in Appendix 1 for 
   additional DUT behavior measurements.
 
   2.  Existing definitions

   RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect 
   Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching 
   Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this 
   document.

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3. Term definitions

	Inability to management the DUT due to the inability
	to gain remote access to the DUT.

      Discussion:
	Handling of Instability Conditions may cause a Control Plane failure 
	of the DUT externally observable as the inability to remotely manage 
	the DUT.  Whether using SNMP, Telnet, SSH, or FTP, failure to manage 
	the device constitues a failure.
 
      Measurement units:
	Failed session

      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
	Unexpected Packet Loss
	Unexpected Session Loss
	Misrouted Packets

   3.5.5 Errored Management Value

      Definition: 
	Incorrect SNMP object value or statistic during the Accelerated 
	Life Benchmark.  

      Discussion:
	Management of a router relies upon accurate reporting of object
	values and statistics.  The Accelerated Stress Benchmarkinging validates
	that the DUT is able to report correct values when experiencing
	Instability Conditions.
 
      Measurement units:
	Name of incorrect object or statistic
	
      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
	Unexpected Packet Loss
	Unexpected Session Loss
	Misrouted Packets
	Access Denial
	Security Plane Failure	
	Success Threshold

   3.5.6 Security Plane Failure
      Definition: 
	Violation of Security Policy for packets directed to the DUT
	or routed through the DUT.

      Discussion:
	Security Policy is configured to permit and deny access to packets
	destined for the DUT and packets to be routed through the DUT. 
	A violation of this security policy is when either a packet to 
	be denied is permitted or a packet to be permitted is denied.
 
      Measurement units:
	packets

      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
	Unexpected Packet Loss
	Unexpected Session Loss
	Misrouted Packets
	Access Denial
	Errored Management Value

   3.6 Benchmarks

   3.6.1 Success Threshold

     Definition: 
	The intended number of hours for the DUT to operate without failure
	during the Accelerated Stress Benchmarking.

      Discussion:
	Success Threshold is a user determined value of time.  It is 
	necessary to define the Success Threshold because it is possible
	for the DUT to experience zero failures for given Configuration 
	Sets, Startup Conditions, and Instability Conditions
 
      Measurement units:
	Hours

      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
	Accelerated-Life Test Duration


   3.6.2 Accelerated-Life Test Duration

      Definition: 
	The run-time for the Accelerated Stress Test without the DUT 
	exhibiting an error in the control plane, data plane, management 
	plane, or security plane.

      Discussion:
	For a successful test, the Test Duration will equal the 
	Success Threshold.  In the event of any failure, the Test Duration 
	is less than the Success Threshold.  Reporting of the Test
	Duration MUST inlcude the Failure Condition from those defined
	in this document.

      Measurement units:
	Hours

      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
	Success Threshold

   4. Security Considerations
        Documents of this type do not directly effect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
