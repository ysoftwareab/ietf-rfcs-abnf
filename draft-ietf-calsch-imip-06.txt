1  Introduction

This binding document provides the transport specific information
necessary convey iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
Protocol (iTIP) over MIME as defined in [RFC-822] and [RFC-2045].


1.1 Related Memos

Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
scheduling standards.

This document, [iMIP], specifies an Internet email binding for iTIP.

[ICMS] - specifies a common terminology and abstract;

[iCAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
properties and property parameters;

[iTIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling between
different implementations;

This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are made
to the memo that provides for the specification of these concepts or
definitions.


1.2 Formatting Conventions

The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose. In order to
refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
or interoperability protocol defined in [ICMS], [iCAL] and [iTIP] some
formatting conventions have been used.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

Calendaring and scheduling roles described by [ICMS] are referred to in
quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper
case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User"
within the scheduling protocol defined by [iTIP].

Calendar components defined by [iCAL] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start with the letter
"V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component,
"VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to
the daily journal calendar component.



Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          3                 Expires March 1999


Internet Draft                    iMIP                  August 25, 1998


Scheduling methods defined by [iTIP] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for
requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified,
"REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update
their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.

Properties defined by [iCAL] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-
strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
"ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey the
calendar address of a calendar user.

Property parameters defined by [iCAL] are referred to with lower case,
quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "parameter". For example,
"value" parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to
override the default data type for a property value.


1.3 Terminology

The email terms used in this memo are defined in [RFC-822] and [RFC-
2045]. The calendaring and scheduling terms used in this memo are
defined in [ICMS], [iCAL] and [iTIP].


2  MIME Message Format Binding

This section defines the message binding to the MIME electronic mail
transport.

The sections below refer to the "originator" and the "respondent" of an
iMIP message. Typically, the originator is the "Organizer" of an event.
The respondent is an "Attendee" of the event.

The [RFC-822] "Reply-To" header typically contains the email address of
the originator or respondent of an event. However, this cannot be
guaranteed as Mail User Agents (MUA) are not required to enforce iMIP
semantics.


2.1 MIME Media Type

A MIME entity containing content information formatted according to this
document will be referenced as a "text/calendar" content type. It is
assumed that this content type will be transported through a MIME
electronic mail transport.


2.2 Security

This section addresses several aspects of security including
Authentication, Authorization and Confidentiality. Authentication and
confidentiality can be achieved using [RFC-1847] that specifies the
Security Multiparts for MIME. This framework defines new content types
and subtypes of multipart: signed and encrypted. Each contains two body


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          4                 Expires March 1999


Internet Draft                    iMIP                  August 25, 1998


parts: one for the protected data and another for the control
information necessary to remove the protection.


2.2.1     Authorization

In [iTIP] messages, only the "Organizer" is authorized to modify or
cancel calendar entries they organize. That is, spoof@xyz.com is not
allowed to modify or cancel a meeting that was organized by
a@example.com. Furthermore, only the respondent has the authorization to
indicate their status to the "Organizer". That is, the "Organizer" must
ignore an [iTIP] message from spoof@xyz.com that declines a meeting
invitation for b@example.com.

Implementations of iMIP SHOULD verify the authenticity of the creator of
an iCalendar object before taking any action. The methods for doing this
are presented later in this document.

[RFC-1847] Message flow in iTIP supports someone working on behalf of a
"Calendar User" through use of the "sent-by" parameter that is
associated with the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties. However,
there is no mechanism to verify whether or not a "Calendar User" has
authorized someone to work on their behalf. It is left to
implementations to provide mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to make
that decision.


2.2.2     Authentication

Authentication can be performed using an implementation of [RFC-1847]
"multipart/signed" that supports public/private key certificates.
Authentication is possible only on messages that have been signed.
Authenticating an unsigned message may not be reliable.


2.2.3     Confidentiality

To ensure confidentiality using iMIP implementations should utilize
[RFC-1847]-compliant encryption. The protocol does not restrict a
"Calendar User Agent" (CUA) from forwarding iCalendar objects to other
users or agents.


2.3 [RFC-822] Addresses

The calendar address specified within the "ATTENDEE" property in an
iCalendar object MUST be a fully qualified, [RFC-822] address
specification for the corresponding "Organizer" or "Attendee" of the
"VEVENT" or "VTODO".

Because [iTIP] does not preclude "Attendees" from forwarding "VEVENTS"
or "VTODOS" to others, the [RFC-822] "Sender" value may not equal that
of the "Organizer". Additionally, the "Organizer" or  "Attendee" cannot
be reliably inferred by the [RFC-822] "Sender" or "Reply-to" values of


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          5                 Expires March 1999


Internet Draft                    iMIP                  August 25, 1998


an iMIP message.  The relevant address MUST be ascertained by opening
the "text/calendar" MIME body part and examining the "ATTENDEE" and
"ORGANIZER" properties.


2.4 Content Type

A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this
document MUST have an [RFC-2045] "Content-Type" value of
"text/calendar". The [RFC-2045] "Content-Type" header field must also
include the type parameter "method". The value MUST be the same as the
value of the "METHOD" calendar property within the iCalendar object.
This means that a MIME message containing multiple iCalendar objects
with different method values must be further encapsulated with a
"multipart/mixed" MIME entity. This will allow each of the iCalendar
objects to be encapsulated within their own "text/calendar" MIME entity.

A "charset" parameter MUST be present if the iCalendar object contains
characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set. [RFC-2046]
discusses the selection of an appropriate "charset" value.

The optional "component" parameter defines the iCalendar component type
contained within the iCalendar object.

The following is an example of this header field with a value that
indicates an event message.


        Content-Type:text/calendar; method=request; charset=UTF-8;
              component=vevent

The "text/calendar" content type allows for the scheduling message type
to be included in a MIME message with other content information (i.e.,
"multipart/mixed") or included in a MIME message with a clear-text,
human-readable form of the scheduling message (i.e.,
"multipart/alternative").

In order to permit the information in the scheduling message to be
understood by MIME user agents (UA) that do not support the
"text/calendar" content type, scheduling messages SHOULD be sent with an
alternative, human-readable form of the information.


2.5 Content-Transfer-Encoding

Note that the default character set for iCalendar objects is UTF-8. A
transfer encoding SHOULD be used for iCalendar objects containing any
characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set.


2.6 Content-Disposition

The handling of a MIME part should be based on its [RFC-2045] "Content-
Type".  However, this is not guaranteed to work in all environments.


Dawson/Mansour/Silverberg          6                 Expires March 1999


Internet Draft                    iMIP                  August 25, 1998


Some environments handle MIME attachments based on their file type or
extension. To operate correctly in these environments, implementations
may wish to include a "Content-Disposition" property to define a file
name.



3  Security Considerations

The security threats that applications must address when implementing
iTIP are detailed in [iTIP].  Two spoofing threats are identified:
Spoofing the "Organizer", and Spoofing an "Attendee". To address these
threats, the originator of an iCalendar object must be authenticated by
a recipient.  Once authenticated, a determination can be made as to
whether or not the originator is authorized to perform the requested
operation. Compliant applications MUST support signing and encrypting
text/calendar attachments using a mechanism based on Security Multiparts
for MIME [RFC-1847] to facilitate the authentication the originator of
the iCalendar object. Implementations MAY provide a means for users to
disable signing and encrypting.  The steps are described below:

1. The iCalendar object MUST be signed by the "Organizer" sending an
update or the "Attendee" sending a reply.

2.  Using the [RFC-1847]-compliant security mechanism, determine who
signed the iCalendar object. This is the "signer". Note that the signer
is not necessarily the person sending an e-mail message since an e-mail
message can be forwarded.

3. Correlate the signer to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar
object.  If the signer cannot be correlated to an "ATTENDEE" property,
ignore the message.

4. Determine whether or not the "ATTENDEE" is authorized to perform the
operation as defined by [iTIP]. If the conditions are not met, ignore
the message.

5. If all the above conditions are met, the message can be processed.

To address the confidentiality security threats, signed iMIP messages
SHOULD be encrypted by a mechanism based on Security Multiparts for MIME
[RFC-1847].

It is possible to receive iMIP messages sent by someone working on
behalf of another "Calendar User". This is determined by examining the
"sent-by" parameter in the relevant "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" property.
[iCAL] and [iTIP] provide no mechanism to verify that a "Calendar User"
has authorized someone else to work on their behalf.  To address this
security issue, implementations MUST provide mechanisms for the
"Calendar Users" to make that decision before applying changes from
someone working on behalf of a "Calendar User".

4.2 Using Multipart Alternative for Low Fidelity Clients

This example shows how a client can emit a multipart message that
includes both a plain text version as well as the full iCalendar object.
Clients that do not support text/calendar will still be capable of
rendering the plain text representation.

5  Recommended Practices

This section outlines a series of recommended practices when using a
messaging transport to exchange iCalendar objects.


5.1 Use of Content and Message IDs

The [iCAL] specification makes frequent use of the URI for data types in
properties such as "DESCRIPTION", "ATTACH", "CONTACT" and others. Two
forms of URIs are Message ID (MID) and Content ID (CID). These are
defined in [RFC-2111]. Although [RFC-2111] allows referencing messages

or MIME body parts in other MIME entities or stores, it is strongly
recommended that iMIP implementations include all referenced messages
and body parts in a single MIME entity. Simply put, if an iCalendar
object contains CID or MID references to other messages or body parts,
implementations should ensure that these messages and/or body parts are
transmitted with the iCalendar object. If they are not there is no
guarantee that the receiving "CU" will have the access or the
authorization to view those objects.
