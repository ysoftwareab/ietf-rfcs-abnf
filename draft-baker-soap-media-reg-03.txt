Abstract

   This document defines the "application/soap+xml" media type which can
   be used to describe SOAP 1.2 messages serialized as XML.

1. Introduction

   SOAP version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended for
   exchange of structured information between peers in a decentralized,
   distributed environment. It defines an extensible messaging framework
   that contains a message construct based on XML technologies that can
   be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols.

   This specification defines the media type "application/soap+xml" 
   which can be used to identify SOAP 1.2 message envelopes that have 
   been serialized with XML 1.0. Such serializations are useful as the 
   basis "wire formats" for SOAP 1.2 Protocol Binding Specifications 
   [SOAP12P1], or in other situations where an XML serialization of a 
   SOAP envelope is required.

2. Registration

   The registration form can be found in Appendix A of the "SOAP 1.2
   Part 2: Adjuncts" [SOAP12P2] specification.
