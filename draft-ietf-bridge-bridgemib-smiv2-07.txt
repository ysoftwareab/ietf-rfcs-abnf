Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on
   the IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard between Local Area Network (LAN)
   segments.  Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.
   Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges

   connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.

   The MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of the
   BRIDGE-MIB defined in RFC 1493 to the SMIv2 syntax.

   This memo obsoletes RFC 1493.

1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging; transparent and
   source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined in the
   IEEE 802.1D specification [IEEE8021D].  This memo defines those
   objects needed for the management of a bridging entity operating in
   the transparent mode, as well as some objects applicable to all types
   of bridges.

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB module as simple as
   possible.  This was accomplished by applying the following criteria
   to objects proposed for inclusion:

   1.  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as
       further objects are needed.
   2.  Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration
       management.
   3.  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.
   4.  Limit the total of objects.
   5.  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this or
       other MIB modules.

   6.  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  The
       guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section
       per layer.

3.1  Structure of the MIB Module

   Objects in this MIB module are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.  Where
   appropriate the corresponding IEEE 802.1D [IEEE8021D] management
   object name is also included.

   this group will not be implemented.  This group is applicable to

   source route only, and SRT bridges.  This group will be described in
   a separate document applicable only to source route bridging.

3.1.4  The dot1dTp Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to transparent bridging.  If transparent bridging is not
   supported this group will not be implemented.  This group is
   applicable to transparent only and SRT bridges.

3.1.5  The dot1dStatic Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to destination-address filtering.  If destination-address
   filtering is not supported this group will not be implemented.  This
   group is applicable to any type of bridge which performs destination-
   address filtering.

3.2  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
   included in this MIB module because they overlap with objects in
   other MIB modules applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In
   particular, it is assumed that a bridge implementing the BRIDGE-MIB
   module will also implement (at least) the 'system' group of the
   SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] the 'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

3.2.1  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   In the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418], the 'system' group is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems.  Thus, those objects apply to the entity
   as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole functionality is
   bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of the entity's
   functionality.

3.2.2  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   In the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863], the 'interfaces' group is
   defined as being mandatory for all systems and contains information
   on an entity's interfaces, where each interface is thought of as
   being attached to a `subnetwork'.  (Note that this term is not to be
   confused with `subnet' which refers to an addressing partitioning
   scheme used in the Internet suite of protocols.) The term 'segment'
   is used in this memo to refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an
   Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual
   circuit.

   Implicit in this BRIDGE-MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each



Norseth & Bell           Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 Bridge MIB                   October 2004


   of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   group, and in most situations, each port is associated with a
   different interface.  However, there are situations in which multiple
   ports are associated with the same interface.  An example of such a
   situation would be several ports each corresponding one-to-one with
   several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range
   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).

   Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through
   the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such
   situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface
   is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This
   subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of
   protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not
   being bridged.  For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas
   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only
   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as
   being bridged.

   Thus, this BRIDGE-MIB (and in particular, its counters) are
   applicable only to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces
   which is sent/received for a protocol being bridged.  All such data
   is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

3.3  Textual Conventions

   This document introduces the textual conventions BridgeId and Timeout
   and imports the MacAddress textual convention from RFC 2579
   [RFC2579].  Objects defined using these conventions are always
   encoded by means of the rules that define their primitive type.
   These textual conventions are adopted merely for the convenience of
   readers.

   Timeout ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "A STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds.
           To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
           1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

               b = floor( (n * 256) / 100)

           where:
               floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
               n is the value in 1/100 second units
               b is the value in 1/256 second units

           To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
           1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
               n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)

           where:
               ceiling = quotient [if remainder is 0], or
                         quotient + 1 [if remainder is nonzero]
               n is the value in 1/100 second units

               b is the value in 1/256 second units

           Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
           done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first,
           divide second)."

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The writable objects dot1dStpPriority, dot1dStpBridgeMaxAge,
      dot1dStpBridgeHelloTime, dot1dStpBridgeForwardDelay,
      dot1dStpPortPriority, dot1dStpPortEnable, and dot1dStpPortPathCost
      influence the spanning tree protocol.  Unauthorized write access
      to these objects can cause the spanning tree protocol to compute
      other default topologies or it can change the speed in which the
      spanning tree protocol reacts to failures.
   o  The writable object dot1dTpAgingTime controls how fast dynamically
      learned forwarding information is aged out.  Setting this object
      to a large value may simplify forwarding table overflow attacks.
   o  The writable dot1dStaticTable provides a filtering mechanism
      controlling to which ports frames originating from a specific
      source may be forwarded.  Write access to this table can be used
      to turn provisioned filtering off or to add filters to prevent
      rightful use of the network.

   o  The readable objects defined in the BRIDGE-MIB module provide
      information about the topology of a bridged network and the
      attached active stations.  The addresses listed in the
      dot1dTpFdbTable usually reveal information about the manufacturer
      of the MAC hardware, which can be useful information for mounting
      other specific attacks.
   o  The two notifications newRoot and topologyChange are emitted
      during spanning tree computation and may trigger management
      systems to inspect the status of bridges and to recompute internal
      topology information.  Hence, forged notifications may cause
      management systems to perform unnecessary computations and to
      generate additional SNMP traffic directed to the bridges in a
      network.  Forged notifications therefore may be part of a denial
      of service attack.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  Acknowledgments

   The MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of the
   BRIDGE-MIB defined in [RFC1493] to the SMIv2 syntax.  The original
   authors of the SMIv1 module were E.  Decker, P.  Langille, A
   Rijsinghani and K.  McCloghrie.  Further acknowledgement is given to
   the members of the original Bridge Working Group in [RFC1493].

   This document was produced on behalf of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   in the Operations and Management area of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force.  The editors wish to thank the members of the Bridge MIB
   Working Group, especially Mike MacFadden and Bert Visscher for their
   many comments and suggestions which improved this effort.  Juergen
   Schoenwaelder helped in finalizing the draft for publication.

7.  Changes from RFC 1493

   The following changes have been made from RFC 1493.

   1.  Translated the MIB definitions to use SMIv2.  This includes the
       introduction of conformance statements.  ASN.1 type definitions
       have been converted into textual-conventions and several units
       clauses were added.
   2.  The object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 was added to support IEEE
       802.1t.
   3.  Permissible values for dot1dStpPriority and dot1dStpPortPriority
       have been clarified for bridges supporting IEEE 802.1t or IEEE
       802.1w.
   4.  Interpretation of dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange has been
       clarified for bridges supporting the rapid spanning tree protocol
       (RSTP).
   5.  Updated the introductionary boilerplate text, the security
       considerations section and the references to comply with the
       current IETF standards and guidelines.
   6.  Updated references to point to newer IEEE 802.1d documents.
   7.  Additions and clarifications in various description clauses.

8.  Open Issues

   This list of open issues should be cleared and removed before this
   document hits the IESG.

   1.  The revised BRIDGE-MIB adds dot1dStpPortPathCost32 and makes it
       mandatory.  I think this is broken since existing deployed
       implementations won't support that object and thus are not
       compliant.  Can someone please explain in which situations the
       increased range of dot1dStpPortPathCost32 is actually needed?  Is
       this only relevant for rapid spanning tree? In that case, I think
       the object should be conditionally mandatory for boxes that do
       rapid spanning tree and the old one stays current, probably with
       a special value to use in case dot1dStpPortPathCost32 actually
       has the larger path cost.
   2.  Rename "Authors' Addresses" to "Contact Information" and add
       original authors to the contact information section.
   3.  Is the unit of dot1dTpPortMaxInfo bytes? I guess so but it was
       never spelled out.  Reading this object from bridges from
       different vendors lead to rather large and varying numbers...
