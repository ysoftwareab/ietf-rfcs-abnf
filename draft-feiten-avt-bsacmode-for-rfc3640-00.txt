2.    Introduction

This draft proposes a new mode for RFC 3640 [1] to support the MPEG-4 
AAC-BSAC audio codec. In addition, the new mode shall allow attaching 
a bitstream description to support the scaling of the bitrate. The 
bitstream description employs the MPEG-21 generalized Bitstream Syntax 
Description Language (gBSDL). The MPEG-21 digital item adaptation 
framework can be used for content agnostic adaptation of the bitrate. 
A bitstream description with a related transformation style sheet is 
used by an adaptation processor, e.g. a content adaptation node 
located in the network, to adapt the bitstream. The adaptation can 
take constraints like network characteristics and terminal 
capabilities under consideration. The adaptation framework is fully 
described in the MPEG-21 Part-7 Digital Item Adaptation [2].

Internet-Draft          New BSAC mode for rfc3640           March 2005



RFC 3640 so far defines five modes: 
        Generic		               generic
        Constant Bitrate Celp     CELP-cbr
        Variable Bitrate Celp     CELP-vbr
        Low Bitrate AAC           AAC-lbr
        High Bitrate AAC          AAC-hbr

Additional modes are expected to be defined in future RFCs. Each 
additional mode MUST be in full compliance with RFC 3640.

Any new mode for RFC 3640 MUST be defined such that an implementation 
including all the features described in RFC 3640 can decode the 
payload format corresponding to this new mode. For this reason, a mode 
MUST NOT specify new default values for MIME parameters. In 
particular, MIME parameters that configure the RTP payload MUST be 
present (unless they have the default value), even if its presence is 
redundant in case the mode assigns a fixed value to a parameter. A 
mode may additionally define that:

  o Some MIME parameters are required instead of optional,

  o Some MIME parameters have fixed values (or ranges), and 

  o There are rules restricting the mode's usage.


3.    Mode Scalable Bitrate BSAC

This draft proposes a new mode "Scalable Bitrate BSAC" named "BSAC-
gbsd". The mode is signalled with the SDP [3] fmtp parameter 
mode=BSAC-gbsd [4]. The mode supports the transportation of variable 
size BSAC frames. In one RTP packet, either one or more complete BSAC 
frames are carried, or a fragment of a single BSAC frame is carried. 
The BSAC frames are allowed to be interleaved and hence receivers MUST 
support de-interleaving.  The maximum size of a BSAC frame in this 
mode is 2048 octets.
 
This mode makes use of the AU Header Section and the Auxiliary Section 
followed by either one BSAC frame, several concatenated BSAC frames, 
or a fragment of a single BSAC frame. 

For reasons of efficiency the AU Header Section is only used if 
several BSAC frames are packet together. In that case for each BSAC 
frame contained in the payload, there MUST be an AU-header in the AU 
Header Section to provide:

   a) the size of each BSAC frame in the payload and

   b) index information for computing the sequence (and hence timing)

Internet-Draft          New BSAC mode for rfc3640           March 2005



To code the maximum size of a BSAC frame requires 11 bits.    
Therefore, in this configuration 11 bits are allocated to the AU-   
size, and 5 bits to the AU-Index(-delta) field. Thus, each AU-header   
has a size of 2 octets.  Each AU-Index field MUST be coded with the    
value 0. In the AU Header Section, the concatenated AU-headers MUST be 
preceded by the 16-bit AU-headers-length field, as specified in 
section 3.2.1. of RFC 3640.

The Auxiliary Section MAY contain a description of the bitstream. The 
description uses the MPEG-21-DIA generalized bitstream description 
language (gBSD). The description provides information on the scaling 
structure of the AU data section.

The AU Data Section consists of either one BSAC frame, several 
concatenated BSAC frames, or a fragment of a single BSAC frame.

In addition to the already required MIME format parameters, 
auxiliaryDataSizeLength MUST be present. An auxiliaryDataSizeLength of 
2 octets SHALL be used to simplify the decoding. The parameters 
sizeLength, indexLength, indexDeltaLength MAY be used to configure the 
AU Header Section. If the sizeLength parameter is not present it is 
assumed that no AU Header Section is used and a single frame is stored 
in the payload.

Furthermore, the BSAC frames have a constant duration that is 
signalled as SDP fmtp parameter [3].
 
For example:

   m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/44100/2
   a=fmtp:96 streamtype=5; profile-level-id=22; mode=BSAC-gbsd;
   config=2C90; sizeLength=11; indexLength=5; indexDeltaLength=5;
   auxiliaryDataSizeLength=16; constantDuration=1024

Note: The a=fmtp line has been wrapped to fit the page; it comprises a 
single line in the SDP file.

The hexadecimal value of the "config" parameter is the 
AudioSpecificConfig(), as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3.

5.    IANA Considerations

This section describes the MIME types and names associated with this 
new mode for payload format. 

5.1.  MIME Type Registration
Only a new mode is defined.

5.2.  Registration of Mode Definitions
RFC 3640 can be used in a number of modes.  The mode of  operation is 
signaled using the "mode" MIME parameter.  New modes may be defined at 
any time. These modes MUST be registered with IANA, to ensure that 
there is not a clash of names. 

The following additional mode MAY be signalled in RFC 3640

   mode=BSAC-gbsd.

6.  Security Considerations

RTP packets using mod defined in this specification are subject to the 
security considerations discussed in the RFC 3640 [1].  This implies 
that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.  
Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied 
end-to-end, encryption may be performed on the compressed data so 
there is no conflict between the two operations. Future application 
that support that adaptation of encrypted scalable bitstreams require 
appropriate encryption systems.

The packet processing complexity of this payload type (i.e., excluding 
media data processing) does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity 
in the receiver side to cause a denial-of-service threat. However, it 
is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, Video, and 
Systems) so that the receiver/decoder's buffers are overloaded, which 
might compromise the functionality of the receiver or even crash it.

Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate the sender and the 
data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
MPEG-4 streams.

This draft proposes a new mode "Scalable Bitrate BSAC" named "BSAC-
gbsd". The mode is signalled with the SDP [3] fmtp parameter 
mode=BSAC-gbsd [4]. The mode supports the transportation of variable 
size BSAC frames. In one RTP packet, either one or more complete BSAC 
frames are carried, or a fragment of a single BSAC frame is carried. 
The BSAC frames are allowed to be interleaved and hence receivers MUST 
support de-interleaving.  The maximum size of a BSAC frame in this 
mode is 2048 octets.
 
This mode makes use of the AU Header Section and the Auxiliary Section 
followed by either one BSAC frame, several concatenated BSAC frames, 
or a fragment of a single BSAC frame. 

For reasons of efficiency the AU Header Section is only used if 
several BSAC frames are packet together. In that case for each BSAC 
frame contained in the payload, there MUST be an AU-header in the AU 
Header Section to provide:

   a) the size of each BSAC frame in the payload and

   b) index information for computing the sequence (and hence timing)

To code the maximum size of a BSAC frame requires 11 bits.    
Therefore, in this configuration 11 bits are allocated to the AU-   
size, and 5 bits to the AU-Index(-delta) field. Thus, each AU-header   
has a size of 2 octets.  Each AU-Index field MUST be coded with the    
value 0. In the AU Header Section, the concatenated AU-headers MUST be 
preceded by the 16-bit AU-headers-length field, as specified in 
section 3.2.1. of RFC 3640.

The Auxiliary Section MAY contain a description of the bitstream. The 
description uses the MPEG-21-DIA generalized bitstream description 
language (gBSD). The description provides information on the scaling 
structure of the AU data section.

The AU Data Section consists of either one BSAC frame, several 
concatenated BSAC frames, or a fragment of a single BSAC frame.

In addition to the already required MIME format parameters, 
auxiliaryDataSizeLength MUST be present. An auxiliaryDataSizeLength of 
2 octets SHALL be used to simplify the decoding. The parameters 
sizeLength, indexLength, indexDeltaLength MAY be used to configure the 
AU Header Section. If the sizeLength parameter is not present it is 
assumed that no AU Header Section is used and a single frame is stored 
in the payload.

Furthermore, the BSAC frames have a constant duration that is 
signalled as SDP fmtp parameter [3].
 
For example:

   m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/44100/2
   a=fmtp:96 streamtype=5; profile-level-id=22; mode=BSAC-gbsd;
   config=2C90; sizeLength=11; indexLength=5; indexDeltaLength=5;
   auxiliaryDataSizeLength=16; constantDuration=1024

Note: The a=fmtp line has been wrapped to fit the page; it comprises a 
single line in the SDP file.

The hexadecimal value of the "config" parameter is the 
AudioSpecificConfig(), as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3.

5.    IANA Considerations

This section describes the MIME types and names associated with this 
new mode for payload format. 

5.1.  MIME Type Registration
Only a new mode is defined.

5.2.  Registration of Mode Definitions
RFC 3640 can be used in a number of modes.  The mode of  operation is 
signaled using the "mode" MIME parameter.  New modes may be defined at 
any time. These modes MUST be registered with IANA, to ensure that 
there is not a clash of names. 

The following additional mode MAY be signalled in RFC 3640

   mode=BSAC-gbsd.

6.  Security Considerations

RTP packets using mod defined in this specification are subject to the 
security considerations discussed in the RFC 3640 [1].  This implies 
that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.  
Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied 
end-to-end, encryption may be performed on the compressed data so 
there is no conflict between the two operations. Future application 
that support that adaptation of encrypted scalable bitstreams require 
appropriate encryption systems.

The packet processing complexity of this payload type (i.e., excluding 
media data processing) does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity 
in the receiver side to cause a denial-of-service threat. However, it 
is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, Video, and 
Systems) so that the receiver/decoder's buffers are overloaded, which 
might compromise the functionality of the receiver or even crash it.

Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate the sender and the 
data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
MPEG-4 streams.
