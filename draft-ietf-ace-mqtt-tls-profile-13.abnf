   Topic filters are implemented according to Section 4.7 of MQTT v5.0 -
   the OASIS Standard [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5].  By default, Wildcard
   Subscriptions are supported, and so, the topic filter may include
   special wildcard characters.  The multi-level wildcard, '#', matches
   any number of levels within a topic, and the single-level wildcard,
   '+', matches one topic level.  The Broker MAY signal in the CONNACK
   explicitly whether wildcard subscriptions are supported by returning
   a CONNACK property "Wildcard Subscription Available".  A value of 0
   means that Wildcard Subscriptions are not supported.  A value of 1
   means Wildcard Subscriptions are supported.
