   Abstract

      This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprocal
      Label Switched Protocol Pings from proxy Label Switching Routers.
      The motivation for this facility is to limit the number of
      messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in large
      Point-to-Multipoint LSPs.

1. Introduction

   It is anticipated that very large Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) will exist.  Further it is anticipated that
   many of the applications for P2MP tunnels will require OAM that is
   both rigorous and scalable.

   Suppose one wishes to trace a P2MP LSP to localize a fault which is
   affecting one egress or a set of egresses.  Suppose one follows the
   normal procedure for tracing - namely repeatedly pinging from the
   root, incrementing the TTL by one after each three or so pings.  Such
   a procedure has the potential for producing a large amount of pro-
   cessing at the P2MP-LSP midpoints and egresses.  It also could pro-
   duce an unwieldy number of replies back to the root.

   An alternative would be to begin sending pings from points at or near
   the affected egress(es) and working backwards toward the root.  The
   TTL could be held constant as say two, limiting the the number of
   responses to the number of next-next-hops of the point where the ping
   was initiated.

   The above procedure does require that the root know the previous-hop
   node to the one which was pinged on the prior iteration.  This infor-
   mation is readily available in [P2MP-TE].  This document provides a
   means for obtaining this information for [mLDP] as well as defining a
   means for remotely causing an MPLS echo request message to be sent
   down a Label Switched Path (LSP) or part of an LSP.

   While the motivaton for this document came from multicast scaling
   concerns, its applicability may be wider.  However other uses of this
   facility are beyond the scope of this document.  Further the discus-
   sion is cauched in terms of multipoint LSPs.


1.1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KeyWords].

   The term "Must Be Zero" (MBZ) is used in object descriptions for
   reserved fields.  These fields MUST be set to zero when sent and
   ignored on receipt.

   Based on context the terms leaf and egress are used interchangeably.
   Egress is used where consistency with [RFC4379] was deemed appropri-
   ate.  Receiver is used in the context of receiving protocol messages.

2. Remote Ping Overview

   Two new LSP Ping messages are defined for remote pinging, the MPLS
   remote echo message and the MPLS remote echo reply.

   A remote ping operation on a P2MP LSP involves at least three LSRs;
   in some scenarios none of these are the ingress (root) or an egress
   (leaf) of the LSP.

   We refer to these nodes with the following terms:

   Initiator  -  the node which initiates the ping operation by sending
                 an MPLS remote echo message

   Proxy LSR   - the node which is the destination of the MPLS remote
                 echo message and potential initiator of the MPLS echo
                 request

   Receiver(s) - the receivers of the MPLS echo request messages

   The initiator formats an MPLS remote echo message and sends it to the
   proxy LSR, a node it believes to be on the path of the LSP.  This
   message specifies the MPLS echo request to be sent inband of the LSP.
   It may also request the proxy LSR to acknowledge the receipt of the
   remote echo message and/or respond with the address of the previous
   hop, i.e. the LSR upstream of it on this LSP.

   The proxy LSR validates that it has a label mapping for the specified
   FEC and that it is authorized to send the specified MPLS echo request
   on behalf of the initiator.  Depending on the Reply Mode carried in
   the header of the remote echo message and the above results an MPLS
   remote echo reply message might be sent back to the initiator.  This
   message may also communicate the address of the previous hop.

   If the proxy LSR has a label mapping for the FEC and and all autho-
   rization check have passed, the proxy LSR formats an MPLS echo
   request.  If the source address of the IP packet is not the initia-
   tor, it includes a ReplyTo object containing the initiator's address.
   It then sends it inband of the LSP.

   The receivers process the MPLS echo request as normal, sending their
   MPLS echo replies back to the initiator.

3. Remote Echo / Reply Pprocedures

3.1. Procedures for the initiator

   The initiator creates an MPLS remote echo message.

   The message MUST contain a Target FEC Stack that describes the FEC
   being tested.

   [Note for the current version of the ID, the FEC stack is limited to
   a single FEC as we have not yet fully considered the operational and
   security impacts of permitting more FECs]

   The message MUST contain a Remote Echo Parameters object.  The
   address type is set to either IPv4 or IPv6.  The Destination IP
   Address is set to the value to be used in the MPLS echo request
   packet. If the Address Type is IPv4, an address from the range 127/8.
   If the Address Type is IPv6, an address from the range
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104.  By default the source address will be set to
   an address of the proxy LSR.  Flags MAY be set to request use of
   either the ingress' source address or the initiators source address.

   The Reply mode and Global Flags of the Remote Echo Parameters object
   are set to the values to be used in the MPLS echo request message
   header.  The Source UDP Port is set to the value to be used in the
   MPLS echo request packet.  The TTL is set to the value to be used in
   the outgoing MPLS label stack.  See section 5.2.2.2 for further
   details.

   Flags MAY be set to request the previous hop address and/or a down-
   stream mapping object from the proxy LSR.

   A list of Next Hop IP Addresses MAY be included to limit the next
   hops towards which the MPLS echo request message will be sent.

   Any of following objects MAY be included; these objects will be
   copied into the MPLS echo request messages:

            Target FEC Stack
            Pad
            Vendor Enterprise Number
            Reply TOS Byte
            P2MP Egress Identifier [McstPing]
            Echo Jitter TLV [McstPing]
            Vendor Private TLVs

   Downstream Mapping objects MAY be included.  These objects will be
   matched to the next hop address for inclusion in those particular

Internet Draft  draft-swallow-mpls-remote-lsp-ping-00.txt   October 2006


   MPLS echo request messages.

   The message is then encapsulated in a UDP packet.  The source UDP
   port is chosen by the sender; the destination UDP port is set to
   3503.  The IP header is set as follows: the source IP address is a
   routable address of the sender; the destination IP address is a
   routable address of the midpoint.  The packet is then sent with the
   IP TTL is set to 255.


3.2. Procedures for the proxy LSR

   A proxy LSR that receives an MPLS remote echo message, parses the
   packet to ensure that it is a well-formed packet.  It checks that the
   TLVs that are not marked "Ignore" are understood.  If not, it sets
   the Return Code set to "Malformed echo request received" or "TLV not
   understood" (as appropriate), and the Subcode set to zero.  If the
   Reply Mode of the message header is not 0, an MPLS remote echo reply
   message SHOULD be sent as described below.  In the latter case, the
   misunderstood TLVs (only) are included in an Errored TLVs object.

   The header fields Sender's Handle and Sequence Number are not exam-
   ined, but are saved to be included in the MPLS remote echo reply and
   MPLS echo request messages.

   The proxy LSR validates that it has a label mapping for the specified
   FEC, it then determines if it is an egress, transit or bud node and
   sets the Return Code as appropriate.

   The proxy LSR then determines if it is authorized to send the speci-
   fied MPLS echo request on behalf of the initiator.  An LSR MUST be
   capable of filtering addresses to validate initiators.  Other filters
   on FECs or MPLS echo request contents MAY be applied.  If a filter
   has been invoked (i.e. configured) and an address does not pass the
   filter, then an MPLS echo request message MUST NOT be sent, and the
   event SHOULD be logged.  An MPLS remote echo reply message may be
   sent with a Return Code of <tba>, "Remote Ping not authorized".

   If the "Ingress Source Address" flag is set and the proxy LSR is con-
   figured to allow to use the ingress address, the proxy LSR determines
   the ingress LSR.  If the address is found, it is used as the source
   address of the MPLS echo request.  Otherwise the Return Code is set
   to <tba>, "Unable to use ingress source address".  If the Reply Mode
   of the message header is not 0, an MPLS remote echo reply message
   SHOULD be sent as described below.

   If the "Initiator Source Address" flag is set and the proxy LSR is
   configured to allow to use the iniator's address it is used as the

Internet Draft  draft-swallow-mpls-remote-lsp-ping-00.txt   October 2006


   source address of the MPLS echo request.  Otherwise the Return Code
   is set to <tba>, "Unable to use intiator source address".  If the
   Reply Mode of the message header is not 0, an MPLS remote echo reply
   message SHOULD be sent as described below.

   If the "Request for Previous Hop" flag is set, a PHOP Address Object
   is formatted for inclusion in the MPLS remote echo reply.  If the
   previous HOP is unknown or ambiguous the Address Type is set to "No
   Address Supplied".

   If there is a list of Next Hop addresses in the Remote Echo Parame-
   ters object, each address is examined to determine if it is a next
   hop for this FEC.  If any are not, those addresses are deleted from
   the list.  The updated Remote Echo Parameters object is included in
   the MPLS remote echo reply.

   If the "Request for Downstream Mapping" flag is set the LSR formats a
   Downstream Mapping object for each interface that the MPLS echo
   request will be sent out.

   If the Reply Mode of the message header is not 0 or 5, an MPLS remote
   echo reply message SHOULD be sent as described below.


3.2.1. Sending an MPLS remote echo reply

   The Reply mode, Sender's Handle and Sequence Number fields are copied
   from the remote echo message.  Various objects are included as speci-
   fied above.  The message is encapsulated in a UDP packet.  The source
   IP address is a routable address of the proxy LSR; the source port is
   the well-known UDP port for LSP ping.  The destination IP address and
   UDP port are copied from the source IP address and UDP port of the
   echo request.  The IP TTL is set to 255.


3.2.2. Sending the MPLS echo requests

   A base MPLS echo request is formed as decribed in the next section.
   The section below that describes how the base MPLS echo request is
   sent on each interface.


3.2.2.1. Forming the base MPLS echo request

   A Next_Hop_List is created as follows.  If Next Hop addresses were
   included in the received Remote Echo Parameters object, the
   Next_Hop_List is copied from the Remote Echo Parameters object as
   adjusted above.  Otherwise, the list is set to all the next hops to

   which the FEC would be forwarded.

   The proxy LSR then formats an MPLS echo request message.  The Global
   Flags and Reply Mode are copied from the Remote Echo Parameters
   object.  The Return Code and Return Subcode are set to zero.

   The Sender's Handle and Sequence Number are copied from the remote
   echo message.

   The TimeStamp Sent is set to the time-of-day (in seconds and
   microseconds) that the echo request is sent.  The TimeStamp Received
   is set to zero.

   The following objects are copied from the MPLS remote echo message.
   Note that of these, only the Target FEC Stack is REQUIRED to appear
   in the MPLS remote echo message.

            Target FEC Stack
            Pad
            Vendor Enterprise Number
            Reply TOS Byte
            P2MP Egress Identifier [McstPing]
            Echo Jitter TLV [McstPing]
            Vendor Private TLVs

   If the source address of the IP packet is not the address of the ini-
   tiator, it includes a ReplyTo object (see [SelfTest]) containing the
   initiator's address.

   The message is then encapsulated in a UDP packet.  The source UDP
   port is copied from the Remote Echo Parameters object.  destination
   ports are copied from the remote echo message.

   If either the "Initiator Source Address" or "Initiator Source
   Address" flags is set, the source address is set as specified.  Oth-
   erwise the source IP address is set to a routable address of the
   proxy LSR.  Per usual the TTL of the IP packet is set to 1.


3.2.2.2. Per interface sending procedures

   The proxy LSR now iterates through the Next_Hop_List modifying the
   base MPLS echo request to form the MPLS echo request packet which is
   then sent on that particular interface.

   For each next hop address, the outgoing label stack is determained.
   The TTL for the label corresponding to the FEC in the FEC stack is
   set such that the TTL on the wire will be one less than the TTL

Internet Draft  draft-swallow-mpls-remote-lsp-ping-00.txt   October 2006


   specified in the remote echo message.  If any additional labels are
   pushed onto the stack, their TTLs are set to 255.

   If the MPLS remote echo message contained Downstream Mapping objects,
   they are examined.  If the Downstream IP Address matches the next hop
   address that Downstream Mapping object is included in the MPLS echo
   request.

   The packet is then transmitted on this interface.


4. Remote Echo / Reply Messages

   Two new LSP Ping messages are defined for remote pinging, the MPLS
   remote echo message and the MPLS remote echo reply.


4.1. Remote Echo / Reply Message formats

         Request for Previous Hop        0x04

            When set this requests that the proxy LSR supply the PHOP
            address in the MPLS remote echo reply message

         Request for Downstream Mapping  0x08

            When set this requests that the proxy LSR supply a
