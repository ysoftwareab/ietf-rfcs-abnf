Abstract

   The transcendence of the user-operator dichotomy through interactive
   computing greatly empowered the programmers of early time-sharing
   systems and subsequent operating systems.  Earth is examined in the
   light of history as the largest known time-sharing system in
   operation, and Omnics, a synergistic planet operating system, is
   proposed.

1.  Introduction

   Fifty years ago today, in a time of scarce computing resources, the
   Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) system was
   presented in a series of influential papers.[CORBATO] It pioneered a
   suite of innovative features to facilitate resource sharing between
   multiple users and programs, and inspired generations of developers
   and operating systems.  As computer technology reached the critical
   point where computers became personal, operating systems changed, and
   some of the features were forgotten and discarded, while others
   forgotten and kept.

   Now is the time of another turning point.  With the growth of the
   Internet and the Web, computing cannot be considered strictly
   personal any longer.  A different set of needs emerges, and a system
   for planetary computing becomes a priority.

2.  System Requirements

   The Internet has made possible what visionary humanists of the past
   could only hope for.  Possible, but not actual.  Regarding Earth as a
   limited cybernetic system, it appears overrun by disregarding users
   with conflicting programs.  Physical and informational resources are
   allocated on brute force or chance, the programs of the few constrain
   those of the many, and most damage the system to the detriment of
   all.  The planet is being operated without a proper operating system.

   Omnics is an attempt at one and functions as an intermediate layer
   between low-level resources and high-level applications.  By

   definition, its creation requires widespread adoption, and for this
   reason it is to be built on existing operating systems, interpreted
   languages and application protocols, offering maximum compatibility
   and minimum difficulty.

3.  The Omnics System

   The roles of Multics and Omnics are similar, but at different levels.
   Omnics must orchestrate dissonances harmoniously in the real world,
   but not through the application, whether believed to be objective or
   not, of a particular economic theory or political ideology.  It
   should be remembered that never in human history has an ideology
   proven itself final, complete, or sustainable by force.  Therefore,
   Omnics must start with the least assumptions that could possibly work
   and evolve alongside its users and their conceptions.  Open-endedness
   is the only presupposition.

4.  Design Features of the Hardware

   Many technological hurdles which had to be overcome by Multics are no
   longer an issue, but, as is often the case, the power of technology
   has surpassed the power of self-control.  Brain-computer interfaces
   have been developed since the seventies, and may critically reduce
   communication latency one day, but as long as human comprehension
   lags behind, Omnics has to be designed against miscontrol.

   Because a lot of the early computer research was military-funded,
   concerns for the resilience and reliability of computer systems were
   primary.  Distributed operating systems predate Multics, and their
   qualities, as well as other network effects, can benefit Omnics
   through the adoption of the Internet as its framework.

5.  Design Features of the Software

   A key aspect of operating systems in general, and distributed ones in
   particular, is inter-process communication.  Omnics seeks to elevate
   this exchange to the level of dialogue[BOHM] as the essential mode of
   operation, collapsing unidirectional relationships between programmer
   and user, writer and reader, governor and governed.

   The Web has made conversation possible on an unprecedented scale, but
   as a hypertext system it is not without flaws.  Omnics can build upon
   it in a symbiotic partnership, but not if it functions as
   contemporary web operating systems, that is to say browser-based
   desktops maintaining monological assumptions.  A truly global
   operating system is not the transference of personal computer
   operating systems onto the web, but their transcendence.

   The limits of the system are the affordances of its application
   interface and user interface.  Because certain interactions
   strengthen corresponding behaviors, Omnics must never be thought of
   purely as an information space.  Implicit functions give tacit
   consent to what may be in conflict with explicit expressions.  A
   correspondence between the two is needed.

6.  Design Considerations in the File System

   Hierarchical file systems, as we know them today, began with Multics.
   Whereas it recognized the importance of non-hierarchical links across
   the tree structure, subsequent operating systems have neglected them.
   That a task as basic as organizing one's digital photos based on
   multiple criteria of time, place and people is not easily achievable
   shows a fundamental flaw of modern information architecture.  The
   topology of the world's information is not hierarchical but
   networked.

   Files, as monolithic blackboxes resisting referencing, recombination,
   reconceptualization and recontextualization, and folders, as
   partitions cutting sharply across fuzzy boundaries, reduce
   understanding and creativity, especially in conjunction with
   proprietary formats and encodings.  The file-folder dichotomy can be
   transcended through a hyperfile[NELSON] system containing and being
   directed by hyperdata.

7.  Design Considerations in the Communication and Input/Output
    Equipment

   Computing as public utility has been a central concern of Multics
   from its earliest beginnings.  The more recent proliferation of
   accessible devices has renewed interest in what is now called cloud
   computing, but its benefits have not been substantial.  A computing
   utility limited to data storing and processing is limited in value if
   it doesn't assist its users in deriving meaning from the data.
   Additionally, the privatization of computing in centralized clusters
   consolidates traditional power structures and commercializes personal
   information.  Decentralization is the defence against control.

8.  Security Considerations

   Though the subversion of the system by malicious users is made harder
   by its architecture, even local disturbances are rough problems, and
   they require elegant solutions.  Spamming, sock-puppetting and ballot
   stuffing are legitimate concerns, but surveillance and invasion of
   privacy are illegitimate measures.  The nature of the solution should
   be analogous to that of the problem, so that programmatic exploits

   are handled algorithmically, and individual abuses personally, but
   not suppresively.

9.  General Considerations

   Omnics is not set in silicon.  This document constitutes a small step
   in the creation of a large system whose difficulty lies not the
   implementation but the elegance and acceptance of its principles.  As
   a first draft, the writing is intentionally non-committal, and the
   obscurity is an impetus for its development along lines of clarity
   rather than totality.

10.  Conclusion

   Ultimately, Omnics is about self-knowledge, mutual understanding and
   common good.  It requires the good will of good people, to set the
   standard and the tone of the developments and discussions that have
   to follow.
