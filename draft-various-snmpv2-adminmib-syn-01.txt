    1.  Introduction

    A management system contains:  several (potentially many) manageable
    nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access
    to management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
    management protocol.  The management protocol is used to convey
    management information between the agents and management stations; and,
    for manager-to-manager communications, between management stations.
    Operations of the protocol are carried out under an administrative
    framework which defines authentication, authorization, access control,
    and privacy policies.

    Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
    control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as hosts,
    routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled via
    access to their management information.

    It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects such that
    an SNMPv2 entity can be configured via SNMP operations to control what
    access rights are granted to a particular entity, given the identity of
    that entity as determined by a security protocol.

    The MIB described in this document provides objects which can be used to
    configure access rights for multiple types of management operations,
    including configuration of proxy operations.


    2.  Potential Scope

    An SNMPv2 manager and an SNMPv2 agent are defined as the operational
    roles which can be assumed by an SNMPv2 entity.  An SNMPv2 entity which
    sometimes acts in an agent role and sometimes in a manager role is
    termed an SNMPv2 dual-role entity [@ref v2admin].

    In order for SNMPv2 operations to be able to configure operational
    parameters such as access rights, an SNMPv2 entity must act, at least
    some of the time, in an agent role.  Thus, the scope of managed objects
    to support such remote configuration potentially extends to include both
    SNMPv2 agents and SNMPv2 dual-role entities.

    2.1.  Requirements for SNMPv2 Agents

    An SNMPv2 agent needs to know the access rights authorized for each
    identity which a security protocol might provide, in order to receive
    retrieval and/or modification requests.  These access rights specify the

    Internet Draft    SNMPv2 Administrative MIB for SNMPv2    September 1995


    types of operations permitted as well as the MIB views to which access
    is authorized for a particular local context at a particular security
    level.  It also needs to know which notifications are authorized to be
    sent on behalf of which identities, and the transport addresses to which
    such notifications should be sent.  In addition, it is valuable for a
    manager to determine the set of local contexts which are (potentially)
    accessible via this SNMPv2 agent, including indications of the temporal
    domains [@ref v2admin] of such contexts.

    It is worth noting that in each of these situations, a simple SNMPv2
    agent (one which is not a part of a dual-role entity and which does not
    perform proxy forwarding operations) never sends or receives a message
    having an authSnmpID value or contextSnmpID value other than its own.
    Thus, it has no need for any information other than is used to access
    its own set of MIB objects.  In particular, there is no need for one
    agent to maintain information about the authentication/privacy protocols
    and their secret key values used to access other agents.

    However, this is not the case for dual-role entities such as mid-level
    managers and proxy SNMPv2 agents.

    2.2.  Requirements for SNMPv2 Dual-Role Entities

    There are two categories of SNMPv2 dual-role entities:  so-called mid-
    level managers and proxy SNMPv2 agents.  In each case, a dual-role
    entity both sends and receives requests or notifications; it also sends
    and receives messages for multiple values of snmpID.

    A proxy SNMPv2 agent needs to know the context values identifying proxy
    contexts for which it acts as a proxy agent, and for each such proxy
    context, the security protocol, snmpID, and identity with which it
    forwards received requests and trap notifications for that context.

    It is also likely that a SNMPv2 dual-role entity will need to maintain a
    set of mappings between snmpID values and transport values, either to
    record agents which have been discovered by this dual-role entity or to
    allow it to be configured with such information.

    On the other hand, a SNMPv2 dual-role entity does not need to maintain
    the authorization information about the access rights of identities, nor
    information about the composition of MIB views in order to conduct its
    functions as a mid-level manager or to conduct proxy forwarding
    operations.

    3.  Structure of MIB

    This MIB consists of seven tables and several scalars.  However, not all
    agents will require implementation of all tables and scalars defined in
    this MIB.  In fact, some low-cost agent implementations may only
    implement read-only versions of the first three tables listed below and
    the appropriate scalars, and leave the rest of the MIB unimplemented.

    The tables are:

      -  v2ContextTable

         The table of all contexts for which the agent conducts local agent
         operations.

         This table must be implemented by all systems, although it may be
         read-only.

      -  viewTreeTable

         The table containing information on subtrees of MIB views known to
         this agent.

         This table must be implemented by all systems, although it may be
         read-only.

      -  acTable

         The table of access rights configured in the agent's local
         configuration datastore.

         This table must be implemented by all systems, although it may be
         read-only.

      -  transportTable

         The table of transport endpoints [optionally] used for
         authenticating the source of management operations, and for
         destinations for proxy forwarding operations and notification
         operations (traps and inform requests).

         This table need only be implemented by systems which allow remote
         configuration of trap destinations, inform destinations, or proxy
         parameters.

    Internet Draft    SNMPv2 Administrative MIB for SNMPv2    September 1995


      -  notifyTable

         The table of trap and inform configurations authorized to be sent
         on behalf of specific identities.

         This table need only be implemented by systems which allow remote
         configuration of trap parameters or inform parameters.

      -  notifyInformParametersTable

         The table, which augments the notifyTable, contains additional
         parameters for sending inform requests.

         This table need only be implemented by systems which allow remote
         configuration of inform parameters.

      -  proxyForwardingTable

         The table of configurations for which an agent is authorized to act
         as a proxy.

         This table need only be implemented by systems which allow remote
         configuration of proxy parameters.

    The scalars are:

      -  snmpID

         The unique 12-octet identifier of an SNMPv2 entity.  Each SNMPv2
         entity which originates Get, GetNext, GetBulk, or Set request
         operations or trap notifications, or which acts as a sink for
         Inform notification operations, or which performs proxy forwarding
         operations must be assigned a value of snmpID.


      -  snmpMaxMessageSize

         The maximum message size that can be sent or received by an SNMPv2
         entity, determined as the minimum of the maximum message size
         values supported among all of the transports available to and
         supported by the entity.

         This object must be implemented by all systems.

         notifyTable.

    4.  Authorizing Notifications

    The destination(s) to which a notification is authorized to be sent is
    determined by consulting the notifyTable to find all entries satisfying
    the following conditions:

      -  The value of notifyContextName refers to a context containing the
         local management information contained in the notification.

      -  The notification's administratively assigned name is accessible
         within the corresponding MIB view.  (That is, the set of entries in
         the viewTreeTable, for which the instance of viewTreeName has the
         same value as notifyViewName, defines a MIB view which contains the
         notification's administratively assigned name.)

      -  If the OBJECTS clause is present in the invocation of the
         corresponding NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro, then the correspondent
         variables are all present in the MIB view corresponding to
         notifyViewName.

      -  For any additional variables which the generating SNMPv2 entity
         chooses to include within the notification, then these variables
         are all present in the MIB view corresponding to notifyViewName.

    For each such entry, a notification is authorized to be sent on behalf
    of the identity associated with that entry, using the security protocol
    associated with that entry, with context notifyContextName, and to each
    transport address associated with the specified notifyTransportLabel.

    In the absence of other (filtering) information to the contrary, each of
    these authorized notifications should be sent.

    5.  Transport Endpoints

    The transportTable contains information about transport endpoints.  This
    table is capable of representing sets of transport endpoints.  This is
    accomplished in two ways.  The use of an address mask allows
    specification of things like IP subnets.  The use of a sub-indexing
    allows grouping of conceptual rows within the table.

    The following examples demonstrate the use of the transportTable.
    Although these examples are IP-centric, the transportTable may be used
    to represent transport end-points in other domains.  In this case, the
    semantics of address masks depend on the particular transport domain
    being represented.

    The address mask capability allows, for example, an agent to accept as
    authentic only packets received from a particular subnet.  For example,
    the following configuration can be used to specify that only packets
    from subnet 1.2.3.0, received on UDP port 161, be accepted as authentic:
           transportLabel = subnet1
           transportSubindex = 1
           transportAddress = 1.2.3.0.161
           transportReceiveMask = 255.255.255.0.255

    The sub-indexing capability allows, for example, an agent to be
    configured to send traps to a set of IP addresses.  The following
    configuration allows an agent to send traps to IP addresses 1.2.3.4 and
    1.2.3.5 on UDP port 162:
           transportLabel = subnet1
           transportSubindex = 1
           transportAddress = 1.2.3.4.162
           transportReceiveMask = 255.255.255.255.0
           transportLabel = subnet1
           transportSubindex = 2
           transportAddress = 1.2.3.5.162
           transportReceiveMask = 255.255.255.255.0
    This configuration also allows the agent to receive authenticated
    packets from any ports at addresses 1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.5.

    The use of the transportTable is, in part, determined by the definition
    of the tables which reference it.  However, in general, when sending a
    trap notification, the transportReceiveMask would be ignored, and the
    trap would be sent to the specific addresses specified by
    transportAddress.  When authenticating a message, the transportAddress
    and transportReceiveMask would generally be used in combination to check
    the transport endpoint which originated the message.  This means that

    Internet Draft    SNMPv2 Administrative MIB for SNMPv2    September 1995


    the transportReceiveMask values in the example above could actually be
    255.255.255.0.0, in which case traps would still be sent to two IP
    addresses, but messages would be accepted as authentic from the entire
    1.2.3.0 subnet.

                    the first (next) 16-bytes of the new value of K.
                  - the above two steps are repeated until the unused
                    portion of the delta component is 16 bytes or less,

              Each MIB view is defined by two collections of view subtrees:
              the included view subtrees, and the excluded view subtrees.
              Every such subtree, both included and excluded, is defined in
              this table.

              To determine if a particular object instance is in a
              particular MIB view, compare the object instance's OBJECT
              IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active entries
              in this table.  If none match, then the object instance is
              not in the MIB view.  If one or more match, then the object
              instance is included in, or excluded from, the MIB view
              according to the value of viewTreeType in the entry whose
              value of viewTreeSubTree has the most sub-identifiers.  If
              multiple entries match and have the same number of
              sub-identifiers, then the lexicographically greatest instance
              of viewTreeType among those which match determines the inclusion
              or exclusion.

              An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an active
              entry in this table when the number of sub-identifiers in X
              is at least as many as in the value of viewTreeSubTree for
              the entry, and each sub-identifier in the value of
              viewTreeSubTree matches its corresponding sub-identifier in X.
              Two sub-identifiers match either if the corresponding bit of
              viewMask is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if they are equal.

              Due to this 'wild card' capability, we introduce the term, a
              'family' of view subtrees, to refer to the set of subtrees
              defined by a particular combination of values of
              viewTreeSubTree and viewTreeMask.  In the case where no
              'wild card' is defined in viewTreeMask, the family of view
              subtrees reduces to a single view subtree."

              Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the
              corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if
              an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this family of view subtrees; a
              '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0'
              indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value
              matches.

              Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is
              contained in a family of view subtrees if the following
              criteria are met:

                  for each sub-identifier of the value of viewTreeSubTree,
                  either:

                      the i-th bit of viewMask is 0, or

                      the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
                      sub-identifier of the value of viewTreeSubTree.

              If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are
              more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of
              viewTreeSubTree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be
              the required length.

              Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length
              string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's
              being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of view
              subtrees is the one view subtree uniquely identified by the

              the corresponding octets must match, and a '0' indicates that
              any octet value matches.

              Thus, an instance of v2ContextEntry is identified if, for each
              bit in the corresponding value of acContextNameMask,
              either:

                  the bit of acContextNameMask is 0, or

                  the length of acContextName and v2ContextName are both
                  at least i octets, and the i-th octet of
                  acContextName is equal to the i-th octet of
                  v2ContextName.

              It is not permitted for multiple conceptual rows in the acTable
              to identify the same v2ContextName in this manner, for a
              particular acSPI and acGroupName pair.  If a Set request
              attempts to modify a conceptual row in the acTable in a way such
              that the combination of acContextName and acContextNameMask as
              described above would yield the same value as the combination of
              acContextName and acContextNameMask of another conceptual row in
              the same conceptual table, for which the corresponding values of
              acSPI are equal and the corresponding values of acGroupName are
              equal, then an inconsistentValueError should be returned, and
              the Set operation should fail.

              If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are
              more than M octets in the corresponding instance of either
              acContextName or v2ContextName, then the bit mask is
              extended with 1's up to the maximum of the two lengths."

              the transportTable whose values of transportLabel equal the
              value of this object, designating the transport endpoint(s) to
              which proxied requests will be forwarded.

              Note that this object may specify multiple transport endpoints
              to which a proxied request may be forwarded.  If this is the
              case, then the first response to the forwarded request which
              is received will be accepted, and subsequent responses will
              be discarded.  In the case of proxy trap forwarding, multiple
              transport end-points simply represent a proxy fan-out."

              For those columnar objects which permit write-access, their
              value in an existing conceptual row can be changed
