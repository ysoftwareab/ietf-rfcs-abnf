Abstract

   RFC1122 defines nodes TCP stack behavior for ICMPv4 error messages,
   but does not for ICMPv6.  This document defines ICMPv6 message
   classification and node's TCP stack behavior for ICMPv6.


1.  Introduction

   RFC1122 [RFC1122] section 4.2.3.9 describes nodes reaction to ICMPv4

   error message for TCP stack.  However, currently, there are no clear
   corresponding definition about ICMPv6.  This document defines nodes'
   TCP stack behavior to ICMPv6 error messages.


2.  Definition of reactions to ICMPv4 in RFC1122

   RFC1122 section 4.2.3.9 defines nodes behavior to ICMPv4 as follows:

   4.2.3.9 ICMP Messages

   TCP MUST act on an ICMP error message passed up from the IP layer,
   directing it to the connection that created the error.  The necessary
   demultiplexing information can be found in the IP header contained
   within the ICMP message.

   Source Quench

      TCP MUST react to a Source Quench by slowing transmission on the
      connection.  The RECOMMENDED procedure is for a Source Quench to
      trigger a "slow start," as if a retransmission timeout had
      occurred.

   Destination Unreachable -- codes 0, 1, 5

      Since these Unreachable messages indicate soft error conditions,
      TCP MUST NOT abort the connection, and it SHOULD make the
      information available to the application.

      DISCUSSION:

      TCP could report the soft error condition directly to the
      application layer with an upcall to the ERROR_REPORT routine, or
      it could merely note the message and report it to the application
      only when and if the TCP connection times out.

   Destination Unreachable -- codes 2-4

      These are hard error conditions, so TCP SHOULD abort the
      connection.

   Time Exceeded -- codes 0, 1

      This should be handled the same way as Destination Unreachable
      codes 0, 1, 5 (see above).

   Parameter Problem

      This should be handled the same way as Destination Unreachable
      codes 0, 1, 5 (see above).


   Here, codes of ICMPv4 destination unreachable message defined in
   RFC792 [RFC0792] are:

   code 0: net unreachable;
   code 1: host unreachable;
   code 2: protocol unreachable;
   code 3: port unreachable;
   code 4: fragmentation needed and DF set;
   code 5: source route failed.


3.  Definition of reactions to ICMPv6

   In IPv6, types and codes of ICMPv6 error messages are defined in
   RFC4443 [RFC4443].  Those are:

   type 1: Destination Unreachable

      code 0: No route to destination
      code 1: Communication with destination administratively prohibited
      code 2: Beyond scope of source address
      code 3: Address unreachable
      code 4: Port unreachable
      code 5: Source address failed ingress/egress policy
      code 6: Reject route to destination

   type 2: Packet Too Big

   type 3: Time Exceeded

      code 0: Hop limit exceeded in transit
      code 1: Fragment reassembly time exceeded

   type 4: Parameter Problem

      code 0: Hop limit exceeded in transit
      code 1: Fragment reassembly time exceeded

   The document SOFTERROR [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-soft-errors] describes the
   correspondence between ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 destination unreachable
   messages.  Corresponding ICMPv6 definition is as follows.

   TCP MUST act on an ICMPv6 error message passed up from the IP layer,
   directing it to the connection that created the error.  The necessary
   demultiplexing information can be found in the IP header contained
   within the ICMPv6 message.

   Destination Unreachable -- codes 0,3

      Since these Unreachable messages indicate soft error conditions,
      TCP MUST NOT abort the connection, and it SHOULD make the
      information available to the application.

      DISCUSSION:

      TCP could report the soft error condition directly to the
      application layer with an upcall to the ERROR_REPORT routine, or
      it could merely note the message and report it to the application
      only when and if the TCP connection times out.

   Destination Unreachable -- codes 1,2,4-6

      These are hard error conditions, so TCP SHOULD abort the
      connection.

   Packet Too Big

      TCP should react to this message as described in RFC1981
      [RFC1981].

   Time Exceeded -- codes 0, 1

      This should be handled the same way as Destination Unreachable
      codes 0, 3 (see above).

   Parameter Problem -- codes 0, 1

      This should be handled the same way as Destination Unreachable
      codes 0, 3 (see above).


4.  Discussion

   o  When a node have multiple communication methods/protocols (e.g.an
      IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack node), and the node is in the connection
      establishment phase (SYN-SENT or SYN-RECEIVED state), it should
      abort current connection and try next methods/protocols even if it
      receives 'ICMPv6 soft error' messages.  This modification is
      described in SOFTERROR.

   o  New ICMPv6 error messages definition should include reaction in
      upper layer.



5.  Security Considerations

   As described in SOFTERROR security considerations section, there
   would be some security risks to process ICMPv6 error messages for
   established connections.  Above document describes how to avoid these
   risks.
