Abstract 
    
   This document outlines some issues with the use of ARP over GMPLS 
   controlled Ethernet router-to-router (PSC) interfaces transiting from 
   a non-Ethernet core, e.g., FSC or LSC GMPLS core. The document also 
   proposes solutions accordingly.

1.   Introduction 
                   
   This draft address the scenario where edge routers are connected via 
   a non-Ethernet switch capable GMPLS core, e.g., FSC or LSC core. 
   Furthermore, the interfaces between the router and the optical device 
   (OXC) are Ethernet.  
    
   When an LSP Path is established between the Ingress Router to Egress 
   Router, Ethernet interface at the two routers comes up. However, 
   before this LSP (or interface) can forward any IP traffic, MAC 
   address of the remote router needs to be learned.  
    
   End-point MAC address needs to be re-learned, every time the path 
   taken by the GMPLS LSP changes (e.g., due to re-routing or re-
   optimization). This introduces latency that is at least equal to the 
   round trip delay. Such latency adds to the traffic switchover delay 
   and consequently traffic loss for 1:1 protected LSP without extra 
   traffic, or when LSP route changes due to re-routing (restoration) or 
   re-optimization, etc.  
    
   Interop issues in learning end-point MAC address using ARP are also 
   found among vendors at various Interop events/ testing efforts. This 
   is because different vendors use different IP address for ARP 
   resolution. Some LSR vendor uses the address of the TE link at the 
   end-point, while others adapt to use tunnel interface address for 
   ARP. When both end-point TE link address and tunnel interface 
   addresses are unnumbered, the ARP needs to be performed using

   loopback addresses. Some routers do not reply to ARP request sent to 
   a loopback address.  
    
   Issue with the use of IP address for ARP can be resolved by agreeing 
   on use of IP address and by requiring ARP using Loopback addresses. 
   However, issue associated with ARP latency and traffic loss for 1:1 
   protected LSP without extra traffic, or when LSP route changes due to 
   due to re-routing (restoration) or re-optimization, etc. could not be 
   addressed when we rely on ARP to learn end-point MAC address. 
   Consequently, this document proposes use of RSVP object 
   (END_POINT_MAC_ADDR) to carry hardware addresses at the two end of 
   the LSP, in the Path and Resv messages.  
 
2.   END_POINT_MAC_ADDR Object 
 
   The END_POINT_MAC_ADDR object has a class number TBA by IANA (of type 
   11bbbbbb), C-Type of TBD and length of 28.  The format is given 
   below.

   This object can optionally appear in either a Path message or a Resv 
   message. 
    
   The Ingress LSR puts the MAC address of its outgoing physical 
   interface (this is the first component link in the route, which is 
   hosted by the Ingress Router) in the Path message. When the Egress 
   Router receives a Path message with the END_POINT_MAC_ADDR object, it 
   adds END_POINT_MAC_ADDR object to the Resv message and puts the MAC 
   address of incoming physical interface (this is the last component 
   link in the route, which is host by the Egress Router).  
    
3.   Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce new security issues. The security 
   considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol [RFC2205] 
   remain relevant.
