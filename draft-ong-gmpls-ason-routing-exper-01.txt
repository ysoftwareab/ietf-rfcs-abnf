Abstract

   IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support
   ASON routing requirements.  These extensions have been given EXP
   status rather than Standards Track and according to guidelines for
   OSPFv2 have not been allocated standard codepoints by IANA. This
   work has continued in [OSPFASON].

   This draft defines a set of proposed updates for a subset of the
   the ASON routing extensions for OSPFv2 defined in [OSPFASON]. 
   These proposed updates have already benefited from running code
   tested in multiple interoperability testing events, with at least
   eight independent implementations. The differences from [OSPFASON]
   are the result of field and interoperability testing experience.

   These formats are proposed to either be folded in to [OSPFASON], 
   or be a separate Standards Track RFC covering
   a subset of the ASON extensions to OSPFv2, as preferred by the 
   working group. We believe that adopting these formats will help
   move those parts of [OSPFASON] towards Standards Track, while
   preserving the functionality defined in [OSPFASON].

1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T defines the architecture of the Automatically Switched
   Optical Network (ASON) in [G.8080].

   [RFC4258] details the routing requirements for the GMPLS suite of
   routing protocols to support the capabilities and functionality of
   ASON control planes identified in [G.7715] and in [G.7715.1].

   [RFC4652] evaluates the IETF Link State Routing Protocols against the
   requirements identified in [RFC4258]. Section 7.1 of [RFC4652]
   summarizes the capabilities to be provided by OSPFv2 [RFC2328] in
   support of ASON routing. This document details a set of OSPFv2
   extensions supporting a subset of the capabilities identified in 
   [RFC4652] which have already been implemented and tested for 
   interoperability across at least 8 independent implementations.

   Note that these extensions have been tested in a transport-only
   instance of OSPF, i.e. routing implementations supported only optical
   routing and did not participate in any IP routing use of OSPF.

   This draft also compares the implemented extensions to those
   defined in [OSPFASON], which defines experimental OSPFv2
   extensions in support of [RFC4652] capabilities. The changes from
   [OSPFASON] are the result of field and interoperability testing
   experience, and are either minor format changes or supplementary
   information found useful in field testing.  We believe that adop- 
   ting the extensions in this draft will further progress [OSPFASON].


2.  Comparison with [OSPFASON]

   This draft defines formats similar to some defined in [OSPFASON].
   This section gives a high level comparison of the two formats.

2.1. Reachable Address Prefix Advertisement

   Uses a single TLV to carry multiple values of TE Router_ID and
   associated IPv4 or IPv6 address prefixes, rather than separate
   TLVs as in [OSPFASON].  

   In the IPv4 prefix format, uses Prefix Length to indicate the
   prefix length rather than a Network Mask as in [OSPFASON] (Note
   [OSPFASON] uses Prefix Length for the IPv6 prefix format).

2.2. Router Information Scoping
 
   Uses separate Sub-TLVs to carry Local and Remote TE Router_ID 
   instead of a single Sub-TLV for both, as in [OSPFASON].

2.3. Link Attributes

   Advertises Link Component Availability at multiple TDM layers
   as opposed to or in addition to advertisement of ISCD for an
   individual TDM layer.

3.  Reachability

3.1.  ASON Routing Requirements

   [RFC4652] identifies the need for additional capabilities to
   advertise blocks of reachable address prefixes using a summarization
   mechanism either taking the form of a prefix length (which indicates 
   the number of significant bits in the prefix) or a network mask.

   An OSPF Reachable Address Prefix TLV was implemented and tested
   to support this capability.   This TLV is advertised as the payload
   of a Type 1 Traffic Engineering LSA [RFC3630]. It has the following
   format:"

    0                   1                   2                   3

   This format allows the Reachable Address Prefix TLV to advertise
   multiple TE Router_IDs associated with the advertising entity, as
   well as multiple Reachable Address Prefixes associated with these
   TE Router_IDs.  

   Each IPv4 or IPv6 Reachable Address Prefix sub-TLV is associated
   specifically with the TE Router_ID preceding it in the TLV.

3.2.  Local TE_Router_ID Sub-TLV 

   The Local TE_Router_ID sub-TLV used the following format:
	
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Type (tbd)        |           Length                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Local TE Router_ID                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Local TE Router_ID field advertises a Local TE Router_IDentifier
   being advertised associated with the advertising entity.

3.3 IPv4 Reachable Address Prefix Sub-TLV

   The IPv4 Reachable Address Prefix sub-TLV takes the following form:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type (tbd)       |          Length (variable)    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+              
   |  Pref_length  |                Reserved                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                  IPv4 Reachable Address Prefix                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The following fields are defined:

   Pref_length:  length in bits of the Prefix

   IPv4 Reachable Address Prefix:  Each prefix is encoded as a
   32-bit word with trailing zero bit padding as necessary.

3.4 IPv6 Reachable Address Prefix Sub-TLV

   IPv6 prefixes were not implemented or tested.


4.  Routing Information Scope

4.1.  ASON Routing Requirements

   [RFC4652] identifies the need for an extension to routing protocols
   to support non-1:1 relationships between the Router_ID and TE 
   Router_ID, and as a result the need for the capability to advertise
   the remote Lj value where Lj is a logical control plane entity that
   is associated to a single data plane (abstract) node.

4.2.  Local and Remote TE Router_ID Sub-TLVs

   In order to support this capability, two sub-TLVs of the TE LSA Link
   TLV [RFC3630] are defined for advertising the Local TE Router_ID
   and Remote TE Router_ID.  These use the following formats:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Type              |           Length                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Local TE Router_ID                         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Type              |           Length                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Remote TE Router_ID                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   These sub-TLVs allow the routing protocol to scope the advertised 
   link attributes advertised in an OSPFv2 TE Link LSA for ASON
   routing.

5. Link Attributes

5.1 ASON Requirements

   [RFC4652] notes that in the ASON context, bandwidth accounting 
   representations are possible, taking the form of a set of tuples 
   <signal_type; number of unallocated timeslots>, and that this    
   representation may also require definition of additional signal 
   types (from those defined in [RFC4606]) to represent support of
   contiguously concatenated signals,
   i.e., STS-(3xN)c SPE / VC-4-Nc, N = 4, 16, 64, 256.

   It notes that the ISCD defined in [RFC4202] is the most 
   straightforward without requiring any bandwidth accounting 
   change from an LSR perspective.  However, the ISCD defined
   in [RFC4202} must be advertised once per signal type 
   (identified by the Minimum Reservable Bandwidth value) in
   order to provide an accurate advertisement of bandwidth
   for each signal.  For SONET/SDH links, it is common to support
   4-5 signal types (e.g., STS-1, 3c, 12c, 48c and 192c) at once,
   and advertisement of 4-5 ISCD sub-TLVs would consume about
   200 bytes as compared to 20-30 bytes for a tuple format.

   Most of the ISCD bytes are required to advertise 8 levels of 
   priority.  We believe this overhead can be reduced as (a) ASON
   specifications do not identify priority as an ASON service; and
   (b) TDM networks generally to not support preemption priority 
   at all, not to mention 8 levels.


5.2.  Link Component Availability Sub-TLV

   The Link Component Availability Sub-TLV carries an indication
   of SONET/SDH bandwidth at multiple link component signal types as
   supplementary information to the ISCD sub-TLV.   

   When multiple priorities are used, the Link Component Availability
   Sub-TLV can be interpreted as the availability for Priority 7.

   The following format is defined:

   |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Note: n defines the number of signal types supported on this link,
   and thus has a value greater than or equal to 1.  Inherited from
   [RFC4202], the Switching Capability field and the Encoding field MUST
   take the following values for Sonet/SDH interfaces: Switching
   Capability (8 bits): value 100 (TDM).  Encoding (8 bits): value 5 for
   Sonet/SDH.  Reserved (16 bits): must be set to zero when sent and
   ignored when received.

   Signal Type (8 bits):

      STS-1 SPE / VC-3 [RFC4606]
      STS-3c SPE / VC-4 [RFC4606]
      STS-12c SPE/VC-4-4c 
      STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c 
      STS-192c SPE/VC-4-64c 

   Number of Unallocated Timeslots (24 bits):

   Specifies the number of identical unallocated timeslots per Signal
   Type and per TE Link.  As such, the initial value(s) of this TLV
   indicates the total capacity in terms of number of timeslots per TE
   link.  The signal type included in the BW announcement is specific to
   the layer link being reported and is not derived from some other
   signal type (e.g.  STS-48c is not announced as 16 x STS-3c).

Internet-Draft    draft-ong-gmpls-ason-routing-exper-01    February 2010



   For instance on an OC-192/STM-64 interface either the number of
   STS-3c SPE/VC-4 unallocated timeslots is initially equal to 64, or
   the number of STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c unallocated timeslots is equal to
   4 or even a combination of both type of signals depending on the
   interface capabilities.  Once one of these timeslots is occupied
   either by being allocated for a connection at the same or a larger
   signal type or by being blocked due to the allocation of part of
   the timeslot for a connection at a smaller signal type, the number
   of unallocated timeslots is decreased by the number of timeslots
   this connection implies.


6.  Implementation and Testing Results

   Initial implementation of ASON routing extensions began in 2003.
   Testing of these protocol extensions was carried out at a number of
   testing events from 2003-2009, most recently occurring over a period
   of months during July-September 2007 and April-June 2009.  There were
   7 independent implementations tested at each event as listed below:

Internet-Draft    draft-ong-gmpls-ason-routing-exper-01    February 2010


   All implementations utilized the ASON routing extensions described in
   this draft.

   Results were:

   o  prototype implementations were interoperable
   o  aligned TE database was achieved by participating implementations
   o  path computation was successfully achieved for connections
   o  connections were successfully set up at different SONET/SDH rates
      using the TE database

6.1.  Standardization

   The extensions defined in this draft satisfy a subset of the
   functionality identified in [RFC4258] and [RFC4652] for ASON
   routing.  The results of implementation and interoperability testing
   show that these functions are useful and implementable, and that ASON
   routing extensions to OSPF may be made Standards Track rather than
   Experimental, using the formats implemented and tested.
 
   Standardization of these extensions by IETF for ASON routing support
   would allow fast adoption in the industry due to the presence of
   several existing implementations, i.e., running code.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Propose IANA allocate codepoints for new TLV/sub-TLVs for ASON
   Routing from the standard range.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes implementation and testing experience with
   ASON routing extensions similar to those defined in [OSPFASON].  No
   additional security issues are identified.
