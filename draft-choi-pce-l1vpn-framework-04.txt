 Abstract

   When path computation is done in the management systems for Layer 1
   Virtual Private Networks (L1 VPNs), it would be important that 
   resource information is synchronized between the management systems 
   and the Provider Edge /Provider (PE/P). This draft looks at such a
   scenario from the viewpoint of the Path Computation Element Metric
   Protocol (PCEMP) that acts a generic computation model for path
   based metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer networks. This 
   draft shows how PCEMP messages might help preserving the path 
   computational entities in the L1 VPN peer nodes. 

   This draft proposes to show how a L1 VPN framework may be included
   within the scope of Path Computation Element architectures and is
   derived primarily from the motivation of per VPN peer service 
   solutions using PCE techniques. PCEMP metrics defining path quality 
   measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability criteria 
   for L1 VPNs is in line with the functional specifications of 
   Generalized Traffic Engineered LSP path computation techniques 
   involving Path Computation Element(s) of the PCE WG Charter.

2. Introduction

  This draft addresses L1 VPN frameworks from the PCE perspective with
  the motivation of per VPN peer service model architecture 
  realizations. L1 VPNs provide services over layer 1 networks. This 
  draft provides a framework by those networks controlled by GMPLS 
  protocols. In this context, we show how PCEMP [2], set out by the
  metric definition and analysis requirements of PCE models set forth
  by the PCE WG Charter for an internet routing protocol, may help
  realize this motivation of the peer service model. The next sections
  of this draft go on to show how PCEMP can be a satisfactory solution
  to L1 VPN resource management using path computation techniques.

  The purpose of this draft is informational and is in line with the 
  requirements and architecture work in this field that has been 
  undertaken and is currently going on within the ITU-T.


3. L1 VPN service models and architecture frameworks

3.1 L1 VPN Network Topology

  The L1 network, made of Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs) or Time
  Division Multiplex (TDM) capable switches (we address them as L1 
  nodes), may be seen as consisting of provider edge (PE) devices 
  that give access from outside of the network, and provider (P) 
  devices that operate only within the core of the network. 
  Similarly, outside the layer 1 network is the customer network 
  consisting of customer (C) devices with access to the layer 1 
  network made through customer edge (CE) devices [1]. 

  A CE and PE are connected by one or more links. A CE may also be
  connected to more than one PE, and a PE may have more than one CE
  connected to it [1]. Figure 1 shows such a diagram derived from [1]

  In L1VPN, L1 connections are provided between CE's physical
  interfaces within the same VPN. In Figure 5.1, a connection is
  provided between the lefthand CE of VPN A and the upper righthand CE
  of VPN A, and another connection is provided between the lefthand CE
  of VPN B and lower righthand CE of VPN B (shown as "=" mark) [1].

3.2 Current technologies for dynamic L1 provisioning and deficiencies

  Current UNIs (User Network Interfaces) include features to facilitate 
  requests for end-to-end (i.e. CE-CE) service requests that include 
  the specification of constraints such as explicit paths, bandwidth 
  requirements, protection needs, and destinations.

  The UNIs, however, do not provide a sufficiently high level of
  service to support VPNs without some additions. For example, there is
  no way to distinguish between control messages received over a shared
  control link (i.e., a control link shared by multiple VPNs) at a UNI,
  and these messages must be disambiguated with respect to the L1VPN to
  which they apply [1].

  Further, there is currently no leakage of routing information across
  the PE to CE boundary. While this restriction may be considered
  desirable from the perspective of network separation, VPN operation
  may benefit from the dynamic exchange of routing information
  between CEs that provide access to the VPNs.

  In order that L1 VPNs can be supported in a fully functional manner,
  these deficiencies and other requirements must be addressed. 

  The Path Computation technique may be a useful solution to overcoming
  these deficiencies in current technologies for dynamic L1 
  provisioning. We will show how PCEMP and the associated protocol and
  PCE unit architecture is beneficial for the support of L1 VPNs.


3.3 Per VPN Peer Service Model

  Figure 2 describes the per VPN peer service model.

Choi, Guha                   Informational                    [Page 5]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt    March 2006

  In this service model, the provider partitions the TE links within
  the provider network per VPN, and discloses per VPN TE link
  information to corresponding CEs. As such, a CE receives routing
  information of PE-CE links, remote CE sites, as well as partitioned
  portions of the provider network. This is a good scope of work for
  PCE techniques, with the partitioning of PCEDAs (PCE Domain Areas)
  as shown later on in this draft. Virtual links may be constructed 
  between two nodes where direct physical links do not exist, or 
  virtual nodes may be constructed to represent multiple physical 
  nodes and links. This is in line with the PCEMP model and a direct
  consequence of the protocol architecture.


3.4 Resource management per VPN

  In this type of service model, one optional requirement is resource
  management for a dedicated Data-Plane (the provider network
  partitions link resources per VPN for exclusive use by a particular
  VPN), and resource management for sharing the Data-Plane among a
  specific set of VPNs (the provider network assigns link resources
  to a specific set of VPNs). A simple way to meet this requirement 
  is to implement resource management functionalities in the management 
  systems. However, if the PE/P need path computation locally, not 
  relying on the management systems, then support of resource 
  management in PE/P (e.g., routing protocol extension) is necessary. 
  This is especially beneficial in the case of dynamic restoration 
  (restoration that does not reserve backup resources in advance).

  When path computation is done in the management systems, it would
  be important that resource information is synchronized between the
  management systems and PE/P.

  This is a good scope for the PCEMP architecture where resource
  management support can take place through the SCMs and Fast
  decoding outputs [2]. 

  Currently, there is no solution document for this type of service
  model [1]. This draft using PCEMP could be a suitable answer
  apart from the suggestions suggested in [GVPN] or the virtual
  router approach [VR]. 


4.  Key features of PCEMP 

  This section summarizes the key features of the PCEMP protocol. PCEMP 
  is a generic domain routing and path computation protocol that runs 
  on any PCE unit that is capable of computing a path based on an 
  ordered graph. PCEMP uses data vector techniques for path computation. 
  Individual link state advertisements (LSAs) are mapped onto the 
  computation units directly at TE-LSP setup time. Each PCE unit 
  maintains this mapping information through the controller unit [3] 
  and the mapping synchronization of the LSDBs are performed using PCEMP 
  finite state machines. From this central controller sub-units, each 


Choi, Guha                   Informational                    [Page 6]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt    March 2006


  PCE constructs a routing table by calculating a shortest data vector 
  tree, the root being the calculating PCE node itself.

4.1 Other features of PCEMP for L1 VPN dynamic provisioning

  The other features of the PCEMP protocol that are helpful for dynamic 
  L1 provisioning are:

  1. Central Controller (CC). The central controller acts as the 
  originator of the network's local information environment. The 
  controller also acts in the global scenario of inter domain PCEs and 
  inter layer networks. It serves as the key functional point of the 
  data vector driven algorithm for all PCE information and link state 
  synchronizations by co-ordinating LSP advertisements from other PCEs 
  and LSRs. This is the key element in the L1 VPN peer entities. 

  2. Soft PCE Controller (SPC). A Soft PCE Controller is an entity 
  designed primarily for protection and fast route establishment in 
  conjunction with the Central Controller. The SPC's primary 
  functionality is to provide a robust and real-time path computation 
  adjacency without crossover delays for the data driven algorithm 
  mechanism. Also, this enables the LSP state and path computation 
  state retention in case of nodal faults and hardware failures. 

  3. Support for peer adjacency through non-participating interior 
  nodes. PCEMP treats these nodes opaquely and is able to maintain 
  the PCE adjacencies over inter-domains and inter-layer networks. The 
  protocol is generic and can be easily carried over existing routing 
  mechanisms over non-supporting network clouds. There is no necessity 
  for any additional configuration updates for PCEs attached to such 
  networks for initial discovery as the data driven mechanism is flow 
  based. This is necessary to support peer L1 provisioning over 
  different domains. 

  4. PCE domain areas (PCEDA). PCEMP allows the formation of distinct 
  PCE domain areas in a specific domain for end-to-end peer 
  participations. This is useful for several reasons. This is in line 
  with the protocol architecture that provides a granularity of data 
  protection within an autonomous system and isolation of data to 
  local branches of the tree. This is also helpful for the design of 
  the PCE units using soft memory techniques and reduces the 
  algorithm operation costs. In the per VPN peer service model, 
  the provider partitions the TE links within the provider network 
  per VPN, and discloses per VPN TE link information to corresponding 
  CEs. The partitioning of PCEDAs using PCEMP is a direct driver to
  this mechanism. 

  5. Data driven mapping of external routing information. In PCEMP, 
  each external route is imported into the PCE domain area in separate
  data driven computation strategies. This reduces the amount of 
  instantaneous re-computation of routing traffic data. It also


Choi, Guha                    Informational                    [Page 7]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt     March 2006

  enables partial controller database updates when there is a partial
  external route change. This helps in setting up the L1 VPN paths
  with minimal provisioning turnaround time. 

  6. Three level functional control hierarchy. PCEMP has a three level
  controller hierarchy, intra-PCE-domain, inter-PCE-domain and 
  external-PCE-domain. This is discussed in the context of the 
  Centralized Controller [3] and the L1 VPN provisioning blocks in the
  PCE nodes.

  7. Virtual link mapping. This is done via the real-time configuration 
  of logical local links based on the data-driven strategy of the 
  algorithm. The mechanism is thus made topology independent and 
  generic and can be applied to the Network Topology structure of a 
  L1 VPN as shown in Figure 1.

  8. Soft Computation Memory (SCM). This is a novel feature in terms of 
  path computation in the CC and SPC. It helps split the tree into a 
  combination of sparse subtrees for fast computation. SCM can be used
  to assign metrics of path computation as well as compute data-driven
  flow based mappings in the PCE.
   
  9. Data-driven routing metric. In PCEMP, the computation metrics are 
  assigned to the outbound router interfaces and the soft memory cycles
  in the PCE controller unit. The cost of a path is then the weighted
  sum of the path's component interfaces and the soft memory cycles. 
  The routing and external path metrics can be assigned externally. 

  We now address some of the Path computation fundamentals applicable
  to dynamic L1 provisioning and define the architecture on which the
  PCEMP may be applicable.

          Figure 3. PCE-L1 node based L1 VPN framework using PCEMP

  Figure 3 shows the layered architecture of a PCE based L1 VPN 
  framework for per VPN peer service model. The model is
  facilitated by the use of GMPLS, which supports a concept of 
  common control of packet, TDM, wavelength and fiber services, part
  of the Layer 1 network, and is a key enabler of this new network 
  architecture model using PCE techniques. 
 

5.1 Introduction to PCE nodes and PCEMP peers over the control network

  This draft addresses the coordination of the IP and optical network
  provisioning in the L1 VPN scenario based on a consolidated PCE node 
  and a truly integrated control plane. This PCE node, which comprises
  the path computing unit that supports PCEMP, enables an integrated 
  network architecture where each network layer can freely exchange 
  topology and resource information. This allows network performance 
  to be globally optimized across all layers. In addition, a single 
  control plane and the PCEMP peers that manage all network layers 
  simplify network management tasks and facilitate dynamic L1 
  provisioning.
   
  As far as control and management types for L1 networks are concerned, 
  they can be classified into three categories: centralized, 
  distributed and hybrid control/management. Each control and 


Choi, Guha                    Informational                    [Page 9]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt     March 2006


  management type has its' own advantages and disadvantages, but 
  typical telecommunication networks and automatic switched optical 
  networks (ASON) defined in ITU-T follows a centralized control/
  management architecture in which the control plane is separate from 
  the data plane. In this draft, for path computation purposes, we 
  consider the control plane to be separated logically from the data 
  plane. Separate PCE nodes or control/management networks comprising 
  a series of PCEMP peers could be connected to each other by through 
  signaling channels and appropriate PCEMP message exchanges. If the 
  domains of the control/management networks increase, a hierarchical 
  control/management structure could be applied. This can be fully 
  realized in the PCE node through functional blocks defined by the 
  SCM [2]. There is a channel interface between the PCE node and any 
  L1 node in the Layer 1 network, and this can be realized using PCEMP. 
  In this architecture, the PCE node is responsible for path 
  calculation, recovery and provisioning. Some of the recovery 
  functions are also assigned to nodes in the Layer 1 network for the 
  purpose of control and load balancing.

5.2 Network structure considerations

  Each PCE node is assumed to have L1 and L2/L3 router capabilities in 
  the same hardware setup, which results in the support of multiple 
  traffic types at the same location. The traffic manager in each 
  L1 node also manages multiple traffic types. Each L1 node can 
  communicate directly with the corresponding PCE node to report its 
  status. As mentioned in Section 5.1, this is achieved via PCEMP. 
  The PCE nodes takes care of L1 nodes within the same PCEDA. They 
  also have the responsibility of centralizing domain network management 
  service and integrating the management of the L1 network in their 
  respective domain. This structure permits scalability as well as 
  internetworking of different administrative domains.
     
5.3 Control structure considerations

  Network elements within each domain communicate with one another 
  via a common control plane. We assume a dedicated out-of-band control 
  channel between two adjacent nodes, and between each L1 node and the 
  PCE node. The common control plane can be implemented based on GMPLS. 
  Apart from RSVP and CR-LDP extensions to GMPLS, PCEMP can provide 
  traffic engineering in this unified network architecture for dynamic
  L1 VPN provisioning. Metrics of PCEMP in this regard remains an issue
  for future study. Moreover, neighbor discovery and link state update 
  can employ routing LSA protocols like ISIS and OSPF extensions to 
  GMPLS. 


5.4 Segment wise partitioning using the PCE nodes

  As a network becomes large, the size of the sub networks also become 
  large. Segment wise partitioning into PCEDAs are effected by the PCE
  nodes in the integrated network architecture as mentioned in Section


Choi, Guha                   Informational                   [Page 10]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt    March 2006

  3.1. Additionally, this can support fast recovery and can take care 
  for partially multiple simultaneous failures using the SPCs in the
  PCE nodes and thus effect fast dynamic provisioning with the 
  minimal crossover time. 
        
  The main concept is to partition a large network into several small 
  networks to configure the path computing information to each small 
  network. This is one of the major functionalities of the PCE nodes, 
  which effectively partitions the addressed domain into respective 
  PCEDAs using the three functional blocks, the Network Processor, 
  Domain Processor and Node Processor [2]. PCEDAs are chosen according 
  to network provisioning such as physical layer conditioning, call 
  demands or QoS demands, which may arise from the user. The following 
  shows a segment wise PCEDA architecture, with the PCE nodes managing 
  the different domain areas.

       Figure 6: PCEMP message exchanges between L1 VPN peers (PE/P)

  For a single PE-P per VPN connection, we can use PCEMP messaging for
  implementing the L1 VPN framework using PCE techniques. Here is a 
  sample sequence of messaging that helps in the L1 VPN PE/P nodes 
  maintain soft PCEMP status. Details about the protocol messages can
  be found in [2]. 

  (1): Send a PCEMP Common Header with the COMPUTE_PATH enabled in the
       PCEMode field and the ACK REQUESTED enabled in the PCEFlag field. 
       The PCEMP message MAY include a PCE SUBOBJECT to inform the 
       responder (P) about the initiator's (PE) 
       PCEMP-LOCAL-INITIATOR-ADDRESS. In this way the PE is initialized
       with the soft-memory based computation for PCEMP FSMs. 

  (2): P receives this message and is configured with the soft-memory
       based path computation states. (If P does not support this, it
       may be needed to be configured administratively). It sends back
       an ACK message to the PE with the responder's (P)
       PCEMP-LOCAL-RESPONDER-ADDRESS

  (3): PE sends a PCEMP Common Header with the ESTABLISH_PATH enabled
       in the PCEMode field and the Peer-to-peer mode set in the 
       PCEStatus field of the Common Header. It also sends a PCEMP
       ESTABLISH message with the following parameters: 
       
       1. Flag field set to VARIABLE. The MAX_PCE_TIME_FIT is to be
          negotiated as discussed in [2]. In case this is not able to 
          be negotiated, then the PCEMP ERROR message SHOULD be 
          generated with the ERROR CODE field set to OUT OF TIME, and
          the PE node MUST issue a fresh PCEMP ESTABLISH message with
          the Flag field set to STATIC. 

       2. The BANDWIDTH OBJECT is mandatory for the PCEMP Common
          Header with the Peer-to-peer mode set in the PCEStatus field.
          If this object is absent, a PCEMP ERROR message MUST be 


Choi, Guha                    Informational                   [Page 13]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt     March 2006


          generated with the ERROR CODE field set to PROTOCOL ERROR
          along with its' supported bandwidth in the PCEMP NEGOTIATE
          OBJECT, following which the initiator requests a fresh
          PCEMP ESTABLISH message with the BANDWIDTH OBJECT equal to 
          the PCEMP NEGOTIATE OBJECT.

  (4): P sends a PCEMP RESPOND message with the corresponding PCE
       Descriptor ID. This is matched and stored statically for the
       lifetime of the path computation between P-PE so that this ID
       remains static between them till the path computation is over.
       If the PCE Descriptor ID changes value, a PCEMP ERROR message
       MUST be generated with the ERROR CODE field set to PROTOCOL 
       ERROR with its own saved PCE Descriptor ID of the wronged hop
       in the PCEMP NEGOTIATE OBJECT. It MUST also set the Protection
       mode in the PCEStatus field of the corresponding outgoing 
       PCEMP Common Header. 

  (5): PE issues a PCEMP TEARDOWN message with the RequestType field 
       set to CHANGE IN COMPUTATION STYLE for PE to remain PCEMP
       enabled and the path computation state active. The L1 VPN
       peers thus maintain their path computation enable for the
       architecture framework as discussed earlier in this draft. 

  (6): P sends a PCEMP Common Header with the COMPUTE_PATH enabled in 
       the PCEMode field. The PCEMP message MAY include a PCE 
       SUBOBJECT to inform the responder (PE) about the initiator's 
       (P) PCEMP-LOCAL-INITIATOR-ADDRESS.

   This follows from Section 5.6.1, with (1A), (2A), (3A), (4A) 
   being identical to (1), (2), (3) and (4). (5) and (6) are also 
   identical as in the previous section. The only point of study is

   the path computation state of PE2. The Teardown message may be 
   propagated to PE2, like the Establish and the Respond messages, 
   in which case it is trivial to the PE-P case. In Figure 7, PE2
   still remains in the active state, i.e. it is capable of generating
   PCEMP messages on its own. The Path Computation state of PE2 is 
   local to it, and is completely independent of what happens at PE1. 
   This is a very big advantage in realizing PCE based L1 per VPNs. 
   PE2 can alternately serve the next PCEDA using the path computation
   state information of PE1 learnt through processes (1), (2), (3) and
   (4). This means that there is always a guaranteed virtual topology 
   link from PE1 to the other PEs, which means that L1 VPN
   provisioning is also guaranteed.

   In this case, path computation states are preserved among all the
   participating entities. P here would ideally act as the PCE node
   initiator for multiple PCEDAs (multi-layer networks in particular)
   and multiple TE-LSPs shared by different paths between different
   L1 VPN peers. The advantage of this is superior path protection
   and bandwidth utilization. 

5.6.4 Inter-domain point-to-multipoint considerations

   The protocol implementations are followed as in the previous section,
   except for a few modifications. 

   Before Step (3) as in 5.6.1, the PE node needs to send a PCEMP 
   Common Header with the COMPUTE_LSP_TYPE set in the PCEMode and the 
   Peer-to-peer mode set to either 0, 1 or 2 in the PCEStatus, as in [2].
   This precedes Step (3) in 5.6.1. The PE node MUST also send a 
   BANDWIDTH OBJECT in the corresponding PCEMP ESTABLISH message, the
   absence of which signifies a protocol error. The participating PCE 
   peers thus get information that the path computation session is a 
   point-to-multipoint one. If the BANDWIDTH OBJECT is not supported, 
   the corresponding peer MAY generate a PCEMP ERROR message with a 
   PCEMP NEGOTIATE OBJECT and the BANDWIDTH OBJECT identical to each

   other. The paths may even be aggregated for multipoint-to-multipoint 
   TE LSP path computation in inter-domains.

   In this mode of operation, Step (6) in 5.6.1 is replaced with the P
   (or Pn, in the more general case) sending a PCEMP Common Header 
   with the COMPUTE_LSP_TYPE enabled in the PCEMode field and the 
   Peer-to-peer mode set along with the BANDWIDTH OBJECT. The BANDWIDTH
   OBJECT should be retained across inter-domain LSPs.


6. Overview of PCE node requirements for dynamic L1 VPN provisioning

  The architecture of the PCEMP protocol using soft memory concepts 
  in the context of path computing block requirements is the key
  factor for dynamic provisioning in Layer 1 VPNs. The network graph 
  is constructed and analyzed real time inside the core of the PCE 
  node with the aid of soft decision algebraic polynomial algorithms. 
  The system is robust and guarantees efficient path computation for 
  large scale data vectors and handle efficient segmentation of 
  inter-domains and inter-layer networks into PCEDAs during path 
  computation, thus effectively realizing the per VPN peer model. 
  It also reduces computational complexity of data intensive 
  processing.

  The requirements of a PCE node that helps to ease computationally 
  intensive data processing for integrated provisioning in 
  inter-domain and inter-layer networks have been discussed in 
  Section 5. The PCEMP along with the CC and SPC as part of the PCE 
  node enables an integrated network architecture where each network 
  layer can freely exchange topology and resource information. This 
  allows network performance to be globally optimized across all 
  layers. 

6.1 Protocol level hierarchy architecture on the L1 control plane 

  In an integrated control plane, three levels of functional control 
  hierarchy are mapped into one PCE node in the core of the Network 
  Processing engine and implemented as a single unit. PCEMP thus has a 
  three level control hierarchy, intra-PCE-domain, inter-PCE-domain 
  and external-PCE-domain. This is used to manage the PCEMP peers
  on the integrated network architecture as shown in Figure 3. 
  The functional blocks involved in the PCE node are: the network 
  processor (the network management system with extended 
  functionalities), the domain processor (the network element management 
  system with extended functionalities), and the node processor. These 
  are invoked by the PCEMP state machines and comprise the fundamental 
  protocol level hierarchies on the control plane. In the first level, 
  the network processor acts as an interface between users and all 
  sub-network domains. Its' main functionality is to oversee the 
  provisioning of new connections across multiple sub-networks and to 
  maintain the network-wide topological view by reducing the 


Choi, Guha                    Informational                   [Page 16]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt     March 2006


  computational domains to PCEDAs. The domain processor supervises tasks 
  within a sub-network domain, such as service provisioning and network 
  status monitoring. It handles requests for connection setup and 
  teardown, and computes explicit paths that meet the SLA of each 
  request. The network monitor observes the overall network health and 
  detects failure and repair events. The databases maintained by the 
  domain processor include the domain topology, the domain link state 
  database gathered via the LSA protocol within its domain, and the 
  domain connection database which keeps track of all established 
  connections in the domain. The node processor manages specific 
  functionalities that can be done in a distributed manner at each node, 
  such as overload handling, failure recovery, and status monitoring. 
  It also detects sudden link overloads, conducts a countermeasure and 
  provides rapid protection and restoration capability in times of 
  failure. The databases maintained by the node processor are the local 
  link state and the local connection databases. The local link state 
  is obtained automatically via the neighbor discovery protocol, while 
  the list of local connections is obtained from all connections that 
  traverse the node. These are implemented using soft memory concepts 
  and synchronized using PCEMP. 

  For the purpose of establishing a guaranteed a disjoint backup path 
  and fast restoration techniques in the participating PCEDAs, it is 
  essential that the large scale data processing in the CC and SPC have 
  minimum overhead and processing delay. The CC manages the entire 
  domain network, as discussed in [2]. In this architecture, backup 
  paths can be easily established end-to-end using the logical 
  configuration in the SPCs using PCEMP. Based on the data driven 
  routing metric table, which is configured at each PCE node by the CC, 
  one can make a robust real-time path between a source node and a 
  destination node and many intermediate nodes between the two. This 
  is done using soft decision PCEMP algorithms.

  All this is used for dynamic L1 VPN provisioning.


6.2 PCEMP peer architecture as seen by the PCEMP protocol

  These are the PCEMP peer architectures as seen by the PCEMP protocol 
  state machines during path computation. From Figure 5, we see that
  the participating nodes in the integrated network for L1 VPN topology
  become corresponding PCEMP peers.  

  1. A matrix and parallel vector arithmetic unit that provides 
  parallel data processing capabilities on the commonly used matrix and 
  vector mathematical data types. Performance of this unit is 
  independent of the size of the data vector under computation. This is 
  implemented in the CC and SPC. 

  2. The processing core that provides the ease of programming and 
  flexibility to address changing algorithms and standards. There 
  exists a one-to-one map from the transform computed by the core to 
  the high-level code generated by the PCE application. This is 
  implemented using soft memory techniques in the CC, SPC and SCM.  


Choi, Guha                    Informational                   [Page 17]

Internet Draft     draft-choi-pce-l1vpn-framework-04.txt     March 2006


  3. A high-speed I/O system that allows complex, adaptive algorithms 
  to be partitioned cost-effectively across multiple sub PCE unit 
  blocks by providing dual ports. These ports are logically 
  indistinguishable across the ordered pair of a data vector and the 
  corresponding transform that is executed. 

  These units are images of the PCE computing unit that are mapped onto
  the PCEMP state machines and thus make all the participating entities
  PCEMP supportive.

7.  Conclusion

  We have shown that a path computation technique based architecture
  might be a good solution towards dynamic L1 provisioning in per
  VPN peer based service models. There is perfect synchronization 
  of resource information between PCEMP peers using the PCEMP DS [2]. 
  
  This draft addresses L1 VPN frameworks from the PCE perspective which
  is a relatively new way of describing such an architecture. In this 
  context, PCEMP helps to realize this motivation of the peer service 
  model. Resource management level granularity is mapped onto using
  PCEMP DS [2].

  Traffic Engineering and protocol performance under stress remain
  topics of future study.

8. Security Considerations

  The impact of the use of the PCEMP architecture is relatively much 
  secure as the PCEDA are computed and distributed internal to the PCE 
  unit. An increase in inter-domain information flows and the facilitation 
  of inter-domain path establishment through PCEMP does not increase the 
  existing vulnerability to security attacks. It should be remembered that
  PCEMP works by an invoked logic scheme local to each participating PCE 
  unit, and the protocol scheme is brought into play only when there is a 
  significant change in the data profile within the time of goodness of fit.

  However, it is expected that the PCE solutions will address security
  issues mentioned in [Ash] in details using authentication and 
  security techniques.
