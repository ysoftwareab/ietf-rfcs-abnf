             draft-sarikaya-behave-mext-nat64-dsmip-02.txt

Abstract

   This memo specifies modifications required to the home agent to
   integrate NAT64 with Mobile IP so that IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN)
   receiving host-based mobility management using Dual Stack Mobile IPv6
   (DSMIPv6) can communicate with IPv4 only servers.  The protocol is
   based on home agents maintaining a table similar to NAT64 and linking
   it to the binding cache.  The changes include better keepalive
   management in order to preserve battery on the mobile node as well as
   multicast support for NAT64 integrated into the current multicast
   support scheme in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 so that IPv6 only mobile
   nodes can receive multicast data from IPv4 only content providers.

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               January 2011


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  NAT64 together with DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] enables IPv6-only hosts to communicate
   with IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 is designed for fixed hosts.  When used for mobile nodes
   several problems occur as described in
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].  In this document we
   redesign NAT64 for host based mobility protocol called Dual Stack
   Mobile IPv6.  The design uses DNS64 as is and integrates NAT64
   operation with the binding cache of Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.

   The document continues in Section 3 with a set of requirements on a
   solution for NAT64 for Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  In Section 4 the
   protocol design is presented, multicast translation is explained in
   Section 5 while handover and route optimization cases are covered in
   Section 6.  In Section 7 extensions to DSMIPv6 are described.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3775], [RFC5555],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate],
   [RFC6052] and [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].


3.  Requirements

   NAT64 has two main problems if used for the mobile nodes: the first
   one is related to mobility and the second one is related to NAT
   keepalives.

   DNS64 uses the IPv6 prefix assigned to the NAT64 IPv6 interface in
   the domain in translating IPv4 address of the server to an IPv6
   address.  This prefix will be referred to as Pref64 as in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  [RFC6052] defines two types
   of prefixes: Well-Known Prefix or Network-Specific Prefix.  If the
   well-known prefix of 64:FF9B::/96 is used then the mobile node would
   always get the same mapping wherever it moves so no problems can be
   anticipated.  However, for various reasons this is not expected to be
   the case in general.

   If Network-Specific Prefixes (NSP) are used problems can be
   anticipated especially for mobile nodes



Sarikaya & Xia            Expires July 29, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               January 2011


   [I-D.korhonen-behave-nat64-learn-analysis].  This happens because
   DNS64 server used by the mobile node may use a different NSP that
   NAT64 box is not configured with.

   When the mobile node moves to a foreign network, the mobile node's
   DNS requests can be done in two ways: either mobile node tunnels it
   to the home agent and the home agent sends it to the DNS server in
   the home network or the mobile node sends it locally and it goes to
   the DNS server of the foreign network.  The former case poses no
   problems as DNS64 server is synchronized with NAT64 server at the
   home network.  The latter case poses problems because NSP in the IPv6
   address synthesized by the local DNS64 is not recognized by the home
   NAT64 server, i.e. its interface is not configured with this NSP.  In
   this case the mobile node's IPv6 packet may not reach the destination
   IPv4-only server.  This is called prefix mismatch problem.

   Mobile nodes in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 initiate route optimization
   with the correspondent nodes when they move to a foreign network by
   sending first a home test init (HoTI) message to the home agent.
   This and subsequent messages (Care-of Test Init (CoTI), Home Test
   (HoT) and Care-of Test (CoT)) contain IPv6 extension headers.
   NAT64's translation algorithm [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate IPv6 extension headers.  As a result, HoTI and similar
   messages would be rejected at the NAT64 device and the mobile node
   would end up receiving an ICMP message.

   This fundamental restriction of IPv6-IPv4 translation is avoided in
   this document by an additional requirement not to initiate the route
   optimization with IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 is a NAT device which keeps NAT table as the NAT state.  NAT
   state is soft state and it expires if it is not refreshed during a
   certain time interval.  NAT devices delete existing bindings at the
   end of a time interval if no activity is detected during that
   interval.  Timer values of a minimum of two and maximum of five
   minutes for UDP [RFC4787] and 2 hours and four minutes [RFC2663] for
   TCP [RFC5382] are recommended [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].
   However, existing NAT devices are known to have non-deterministic and
   typically short expiration times especially for UDP-based bindings.

   Outbound refresh (mobile node initiated) is necessary for allowing
   the client (mobile node) to keep the mapping alive.  NAT keepalives
   are used for this purpose [RFC5245].  Mobile nodes go to sleep mode
   when inactive in which battery usage is minimized.  However sending
   NAT keepalive messages for outbound refresh may drain the mobile
   node's battery because it has to cut short its sleep mode.

   NAT keepalives should be avoided for the mobile nodes.  This

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               January 2011


   requirement is met by integrating NAT64 state with binding cache that
   the home agent creates for the mobile node in order to keep track of
   its mobility and by having the home agent to refresh NAT binding with
   the NAT device.

   While resolving issues of NAT64 related to mobility, it is desirable
   to keep compatibility with fixed hosts.  This requirement is met by
   reusing DNS64 for mobile nodes as well.

   The behaviour of IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes using host
   based mobility protocol Mobile IPv6 is specified in [RFC5555].
   However [RFC5555] does not specify how IPv6-only mobile nodes can
   access IPv4-only servers.  Hence this specification complements
   [RFC5555].

   NAT64 is designed for unicast communication, the translation
   algorithm is defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate multicast packets.  IPv6 only hosts receiving multicast
   data from IPv4 only servers is not covered.

   For many applications multicast communication for mobile nodes in a
   dual stack Mobile IPv6 environment is a requirement.  This
   requirement is met by designing a multicast translation scheme for
   Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  This technique applies to any source
   multicast (ASM) as well as Source Specific Multicast (SSM).


4.  Modifications to DSMIPv6 for NAT64

   This section discusses extensions to NAT64 to support mobility.
   Multicast extensions are discussed next in Section 5.  It is assumed
   that NAT64 and HA can be hosted in different machines, however it is
   also possible that HA and NAT64 coexist in the same node.

   Mobile nodes reverse tunnel their packets to the home agent when
   roaming and at the home network the home agent is the default router.
   When forwarding packets sent by the mobile node, the home agent first
   checks the Source Address field of the inner header in the binding
   cache to find the corresponding binding cache entry for this mobile
   node's home address.  A further check is made if the destination
   address' prefix matches Pref64 in the prefix table.  In case of a
   match, IPv6-only flag in the binding cache entry for the mobile node
   is set if it was not set already.

   If NAT64 and HA are collocated, HA creates a "NAT state" of

   <MN source address, IPv6 source port> <--> <IPv4 Interface address,
   IPv4 source port>



Sarikaya & Xia            Expires July 29, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               January 2011


   To this NAT state this specification adds keepalive interval K which
   is used to make sure HA/NAT64 initiates NAT64 keepalives.  MN does
   not have to shorten the time it spends in dormant state and drain its
   battery.

   Translation into IPv4 packet takes place at the NAT64 server.  If
   NAT64 server is collocated then the home agent translates IPv6 packet
   into an IPv4 packet following the algorithm presented in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].

   HA (collocated with NAT64 or not) keeps IPv6-only flag and Pref64 in
   the binding cache.  This state is linked to the binding cache entry
   for MN.  The home agent forwards IPv6 packet towards NAT64 server.

   When forwarding any subsequent packets for the same session
   corresponding to <MN source address, source port>, HA collocated with
   NAT64 finds the corresponding entry in the NAT table and creates the
   corresponding IPv4 packet using this entry.  The above procedure of
   new NAT64 state creation is repeated only when a new session is
   started by MN.

   In case of collocated HA and NAT64, an incoming IPv4 packet is
   processed as follows: When HA receives a packet addressed to its IPv4
   interface it searches the NAT table for the corresponding MN IPv6
   source address and port.  For example the tuple <203.0.113.1, 2000>
   would match the network-specific prefix (NSP) of 2001:FF00::/64 and
   the source port of 1500.  HA creates an IPv6 packet from IPv4 packet
   using this information.  IPv4 packet is translated into an IPv6
   packet following the algorithm presented in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].  Next HA fetches MN's binding cache
   entry and finds care-of address of MN.  HA encapsulates IPv6 packet
   and sends it to the mobile node.

   If HA and NAT64 are not collocated, NAT64 translates IPv4 packet and
   forwards to HA as IPv6 packet.  HA, after receiving the incoming IPv6
   packet to the mobile node's home network, searches its binding cache
   and finds care-of address of MN and encapsulates the packet and sends
   it to MN.

   Keepalive interval is used to send NAT keepalive messages when HA is
   collocated with NAT64.  NAT keepalive messages are ICMP Echo Request
   messages [RFC3519].  ICMPv6 Echo Request message MUST be encoded with
   a UDP header.  The packet's destination address is the destination
   address associated with the keepalive interval.  The source address
   is MN's home address.  Keepalive interval is used to keep track of
   inactivity of the mobile node's session with its NAT64 host, IPv4-
   only server.  UDP header contains the source and destination port
   numbers of NAT64 binding.  Any ICMP Echo Request message sent from



Sarikaya & Xia            Expires July 29, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               January 2011


   the home agent serves as outbound refresh message for the session and
   any corresponding ICMP Echo Reply received serves as the inbound
   refresh.

   ICMPv6 Echo Request message encoded in UDP header is translated into
   ICMPv4 Echo Request message with UDP header at NAT64 server following
   translation rules defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] since the
   UDP header preserves the source and destination port numbers that are
   needed in order to match with NAT64 binding.  NAT64 server also
   refreshes NAT64 state for this session.  An ICMPv4 Echo is sent to
   IPv4 only server as an IPv4 packet with UDP header.  IPv4 server
   replies with IPv4 Echo Reply which is translated into ICMPv6 Echo
   Reply message and received by the home agent.

   Keepalive interval of K seconds controls the frequency of keepalive
   messages.  K is a protocol constant with a default value.  The
   default value should be less that the timeout value used by the NAT
   server.  Because of this K can be set to the default value of 110
   seconds [RFC3519].

   Home agent collocated with NAT64 forwards any subsequent packets for
   the same session corresponding to <MN source address, source port>
   and refreshes the keepalive interval.  Home agent does not do any
   inbound refresh.  Home agent MUST not forward ICMPv6 Echo Reply
   message to MN.  Incoming packets for this session do not refresh the
   keepalive interval since it is the interval for outbound refresh.  It
   is up to IPv4 only server to do the inbound refreshes.


5.  Multicast Translation

   In this section we specify how mobile node can receive IPv4 multicast
   data from IPv4-only content provider based on the current multicast
   support scheme in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].  The reverse
   translation of IPv6 multicast data for IPv4-only receivers is out of
   scope.  Multicast translation specified in this section applies to
   both cases of collocated HA and NAT64 as well as HA and NAT64 hosted
   in different machines.

   IPv6-only mobile node will join IPv4 multicast group by sending MLD
   Membership Report message to the home agent.  This message is sent in
   the mobile node-home agent tunnel.  Mobile node will use synthesized
   IPv6 address of IPv4 multicast group address, e.g. a /96 prefix used
   for any source multicast called IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix followed by
   a.b.c.d, IPv4 multicast group address.  IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix
   takes the form of FFxx::/96, it is non-SSM prefix
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].  Multicast router at the home agent
   receives this join message from the mobile node for the group

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               January 2011


   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d.

   Each home agent is assigned a unique IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.
   Mobile nodes can learn this value by means out of scope with this
   document.  With this, mobile node can easily create an IPv6 multicast
   address from the IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that it wants to join.

   Home agent as multicast anchor checks the group address and
   recognizes IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  It next checks the last 32
   bits is an IPv4 multicast address in range 224/8 - 239/8.  If all
   checks succeed, home agent joins a.b.c.d using IGMP on its IPv4
   interface.

   Home agent identifies the mobile node from the tunnel and adds the
   multicast group address to the multicast state associated with the
   mobile node's binding cache entry.  Home agent also sets IPv6-only
   bit if it was not set before.

   When home agent receives multicast data for the group a.b.c.d, it
   first obtains the IPv6 address IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and
   then checks to see if at least one mobile node is subscribed to this
   address from the binding cache and multicast state.

   Home agent will then translate IPv4 multicast data packet into an
   IPv6 multicast data packet.  The destination address is IPv6 group
   address IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and source address is home
   agent's IPv6 interface address.  The value in Type of Service (TOS)
   field of IPv4 packet is copied into IPv6 Traffic Class field.  IPv4
   Protocol and TTL fields are copied into IPv6 Next Header and Hop
   Limit fields respectively.  IPv4 payload is copied into IPv6 payload.
   UDP checksum is updated which completes the packet translation
   process [Thesis].  Home agent duplicates the packet for each mobile
   node member of this group and sends each packet tunneled to the
   individual mobile node separately.

   Any IPv4 fragments sent by the routers must be translated into IPv6
   packets with IPv6 Fragment Header.  Fragmentation Offset field is
   copied into the corresponding field in the Fragment Header. 16-bit
   Identification field is copied into the low-order 16 bits of IPv6
   Fragment Header Identification field.  The high-order bits of the 32-
   bit IPv6 Fragment Header Identification field are set to zero.  More
   Fragments (MF) flag is copied to the corresponding field in IPv6
   Fragment Header [Thesis].

   Multicast translation described in this section is not mobile node
   agnostic.  Home agent gets the join message directly from the mobile
   node and then updates the membership database which is connected to
   the binding cache.  Home agent has to know all members of each IPv4

   group so that it can correctly duplicate the data packets and tunnel
   to individual mobile nodes.

   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) can also be supported similar to the
   Any Source Multicast (ASM) described above.  In case of SSM, IPv4
   multicast addresses use 232.0.0.0/8 prefix and IPv6 multicast
   addresses use FF3X::/96 prefix.  A unique SSM prefix can be
   configured such as FF3E::/96.  This prefix is referred to as
   IPV6_TRSSM_ADDRESS prefix.  Since SSM translation requires a unique
   address for each IPv4 multicast source, an IPv6 unicast prefix must
   be configured to the translator to represent IPv4 sources.  This
   prefix is prepended to IPv4 source addresses in translated packets.
   Also this prefix must be routed towards the translator on the IPv6
   network, to enable reverse path forwarding for multicast, and to
   inform other PIM routers about the correct destination for PIM (S,G)
   Join messages [Thesis].


6.  Handover, Route Optimization and Return Routability

   The mobile node moves to a foreign network and sends DNS request
   locally and the request goes to the DNS server of the foreign network
   that is configured with a different Pref64.  This creates a prefix
   mismatch problem.  Mobile node gets a different synthetic AAAA RR
   with a different IPv6 address of the destination.  MN reverse tunnels
   its IPv6 packet destined to IPv4-only server to the home agent.

   Home agent checks the source address (mobile node's home address) of
   the inner header in the binding cache for any entry with IPv6-only
   flag set.  Next destination address' prefix is checked in the binding
   cache.  In case the prefix does not match, HA checks the prefix table
   for a match with the destination address' prefix.  In case of a
   match, a new binding cache entry is added with the new Pref64.  HA is
   responsible for routing the MN's packet with the new Pref64.  The
   packet may take a longer path or the packet may not even reach the
   destination due to a non existing roaming agreement with the foreign
   network.  If the prefix does not match, home agent forwards the
   packet since this packet should be going to another IPv6 destination
   host.

   If IPv6-only flag is not set and the prefix matches then this is the
   first packet sent to a new IPv4-only server.  Home agent processes
   this packet as described in Section 4.

   The effect of handover on multicast translation described in
   Section 5 depends on how IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix is configured.
   Mobile node may get a different IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix locally
   after moving to a foreign network.  Mobile node sends a join request

   (Multicast Listener Discovery Report message) with a new multicast
   group address to the home agent in a tunnel.  Home agent adds this
   group address to its membership database.  Home agent MUST add the
   new IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix to the multicast prefix table.  Home
   agent MUST set IPv6-only flag in the binding cache for this mobile
   node.

   Route optimization (RO) in DSMIPv6 is used to avoid triangular route
   every packet to the corresponding node takes by enabling the mobile
   node to directly send the packets to the correspondent node
   [RFC3775].  RO is established using control signaling involving the
   home agent, mobile node and correspondent node.  After RO is
   established mobile node sends its packets directly to the
   correspondent node.  The source address of these packets is the
   care-of address and MN home address is included in an extension
   header called home address option.  All RO packets involve extension
   headers.

   Because all route optimization packets (signaling and data) contain
   extension headers the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] used in NAT64 would simply ignore the
   data included in these headers.  As a result, route optimization can
   not even be initiated.  IPv6 only mobile nodes involved in
   communication with IPv4-only servers MUST NOT use route optimization.
   This ensures that all traffic between the mobile node and
   corresponding node goes through the home agent and correct IPv6-IPv4
   packet translation can be conducted.


7.  Extensions to  Dual Stack Mobile IPv6

   Binding cache entry contains the following new entry:

   A flag indicating whether or not this mobile node is IPv6-only node
   and Pref64, the prefix used to route NAT64 traffic to NAT64 server.

   IPv6-only flag is set after receiving the first IPv6 packet
   containing a synthetic IPv6 address.  This flag is used to connect
   the binding cache with the NAT table.

   Home agent is configured with a table of NAT64 prefixes, Pref64's
   that are supported in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 home domain and its
   roaming partners.  For each Pref64, home agent keeps a 32-bit suffix
   which is concatenated to the prefix.  The resulting 96-bit value is
   concatenated with IPv4 address of the destination IPv4-only server to
   obtain the synthesized IPv6 address.

   If the Well-Known Prefix is used this table contains 64:FF9B::/96.

   In this case there is no associated suffix.

   IPv6-only mobile nodes MUST avoid initiating return routability
   procedure described in Section 5.2.5 of [RFC3775].  When the home
   agent receives a Home Test Init message, it checks the source address
   (mobile node's home address) in the binding cache.  If the
   corresponding binding cache entry has its IPv6-only flag set home
   agent drops the Home Test Init message.

7.1.  Multicast Extensions

   Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST support at least one
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST
   support IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Home agent has a table of IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefixes.  This table
   normally contains a single entry, i.e. the local prefix value.  It
   may be populated by more entries in case of handover as described in
   Section 6.  The entries are kept as soft-state and removed after a
   period of no activity.

   Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST support at least one
   IPV6_TRSSM_ADDRESS prefix.  Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST
   support IGMPv3 on its IPv4 interface as source filtering needed for
   SSM is supported only by IGMPv3.


8.  Protocol Constants

   K 110 seconds (as defined in [RFC3519].


9.  Security Considerations

   For IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes security considerations
   stated in [RFC5555] apply.  This document specifies procedures for
   MIPv6 [RFC3775] for the case of IPv6-only mobile nodes which are not
   covered in [RFC5555].  Security considerations for IPv4 interface of
   the home agent is similar to [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and the considerations stated there apply.


10.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
