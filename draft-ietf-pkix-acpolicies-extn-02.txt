Abstract

This document describes one certificate extension to explicitly 
state the Attribute Certificate (AC) policies that apply to a given 
Attribute Certificate.

Conventions Used In This Document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1. Introduction

When issuing a PKC, a Certificate Authority (CA) can perform various 
levels of verification with regard to the subject identity.  A CA makes 
its verification procedures, as well as other operational rules it 
abides by, "visible" through a certificate policy, which may be 
referenced by a certificate policies extension in the PKC.

The purpose of this document is to define such an extension, but not 
the AC policies themselves.

2. AC Policy Extension Semantics

Attribute Certificates are defined in [RFC3281].

An Attribute Certificate Policy (ACP) is a set of rules that indicates 
generic rules for registering, verifying, delivering and revoking the 
attributes contained in a particular Attribute Certificate.

It should thus be noticed that an AA does not necessarily support one 
single policy. However, for each AC that is delivered it SHALL make 
sure that the policy applies to all the attributes that are contained 
in it.

An Attribute Certificate Policy may be used by a certificate user to 
decide whether or not to trust the attributes contained in a 
certificate for a particular purpose.

When a certificate contains an AC policies extension, the extension 
MAY, at the option of the certificate issuer, be either critical or 
non-critical. 

The AC Policies extension MAY be included in an attribute certificate.
Like all X.509 certificate extensions, the AC policies extension is 
defined using ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88]. 

The AC policies extension is identified by id-aca-acPolicies.

     id-aca-acPolicies OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-aca 7 <<TBC>> }

The AC policies extension includes a list of AC policies recognized by 
the issuing authority that apply to the attributes included in the 
certificate.

AC Policies may be defined by any organization with a need.  Object 
identifiers used to identify AC Policies are assigned in accordance 
with [ITU-T Rec. X660 | ISO/IEC 9834-1].

The presence of this extension in an attribute certificate indicates 
the AC policies for which the attribute certificate is valid.

An application that recognizes this extension and its content SHALL 
process the extension regardless of the value of the criticality flag. 

If the extension is both flagged non-critical and is not recognized, 
then the application MAY ignore it. 

If the extension is flagged critical or is recognized, it indicates 
that the attributes contained in the certificate SHALL only be used 
for the purpose, and in accordance with the rules implied by one of 
the indicated AC policies.



Francis, Pinkas                                                  Page 2


Internet-Draft              AC Policy extension           February 2003


If the extension is marked critical or is recognized, certificate 
users MUST use the list of AC policies to determine whether it is 
appropriate to use the attributes contained in that certificate for 
a particular transaction. 

2.1 AC Policy Extension Syntax

The syntax for the AC Policy extension is:

acPolicies EXTENSION ::= {
     SYNTAX              acPoliciesSyntax
     IDENTIFIED BY       id-aca-acPolicies}

acPoliciesSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF PolicyInformation

PolicyInformation ::= SEQUENCE {
      policyIdentifier      acPolicyId,
      policyQualifiers      SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF 
                                     PolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL}

acPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   PolicyQualifierInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        policyQualifierId  PolicyQualifierId,
        qualifier          ANY DEFINED BY policyQualifierId }

To promote interoperability, this document RECOMMENDS that policy 
information terms consist of only an OID. When more than one policy 
is used, the policy requirements have to be non conflicting, e.g. one 
policy may refine the general requirements mandated by another policy.

2.2 Attribute Certificate Policies

The scope of this document is not the definition of the detailed 
content of Attribute Certificate policies themselves, therefore 
specific policies are not defined in this document. 

2.3. Generic Policy Qualifiers

   This specification defines two generic policy qualifier types for 
   use by certificate policy writers and certificate issuers, which 
   are similar to those used for Certificate Policies in Public Key 
   Certificates.  The qualifier types are the CPS Pointer and User 
   Notice qualifiers.

   The CPS Pointer qualifier contains a pointer to a Certification
   Practice Statement (CPS) published by the AA.  The pointer is in 
   the form of a URI.

   User notice is intended for display to a relying party when a
   certificate is used.  The application software SHOULD display all
   user notices in all certificates of the certification path used,
   except that if a notice is duplicated only one copy need be

Francis, Pinkas                                                  Page 3


Internet-Draft              AC Policy extension           February 2003

   displayed.  To prevent such duplication, this qualifier SHOULD only
   be present in end-entity certificates.

These policies Qualifiers are defined in [RFC3280].

   -- policyQualifierIds for Internet policy qualifiers

   id-qt          OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-pkix 2 }
   id-qt-cps      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-qt 1 }
   id-qt-unotice  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-qt 2 }

3. Security Considerations

The Attribute Certification Policy defined in this document applies 
for all the attributes that are included in one AC. AAs shall make sure 
that the policy applies to all the attributes which are included in the 
certificates they issue. 

Attributes may be dynamically grouped in several ACs. It should be 
observed that since the management of some attributes may be different, 
different policies  may be used by 
the same AA.
