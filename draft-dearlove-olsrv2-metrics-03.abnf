Type == SYMMETRIC is present, but to represent only routing MPR
n = k+1.

R_dest_addr == current address, then add a Routing Tuple
R_metric == (R_metric of the previous Tuple) + T_metric,
R_dist == h+1, and the Neighbor Tuple corresponding to the
R_metric == (R_metric of the previous Tuple) + AN_metric,
