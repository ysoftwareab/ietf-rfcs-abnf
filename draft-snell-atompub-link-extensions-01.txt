Internet-Draft            Atom Link Extensions             December 2005


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines extensions to the Atom Syndication Format
   [RFC4287] link and content elements that may be used to express
   additional metadata about linked resources.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

   {Ed.  Note: this namespace MUST be changed to a proper IETF namespace
   scheme prior to publication}

    "le": "http://purl.org/atompub/link-extensions/1.0"


3.  Entity Attributes

   The following link Entity Attributes may be used to specify metadata
   about the resource referenced by an atom:link element or atom:content
   element using the 'src' attribute.  The attributes are designed to
   closely correlate with existing HTTP [RFC2616] mechanisms used to
   perform conditional operations, detecting resource modifications and
   requesting ranges.

3.1.  The 'md5' Attribute

   The 'md5' Attribute specifies a Base64-encoded MD5 digest [RFC1864]
   of the resource identified by the atom:link/@href or atom:content/@
   src attributes.  The value of the digest is calculated as specified
   in [RFC2616] and [RFC1864].  The 'md5' attribute MAY appear as a
   child of the atom:link and atom:content (using the 'src' attribute)
   elements.

     md5 = attribute le:md5 { md5-digest }

     md5-digest   = <base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864>

   While MD5 digests are not a guarantee against malicious modifications
   of a resource, the digest specified may be used as a simple integrity
   check to verify whether or not the referenced resource may have been

   modified.

   An example MD5 digest of an enclosed MP3 file

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       le:md5="Q2hlY2sgSW50ZWdyaXR5IQ==" />

3.2.  The 'etag' Attribute

   The 'etag' Attribute specifies an Entity Tag [RFC2616] for the
   resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element.  The
   'etag' attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:
   content (using the 'src' attribute) elements.

     etag = attribute le:etag { entity-tag }

     entity-tag = [ weak ] opaque-tag
     weak       = "W/"
     opaque-tag = quoted-string

   As specified by [RFC2616], Entity Tags are usable for the purpose of
   comparing multiple entities served from the same resource URI and are
   typically used in the context of conditional-retrievals of resource
   representations.

   An example Entity Tag for an enclosed MP3 file

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       le:etag="W/xyzzy" />

3.3.  The 'last-modified' Attribute

   The 'last-modified' Attribute specifies the date and time when the
   resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element was last
   modified as specified by [RFC2616].  The value of the attribute must
   conform to the HTTP-date construct from [RFC2616].  The 'last-
   modified' attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:
   content (using the 'src' attribute) elements.

     last-modified = attribute le:last-modified { HTTP-date }

     HTTP-date    = rfc1123-date | rfc850-date | asctime-date
     rfc1123-date = wkday "," SP date1 SP time SP "GMT"
     rfc850-date  = weekday "," SP date2 SP time SP "GMT"
     asctime-date = wkday SP date3 SP time SP 4DIGIT
     date1        = 2DIGIT SP month SP 4DIGIT
                    ; day month year (e.g., 02 Jun 1982)
     date2        = 2DIGIT "-" month "-" 2DIGIT
                    ; day-month-year (e.g., 02-Jun-82)
     date3        = month SP ( 2DIGIT | ( SP 1DIGIT ))
                    ; month day (e.g., Jun  2)
     time         = 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT
                    ; 00:00:00 - 23:59:59
     wkday        = "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed"
                  | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat" | "Sun"
     weekday      = "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday"
                  | "Thursday" | "Friday" | "Saturday" | "Sunday"
     month        = "Jan" | "Feb" | "Mar" | "Apr"
                  | "May" | "Jun" | "Jul" | "Aug"
                  | "Sep" | "Oct" | "Nov" | "Dec"

   An example last-modified attribute for an enclosed MP3 file

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       le:last-modified="Tue, 29 Nov 2005 20:37:00 PST" />

3.4.  The 'range' Attribute

   The 'range' Attribute specifies a subset of the resource identified
   by the atom:link or atom:content element as specified by the standard
   HTTP Range header defined by [RFC2616].  The 'range' attribute MAY
   appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content (using the 'src'
   attribute) elements.

     range = attribute le:range { ranges-specifier }

     ranges-specifier = byte-ranges-specifier
     byte-ranges-specifier = bytes-unit "=" byte-range-set
     byte-range-set  = 1#( byte-range-spec | suffix-byte-range-spec )
     byte-range-spec = first-byte-pos "-" [last-byte-pos]
     first-byte-pos  = 1*DIGIT
     last-byte-pos   = 1*DIGIT

   The only Range Specifier defined by [RFC2616] is the "bytes" range
   specifier used to request a specific sequence of bytes from a
   resource.  Other range specifiers MAY be used.  Unknown range

   specifiers SHOULD be ignored.

   An example range attribute specifying the first 500 bytes of an
   enclosed MP3 file

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       le:range="bytes 0-499" />


4.  Media Descriptors

   Resources referenced by atom:link and atom:content elements may be
   optimized for rendering on specific types of devices.

4.1.  The 'media' Attribute

   The 'media' attribute MAY be used to identify the types of devices
   for which a resource referenced by an atom:link or atom:content
   (using the src attribute) has been targeted.  The definition of the
   media attribute is the same as the 'media' attribute on HTML
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224] and XHTML [W3C.REC-xhtml1-20020801] link
   elements.  The 'media' attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:
   link and atom:content elements.

     media = attribute le:media { media-descriptors }

   The value of the 'media' attribute is a comma separated list of
   media-descriptor tokens.  If not specified, the value of attribute is
   assumed to be "all".  The following lists the standard media-
   descriptor definitions as specified by [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].

       href="http://example.org/a.html"
       le:media="screen" />
     <atom:link rel="alternate"
       href="http://example.org/b.html"
       le:media="handheld" />


5.  Link Grouping and Alternates

   The Link Grouping and Alternate mechanisms defined below make it
   possible to group related atom:link elements into logical sets or to
   identify alternate IRI's (e.g. mirrors) for linked resources.

Internet-Draft            Atom Link Extensions             December 2005


5.1.  The 'group' Attribute

   The 'group' Attribute MAY appear as a child of atom:link elements and
   MAY be used to group associated links together into a logical set of
   mutually-exclusive options.  The value of the attribute is a case-
   insensitive, opaque text string.  Link elements with 'group'
   attributes specifying the same value are considered to belong to the
   same logical set.

     group = attribute le:group { text }

   The following illustrates an example of how the 'group' attribute may
   be used to identify alternate encodings of the same enclosed audio
   content.

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       le:group="mypodcast" />
     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.wma"
       le:group="mypodcast" />

   Comparison operations on the 'group' attribute are performed using a
   case-insensitive character-by-character examination.  Entity
   encodings MUST be interpreted as the character they represent.  For
   instance, The value "group" is equivalent to "group", "Group",
   "GROUP", etc.  The value "&nbsp;" is equivalent to the character
   string " " (that is, an ampersand followed by the characters "nbsp;")
   and MUST NOT be interpreted as markup.

5.2.  The 'alternate' Element

   The 'alternate' Element is used to specify one or more alternative
   IRI's for the resource identified by an atom:link element.  For
   instance, an enclosure referenced by a link may be downloadable from
   multiple mirror locations.  The 'alternate' Element consists of an
   IRI and optional language-sensitive text label.  Zero or more
   'alternate' elements MAY appear as children of the atom:link element.
   The parent link element's 'type', 'length' and 'hreflang' attributes
   are considered to apply equally to each of the contained 'alternate'
   elements.

     alternate = element le:alternate {
      atomCommonAttributes,
      attribute href,
      attribute title?,
      (undefinedContent)
     }

   An example atom:link that specifies two alternate download locations
   for the enclosed MP3 file

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       type="audio/mpeg"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3">
       <le:alternate title="Mirror 1"
         href="http://west.example.org/media/myfile.mp3" />
       <le:alternate title="Mirror 2"
         href="http://east.example.org/media/myfile.mp3" />
     </atom:link>


6.  Link Decoration

6.1.  The 'description' Element

   The 'description' element is an Atom Text Construct that is used to
   associate a short, human-readable textual summary with an atom:link
   element.

     description = element le:description { atomTextConstruct }

   An example atom:link element with an associated description.

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3">
       <le:description type="text">
         My first podcast.  Isn't it great!
       </le:description>
     </atom:link>

6.2.  The 'icon' Element

   The 'icon' element identifies an image that provides an iconic visual
   identification for an atom:link.  Like the standard atom:icon
   element, which is used to associate an icon image with Atom Feed
   Documents, images referenced by the 'icon' element SHOULD have a
   1-to-1 aspect ratio and be suitable for presentation at a small size.
   The element MAY contain an optional 'type' attribute whose value
   specifies the media-type of the referenced icon.

     icon = element le:icon {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute type { media-type }?,
       (atomURI)
     }

7.  Link Relations

   This specification adds the following values to the IANA Registry of
   Link Relations as specified by [RFC4287].

7.1.  Hierarchy Links

   The Hierarchy Link Relations may be used to organize Atom Feed and
   Entry documents into a hierarchical tree.

   o  link[@rel='origin'] : The 'origin' link refers to the logical root
      of a hierarchical tree of entities.
   o  link[@rel='parent'] : The 'parent' link refers to the logical
      parent of the current entity in a hierarchical tree of entities.
   o  link[@rel='child'] : The 'child' link refers to a logical
      subordinate of the current document in a hierarchical tree of
      entities.
   o  link[@rel='sibling'] : The 'sibling' link refers to a logical
      sibling of the current document in a hierarchical tree of
      entities.

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <link rel="origin"
             href="origin.xml" />
       <link rel="parent"
             href="origin.xml" />
       <link rel="sibling"
             href="child_feed_B.xml" />
       <link rel="child"
             href="child_feed_C.xml" />
     </feed>

     <!-- Child Feed C -->
     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <link rel="origin"
             href="origin.xml" />
       <link rel="parent"
             href="child_feed_A.xml" />
     </feed>

7.2.  Informational Links

   The following link relations may be used to reference informational
   resources about the containing Atom Feed or Entry.

   o  link[@rel='help'] : The 'help' link may be used to reference
      resources offering help information for the containing Feed or
      Entry.
   o  link[@rel='about'] : The 'about' link may be used to reference
      resources offering additional information about the containing
      Feed or Entry.

       <link rel="about" type="application/xhtml+xml"
         href="http://example.org/about/feeds" />
       ...
     </feed>


8.  Security Considerations

   While the mechanisms defined herein may be used to detect potentially
   malicious modifications of referenced resources, the mechanisms MUST
   NOT be considered to provide a guarantee against inappropriate
   modification.  Other mechanisms, such as XML Digital Signatures and
   XML Encryption should be used to properly secure Atom documents.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification adds the following registrations to the IANA
   Registry of link relations:

     Attribute Value: origin
     Description: The 'origin' link refers to the logical root
                  of a hierarchical tree of entities.
     Expected display characteristics: none
     Security considerations: As defined in [RFC4287]


     Attribute Value: parent
     Description: The 'parent' link refers to the logical parent
                  of the current entity in a hierarchical tree of
                  entities.
     Expected display characteristics: none
     Security considerations: As defined in [RFC4287]


     Attribute Value: child
     Description: The 'child' link refers to a logical subordinate
                  of the current document in a hierarchical tree
