    Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol For Fast Reroute of
                   Traffic Engineering GMPLS LSPs
             draft-ietf-teas-gmpls-lsp-fastreroute-05


Abstract

   This document defines Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling extensions to support Fast Reroute
   (FRR) of Packet Switched Capable (PSC) Generalized Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  These signaling
   extensions allow the coordination of a bidirectional bypass tunnel
   assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse
   directions of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.  In addition, these
   extensions enable the re-direction of bidirectional traffic and
   signaling onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness of data and
   signaling paths in the forward and reverse directions after FRR to
   avoid RSVP soft-state timeout.

Internet-Draft           FRR for TE GMPLS LSPs              June 3, 2016


   Packet Switched Capable (PSC) Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels are
   signaled using Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   signaling procedures specified in [RFC3473] for both unidirectional
   and bidirectional LSPs.  Fast Reroute (FRR) [RFC4090] has been widely
   deployed in the packet TE networks today and is desirable for TE
   GMPLS LSPs.  Using FRR methods also allows the leveraging of existing
   mechanisms for failure detection and restoration in deployed
   networks.

   The FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] describe the behavior of the
   Point of Local Repair (PLR) to reroute traffic and signaling onto the
   bypass tunnel in the event of a failure for unidirectional LSPs. 
   These procedures are applicable to unidirectional protected LSPs
   signaled using either RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or GMPLS procedures
   [RFC3473], but they do not address issues that arise when employing
   FRR for bidirectional co-routed GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

   When bidirectional bypass tunnels are used to locally protect
   bidirectional co-routed GMPLS LSPs, the upstream and downstream PLRs
   may independently assign different bidirectional bypass tunnels in
   the forward and reverse directions.  There is no mechanism in the FRR
   procedures defined in [RFC4090] to coordinate the bidirectional
   bypass tunnel selection between the downstream and upstream PLRs.

   When using FRR procedures with bidirectional co-routed GMPLS LSPs, it
   is possible in some cases for the RSVP signaling refreshes to stop
   reaching some nodes along the primary LSP path after the PLRs finish
   rerouting signaling onto the bypass tunnels.  This may occur when
   using node protection bypass tunnels after a link failure event and
   when RSVP signaling is sent in-fiber and in-band with data.  This is
   caused by the asymmetry of paths that may be taken by the
   bidirectional LSP's signaling in the forward and reverse directions
   after FRR reroute.  In such cases, the RSVP soft-state timeout 
   causes the protected bidirectional LSP to be destroyed, with
   subsequent traffic loss after FRR.

   Protection State Coordination Protocol [RFC6378] is applicable to FRR
   [RFC4090] for local protection of bidirectional co-routed LSPs in
   order to minimize traffic disruptions in both directions.  However,
   this does not address the above mentioned problem of RSVP soft-state
   timeout in control plane.

   This document proposes solutions to the above mentioned problems by
   providing mechanisms in the control plane to complement the FRR
   procedures of [RFC4090] in order to maintain the RSVP soft-state for
   bidirectional co-routed protected GMPLS LSPs and achieve symmetry in
   the paths followed by the traffic and signaling in the forward and
   reverse directions after FRR.  The document further extends RSVP

   signaling so that the bidirectional bypass tunnel selected by the
   upstream PLR matches the one selected by the downstream PLR node for
   a bidirectional co-routed LSP.

   Procedures defined in this document apply to co-routed GMPLS signaled
   PSC bidirectional TE primary and FRR bypass LSPs.  Unless otherwise
   specified in this document, the FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090]
   are not modified by this document.

3.  Fast Reroute For Unidirectional GMPLS LSPs

   The FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] are applicable to
   unidirectional protected LSPs signaled using either RSVP-TE or GMPLS
   procedures and are not modified by the extensions defined in this
   document.  These FRR procedures also apply to bidirectional
   associated GMPLS LSPs where two unidirectional GMPLS LSPs are bound
   together by using association signaling [RFC7551].

4.  Bypass Tunnel Assignment for Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs

   This section describes signaling procedures for bidirectional bypass
   tunnel assignment for GMPLS signaled PSC bidirectional co-routed TE
   LSPs.

4.1.  Bidirectional GMPLS Bypass Tunnel Direction

   This document defines procedures where GMPLS bypass tunnels are
   provisioned in the same direction as the GMPLS primary LSPs.  In
   other words, the GMPLS bypass tunnels originate on the downstream PLR
   and terminate on the downstream MP.  As the originating downstream
   PLR node has the policy information about the locally provisioned
   bypass tunnels, it always initiates the bypass tunnel assignment. 
   The GMPLS bypass tunnels originating from the upstream PLR and
   terminating on the upstream MP are outside the scope of this
   document.

4.2.  Merge Point Labels

   To correctly reroute data traffic over a node protection bypass
   tunnel, the downstream and upstream PLRs have to know, in advance,

   the downstream and upstream MP labels so that data in the forward and
   reverse directions can be redirected through the bypass tunnel after
   FRR respectively.

   [RFC4090] defines procedures for the downstream PLR to obtain the
   protected LSP's downstream MP label from recorded labels in the RRO
   of the RSVP Resv message received at the downstream PLR.

   To obtain the upstream MP label, the procedures specified in
   [RFC4090] are used to record the upstream MP label in the RRO of the
   RSVP Path message.  The upstream PLR obtains the upstream MP label
   from the recorded labels in the RRO of the received RSVP Path
   message.

4.3.  Merge Point Addresses

   To correctly assign a bidirectional bypass tunnel, the downstream and
   upstream PLRs have to know, in advance, the downstream and upstream
   MP addresses.  

   [RFC4561] defines procedures for the downstream PLR to obtain the
   protected LSP's downstream MP address from the recorded node-IDs in
   the RRO of the RSVP Resv message received at the downstream PLR.

   To obtain the upstream MP address, the procedures specified in
   [RFC4561] are used to record upstream MP node-ID in the RRO of the
   RSVP Path message.  The upstream PLR obtains the upstream MP address
   from the recorded node-IDs in the RRO of the received RSVP Path
   message.

4.4.  RRO IPv4/IPv6 Subobject Flags

   RRO IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags are defined in [RFC4090], Section 4.4
   and are equally applicable to the FRR procedure for bidirectional
   GMPLS LSPs.

   The procedures defined in [RFC4090] are used by the downstream PLR to
   signal the IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags upstream in the RRO of the RSVP
   Resv message.  Similarly, these procedures are used by the downstream
   PLR to signal the IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags downstream in the RRO of
   the RSVP Path message.

4.5.  Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Co-ordination

   This document defines signaling procedures and a new
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the RSVP RECORD_ROUTE Object used to
   co-ordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment between the
   downstream and upstream PLRs.

4.5.1.  Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Signaling Procedure

   It is desirable to coordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel
   selected at the downstream and upstream PLRs so that rerouted traffic
   and signaling flow on co-routed paths after FRR.  To achieve this, a
   new RSVP subobject is defined for RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO) that
   identifies a bidirectional bypass tunnel that is assigned at a
   downstream PLR to protect a bidirectional LSP.

   The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject SHOULD be added by each downstream
   PLR in the RSVP Path RECORD_ROUTE message of the GMPLS signaled
   bidirectional primary LSP to record the downstream bidirectional
   bypass tunnel assignment.  This subobject is sent in the RSVP Path
   RECORD_ROUTE message every time the downstream PLR assigns or updates
   the bypass tunnel assignment.  The upstream PLR (downstream MP)
   simply reflects the bypass tunnel assignment in the reverse
   direction.  

   When the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added in the RECORD_ROUTE
   Object:

     o The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject MUST be added prior to the
   Node-ID subobject containing the node's address.

     o The Node-ID subobject MUST also be added.

     o The IPv4 or IPv6 subobject MUST also be added.

     o The Label subobject MUST also be added.

   In the absence of BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject, the upstream PLR
   (downstream MP) SHOULD NOT assign a bypass tunnel in the reverse
   direction.  This allows the downstream PLR to always initiate the
   bypass assignment and upstream PLR (downstream MP) to simply reflect
   the bypass assignment.

   The upstream PLR (downstream MP) that detects a BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobject, selects a reverse bypass tunnel that terminates locally
   with the matching tunnel-ID and has a source address matching the
   node-ID sub-object received in the subobject.  The RRO containing
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject(s) is then simply forwarded downstream in
   the RSVP Path message.

   An upstream PLR (downstream MP) SHOULD examine the entire Path RRO
   and look at all BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobjects in order to assign a
   reverse bypass tunnel.  The choice of a reverse bypass tunnel (if
   multiple bypass tunnels exist) is based on the local policy on the
   downstream MP and is discussed in Section 4.5.2 of this document.

   The bypass assignment co-ordination procedure described in this
   Section can be used for both one-to-one backup described in Section
   3.1 of [RFC4090] and facility backup described in Section 3.2 of
   [RFC4090].

4.5.2.  Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Policy

   In the case of upstream PLR receiving multiple BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobjects from multiple downstream PLRs, the selection of a bypass
   tunnel in the reverse direction can be based on local policy. 
   Examples of such a policy could be to prefer link protection over
   node protection, or to prefer the bypass tunnel to the furthest
   upstream node.  When different policies are used for bypass tunnel
   assignment on the LSP path, it may result in some links in the
   reverse direction not assigned bypass protection during LSP setup as
   shown in examples below.

   As shown in Example 1, node A assigns a node protection bypass tunnel
   in the forward direction but node C does not reflect the node
   protection bypass tunnel in the reverse direction for a protected
   bidirectional GMPLS LSP A-B-C.  Both nodes B and C assign a link
   protection bypass tunnel.  As a result, there is no fast reroute
   protection available in the reverse direction for link A-B for this
   LSP during the LSP setup.  Note that this is corrected by node C
   during the re-coroute procedure after the FRR failure on link A-B as
   specified in Section 6 of this document since GMPLS bypass tunnels
   are bidirectional.

   As shown in Example 2, nodes A and C assign a node protection bypass
   tunnel for a protected bidirectional GMPLS LSP A-B-C.  Node B assigns
   a link protection bypass tunnel but node C does not reflect the
   reverse link protection bypass tunnel.  As a result, there is no fast
   reroute protection available in the reverse direction for link A-B
   for this LSP during the LSP setup.  Note that this is corrected by
   node C during the re-coroute procedure after the FRR failure on link

4.5.3.  BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT Subobject

   The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is used to inform the downstream MP
   of the bypass tunnel being assigned by the PLR.  This can be used to
   coordinate the bypass tunnel assignment for the protected LSP by the
   downstream and upstream PLRs in the forward and reverse directions
   respectively prior or after the failure occurrence.  

   This subobject SHOULD be inserted into the Path RRO by the downstream
   PLR.  It SHOULD NOT be inserted into an RRO by a node which is not a
   downstream PLR.  It MUST NOT be changed by downstream LSRs and MUST
   NOT be added to a Resv RRO.

   The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in RRO has the following format:

          0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


      Type

            Downstream Bypass Assignment.  Value is TBA by IANA.

      Length

            The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
       bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The length is
       always 4 bytes.

      Bypass Tunnel ID

            The bypass tunnel identifier (16 bits).


5.  Link Protection Bypass Tunnels for Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs

   When a bidirectional link protection bypass tunnel is used, after a
   link failure, the downstream PLR reroutes traffic and RSVP messages
   over the bypass tunnel using the procedures defined in [RFC4090]. 
   Upstream PLR reroutes traffic upon detecting the link failure or upon
   receiving RSVP Path message over a bidirectional bypass tunnel. 
   Upstream PLR reroutes RSVP Resv signaling upon receiving RSVP Path
   message over a bidirectional bypass tunnel.  This allows both traffic
   and RSVP signaling to flow on symmetric paths in the forward and
   reverse directions of a bidirectional LSP.

         Figure 1: Flow of RSVP signaling after FRR and link failure

   Consider the Traffic Engineered (TE) network shown in Figure 1. 
   Assume every link in the network is protected with a link protection
   bypass tunnel (e.g. bypass tunnel T3).  For the protected
   bidirectional co-routed LSP whose head-end is on node R1 and tail-end
   is on node R5, each traversed node (a potential PLR) assigns a link
   protection bidirectional co-routed bypass tunnel. 

5.1.  Behavior After Link Failure After FRR

   Consider a link R3-R4 on the protected LSP path fails.  The
   downstream PLR R3 and upstream PLR R4 independently trigger fast
   reroute procedures to redirect traffic onto bypass tunnels T3 in the
   forward and reverse directions.  The downstream PLR R3 also reroutes
   RSVP Path state onto the bypass tunnel T3 using procedures described
   in [RFC4090].  The upstream PLR R4 reroutes RSVP Resv onto the
   reverse bypass tunnel T3 upon receiving RSVP Path message over bypass
   tunnel T3.

5.2.  Revertive Behavior After Link Failure After FRR

   Revertive behavior as defined in [RFC4090], Section 6.5.2, is
   applicable to the link protection of GMPLS bidirectional LSPs.  When
   using the local revertive mode, when downstream MP receives Path
   messages over the restored path, it starts sending Resv over the
   restored path and stops sending Resv over the reverse bypass tunnel. 
   No additional procedure other than that specified in [RFC4090] is
   introduced for revertive behavior by this document.

       Figure 2: Flow of RSVP signaling after FRR and link failure

   Consider the Traffic Engineered (TE) network shown in Figure 2. 
   Assume every link in the network is protected with a node protection
   bypass tunnel.  For the protected bidirectional co-routed LSP whose
   head-end is on node R1 and tail-end is on node R6, each traversed
   node (a potential PLR) assigns a node protection bidirectional co-
   routed bypass tunnel. 

   The proposed solution introduces two phases to invoking FRR
   procedures by the PLR after the link failure.  The first phase
   comprises of FRR procedures to fast reroute data traffic onto bypass
   tunnels in the forward and reverse directions.  The second phase
   re-coroutes the data and signaling in the forward and reverse
   directions after the first phase.

6.1.  Behavior After FRR and Link Failure

   Consider a link R3-R4 on the protected LSP path fails.  The
   downstream PLR R3 and upstream PLR R4 independently trigger fast
   reroute procedures to redirect traffic onto respective bypass tunnels
   T2 and T1 in the forward and reverse directions.  The downstream PLR

Internet-Draft           FRR for TE GMPLS LSPs              June 3, 2016


   R3 also reroutes RSVP Path state onto the bypass tunnel T2 using
   procedures described in [RFC4090].  Note, at this point, node R4
   stops receiving RSVP Path refreshes for the protected bidirectional
   LSP while primary protected traffic continues to flow over bypass
   tunnels.  

6.2.  Behavior After Link Failure To Re-coroute

   The downstream MP R5 that receives rerouted protected LSP RSVP Path
   message through the bypass tunnel, in addition to the regular MP
   processing defined in [RFC4090], gets promoted to a Point of Remote
   Repair (PRR) role and performs the following actions to re-coroute
   signaling and data traffic over the same path in both directions:

      o Finds the bypass tunnel in the reverse direction that terminates
      on the downstream PLR R3.  Note: the downstream PLR R3's address
      can be extracted from the "IPV4 tunnel sender address" in the
      SENDER_TEMPLATE Object of the primary LSP (see [RFC4090], Section
      6.1.1).

      o If reverse bypass tunnel is found and the primary LSP traffic is
      not already rerouted over the found bypass tunnel T2, the PRR R5
      activates FRR reroute procedures to direct traffic over the found
      bypass tunnel T2 in the reverse direction.  In addition, the PRR
      R5 also reroutes RSVP Resv over the bypass tunnel T2 in the
      reverse direction.

      o If reverse bypass tunnel is not found, the PRR R5 immediately
      tears down the primary LSP.


                                                <- RESV
            [R1]---[R2]----[R3]--X--[R4]----[R5]---[R6]
              PATH ->        \              /
                              +<<-------->>+
                             Bypass Tunnel T2
                            traffic + signaling

                  Protected LSP:  {R1-R2-R3-R4-R5-R6}
                  R3's Bypass T2: {R3-R5}

        Figure 3: Flow of RSVP signaling after FRR and re-corouted


   Figure 3 describes the path taken by the traffic and signaling after
   completing re-coroute of data and signaling in the forward and
   reverse paths described earlier.  Node R4 will stop receiving the
   Path and Resv messages and it will timeout the RSVP soft-state,

Internet-Draft           FRR for TE GMPLS LSPs              June 3, 2016


   however, this will not cause the LSP to be torn down.  RSVP signaling
   at node R2 is not affected by the FRR and re-corouting.

   If the link failure is unidirectional in the direction of R4 to R3,
   node R3 will stop receiving the RSVP Resv messages from node R4 and
   this will cause RSVP soft-state to timeout on node R3.  However,
   unidirectional link failure in the opposite direction will not result
   in RSVP soft-state timeout as node R5 will trigger the re-coroute
   procedure after receiving RSVP Path message over the bypass tunnel
   from node R3.

   If downstream MP R5 receives multiple RSVP Path messages through
   multiple bypass tunnels (e.g. as a result of multiple failures), the
   PRR SHOULD identify a bypass tunnel that terminates on the farthest
   downstream PLR along the protected LSP path (closest to the primary
   bidirectional LSP head-end) and activate the reroute procedures
   mentioned above.

   The downstream MP MAY optionally support re-corouting in data plane
   as follows.  If the downstream MP is pre-configured with
   bidirectional bypass tunnel, as soon as the MP node receives the
   primary LSP packets on this bypass tunnel, it MAY switch the upstream
   traffic on to this bypass tunnel.  In order to identify the primary
   LSP packets through this bypass tunnel, Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP)
   of the bypass tunnel MUST be disabled.  The signaling procedure
   described above in this Section will still apply, and MP checks
   whether the primary LSP traffic and signaling is already rerouted
   over the found bypass tunnel, if not, perform the above signaling
   procedure.

6.3.  Revertive Behavior After Link Failure

   Revertive behavior as defined in [RFC4090], Section 6.5.2, is
   applicable to node protection of GMPLS bidirectional LSPs.  When
   using the local revertive mode, when downstream MP (R4) (before
   re-corouting) and PRR (R5) (after re-corouting) receive Path messages
   over the restored path, they start sending Resv over the restored
   path and stop sending Resv over the reverse bypass tunnel.  No
   additional procedure other than that specified in [RFC4090] is
   introduced for revertive behavior by this document.  

7.  Compatibility

   New RSVP subobject BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT is defined for RECORD_ROUTE
   Object in this document.  Per [RFC2205], nodes not supporting this
   subobject will ignore the subobject but forward it without
   modification.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a new BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject for the
   RECORD_ROUTE Object that is carried in an RSVP signaling message. 
   Thus in the event of the interception of a signaling message, more
   information about LSP's fast reroute protection can be deduced than
   was previously the case.  This is judged to be a very minor security
   risk as this information is already available by other means.

   Otherwise, this document introduces no additional security
   considerations.  For general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS related
   security issues, see the MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA manages the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters>.  IANA is requested
   to assign a value for the new BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the
   "Class Type 21 ROUTE_RECORD - Type 1 Route Record" registry. 

   This document introduces a new subobject for RECORD_ROUTE Object:

   +--------+-------------------+---------+---------+---------------+
   | Value  | Description       | Carried | Carried | Reference     |
   |        |                   | in Path | in Resv |               |
   +--------+-------------------+---------+---------+---------------+
   | TBA By | BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT | Yes     | No      | This document |
   | IANA   | subobject         |         |         |               |
