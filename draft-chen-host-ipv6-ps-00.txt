Abstract

   When operators start to customize user terminals, host-based IPv6
   translation will be feasible.  Host-based translation should overcome
   single-point failure problems and support various connections between
   two IP families networks simultaneously.  In addition, legacy IPv4
   applications should not be modified.  This document will discuss
   host-based translation applicable scenarios and corresponding issues.

1.  Introduction

   Current network is mostly depending on IPv4.  And, several
   sophisticated technologies have been proposed to prolong the IPv4
   lifetime, such as NAPT, A+P[A+P] .  Although these solutions could
   alleviate IPv4 depletion pressure in a short term, the transition
   from IPv4 to IPv6 is still a steady trend of network development.

   Technical solutions of IPv6 transition could be divided into three
   categories, namely dual-stack, tunneling and translation technology.

   Dual-stack hosts can communicate with both the IPv4 and IPv6 hosts,
   but it can not help to resolve the IPv4 address exhaustion problems.
   The tunneling technology can connect IPv4 networks across IPv6-only
   networks and IPv6 networks across IPv4-only networks, thus one IP
   family communication is transparent with another IP family.

   The translation technology can help the communications between two
   address families.  With regard to whether deploy translator on hosts
   or networks, the majority solutions would like to choose the latter
   since modifications on a numerous hosts were treated as not easy
   works.  However, host-based translation schemes would progress more
   easily in recent time, since more and more operators start to
   customize hosts for their subscribers.

   In this document, host-based translation scenarios and underlying
   problems have been described.


2.   Host-based translation scenarios and problems

2.1.   Host-based translation scenarios

   Figure 1 shows host-based translation scenarios.  Translator modules
   have been deployed on H1 and H3 located in IPv6 only network.  And,
   both conventional IPv4 applications and IPv6 applications have been
   installed.  H2 is legacy IPv4 host located in IPv4 site.

   With regard to this scenario, H1 and H3 might maintain following
   service connections simultaneously.

   o  case 1: H1 and H4 initiate a service call with H2 using a IPv4
      application

   o  case 2: H1 initiates a service all with the IPv6 application of H3
      using a IPv4 application

   o  case 3: H3 initiates a service call with H2 using a IPv6
      application

   o  case 4: H1 initiates a service call with the IPv4 application of
      H3 using a IPv4 application

2.2.  Problems

   From individual case point-of-view, dual-stack-lite[DS-Lite] can
   support case 1, and BIA [RFC3338] or BIS [RFC2767] can support the
   case 2, and NAT64[NAT64] can support case 3.  There are no solutions
   to perform case 4.

   According to the analysis, According to the analysis, existing
   solution can!_t satisfy the demands of maintaining above all
   potential communications in the 4/6 host at one time.  Furthermore,
   following problems should be considered.

   o  It is hard to modify numerous conventional IPv4 applications, when
      the hosts only have an IPv6 connection

   o  The hosts located in IPv6 site usually do not initiate query to
      DNS4 server, where IPv4 peer record is stored

   o  The hosts usually do not identify peer application type, thus
      translation handling can not be performed correctly
