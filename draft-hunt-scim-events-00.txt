1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification profiles Security Event Tokens (SET) [RFC8417] to
   define Security Events and mechanisms for delivery with SCIM Protocol
   [RFC7644] systems that can be used for asynchronous transaction
   confirmations, replication, cross-domain provisioning co-ordination,
   and security signals.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.3.  Definitions

   This specification uses definitions from the following
   specifications:

   *  Security Event Tokens [RFC8417], and

   *  System for Cross-Domain Identity Management Protocol [RFC7644].

   Additionally, the following terms are defined:

   Attributes and Claims
      The JWT specification [RFC7519] upon which SET is based uses the
      term "claims" to refer to attributes in a JSON token.  SCIM in
      contrast uses the term "attributes" to refer to JSON attributes.
      For the purposes of this draft, the terms "attributes" and
      "claims" are equivalent.

   CP
      Abbreviation for "Co-ordinated Provisioning" as defined in
      Section 2.2.

Internet-Draft           draft-hunt-scim-events            February 2022


   DBR
      Abbreviation for "Domain Based Replication" as defined in
      Section 2.1.

   Event Feed
      This describes the notion that a feed MAY be individualized per
      client.  A service provider MAY offer to allow Event Receiver's to
      "subscribe" to specific event types or events about specific
      resources.  If no option is offered, it is assumed the client will
      receive all events about all resources.

   Event Receiver
      A system that receives events for the purpose of subsequent action
      (e.g. such as replication), co-ordination of workflow, or
      signalling.

   Event Publisher
      A system that issues SETs based on a change that has occurred at a
      SCIM Service Provider.  For example, events MAY originate from a
      SCIM Create, Modify, or Delete per [RFC7644] request.  A SCIM
      Service Provider MAY be an Event Publisher or an independent
      service that aggregates events into Event Receiver feeds.

   Message Bus
      Any communications protocol or system that enables a message (e.g.
      a SET) to be sent to one or more receivers at the same time.
      Typically participants connect to a "bus" rather than in point-to-
      point transfer such as SET HTTP Push [RFC8935].  The "bus" takes
      care of fault-tolerance, routing, and delivery to recipients.

   RS
      Abbreviation for "Risk Signals" as defined in Section 2.3.

   SCIM Service Provider
      An HTTP server that implements SCIM Protocol [RFC7644] and SCIM
      Schema [RFC7643].

   SET
      Abbreviation for "Security Event Token" as defined in [RFC8417]

2.  Processing Modes for Events

   This specification defines 4 processing modes for SCIM Security
   Events that have different objectives, data requirements, and
   considerations for using Security Event Tokens.

2.1.  Domain Based Replication

   The objective of DBR is to synchronize resource changes between SCIM
   replicas in a common administrative domain.  In this mode,
   information about changes for resources are shared between replicas
   for immediate processing.  The intention is that every replica node
   contains the same information content in a timely fashion.

                Figure 1: Domain Based Replication Sequence

   In this mode, replication is a server-to-server process and it is
   assumed that access rights between servers is identical.  Access to
   these messages MUST be limited to communication between replicating
   nodes with appropriate authorization.  From a Privacy Perspective, it
   is assumed that all replicas of the server are in the same
   administrative domain and that the sharing of information is
   primarily for performance and availability reasons and the sharing
   information between replicas does not by itself enable access to new
   parties (e.g. where a user may not have consented).

2.2.  Co-ordinated Provisioning

   In "Co-ordinated Provisioning" (CP), SCIM resource change events are
   shared between domains with the restriction that the actual attribute
   value data is omitted.  In any Event Publisher and Receiver
   relationship, the set of SCIM resources that are co-ordinated is
   managed within the context of a "Feed" and MAY be a subset of the
   total set of resources on either side.  To support this, "feed"



Hunt                     Expires 17 August 2022                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           draft-hunt-scim-events            February 2022


   events are defined that indicate the addition and removal of SCIM
   resources from a feed.  For example, when a user consents to the
   sharing of information between domains, events about the User MAY be
   added to the feed between the Event Publisher and Receiver.

                Figure 2: Co-Ordinated Provisioning Sequence

   In CP mode, the receiver of an event must call back to the
   originating SCIM Service Provider (e.g. using a SCIM GET request) to
   reconcile the newly changed resource in order to obtain the changes.

   Co-ordinated provisioning has the following benefits:

   *  Differences in schema (e.g. attributes) between domains.  For
      example, a receiving domain may only be interested or only be
      allowed access to a few attributes (e.g. role based access data)
      to enable access to an application.

   *  Different Event Receivers MAY have differing needs access to
      information and thus be assigned varying access rights.  Minimal
      information events combined with call-backs for data allows data
      filtering to be applied.

   *  Receivers can take independent action.  For example deciding which
      attributes or resource lifecycle changes to accept.  For example,
      in the case of a conflict, a receiver can prioritize one domain
      source over another.

   *  A receiver MAY throttle or buffer changes rather than act
      immediately on a notification.  For example, for a frequently
      changing resource, the receiver MAY choose to make scheduled SCIM
      GET for resources that have been marked "dirty" by events received
      in the last scheduled cycle.

   A disadvantage of the CP approach is that it may be considered costly
   in the sense that each event received might trigger a call back to
   the event issuer.  This cost should be weighed against the cost
   producing filtered information in each event for each receiver.
   Further a receiver is not required to make a call-back on every
   provisioning event.

   It is assumed that an underlying relationship between domains exists
   that permits the exchange of personal information and credentials.
   For example the decision to perform SCIM provisioning operations at
   the SCIM Service Provider issuing change events, was previously
   authorized and appropriate confidentiality and privacy agreements
   have been met in cross-domain scenarios.  Examples of this might be
   services for hire by an employer or a specific consent from an end-
   user as part of a online authorization where individual consent was
   obtained.

2.3.  Risk Signals

   The sharing of risk signals (RS) is intended for the purpose of co-
   ordinating change events between a SCIM Service Provider and another
   related security service.  For example, when a password or other
   authentication factor has changed, a receiving security system can
   choose to terminate current User sessions to force a re-
   authentication against the modified User resource.

Internet-Draft           draft-hunt-scim-events            February 2022


   These signals MAY also include those described in the OpenID Shared
   Signals Working Group Specifications [SSWG].

   These events are intended for receivers where there is a prior
   relationship on behalf of the users described in the SCIM Service
   Provider.  The intent of sharing information about security events is
   for the purpose of securing a user account and ensuring privacy.

2.4.  Async Requests

   A SCIM provisioning client MAY wish to request "asynchronous"
   processing using the "Prefer Header for HTTP", Section 4.1 [RFC7240].
   In this mode, a normal SCIM protocol POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE
   request is made, and the HTTP Header Prefer is included with the
   value respond-async.  When a SCIM Client signals respond-async, the
   SCIM server response changes to HTTP Status 202 Accepted as defined
   in [RFC7231].  The Location header returned is the final resource
   location and no payload is present.  Following acceptance of an
   asynchronous request, a notification of completion can be issued
   using the Async Event Notification per Section 3.5.1.  The location
   returned SHALL correspond to the sub claim in the future Async Event
   SET message.

3.  SCIM Events

   A SCIM event is a message, in the form of a Security Event Token
   [RFC8417], that conveys information about changes that have occurred
   at a SCIM Service Provider that may be of interest to a receiving
   system.  Examples of events include:

   *  Resource lifecycle events including creation, activation,
      deactivation, and removal of a resource.

   *  Risk signal events (e.g. password reset, authentication factor
      change) which may be used by a receiver to take a security
      response such as resetting or revoking current user sessions and
      tokens.

   *  A Password update event is used to securely distribute a hashed
      value in an administrative domain.

   *  A Async Event is used to acknowledge completion status of an
      Asynchronous SCIM Request.

3.1.  Common Event Attributes

   The following attributes are available for all events defined.  The
   values are contained within the event payload per Section 2
   [RFC8417].

   id
      A SCIM id attribute identifying the SCIM Service Provider's
      resource that was modified.  This value is required.

   externalId
      If known, the externalId value of the SCIM Resource that MAY be
      used by a receiver to identify the corresponding resource in the
      Event Receiver's domain.

   txn
      For the purposes of SCIM, this SET claim should be used to
      identify unique transactions originating at a SCIM Service
      Provider.  The purpose is to detect duplicate transactions that
      may have been received.  If not provided, the SET jti claim MAY be
      used.  The difference is that txn identifies uniqueness within a
      SCIM Service Provider whereas JTI only identifies a unique JWT
      token.

   data
      Defined in SCIM Bulk Operations, Section 3.7 [RFC7644], contains
      the information necessary to propagate the transaction to the

      receiving node.  For example, after processing a SCIM Create
      operation, the data contained includes the final representation of
      the created entity by the SCIM Service Provider including the
      assigned id value.

   attributes
      An array of attributes that were added, revised, or removed.  For
      example:
      "attributes": ["username","emails"]

   Depending on the Processing Mode or Event definition, usually only
   one of data or attributes is provided.

   The sub claim SHALL hold the SCIM Service Provider's Resource URI
   value of the affected object.  Note: that the SCIM Bulk path
   attribute is SHALL NOT be used as this duplicates the sub claim.

   This specifications defines a new schema URI prefix
   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM which is used as the prefix for the
   following defined SCIM Events.

3.2.  SCIM Feed Events

   This section defines events related to notices about which resources
   are being added or removed from an event feed.  These events are used
   in Co-operative Provisioning scenarios where only a sub-set of
   entities are shared across an Event Feed.  The URI prefix for these
   events is: urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:feed

3.2.1.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:feed:add

   The specified resource was added to the Event Feed.  A feed:add does
   not indicate a resource is new or has been recently created.  For
   example, an existing user has had a new role (e.g.  CRM_User) added
   to their profile which has caused their resource to join a feed.

   SCIM Service Provider.  These events are used in both Domain Based
   Replication (DBR) and Co-operative Provisioning (CP) mode.  The URI
   prefix for these events is: urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:prov

3.3.1.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:prov:create

   Indicates a new SCIM resource has been created by the SCIM Service
   Provider and has been added to the Event Feed.  Note that when a
   create event is sent, a corresponding
   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:feed:add event SHOULD NOT be issued in the
   same feed.  In DBR mode mode, all claims of the new resource are
   included.  In CP mode, the attributes returned discloses what
   attributes were created at the publisher.  In DBR mode, the set of
   values reflecting the final state of the resource at the service
   provider are provided using the "data" attribute.  Note that because
   this is a replication request, the id attribute that was assigned by
   the SCIM Service Provider is shared so that all replicas in the
   domain use the same resource identifier.

   The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been deactivated and
   disabled.  The exact meaning must be agreed to by the Event Publisher
   and its corresponding Event Receiver.  Typically this means the sub
   may no longer have an active security session.  As with the activate
   event, this event has minimal disclosure requirements.

3.4.  SCIM Signals Events

   This section defines security signal events that have occured within
   a SCIM Service Provider.The URI prefix for these events is:
   urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:signal

3.4.1.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:sig:authMethod

   A new authentication method has been added to the User profile.  As
   attackers often use new authentication methods to lock-out Users from
   their account, this signal can be used by the receiver that the
   chance of account them may be temporarily elevated.  The receiver MAY
   also wish to take action such as resetting current authorizations or
   sessions.

4.  Event Delivery

   As Security Event Tokens are based on JWT tokens, it is possible to
   exchange events by a number of transfer mechanisms such as: XMPP
   [RFC6120], HTTP [RFC7540], and Message Buses (e.g.  [RFC3259], Apache
   Kafka [Kafka]).  This draft discusses 2 general delivery methods:
   Message Bus and Point-to-Point.

4.1.  Security Event Token Signing and Encryption

   This specification uses Security Event Tokens as the message format
   for SCIM Events.  As SETs are based on JWT tokens [RFC7519], they can
   be transmitted unsecurity, signed, or encrypted.  For more
   information see the JWT Cookbook specification [RFC7520] for
   examples.  The decision on whether to use JWS and JWE depends on
   operational considerations.  For each SCIM Feed relationship, it is
   up to deployers to decide on signing, encryption and algorithm
   requirements.  Deployers SHOULD be aware that too much emphasis on
   turning on every possible encryption feature may cause operational
   performance to suffer.  Deployers MUST weigh the security trade-offs

   of up-to-date SCIM services, vs. the potential information loss of an
   event.

   Unsecured
      Per Section 6 [RFC7519], tokens MAY be generated with
      {"alg":"none"}.  This mode speeds up processing and is best used
      in DBR scenarios.  Unencrypted tokens MUST be transferred over
      authenticated TLS layer encryption and SHOULD only be used in a
      restricted network environment.

   Signed
      JWS ([RFC7515]) signed SETs are useful when it is important to be
      able to verify the issuer of a SET as valid.  In addition, some
      systems MAY wish to validate the authenticity of the event in a
      review process which may occur at a later date.  While the content
      can be validated as originating from the correct issuer and is
      unmodified, the message contents remain unsecure.  Signed SETs
      MUST be transferred over encrypted transport.

   Encrypted
      JWE ([RFC7516]) are encrypted SETs and are useful when the
      transport mechanism is not fully securable (e.g. messages carried
      by a third party).  The use of JWEs ensures only the designated
      receiver can read the event and provides mutual authentication
      within the SET mesage itself.

4.2.  Point-to-Point Delivery Over HTTP

   Security Event Tokens MAY be delivered using push-based HTTP delivery
   [RFC8935], or pull-based HTTP Polling [RFC8936].  Both of these
   protocols define a method of transfer and acknowledgement to prevent
   loss-of-information and to provide re-transmission and recover.  The
   method of transfer is best decided by considering the following
   advantages and disadvantages in a production scenario:

   Push-based delivery has the following advantages:

   *  Message transfer is instant (when compared to using a common Event
      Publisher acting as a relay), and in high event frequency
      scenarios, HTTP connections can be kept open.

   *  Scales well when an SCIM Event Publisher has thousands of event
      receivers and TCP resources may be limited.

   *  Does not require events to be routed to a single publisher node.
      SCIM Events may be issued by SCIM Service Provider nodes where the
      transaction occurred.

Internet-Draft           draft-hunt-scim-events            February 2022


   *  SCIM Events only need to be retained until they have been
      delivered to designated receivers.

   Push-delivery has the following disadvantages:

   *  A SCIM Event Publisher system needs authorization credentials
      enabling it to access the HTTP SCIM Event delivery endpoint.

   *  When synchronizing business data that is behind protected
      firewalls, a virtual network or other firewall policy may be
      required to allow external network based SCIM providers to deliver
      SCIM Events to internally hosted systems.

   Delivery by HTTP Polling has the following advantages:

   *  It is possible for a SCIM Event Receiver to use the same SCIM
      credentials it uses when access the normal SCIM Service Provider
      service defined by [RFC7644].

   *  Systems behind protected network boundaries can reach externally
      hosted systems without requiring special firewall or network
      configuration.

   *  Instantaneous transfer can be used using HTTP Long-polling as
      described Section 2.1 of [RFC8936].

   Polling-based delivery has the following disadvantages:

   *  Long-polling requires the use of persistent connections for which
      TCP resources may be limited.  HTTP Long-polling is best used in
      scenarios when there are relatively few Event Receivers.

   *  The SCIM Event Publisher MUST retain events for the Event Receiver
      until delivered.

4.3.  Using Message Bus Delivery

   Security Event Tokens MAY be delivered using a message bus.  While
   this draft will not talk about any particular message bus, it will
   discuss the pros and cons for message buses in general and any
   anticipated issues and requirements.

   Message buses have the following advantages:

   *  Connection management and credentials may be greatly simplified as
      participants only need to authenticate to the "bus" to issue and
      receive events.




Hunt                     Expires 17 August 2022                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft           draft-hunt-scim-events            February 2022


   *  Message buses can have "broadcast" features that are able to
      deliver the same event to many recipients such as in a global
      deployment of replicated SCIM servers.  Issuers save resources by
      only having to publish once to a bus rather than to each receiver
      directly.

   *  Depending on the implementation, a Message Bus can be used as a
      buffer and in some cases for data recovery.  For example, some
      buses may have infinite retention of events.

   *  Message-buses can support bi-directional and other more complex
      flow relationships (e.g. sharding).

   Message buses may have following disadvantages:

   *  A message bus may have some delivery delays (seconds to minutes)
      when compared to point-to-point systems.

   *  Message buses may require significant infrastructure commitments
      in order to meet delivery reliability.  However it may also be
      true that a point-to-point system may also impose significant
      resource requirements requiring a SCIM service provider to assume
      the same work.

   *  Multi-issuer scenarios may require more conflict resolution
      processing.  E.g. such as prioritizing specific nodes as "masters"
      for specific SCIM attributes.

5.  Event Handling

5.1.  Conflict Resolution

   In scenarios where there may be multiple issuers of SCIM Events, it
   becomes possible that conflicts can arise when the same version of a
   resource is modified by multiple parties.

   Editors note: TO BE COMPLETED

5.2.  Optimizing Events

   In cases where resources change frequently, SCIM Service Providers
   MAY choose to release events on an interval basis in order to reduce
   traffic.  For example, a large Group with millions of members may
   have hundreds of changes per minute.  For optimization, a SCIM
   Service Provider MAY choose to issue a cumulative event once per
   minute instead of for each change event.
