1. Introduction

   This document assumes the reader is familiar with Mobile IPv6 defined
   in [1], with the concept of Mobile Router (MR) and with the Nemo
   terminology defined in [2].

   From the discussions on the mailing list, it appears that the common
   current understanding of the problem space of Route Optimization
   (RO), in the Nemo context, is still limited.

   This draft attempts to clarify the state of the discussion and
   propose a taxonomy of the various aspects of the problem.  We will
   look at different possible types of route optimizations related to
   mobile network.

   Firstly, the Mobile Router can initiate route optimization with
   corresponding nodes (CN) on behalf of the mobile network nodes (MNN).

   Secondly, we consider the feasibility of having a visiting mobile
   node (VMN) performing MIPv6 RO over the NEMO base protocol.

   Thirdly, we explore the prospect of performing RO over the routing
   infrastructure. This involves optimizing the route between two
   routers situated near to each end point.

   Lastly, route optimizations involving nested mobile networks are
   explored. This involves minimizing the number of tunnels required
   when there is multiple levels of nesting.


2. MR-to-CN

   This section covers the case where the Route Optimization is
   performed between the MR and the correspondent nodes which mobile
   network nodes (MNNs) are communicating with.  This scenario is useful
   when a lot of MNNs in a mobile network is communicating with a few
   corresponding nodes.  In such cases the MR only needs to send one
   binding update (BU) to optimized the route between CN and a few MNNs.

   A major issue with this form of optimization is that the end-to-end
   principle of the MIPv6 Reverse Routability (RR) test is broken.  The
   RR test is meant to ensure the care-of address (CoA) and the home
   address (HoA) are collocated. With a mobile network, when the MR
   performs RO on behalf of the MNNs, the CoA in BU will be the MR's
   CoA.  Thus, a MNN is reachable via the CoA, but not at the CoA.

   Some tricks may be performed on the fly by the MRs but it seems that
   a clean MR-to-CN optimization for Nemo will impact the CN function.

Internet-Draft                RO-Taxonomy                  February 2004


   Once we modify the CN behavior, we need to introduce a negotiation
   from the start of the RR test to determine the protocol. In
   particular, the Mobile Node and the CN must decide whether checking
   the collocation is possible, and if not, whether a CN is willing to
   accept the risk. If not, the optimization may be limited to
   triangular routing MR->CN->HA->MR.

   This is a major evolution from [1], since MIPv6 has no such
   negotiation capability at this time.


3. MIPv6 Route Optimization over NEMO

   MIPv6 mobile nodes can move everywhere.  If the user brings mobile
   nodes (e.g. MIP VoIP terminal) into the vehicle that supports NEMO
   function, packets destined to the mobile node will have to be routed
   not only to its home agent but also the home agent of the mobile
   router. This pattern resembles Nested NEMO case which is described in
   later section.  This solution is needed to use both MIPv6 and NEMO
   technologies efficiently.

   When a Mobile Node visits a Mobile Network, the best Route
   Optimization is obtained if the path in the Infrastructure is the
   same as if the Mobile Network was attached at the attachment point of
   the Mobile Router (i.e., there is not additional Tunneling that is
   linked to NEMO).

   A possible approach to this is to extend the solution for nested
   mobile network optimization to include VMN as well.  In this case,
   the VMN is treated as though it is an MR.  This type of solution will
   most likely require some extensions for a MIPv6 VMN and CN.


4. Optimization within the infrastructure

   This section elaborates on cases where the Route Optimization is
   performed within the Routing Infrastructure. This model is useful
   when an ISP wants to control the route optimization procedures and
   does not desire to add any functions to the CN or the MR in order to
   achieve route optimizations between CN and LFN.

   In this model, both the LFN behind the MR and the Correspondent can
   be MIP agnostic. The drawback is the introduction of Mobile Routes in
   specific Routers, causing additional signaling and load to the
   Routing Fabric.

   The general idea is that there is a correspondent-side router (C-side
   Router) in the infrastructure that is located "closer" to the CN than

   the HA of the MR. This C-side Router can terminate MIP on behalf of
   the CN.

                       Optimization in the Infrastructure

    This optimization is only valid when the path via the C-side Router
   is shorter than the path via the Home Agent.

   The Optimization can take place independently for the 2 directions of
   the traffic:

   Egress

      The MR locates the C-side Router, establishes a tunnel with that
      Router and sets a route to the Correspondent Node via the C-side
      Router over the Tunnel. After this, traffic to the Correspondent
      Node does not flow through the Home Agent anymore.

   Ingress

      The C-side Router is on the way of the traffic from the
      Correspondent Node to the Home Agent.  Also, it is aware of the MR
      and the mobile network behind the MR and establishes the
      appropriate tunnel and route. After this, it is able to reroute
      traffic to the mobile network over the tunnel to the MR.


4.1 Route Optimization within a ISP network

   This form of Route Optimization provides local savings for an ISP.
   This idea was described in Ohnishi's Mobile Border Gateway draft. The
   goal is to locate the closest (BGP) gateway for a Correspondent that
   is located outside of the domain, and tunnel between the MR and that
   gateway as opposed to the Home Agent for that specific Correspondent.

4.2 Correspondent Router

   A globally better optimization is obtained if the tunnel from the MR
   is terminated closer to the destination on the Correspondent side.
   This is the role of a Correspondent Router (CR).

       +-------------------+    ===========Mobile Network========

                       Correspondent Router

   The MR locates the CR for a given Correspondent and establishes a
   Tunnel to the CR for that destination and its prefix(es). Then, the
   CR establishes the Tunnel back to the MR and the Mobile Routes to the
   MR's Mobile Networks via that Tunnel.

   A key point is that the CR must be on the interception path of the
   traffic from the Correspondent to the Mobile Networks in order to
   reroute the traffic over the appropriate Tunnel. This can be achieved
   in several fashions:

   Redistribution

      There's a limited Number of CRs that cover an Autonomous System.
      They redistribute the Mobile Routes on the fly, or within rate and
      amount limits. Garbage Collection is done at appropriate time to
      limit the perturbation on the Routing.

   Default Router

      The CR is a Default Router for the Correspondent, or for the whole
      AS of the Correspondent (it's a border gateway). In this case,
      redistribution is not needed.

Internet-Draft                RO-Taxonomy                  February 2004


   Core Routers

      The Core Routers for the network of the Correspondent are all CRs.
      If the path from the correspondent to the Home Agent does not pass
      via a CR, then it's not worth optimizing. If it is, then the CRs
      are on the way. Again, redistribution is not needed.


4.3 Distributed Anchor Routers

   Taking the idea of a correspondent router a step further, it is
   possible to have a distributed set of anchor routers across the
   Internet.  Outgoing packets sent from a mobile network will be
   tunneled to one of the nearest anchor router (instead of to the home
   agent of the mobile router).  This M-Side (Mobile Network Side)
   anchor router will decapsulate the packet, inspect the destination,
   and tunnel the packet to another anchor router situated near the CN
   (C-Side Anchor Router).  From there, the packet will be decapsulated
   and forwarded to the CN.

         o                                    # n #

                           ====Mobile Network=======

                       Optimization in the Infrastructure

   The C-Side Anchor Router will be subjected to the same condition as
   listed in the previous sub-section if packets sent from the CN to the
   mobile network are to be route-optimized too.  Otherwise, the
   solution will only partially optimize routing to a triangular routing
   (i.e. packet sent by CN will still go through the home agent of the
   mobile network).

   The anchor router share many similarities with the concept of
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) proposed in Hierarchical MIPv6 (HMIPv6)
   [9]. In fact, it can be combined with HMIPv6 whereby each M-Side
   anchor router is also an MAP, and the MR obtains a regional
   care-of-address from the MAP.

5. Nested Mobile Network

5.1 Nested Tunnels Optimization

   This section covers the case where one mobile network is within
   another mobile network. For example, a user brings a Personal Area
   Network (PAN) consisting of some IP devices to a train which is also
   using NEMO technology.  In another example, a car which conatins a
   mobile network moves into the ferry which has another mobile network.
   This configuration of mobile networks within another mobile network
   is called nested Mobile Networks.

   Let us illustrate the problem by an example. In this example, the
   nested Mobile Network has a tree topology. In the tree each node is a
   basic Mobile Network, represented by its MR.

                       An example nested Mobile Network


   This example focuses on a Local Fixed Node (LFN) at depth 3 (in Net3)
   inside the tree, represented by its mobile router MR3. The path to
   the Top Level Mobile Router (TLMR) MR1 and then the Internet is:

                           MR3 -> MR2 -> MR1 -> Internet

   Consider the case where a LFN belonging to Net3 sends a packet to a
   Correspondent Node (CN) in the Internet, and the CN replies back.

   With no Nested Tunnels Optimization, we would have three
   bi-directional nested tunnels, as described in [3] and illustrated in
   the following drawings:


                                 -----------.
                       --------/          /-----------.
              -------/        |          |           /-----------
    CN ------( -  - | -  -  - |  -  -  - | -  -  -  |  -  -  -  (-------- LFN
       MR3_HA -------\        |          |           \----------- MR3
                MR2_HA --------\          \----------- MR2
                          MR1_HA ----------- MR1


                       No Nested Tunnels Optimization



   Such a solution introduces the following problems:

   "Pinball" routing

      Both inbound and outbound packets will flow via the HAs of all the
      MRs on their path within the NEMO, with increased latency, less
      resilience and more bandwidth usage.  To illustrate this effect,
      the figure below shows the route taken by a packet sent from LFN

      An extra IPv6 header is added per level of nesting to all the

      its HA), are different hop to hop.

   On the other hand, with a Nested Tunnel Optimization, we would have
   at most one bi-directional tunnel outside the Mobile Network, that
   may depend on the traffic flow:


                                                      __- --_
            Tunnel---------------------------- MR1 ( Mobile  ) MR3
    CN ----------(  -  -  -  -   -  -  -  -  -  - ( -  -  -  - )--------- LFN
          Endpoint---------------------------- MR1 ( Network ) MR3
                                                     --___---

                       Nested Tunnels Optimization

    The end-point of such a Tunnel on the Mobile side may either be MR1
   or MR3, depending on the solution. In the case of a Mobile Node
   visiting Net3, that Mobile Node may also be the end-point.

   The potential approaches for avoiding the nesting of tunnels include:

   Mobile Aggregation

      This model applies to a category of problems were the Mobile
      Networks share a same administration and consistently move
      together (e.g. a fleet at sea). In this model, there is a cascade
      of Home Agents.

      The main Home Agent is fixed in the infrastructure, and advertises
      an aggregated view of all the Mobile Networks. This aggregation is
      actually divided over a number of Mobile Routers, the TLMRs. The
      TLMRs subdivide some of their address space to the other Mobile
      Routers forming their fleet, for which they are Home Agent.

      As Home Agents, the TLMRs terminate MIP Tunnels from the inside of
      the Mobile Network. As Mobile Router, they also terminate their
      home Tunnels. As routers, they forward packets between the 2
      tunnels.

   Surrogate

      The TLMR acts as a proxy in the MIP registration, in a fashion of
      MIPv4 Foreign Agent or HMIP MAP (see [9]). For instance, the TLMR
      maintains a Tunnel to each MR, a Tunnel to the HA of each MR, and
      switches packets between the two.

   Internal Routing and gateway

      This item can be approached from a MANET standpoint. This was
      already done for DSR (see [10]) and AODV (see [11] and [8]) From a
      Nemo standpoint, a full MANET is not necessary since the goal is
      to find a way to the infrastructure, as opposed to any-to-any
      connectivity.

   RRH

      The Reverse Routing Header (RRH) approach avoids the multiple
      encapsulation of the traffic but maintains the home tunnel of the
      first MR on the egress path. It is described in details in [5].
      The first MR on the way out (egress direction) encapsulates the
      packet over its reverse tunnel, using a form of Record Route
      header, the RRH.

      The next MRs simply swap their CoA and the source of the packet,
      saving the original source in the RRH. The HA transforms the RRH
      in a Routing Header to perform a Source Routing across the nested
      Mobile Network, along the ingress path to the target MR.

   Access Router Option

      The Access Router Option (ARO) approach [6] is somewhat similar to
      the RRH in that only the home tunnel of the first MR in the egress
      path is maintained.  This is done by having MR to send an ARO in
      Binding Update to inform its HA the address of its access router.
      Using this information, HA can build a Routing Header to
      source-route a packet to the target MR within in a nested mobile
      network.  Details can be found in [6].

   Prefix delegation approach

      The prefix delegation approach [7] is somewhat to HMIPv6 what Nemo
      is to MIPv6. The Access Router of the nested structure is both a
      Nemo Home Agent and a DHCP-PD server, for an aggregation that it
      owns and advertises to the Infrastructure. When visiting the
      nested structure, each MR is delegated a mobile network prefix
      from the AR using DHCP-Prefix Delegation. The MR registers this
      delegated MNP to the AR that is acting as a Nemo Home Agent. The
      MR also autoconfigures an address from the delegated MNP and uses
      it as a CareOf to register its own MNPs to its own Home Agent
      using Nemo basic support. It is possible for a MR to protect its
      own MNPs while advertising in the clear the local MNP for other
      MRs to roam in. This allows a strict privacy of visited and
      visitors, and enables some specific policies in each Mobile
      Router. Details can be found in  [7].

5.2 Route Optimization inside the Nested Mobile Network

   Although optimization  within a mobile network is not within the
   charter of the NEMO working group, it might be insightful to discuss
   such optimizations.

   The expectation is that the mobile routes installed by NEMO can
   cohabit with a MANET support that would perform the RO inside the
   Nested Mobile Network. In other words, MIP redistributes its prefixes
   locally to a MANET and the MR-HA tunnel is bypassed.


6. General Considerations

6.1 Securing the protocol in nested tunnels optimization

   These approaches are generally difficult to secure unless all the
   Mobile Routers and Visiting Mobile Node belong to a same
   administrative domain and share predefined Security Associations.

   Even if an intermediate MR is 'trusted', this does not prove it is
   able to provide the necessary bandwidth, and may not provide a good
   service. Eventually, a MR that is capable of securing (IPSec) its
   traffic may select a Mobile Access Router based on quality of service
   heuristics as opposed as trust.

   The problem is global to the whole Mobile Network in the case of a
   MANET-based solution. For an RRH-based solution, the threat comes
   from on-axis MRs in the nested Mobile Network but is mostly limited
   to denial of service. This is detailed in [5]. The approach taken is
   to limit the threat to Black Hole and Grey Hole by using IPSec.

6.2 Recursive complexity in route optimization

   A number of drafts and publications suggest -or can be extended to- a
   model where the Home Agent and any arbitrary Correspondent would
   actually get individual binding from the chain of nested Mobile
   Routers, and form a routing header appropriately.

   An intermediate MR would keep track of all the pending communications
   between hosts in its subtree of Mobile Networks and their CNs, and a
   binding message to each CN each time it changes its point of
   attachment.

   If this was done, then each CN, by receiving all the binding messages
   and processing them recursively, could infer a partial topology of
   the nested Mobile Network, sufficient to build a multi-hop routing
   header for packets sent to nodes inside the nested Mobile Network.



Thubert, et al.         Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                RO-Taxonomy                  February 2004


   However, this extension has a cost:

   1.  Binding Update storm

       when one MR changes its point of attachment, it needs to send a
       BU to all the CNs of each node behind him. When the Mobile
       Network is nested, the number of nodes and relative CNs can be
       huge, leading to congestions and drops.

   2.  Protocol Hacks

       Also, in order to send the BUs, the MR has to keep track of all
       the traffic it forwards to maintain his list of CNs. In case of
       IPSec tunneled traffic, that CN information may not be available.

   3.  CN operation

       The computation burden of the CN becomes heavy, because it has to
       analyze each BU in a recursive fashion in order to infer nested
       Mobile Network topology required to build a multi hop routing
       header.

   4.  Missing BU

       If a CN doesn't receive the full set of PSBU sent by the MR, it
       will not be able to infer the full path to a node inside the
       nested Mobile Network.  The RH will be incomplete and the packet
       may or may not be delivered.

   5.  Obsolete BU

       If the Binding messages are sent asynchronously by each MR, then,
       when the relative position of MRs and/or the TLMR point of
       attachment change rapidly, the image of Mobile Network that the
       CN maintains is highly unstable. If only one BU in the chain is
       obsolete due to the movement of an intermediate MR, the
       connectivity may be lost.


6.3 Mobile Access router selection

   In some case, nested Mobile Networks attaches to visiting network
   with multiples mobile access router that are gateways to the global
   internet. These RO methods may cover the function in which how the MR
   in the nested Mobile Network choose the one of the mobile access
   routers.  This function is not explicitly described in current
   methods and needs to be discussed.

6.4 Mobility transparency and RO

   [cwng's interpretation of Mobility Transparency in RO]

   It is desirable in mobility-related protocols that the mobility of a
   mobile node is transparent to other entities and other layers in the
   mobile node.  The Basic NEMO support achieve this mobility
   transparency of the mobile network to the MNNs by a MR-HA tunnel so
   that MNNs need not be aware of the MR's change in point of
   attachment.

   Such a feature is, as mentioned, desirable.  However, when route
   optimizations, end-to-end principle, and other factors come into
   consideration, achieving mobility transparency may not be practical.

   For instance, to achieve nested tunnel optimizations, the mobility of
   the top-level MR is often exposed to other entities, such as the HA
   of a nested MR.   In the case of MR performing BU for MNNs, it might
   be necessary to pass mobility information of the MR to CN (and even
   MNN) in order not to break the end-to-end principle.  For the
   scenario of optimization using infrastructure, the mobility
   information might be necessarily exposed to correspondent routers or
   MAP.

   Thus, one should bear in mind when designing RO solution that a
   sacrifice might be necessary when weighing conflicting factors such
   as mobility transparency, optimization level, and end-to-end
   integrity.

   [Hosik's interpretation of Mobility Transparency in RO]

   In the case of extended support of NEMO such as nested NEMO, mobility
   transparency is desirable but that is not mandatory for the
   efficiency of the route optimization. For example, the notebook and
   PDA inside a vehicle can access to the Internet through the mobile
   router of the vehicle. In that case, if the movement of the vehicle
   affects to the notebook or the PDA, they can perform individual
   binding update operation to the correspondent node or its home agent
   but that can cause location privacy problem.

   [Onishi's interpretation of Mobility Transparency in RO]

   In RO solutions, MR can optimize the route between its own HA and MR.
   It is desirable that communication can not be interrupted by this
   route optimization.  ????

6.5 Multihoming Considerations

   In multihomed mobile networks, route optimization is dependant on how
   the connections to the Internet are available and selected.

   In case of macro mobility, we may have multiple HAs from place to
   place. New route optimization could be possible by routing between CN
   and one of the multiple Home Agents (possibly using differenc Home
   Addresses).

   When multiple connections are available for the purpose of fault
   tolerance, a selection mechanism is needed for CN to eveluate the
   connection availability in order to perform route optimization.


7. Conclusion

   The Problem space of Route Optimization in the NEMO context is
   multifold and can be split is several work areas. It will be
   critical, though, that the solution to a given piece of the puzzle be
   compatible and integrate smoothly with the others.

   Hopefully, the solutions will build on MIPv6 ([1]), as recommended by
   the NEMO Charter. On the other hand, MIPv6 seems to be evolving in a
   direction that makes it more and more difficult to provide a NEMO
   solution with backward compatibility, since:

   1) The RR test prevents a MR-LFN dichotomy on the Mobile Side,

   2) The RR test has no negotiable option and is not open for
   extension, and

   3) The HaO and RH type 2 are designed for a collocated CareOf
   Address. More specifically, they are not designed to be multi-hop as
   RRH is, and not extensible, though RRH can be considered as an
   extension of HAO.

   The authors intent is to trigger fruitful discussions that in turn
   will enhance our common understanding of the problem space so that at
   some point, this paper turns into a problem statement for the Nemo
   Route Optimization.
