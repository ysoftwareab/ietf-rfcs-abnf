Abstract

   L2TP [RFC2661] specifies a protocol for tunnelling PPP packets over
   packet based networks and over IP networks in particular. L2TP
   [RFC2661] supports remote access by ISDN and PSTN networks. This
   document augments the procedures described in [RFC2661] to further
   support ATM SVC or PVC based access networks. The extensions defined
   within this document allow for asymmetric bi-directional call
   establishment and service selection in the ATM access network.

1. Introduction

   L2TP [RFC2661] defines the procedures for tunneling PPP sessions
   between a so called L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and an L2TP
   Network Server (LNS). The main focus of [RFC2661] is on supporting
   HDLC based ISDN/PSTN access networks.

   This document augments the procedures described in [RFC2661] to
   further support ATM SVC or PVC based access networks. Support for ATM
   access networks requires extensions to the present L2TP procedures so
   as to cope with :

   (a) the traffic management aspects of ATM connections (e.g.
   assymetric bandwidth allocation and service category selection
   capabilities),

   (b) the addressing format to be used in switched ATM networks [AESA]
   and

   (c) the limititations imposed on LCP negotiation by transporting PPP
   over AAL5 over the access network segment of the PPP connection

Internet Draftdraft-ietf-l2tpext-atmext-rfc3301-bis-00.txt  January 2001


   [RFC2364].

   Within this draft, the necessary extensions to [RFC2661] are defined
   to cope with issues (a) and (b), issue (c) which is not specific to
   ATM may be solved as described in [L2TP_link].

1.1 Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Assumptions

   In this section we describe some assumptions that have lead to the
   extensions described in this draft.

2.1 Topology

   The procedures as defined in [RFC2661] apply mainly to access network
   technology such as PSTN and ISDN, which may be respectively
   asynchronous HDLC and synchronous HDLC based. The aim of this
   document is to extend L2TP support to allow for user / LAC
   communication based on ATM access network technology.

2.2 Connection Establishment

   Due to the wide variety of existing signalling protocols and ATM
   service categories, and their support or non-support within ATM based
   access networks, this document takes as approach to provide for a
   flexible identification of ATM connection characteristics while
   establishing outgoing and incoming L2TP calls. The procedures as
   defined within this document allow the allocation of asymmetric
   bandwidth and service category selection in terms of real or non-real
   time requirements on the ATM portion of the access network.

   As such, the detailed signalling protocol specific information
   elements that are necessary for switched VC service, are explicitly
   not negotiated during call establishment over the L2TP tunnel.

   In order to identify the endpoint of the ATM connection within the
   ATM access network, SVCs can be established on the basis of the ATM
   end system addressing format [AESA]. For PVC based services, the PVC
   can either be referred to by using the ATM end system addressing
   procedure (Called/Calling Number), or by making use of a textual name
   (Service Name). The latter is inspired by the procedures defined
   within [Auto_PVC].

Internet Draftdraft-ietf-l2tpext-atmext-rfc3301-bis-00.txt  January 2001


2.3 LCP negotiation

   The procedures described within this document may be combined with
   the procedures described in [L2TP_link] to limit LCP negotiation
   between LNS and user, so as to enforce PPP over AAL5 specific LCP
   negotiation [RFC2364].

3. ATM access enhanced procedures

   In order to illustrate the procedures specified within this document,
   this section will provide an operational description of Virtual
   dial-up access through an ATM based access network (e.g., ADSL). Note
   that the emphasis is on the changes proposed within this document
   relative to [RFC2661].

3.1 ATM connectivity

   Prior to initiating the PPP protocol layer, a Virtual Connection (VC)
   MUST be established between the user and the Network Access Server
   (LAC). This virtual connection MAY either be a preconfigured
   Permanent VC(PVC), where the access network provider, NAS and user
   agree beforehand on the characteristics of the PVC, or MAY be an on-
   demand switched VC(SVC), where the negotiation between user, network
   and NAS takes place by means of an ATM signalling protocol. Note that
   for establishing PVCs, alternative use may be made of the procedures
   as described in [Auto_PVC].

   In both cases, the user is referred to as the virtual dial-in user.

   Prior to accepting the switched connection from the virtual dial-in
   user, the LAC MAY check with the LNS whether the call should be
   accepted. In the latter situation, the LAC MAY determine based upon
   parameters available within the call establishment message that this
   concerns a virtual dial in user, or MAY undertake a partial
   authentication of the end system/user, in order to bind the end
   system/user with a specific LNS.

   For PVC based users, the LAC MAY be triggered by the arrival of an
   LCP Configure Request, or PPP Authentication request message from the
   virtual dial-in user to initiate conversation with the LNS. Note that
   the exact timing of triggering communication between LAC and LNS is
   outside the scope of this document.

3.2 Tunnel establishment

   If no tunnel connection currently exists to the desired LNS, one is
   initiated. During the tunnel establishment, LNS and LAC indicate
   bearer and framing capabilities to each other, according to normal



T'Joens, et al.            Expires July 2001                    [Page 4]

Internet Draftdraft-ietf-l2tpext-atmext-rfc3301-bis-00.txt  January 2001


   procedures.

   The bearer capability is extended to allow the LAC to indicate its
   support of ATM bearer devices. Positive receipt of this indication,
   allows both LAC and LNS to use the extensions as defined within this
   document to support ATM based incoming and outgoing calls.

3.3 call establishment

   During incoming and outgoing broadband call establishment, the
   following extensions are defined to existing procedures.

3.3.1 Incoming Call Establishment

   The ATM connection between the virtual Dial-in user and LAC MAY
   either be dynamically or statically established. When the VC
   connection is dynamically established (Switched VC), the LAC will
   receive a SETUP message over the interface that connects it to the
   ATM network. This specification does not assume any specific
   interface type (UNI or NNI). Permanent VC connections MAY either be
   manually configured, or configured by use of the extensions to the
   ILMI procedures as defined by [Auto_PVC].

   For switched VC connections, the LAC MAY select the peer LNS on the
   basis of connection establishment information, or by allowing partial
   PPP authentication of the virtual Dial-in user. The connection
   establishment information that can be used by the LAC include Called
   Party AESA, Called Party AESA Subaddress, Calling Party AESA or
   Calling Party AESA Subaddress.

   For Permanent VC connections, the LAC MAY be triggered by (a) the
   establishment of the PVC, (b) by an LCP configure request, (c) by
   partially authenticating the virtual Dial-in user, or (d) by means
   outside the scope of this specification.

   Within the ICRQ, the LAC connected to a compliant LNS MUST indicate a
   broadband bearer in the Bearer Type AVP (B bit set to 1), MAY include
   the Service Category AVP, and MAY include the Service Name AVP.
   Further, the ICRQ message MAY contain the VPI/VCI identifier AVP.
   This identifier can further be used at the LNS for management
   purposes next to or alternative to the Physical Channel ID AVP.

   In case the LAC is connected to a non-compliant LNS, it MAY use
   Digital bearer in the Bearer Type AVP (D bit set to 1) for session
   set up. Procedure for session set up continues as defined for digital
   calls.

   Within the ICCN, both Tx Connect Speed AVP and Rx Connect Speed

Internet Draftdraft-ietf-l2tpext-atmext-rfc3301-bis-00.txt  January 2001


   SHOULD be used if an assymetric connection has been established.

3.3.2 Outgoing Call Establishment

   Within an OCRQ, the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC minimum and maximum
   speeds for receive and transmit traffic (from the LAC perspective).
   This is to allow for the bi-directional asymmetric nature of ATM
   traffic contracts. Note that in order to support UBR connections
   between LAC and user, the Minimum BPS MUST be set to zero.

   Further during OCRQ, the LNS MAY include the required Service
   Category AVP, i.e., indicating real time (rt) or non-real time (nrt)
   transport services. The combination of minimum and maximum receive
   and transmit speed, and the indication of the required service
   category allows the LAC to establish an ATM connection according to
   its own capabilities, and the ATM access network capabilities,
   however within the service requirement for the PPP layer.

   Real time connectivity can be provided by either CBR or rt-VBR ATM
   service categories, non-real time connectivity can be provided by
   UBR, nrt-VBR, ABR or GFR ATM service categories.

   Further the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC in OCRQ message the called
   number according to the format described in this document (NSAP
   format). When the called number carries an all zero payload, the LAC
   SHOULD look at the Service Name AVP to bind the tunnel call to an ATM
   VC connection.

   Next to the normal AVPs, the OCRP message MAY contain the VPI/VCI
   identifier AVP. This identifier can further be used at the LNS for
   management purposes next to or alternative to the Physical Channel ID
   AVP.

3.4 Framing

   Within this document the PPP PDU refers to the concatenation of PPP
   protocol ID, PPP Information and PPP padding fields.

   In the direction of user to LNS, the PPP PDU will be carried on top
   of an AAL5 connection between user and LAC. The LAC MUST strip off
   the AAL5 specific fields based on the encapsulation mechanism in use
   on the ATM connection, i.e. VC multiplexed or LLC encapsulated
   [RFC2364], and MUST encapsulate the PPP PDU with address and control
   field, as per HDLC procedures, on the L2TP tunnel.

   In the direction of LNS to user, the PPP PDU will be carried on top
   of an AAL5 connection between LAC and user. The LAC MUST strip the
   PPP PDU from the address and control field on the L2TP tunnel, and

   insert the AAL5 specific fields based on the encapsulation mechanism
   in use on the ATM connection, i.e. VC multiplexed or LLC
   encapsulated.


4. Service model issues

4.1 Authentication

   In case of ATM switched VC establishment, calling party number
   information may be used for first level authentication much in the
   same way as for PSTN or ISDN access. In case of permanent VC
   establishment, authentication may not be an issue from the LAC side,
   because of the permanent character of the VC. Bilateral agreement
   between LAC and LNS providers may eliminate the authentication phase
   in the latter case.

4.2 Authorization

   Because of the flexibility of establishing ATM connections with
   varying parameters, some authorization may be required prior to
   accepting the establishment of a switched ATM connection from the
   user with certain ATM traffic parameters. This authorization may be
   performed against the ATM specific authentication information (e.g.
   calling line id), or may be performed after partial authentication of
   the user at the PPP level. Non authorized access requests result in
   connection release.

5. New and extended AVPs

5.1 New AVP Summary

   The following table lists the extra AVPs that are defined within this
   document. The "attr" column indicates the integer value assigned to
   this attribute.  Note that the attribute value is relative compared
   to the vendor ID. The "M" column indicates the setting of the
   "Mandatory" bit of the AVP header for each attribute. The "LEN"
   column indicates the size of the AVP including the AVP header. A "+"
   in this column indicates that the length varies depending upon the
   length of the actual contents of the value field.

   The usage list for each entry indicates the message types that
   utilize each AVP. An abbreviation shown in mixed or upper case
   letters indicates that the corresponding AVP MUST be present in this
   message type. All lower case indicates that the AVP MAY optionally
   appear in this message type. Some AVPs MAY be present only when a
   corresponding optional AVP or specific setting within the AVP is
   present, these AVPs are shown in lower case as well.

        The Calling Sub-Address AVP MUST be encoded as a 20 octet binary
        encoded NSAP address when the B bit is set in the Bearer Type
        AVP. The NSAP binary encoded address provides a broader range of
        address encapsulation methods than an ASCII field. The structure
        of the NSAP address (e.g., E.164, ICD, DCC) is defined in
        [AESA].

        The Calling Sub-Address number AVP MAY be present in ICRQ, and
        SHOULD only be available if the Calling Party number is also
        within the message.

        This AVP may be hidden (the H-bit may be 0 or 1). The M-bit for
        this AVP MUST be set to 0. The Length (before hiding) of this
        AVP is 26.

        The VPI/VCI identifier, Attribute Type tbd, encodes the VPI/VCI
        value used at the ATM interface at the LAC.

        The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

        The VPI/VCI identifier is a 32 bit value encoding the VPI(12
        bits) and VCI (16 bits) value.

        This AVP MAY be included within the ICRQ and OCRP, and SHOULD
        only be included when the LAC indicated broadband bearer support
        in the bearer capabilities AVP during tunnel establishment.

        This AVP may be hidden (the H-bit may be set to 0 or 1). The M-
        bit for this AVP must be set to 0. The Length (before hiding) of
        this AVP is 10.

        The bearer Capabilities AVP within a SCCRQ or SCCRP indicates
        the bearer capabilities that the sender of this message can
        provide for outgoing calls. This document extends the existing
        AVP with the B bit. If bit B is set, broadband access is
        supported (ATM).

        Attempts to establish an outgoing call with the bearer type set
        to B, while the bearer capability did not indicate this
        capability will result in the call being rejected with Result

        Code 5 'Call failed due to lack of appropriate facilities being
        available (permanent condition)'.

   (Tx) Minimum BPS

        The (Tx) Minimum BPS AVP encodes the lowest acceptable line
        speed for this call in the transmit direction. The (Tx) Minimum
        BPS AVP MAY be used in OCRQ. If the Rx Minimum BPS AVP, as
        defined within this document, is not available in the message,
        then symmetric transmission is implied, with both minimum
        receive and transmit bit-rates equal to Minimum BPS.

   (Tx) Maximum BPS

        (Tx) Maximum BPS AVP encodes the highest acceptable line speed
        for this call in the transmit direction. The (Tx) Maximum BPS
        AVP MAY be used in OCRQ. If the Rx Maximum BPS AVP, as defined
        within this document, is not available in the message, then
        symmetric transmission is implied, with both maximum receive and
        transmit bitrates equal to Maximum BPS.

   Bearer Type

        signalling messages, these cause codes can be found in ATM Forum
        UNI 4.0 [UNI] and the references thereof.  The Cause code should
        be interpreted relative to the Bearer Type in use for the
        specific call.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA to allocate 6 new type values for the
   following AVPs (see section 5.2) :

   - Rx Minimum BPS

   - Rx Maximum BPS

   - Service Category

   - Service Name



T'Joens, et al.            Expires July 2001                   [Page 16]

Internet Draftdraft-ietf-l2tpext-atmext-rfc3301-bis-00.txt  January 2001


   - Calling Sub-Address

   - VPI/VCI Identifier

   This document further defines a new bit (B) in the bearer
   capabilities and bearer type AVPs (section 5.3).

   This document defines a flag field in the Service Category AVP, only
   one bit in this flag has been assigned within this document (S).
   Further assignments fall under the rule of "Specification Required",
   i.e. Values and their meaning must be documented in an RFC or other
   permanent and readily available reference, in sufficient detail so
   that interoperability between independent implementations is
   possible.

7. Security Considerations

   No extra security risk outside these specified by [RFC2661] are
   foreseen.

8. Acknowledgements
