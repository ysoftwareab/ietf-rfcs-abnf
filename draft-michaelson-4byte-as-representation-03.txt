Abstract

   A single textual representation for four-octet Autonomous System (AS)
   numbers is defined.  The syntax chosen avoids collision with Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) community string parsing of AS numbers.  It is
   recommended that this textual representation be used by all
   documents, systems and user interfaces referring to four-octet AS
   numbers.

1.  Introduction

   A single textual representation for four-octet Autonomous System (AS)
   numbers is defined.  The syntax chosen avoids collision with Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) community string parsing of AS numbers.

   A number of forms of representation have been discussed in various
   routing forums, and this document provides a taxonomy of the various
   representations that have been considered, and recommends the
   adoption of a textual representation scheme termed "asdot" notation.

   It is recommended that only this "asdot" textual representation be
   used by all documents, systems and user interfaces referring to four-
   octet AS numbers.

2.  Terminology

   asplain
      refers to a syntax scheme of representing all AS numbers using
      decimal integer notation.  Using asplain notation an AS number of
      value 65526 would be represented as the string "65526" and as AS
      number of value 65546 would be represented as the string "65546".


   asdot+
      refers to a syntax scheme of representing all AS numbers using a
      notation of two integer values joined by a period character: <
      high order 16-bit value in decimal > . < low order 16-bit value in
      decimal >.  Using asdot+ notation, an AS number of value 65526
      would be represented as the string "0.65526" and as AS number of
      value 65546 would be represented as the string "1.10".


   asdot
      refers to a syntax scheme of representing AS number values less
      than 65536 using asplain notation and representing AS number
      values equal to or greater than 65536 using asdot+ notation.
      Using asdot notation, an AS number of value 65526 would be
      represented as the string "65526" and as AS number of value 65546
      would be represented as the string "1.10".


   four-octet AS numbers
      refers to AS numbers in the range 0.0 - 65535.65535 (using asdot+
      notation), or 0 - 4294967295 (using asplain notation).  Four-octet
      AS numbers are defined in [RFC4893]


   four-octet only AS numbers
      refers to AS numbers in the range 1.0 - 65535.65535 (using asdot+
      notation) or 65536 - 4294967295 (using asplain notation)


   two-octet only AS numbers
      refers to AS numbers in the range 0.0 - 0.65535 (using asdot+
      notation), or 0 - 65535 (using asplain notation).

3.  Representation of AS Number Values

   To avoid confusion, a single textual notation is useful for
   documentation, configuration systems, reports, and external tools and
   information repositories, but it is also necessary to observe that
   any recommendation that changes existing use would represent an
   unwarranted imposition.

   The asdot representation represents a reasonable compromise in that
   it preserves the current convention of using an asplain
   representation for two-octet only AS number values, and proposes
   using the asdot+ notation for four-octet only AS numbers.

   All systems that generate reports containing AS numbers MUST use this
   asdot notation to represent the AS number value.

   Interfaces that accept AS number values MUST accept asdot notation by
   default, and SHOULD also be capable of correctly values expressed in
   asplain and asdot+ notation.

4.  Consideration of Approaches to AS number representation

   Initially, the ":" was proposed to separate the two-octet components
   for the four-octet AS number value.

   It was noted that this representation clashes with use of the ":"
   character in community attribute syntax in BGP and and the
   representation of AS numbers in BGP community attributes would be
   ambiguous as a result of this notation.

   It has also been pointed out that Routing Protocol Specification
   Language (RPSL) [RFC2622] [RFC4012] AS-Set objects use the ":"
   character to denote sequences of AS objects forming a chain.  Since
   the AS object would have had the ":" character embedded in the
   instance name, this would have required double-parsing to find four-
   octet AS number in AS-Set chains.  This also is not acceptable.

   It was also noted that AS numbers are used by network operations
   staff, and the larger values in the four-octet AS number set
   introduces the increased risk of transcription error with these
   numbers.

   The asdot representation does not present these problems.

5.  IANA Considerations

   [Note: not for publication.  No changes are proposed for the IANA, as
   the IANA AS number registry,
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/as-numbers, already uses asdot
   notation.]

6.  Acknowledgements

   The text of the definition of a four-octet AS is taken from
   [RIPE2005-12]

   The terminology of "asplain", "asdot" and "asdot+" was originally
   devised and described by Juergen Kammer in January 2007 [KAMMER2007]

   The authors thank Rudiger Volk, Joao Damas, Joe Abley, Peter Koch and
   Henk Uijterwaal for feedback and extensive comments on this document.

7.  Implementation Notes

   Many programming languages treat xxx.yyy numeric strings as real
   number values on input, and convert the value internally to a
   canonical floating point representation.  Since the precision cannot
   be guaranteed to be preserved, this risks changing the value of the
   four-octet quantity on output, or by mis-placed arithmetical
   calculation.

   Care must be taken that asdot notation strings are treated as
   'special-purpose strings' on input and output, and parsed correctly
   to a four-octet quantity.  It would be sensible to draft suitable
   function definitions to define the transform from presentation to
   internal value, as was done for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with the
   inet_pton() and inet_ntop() functions.

   The [RFC2622] and [RFC4012] specifications, and systems which
   manipulate AS numbers need to be reviewed for conformance with asdot
   textual representation, and for the syntactic implications of this
   representation.

8.  Changes since the -01 draft

   An IANA Considerations section has been added to amend an existing
   registry.

   The document now clarifies that it refers to a textual
   representation, the binary representation used on-the-wire is
   unaffected by this draft.

9.  Changes since the -02 draft

   The terms "asplain", "asdot" and "asdot+" have been used, reflecting
   current discussion on this topic.

   An IANA Considerations section has been removed as the AS number
   registry uses asdot notation.
