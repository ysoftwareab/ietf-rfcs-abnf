               IPv6 Transitional Technology IPv4 Prefix 
                      draft-byrne-v6ops-clatip-01


Abstract

   DS-Lite [RFC6333] directs IANA to reserve 192.0.0.0/29 for the B4
   element.  This memo generalizes that reservation to include other
   cases where a non-routed IPv4 interface must be numbered in an IPv6
   transition solution.

INTERNET DRAFT          Transitional IPv4 Prefix       December 28, 2013


1  Introduction

   DS-Lite [RFC6333] directs IANA to reserve 192.0.0.0/29 for the B4
   element.  This memo generalizes that IANA reservation to include
   other cases where a non-routed IPv4 interface must be numbered in an
   IPv6 transition solutions.  IANA shall list 192.0.0.0/29 to be
   reserved for IPv6 Transitional Technology IPv4 Prefix.  The result is
   that 192.0.0.0/29 may be used in any system that requires IPv4
   addresses for backward compatibility with IPv4 communications, but
   does not emit IPv4 packets "on the wire".

2  The Case of 464XLAT

   464XLAT [RFC6877] describes an architecture for providing IPv4
   communication over an IPv6-only access network.  One of the methods
   described in [RFC6877] is for the client side translator (CLAT) to be
   embedded in the host, such as a smartphone.  In this scenario, the
   host must have an IPv4 address configured to present to the network
   stack and for applications to bind sockets.

3.  Choosing 192.0.0.0/29

   To avoid conflicts with any other network that may communicate with
   the CLAT, a locally unique address must be assigned.

   IANA has defined a well-known range, 192.0.0.0/29, in [RFC6333],
   which is dedicated for DS-lite.  As defined in [RFC6333], this subnet
   is only present between the B4 and the AFTR and never emits packets
   from this prefix "on the wire".  464XLAT has the same need for a non-
   routed IPv4 prefix.  It is most prudent and effective to generalize
   192.0.0.0/29 for the use of supporting IPv4 interfaces in IPv6
   transition technologies rather than reserving a prefix for every
   possible solution.

4  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations beyond what is described [RFC6333] and
   [RFC6877].


5  IANA Considerations

   IANA is directed to generalize the reservation of 192.0.0.0/29 from
   DS-lite to "IPv6 Transitional Technology IPv4 Prefix".
