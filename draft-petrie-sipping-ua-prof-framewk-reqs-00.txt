1 Abstract 
    
   This document attempts to identify the requirements for a protocol 
   framework to provide SIP user and device profiles to SIP user 
   agents.  The objective is not to invent new special purpose 
   protocols, but to identify the requirements such that a rational 
   decision can be made as to what existing protocol(s) should be used 
   to solve the problem of providing user and device profiles to SIP 
   user agents.  This document also contains an evaluation of a set of 
   applicable protocols.

3 Overview 
    
    
    
3.1 Background 
 
   There is a general need to standardize methods for adding, enabling, 
   and maintaining user and device profiles used by SIP user agents 
   within a VoIP system. When one considers the effort needed to set up 
   systems with hundreds or thousands of users and user agents, the 
   need for reducing set up time is obvious. After a system is set up, 
   ongoing maintenance in the form of changing the user and device 
   profiles on a large population of user agents, is likely to be 
   necessary and requires a similar administrative effort. 
    
   In addition to these scaling problems, it is likely that the 
   population of user agents in any given VoIP system will be 
   heterogeneous: the configuration strategy must be flexible enough to 
   accommodate different needs for different users. Consequently, for 
   VoIP system administration sanity and cost practicality, a multi-
   vendor profile delivery standard is needed. 
   This requirements document and protocol evaluation is a more 
   formalized update to previous work in progress (e.g. expired draft 
   draft-petrie-sip-config-framewk-reqs-00.txt) and evaluation 
   performed by the authors. 
    
3.2 Functional Groups 
    
   The requirements for the configuration of a SIP user agent can be 
   divided into the following high-level functions: 
    
      ¸ 
       Discovery 
      ¸ 
       Enrollment 
      ¸ 
       Profile Retrieval 
      ¸ 
       Change Notification 
      ¸ 
       Profile Upload 
      ¸ 
       Security 
      ¸ 
       Data Container 
    
   These functional groups are intended only to provide a means to 
   think about and organize the requirements. They are not required to 
   be discrete steps, and they are not intended to dictate a specific 
   model.  
    
   Discovery û is the means by which a new SIP user agent can 
   automatically discover how and where to enroll and retrieve desired 
   device and user profile(s). 
    
   Enrollment û is the means by which the user agent makes the profile 
   server(s) aware of its presence and desire of specific users and/or 
   device profiles.

   Profile Retrieval û is the means by which the user agent gets the 
   desired profiles(s). 
    
   Change Notification û is the means by which the profile server tells 
   the user agent that profiles of interest have changed.  Typically 
   the intension would be for the user agent to get those changes or 
   updated profiles. 
    
   Profile Upload û this is the means by which the user agent or other 
   entities in the network can update or propagate changes to a profile 
   on the server. 
    
   Security û primarily the focus is on protecting the profiles from 
   unauthorized access or change as well as integrity. 
    
   Data Container û the container or object model for the profile data 
   during transport to and from the server.  The primary issues are 
   structure and hierarchy.   
    
       Note: The specific content is considered out of scope in this 
       document.  The content requirements are addressed in [EP-
       CONFIG].  Ideally the container would be considered with the 
       content requirements instead of the profile retrieval 
       requirements.  However as some of the protocols evaluated have 
       an inherent data container the requirements are included in this 
       document to keep the comparison on an apples-to-apples basis. 
    
3.3 Terminology 
    
   This document uses the following terminology: 
    
   Server or Profile Server û the server(s) that provide the profile 
   delivery framework functions defined above. 
    
   User Agent or Device û the client wishing to get or update the user 
   or device profile(s) as defined by the above functional framework. 
    
4 Requirements 
    
   The requirements are categorized by the functional groups defined in 
   3.2.  In addition a general set requirements are defined up front.  
   Each requirement is given a unique identifier for cross referencing. 
    
4.1 General 
    
   This section contains miscellaneous requirements across all 
   functional groups. 
4.1.1 Roaming 
    
   GENRREQ-1: The profile delivery framework MUST support the ability 
   for profiles to roam.   
    


 
Petrie/Mahy            Exp: Dec. 2002 [Page 4] 
                                xxxxx 
 
   That is, a user may go to another user agent within the serverÆs 
   domain and with proper authorization, the user agent must be able to 
   retrieve from the server and use the userÆs profile. 
    
4.1.2 Open and Extensible for Vendor 
    
   GENOREQ-10: The profile framework MUST allow vendor differentiation 
   on both the server and user agent sides. 
    
       This is largely an issue of how easy it is to make a more 
       intelligent or active server or client without breaking the 
       standard. 
        
   GENOREQ-11: The profile server MUST be able to opaquely support 
   vendor extensions to profiles. 
    
       That is the server should be able to handle uploading of vendor 
       specific data in a profile without requiring a new profile 
       definition or schema. 
        
4.1.3 NAT/Firewall Support 
    
   There are two primary models in which VoIP systems are deployed: 
    
      ¸ 
       Hosted VoIP Services ("Centrex" Model) 
      ¸ 
       Locally Administered VoIP systems ("PBX" Model) 
    
   In the extreme case of a hosted model, the only customer premises 
   equipment is the LAN and user agents.  In the locally administered 
   model all equipment, servers, gateways and user agents are on the 
   local premises.  There is of course a spectrum of variations 
   between.  In addition there are multi-site enterprise deployments 
   that in some aspects may appear more like the hosted model.  The 
   user agent in either model may be present in an commercial or in a 
   residential environment. 
    
   The primary issue relating to the profile delivery framework is the 
   presence of NATs and/or firewalls between the profile server and the 
   user agent.  It is assumed that if NATs or firewalls are present (in 
   between) the user agents are on the inside and the profile server is 
   effectively on the outside (e.g. public Internet). 
    
   GENNREQ-20: The user agent MUST be able to reach the profile server 
   through a NAT or firewall to perform all of the functions in the 
   delivery framework. 
    
   GENNREQ-21: The firewall or NAT SHOULD not require any additional 
   configuration to enable the profile delivery framework to work. 
    
       It is assumed that certain protocols are typically enabled on 
       the NAT or firewall by default (e.g. HTTP access to servers 
       outside).  It is assumed that SIP access in both directions is 
       enabled or the user agent is not likely to be of much use.

4.1.4 Availability of Development Tools 
    
   The platforms (server and user agent) upon which this profile 
   delivery framework must be deployed are very different in 
   capability.  The user agents are largely embedded systems with 
   limited resources for code and data size as well as CPU power (pure 
   software based user agents are less constrained).  The profile 
   server is likely to run on general purpose servers and therefore not 
   as resource constrained.   
    
   For wide spread adoption of the profile delivery system, the tools 
   protocol implementations required to build the profile server should 
   be readily available. 
    
   GENAREQ-30: The protocol stack implementations needed to build a 
   profile server SHOULD be commercially and/or publicly available, 
   preferably with reference or open-source implementations available. 
    
   GENAREQ-31: There SHOULD be multiple implementations of the protocol 
   stacks required in the profile server readily available. 
    
   GENAREQ-32: There SHOULD be multiple implementations of the protocol 
   stacks required in the user agent readily available. 
    
   GENAREQ-33: There SHOULD be multiple implementations of the protocol 
   stacks required in the user agent suitable for embedded systems. 
    
    
    
4.2 Discovery 
    
   The purpose of discovery is to provide the means by which zero or 
   minimal user interaction is required when plugging in a user agent 
   for the first time in a specific profile server domain.  It is 
   likely that there is no single protocol solution for discovery due 
   to the wide variety of typical network configurations including but 
   not limited to networks: 
       not connected to the Internet 
       with no DHCP server 
       with no DNS SRV support 
       with a non-configurable DNS server 
    
   DISREQ-1: The user agent SHOULD be able to discover the profile 
   server without human input. 
    
   DISREQ-2: It MUST be possible to manually set the location of the 
   profile server for a user agent. 
    
       This is primarily a user agent implementation issue not a 
       protocol issue. 
    
    
4.3 Enrollment 
    
 
Petrie/Mahy            Exp: Dec. 2002 [Page 6] 
                                xxxxx 
 
   ENREQ-1: A user agent must be able to provide a unique identity to 
   the profile server which does not change for the life of the UA. 
    
       This allows user and device profiles to be associated with a 
       particular user agent. 
    
   ENREQ-2: A user agent requiring profiles SHOULD make itself known to 
   the profile server.  
    
   ENREQ-3: The user agent MUST identify profiles that it requires. 
    
   ENREQ-4: The profile server MAY be provisioned to know what profiles 
   a user agent needs by default. 
    
       There are a number of reasons for the above requirements.  In 
       large scale deployments this may be important for load balancing 
       purposes. This may be needed by the profile server so that it 
       can understand which user agents are dependent upon which 
       profiles. 
    
   ENREQ-5: A user agent MAY request additional or different user 
   profiles beyond the default provisioned for the user agent. 
    
       This is primarily to support the notion of roaming. 
    
   ENREQ-6: The user agent MUST provide specific information which may 
   needed by the server to customize the profile(s) for the user agent. 
    
       It may be necessary to provide different views of a profile 
       based upon the specific configuration of the user agent. (for 
       example, Vendor, Model number, Software or firmware version, 
       serial number, MAC address, etc.). 
    
   ENREQ-7: It SHOULD be possible for the profile server to deliver 
   different views of a profile based upon characteristics of the user 
   agent. 
    
       Though the objective is to provide a standardized profile that 
       has the same content for all vendors user agents, in reality 
       there are changes or differences to work around.  That is it may 
       be desirable to put intelligence in the profile server to work 
       around differences in user agent behavior or changes in the 
       standardized profile content specification. 
    
   ENREQ-8: It MUST be possible to reassigned device-specific profiles, 
   stored in the server, to a different user agent. 
     
       This is to facilitate hardware swap out. 
    
   ENREQ-9: It MUST be possible for the profile server, over time, to 
   change the location(s) from which configuration data is retrieved. 
    
       The intension is to allow server handoff as the result of 
       failure, administration changes, load balancing, etc.

                                xxxxx 
 
    
   ENREQ-10: The user agent SHOULD re-enroll periodically. 
    
       The user agent basically should check in periodically with the 
       profile server in case a network problem prevented change 
       notification from getting to the user agent. 
    
4.4 Profile Retrieval 
    
   PRREQ-1: It MUST be possible for the user agent to retrieve the 
   profile(s) it requires on demand. 
    
   PRREQ-2: It MUST be possible for the entire population of user 
   agents to request and retrieve the required profiles in a short 
   period of time.   
    
       This is a scalability requirement: e.g. during a power outage 
       tens or hundreds of thousands of user agents may power up at 
       once. 
    
    
    
4.5 Change Notification 
    
   CNREQ-1: The profile server MUST be able to notify dependent user 
   agents of profile changes. 
    
   CNREQ-2: The user agent MUST be able to get the new updated profile. 
    
   CNREQ-3: The server MAY specify in advance that a configuration 
   change is to occur. 
    
       That is the profile server may schedule changes. 
        
   CNREQ-4:  The user agent MAY defer making profile changes effective 
   until it is safe to do so. 
    
       Some profile changes may disrupt the operation of the user 
       agent.  The user agent should use discretion as to whether the 
       change will disrupt critical operation (e.g. a call) of the user 
       agent. [Should there be a means of specifying immediate or when 
       safe?] 
    
4.6 Profile Upload 
    
   PUREQ-1: A user agent MUST be able to upload changes to a profile on 
   the profile server. 
    
       This is to facilitate changes made either via a user interface 
       on the user agent which are desired to be permanent as well as a 
       means by which a external interface (e.g. a rich GUI on a 
       general purpose computer)  may interface with the profile 
       server.

                                xxxxx 
 
   PUREQ-2: The profile server should provide an access control 
   mechanism to constrain who can read, write, delete, or by 
   notified about change to profile data. 
    
4.7 Security 
    
   User and device profiles may contain sensitive data such as 
   passwords and identities.  It MUST be possible to protect the 
   profiles and information about the profiles. 
    
   SECREQ-1: The profile server SHOULD not provide access to profile 
   data without authentication and authorization. 
    
   SECREQ-2: The profile server MUST not allow a user agent to update 
   profile data without authentication and authorization. 
    
   SECREQ-3: The profile data, when transmitted over the network, 
   SHOULD be protected against man in the middle attacks and snooping. 
    
   SECREQ-4: The profile server SHOULD not allow enrollment without 
   authentication and authorization. 
    
   SECREQ-5: The profile server SHOULD not provide change notification 
   of profiles without authentication and authorization. 
    
   SECREQ-6: The user agent SHOULD not interact with or trust any 
   information from the profile server before authenticating the 
   profile server. 
    
   SECREQ-7: The information exchanged between the user agent and the 
   profile server SHOULD be integrity protected. 
    
    
4.8 Data Container 
    
   DAREQ-1: The data container MUST support hierarchical and structured 
   date.  Note: for a better understanding of rational for this 
   requirement see [EP-CONFIG] 
    
   DAREQ-2: It MUST be possible to define a standardized set of profile 
   data that all user agents SHOULD support. 
    
   DAREQ-3: It MUST be possible for user agent vendors to add vendor 
   specific data without breaking the standardized data set or 
   requiring the creation of additional profiles. 
    
   DAREQ-4: The data container MUST be flexible enough to contain 
   additional data without breaking the profile server or the user 
   agent. 
    
       e.g. non-standard, vendor specific or standard updates 
    
   DAREQ-5: The user agent must be able to determine the differences 
   when a profile has changed.

       Note: this can be either by getting only the added, removed or 
       changed data or by calculating the difference between two 
       profiles. 
        
5 Protocol Evaluation 
    
   The following set of protocols are those that have been suggested 
   for the purpose of SIP user agent profile delivery framework both on 
   the SIP and SIPPING mailing lists as well as at past work group 
   meetings.    
    
       SNMP 
       LDAP 
       ACAP 
       SLP 
       SIP Events 
       HTTP 
       DHCP Options 
       DNS 
       XML 
       RFC 822 
    
   This is of course not an exhaustive list of possible protocols, but 
   a pragmatic list.   
    
    
5.1 Evaluation Criteria 
    
   The requirements defined in section 4 define a set of criteria for 
   by which protocols may be evaluated for use in the profile delivery 
   framework.   
    
   The following table indicates the functional area for which the 
   protocols are considered.  This table indicates which requirements 
   will be evaluated for each of the protocols.  As no single protocol 
   provides all of the functional areas, the objective is to find a 
   small set of protocols that will best satisfy the requirements.  All 
   protocols are evaluated against the general requirements in section 
   4.1.   
    
                      SNMP LDAP ACAP SLP  HTTP SIP  XML  822  DHCP DNS 
   Discovery                          X                        X    X  
    
   Enrollment          X         X    X         X 
    
   Profile Retrieval   X    X    X         X    
    
   Change Notification X         X              X 
    
   Profile Upload      X    X    X         X 
    
   Security            X    X    X    X    X    X

   Data Container      X    X    X                   X    X 
    
    
   In each of the following subsections to section 5 a general over 
   evaluation is made of the protocol.  In addition the requirements 
   which are NOT satisfied fully or as well as other protocols are 
   explicitly listed or discussed.  Those requirements that are 
   satisfied are generally not explicitly called out or listed. 
    
5.2 SNMP 
    
   SNMPv3 [SNMP] is evaluated and referred to as SNMP in this document.  
   SNMP has no discovery mechanism.  
    
   General 
    
   There are two aspects of the roaming requirement (GENRREQ-1), 
   neither of which are solved very well by SNMP.   
       - Physical relocation of a user agent in a different LAN 
       - Users moving to a different user agent which subsequently 
       requires a new user profile 
    
   It is very difficult to support a user whose preferences are stored 
   outside the local management domain.  This physical relocation of a 
   user agent (e.g. user agent on a laptop in a visited LAN) is a very 
   desirable scenario.  Because of its security model, SNMP does not 
   work very well outside of its local domain. 
    
   To support a user (one or more) temporarily using a user agent, the 
   user agent would have to support the access of multiple, variable 
   user profiles.  MIBs do support the ability to have arrays or 
   multiple instances of an object (typically leaf nodes).  However 
   MIBs do not support multiple instances of a hierarchy (e.g. multiple 
   user profiles each with a hierarchy of content). 
    
   It is difficult to make an active SNMP server.  SNMP is primarily a 
   push model.  It is difficult to make an intelligent profile server 
   where traps are not designed into the standard profile MIB (GENOREQ-
   10).  
     
   MIBs have a very rigid schema that makes it difficult to add vendor 
   specific data without breaking the MIB or having to create a new MIB 
   (GENOREQ-11).  Supporting the vendor differentiation through MIBs 
   would make management difficult. 
    
   SNMP will not work through a NAT or firewall by default.  It is also 
   likely that a firewall administrator will have serious concerns 
   letting SNMP traffic through their firewall. 
    
   Enrollment 
    
   ENREQ-5 has the same issues with multiple user profiles as described 
   above for general requirement GENRREQ-1. 
    
 
Petrie/Mahy            Exp: Dec. 2002 [Page 11] 
                                xxxxx 
 
   ENREQ-7 has the same issues as GENOREQ-10 and GENOREQ-11 described 
   above. 
    
   Profile Retrieval 
    
   As SNMP uses a push model, the user agent must throw a trap or 
   inform to tell the server to push a profile to the user agent.  In 
   addition the issue with multiple user profiles, described above with 
   GENRREQ-1, make it difficult to satisfy PRREQ-1. 
    
   SNMP does not scale very well to individual dynamic nodes.  It is 
   difficult to build a system managing more than tens of thousands of 
   users.  User agents from some vendors do not have sufficient 
   persistent memory to store a whole user or device profile.  After a 
   power outage tens or hundreds of thousands of user agents would all 
   power up, throw traps requesting profiles. 
    
   The push model of SNMP make it difficult to make changes from the 
   user agent (PUREQ-2).  A solution perhaps could be built using a 
   trap.  However this would not enable other entities (non-user 
   agents) to set profile data. 
    
   Change Notification 
    
   There is no delayed setting of MIB data.  A SNMP agent either 
   accepts the change or rejects it immediately (CNREQ-3 and CNREQ-4). 
    
   Data Container 
   DAREQ-3 and DAREQ-4 are not well supported due to the rigid nature 
   of MIBs described above relative to GENOREQ-11. 
    
    
5.3 LDAP 
    
   The authors did not have sufficient time to complete a thorough 
   evaluation of LDAP.   
    
5.4 ACAP 
    
   General 
 
   ACAP was not designed to be active on the server side.  It has more 
   of a database model.  It is probably possible to make the data 
   access active or intelligent, however this is make more difficult by 
   the lack of implementations (GENOREQ-10). 
    
   ACAP [ACAP] over TLS [ACAP-TLS] is evaluated to satisfy the security 
   requirements.  The authors were not able to find a commercially or 
   publicly available version of ACAP written in C, C++ or Java 
   (GENAREQ-30, GENAREQ-31, GENAREQ-32, GENAREQ-33). 
    
   ACAP does not support any discovery mechanism and was not evaluated 
   for this functional area. 
    
 
Petrie/Mahy            Exp: Dec. 2002 [Page 12] 
                                xxxxx 
 
   Enrollment 
    
   Due to the difficulty of making the profile server active for 
   Change Notification (as described above in the general requirements 
   evaluation of ACAP), it is also difficult to provide different views 
   of data based upon characteristics of the user agent (ENREQ-7).  The 
   different views would have to be designed into the schema requiring 
   coordination on both the user agent and server sides. 
    
   Without an event mechanism (see below) or a means to redirect 
   profile data requests to another server it is difficult to re-assign 
   a user agent to an alternative ACAP server (ENREQ-9). 
    
   Change Notification 
    
   ACAP does not support an event mechanism.  It uses a polling model.  
   This makes it difficult to make profile data changes effective 
   immediately.  A very short polling time must be used which does not 
   scale well with large numbers of user agents.  Alternatively with a 
   longer pooling period, user agents will be slow to make the profile 
   changes effective (CNREQ-1, CNREQ-2, CNREQ-3 and CNREQ-4). 
    
   Profile Retrieval 
    
   ACAP meets the requirements for profile retrieval. 
    
   Profile Upload 
    
   ACAP provides a means of updating the profile data with access 
   control. 
    
   Security 
    
   Security is provided via TLS. 
    
   Data Container 
    
   ACAP does have a rich hierarchal structure for containing profile 
   data.  In addition it has a powerful means of describing access 
   control and modification time stamping of data. 
    
5.5 SLP 
    
   SLP [SLP] is primarily a LAN based solution for discovery of 
   services.  It allows the discovery of URL or server and port for a 
   well named service.  SLP is not appropriate for profile retrieval, 
   change notification or profile update.  Nor does it provide a data 
   container. 
    
   General 
    
   As SLP is primarily for LAN based discovery where roaming 
   functionality is not applicable (GENRREQ-1).  Likewise vendor 

 
Petrie/Mahy            Exp: Dec. 2002 [Page 13] 
                                xxxxx 
 
   differentiation in the server and user agent are less applicable 
   (GENOREQ-10 and GENOREQ-11).  
    
   It is difficult to make SLP work through NATs or firewalls (GENNREQ-
   20, GENNREQ-21). 
    
    
    
   Enrollment 
    
   The ability to provision or create active responses to user agent 
   request makes ENREQ-3, ENREQ-4, ENREQ-5 and ENREQ-6 more 
   appropriately performed with protocols other than SLP. 
    
   As SLP does not get involved with the profile retrieval, update or 
   change notification enrollment requirements: ENREQ-7, ENREQ-8, 
   ENREQ-9 and ENREQ-10 are not applicable to SLP. 
    
   Security 
    
   For the above reason security requirements: SECREQ-1, SECREQ-2, 
   SECREQ-3 and SECREQ-5 are also not applicable. 
    
   SLP does not authenticate or authorize the user agent.  It assumes 
   that is preformed by the server performing the profile retrieval, 
   upload and change notification functions (SECREQ-4). 
    
5.6 SIP Events 
    
   The only appropriate use of SIP is for its event mechanism [SIP-
   EVENTS].  SIP is evaluated assuming SIPS and S/MIME [SIP] support 
   for the security functionality.  SIP provides a very powerful event 
   framework through the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages. 
    
   SIP is not appropriate for profile retrieval or upload.  It is not a 
   data transport protocol.  Nor does SIP provide a data container.  
   SIP does support multicast that could be used as a discovery 
   mechanism.  However it is not evaluated for discovery features. 
    
   General 
    
   The primary requirement for vendor differentiation is in the 
   enrollment, profile retrieval, update and change notification.  SIP 
   does allow active server and client side components.  However this 
   is not considered necessary for this requirement (GENOREQ-10) and 
   considered not applicable. 
    
   As SIP is not consider appropriate for profile retrieval or upload 
   it is consider not applicable to GENOREQ-11. 
    
   Enrollment 
    
   The SIP SUBSCRIBE mechanism of [SIP-EVENTS] satisfies all of the 
   enrolloment functional requirements. 
 
Petrie/Mahy            Exp: Dec. 2002 [Page 14] 
                                xxxxx 
 
    
   Change Notification 
    
   CNREQ-2 is not applicable to SIP.  It is more related to the profile 
   retrieval mechanism used. 
    
   The deferral of making profile changes effective is a user agent 
   implementation issue in the context of [SIP-EVENTS].  CNREQ-4 is 
   considered to be not applicable to SIP. 
    
   Security 
    
   As SIP is not proposed as a data transport for profile data SECREQ-2 
   and SECREQ-3 are not applicable. 
    
   The security capabilities of [SIP] are considered to satisfy the 
   other security requirements. 
    
5.7 HTTP 
    
   HTTP [HTTP] is considered for the purpose of transporting the data 
   profiles (profile retrieval and upload).  To satisfy the security 
   requirements [HTTPS] is assumed. 
    
   General 
    
   As HTTP is used primarily for transport GENOREQ-11 is consider to be 
   non-applicable.  However active HTTP pages could be used to help 
   support this requirement. 
    
   Enrollment  
    
   Enrollment is considered to be mostly not applicable to the proposed 
   use of HTTP.  However ENREQ-7  can be satisfied as part of profile 
   retrieval.  This would require active pages on the profile server. 
    
   Profile Retrieval 
    
   HTTP satisfies all of the profile retrieval requirements. 
    
   Change Notification 
    
   Enrollment is considered to be mostly not applicable to the proposed 
   use of HTTP.  However CNREQ-2 can be satisfied as profile retrieval.   
    
   Profile Upload 
    
   HTTP provides gross level access control of profile.  However to get 
   atomic level access control on elements of the profile data requires 
   the development of active pages on the profile server (PUREQ-2). 
    
   Security

   The discovery solution is best addressed separately.  Due to the 
   varied nature of most network environments, there is no single 
   solution that will work everywhere.  It is probably necessary to 
   support multiple protocols.  Due to the widespread deployment and 
   use of DHCP and DNS they are the best two candidates for discovery, 
   although SLP can be used in network that already support it. 
    
   The data container requirements are equally satisfied by XML and 
   ACAP largely due to their ability to support an extensible, 
   hierarchal schema.  XML seems to have an advantage as well based on 
   the wide spread availability of development tools that operate on 
   XML.  Both ACAP and HTTP address the profile retrieval and upload 
   requirements, although the relative maturity of XML over HTTP is 
   very attractive. 
    
   SIP is the only protocol that addressed all the relevant enrollment 
   and change control requirements.There was no single protocol that 
   satisfied all of the requirements in the other functional areas.  
   However a combination of HTTP and SIP satisfies all of the remaining 
   requirements to a high degree.  In addition the large number of 
   implementations and development tools make this combination the most 
   attractive solution.  The development as well as end user (e.g. 
   administrator) skill sets are much more readily available for these 
   protocols as well.  As a second choice ACAP and SIP seems to be the 
   only other reasonable combination.
