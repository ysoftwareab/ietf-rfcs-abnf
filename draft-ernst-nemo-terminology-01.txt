Abstract

   This document proposes a terminology for defining network mobility
   problems and solution requirements. Network mobility occurs when an
   entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and
   thus its reachability in the topology, which is referred to as a
   mobile network.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Network Mobility Support Terminology     November 2002


 1. Introduction

   A mobile network is an entire network, moving as a unit, which
   changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its
   reachability in the topology. A mobile network may be composed by one
   or more IP-subnets and is connected to the global Internet via one or
   more Mobile Routers (MR). Nodes behind the MR primarily comprise
   fixed nodes (nodes unable to change their point of attachment while
   maintaining ongoing sessions), and additionally mobile nodes (nodes
   able to change their point of attachment while maintaining ongoing
   sessions). The internal configuration of the mobile network is
   assumed to be relatively stable with respect to the MR.

   If network mobility is not explicitly supported by some mechanisms
   once a MR changes its point of attachment, existing sessions between
   CNs and nodes behind the MR are broken, and connectivity to the
   global Internet is lost. In addition, fixed nodes behind the MR are
   faced with sub-optimal routing with their correspondents in the
   global Internet, whereas multiple levels of mobility may cause
   extremely sub-optimal routing.

   Traditional work on mobility support as conducted in the Mobile IP
   working group is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to
   mobile hosts only (host mobility support) and are unable to support
   network mobility. The NEMO working group has therefore been created
   to specify solutions specific for network mobility support.

   To describe the problems and to define the requirements that will
   have to be met by the solutions, a new terminology is needed, which
   is the object of the present document. This terminology is supposed
   to serve as the base document produced by the NEMO WG and shall be
   refined once we agree on the requirements.

  2. Applications

   Cases of mobile networks include networks attached to people
   (Personal Area Network or PAN, i.e. a network composed by all
   Internet appliances carried by people, like a PDA, a mobile phone, a
   digital camera, a laptop, etc.) and networks of sensors deployed in
   aircrafts, boats, busses, cars, trains, etc. An airline company that
   provides permanent on-board Internet access is an example of a mobile
   network. This allows passengers to use their laptops (this scenario
   is mentioned in [Tanenbaum] under section 1.2.4 and section 5.5.8;
   [Perkins] under section 5.12; [Solomon] under section 11.2; and
   [RFC2002] section 4.5), PDA, or mobile phone to connect to remote
   hosts, download music or video, browse the web. Passengers could
   themselves carry a network with them (a PAN). At the same time, air
   control traffic could be exchanged between the aircraft and air

   traffic control stations (this scenario has already been investigated
   by Eurocontrol, the European Organization for the safety of air
   navigation. During a transatlantic flight, the aircraft changes its
   point of attachment to the Internet and may be reachable by distinct
   Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Over the oceans, the aircraft gets
   connected to the Internet through a geostationary satellite; over the
   ground, it's through a radio link. Handoffs do typically not occur
   very often (a radio link may cover 400-500 kilometers). Another
   similar scenario mentioning ships and aircrafts can be found in
   [RFC1726, section 5.15]. Similarly, a bus, the metropolitan public
   transport, or the taxi company could allow passengers to connect
   their PAN to the Internet via the embarked network, therefore
   ensuring, while on-board, an alternative to the metropolitan cellular
   network, in terms of price or available bandwidth, access control,
   etc. Meanwhile, a number of Internet appliances deployed in the
   mobile network are used to collect traffic and navigation data from
   the Internet while sensors within the mobile network collect and
   transmit to the Internet live information, like the current number of
   passengers, expected time to arrival, the amount of petrol left in
   the tank, etc. For a number of reasons (network management, security,
   performance,...), it is desirable to interconnect the Internet
   appliances deployed in cars, trains, busses by means of, for
   instance, an Ethernet cable, instead of connecting them individually
   and directly to the Internet, therefore exhibiting the need to
   displace an entire network.

 3. Terminology

   Terms introduced in this draft comply with the terminology already
   defined in the IPv6 [RFC2460] and Mobile IPv6 [MIPv6] specifications.
   Our terminology is primarily targeted toward IPv6 but is not
   necessarily limited to it. Terms defined in [Mobility] may also be
   useful.

   Some terms introduced in the present draft will only be useful for
   the purpose of defining the problem scope and functional requirements
   of network mobility support and shall be removed or refined once we
   agree on the requirements. Terms redundant with the terminology
   defined in [Mobility] shall also be removed.

   The first section introduces terms to define the architecture
   components; the second introduces terms to discuss the requirements,
   the third, terms to discuss nested mobility; the forth defines
   multihoming, and the last, miscellaneous terms which do not fit in
   either sections.

   The terminology is summarized in fig.1 to 5. Fig.1 shows a single
   mobile subnetwork. Fig.2. shows a larger mobile network comprising

   several subnetworks, attached on a foreign link. Fig.3 illustrates a
   node changing its point of attachment within the mobile network.
   Fig.4 and 5 illustrate nested mobility.

  3.1. Architecture Components

   Mobile Network

      An entire network, moving as a unit, which dynamically changes its
      point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in
      the topology. The mobile network is connected to the global
      Internet via one or more mobile router(s) (MRs). From the fixed
      Internet, the mobile network is a cloud. The internal
      configuration of the mobile network is assumed to be relatively
      stable with respect to the MR and is not a matter of concern. The
      internal of the mobile network will therefore not affect network
      mobility support protocols.

                        Fig.1: Architecture Components

   Mobile Network Node (MNN)

      Any host or router located within the mobile network, either

      permanently or temporarily. A MNN could be any of a MR, LFN, VMN,
      or LMN. The distinction between LFN, LMN and VMN is necessary to
      discuss issues related to mobility management and access control,
      but does not preclude that mobility should be handled differently.
      Nodes are classified according to their function and capabilities.

   Mobile Router (MR)

      A router which changes its point of attachment to the Internet.
      The MR has one or more egress interface(s) and one or more ingress
      interface(s) and acts as a gateway between the mobile network and
      the rest of the Internet. The MR thus maintains the Internet
      connectivity for the entire mobile network. When forwarding a
      packet to the Internet (i.e. upstream), the packet transmitted
      through one MR's egress interface; when forwarding a packet to the
      mobile network (i.e. downstream), the packet is transmitted
      through one of the MR's ingress interface.

   Fixed Node (FN)

      A node, either a host or a router, unable to change its point of
      attachment and its IP address without breaking open sessions. FNs
      are standard IPv6 nodes as defined in [IPv6-NODE] which do not
      support the MN functionality defined in [MIPv6] section 8.5 nor
      any other form of mobility support (also see [IPv6-NODE] section 7
      "Mobility").

   Mobile Node (MN)

      A node, either a host or a router, which is able to change its
      point of attachment and maintain continuous sessions.

   Node behind the MR

      Any MNN in a mobile network, beside the MRs connecting the mobile
      network to the Internet.

   Correspondent Node (CN)

      Any node that is communicating with one or more MNNs. A CN could
      itself be located within the mobile network.

   Access Router (AR)

      Any subsequent point of attachment of the MR at the network layer.
      Basically, a router on the home link or the foreign link. An AR
      may itself be located in a mobile network and provide access to
      mobile nodes.

   Egress Interface of a MR

      The interface attached to the home link if the MR is at home, or
      attached to a foreign link if the MR is in a foreign network.

   Ingress Interface of a MR

      The interface attached to a link inside the mobile network. This
      interface is configured with the Mobile Network Prefix.

   Home subnet prefix

      A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an IP
      address which identifies the MR's home link within the Internet
      topology (i.e. the IP subnet prefix corresponding to the mobile
      node's home address, as defined in [MIPv6]).

   Foreign subnet prefix

      A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an IP
      address which identifies the MR's foreign link within the Internet
      topology.

   Mobile Network Prefix

      A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an IP
      address which identifies the entire mobile network within the
      Internet topology. All MNNs necessarily have an address named
      after this prefix.

  3.2. Functional Terms

   The distinction of MNNs between LFN, LMN, and VMN as defined below is
   a property of how different types of nodes can move in the topology.
   The rationale here is that nodes with different properties (may) have
   different requirements. This distinction may not be useful once we
   agree on the requirements. They are listed here as a means to ease
   and clarify the requirement discussion.

   Local Fixed Node (LFN)

      A fixed node (FN) that belongs to the mobile network and which
      doesn't move topologically with respect to the MR.

   Local Mobile Node (LMN)

      A mobile node (MN) or a mobile router (MR) that belongs to the
      mobile network (i.e. its home link is within the mobile network).
      It can move topologically with respect to the MR.

   Visiting Mobile Node (VMN)

      A mobile node (MN) or a mobile router (MR) that doesn't belong to
      the mobile network (i.e. its home link is not within the mobile
      network). A VMN that gets attached to a link within the mobile
      network obtains an address on that link and can move topologically
      with respect to the MR.

   NEMO-enabled (NEMO-node)

      A node that has been extended with network mobility support
      capabilities and that may take special actions based on that.
      (details of the capabilities are not known yet, but it may be
      implementing some sort of Route Optimization).

   MIPv6-enabled (MIPv6-node)

      A mobile node (MN) which is able to change its point of attachment
      and maintains continuous sessions thanks to the MN functionality
      as defined in [MIPv6] section 8.5.

  3.3. Nested Mobility

   Nested mobility occurs when there are more than one level of
   mobility. A MNN acts as an Access Router and allows visiting nodes to
   get attached to it. There are two cases of nested mobility:

      - when the attaching node is a single node: VMN (see figure 4).
      For instance, when a passenger carrying a mobile phone gets
      Internet access from the public access network deployed into a
      bus.

      - when the attaching node is a router with nodes behind it, i.e. a
      mobile network (see figure 5). For instance, when a passenger
      carrying a PAN gets Internet access from the public access network

   For the second case, we introduce the following terms:

   Nested Mobile Network

      A mobile network is said to be nested when a mobile network is
      getting attached to a larger mobile network. The aggregated
      hierarchy of mobile networks becomes a single nested mobile
      network.

   root-NEMO

      The mobile network at the top of the hierarchy connecting the
      aggregated nested mobile network to the Internet.

   parent-NEMO

      The upstream mobile network providing Internet access to a mobile
      network down the hierarchy.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Network Mobility Support Terminology     November 2002


   sub-NEMO

      The downstream mobile network attached to a mobile network up the
      hierarchy. It becomes a subservient of the parent-NEMO. The sub-
      NEMO is getting Internet access through the parent-NEMO and does
      not provide Internet access to the parent-NEMO.

   root-MR (was TLMR: Top-Level Mobile Router)

      The MR(s) of the root-NEMO used to connect the nested mobile
      network to the fixed Internet.

   parent-MR

      The MR(s) of the parent-NEMO.

   sub-MR

      The MR(s) of the sub-NEMO connected to a parent-NEMO

  3.4. Multihoming


   Multihomed Host

      Multihoming, as currently defined by the IETF, covers site-
      multihoming [MULTI6] and host multihoming. Within host-
      multihoming, a host may be either:

         - multi-addressed: multiple source addresses to choose between
         on a given interface; all IPv6 nodes are multi-addressed due to
         the presence of link-local addresses on all interfaces.

         - multi-interfaced: multiple interfaces according to [RFC2460]
         definition.

         - multi-linked: just like multi-interfaced but all interfaces
         are NOT connected to the same link.

         - multi-sited: when using IPv6 site-local address and attached
         to different sites

   Multihomed Mobile Network

      From 3.4.1, a mobile network is multihomed when either:

         - a MR has multiple egress interfaces on the same link, or

         - a MR has multiple egress interfaces on distinct link, or

         - there are more than one MR in the mobile network


   Multihomed Nested Mobile Network

      From 3.4.1, a nested mobile network is multihomed when either:

         - a root-MR has multiple egress interfaces on the same link, or

         - a root-MR has multiple egress interfaces on distinct link. or

         - there are more than one root-MR in the mobile network

   Illustration

      Fig.6 and 7 show two examples of multihomed mobile networks.
      Fig.8. shows two independent mobile networks. mobile_network_1 is
      single-homed to the Internet through MR1. mobile_network_2 is
      multihomed to the Internet through MR2a and MR2b.

      Let's consider the two following nested scenarios:

         Scenario 1: what happens when MR2a. attaches to AR1 ?

            - mobile_network_2 becomes a subservient of mobile_network_1

            - mobile_network_1 is the parent-NEMO (and also the root-
            NEMO)

            - mobile_network_2 is the sub-NEMO

            - MR1 is the root-MR for the aggregated nested mobile
            network

            - MR2a is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

            - mobile_network_2 is still multihomed to the Internet, but
            to AR1 and ARz

            - the aggregated nested mobile network is not multihomed


         Scenario 2: what happens when MR1 attaches to AR2 ?

            - mobile_network_1 becomes a subservient of mobile_network_2

            - mobile_network_1 is the sub-NEMO

            - mobile_network_2 is the parent_NEMO (and also the root-
            NEMO)

            - MR2a and MR2b are both root_MRs for the aggregated nested
            mobile network

            - MR1 is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

            - mobile_network_1 is not multihomed

            - the aggregated nested mobile network is multihomed

  3.5. Miscellaneous Terms

   Host mobility support

      Host Mobility Support allows mobile nodes to maintain session
      continuity. In IPv6, it is achieved by Mobile IPv6

   Network Mobility support (NEMO Support)

      Network mobility support allows mobile networks to maintain
      session continuity. Solutions developed to support NEtwork
      MObility will be referred to as "NEMO support".

      In Basic support, each Mobile Router has a Home Agent, and uses
      bidirectional tunneling between the MR and HA to preserve session
      continuity while the MR moves. The MR will acquire a Care-of-
      address from its attachment point much like what is done for
      Mobile Nodes using Mobile IP. This approach allows nesting of
      mobile networks, since each MR will appear to its attachment point
      as a single node.

      In Extended support, we will seek to optimize routing between MNNs
      and arbitrary CNs by some means which details are not known yet.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Network Mobility Support Terminology     November 2002


   intra-domain mobility

      Mobility within a single administrative domain, i.e. between
      subnetworks topologically close in the IP hierarchy. As an
      instance, the displacement of a node within a limited vicinity of
      adjacent subnetworks, like in a campus, that belong to the same
      organization or between ARs that belong to the same ISP. In the
      literature, and depending on the definition of ``closeness'', this
      is also termed intra-site mobility, local mobility or micro-
      mobility.

   inter-domain mobility

      Mobility across administrative domain boundaries, i.e. between
      subnetworks topologically distant in the IP hierarchy. As an
      instance of Wide-Area Mobility, displacement of a node between
      distinct ISPs or organizations, or between widely separated sites
      of a single organization. In the literature, and depending on the
      definition of ``remoteness'', this is also termed inter-site
      mobility, global mobility, or macro-mobility.

   Idle MNN

      A MNN that does not engage in any communication.

   Idle Mobile Network

      A mobile network that does not engage in any communication outside
      the network may be considered idle from the global Internet. This
      doesn't preclude that MNNs are themselves idle. Internal traffic
      between any two MNNs located in the same mobile network is not
      concerned by this statement.


  4. Changes since last draft

   - replace TLMR with root-MR

   - add sub-MR, and parent-MR

   - add a definition for "Multihomed Nested Mobile Network"
