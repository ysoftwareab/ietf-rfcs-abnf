<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems where congestion
	prevents full utilization of the path between sender and receiver at today's
	"broadband" speeds. ISPs desire to control the congestion, which often appears
	to be caused by a small number of users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.
	Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle this congestion can
	be expensive; and network operators have sought other ways to manage congestion.
	The current mechanisms all suffer from difficulty measuring the congestion (as
	distinguished from the total traffic). 
</p>
<p> The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestion along any
	path visible at the Internet Layer. This document discusses this mechanism.

Introduction</h3>

<p> The growth of "always on" broadband connections, coupled with the steady
	increase in access speeds <a class='info' href='#OfCom'>[OfCom]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ofcom: Office of Communications, &ldquo;UK Broadband Speeds 2008: Research report,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, has meant network operators are increasingly
	facing problems with congestion. But congestion results from sharing network
	capacity with others, not merely from using it. In general, today's "DSL"
	and cable-internet users cannot "cause" congestion in the absence of
	competing traffic. (Wireless ISPs and cellular internet have different
	tradeoffs which we will not discuss here.) 
</p>
<p> Actual congestion generally results from the interaction of traffic from
	an ISPs own subscribers with traffic from other users. The tools currently
	available don't allow an operator to identify the causes of the congestion
	and so leave them powerless to properly control it. 
</p>
<p> While building out more capacity to handle increased traffic is always
	good, the expense and lead-time can be prohibitive, especially for network
	operators that charge flat-rate feeds to subscribers and are thus unable
	to charge heavier users more for causing more congestion <a class='info' href='#BB-incentive'>[BB&#8209;incentive]<span> (</span><span class='info'>MIT Communications Futures Program (CFP) and Cambridge University Communications Research Network, &ldquo;The Broadband Incentive Problem,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. For an operator
	facing congestion caused by other operators' networks, building out its
	own capacity is unlikely to solve the congestion problem. Operators are
	thus facing increased pressure to find effective solutions to dealing
	with high-consuming users. 
</p>
<p> The growth of "scavenger-class" services helps to reduce congestion,
	but actually make the ISPs problem less tractable. These are services
	where participating users are not at all interested in paying more, but
	wish to make good use of the capacity of the path. Thus, users of such
	services may show very heavy total traffic up until the moment congestion
	is detected (at the Transport Layer), but immediately back off. ISP
	monitoring (at the Internet Layer) cannot detect this congestion avoidance
	if the congestion in question is in a different domain further along the
	path; and must treat such users as congestion-causing users. 
</p>
<p>We propose that Internet Protocol (IP) packets have two "congestion"
	fields. The exact protocol details of these fields are for another
	document, but we expect them to provide measures of "congestion so far"
	and "congestion still expected".

Definitions</h3>

<p> Since ConEx expects to build on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, we use the term "congestion" in a manner
	consistent with ECN, namely that congestion occurs before any packet is
	dropped. 
</p>
<p> We define six specific terms carefully:

	</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Congestion:</dt>
<dd> Congestion is a measure of the probability that a
	    given packet will be ECN-marked or dropped as it traverses the network.
	    At any given router it is a function of the queue state at that router.
	    Congestion is added in a combinatorial manner, that is, routers ignore
	    the congestion a packet has already seen when they decide whether to
	    mark it or not. 
</dd>
<dt>Congestion Volume:</dt>
<dd>  Congestion volume is defined 
		as the congestion a packet experiences, multiplied by the size of that packet.
		See <a class='info' href='#Fairer-faster'>[Fairer&#8209;faster]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;A Fairer Faster Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</dd>
<dt>Upstream Congestion:</dt>
<dd> The congestion that has already been
	    experienced by a packet as it travels along its path. In other words at 
		any point on the path, it is the congestion between the source of the
	    packet and that point. 
</dd>
<dt>Downstream Congestion:</dt>
<dd> The congestion that a packet still
	    has to experience on the remainder of its path. In other words at any
	    point it is the congestion still to be experienced as the packet
	    travels between that point and its destination.
</dd>
<dt>Ingress Router:</dt>
<dd> The Ingress Router is the first router a
	    packet traverses that is outside its own network. In a domestic network
	    that will be the first router downstream from the home access equipment.
	    In a commercial network it may be the first router downstream of the
	    firewall. 
</dd>
<dt>Egress Router:</dt>
<dd> The Egress Router is the last router a packet
	    traverses before it enters the destination network. 
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Existing Approaches to Congestion Management</h3>

<p>Initial attempts to capture congestion situations have usually focused on
	the peak hours and aimed at rate limiting heavy users during that time. For
	example, users who have consumed a certain amount of bandwidth during the
	last 24 hours got elected as those who get their traffic shaped if the
	total amount of traffic reaches a congestion situation in certain nodes
	within the operator's network. 
</p>
<p>All of the current approaches suffer from some general limitations. First,
	they introduce performance uncertainty. Flat-rate pricing plans are popular
	because users appreciate the certainty of having their monthly bill amount
	remain the same for each billing period, allowing them to plan their costs
	accordingly. But while flat-rate pricing avoids billing uncertainty, it
	creates performance uncertainty: users cannot know whether the performance
	of their connection is being altered or degraded based on how the network
	operator manages congestion. 
</p>
<p>Second, none of the approaches is able to make use of what may be the most
	important factor in managing congestion: the amount that a given endpoint
	contributes to congestion on the network. This information simply is not
	available to network nodes, and neither volume nor rate nor application
	usage is an adequate proxy for congestion volume, because none of these
	metrics measures a user or network's actual contribution to congestion on
	the network. 
</p>
<p> Finally, none of these solutions accounts for inter-network congestion.
	Mechanisms may exist that allow an operator to identify and mitigate
	congestion in their own network, but the design of the Internet means that
	only the end-hosts have full visibility of congestion information along the
	whole path. ConEx allows this information to be visible to everyone on the
	path and thus allows operators to make better-informed decisions about
	controlling traffic. 
</p>
<a name="anchor4"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Exposing Congestion</h3>

<p> We argue that current traffic-control mechanisms seek to control the
	wrong quantity. What matters in the network is neither the volume of
	traffic nor the rate of traffic: it is the contribution to congestion over
	time&nbsp;&mdash; congestion means that your traffic impacts other users,
	and conversely that their traffic impacts you. So if there is no congestion
	there need not be any restriction on the amount a user can send;
	restrictions only need to apply when others are sending traffic such that
	there is congestion. 
</p>
<p> For example, an application intending to transfer large amounts of data
	could use a congestion control mechanism like <a class='info' href='#LEDBAT'>[LEDBAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., &ldquo;Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>
	to reduce its transmission rate before any competing TCP flows do, by
	detecting an increase in end-to-end delay (as a measure of impending
	congestion). However such techniques rely on voluntary, altruistic action
	by end users and their application providers. ISPs can neither enforce
	their use nor avoid penalizing them for congestion they avoid. 
</p>
<p> The Internet was designed so that end-hosts detect and control congestion.
	We argue that congestion needs to be visible to network nodes as well, not
	just to the end hosts. More specifically, a network needs to be able to
	measure how much congestion any particular traffic expects to cause between
	the monitoring point in the network and the destination ("rest-of-path
	congestion"). This would be a new capability. Today a network can use
	Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> to
	detect how much congestion the traffic has suffered between the source and
	a monitoring point, but not beyond. This new capability would enable an
	ISP to give incentives for the use of LEDBAT-like applications whilst
	restricting inappropriate uses of traditional TCP and UDP ones. 
</p>
<p> So we propose a new approach which we call Congestion Exposure. We

	propose that congestion information should be made visible at the IP

	layer, so that any network node can measure the contribution to congestion

<p> In general, congestion exposure gives ISPs a principled way to hold their

	it. The probability of a packet being marked increases with the length of
	the queue and thus the rate of CE marks is a guide to the level of congestion
	at that queue. This CE codepoint travels forward through the network to the
	receiver which then informs the sender that it has seen congestion. The

	receiver cannot make a sender install an adaptive codec, or install LEDBAT
	instead of TCP congestion-control. And a receiver cannot cause an attacker to

<p> What is needed is knowledge of the downstream congestion level, for which

A Possible Congestion Exposure Mechanism</h3>

<p> One possible protocol is based on a concept known as re-feedback

Koyabe, &ldquo;Policing Congestion Response in an Internetwork Using Re-Feedback,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, and builds on existing active queue
	management techniques like RED <a class='info' href='#RFC2309'>[RFC2309]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Clark, D., Crowcroft, J., Davie, B., Deering, S., Estrin, D., Floyd, S., Jacobson, V., Minshall, G., Partridge, C., Peterson, L., Ramakrishnan, K., Shenker, S., Wroclawski, J., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and ECN
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> that network elements can already use to
	measure and expose congestion. The protocol is described in more detail in
	<a class='info' href='#Fairer-faster'>[Fairer&#8209;faster]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;A Fairer Faster Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, but we summarise it below.
</p>
<p> In this protocol packets have two Congestion fields in their IP header:


	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> A congestion experienced field to record the Upstream Congestion level
	  along the path. Routers indicate their current congestion level by
	  updating this field in every packet. As the packet traverses the network
	  it builds up a record of the overall congestion along its path in this
	  field. This data is sent back to the sender who uses it to determine its
	  transmission rate. 
</li>
<li> A whole-path congestion field that uses re-feedback to record the total
	  congestion expected along the path. The sender does this by re-inserting
	  the current Congestion level for the path into this field for every packet
	  it transmits. 
</li>
</ul><p>


	Thus at any node downstream of the sender you can see the Upstream
	Congestion for the packet and the whole path congestion (with a time lag of 
	one round-trip-time (RTT)) and can calculate the Downstream Congestion by 
	subtracting one from the other. 
</p>
<p> So congestion exposure can be achieved by coupling congestion notification
	from routers with the re-insertion of this information by the sender. This
	establishes information symmetry between users and network providers.

ConEx Use Cases</h3>

<p> ConEx is a simple concept that has revolutionary implications. It is that rare
	thing&nbsp;&mdash; a truly disruptive technology, and as such it is hard to
	imagine the variety of uses it may be put to. However there are several obvious
	use cases that come to mind with a little thought. The authors aren't claiming
	all of these have equal merit, nor are we claiming ConEx is the only conceivable
	solution to achieve these. But these use cases represent a consensus among
	people that have been working on this approach for some years. 
</p>
<p> In the following use cases we are assuming the most abstract version of the
	ConEx mechanism, namely that every packet carries two congestion fields, one for
	upstream congestion and one for downstream. At every node that is congested the
	upstream congestion value will be incremented in some manner and the downstream
	congestion value will be decremented. Assuming there is accurate feedback in the
	system then the aim should be for the downstream value to be zero or slightly
	positive by the time the packet reaches its destination. 
</p>
<p> If ConEx information is to be useful it has to be accurate (within the
	limitations of the available feedback). This raises three issues that need to be
	addressed:

	</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Distinguishing ConEx traffic from non-ConEx traffic:</dt>
<dd>
	    An ISP may reasonably choose to do nothing different with ConEx traffic. 
		Alternatively they might want to incentivise it in order to give it marginally better
	    service. IN that case it will be necessary to distinguish ConEx traffic from non-ConEx traffic.
		On one level this seems pretty easy&nbsp;&mdash; ConEx traffic will have
	    the downstream congestion field in every packet. However in practise it may not
	    be as simple as this as the protocol may use a unary encoding (where the congestion value 
		is encoded across several packets).  
</dd>
<dt>Over-declaring congestion:</dt>
<dd> 
	    ConEx relies on the sender accurately declaring the congestion they expect to
	    see. During TCP slow-start a sender is unable to predict the level of congestion
	    they will experience and it is advisable to declare that expect to see some
	    congestion on the first packet. However, if any host or router marks more than
	    a small fraction of total traffic, downstream routers are less likely to trust
	    its congestion markings. We do not initially propose any mechanism to deal with
	    this issue. 
</dd>
<dt>Under-declaring congestion:</dt>
<dd> 
	    ConEx requires the sender to set the downstream congestion field in each packet 
	    to their best estimate of what they expect the whole path congestion to be. If
	    this expected congestion level is to be used for traffic management (see use
	    cases) then it benefits the user to under-declare. Mechanisms are needed to
	    prevent this happening. 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> There are three approaches that may work (individually or in combination):
	    
<ul class="text">
<li> An ingress router can monitor a user's feedback to see what their reported
		congestion level actually is. 
</li>
<li> A ConEx-aware router can drop any packet with a downstream-congestion value
		of zero or less if that router is even slightly congested. 
</li>
<li> An egress router can actively monitor some or all flows to check that they
		are complying with the requirement that the downstream congestion value should
		be zero or (slightly positive) when it reaches the egress. 
</li>
</ul>
	  
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p> At any point of congestion, it is reasonable to treat ConEx-marked traffic
	differently:
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> non-ConEx traffic will mostly be dropped (as now); 
</li>
<li> ConEx-marked traffic which has exhausted its congestion allowance will (all)
	      be dropped; 
</li>
</ul><p>

<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h3>7.1.&nbsp;
Ingress policing for traffic management</h3>

<p> Currently many ISPs impose some form of traffic management at peak hours. This
	  is a simple economic necessity&nbsp;&mdash; the only reason the Internet works
	  as a commercial concern is that ISPs are able to rely on statistical multiplexing
	  to share their expensive core network between large numbers of customers. In order
	  to ensure all customers get some chance to access the network, the "heaviest"
	  customers will be subjected to some form of traffic management at peak times
	  (typically a rate cap for certain types of traffic) <a class='info' href='#Fair-use'>[Fair&#8209;use]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Broadband Choices, &ldquo;Truth about 'fair usage' broadband,&rdquo; 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Often this traffic
	  management is done with expensive flow aware devices such as DPI boxes or flow-aware
	  routers. 
</p>
<p> ConEx enables a new approach that requires simple per-user policing at the ingress.
	  As described above, every packet a user sends should declare the total congestion
	  that the sender expects that packet to encounter on its journey through the network.
	  This allows the overall Congestion Volume to be calculated.  In effect this is a measure of how much
	  traffic was sent that was above the instantaneous transmission capacity of the
	  network. By extension the congestion rate would be the transmission rate multiplied
	  by the congestion level. A 1 Gbps router that is 0.1% congested implies that there is
	  1 Mbps of excess traffic at that point in time. 
</p>
<p> At the Ingress Router an ISP can police the amount of congestion a user is causing
	  by limiting the congestion volume they send into the network. One system that
	  achieves this is described in <a class='info' href='#Policing-freedom'>[Policing&#8209;freedom]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., Jacquet, A., and T. Moncaster, &ldquo;Policing Freedom to Use the Internet Resource Pool,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	  This uses a modified token bucket to limit the congestion rate being sent rather
	  than the overall rate. Effectively the Ingress Router is now acting as a ConEx policer.
	  Such ingress policing is relatively simple as it requires no
	  flow state. Furthermore, unlike many mechanisms, it treats all a user's packets
	  equally.

ConEx to incentivise scavenger transports</h3>

<p> Recent work proposes a new approach for QoS where traffic is provided with a less
	  than best effort or "scavenger" quality of service. The idea is that low priority
	  but high volume traffic such as OS updates, P2P file transfers and view-later TV
	  programs should be allowed to use any spare network capacity, but should rapidly
	  get out of the way if a higher priority or interactive application starts up.
	  One solution being actively explored is LEDBAT which proposes a new congestion
	  control algorithm that is less aggressive in seeking out bandwidth than TCP. 
</p>
<p> At present most ISPs assume a strong correlation between the volume of a flow
	  and the impact that flow causes in the network. This assumption has been eroded
	  by the growth of interactive streaming which behaves in an inelastic manner.
	  Assuming the end-user is using ConEx marking on all traffic and that LEDBAT
	  leads to the expected low level of congestion and the ingress ISP has deployed
	  a ConEx-aware ingress policer, then the LEDBAT will not be penalised since it
	  will be causing less congestion. (If LEDBAT is not ConEx-marking traffic then
	  the ISP will be forced to guess the congestion, probably based on the total
	  volume). 
</p>
<p> If the ISP has deployed a ConEx-aware ingress policer then they are able to
	  incentivise the use of LEDBAT because a user will be policed according to the
	  overall congestion volume their traffic generates. If all background file
	  transfers are only generating a low level of congestion then the sender has
	  more "congestion budget" to "spend" on their interactive applications. It can
	  be shown <a class='info' href='#Kelly'>[Kelly]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kelly, F., Maulloo, A., and D. Tan, &ldquo;Rate control for communication networks: shadow prices, proportional fairness and stability,&rdquo; 1998.</span><span>)</span></a> that this approach maximises social welfare&nbsp;&mdash; in
	  other words if you limit the congestion that all users can generate then
 	  everyone benefits from a better service.

ConEx to mitigate DDoS</h3>

<p> DDoS relies on subverting innocent end users and getting them to send flood

	  then it can't be called Denial of Service. If the ingress ISP has deployed ConEx
	  aware policers <a class='info' href='#conex-uses-policing'>Section&nbsp;7.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ingress policing for traffic management</span><span>)</span></a>, that ISP will limit how much DDoS traffic enters the 'net. If the
	  compromised user tries to use the 'net during the DDoS attack, they will quickly 
	  become aware that something is wrong, and their ISP can show the evidence that
	  their computer has become zombified.

ConEx as a form of differential QoS</h3>

<p> Most QoS approaches require the active participation of routers to control the

	  it is clear that low delay and low jitter are critical and thus these probably
	  always need different treatment at a router. However if low loss is the issue
	  then ConEx offers an alternative approach. Assuming the ingress ISP has deployed
	  ConEx-aware ingress policing then the only control on a user's traffic is
	  dependent on the congestion that user has caused. If they want to prioritise some
	  traffic over other traffic then they can allow that traffic to generate more
	  congestion. The price to pay will be to reduce the congestion that their other
	  traffic causes.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p> This document proposes a mechanism tagging onto Explicit Congestion Notification
        <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, and inherits the security issues listed therein. The
        additional issues from Congestion Expected markings relate to the degree of trust
        each forwarding point places in Congestion Expected markings it receives, which is
        a business decision mostly orthogonal to the markings themselves. 
</p>
<p> One expected use of exposed congestion information is to hold the end-to-end
	transport and the network accountable to each other. The network cannot be relied
	on to report information to the receiver against its interest, and the same applies
	for the information the receiver feeds back to the sender, and that the sender
	reports back to the network. Looking at each in turn:


	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> The Network. In general it is not in any network's interest to under-declare
	  congestion since this will have potentially negative consequences for all users
	  of that network. It may be in its interest to over-declare congestion if, for
	  instance, it wishes to force traffic to move away to a different network or
	  simply to reduce the amount of traffic it is carrying. Congestion Exposure
	  itself won't significantly alter the incentives for and against honest
	  declaration of congestion by a network, but we can imagine applications of
	  Congestion Exposure that will change these incentives. There is a perception
	  among network operators that their level of congestion is a business secret.
	  Today, congestion is one of the worst-kept secrets a network has, because
	  end-hosts can see congestion better than network operators can. Congestion
	  Exposure will enable network operators to pinpoint whether congestion is on
	  one side or the other of any border. It is conceivable that forwarders with
	  underprovisioned networks may try to obstruct deployment of Congestion
	  Exposure. 
</li>
<li> The Receiver. Receivers generally have an incentive to under-declare
	  congestion since they generally wish to receive the data from the sender as
	  rapidly as possible. <a class='info' href='#Savage'>[Savage]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Savage, S., Wetherall, D., and T. Anderson, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a> explains how a receiver can
	  significantly improve their throughput my failing to declare congestion. This
	  is a problem with or without Congestion Exposure. <a class='info' href='#KGao'>[KGao]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gao, K. and C. Wang, &ldquo;Incrementally Deployable Prevention to TCP Attack with Misbehaving Receivers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>
	  explains one possible technique to encourage receiver's to be honest in their
	  declaration of congestion.
</li>
<li> The Sender. One proposed mechanism for Congestion Exposure deployment adds
	  a requirement for a sender to advise the network how much congestion it has
	  suffered or caused. Although most senders currently respond to congestion
	  they are informed of, one use of exposed congestion information might be to
	  encourage sources of excessive congestion to back off more aggressively.
	  Then clearly there may be an incentive for the sender to under-declare
	  congestion. This will be a particular problem with sources of flooding
	  attacks. "Policing" mechanisms have been proposed to deal with this. 
</li>
</ul><p>

	

	In addition there are potential problems from source spoofing. A malicious
	sender can pretend to be another user by spoofing the source address.
	Congestion Exposure allows for "Policers" and "Traffic Shapers" so as to be
	robust against injection of false congestion information into the forward
	path.
