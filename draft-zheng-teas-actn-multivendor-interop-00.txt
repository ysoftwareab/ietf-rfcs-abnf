Abstract 
 
   ACTN is a practical approach to repurpose existing and well-defined 
   technologies, and underpinning them with SDN principle. It provides 
   a hierarchal architecture to scale and support multi-vendor multi-
   domain interworking using RESTconf(YANG Model)/PCEP/BGP-LS. 

   This document contains a test case proposal focused multi-domain, 
   multi-vendor interoperation test cases for the ACTN framework. These 
   test cases cover four test scenarios, including topology 
   abstraction, E2E service provisioning, DC load balancing and inter-
   domain restoration, to demonstrate the fundamental ideas of the ACTN 
   framework and standards.

1. Introduction 

   The ACTN interoperation test cases are designed to demonstrate the 
   on-going work in IETF of the ACTN framework, including: 

   - ACTN basic solutions for SDN architecture to support multi-domain, 
      multi-vendor supporting. 

   - ACTN important interfaces are focused on IETF standards for multi-
      protocol supporting.   

   This document is focused on the demonstration of interoperation test 
   case procedures to show how ACTN architecture can be implemented. 
   The ACTN hierarchical controllers include Customer Network 
   Controller (CNC), the Multi-domain Service Coordinator (MDSC), and 
   Physical Network Controller (PNC). In this interoperation test, we 
   focus on the MDSC, PNC, and the MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) between 
   them. The ACTN MPI can support both RESTCONF/YANG and PCEP-LS and 
   gives a deployment choice that meets the need of the operators.

3. Related work: Architecture, Modeling and Protocols 

   ACTN provides description about future requirements in SDN 
   literature in [ACTN-Requirements]. ACTN framework has been proposed 
   in [ACTN-Frame] to support all the requirements. The information 
   model has been defined in [ACTN-Info]. 

   From the solution perspective, ACTN work has been associated with 
   some other IETF works in various working group including netmod, 
   i2rs, rtgwg, ccamp, pce and so on. Yang models, defined in Netconf 
   [RFC6241]/Restconf [Restconf], have been considered as an approach 
   for network configuration. [ACTN-YANG] has described the 
   applicability of YANG models in the ACTN framework, where various 
   yang models including TE topology model from [TE-Topology], tunnel 
   model from [TE-Tunnel] and service model from [Transport-Service-
   Model] and [ACTN-VN-YANG] have been applied on the ACTN interfaces 
   to complete different functions. PCE protocol in the pce working 
   group has also been considered to be extended and applied for the 
   ACTN interfaces. The applicability draft can be found in [ACTN-PCE]. 
   PCEP extensions with Link State features can be found in [PCEP-LS] 
   for topology discovery, and PCE Initation mechanism defined in [PCE-
   Init] can be used to set up the connections.   

4. Test-cases 

   This section provides a number of test cases. Currently the test is 
   basically conducted between the MDSC and PNC, i.e., on the MPI 
   interface in the ACTN architecture. The scenario we are going to 
   test includes the topology abstraction, E2E service provisioning, DC 
   load balancing and Inter-domain recovery.  

   Some fundamental environment has been set up and applied to all the 
   test cases. On the network element level, emulators from various 
   vendors have been connected with their corresponding PNC. The 
   interface between PNC and network elements is known as the 
   southbound interface (SBI) in SDN literature. The protocol on SBI 
   can be vendor-specific.  

   The MDSC can be either from network operators or vendors, to 
   coordinate among multiple PNCs. The interaction between the MDSC and 
   the PNCs, which is known as MPI in ACTN and considered as a part of 
   northbound interface in SDN literature, should be standard.  

4.1. Topology Abstraction 

   This scenario is used to verify the multi-domain topology collection 
   on the MDSC level. Multi-technology network (IP, MPLS, Transport)

   should report their topology and the MDSC should be capable of 
   integrating different topologies together.  

   MDSC, PNC and network elements are involved in this scenario. The 
   PNC needs to collect the information from the network elements and 
   maintain its own TE Database. Given the physical topology, the PNC 
   may simplify the topology and report an 'abstract' version to the 
   MDSC. The interaction on MPI to exchange the topology information 
   may be via RESTconf with topology YANG model. The example of 
   topology abstraction is shown in Fig. 1, PNC collect the information 
   of 6 network elements in every single domain, and abstract the 
   topology into a 4-point format. Then the abstracted topology can be 
   reported to MDSC. In this example, MDSC will receive the information 
   from two PNC domains, and manipulate on an 8-point abstracted 
   topology.

   Dynamical changes in topology should also be considered. For example 
   when there is a new node discovered in the network, the incremental 
   topology should be correctly detected on PNC, and the abstraction 
   may need to be adjusted accordingly and reported to MDSC for update.  

4.2. E2E Service Provisioning 

   This test case is used to verify the Restconf/YANG functionality on 
   service provisioning via interaction between MDSC and PNC. Inter-
   domain connection, shown in Fig. 2, is expected to be established. 
   In Fig. 2 the topology on the MDSC is shown, and the network element 
   information is hidden.

                 Fig. 2: E2E Service Provisioning Scenario 

   We assume there is request of 100GE service from A1 to C2, following 
   steps need to be completed to set up the connection.  

   Step 1: MDSC compute an inter-domain path and translate the multi-
   domain request into multiple single domain requests of domain A, B 
   and C. 
   Step 2: MDSC sends decomposed requests to each PNC, and each PNC 
   compute intra-domain path: 
      a) Send request to PNC of domain A to set up a service from A1 to 
        A2. 
      b) Send request to PNC of domain B to set up a service from B1 to 
        B2. 
      c) Send request to PNC of domain C to set up a service from C1 to 
        C2. 
      d) These requests may be sent in parallel. 
   Step 3: Each PNC responds successfully creation, or failure with 
   error message. 
   Step 4: MDSC receives responds from all the PNCs, and successfully 
   set up a multi-domain service. 
   The communication between MDSC and PNC could be completed by 
   Restconf protocol associated with tunnel YANG model or service YANG 
   model. The communication between PNC and network elements can be 
   vendor-specific in this scenario.

4.3. DC Load Balancing   

   DC Load balancing is more advanced scenario based on active LSP set 
   up in the network. In this scenario, the result of previous 2 
   scenarios needs to be reused. We assumed there are two disjoint 
   LSPs, one from A1 to C2, and another from A1 to C4. Explicit route 
   can be found as following:  

   LSP1: A1-A2-B1-B2-C1-C2; 

   LSP2: A1-A3-A4-B3-B4-C3-C4; 

   The bandwidth of LSP1 and LSP2 are set to 300G and 100G respectively 
   before load balancing, with a target on adjusting both of them to 
   200G for load balancing. MDSC need to send update message to PNCs to 
   adjust their bandwidth on corresponding links.  

   The interaction on MPI in this case can be completed by Restconf 
   protocol with topology and service YANG model. The interactions 
   between PNC and network elements are vendor-specific.  

 

4.4. Inter-domain Recovery 

   Another test case about inter-domain recovery is also designed to 
   verify the function of cross-domain restoration. In this case a 
   cross-domain LSP is set up, such as reusing the LSP1 in section 4.3. 
   Then a failure in one domain is emulated in one domain, and the PNC 
   of this domain cannot find sufficient resources within the domain so 
   that it MUST turn to the MDSC for inter-domain restoration. MDSC 
   then need to update the topology and resource usage in every domain 
   to compute a path for re-routing. After MDSC got an answer, it will 
   deliver another E2E service, which is a repeating of section 4.2.  

   The interaction on MPI in this case can be completed by Restconf 
   protocol with topology and service YANG model. The interactions 
   between PNC and network elements are vendor-specific.  

    

 

5. Implementation Details 

   The implementation and inter-op test is on-going. Once the result is 
   available, this section will be updated.

   The progress of future test work will be updated and available at 
   the ACTN wiki page: https://sites.google.com/site/openactn/.  

6. Future work  

   Inter-op test can be done either with emulation environment or 
   physical devices in the lab. Some of the test related work in this 
   draft will be done on emulations via remote labs of various vendors, 
   or during IETF Hackathon activity. This will be a continuing 
   activity with follow-up work in coming IETF meetings. More 
   participants will be welcomed to join this effort to further promote 
   IETF work to expedite SDN deployment.  

    

7. Security Considerations 

      This document is an informational draft. When the models 
   mentioned in this draft are implemented, detailed security 
   consideration will be given in such work.
