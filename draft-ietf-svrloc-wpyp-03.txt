Abstract

   This document presents definitions for the ''wp'' and ''yp'' abstract
   services.  The ''wp'' service is for finding people, while the ''yp''
   service if for finding general things (including people).

1. Introduction

   In "Advertising Services" [1], several abstract services are
   proposed.  As specified in [2], the "wp" and "yp" abstract services
   are documented here.  The "wp" service is intended for finding
   people, while the "yp" service is a superset that is intended for
   finding objects.

2. The "wp" Abstract Service

   The "wp" abstract service is for locating people via a directory.
   Version 0.0 of this service specifies four protocols for accessing
   such services: LDAP, WHOIS++, CCSO/Ph and HTTP.

3. The "yp" Abstract Service

   The "yp" abstract service is for locating resources on the Internet
   and is a superset of the "wp" abstract service.  Version 0.0
   specifies the following protocols for accessing such services in
   addition to those specified for the "wp" abstract service: Z39.50 and
   WHOIS++.

   The contact point for version 0.0 of both of these templates is the
   author.


5. Security Considerations

   Both of these abstract services inherit the security considerations
   of the "service:" URL scheme as specified in [2].  As these services
   are both abstract, they further inherit considerations from the
   protocol used to provide the underlying concrete services as
   discussed below.

5.1 Considerations for the "wp" service

   Since the "wp" abstract service can use any of LDAP, HTTP, WHOIS or
   CCSO/Ph, it inherits the security considerations for each of these
   protocols.  See [3] and [8] for LDAP, [9] and [10] for HTTP, [4] and
   [11] for WHOIS, and [12] for CCSO/Ph.

5.2 Considerations for the "yp" service Since the "yp" abstract service
is a superset of the "wp" service, it inherits all the considerations
from the above section.  In addition, it inherits the security
considerations from [6] for Z39.50.
