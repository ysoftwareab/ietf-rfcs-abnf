Abstract

   This document specifies how to use IKEv2 for Home Agent assignment in
   Mobile IPv6 or NEMO bootstrapping.  It uses anycast addresses and
   should not introduce new security issues.


1.  Introduction

   Home Agent (HA) assignment is an improvement over HA discovery: in
   place of giving a list of possible HA addresses, this procedure gives

   the HA to use in a way controlled by the Mobile Service Provider, for
   (initial) load balancing, fail-over or DoS avoidance.

   IKEv2 [IKEv2] is the tool of choice in bootstrapping scenarios
   because not only it established the needed Security Associations but
   it can allocate home Addresses, authenticate the Mobile Node (MN)
   using EAP [RFC2284], etc [IKEv2-MIPv6].  The only function it did not
   support is the HA assignment.

   This document addresses both Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and NEMO [RFC3963]
   cases, the second likely with another anycast address.

   The goal of the document is to provide HA assignment support using an
   IKEv2 initial message sent to an anycast destination address without
   introduction of new security issues.

   This document could use the standard keywords [BCP14] to indicate
   requirement levels.


2.  The proposal

   In the IKEv2 exchanges, the MN takes the initiator role and the HA
   the responder role.  The MN takes parameters from its configuration,
   followed or not by a discovery phase.  The HA address is a
   recognizable anycast address.  So:
   1.  the MN sends an IKE_SA_INIT request to the HA anycast address
   2.  the anycast receiver forwards the request to the "best" HA
   3.  the HA answers using its own address as the source address and
       includes an "under attack" cookie in its replies
   4.  the MN notes the HA address to use in subsequent messages and
       retries the IKE_SA_INIT request with the cookie to the HA own
       address
   The standard IKEv2 procedure follows...

   The proposal can be used in any environment, including Mobile IPv6
   and NEMO, as soon as a recognizable anycast address is assigned to
   the provided service (cf. IANA (Section 3)).

   The term "recognizable anycast address" means an anycast address
   which is recognizable as an anycast address by the initiator.  This
   includes, but not exclusively, addresses in the subnet anycast
   address format defined by [RFC2526].


3.  IANA Considerations

   Mobile IPv6 defines an IPv6 subnet anycast address [RFC2526] (value

   decimal=126 / hexa=7E).  In the case Mobile IPv6 and NEMO services
   are not provided by the same HAs, a second anycast address has to be
   assigned by IANA for NEMO HAs.


4.  Security Considerations

   As the anycast address can be well known, the cookie-based defense
   against DoS is used by default.  Another advantage is the whole
   IKE_SA_INIT and IKE_AUTH exchanges are performed using the "right"
   addresses so the impact of the proposal on IKEv2 implementations can
   be kept minimal.

   As in the standard IKEv2 ([IKEv2] section 2.4 4th paragraph) the
   initiator has to reject cryptographically invalid fake IKE_SA_INIT
   replies so there is no new attack against the initiator side.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The initial idea was in a Kilian Weniger's message about HA
   assignment.  Jean-Michel Combes, speaking for a Mobile IPv6/NEMO
   operator, insisted to improve the current HA discovery to HA
   assignment.  Kero Kivinen checked whether the proposal introduces new
   security issue and whether it is reasonably easy to implement.
