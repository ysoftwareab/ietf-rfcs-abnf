           Requirements of Localised Congestion Notification
           draft-lei-ecn-localised-congestion-notification-00

Abstract

   This document introduces analyzes of ECN(Explicit Congestion
   Notification)in case of congestion of local links. 3GPP adopts and
   specifies shared channel for multiple user equipments in a cell.
   Other last mile access systems (e.g. xDSL access and Frame Relay
   access) have to handle congestion since bandwidth multiplexing is
   most likely considered for reducing unnecessary cost.  Therefore,
   congestion in access network is to inform user equipments in case of
   traffic congestion utilizing congestion notification concepts and
   similar mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   ECN [RFC3168], a proposed standard document, defines the ECN field in
   the IP header, and specifies the semantics for the code points for
   the ECN field.  These are all unicast protocols which negotiate the
   use of ECN during the initial connection establishment handshake
   (supporting incremental deployment, and checking if ECN marked
   packets pass all middleboxes on the path).

   Basically, ECN is an end to end solution involving endpoints and
   intermediate entities in the transport path.  The ECN solution
   requires that terminals and intermediate nodes (e.g. router and
   firewall) in the path to support ECN functions.  Otherwise, the whole
   solution does not fulfill the requirements to mechanisms of ECN.  The
   ECN also updates the definition of the Differentiated Services Field
   (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers with optional ECN fields.
   The ECN mechanism originally includes the associations with
   congestion control and avoidance algorithms of TCP [RFC0793].  The
   problem is that this end to end solution highly relies on the
   supports of intermediate node in the path.  Since, there exist some
   middleboxes (firewalls, load balancers, or intrusion detection
   systems) in the Internet that either drop a TCP SYN packet configured
   to negotiate ECN, or respond with a RST.

   Besides the congestion appears in backbones of Tier 1 or Tier 2
   service providers, the most of traffic congestion seem happen in
   access network due to a lot of reasons.  For example, the ADSL
   multiplexer is likely to multiplex traffic, but multiplexer would not
   avoid congestion in particular periods (e.g. rush hour of
   transportation system).  Another example is 3GPP LTE architecture
   which specifies shared logic channel in particular cell with very
   high capacity.  However, even though terminals use low class traffic
   (e.g the traffic class only insure best effort service.), the
   capacity of the shared channel could be exhausted by applications
   which generates huge number of traffic.  In general, some problems
   could happy or have appeared in network, all indicate that the
   congestion of access network is likely critical issue to usages of
   congestion notifications in next generation networks.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements

   In this section, the author tries to introduce requirements of
   localized ECN mechanism.

   The goals of localized ECN are:

   a.  Provide a locolized congestion notification mechanism extending
   the scope of ECN solution to notify congestion only happened in
   access network;

   b.  The localized ECN mechanism should support notification of
   congestion at access network in spite of intermediate supports in the
   whole path;

   c.  The localized congestion notification mechanism should be
   compliant with the ECN solution, and support the back compatibility
   to ECN solution.

   Therefore, the concluded requirements are,

   the localized ECN mechanism:

   a.  MUST be able to notify congestion of access network to the local
   senders which contributes to the uplink congestion.

   b.  MUST be able to notify congestion of access network to the local
   receivers which receive data contributing to the downlink congestion.

   c.  MUST be able to notify the uplink congestion and downlink
   congestion of access network to senders and receivers.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD


5.  IANA Considerations

   There have been no IANA considerations so far in this document.
