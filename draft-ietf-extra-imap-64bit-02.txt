               64bit body part and message sizes in IMAP4
                   draft-ietf-extra-imap-64bit-02.txt

Abstract

   This document defines an IMAPv4rev1 extension that extends the
   existing IMAPv4rev1 32 Bit message and body part sizes to 63 bit.
   Both the base IMAP specification (RFC 3501) and several extensions
   are updated.

1.  Introduction

   IMAP [RFC3501] only allows body parts or message sizes which are 32
   bit.  This document introduces an IMAP extension that allows for
   message and body part sizes to be 63 bit.  63-bit values were chosen
   instead of 64-bit values in order to make implementations on various
   platforms (such as Java) easier.

   The client wishing to use this extension MUST issue ENABLE 64BIT.
   Refer [RFC5161] for the usage of ENABLE command.

Internet-Draft 64bit body part and message sizes in IMAP4   October 2017


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

3.  64bit Extension

   An IMAP server that supports the 64bit extension advertises this by
   including the name 64BIT in its CAPABILITY list in the authenticated
   state.  The server may also advertise this extension before the user
   has logged in.  If this capability is omitted, no information is
   conveyed about the server's status of supporting this extension.

   IMAP server should respond with BAD response for the 64bit message
   size messages sent by the IMAP client unless it issues "ENABLE 64BIT"
   and the server responds with untagged ENABLED response that contains
   64BIT in the current connection.

4.  IMAP Protocol Changes

   This document updates various fields in IMAP [RFC3501] to allow for
   63 bit message sizes and body part sizes.  It also updates the
   following IMAP extensions: QUOTA [RFC2087], BINARY [RFC3516], URL-
   PARTIAL [RFC5550] and APPENDLIMIT [RFC7889].  This document also
   updates the IMAP URL specification [RFC5092] to allow use of such
   message sizes and offsets in URL.

   These changes are described in more details below.

4.1.  Changes to IMAP APPENDLIMIT extension

   When an IMAP server implements both 64BIT and APPENDLIMIT [RFC7889]
   extensions, number64 values (see Section 6) are allowed after the
   "APPENDLIMIT=" capability and "APPENDLIMIT" status data item.

4.2.  Changes to IMAP BINARY extension

   When an IMAP server implements both 64BIT and BINARY [RFC3516]
   extensions, number64 values (see Section 6) are allowed in "literal8"
   and "partial" ABNF non terminals.

Internet-Draft 64bit body part and message sizes in IMAP4   October 2017


4.3.  Changes to IMAP URL-PARTIAL extension and IMAP URL

   When an IMAP server implements both 64BIT and URL-PARTIAL [RFC5550]
   extensions, number64 values (see Section 6) are allowed in the
   "partial-range" ABNF non terminal.  The "partial-range" ABNF non
   terminal is defined in [RFC5092], so it also affects what is allowed
   in IMAP URLs.

4.4.  Changes to IMAP QUOTA extension

   When an IMAP server implements both 64BIT and QUOTA [RFC2087]
   extensions, number64 values (see Section 6) are allowed in resource
   usage and resource limit values.

5.  Examples

   C: t1 CAPABILITY
   S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID 64BIT
   S: t1 OK foo
   C: t2 ENABLE 64BIT
   S: * ENABLED 64BIT
   S: t2 OK foo

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501].

   All alphabetic characters are case-insensitive.  The use of upper or
   lower case characters to define token strings is for editorial
   clarity only.  Implementations MUST accept these strings in a case-
   insensitive fashion.

   [[Would it be helpful to split up ABNF by extension?]]

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

   This document doesn't raise any other security concerns not already
   raised by [RFC3501].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to add "64BIT" to the IMAP Capabilities registry, using
   this document as its reference.
