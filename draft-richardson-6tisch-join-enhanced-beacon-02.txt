    IEEE802.15.4 Informational Element encapsulation of 6tisch Join

            draft-richardson-6tisch-join-enhanced-beacon-02

Abstract

   In TSCH mode of IEEE802.15.4, as described by [RFC8180],
   opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and
   specific channels.  Nodes in a TSCH network typically frequently send
   Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to announce the presence of the network.
   This document provides a mechanism by which small details critical
   for new nodes (pledges) and long sleeping nodes may be carried within
   the Enhanced Beacon.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7554] describes the use of the time-slotted channel hopping
   (TSCH) mode of [ieee802154].  As further details in [RFC8180], an
   Enhanced Beacon is transmitted during a slot designated a broadcast
   slot.

   EDNOTE: Explain why broadcasts are rare, and why we need them.  What
   the Enhanced Beacon is, and what Information Elements are, and how
   the IETF has a subtype for that area.  Explain what kind of things
   could be placed in Information Elements, how big they could be, and
   how they could be compressed.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

1.2.  Layer-2 Synchronization

   As explained in section 6 of [RFC8180], the Enhanced Beacon has a
   number of purposes: synchronization of ASN and Join Metric, timeslot
   template identifier, the channel hopping sequence identifier, TSCH
   SlotFrame and Link IE.

   The Enhanced Beacon (EB) is used by nodes already part of a TSCH
   network to annouce its existance.  Receiving an EB allows a Joining
   Node (pledge) to learn about the network and synchronize to it.  The
   EB may also be used as a means for a node already part of the network
   to re-synchronize [RFC7554].

   There are a limited number of timeslots designated as a broadcast
   slot by each router.  These slots are rare, and with 10ms slots, with
   a slot-frame length of 100, there may be only 1 slot/s for the
   beacon.

1.3.  Layer-3 synchronization IPv6 Router solicitations and
      advertisements

   At layer 3, [RFC2461] defines a mechanism by which nodes learn about
   routers by listening for multicasted Router Advertisements (RA).  If
   no RA is heard within a set time, then a Router Solicitation (RS) may
   be multicast, to which an RA will be received, usually unicast.

   Although [RFC6775] reduces the amount of multicast necessary to do
   address resolution via Neighbor Solicitation messages, it still
   requires multicast of either RAs or RS.  This is an expensive
   operation for two reasons: there are few multicast timeslots for
   unsolicited RAs; if a pledge node does not hear an RA, and decides to
   send a RS (consuming a broadcast aloha slot with unencrypted
   traffic), many unicast RS may be sent in response.

   This is a particularly acute issue for the join process for the
   following reasons:

   1.  use of a multicast slot by even a non-malicious unauthenticated
       node for a Router Solicitation may overwhelm that time slot.

   2.  it may require many seconds of on-time before a new pledge hears
       a Router Soliciation that it can use.

   3.  a new pledge may listen to many Enhanced Beacons before it can
       pick an appropriate network and/or closest Join Assistant to
       attach to.  If it must listen for a RS as well as find the
       Enhanced Beacon, then the process may take a very long time.

2.  Protocol Definition

   [RFC8137] creates a registry for new IETF IE subtypes.  This document
   allocates a new subtype TBD-XXX.

   This document documents a new IE subtype structure is as follows.  As
   explained in [RFC8137] the length of the Sub-Type Content can be
   calculated from the container, so no length information is necessary.

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   TBD-XXX     |R|join priority|         network ID            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------+                               |
   |                           network ID                          |
   +                               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      network ID               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   J  the Join prority value contains a number from 0 to 0x7f.  Lower
      numbers are considered to be a higher preference.  A priority of
      0x7f indicates that the announcer should never be considered as a
      viable proxy.  Lower value indicates willing to act as a Join
      Proxy as described in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

   R  the Router Advertisement flag is set if the sending node will act
      as a Router for host-only nodes that need addressing via unicast
      Router Solicitation messages.

   network ID  this is an opaque 16-byte identifier that uniquely
      identifies this network, potentially among many networks that are
      operating in the same frequencies in overlapping physical space.

   In a 6tisch network, where RPL is used as the mesh routing protocol,
   the network ID SHOULD be constructed from a SHA256 hash of the
   DODAGID of the network.  The result will be a 32-byte hash, and the
   right-most 16-bytes should be used as the network ID.

2.1.  Protocol Example

   Here will be three examples of processing.

3.  Security Considerations

   All of the contents of this Information Element are sent in the
   clear.  The containing Enhanced Beacon is not encrypted, but may be
   authenticated to nodes which have already received network-wide
   keying material.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   The use of a network ID may reveal information about the network.
   The use of a SHA256 hash of the DODAGID, rather than using the
   DODAGID directly provides some cover the addresses used within the
   network.  The DODAGID is usually the IPv6 address of the root of the
   RPL mesh.

   An interloper with a radio sniffer would be able to use the network
   ID to map out the extend of the mesh network.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate a new number TBD-XXX from Registry IETF IE Sub-type ID.
   This entry should be called 6tisch-Join-Info.

Appendix A.  Change history

   This is an evolution of an earlier proposal which provided for
   storing an entire IPv6 Router Adverisement in an Informational
   Element.  It was deemed too general a solution, possibly subject to
   mis-use.  This proposal restricts the use to just the key pieces of
   information required.
