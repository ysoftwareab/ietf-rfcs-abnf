Abstract

   This document  identifies the basic information to be handled by
   Service Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) when
   considering the deployment of value-added IP service offerings over
   the Internet. Such IP service offerings can be provided together with
   a given quality of service (QoS), which is expected to be defined in
   such SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services are
   likely to be provided over the whole Internet, their corresponding

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


   QoS will be based upon a set of technical parameters that both
   customers and services providers will have to agree upon. From this
   perspective, this draft aims at listing (and promoting a standard
   formalism for) a set of basic parameters which will actually compose
   the elementary contents of a SLS.

   Such a specification effort tries to address the following concerns:

   - Provide a standard set of information to be negotiated between a
   customer and a service provider or amongst services providers within
   the context of processing a SLS;

   - Provide the corresponding semantics of such information, so that it
   might be appropriately modeled and processed by the above-mentioned
   parties (in an automated fashion).

1. Introduction

1.1 Motivation

   This document is presented to the IETF community (and the Diffserv WG
   more specifically) to gauge the interest for advancing the work on
   the specification of a SLS definition, its semantics and its
   potential negotiation protocol(s). This interest may be gauged at a
   future BoF session (e.g., San Diego meeting), specifically on the
   subject of SLS negotiation across administrative boundaries (customer
   - provider; provider - provider).

1.2 Objective

   This document presents an outline for the definition of a Service
   Level Specification format, the semantics that go behind this
   representation, and some early ideas on the requirements on
   negotiation of SLSs.

   The need to have such an agreed set of Service Level Specification
   parameters and semantics is manifold.

   First, it is necessary to be able to allow for a highly developed
   level of automation and dynamic negotiation of Service Level
   Specifications between customers and providers. Automation and
   dynamics are indeed helpful in providing customers (as well as
   providers) the technical means for the dynamic provisioning of
   quality of service. The automation in itself is e.g. necessary to
   allow roaming (dial-in) and to enable mobile users to have access and
   negotiate a transport Service Level, independent of their point of
   attachment to the network.

   Second, the design and the deployment of Bandwidth Broker
   capabilities [TWOBIT] in a multi-vendor environment requires a
   standardized set of semantics for Service Level Specifications being
   negotiated at different locations:

      - between the customer and the service provider (namely between
      the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and its point of attachment
      to the IP network managed by the service provider);

      - within an administrative domain (for intra-domain SLS
      negotiation purposes);

      - between administrative domains (for inter-domain negotiation
      purposes).

   While the representation and semantics behind a Service Level

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


   Specification need to be standardized, this document does not assume
   that the syntax, nor the SLS negotiation protocol need to be uniquely
   defined. E.g, the negotiation could make use of various other
   protocols such as http, rsvp, IPCP, DHCP, etc. The latter is ffs, and
   as such not part of this document.

   The document is structured as follows.

   Section 2 lists the basic assumptions underlying this work and some
   terminology.

   Section 3 describes the parameters of the Service Level Specification
   (template). This draft only describes the semantics of the SLS-
   attributes, omitting all implementation details as for instance the
   attribute data types (at this moment).

   Section 4 provides some examples of relevant SLS specifications, with
   the aim to show the usage of the templates. The SLS formalism defined
   in section 3 allows making a distinction between qualitative and
   quantitative SLSs:

      - SLSs depicting qualitative services should yield the
      specification of relative QoS indicators, such as a low IP
      datagram loss ratio. From this standpoint, best effort traffic is
      expected to be qualified by a SLS of that range of qualitative
      services.

      - SLSs depicting quantitative services should yield the accurate
      measurement of QoS indicators, such as e.g., transit delay.

   Sections 5 and 6 finally describe some SLS (protocol) negotiation
   requirements and security considerations respectively.

   The material presented in this draft derives from work within the
   IST-TEQUILA project [TEQUILA].

2. Basic assumptions and terminology

   The basic assumption of this draft is that IP services will be
   deployed over a public IP infrastructure, which will be (partly if
   not completely) composed of diffserv-aware network elements ([RFC-
   2475], [DS-MODEL]). These network elements are able to process Per
   Hop Behaviors (PHBs), including the Assured Forwarding PHB ([RFC-
   2597]), and the Expedited Forwarding PHB ([RFC-2598].

   Customers of such services include Internet Service Providers (ISP),
   who may well establish QoS-based peering agreements between
   themselves, and usual customers of ISPs, like those who compose both

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


   the residential and the corporate market.

   The terminology used in this draft is in agreement with the DiffServ
   Working Group terminology introduced and specified in [RFC-2475],
   section 1.2 "terminology".

3. SLS content & template

   The following describes the attributes of the Service Level
   Specification. It should be remarked that some SLS-features are not
   yet specified in this draft. For example, the Internet2 QoS Working
   Group specifies a SLS for the EF-based Premium Service [QBONE]. One
   of the attributes, i.e. "Route", is used for inter-domain routing
   aspects. This and other SLS features are for further study.

3.1. Scope

   The scope of a SLS associated to a given service offering indicates
   where the Quality of Service (QoS) policy for that specific service
   offering is to be enforced. Therefore the scope uniquely identifies
   the geographical/topological region over which the QoS is to be
   enforced by indicating the boundaries of that region.

   A SLS is associated with uni-directional traffic flows. Note however
   that this does not exclude the provisioning by providers of
   bidirectional contracts, by combining one or more SLSs.


   The associated scope of the SLS MUST be expressed by a couple of
   ingress and egress interfaces. Ingress/egress denote respectively the
   entry/exit points of the IP packets relative to the region (network).

      Scope = (ingress, egress) with ingress/egress defined as
        - Ingress: interface identifier | set of interface identifiers |
        all

        - Egress : interface identifier | set of interface identifiers |
        all


   Remarks:

   - "|" denotes an exclusive OR.

   - "all" is logically equal to unspecified.

   The semantics allows for the following combinations of (ingress,
   egress) interfaces:



TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                  [Page 5]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


      - (1,1) -  one-to-one communication

      - (1,N) - one-to-many communication (N>1)

      - (1,all) - one-to-any communication

      - (N,1) - many-to-one communication (N>1)

      - (all,1) - any-to-one communication

   Remark that this excludes e.g. the many-to-many communication. Either
   ingress OR egress MUST be specified to exactly ONE interface
   identifier (with a non-exclusive OR).

   In the sequel SLSs with an associated scope (topology) of (1,1) ;
   (1,N) ; (N,1) will be called respectively Pipe, Hose and Funnel SLSs.

   Disclaimer:

   An ingress (or egress) interface identifier should uniquely determine
   the boundary link as defined in [RFC-2475] on which packets
   arrive/depart at the border of a DS domain. This link identifier MAY
   be an IP address, but it may also be determined by a layer-two
   identifier in case of e.g. ethernet, or for unnumbered links like in
   e.g., PPP-access configurations. The interface identifier(s) may also
   implicitly be derived from the source or destination address
   information in the Flow Identification field (see next). More
   detailed specifications are for further study.

3.2. Flow Identification

   The flow identification (Flow Id) of a SLS associated to a given
   service offering indicates for which IP packets the QoS policy for
   that specific service offering is to be enforced.

   A Flow Id identifies a stream of IP datagrams sharing at least one
   common characteristic. A SLS Flow Id MAY formally be specified by
   setting one or more of the following attributes:

      Flow Id = (DSCP, source information, destination information,
      application information)

         - Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) = specified value
         [RFC-2474]

         - Source information = source address | set of  source
         addresses | set of source prefixes | all




TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                  [Page 6]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


         - Destination information = destination address | set of
         destination addresses | set of destination prefixes | all

         - Application information = protocol number | protocol number
         and source port, destination port | all

      Note: "all" is again logically equal to unspecified.


   Thus, the Flow Id may be expressed by information attributes related
   to the source/destination nodes, the application or the DS field in
   the IP header. The Flow Id provides the necessary information for
   classifying the packets at a DS boundary node.

   This datagram classification can either be Behaviour Aggregate (BA)
   or Multi-Field (MF)classification based.

   In case of BA-classification [RFC-2475], the DSCP attribute MUST be
   specified and the other attributes MUST NOT be specified.

   In case of MF-classification all attributes MAY be specified. Remark
   that MF classification may as well depict micro-flows as aggregate
   flows [DS-MODEL].

   Note that there are restrictions involved in combining scope and flow
   identification within a certain SLS instance.

3.3 Traffic Conformance Testing

   Traffic Conformance Testing is the set of actions which uniquely
   identities the "in-profile" and "out-of profile" (or excess) packets
   of an IP stream (identified by Flow-Id). Traffic Conformance Testing
   will usually be done at a DS-boundary node.

   The SLS specifies the Traffic Conformance Testing as a combination of
   the Traffic Conformance Parameters and the Traffic Conformance
   Algorithm. The Traffic Conformance Parameters describe the reference
   values the traffic (identified by the Flow ID.) will have to comply
   with, thus yielding the notions of "In" and "Out" of profile
   traffics. The Traffic Conformance Algorithm is the mechanism enabling
   unambiguously to identify all "in" or "out" of profile packets based
   on these Conformance parameters.

   The following gives a (non-exhaustive) list of potential conformance
   parameters.

      - Peak rate p




TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                  [Page 7]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


      - Token bucket rate r

      - bucket depth b

      - Minimum MTU m

      - Maximum MTU M

   Notes:

   Examples:

      - Conformance parameters = token bucket parameters (b, r);
      conformance algorithm = token bucket algorithm.

      - Conformance parameters = peak rate p; conformance algorithm =
      (flow) rate must be smaller than p (at all time scales)

      - Conformance parameters = maximum MTU; conformance algorithm =
      all packets allowed with size smaller than MTU

   The detailed specification of these parameters together with
   conformance algorithms is for further study.

3.4. Excess Treatment

   This section describes how the service provider will process excess
   traffic, i.e. out-of-profile traffic. The process takes place after
   Traffic Conformance Testing, described previously.

   Excess traffic may be dropped, shaped and/or remarked. The SLS MUST
   specify the appropriate action by the following attribute.

      - Excess Treatment



   If Excess Treatment is not indicated, then excess traffic is dropped.
   Depending on the appropriate action, more parameters MAY be required
   (for further study).

      - If excess traffic is shaped, then shaping parameters should be
      given, e.g. the (output) shaping rate.

      - If excess traffic is marked or remarked, then Marking parameters
      should be given, e.g. "coloring" the packets with drop precedence
      equal to "red". Packet reordering MUST be avoided when a remarking
      operation occurs.

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


3.5. Performance Guarantees

   The performance parameters describe the service guarantees the
   network offers to the customer for the packet stream described by the
   Flow Id and over the geographical/topological extent given by the
   scope. All service guarantees are for the in-profile traffic; no
   guarantees are given for excess (out-of-profile) packets.

   There are four performance parameters:

      - delay | optional quantile

      - jitter | optional quantile

      - packet loss

      - throughput

      The following definitions always consider the (measurable)
      performance parameters related to the packet stream specified by
      the Flow Id.

      The delay and jitter indicate respectively the maximum packet
      transfer delay and packet transfer delay variation from ingress to
      egress.

      Delay and jitter may either be specified as worst case
      (deterministic) bounds or as quantiles. Indeed, the worst case
      delay/jitter bounds will be very rare events and customers may
      find measurements of e.g. 99.5th percentile a more relevant
      empirical gauge of delay/jitter.

      The packet loss indicates the packet loss probability for in-
      profile packets from ingress to egress


                    lost in-profile packets between ingress and egress
      packet loss = --------------------------------------------------
                    offered (injected) in-profile packets at ingress


   The throughput is the rate measured at egress counting all (non-lost)
   injected in-profile packets at ingress.

   Remark about the relation between throughput and excess treatment.

      - If excess traffic is allowed (shaped/marked), then "throughput"
      indicates a minimum guarantee. It is the guaranteed throughput for



TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                  [Page 9]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


      in-profile packets while extra available resources may eventually
      be allocated to the out-of-profile traffic.

      - If excess traffic is dropped, then "throughput" indicates a
      maximum guarantee.


   Disclaimer about throughput

   The performance parameter "throughput" as indicated above is the
   guaranteed throughput the network provider offers to the customer
   (between ingress and egress). There is however a tight relationship
   between packet loss (p), throughput (R) and conformance parameters
   (if all indicated of course).

   Take e.g. the token bucket parameters (b,r) as conformance
   parameters. If the packet loss is small (e.g. 10E-6), then the
   network (implicitly) guarantees a throughput R = r. Therefore it is
   not yet clear for the authors whether the (guaranteed) throughput R
   must be specified in the SLS as a separate parameter, or whether R
   can be derived from e.g. the token bucket parameters.

   This issue is further study.


   Quantitative performance guarantees

   A performance parameter is said to be quantified if its value is
   specified to a numeric (quantitative) value.

   The service guarantee offered by the SLS is said to be quantitative
   IF at least one of the 4 performance parameters is quantified.


   Qualitative performance guarantees

   If non of the SLS performance parameters are quantified, then the
   performance parameters "delay" and "packet loss" MAY be "qualified".

   Possible qualitative values (for delay and/or loss): high, medium,
   low.

   Relative delay guarantees:

      - gold service : value = low

      - silver service : value = medium




TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                 [Page 10]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


      - bronze service : value = high or not indicated

   Relative loss guarantees

      - green service : value = low

      - yellow service : value = medium

      - red service : value = high or not indicated

   The quantification of relative difference between <high/medium/low>
   is a provider policy (e.g. high = 2 x  medium ; medium = 2 x low).

   The above taxonomy yields the following combinations of qualitative
   services.

    -------------------------------------------------------
    |\ delay |             |               |               |
    | \------| low         | medium        |high           |
    |  loss  |             |               |               |
    |------------------------------------------------------|
    | low    | gold green  | silver green  | bronze green  |
    | medium | gold yellow | silver yellow | bronze yellow |
    | high   | gold red    | silver red    | bronze red    |
    |------------------------------------------------------|
                            Combinations table

   The service guarantee offered by the SLS is said to be qualitative if
   it is NOT quantitative and either delay or loss (non-exclusive) are
   qualified to "medium" or "low", i.e. excluding bronze/red from the
   above.

   The service guarantee offered by the SLS is said to be best-effort if
   it is NOT quantified nor qualified.


3.6. Service schedule

   The service schedule indicates the start time and end time of the
   service, i.e. when is the service available.

   This might be expressed as collection of the following parameters:

      - Time of the day range

      - Day of the week range

      - Month of the year range



TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                 [Page 11]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


   Some examples are:
      - Time of the day range
        08h00-18h00

      - Day of the week range
        A single day

        A group of sequential days

      - Month of the year range
        A single month

        A group of sequential months

      - Year range
        A single year

        A group of sequential years

   Remark: service schedule "from now on" [now, infinity] can be
   captured by putting the above to their full range.

3.7. Reliability

   Reliability indicates the maximum allowed mean downtime per year
   (MDT) and the maximum allowed time to repair (TTR) in case of service
   breakdown (e.g. in case of cable cut).

   The Mean Down Time might be expressed in minutes per year and the
   Maximum Time To Repair might be expressed in seconds.

3.8 Others

   Other parameters such as route, security, etc... remain for further
   study.

4. Service Level Specification examples.

   Within this section a number of example instantiations of SLSs are
   presented to illustrate the potential use of the SLS template defined
   above.

4.1. Virtual Leased Line

   The following specifies the SLS for a (uni-directional) VLL with
   quantified throughput guarantee (with guaranteed throughput of e.g 1
   Mbps) and packet loss




TEQUILA consortium        Expires January 2001                 [Page 12]

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


   - Scope: one-to-one communication (Pipe model), (Ingress, Egress)
   specified

   - Flow specification: DSCP-value (e.g DSCP indicating the EF-PHB).
   Another possibility is setting the (source,destination) IP-addresses.

   - Traffic Conditioning: leaky bucket (b,r), r = 1 Mbps

   - Excess Treatment = dropping. Thus only in-profile packets are
   allowed.

   - Performance Parameters: guaranteed throughput R = r. packet loss =
   10E-6.

   - Service Schedule: may be indicated

   - Reliability: may be indicated


4.2. Real-time micro-flows

   - Scope: one-to-one communication (Pipe model), (Ingress, Egress)
   specified

   - Flow specification: (source IP-address, destination IP-address,
   source port number, destination port number, protocol)

   - Traffic Conditioning: leaky bucket (b,r), peak rate p= r = 64 Kbps

   - Excess Treatment = dropping.

   - Performance Parameters: delay = 10 msec, packet loss = 10E-3,
   guaranteed throughput R = r.

4.3 Minimum rate guarantee with allowed excess

   The following could be for bulk FTP traffic that requires a minimum
   throughput, but would take everything it can get (TCP). Also adaptive
   applications, like video streaming, that however require a minimum
   throughput for the service.

   - Scope: one-to-one (Pipe)

   - Flow specification: e.g. DSCP-value indicating a possible AF-PBH.

   - Traffic Conformance Parameters: (b,r) MUST be indicated (peak rate
   is optional)

   - Excess Treatment: Remarking MUST be indicated (excess is given a
   higher drop precedence)

   - Performance guarantees: guaranteed throughput R = r.


4.4. Qualitative Olympic services

   The following SLS is meant for the Olympic Service. It could be used
   for differentiating applications such as web-browsing and e-mail
   traffic.

   SLS 1 (on-line web-browsing) - Scope: one-to-one (pipe) or one-to-
   many (hose)

   - Flow specification: MAY be indicated

   - Traffic Conformance Parameters: token parameters (b,r) The token
   bucket rate r indicates an (average) maximum Committed Access Rate
   (CAR) for which "better-than-best-effort" treatment will be applied.

   - Excess Treatment: remarking.

   - Performance Parameter: Delay and Packet loss are indicated as
   "low": gold/green class

   SLS2 : (background e-mail traffic)

   This is identical to SLS1 but targeting the silver/green class.

4.5. The Funnel service

   The service offered by the funnel model is primarily a protection
   service: the customer wants to set a maximum on the amount of traffic
   (characterized by a DSCP) entering his network. It could e.g. be used
   for business customers to restrict the amount of web browsing traffic
   entering their network.

                  /---------------\
                  |Network   _____|______ B
                  |    _____/     |
       A__________|___.___________|______ C
         /_____   |    _____      |
         \a(out)  |         \_____|_______D
                  \---------------/

   In [Figure 4], the customer A requires that the traffic entering his
   network from B,C and D does not exceed the rate a_out.

   - Scope: Funnel (N|all,1).

   - Flow specification: DSCP MUST be indicated. The filter (see below)
   is applied to all traffic characterized by the DSCP -value.

   - Traffic Conformance Parameters: (b, r) MUST be indicated. The token
   bucket parameters indicate the maximum allowed throughput (r = a_out)
   towards the customer network on the specified egress interface. This
   maximum or filter is applied to all packets marked with the DSCP-
   value indicated above.

   - Excess treatment: dropping (this is actually the service offered by
   the network).

   - Performance Parameter: not specified.


4.6. Best effort traffic

   - Scope : all models

   - Flow specification : none

   - Traffic Conformance Parameters: if not indicated, then the full
   link capacity is allowed

   - Excess Treatment: not specified

   - Performance Parameters: none

   - Service Schedule: may be indicated.

   - Reliability: may be indicated.

5. SLS negotiation requirements

   [This section is informational and preliminary. More detailed study
   is required.]

   A major goal of the availability of an SLS template is helping in the
   deployment of dynamical SLS negotiation procedures between customer
   and providers or between providers. This draft only discussed the SLS
   template and its basic contents. The SLS negotiation protocol is for
   further study. The following lists a number of conditions which
   should be met by a (to be defined) SLS negotiation protocol.

Internet Draft     draft-tequila-diffserv-sls-00.txt          July, 2000


   The SLS negotiation protocol MUST allow for:

   - Original service requests, according the components of the
   specified SLS.

   - Service acknowledgement (ACK), indicating agreement with the
   requested service level.

   - Service rejection (NAK) but indicating the possibility of offering
   a closely related service (or indication of alternative DSCP to use
   for a particular service). The reply message may indicate the related
   offering by overwriting the proposed SLS attributes (hints).

   - Service rejection (REJECT) indicating  incapability of providing
   the service.

   - The ACK/NACK procedures require a reliable transport mode for such
   a negotiation protocol.

   - Service modification from both user and provider.

   The following are further requirements for the overall network
   architecture which SHOULD be fulfilled.

      - The protocol should be able to interact with feedback of events
   related to the service. For example performance degradation MAY
   result in re-negotiation of the SLS.

      - The  protocol should preferentially make use of / be an
   extension of existing specifications protocol design work available
   such as RSVP ([RFC-2205]) or PPP/IPCP ([RFC-1661]).


6. Security considerations

   The information which will yield the instantiation of a SLS template
   to address the specific requirements of a customer in terms of the
   quality associated to the service it has subscribed to may require
   the activation of security features so that:

   - Identification and authentication of the requesting entity needs to
   be performed;

   - Identification and authentication of the peering entities which
   will participate in the SLS negotiation process needs to be
   performed;

   - Preservation of the confidentiality of the information to be

   conveyed during the SLS negotiation and instantiation procedures
   between the peering entities is a MUST.
