Abstract

   This	document is a draft of a revision to RFC 1632: A Revised Catalog
   of Available	X.500 Implementations and is based on the results of
   data	collection via a WWW home page that enabled implementors to
   submit new or updated descriptions of currently available
   implementations of X.500, including commercial  products and	openly
   available offerings.	RFC 1632 is a revision of RFC 1292.  We
   contacted each contributor to RFC 1632 to request an	update and
   published the URL of	the WWW	home page survey template in several
   mailing lists to encourage the submission of	new product
   descriptions.

   This	document contains detailed description of TBD X.500
   implementations - DSAs, DUAs, and DUA interfaces.

1.  Introduction

   This	document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,
   including commercial	products and openly available offerings.  For
   the purposes	of this	survey,	we classify X.500 products as,


      DSA

	 A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory
	 functionality,

      DUA

	 A DUA is an OSI application process that represents a user in
	 accessing the Directory and uses the DAP to communicate with a
	 DSA, and

      DUA Interface

	 A DUA Interface is an application process that	represents a
	 user in accessing the Directory using either DAP but supporting
	 only a	subset of the DAP functionality	or a protocol different
	 from DAP to communicate with a	DSA or DUA.

   Section 2 of	this document contains a listing of implementations
   cross referenced by keyword.	 This list should aid in identifying
   implementations that	meet your criteria.

   To compile this catalog, the	IDS Working Group solicited input from
   the X.500 community by publishing a URL for a set of	on-line
   description forms deployed on the WWW as a home page	on an InterNIC
   server. This	URL
   (http://www.internic.net/projects/x500catalog/catalogtop.html) was
   advertised on the following directory-related mailing lists:
   iso@nic.ddn.mil, isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,
   ids@merit.edu, ietf-asid@umich.edu, mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com,
   nadf-l@ema.org, and dssig@nist.gov.

   Readers are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the	forms
   and content	of  this  memo.	 New submissions are welcome.  Please
   direct input	to  the	 Integrated  Directory	Services  (IDS)	Working
   Group (ietf-ids@umich.edu)  or  to  the authors.  IDS will produce
   new versions	of this	document when a	significant number of
   substantive comments	have been received or when significant updates
   and/or modifications	to X.500-related standards documents have been

INTERNET-DRAFT	    X.500 Implementations Catalog-96	    23 June 1996


   ratified.  This will	be determined by the IDS chairpersons.

1.1  Purpose

   The Internet	has experienced	a steady growth	in X.500 piloting
   activities.	This document hopes to provide an easily accessible
   source of information on X.500 implementations for those who	wish to
   consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.

1.2  Scope

   This	document contains descriptions of both free and	commercial X.500
   implementations.  It	does not provide instructions on how to	install,
   run,	or manage these	implementations.  The descriptions and indices
   are provided	to make	the readers aware of available options and thus
   enable more informed	choices.

1.3 Disclaimer

   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and	vendors,
   and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors to
   ensure uniformity and readability, but cannot guarantee the accuracy
   or completeness of the descriptions,	nor the	stability of the
   implementations.

1.4  Overview

   Section 1 contains introductory information.

   Section 2 contains a	list of	keywords, their	definitions, a cross
   reference of	the X.500 implementations by these keywords and	a table
   containing implementor name,	implementor abreviation, and the page of
   this	document on which the description begins for a particular
   implementor.

   Section 3 contains the X.500	implementation descriptions.

   Section 4 has a list	of references.

   Section 6 lists the editors'	addresses.

1.5  Acknowledgments

   The creation	of this	catalog	would not have been possible without the
   efforts of the description authors and the members of the IDS Working
   Group.  Our special thanks to the editors of	RFC 1632, Linda

   Millington and Sri Sataluri who graciously contributed the nroff
   source file used to structure their version of the catalog.

2.  Keywords

   Keywords are	abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.
   The list of keywords	defined	below was derived from the
   implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed
   by a	keyword	either as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,
   reference to	a particular capability	in the implementation
   description text, or	(2) input from the implementation description
   author(s).

2.1  Keyword Definitions

   This	section	contains keyword definitions.  They have been organized
   and grouped by functional category.	The definitions	are ordered
   first alphabetically	by keyword category, and second	alphabetically
   by implementation name within keyword category.

2.1.1  Availability

   Available via FTP

      Implementation is	available using	FTP.

   Commercially	Available

3.  Implementation Descriptions

   In the following pages you will find	descriptions of	X.500 implemen-
   tations listed in alphabetical order.  In the case of name colli-
   sions, the name of the responsible organization, in square brackets,
   has been used to distinguish	the implementations.  Note that
   throughout this section, the	page header reflects the name of the
   implementation, not the date	of the document.  The descriptions fol-
   low a common	format,	as described below:

   NAME

   The name of the X.500 implementation	and the	name of	the responsible
   organization.  Implementations with a registered trademark indicate
   this	by appending "(tm)", e.g., GeeWhiz(tm).

   ABSTRACT

   A brief description of the application.  This section may optionally
   contain a list of the pilot projects	in which the application is
   being used.

   COMPLIANCE with X.500-1988 (applicable only for DSAs	and DUAs)

   A statement of compliance with respect to the 1988 CCITT Recommenda-
   tions X.500-X.521 [CCITT-88], specifically Section 9	of X.519, or the
   1988	NIST OIW Stable	Implementation Agreements [NIST-88].

ABSTRACT

The CXDUA is a Windows 3.1 DUA that has	been derrived from a highly
portable and flexible Unix based Administrative	Directory User Agent.
The goal of the	original design	was to support features	to assist a
directory administrator	in managing the	directory.  These features
include	a highly portable GUI, Entry Templates,	Entry Lists, Batch
Operations and Directory Control Functions.

Both the Windows and the Unix versions support strong authentication.

The Unix DUA has been used in various DMS and NSA pilot	projects.

INTERNET-DRAFT			DC X500			    23 June 1996


NAME

   DC X500

   Data	Connection Ltd
   100 Church Street
   Enfield
   Middlesex
   EN2 6BQ
   UK

ABSTRACT

   DC X500 provides a truly scalable X.500 based enterprise directory
   server with the necessary architectural flexibility to enable
   integration with existing database and directory technologies.

   From	a pure X.500 standpoint, DC X500 provides a full function
   state-of-the-art DSA	implementation.


	 * Architected from scratch according to the 1993 X.500
	   standards (i.e. not a 1988 DSA with 1993 features grafted on)

	 * Support for all the key X.500 OSI protocols:

	    * Directory	Access Protocol	(DAP) for user access

	    * Directory	System Protocol	(DSP) for distributed DSA
	      comunications

	    * Directory	Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP) to support
	      replication between servers to give improved performance
	      in a distributed network

	 * Support of the 1993 Basic Access Control and	Simplified
	   Access Control models

	 * Support for the key Internet	X.500 related standards:

	    * integrated Lightweight DAP (LDAP)for DUA access

	    * Madman MIBs for easy integration with SNMP

   The DC X500 architecture is based on	Data Connection's underlying
   product architecture	which has evolved since	1987 and includes:




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 54]

INTERNET-DRAFT			DC X500			    23 June 1996


	 * genuine multi-threaded implementation

	 * true	portability (the product is available on a range of
	   operating systems e.g Windows NT, AIX, HP-UX. OS/2 etc and it
	   is possible to port the core	technology to any
	   hardware/software platform)

	 * secure service recording for	operation tracking and billing

	 * support for system monitoring (both alarms and statistics)
   Key product features	include:

	 * Name	resolution and integrated use of Search	Indices	based on
	   2-3 trees leads to high performance operation evaluation
	   (subsecond response times on	million	entry DSAs)

	 * Generic schema support based	on 1993	concepts that allows
	   customers to	tailor the schema to meet their	precise	data
	   structuing requirements

	 * System recycle time is minimised (e.g. DC X500 can be backed
	   up while running and	search indices are dynamically updated),
	   helping achieve the goal of continuous (24x7) availability
	   and high reliability.

	 * No artificial software constraints are imposed resulting in a
	   truly scalable product - assuming the availability of the
	   necessary hardware DC X500 can be configured	to support
	   millions of entries in a single DSA.

   DC X500 is certified	for used within	the Paradise Pilot project.  The
   product has also undergone interoperability testing at the EuroSInet
   interoperability workshops in Europe.

INTERNET-DRAFT		  Directory Enquiries		    23 June 1996


NAME

DE

ABSTRACT

DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to	be a simple-to-use DUA
interface, suitable for	the naive user,	and suitable for running as a
public access dua.  it will work on any	terminal.  The user is presented
with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for person's name  department
organization  country.	There is extensive on-line help.  The matching
algorithms are such that near matches are presented to the user	before
less good matches.

There have been	a few minor enhancements since the description in RFC
1632.  The power searching feature still sets DE apart from most other
DUAs - this allows a user to search for	an entry even when they	do not
know the name of the organisation in which the person works - you still
have to	specify	the country.  DE also allows UFN style searching.  DE
uses slightly different	search algorithms depending on whether it is
accessing part of the Directory	mastered by a Quipu DSA	- Quipu	DSAs
tend to	use lots of replication	and so encourage searching.  DE
incorporates a QOS feature where it maintains a	database of past
information availability and DSA responsiveness.  Translations exist
into at	least 4	different languages.

DE runs	over ISODE DAP and University of Michigan LDAP.	 There is a
version	of DE, called DOS-DE, which has	been ported to DOS, and	this
uses LDAP.

DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is	used as	the
PARADISE public	access dua. You	can test the software by telnet	to
directory.ja.net and logging in	as dua -- no password required.

NAME

   Digital X.500 Directory Server
   Digital Equipment Corporation

   This	single entry covers a number of	different products

ABSTRACT

   The Digital X.500 Directory Services	product	set includes a directory
   server product and a	variety	directory user agents, as well as a
   directory synchronizer utility.

   The Digital X.500 Directory Server product provides a high
   performance DSA implemented according to the	1993 edition of	the
   standard. The InfoBroker Server product extends this	to provide the
   server component for	LDAP and WWW user agents.  Features of these
   servers include:


	 * Integrated multi-protocol support allowing concurrent DAP,
	   DSP,	DISP and DOP access over OSI and TCP/IP	(using RFC1006)
	   protocols.

	 * Indexed database (DIB) to support high-performance searching
	   and sophisticated matching including	approximate match.

	 * A DIB based on the 1993 edition Extended Information	Models.

	 * Support for chaining	and referrals in support of a
	   distributed DIB

	 * Support for the 1993	edition	Basic Access Control scheme.

	 * Configurable	schema based on	the 1993 edition (including
	   attributes, object classes, structure rules,	name forms).

	 * Support for 1993 edition Shadowing using the	DISP and DOP
	   protocol, including both incremental	and on-change features
	   for high performance.

	 * Remote management to	control	DSAs and log significant events.

	 * Support for the LDAP	protocols using	the InfoBroker Server

INTERNET-DRAFT		  DIR.X-SYNC(tm) V2.0		    23 June 1996


NAME

DIR.X-SYNC (tm)	V2.0 Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG

ABSTRACT

DIR.X-SYNC V2.0	enables	the synchronization of existing	e-mail address
directories in the X.500-based DIR.X directory service.	The standard
DIR.X, DIR.X-SYNC and DIR.D (all available from	Siemens	Nixdorf)
products are the foundations on	which the corporate directory solutions
can be tailored	to meet	the customer's needs. The corporate directory
then becomes the universal information system within the company.

The user can access corporate directory	information in different ways:


      *	Using DIR.D, SNI's Windows client for the X.500	service, PC
	users can gain easy access to the DIR.X	server containing the
	corporate directory data. The data found can be	transferred to
	other applications by means of DDE, drag and drop or cut and
	paste. (See DIR.D V2.6 for further information).

      *	Query by mail: Authorized users	can access data	stored in the
	central	or distributed directory system	over their own mail
	system.	DIR.X-SYNC retrieves the inquiry transmitted by	mail and
	directs	it on to the X.500 service. The	search results are then
	delivered back to the user by mail.  Using a WWW interface based
	on TCL scripts

Query by mail does not require additional software on the end system.
Each mail system connected to the X.400	backbone (e.g. MS-Mail,	cc:Mail
etc.) can use this function. DIR.X-SYNC	currently supports the address
formats	of the following e-mail	systems:


      *	MAIL.X-OD V2.3

      *	MAIL.2000 V1.2,	AKOM

      *	MS-Mail

      *	cc:Mail

      *	Intelligent Messaging Mail (Banyan)

The standardized ISO-10021 interface for X.400 addresses is supported,




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 87]

INTERNET-DRAFT		  DIR.X-SYNC(tm) V2.0		    23 June 1996


enabling need for extension. This means	that any type of system	capable
of generating this format (e.g.	WordPerfect, Lotus Notes) can be
connected. Address acknowledgment is carried out in ISO	format.

Functions for the administrator:


      *	Export:	Addresses can be exported from local directories. They
	are delivered as mail messages in ASCII	format to the DIR.X-SYNC
	server.

      *	Upload:	The upload server stores the exported local addresses in
	DIR.X as globally valid	X.400 addresses.

      *	Query by Mail: DIR.X-SYNC enables mail members to send a search
	to the DIR.X-SYNC server by e-mail. Using this function,
	authorized administrators of the synchronized directories can
	acquire	copies of the corporate	directory data.

      *	Administration of the DIR.X-SYNC server	with an	administration
	tool which can be used via command line	or a command file.

Other features include:


      *	Replication and	distribution: In addition to the central
	solution with a	single corporate directory server, DIR.X-SYNC
	also supports replicated or distributed	data storage in	DIR.X-
	SYNC server.

      *	Authentication/Authorization: To prevent unauthorized use of the
	corporate directory system, the	O/R addresses of the authorized
	administrators and users are configured	by the DIR.X-SYNC
	administrator. When a query by mail or an update arrives, the
	sender address is compared with	this address.

      *	Logging: In the	case of	error, e.g. incorrect file format, the
	sender (and the	administrator  configurable) are informed of the
	fault by mail. At the same time, the error message is saved in a
	log file for the DIR.X-SYNC administrator. In addition,	a
	"history file" enables the monitoring of the uploads that have
	run or are currently running

INTERNET-DRAFT		   FORUM LOOK'UP(tm)		    23 June 1996


NAME

Forum LOOK'UP (tm)
Telis Systemes & Communications

ABSTRACT

Forum LOOK'UP (tm) is a	Corporate directory solution based on the X.500
recommendations. It includes:


      *	a Directory System Agent (DSA),

      *	Directory User Agents (DUAs).

      *	local network connections

      *	remote workstation access

      *	a WEB and videotex access

      *	data updating tools

      *	a directory editing tool

Forum LOOK'UP is a product based on PIZARRO, the research prototype
developed at INRIA by Christian	Huitema's team,	and commercialized by
Telis, a member	of the France Telecom group.

Characteristics	of the DSA are:


      *	The DAP	and DSP	protocols are provided conformant with X.500
	(88).

      *	The DIB	is maintained in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix file
	system.

      *	Utilities are provided to load and dump	the DIB	from and to
	ASCII text files.

      *	As an option, an ORACLE	V7 database can	also be	used.

      *	The DIT	structure is held in main memory. Frequently used
	attributes may be held in inverted tables in memory to speed up
	searches.




Apple, Rossen						       [Page 93]

INTERNET-DRAFT		   FORUM LOOK'UP(tm)		    23 June 1996


      *	Knowledge management: knowledge	on managed domains is stored in
	Forum LOOK'UP specific attributes of the DSA entries.

      *	Schema:	The X.500 (88),	X.400 (88) and most of the Cosine and
	Internet Schema	are supported. Object class and	attribute
	definitions are	enforced. Users	may define their own.

      *	Simple authentication is provided  strong authentication and
	signed operations have been tested operationally through Telis's
	participation in PASSWORD, a VALUE project with	aim to pilot a
	European security infrastructure for network applications.

      *	Access control : the DSA offers	a mechanism defined by Telis
	that is	functionally equivalent	to a profile of	the X500 '93
	access control mechanism. The mechanism	is based on the	notion
	of administrative domains (autonomous and semi-autonomous). A
	domain defines the user	groups (categories) and	their access
	rights (consult, modify) to specified attribute	types. The
	access rights are defined in prescriptive and entry ACI
	attributes.

      *	Phonetic searches : administrators may specify a language
	(English, French, ...) for a subtree of	the DIT. Approximate
	(phonetic) searches will then be carried out in	the given
	language. The software loads a rule database to	which new
	languages and new rules	may be added easily.

      *	Management: a Forum LOOK'UP DSA	object has been	defined	to allow
	operational parameters of the DSA to be	managed	via DAP. Forum
	LOOK'UP	conforms to X.500 (88) as specified in poaragraph 9 of
	X.519 Administration tools are provided	:

	 * to generate usage statistics	automatically and distribute
	   these by mail to administrators

	 * to replicate	subtrees of the	DIT to other FORUM LOOK'UP DSAs
	   and automatically update shadow copies,

	 * to extract hardcopy listings	from the database in an	Excel
	   compatible format for "paper" directories, all the management
	   tasks are performed through a GUI (X/Motif).

      *	The GUI	includes a "dashboard" for monitoring of servers and the
	hardware they are installed on.






Apple, Rossen						       [Page 94]

INTERNET-DRAFT		   FORUM LOOK'UP(tm)		    23 June 1996


      *	The DUAs include a graphical directory browser with powerful
	search functionality for PCs and Macintosh.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

Forum LOOK'UP conforms to X.500	(88) as	specified in paragraph 9 of
X.519

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

DSA connectivity to the	PARADISE pilot.

BUGS

Forum LOOK'UP is a commercial product. As such,	it is supported	and bugs
are fixed when detected.  Bug reports can be sent to our support team
via electronic mail.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS


      *	The DIT	structure and inverted attribute tables	are stored in
	main memory.

      *	The recommended	main memory size for a DSA is 1	kb per node,
	i.e., 10 Mb for	a database of 10,000 objects.






Apple, Rossen						       [Page 95]

INTERNET-DRAFT		   FORUM LOOK'UP(tm)		    23 June 1996


      *	The current recommended	maximum	for the	proprietary database
	(based on the Unix file	system)	is a database size of the order
	of 100,000 objects.

      *	For a larger database one unique server	(up to 300,000 objects),
	the use	of the Oracle database is recommended

      *	Of the selected	attribute types	defined	in X.500 (88), the
	searchGuide attribute is not supported

      *	neither	are the	following attributes from the Cosine and
	Internet Schema	(RFC 1274): OtherMailbox, MailPreferenceOption
	and the	various	quality	attributes.

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

Forum LOOK'UP includes a transport stack for TP0 with TCP/IP (RFC 1006)
and X.25. The stack has	been ported to SunNet OSI for TP4 with CLNP.

DUAs on	a LAN (Novell Netware, Microsoft Lan Manager, IBM Lan Server)
can access the DSA without the need for	IP on every Workstation. A
module (called SOLO server) available on Novell, OS/2 and UNIX allows to
have an	IP or X.25 stack only on the file server. It is	in charge of
forwarding the request to a DSA.

A direct access	(DUA / DSA) through IP,	X.25, PSTN or ISDN is also
available.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

Forum LOOK'UP can easily be ported to any UNIX machine.

It currently runs on: Sun Solaris and Hewlett Packard.

A port on IBM AIX is to	be completed.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

The Forum LOOK'UP server is portable to	any UNIX-like operating	system.
X/Motif	is the interface used for management.

The DUAs are available on Windows and Macintosh.

ORACLE V7 can be used as a database (option).

INTERNET-DRAFT			 FX*500			    23 June 1996


NAME

FX*500
Firefox	International Limited

ABSTRACT

FX*500 is a core component of Firefoxs product suite for mail,
messaging and directories.

FX*500 provides	a Directory System Agent (DSA) which adheres to	the
latest 1993 X.500 standards.

FX*500 may be used in conjunction with the Firefox FX*400 messaging
products or may	be combined with a range of Directory User Agent and
Gateway	products in order to satisfy a broad range of directory
requirements.

FX*500 affords unique integration opportunities	with Novell's NetWare
Directory Service (NDS)	by offering the	option of true dynamic directory
integration between NDS	and X.500.

FX*500 provides	support	for key	features of the	X.500 1993 standard
while continuing to support interworking with 1988 based directory user
agents and system agents. The main 1993	features of X.500 supported by
FX*500 are:


      *	Basic Access Control

      *	The 1993 DSA Information Model

      *	Replication and	Shadowing

In summary, FX*500 supports:


      *	1988 and 1993 X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP)

      *	1988 and 1993 X.500 Directory System Protocol (DSP)

      *	1993 X.500 Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP)

      *	1993 Basic (or Simplified) Access Control






Apple, Rossen						       [Page 98]

INTERNET-DRAFT			 FX*500			    23 June 1996


      *	the Lightweight	Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), as defined by
	RFC 1777

      *	configuration of knowledge information for distributed operation
	using 1993 operational attributes

      *	local management services, including a knowledge configuration
	application and	extensive diagnostic facilities

      *	an extended set	of management applications

      *	operation in a wide variety of network environments including
	connectivity over X.25,	TCP/IP (RFC 1006) and OSI LANs.

      *	an application developer's toolkit

The optional application developer's toolkit includes:


      *	the X/Open Directory Services (XDS) API	to support directory
	user agent applications

      *	a Gateway (G-XDS) API which is based on	a simplified version of
	the XDS	API syntax and allows developers to implement gateways
	to existing/ proprietary directory databases

      *	a Network Management Interface (NMI) to	support	management
	applications and integration with management services.

FX*500 is delivered with a schema defined to support the Common	Use and
MHS (X.402) Schemas defined by UK GOSIP	V4. The	subschema for FX*500 can
be modified by the customer and	updated	dynamically.

FX*500 provides	for search optimisation	by supporting keyed search
whereby	specific attributes can	be identified as 'keyed' through local
configuration data. This optimisation avoids the need to do a "brute
force" search which requires a traversal of all	the nodes of a subtree.
Approximate match search filters are also supported by using a phonetic
search based on	the "Soundex" algorithm.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

FX*500 meets both the static and dynamic requirements implied by section
9.2 of X.519 1988.

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

FX*500 utilises	the Firefox FX*STACK product to	provide	an OSI stack for
use over local or wide-area networks.  This enables the	X.500 DAP, DSP
and DISP protocols operate over	a range	of different network types. The
current	network	options	are:


      *	OSI LANs are supported by Transport Class 4 over CLNP (ISO
	8473), including the ES-IS routing protocol.

      *	X.25 networks are supported in either a	Connection-Oriented
	Network	Service	(CONS) or a Connection-Less Network Service
	(CLNS) environment.


	 * For CONS, Transport Classes 0, 2 and	4 are supported	over
	   X.25(1984).

	 * For CLNS, Transport Class 4 is supported over CLNP (ISO 8473)
	   utilising X.25 as a subnetwork.

      *	TCP/IP networks	are supported by an implementation of RFC 1006,
	which supports Transport Class 0 over TCP/IP.

INTERNET-DRAFT	ISODE Consortium Release 3.0 X.500(1993)    23 June 1996


NAME

   ISODE Consortium Release 3.0	X.500(1993) Directory
   ISODE Consortium Ltd.

ABSTRACT

   This	implementation is a source release of an X.500(1993) Directory
   System Agent	(DSA).	It has been designed an	implemented as an X.500
   1993	DSA  not as a 1988 DSA with '93	extensions.  Emphasis has been
   placed on providing support for a flexible information model, access
   control, X.509 security features, and standard replication.

   The 1993 DSA	offers a strong	technical foundation on	which to build
   an information and messaging	infrastructure that relies on robust and
   scalable directory services.	 The implementation of this DSA
   incorporates	the experience gained through the development, support,
   and maintenance of the earlier QUIPU, as well as operational
   experience and standards support.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory
   Implementors	Guide Version 1. X.500(1993) features such as
   replication,	access control,	as well	as X.509 certification are also
   available.  Interoperability	testing	with other DSAs	has been
   performed.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   Please contact the ISODE Consortium if you wish to obtain our
   protocol information	conformance statements.	PICS may also be
   available from member organizations for their binary	products.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Interoperability with several other DSAs has	been demonstrated in
   pilot operation and at Eurosinet in October 1995.

   At Eurosinet, X.500 interoperability	testing	used the X.500 DAP
   (Directory Access) and DSP (Directory System) protocols. Successful
   testing was done between the	ISODE Consortium X.500(1993) DSA and
   DSAs	from four other	vendors	including Siemens-Nixdorf and Bull. The
   ISODE Consortium was	the only vendor	to bring an X.500(93) compliant
   DSA to the workshop for the scheduled X.500(93) testing.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Connectivity	to the global research pilots (PARADISE	etc.) has been
   demonstrated. It is expected	that this system will be used
   extensively in a wide range of pilot	activities.  DUA Connectivity,
   and DSA Connectivity.

BUGS

   Bugs	should be reported to the ISODE	Consortium via email.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   The IC R3.0 release is application level code, and assumes vendor
   provided lower layers. It provides the following modules with support
   for a range of APIs to handle associated lower layers:


	 * RFC 1006 (vendor supplied TCP/IP using sockets or TLI)

	 * Transport service (vendor supplied transport, which may be
	   any class and use any network service. TLI, XTI and various
	   vendor-specific APIs).

INTERNET-DRAFT			  LDAP			    23 June 1996


NAME

   LDAP

   University of Michigan

ABSTRACT

   UM-LDAP is an implementation	of the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol. LDAP is a draft Internet standard directory service
   protocol that runs over TCP/IP. It can be used to provide a stand-
   alone directory service, or to provide lightweight access to	the
   X.500 directory.  LDAP is defined by	RFC 1777 and RFC 1778.

   The UM-LDAP package includes	the following components:

	 * slapd - a stand-alone LDAP directory	server

	 * slurpd - a stand-alone LDAP replication server

	 * ldapd - an LDAP-to-X.500 gateway server

	 * centipede - an LDAP centroid	generation and maintenance
	   program

	 * libldap - an	LDAP client library

	 * liblber - a lightweight BER/DER encoding/decoding library

	 * ldif	tools -	data conversion	tools for use with slapd

	 * in.xfingerd - a finger-to-LDAP gateway server

	 * go500 - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching

	 * go500gw - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching and
	   browsing

	 * rcpt500 - an	email-to-LDAP query responder

	 * mail500 - an	LDAP-capable mailer

	 * fax500 - an LDAP-capable mailer that	supports remote	printing

	 * LDAP	tools -	A collection of	shell-based LDAP utility
	   programs




Apple, Rossen						      [Page 119]

INTERNET-DRAFT			  LDAP			    23 June 1996


   In addition,	there are some contributed components:


	 * web500 - an HTTP-to-LDAP gateway

	 * whois++d - a	WHOIS++-to-LDAP	gateway

	 * saucer - a simple command-line oriented client program


   The latest information about	LDAP can always	be found on the	LDAP
   Home	Page at	this URL:

      http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   The U-M LDAP	distribution is	a complete implementation of the LDAP
   protocol.  The LDAP protocol	does not support access	to all X.500
   features and	operations.  The operations supported are bind,	search,
   compare, add, delete, modify, modify	RDN, and abandon.  Note	that
   read	and list operations can	be emulated using the search operation.
   Size	and time limits	may be specified, as may alias dereferencing and
   searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   Since the LDAP protocol itself has not yet been updated to support
   any 1993-specific X.500 features, this implementation does support
   any 1993 features yet either.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Believed to be compliant with:

      RFC-1274:	"The COSINE and	Internet X.500 Schema"
      RFC-1777:	"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"
      RFC-1778:	"The String Representation of Standard Attribute

INTERNET-DRAFT			maX.500			    23 June 1996


NAME

   maX.500 :: Macintosh	DUA Interface

   University of Michigan

ABSTRACT

   maX.500 is a	Directory User Agent (client) for Apple	Macintosh.  It
   is widely used within Paradise and other Internet X.500 pilots.
   maX.500 supports searching, browsing, and modifying directory
   entries.  Display of	textual	information, playing of	audio, and
   viewing of both black-and-white (fax) and color (JPEG) images are
   supported.  Communication with directory servers is via the
   Lightweight Directory Access	Protocol (LDAP)	over TCP/IP.  maX.500
   works both with standalone LDAP directory servers (such as slapd) and
   with	X.500-backended	LDAP servers (such as ldapd).

   maX.500 is a	native Macintosh application, and has a	friendly
   interface.  It requires System Software version 6.0.5 or later and
   Apple's MacTCP or Open Transport TCP/IP networking.	The current
   version of maX.500 is 2.0.2,	although version 2.1 is	in beta	test.

   The latest information about	maX.500	can always be found on the
   maX.500 Home	Page at	this URL:
   http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/max500/

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   maX.500 works over LDAP, and	is subject to LDAP's limitations.  The
   bind, search, compare, add, delete, abandon,	modify,	and modifyrdn
   operations are all used by maX.500.	Size and time limits may be
   specified, as may alias dereferencing control.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   maX.500 currently uses LDAP as defined in RFC-1777, which does not
   support any 1993-specific X.500 features.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Believed to be compliant with:








Apple, Rossen						      [Page 123]

INTERNET-DRAFT			maX.500			    23 June 1996



	     RFC-1274: "The COSINE and Internet	X.500 Schema"
	     RFC-1777: "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"
	     RFC-1778: "The String Representation of Standard Attribute	Syntaxes"
	     RFC-1779: "A String Representation	of Distinguished Names"
	     RFC-1781: "Using the OSI Directory	to Achieve User	Friendly Naming"


CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL	RFCs

   Search filters comply with RFC-1558:	"A String Representation of LDAP
   Search Filters."  Uses the LDAP API,	as defined in RFC-1823.

INTEROPERABILITY

   maX.500 is known to work with the U-M LDAP servers (ldapd and slapd).
   It has also been tested with	other commerical LDAP servers, such as
   Control Data's server.  maX.500 has been used with a	wide variety of
   DSAs	(always	through	an LDAP	server).

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots.

BUGS

   Bug reports should be sent to max500-bugs@umich.edu.

CAVEATS	AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   maX.500 does	not support modification of "photo" (fax), "jpegPhoto",
   or "audio" attributes.  Versions of maX.500 before 2.1 did not
   support a fully functional browse facility.

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   maX.500 is an LDAP client, and as such is uses TCP to communicate
   with	the  LDAP server.  Apple's MacTCP control panel	or Open
   Transport TCP/IP networking is required.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   maX.500 runs	on Apple Macintosh Plus	or later Macintosh computers,
   including PowerMacs.	 It requires 600K of free RAM.






Apple, Rossen						      [Page 124]

INTERNET-DRAFT			maX.500			    23 June 1996


SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   maX.500 requires Apple System Software 6.0.5	or later (System 7
   preferred) and MacTCP 1.1 or	later (2.0.6 preferred).  maX.500 2.1,
   which is currently in beta test, will run natively on the PowerMac
   and use the native Open Transport networking	interface if it	is
   installed.

INTERNET-DRAFT		       PMDF-X500		    23 June 1996


NAME

   PMDF-X500

   from:

   Innosoft International, Inc.	 1050 East Garvey Ave. South West
   Covina, California  91790

   Phone:  +1 818-919-3600 email: sales@innosoft.com

ABSTRACT

   PMDF-X500 is	Innosoft's implementation of the X.500 standards for
   Directory Services. PMDF-X500 is based upon the ISODE Consortium
   code-base. The core of PMDF-X500 is the Directory System Agent (DSA)
   server. This	server provides	directory information to Directory User
   Agents (DUA)	using either OSI or TCP/IP networking protocols. Since
   PMDF-X500 is	based on a widely used implementation, it interoperates
   particularly	well with a whole host of X.500-based products from
   other sources.

   In order to facilitate initial loading of directory data as well as
   ongoing coordination	with other directory services, PMDF-X500
   includes tools to import from and export directory information to
   Entry Description File (EDF)	files.	EDF files are flat text	files.
   PMDF-X500 provides directory	coordination functions using EDF files
   for the following directories:


	 * X.500 DSAs supporting LDAP access

	 * cc:Mail

	 * Digital's DDS

	 * GroupWise

	 * Microsoft Mail

	 * PMDF	generic	databases

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   OSI directory services as specified in CCITT	X.500 Recommendations
   and ISO 9594	use the	Directory Access Protocol (DAP)	and the

   Directory System Protocol (DSP).

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1993 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

   PMDF-X500 does not yet support the 1993 changes to the X.500
   standard.  Support for the 1993 X.500 recommendations is planned for
   a future release of PMDF-X500.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   PMDF-X500 supports DAP and DSP accesses using Internet protocols as
   specified in	RFC 1006. In addition, the Internet community has
   proposed two	lightweight alternatives to DAP	called Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is specified	in RFC1777, and
   Connectionless Lightweight Directory	Access Protocol	(CLDAP), which
   is specified	in RFC1798.  LDAP and CLDAP, which are currently
   specified to	run over TCP/IP, are much simpler protocols than DAP and
   were	designed to reduce the cost of entry associated	with using X.500
   protocols in	client applications. PMDF-X500 includes	both LDAP and
   CLDAP servers.

   The LDAP server accesses X.500 directory information	using DAP to
   communicate with X.500  DSAs. PMDF-X500 provides an LDAP server which
   translates LDAP requests into DAP requests to communicate with X.500
   DSAs. CLDAP defines a very low overhead method for accessing	X.500
   directory information. CLDAP	is suitable for	providing access to
   information that does not require access controls.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL	RFCs

   [No information provided. --	Ed.]

INTEROPERABILITY

   PMDF-X500 interoperates with	a large	number of DUAs and DSAs. This is
   demonstated by the fact that	PMDF-X500 is DSA used by several
   Internet White Pages	Project	participants. PMDF-X500	DSA
   interoperability includes at	least all of the DSA that are used in
   the White Pages Project.

   PMDF-X500 is	delivered with several DUAs and	in addition is know to
   support the DUAs from Unisys	and Digital Equipment Corporation as
   well	as the publically available DUAs MaX500, Cello,	Swix, and the
   NASA	DUA.

INTERNETWORKING	ENVIRONMENT

   DAP and DSP are layered on top of the OSI protocol suite. PMDF-X500
   supports this protocol suite	over multiple network transports. For a
   pure	OSI protocol stack, DECnet/OSI can be used to provide the lower
   layers of the stack.	 In addition, PMDF-X500	supports running OSI
   upper layer protocols over a	TCP/IP transport in accordance with
   RFC1006. It is important to note that while RFC1006 specifies TCP/IP
   as a	transport, all of the OSI upper	layer protocols	are always used
   with	DAP and	DSP.

ABSTRACT

   waX.500 :: Windows Access to	X.500

   waX.500 is a	(currently 16-bit) DUA that run	on Microsoft Windows
   (3.1, Win95,	& WinNT).  It uses libldap.dll which uses the winsock
   (v1.1) interface.  It works on any vendors tcp/ip stack that	I've
   seen	so far (some configuration may be required).

   waX.500 was developed by the	University of Michigan for use by its
   faculty, staff and students.	 UM's online directory is an X.500
   directory containing	50,000+	entries.

INTERNET-DRAFT		  X.500-DS, X.500-DUA		    23 June 1996


NAME

X500-DS

X500-DUA

Bull S.A.

ABSTRACT

X500-DS	and X500-DUA are integral part of the large Bull OSI offer.
Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing Environment/Global
Directory Service) of OSF, those two products may be installed and used
without	the DCE	environment. Some enhancements have been added for the
user and the management	facilities.  X500-DS is	designed to implement
both the DUA and the DSA functions, whilst X500-DUA only provides the
DUA functions.

The X500-DUA package contains:


      *	The standards APIs XOM (X/Open OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation
	API) and XDS (X/Open Directory Service API) for	the development
	of portable applications,

      *	A core DUA to translate	all user's requests (bind, read, list,
	compare, modify, modifyRDN, search, add, remove, unbind	...)
	into the DAP protocol used for communication with distant DSAs,

      *	The OSI	standard high layers (ASN.1, ROSE, ACSE, Presentation
	and Session) for communication with the	distant	DSAs. The
	interface with the low layers is XTI. RFC-1006 is supported
	under XTI or the OSI Session,

      *	A DUA Cache to improve performances when accessing remote DSAs,

      *	A powerful management application facilitating the configuration
	of the product and controlling the operations, logs and	traces,

      *	A user application for the manipulations of the	database
	entries,

      *	A generic tool to load and unload ASCII	and binary files in/from
	distributed DSAs,

      *	The support of the LDAP	(RFC 1777) thanks to an	LDAP Server,

      *	A DUA Server that allows to use	A-Window-To-Directory (refer to
	this DUA product description) on a PC.

The X500-DS package contains:


      *	All components of the X500-DUA,

      *	A core DSA to process all requests received from distant DUAs
	through	DAP protocol or	from distant DSAs through DSP protocol,

      *	The support of the referral, chained and multi-casting modes of
	operation, access control lists	and management of knowledge
	information (for distribution, shadows and copies of sub-trees),

      *	The support of the simple authentication and of	the DCE
	authentication,

      *	A management application for managing the schema information
	(creation, deletion and	modification of	object classes and of
	attribute types, management of the rules of the	DIT).

      *	A C-ISAM database that is specially designed for high
	performances: e.g. less	than 10	ms to read an entry on an Escala
	at the XOM/XDS interface.

These two products are easely installed, configured and	administered
thanks to the System Management	Interface Tool (SMIT) screens of AIX.

COMPLIANCE with	X.500-1988 (applicable only for	DSAs and DUAs)

Compliant with EWOS and	OIW Agreements

Consists of both DUA and DSA implementation according to the '88 CCITT
X.500 and ISO 9594 standard. The X/Open	standard XDS and XOM interface
libraries are also provided. When the product is installed with	the DCE
environment, XDS and XOM interfaces are	also used to access DCE/CDS
(Local Cell Directory Service) transparently. A	GDA (Global Directory
Agent) serves then as the gateway between the DCE CDS and GDS.
