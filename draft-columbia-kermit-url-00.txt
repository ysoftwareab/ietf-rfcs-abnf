                          THE KERMIT URL SCHEME

STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress".

ABSTRACT

   This document defines the Kermit URL according to the rules of
   RFC 2717.

1. URL SCHEME NAME

   The scheme name is "kermit".

2. URL SCHEME SYNTAX

   The Kermit URL scheme is used to fetch files from Internet hosts
   using the Kermit protocol [1].

   Kermit URLs follow the common Internet scheme syntax described in
   Section 3.1 of RFC 1738 [2]. If ":<port>" is omitted, the port
   defaults to 1649 (as registered by IANA).  A username and password
   may be included.  If none is included, anonymous access as is used,
   exactly as in FTP.   Examples:

   Anonymous retrieval of a file:
     kermit://kermit.columbia.edu/READ.ME

   Authenticated retrieval of a file:
     kermit://olga:secret@xyzcorp.com/somepath/oofa.txt

   Authenticated retrieval of multiple files:
     kermit://olga:secret@xyzcorp.com/somepath/*.[ch]

   Secure authenticated retrieval of a file:
     kermit://olga@xyzcorp.com/somepath/oofa.txt

   In the latter case, authentication is performed by whatever security
   scheme the server and client negotiate [1].

3. CHARACTER ENCODING CONSIDERATIONS

   File and pathnames may be US ASCII (ISO 646 International Reference
   Version) or UTF-8.  UTF-8 names are converted into the native character
   set of the server.  For text-mode transfers, file record format and
   character set are converted according to normal Kermit rules and
   procedures.

4. INTENDED USAGE

   The specified file or files are retrieved from the host using Kermit
   protocol.  Text files are sent in text mode, binary files in binary
   mode, as determined automatically by the server.

5. INTEROPERABILITY

   Any Telnet client that supports Kermit protocol and the Telnet KERMIT
   Option [3] may use the Internet Kermit Service.  Any such Telnet client
   that can accept URLs on the command line (such as C-Kermit and Kermit 95)
   can serve as users of or helper applications for kermit URLs.

6. SECURITY

   Refer to [1].  No new security issues are raised by the use of this URL.
