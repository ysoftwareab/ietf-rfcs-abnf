Abstract

    This memo describes a method of linking resource metadata
    to resource objects using HTTP headers or HTML hyperlinks.
    The method uses features which exist in HTTP/1.0 and HTML 2.0,
    namely the Link element, to reference metadata of arbitrary
    MIME type from resources of arbitrary MIME type.

1.  Introduction

    Resources of various types may have metadata associated with them.
    Where this metadata, and often the resources, are available on
    the World-Wide Web, resource discovery and indexing may be 
    performed by automated agents which traverse hyperlinks between
    Web objects. In cases where the resource or the metadata do not 
    support hyperlinks, links in the HTTP protocol header may be used
    in place of links in the body. Examples of such resources include
    JPEG images and PDF documents. 

    This memo describes a method which may be used with existing 
    servers and software, and is readily available to most Web authors.
    It is not intended to take the place of structured metadata
    support currently in development for deployment with future
    versions of HTTP, but may co-exist in many cases
    with such support. It may be used where legacy metadata is defined
    in ASCII or binary format but no crosswalk or encapsulation method
    has been defined to convert to new structured types.

1.1 Terminology

    A forward metadata link is from a resource to its metadata, and
    is indicated by a REL relationship.

    A reverse metadata link is from metadata to the described resource,
    and is indicated by a REV relationship.

    A metadata scheme is a recognized method of describing and 
    formatting metadata, such as Dublin Core, FGDC geographic 
    metadata, MCF etc.

    If no scheme is specified, the metadata is assumed to follow
    common HTML practice (the resource is described in HTML, with
    optional Keywords and Description META tags, and may be indexed 
    using full-text techniques).
    
2.  Application

2.1 HTTP transport

    Where a resource is available by HTTP transport, a 
    forward link may be used to indicate the URI of corresponding
    metadata:

    "Link" ":" "<" URI ">" ";" "rel" "=" "meta" *( ";" 
      "scheme" "=" scheme )

    Where metadata is available by HTTP transport, a
    reverse link may be used to indicate the URI of the
    corresponding resource:

    "Link" ":" "<" URI ">" ";" "rev" "=" "meta" *( ";" 
      "scheme" "=" scheme )

    Examples of usage include:

    Link: <http://vancouver-webpages.com/ml/ch4.1.2.gif>; 
      rev="META"; scheme="DC"
    Link: <http://vancouver-webpages.com/ml/ch4.1.2.H.html>; rel="META"
    Link: <http://vancouver-webpages.com/ml/ch4.1.2.sgml>; 
      rel="META"; scheme="FGDC"

2.2 HTML encoding

    Where a resource is available in HTML, a forward link in the 
    document head may be used to indicate the URI of corresponding 
    metadata:

    "<" "LINK" *( "SCHEME" "=" scheme) "REL" "=" "META" 
      "HREF" "=" URI ">"

<draft-daviel-metadata-link-00.txt>                          3

    A forward anchor construct may be used in the document body 
    where a visible link is required:

    "<" "A" *( "SCHEME" "=" scheme) "REL" "=" "META" "HREF" "=" URI ">" 
       label "</A>"

    Where metadata is available in HTML, a reverse link may 
    be used to indicate the URI of the corresponding resource:

    "<" "LINK" *( "SCHEME" "=" scheme) "REV" "=" "META" 
      "HREF" "=" URI ">"
 
    A reverse anchor construct may be used in the document body
    where a visible link is required:

    "<" "A" *( "SCHEME" "=" scheme) "REV" "=" "META" "HREF" "=" URI ">"
       label "</A>"

    Examples of usage include:

    <LINK REL=META HREF="/ml/ch4.1.2.H.html">
    <LINK SCHEME=FGDC REL=META 
      HREF="http://vancouver-webpages.com/ml/ch4.1.2.sgml">
    <A REV=META HREF="http://vancouver-webpages.com/ml/ch4.1.2.gif">
      Barkley Sound</A>
    <LINK REV=META SCHEME=DC href="ch4.1.2.gif">

2.3  Resource Indexing

    If a reverse metadata link is present in a document head, 
    document body or HTTP header, the URI indexed by a discovery 
    agent should be that of the resource, not that of the 
    metadata.

2.3.1 Link Priority

    Multiple metadata links using the same scheme are deprecated.
    Where multiple metadata links using the same scheme are present,
    only one link should be used by a discovery agent. HTTP headers 
    should be given a higher priority than HTML link and 
    anchor elements.

    If a metadata link is present in the HTTP header of an object, the
    body may be ignored, so that an HTTP HEAD request may be used.
    Therefore if any metadata link is present in the HTTP header, all
    links using alternative schemes must also be present.

2.3.2 Metadata Spoofing

    In order to minimize the possibility of metadata spoofing 
    ( one organization supplying misleading metadata for a resource
    belonging to another organization), the forward relationship
    should have priority over the reverse relationship. 

    Therefore, if a document defining a reverse relationship is 
    traversed, a request should  immediately be made for the 
    resource and any forward link traversed in turn to discover 
    definitive metadata for the resource. 

    If any metadata exists for a resource defined by a 
    forward relationship, metadata defined only by a reverse 
    relationship should be considered invalid for all schemes.
    For example, Dublin Core metadata defined with both forward and
    reverse links invalidates MCF metadata defined with only a
    reverse link. If the author has the ability to add a forward
    link for one scheme, they are assumed to have that ability for
    all schemes.

    If no forward metadata links exist, multiple reverse metadata
    links may optionally be resolved in favour of the link most
    closely matching the host and path of the resource URI.

    These requirements reflect the fact that in many situations
    an author currently has control only over HTML documents,
    and has limited access to HTTP server features.

2.3.3 Offline Resources

    Where a resource is not available online, a null URI may be used
    in the reverse link to so indicate. Resources such as paper maps
    or audio CDs may thus be indexed by means of online metadata.
    The metadata scheme used may indicate the physical availability
    and format of the resource.

    Example: <LINK SCHEME=DC REV=META HREF="">
    
    (Such a provision may seem to be pointless, but it would 
    enable a search for a book by ISBN where it is clear
    to the agent that the object itself is offline, and
    conversely allow a search for online objects only if
    desired.)
