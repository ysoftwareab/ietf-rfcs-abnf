Abstract

   File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) is defined in RFC
   3926 and provide an extensible framework for delivering any type of
   files over UDP.  FLUTE is mostly intended for IP multicast
   comminication, but the use with IP unicast is not excluded.  Real-
   time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) allow the play-out of media packets to
   multicast and unicast sessions.

Internet-Draft    Controlling FLUTE sessions with RTSP         June 2006


1.  Introduction

   File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) is defined in RFC
   3926 [RFC3926] and provide an extensible framework for delivering any
   type of files over UDP.  FLUTE is primarily intended for multicast
   communication, but not restricted to it. 3GPP Multimedia Broadcast
   and Multicast Service (MBMS) [3GPP.26.346], and Open Mobile Allicance
   (OMA) BAC BCAST specifications [OMA-BCAST]) supports the usage of
   FLUTE sessions in combination with RTP sessions.  On important use-
   case of FLUTE transmissions simultaneously to RTP transmissions are
   voting and general interactivity services for Mobile TV applications.
   OMA BAC BCAST defines so-called InteractivityMedia documents, which
   may be transmitted simultaneously with RTP sessions using FLUTE.  OMA
   BAC BCAST [OMA-BCAST] also allows the usage of FLUTE on unicast IP
   sessions.

   To efficiently use RTSP for OMA BAC BCAST enabled multicast server
   control, a FLUTE session establishment needs to be added in RTSP.
   RTSP already allows to control the playback of content into a
   multicast group.  Therefore, it is natural to extend RTSP to control
   also FLUTE sessions.

   This internet-draft proposes the definition of a FLUTE session
   establishment and control with RTSP.  A FLUTE enabled streaming
   server can be then controlled using the RTSP protocol to playback a
   predefined session onto a multicast address.  Note, that MPEG is
   currently defining FLUTE hint-tracks for the ISO file format.  This
   will simplify even the playback of strored sessions.  This internet
   draft also defines the FLUTE session establishment for unicast
   communication.  A client can use RTSP to establish a FLUTE unicast
   session between itself and the server.


2.  Use Cases

   This section describes three use cases for FLUTE play-out control by
   RTSP.  The use-cases here are alined to the use-cases described in
   RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

2.1.  On-demand Playback using Multicast

   It is possible to use RTSP to request that media is delivered to a
   multicast group.  FLUTE may be used together with a multicast
   session, since it was primarily designed for File-delivery over
   multicast IP session.  The content may be pre-recorded or generated
   on the fly (live).

2.2.  Unicast distribution of Live and Stored content

   FLUTE is primarily designed for multicast transmissions.  However,
   the use on unicast is not restricted by FLUTE.  A live server may
   offer a session via multicast and also via unicast distribution.  In
   such a case, the same UDP payload may be transmitted towards the
   multicast session and the unicast on-demand sessions.  The streaming
   server however needs to be configured with the destination address
   and port.  In the unicast case the streaming server will need to
   adjust the IP and UDP headers of the flute packets for the
   distribution method.


3.  RTSP extensions

   This section first describe the general procedures of the FLUTE
   session configuration and then the necessary RTSP Method handling.

3.1.  General Procedure Description

   FLUTE [RFC3926] is a unidirectional file delivery protocol.  A file
   is partitioned into smaller chunks, which fit into UDP packets of
   predefined size.  The file properties, such as the file name, MIME
   type, etc are described in the FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT).  The
   FDT is send in-band in the FLUTE session and is identified by a well-
   defined value in the FLUTE packet header (i.e.  Transport Object
   Identifier is set to zero).  A FLUTE session may uilize several UDP
   ports simultaneously.  If more than one UDP port is required, this is
   indicated in the "flute-ch" attribute in the SDP.

3.2.  FLUTE specific SDP extensions

   he FLUTE specific SDP extensions are defined in [I-D.mehta-rmt-flute-
   sdp].  For the FLUTE session establishment using RTSP, a control URI
   as defined in RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis] SHALL be present
   for the FLUTE media description.  The control URI is used within the
   RTSP SETUP method to establish the described FLUTE sessions.

3.3.  RTSP Method Handling

3.3.1.  Session Set-up

   A control URI as defined in RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis]
   SHALL be present for each FLUTE media description in the SDP.  The
   control URI is used within the RTSP SETUP method to establish the
   described FLUTE sessions.

   If the "flute-ch" attribute is present for the FLUTE session, an

   according number of FLUTE sessions is established.

   The syntax for transport protocol specifiers in RTSP 2.0 transport
   header is defined as one or more tokens separated by a "/" (See ABNF
   in section 19.2.3 of RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   The RTSP transport protocol specifier for FLUTE SHALL be "FLUTE/UDP".
   One and only one UDP port is allocated for each FLUTE channel.

3.3.2.  RTSP PLAY method

   The PLAY method tells the server to start sending data including
   FLUTE session data as defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].  For
   "Live" session, the RTSP server forwards the FLUTE packets as they
   are received.  For stored sessions, it is expected that transmission
   timing information for the FLUTE packets are stored with the FLUTE
   session.

3.3.3.  RTSP PAUSE method

   The PAUSE request causes the stream delivery includeing all FLUTE
   sessions to be interrupted (halted) as defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-
   rfc2326bis].

3.3.4.  RTSP Teardown method

   The TEARDOWN client to server request stops the stream delivery
   including all FLUTE data delivery for the given URI, freeing the
   resources associated with it.  Details for the TEARDOWN method are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].


4.  Flute Data Considerations

   There are a few considerations need when implementing the support for
   controlling FLUTE sessions.

4.1.  Congestion Control

   When using this extension to deliver FLUTE packets over best-effort
   networks there is a need to monitor the congestion state of the path
   so that this transmission does not cause severe congestion or are
   significantly unfair against other flows.

   The method for accomplishing this is for future study.

Internet-Draft    Controlling FLUTE sessions with RTSP         June 2006


4.2.  Adaption of FLUTE data flow

   The FLUTE data flow may contain FEC data.  In these case the
   streaming server MAY adapt the flow to the known error properties of
   the path between the server and the client.  However the feasability
   of this is dependent on the FEC code in use.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The transport header protocol specifier: "FLUTE/UDP" will be registed
   with the IANA.  The registration will follow the rules defined in
   section 21.5 of RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].


6.  Security Considerations

   See [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis] for security considerations related
   to the Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

   There are some confidentiality and integrity issues with FLUTE
   sessions.  Please also see the security considerations in [I-D.ietf-
   rmt-flute-revised]and in [I-D.mehta-rmt-flute-sdp].

   There might be a need to confidentiality protect the file in a FLUTE
   session.  It is possible to use SMIME within FLUTE sessions.

   There is currently no approch to confidentiality and/or integrity
   protect the FLUTE FDT.  Malicious FLUTE FDT packets might detern a
   FLUTE client from receiving files.
