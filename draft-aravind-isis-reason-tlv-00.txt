1  Introduction

   Usually, during changes in topology or database info, a new LSP is
   generated by Intermediate Systems(IS) in ISIS. But currently, there
   are no mechanisms to showcase the reason for generation of new LSPs.
   The proposed Reason TLV could be viewed along the same lines as
   Dynamic Hostname TLVs [RFC5301]. These set of TLVs basically make the
   protocol more user-friendly and keeps its users well informed about
   the overall processing carried out by it. 

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Use-cases

2.1  Reduction in Processing overload at Receivers

   Currently, the Receiving Router has to parse through the entire
   content of received LSPs and compare with the existing LSPs in its
   Database to identify the newly updated changes. But with the proposed

   Reason TLVs, the receiver could get to know the exact set of TLVs
   that have been updated in received LSP and process only those set of
   TLVs. Hence, crucial decisions like running SPF calculations could be
   done more efficiently and with less processing overload. 


2.2  User Assistance

   With reason TLVs, the root-causes that triggered the specific LSP
   update could be notified by the networking vendors to Users (possibly
   with debugs/logs). Hence, this could greatly help in overall
   understandability of current behavior of protocol and can also help
   to reassure whether the required results had been achieved. 

   For E.g.: Consider an User configuring Overload bit in a Router.
   Under current scenarios, the user has to execute "show database
   command" at every Router in Domain (to view the LSP database) to
   reassure that the overload bit has been correctly sent out from
   originator and reflected properly in all other neighbor routers for
   the corresponding LSPs. But, if the User can view such info directly
   from LSP Update debugs at the originating and receiving ends,
   possible workloads could be avoided. The same applies to addition of
   new routes, change in protocol fields and so on.


2.3  Delaying/Dampening the actions based on Reason TLVs

   Depending upon the reasons that triggered the LSP Updates, the
   receivers can delay/postpone the corresponding actions thereby
   reducing unnecessary flooding/churns in network. 

   For E.g.: The IP-Internal/External Reachability TLVs basically
   provides the IP reachability info in ISIS. Hence, any
   addition/removal of such TLVs reflect the reachability status for
   such IP routes. Generally, IP routes may become unreachable either
   due to link down states or Admin operations. In case of Link Down
   states, it could be possible for link to reach the UP state in a 
   very short time. Hence, it may be useful if the receivers can delay
   the SPF runs to a small extent (providing a small time gap for the
   link to reach UP state again at originator). These decisions could be
   efficiently made using Reason TLVs. If the sender fills appropriate
   Reason Codes, the receiver can decipher such scenarios and provide a
   small cushion for the links in sender to reach UP state again. This
   can help greatly in avoiding unnecessary chaos in the Network due to
   sudden link flaps.

2.4  Easy  Debugging

   In case of buggy scenarios, debugging could be efficiently carried
   out with the help of Reason TLVs. 

   For E.g.: Consider a Router to be malfunctioning in an ISIS domain
   and starts generating LSPs unexpectedly. Under such scenarios, the
   Reason TLVs could provide the root-causes that trigger these
   unexpected LSP generations and could assist in problem analysis.

               Figure 1: Reason TLV

   Type: TBD. 
   Length: Total number of bytes contained in the value field.
   Value : TLVs that have undergone changes in LSP

   In addition to established TLV Codes (like Area Address, Protocols
   supported and so on), we could also introduce new TLV Codes for the
   attribute fields in LSP Header (Overload bit, Attached bit and
   Partition repair and so on). 

   Also, we could use Sub TLV types since we may need to distinguish
   between set/clear bits (say for overload bits, attached bits). And
   there could be one/more Sub-TLVs in a single Reason TLV.


3.1  Backward Compatibility

   Since the info is provided via a new TLV, the Routers which may not
   recognize this TLV could ignore it thereby maintaining backward
   compatibility with legacy systems and help in easier deployment.
