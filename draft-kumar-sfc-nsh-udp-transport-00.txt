            UDP Overlay Transport For Network Service Header
                  draft-kumar-sfc-nsh-udp-transport-00

Abstract

   This draft describes the transport encapsulation to carry Network
   Service Header (NSH) over UDP protocol.  This enables applications
   and services using NSH to communicate over a simple layer-3 network
   without topological constraints.  It brings down the barrier to
   implement overlay transports by not requiring additional overhead as
   is typical of overlay mechanisms designed on top of UDP.

   As a first benefit, this method eases the deployment of Service
   Function Chaining (SFC) by allowing SFC components to utilize the
   basic UDP/IP stack available in virtually all network elements and
   end systems to setup the overlays and realize SFCs.

1.  Introduction

   NSH is an encapsulation designed to carry SFC specific information
   and metadata.  It is very flexible in providing fixed and variable
   length encapsulation options while allowing for a high degree of
   extensibility.  NSH in addition allows for carrying a variety of
   packets as payload, there by being just a shim header between the
   inner payload and the outer transport.

   NSH focuses on the application aspect of the encapsulation while
   leaving the transport mechanisms out of scope.  This design choice

Internet-Draft              NSH UDP Transport                   May 2015


   allows NSH to be carried on any overlay transport as required by the
   application and the use cases.

   The transport independence aspect of NSH makes it necessary for
   existing transport protocols or new ones to carry NSH encapsulated
   packet as a payload.  Given that IP networks are ubiquitous with
   virtually every device, element, node connected to the IP network
   possessing the ability to support UDP datagram transport over IP
   layer, it is one of the most basic of the transports to carry NSH.

   UDP as a transport provides many benefits which has made it the de-
   facto choice for overlay networks such as VxLAN [RFC7348].  By nature
   it is a datagram service and trades reliability for simplicity and
   reduced overhead.  It allows for sufficient entropy, for the network
   to exploit, in load balancing packets across paths in the network.
   Likewise, end hosts exploit it to distribute packets between the NICs
   and processor cores, within, for optimum performance.  To this end,
   network elements and end hosts, both hardware and software, implement
   specific mechanisms to optimize UDP packet processing.

   UDP datagram service and efficient implementations of it in existing
   networks is thus a forgone conclusion.  These benefits among others,
   coupled with extensibility aspect of NSH - to implement security,
   header verification, etc., makes UDP a very simple, widely available
   and foundational choice for transporting NSH encapsulated packets.

   This draft describes the creation of on-demand point-to-point
   lightweight NSH overlays using UDP as the overlay transport
   mechanism.

3.  NSH UDP Overlay Transport

3.1.  Stacking And Layering

   A NSH encapsulated packet when carried over an UDP overlay transport
   looks as depicted in Figure 1.

   The original payload, L2 frame, L3 packet, NSH OAM message, etc., is
   first encapsulated in NSH shim header.  The NSH encapsulated packet
   then becomes the payload for the UDP packet carried over an IPv4 or
   IPv6 network.  The UDP header serves as the L4 overlay transport for
   NSH and its payload.

   Although depicted as a layer3 IP over an L2 network, nothing is
   assumed about how the L3 network is designed and deployed.  It is
   entirely possible for IPinIP or MPLS or other underpinnings.

3.3.  Overlay Transport End-points

   The UDP overlay transport extends between the two end-points involved
   in carrying the NSH overlay traffic.  The control plane provisioning
   the NSH overlay MUST specify the location of the overlay destination
   when using UDP transport overlay, such as the IPv4 or IPv6 address of
   the end-point.

Internet-Draft              NSH UDP Transport                   May 2015


   In the case of SFC, this UDP overlay transport extends between two
   SFC components: Classifier and SFF or SFFs or SFF and SF or SFF and
   SFC-proxy.  The destination of the UDP overlay transport is thus the
   IP address used by these components to receive the NSH overlay
   traffic.  When UDP overlay transport is required to carry NSH
   encapsulated traffic, SFC control plane MUST provision the UDP
   overlay transport destination and the use of UDP overlay transport.

3.4.  UDP Source Port Considerations

   The source port used in the UDP overlay transport SHOULD be computed
   to provide entropy for load balancing along the transmission path,
   including network elements such as routers and switches as well as
   end points such as servers.  This behavior may in turn be controlled
   by local-policy at the encapsulating entity.

   The source UDP port number SHOULD stay constant and not change for
   the flow represented within the NSH payload.  This is typically done
   by computing the source UDP port number as a hash over the invariant
   part of the NSH payload.  This could be IP and UDP or IP and TCP part
   of the NSH payload when the next-protocol field in NSH base header is
   set to IPv4, for instance.  This avoids inducing packet reordering
   due to the use of NSH UDP overlay transport.

   The recommended selection of source port as per [RFC6335], is the
   dynamic range: 49152-65535.  A number in this range SHOULD be
   selected to reflect the NSH payload.

3.5.  Checksum Considerations

   The checksum in the UDP header MAY be set to zero for performance or
   other implementation specific reasons by the entity encapsulating the
   NSH packet (classifier, SFF, SF-proxy or SF).  The receiving entity
   thus MUST accept a UDP encapsulated NSH packet with zero UDP
   checksum.

   Implementations MAY choose to use non-zero checksum values.  When a
   checksum other than zero is set by the encapsulating entity, it MUST
   be computed over the IP and UDP headers as defined in the UDP
   specification [RFC0768].  The receiving entity thus MUST accept a UDP
   encapsulated NSH packet with non-zero UDP checksum.  Receiving
   entities, of NSH UDP overlay packets with non-zero checksum, are
   RECOMMENDED to verify the checksum before accepting the packet.

3.6.  MTU Considerations

   Operators of networks deploying UDP overlay transport for NSH are
   RECOMMENDED to configure the MTU of the network to accommodate NSH
   and UDP transport encapsulation overhead.  This prevents
   fragmentation of UDP overlay transport encapsulated NSH packets and
   the overhead of processing such fragments both in the network and the
   end-points.

3.7.  Fragmentation Considerations

   Entities performing the UDP transport encapsulation MUST use the same
   source port number on all the fragments of the same packet when
   encapsulating pre-fragmented IP packets.

3.8.  UDP-Lite Considerations

   Exercising the option of setting the NSH UDP encapsulation checksum
   to zero, does not protect the NSH header from errors introduced into
   the header during transmission.  NSH provides extensibility for
   applications or future NSH extensions to build such bit error
   protection.

   Implementations that require protection against bit errors MAY use
   UDP-lite [RFC3828] with checksum coverage covering the NSH header.
   UDP-lite shares the UDP name space but uses the IP protocol
   identifier to distinguish itself from UDP.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to de-assign the well-known UDP port number 6633
   and re-assign it for the purpose defined in this draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   Encapsulating NSH in UDP does not alter the security risk of NSH
   encapsulation and payload.

   Security of the payload encapsulated by NSH is as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh]
