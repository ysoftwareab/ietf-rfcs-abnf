             Figure 1: Capabilities of NSFs in I2NSF Framework

   A use case of an NSF with the capabilities of firewall and web filter
   is described as follows.

   o  If a network manager wants to apply security policy rules to block
      malicious users with firewall and web filter, it is a tremendous
      burden for a network administrator to apply all of the needed
      rules to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by
      managing the capabilities of NSFs in this document.

   o  If a network administrator wants to block malicious users for IPv6
      traffic, he sends a security policy rule to block the users to the
      Network Operator Management System using the I2NSF User (i.e., web
      application).
   o  When the Network Operator Management System receives the security
      policy rule, it automatically sends that security policy rules to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer's Management System A
      and NSF-1 in Developer's Management System B) which can support
      the capabilities (i.e., IPv6).  This lets an I2NSF User not
      consider NSFs where the rule is applied.

   o  If NSFs encounter the suspicious IPv6 packets of malicious users,
      they can filter the packets out according to the configured
      security policy rule.  Therefore, the security policy rule against
      the malicious users' packets can be automatically applied to
      appropriate NSFs without human intervention.
