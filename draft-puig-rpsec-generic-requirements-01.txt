Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


1. Introduction

   Routing protocols are subject to threats and attacks that can harm
   individual users or the network as a whole [THREATS]. This document
   provides a description of basic security requirements for routing
   protocols and routing systems.

   This work is designed to serve as reference material for current
   routing protocols analysis, for extensions design, and as a guidance
   for designing new, more secure, routing protocols and routing
   systems.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   Information about security terms is provided in [SEC-GLOSS].

   In order to avoid confusion between user traffic forwarding and
   routing traffic forwarding, in this document the former is performed
   by ``forwarders'' and called ``forwarding'' while the latter is
   performed by ``relays'' and called ``relaying''.

   Additional terms are defined in acronyms section (Appendix A).

   This document is organized as follows:

   o  Section 2 presents general considerations relative to the security
      of routing protocols and routing systems, and routing protocols
      categories within scope.

   o  Some threats defined in [THREATS] can be mitigated, others can
      not. Section 3 is a rationale about threats elected for
      mitigation.

   o  Section 4 presents a routing functions overview.

   o  Section 5 presents an overview of routes descriptions.

   o  Actual routing protocols security requirements are defined in
      Section 6.

   o  Section 7 describes cryptographic considerations for routing
      operations.

   o  Section 8 provides considerations regarding active behaviors of
      routing devices in the overall security of the routing
      negotiations.

   o  Section 9 addresses problems related to local resource exhaustion.

   o  Section 10 introduces the inter-domain puzzle.

   o  Appendix B explains how threats elected in Section 3 are actually
      mitigated by requirements presented in Section 6.

   o  Appendix C gives examples.

   o  Appendix D is a summary of the requirements.

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


2. General Considerations

   This section provides general considerations on the design of secure
   routing protocols.

2.1 High Level Requirements

   [OLD] Distribution of destination reachability information with the
   required policy considerations (QoS, trusted route, etc.) is what is
   expected from a routing protocol.

   Routing protocols act as managers of a distributed database with very
   quick synchronization times. They are responsible for distributing
   information about reachability to destinations attached to the
   network, and the distribution of policies about the available paths.

   Reachability MUST be protected against unauthorized route deletions
   and route additions.  Note that these are high level operations;
   aggregation, for instance, may result in the same consequences as
   announcing new routes; so may the removal of some routing
   information, and the policies attending that routing information.

   Route attributes (path information, metrics, trusted entity for the
   forwarding of specific traffics) SHOULD also be protected.  From an
   attacker perspective, modifying attributes in order to achieve a
   precise goal may be more difficult than injecting an additional
   route.  Besides, routing protocols may benefit from protection of
   routes and lack of protection of route attributes.

   [TBD] We have to decide if route attributes require as much
   protection as route existence, probably yes.  Note that manipulation
   of routes associated attributes may achieve the same effects as those
   resulting from addition / deletion.  May be we should insert the
   final requirement decision in an appropriate section (likely,
   specific considerations to LSPs and DVPs).

2.2 Routing Protocols within Scope

   Currently, routing protocols addressed in this document are those
   limited by the rpsec WG charter. This includes distance vectors
   protocols and link-state protocols. We are also interested in the
   dedicated use of such protocols for intra-domain and inter-domain
   routing. Host-to-routers protocols are out of scope.

   [TBD] We may need to add some verbosity level off the above ?

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


3. Threats Mitigation Rationale

   This section describes which threats extracted from [THREATS] were
   considered in establishing these security requirements. Some threats
   were put aside because they were considered either not tractable or
   not worthing an additional performance / complexity trade-off.
   Knowledge of the limits of the requirements presented in this
   document is essential.

3.1 Threats Elected for Mitigation

   o  Spoofing should be mitigated, and this was considered. However,
      spoofing is closely tied to the concept of identity and this
      identity is often also an address.  Protection against address
      spoofing requires extra care.  [AH] may be seen as an instance of
      a protocol with built-in address spoofing protection.

   o  Falsification is one of the most significant threats against
      routing protocols. It is the main target of the requirements
      presented in this document.

   o  Interference is only partly tractable: protection against replay
      of out-dated packets, reaction to suspect slowdowns are possible.
      However, there is little to nothing that can be done against a
      subverted link or router which drop packets or receipts; only
      fail-back procedures / redundant paths are applicable here.

   o  Overload protection requires appropriate design of both the
      routing protocol and the routing device. Several sections of this
      document bring further information about resources consumption and
      exhaustion.

   o  Byzantine failure occurs when at least one authorized device get
      subverted. Thus, many threats are also Byzantine failures. The
      Byzantine general problem resolution is limited by hypotheses
      which are reminded in this document.


3.2 Threats Put Aside

   o  Deliberate Exposure, provided that it is NOT also a falsification,
      is put aside in this version of the document because it is
      currently unclear under which circumstances such a threat may
      happen and what is actually the value of the information exposed.
      Lastly, it seems that there is little that can be done against
      this.

   o  Sniffing is put aside because protection against it would involve



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


      additional resources requirements on routing devices and
      additional complexity, whether this would be built directly within
      the routing protocol or not. For this version of the document,
      authenticity and integrity of routing information got more concern
      than it's confidentiality (confidentiality is a MAY).

   o  Traffic Analysis protection is difficult to achieve and requires a
      general approach which cannot be limited to routing protocols
      only. Note that an effective protection against traffic analysis
      not only involves headers addresses camouflage, but also size and
      intermediate times scrambling.

   [TBD] Think about setting the confidentiality service as a MAY
   requirement; confidentiality thwarts partly interest of exposing /
   sniffing / analyzing traffic.

4. Routing Functions Overview

   [TBD] For the very moment, what you can find here is merely a cut and
   paste from the threat doc. The question is: do we really need this
   section ? if yes, should we add / change things in the following ? I
   suggest we start from this and specialize the description for
   specific classes of routing protocols.

   This section provides an overview of functions which can be found in
   various routing protocols. Following sections may refer to this
   description for the sake of an accurate description of some
   considerations.

   In general, routing protocols share the following functions:

   o  Transport Subsystem: The routing protocol transmits messages to
      its neighbors using some underlying protocol.  For example, OSPF
      uses IP, while other protocols may run over TCP.

   o  Neighbor State Maintenance: neighboring relationship formation is
      the first step for topology determination.  For this reason,
      routing protocols may need to maintain the state of their
      neighbors.  Each routing protocol may use a different mechanism
      for determining its neighbors in the routing topology.  Some
      protocols have distinct exchange through which they establish
      neighboring relationships, e.g., Hello exchanges in OSPF.

   o  Database Maintenance: Routing protocols exchange network topology
      and reachability information.  The routers collect this
      information in routing databases with varying detail.  The
      maintenance of these databases is a significant portion of the
      function of a routing protocol.

   A router's functions can be divided into control and data plane
   (protocol traffic vs. data traffic). In a similar fashion, a routing
   protocol has a control and a data plane.  A routing protocol has a
   control plane that exchanges messages that are intended only for
   control of the protocol state.

   Routing protocol data plane uses messages to exchange information
   that is intended to be used in the forwarding function. For example,
   the information can be used to establish a forwarding table in each
   router or to return a description of the route to be used.

   Routing functions may affect the control and the data planes.
   However, there may be an emphasis on one of the planes as opposed to
   the other.  For example, neighbor maintenance is likely to focus on
   the routing protocol control plane, while database maintenance may

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   focus on the data plane.

   [TBD] We should introduce the management plane somewhere !!!

4.1 Routing Protocols Components

   [TBD] Honestly, I doubt the following is useful. Comments are welcome
   on whether it actually is. If yes, we need advises on actual content.

4.1.1 IGP

   IGPs functions are summarized by the above statements. Database
   construction is achieved thanks to ``classical'' versions of route
   computation algorithms.

4.1.2 EGP

   Exterior gateway protocols historically embeds functional features
   related to Neighbor Reachability and Network Reachability. These are
   almost directly mapped to Neighbor State and Database Maintenance.
   Other common functions may include:

   o  Decision: the process through which local network reachability
      information is built from inbound updates received from peers.
      The decision function is more specific than a simple route
      computation algorithm in that it includes policies configuration
      expressed through the management plane.

   o  Coherence: a EGP may implement a specific mechanism in order to
      assert that external gateways from the same AS export coherent
      pieces of information.


4.1.3 Link State

   Link state protocols functions are achieved through periodic flooding
   on unicast or multicast addresses.

4.1.4 Distance Vectors

   Database Maintenance function of distance vectors protocols relies on
   distributed algorithms. Communication with neighbors is commonly
   achieved through broadcast.

4.1.5 Ad-Hoc

   Routing protocols for Ad-Hoc Networks implement very specific
   approaches of neighbors state and database maintenance. A significant

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   amount of topology knowledge may be acquired in a reactive fashion.
   Updates at both control plane level and data plane level may require
   either flooding on short periods or active demand.

   Routing decisions may eventually be the result of a heuristic on
   orthogonal requirements involving also QoS and power management.

   Sometimes, multiple path to the same destination are recorded in the
   database.

4.1.6 Multicast

   [TBD] Is-it really useful a section ? Why did we put it in the first
   place ?

   Multicast provides an alternate way to address neighbors. Group
   membership management relies on specific functions.

4.2 Routing Devices Components

   [TBD]

5. Routes Descriptions

   [TBD] The way routes are presented affects the overall security of
   the routing protocol. We should develop on this.  E.g. full path
   description vs next hop.

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


6. Security Requirements

6.1 Routing Control Plane

6.1.1 Adjacency

   Creation of an adjacency relation with a node SHOULD be completed
   with the evidence that the peer actually owns the identifier he uses.

   Protection of keep-alive messages against falsification and replay
   MUST be provided.

   [TBD] We need to develop on this !!!

6.1.2 The Byzantine Problem

   TBD: presentation of the pb [BYZANTINE].  cf. the threats doc.  Wait
   until new threats doc evolution.

   The following considerations should help in the design of a Byzantine
   resistant (either through detection or through robustness) routing
   protocol:

   o  Local instance of the protocol SHOULD NOT rely on correct
      operation of a particular neighbor, and SHOULD always apply least
      privilege.  Only traffic source and destination should be
      considered trustworthy.

   o  Messages MUST be authenticated when sent and checked for their
      authenticity when received.

   Note that detection and robustness properties are not necessarily
   correlated.

6.1.2.1 General Requirements

   TBD: explain here how hypothesis needed for tackling correctly the pb
   (synchronization, topology considerations...) may be mapped on the
   specific context of routing protocols.

   Classical hypothesis for Byzantine failure resolution are:

   o  devices are fully connected,

   o  the decision that must be agreed upon is binary (yes/no),

   o  the network is synchronous,




Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   o  strictly less than a third of the devices are faulty.

   Under these hypothesis, a distributed algorithm requires as many
   rounds as the number of faults to be tolerated plus one.

   Further information about distributed agreement can be found in
   [CONSENSUS].  In the following, we will only focus on what makes the
   problem tractable in IP networks.

   The ability to send messages to all participants simultaneously (c.f.
   Section 6.5) allow for simulation of both full connectivity and
   synchronization.  The fact that routing information is not a
   agreeable binary decision has little consequences because agreement
   is not an absolute requirement; see Section 6.1.2.4 and [BYZANTINE].

6.1.2.2 Detection of the Occurence of a Byzantine Failure

   The protocol algorithm may detect incoherences within the correlated
   routing information upon algorithm termination, abnormal attractive
   cycles within routes computations, etc. These events may be symptoms
   of a Byzantine failure occurring. More trivial evidences of a
   possible Byzantine failure is when agreement, termination or validity
   of the consensus cannot be achieved.

6.1.2.3 Byzantine Detection

   Byzantine detection is much more precise than just detecting a
   Byzantine failure and consist in the ability to find out which
   participants are subverted.  A part of inherent risk of Byzantine
   detection is that when the number of traitors grow past a limit, it
   may be difficult for a device to figure out which group is subverted.
   Sometimes, the considered device may be itself -or conclude it is
   itself- faulty.

   Automatic responses following a Byzantine detection MUST NOT prevent
   the subverted devices from participating again when they cease to
   behave incorrectly.  Forwarding options when dealing with a detected
   subverted device are forwarding along an alternate route if available
   (Detour), or forwarding anyway if not (Send & Hope).  If only a part
   of non faulty participants can achieve the detection then care should
   be taken that detection's responses do not deceive non-detector
   non-faulty devices (the former would appear faulty to the latter and
   the situation would get worse).  Simulating a link shutdown with a
   subverted device can be investigated. Collaborative approach between
   detectors to limit the influence of some subverted devices may be
   quite hazardous.

   Eventually, note that sharing symmetric material for partial



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   authentication between more than two devices would make Byzantine
   detection impossible to achieve in most cases (and so would do the
   absence of an authentication mechanism).

6.1.2.4 Byzantine Robustness

   Purpose of Byzantine robustness, in the general problem context, is
   for any given device to achieve algorithm termination, agreement and
   -naturally- validity.

   Routing protocols does NOT REQUIRE to achieve neither agreement nor
   termination.  What matters here is validity, with regard to the
   requirements concerning reachability presented Section 2.1.  This
   manages opportunities for ``severed configurations'' in which some
   policy requirements for a traffic could not be enforced though
   reachability is still possible / probable.

6.2 Data Control Plane

6.2.1 Data Integrity / Source Authenticity

   Messages at the data control plane MUST be protected agaisnt
   unauthorized modifications. This implies that exchanges are protected
   by a combination of authenticity, integrity and anti-replay
   properties.

6.2.2 Legitimacy

   Inbound data SHOULD be checked for it's legitimacy.

   [TBD] One may investigate use of authorization tokens to do this.

   Aggregation will certainly jeopardize such a property. Depending on
   the bandwidth available, it may be possible to do without aggregation
   for the exchanges (this does not imply that local forwarding table
   may not aggregate entries).

6.2.3 Dampening mechanisms for DOS mitigation

   The rates at which updates are accepted and probably unstable routes
   are propagated MUST be limited.

   Further information is available in [DAMPING].

6.2.4 Paths for addressing underclaiming/overclaiming

   [TBD] We should remove this section. Protection against overclaiming

   aggregation happen). Underclaiming was discarded in the threat doc.

6.3 Transport Subsystem

   The Transport Subsystem may already provide the following properties:

   o  [OLD] (The alternate version below (from Russ) is well formulated)
      Neighborhood: a technology may provide a way to address adjacent
      neighbors.  The neighborhood range in this kind of technology is
      typically of one system away and relies on direct mapping over
      functions available from the Link Layer.

   o  Neighbors discovery and maintenance: A given Transport Subsystem
      technology may provide a way to discover and communicate with
      adjacent devices participating in the routing domain (neighbors).

   o  [OLD] Integrity: the Transport Subsystem may provide data
      integrity.  This is insufficient to achieve security without
      proper means of authenticating the system which provided the
      integrity proof in the first place.

   o  Integrity: While the Transport Subsystem chosen by the routing
      protocol designer may provide error detection code, this does not
      provide data integrity from a security point of view. The
      Transport Subsystem may also provide data integrity which will
      still be useless from a security perspective if the proof is
      hop-by-hop or if the secret material used by the data integrity
      service cannot be tied to the routing protocol participant
      identity.

   o  Authenticity: if the underlying layer both provides authenticity
      and integrity, many routing threats may be thwarted.  Further
      investigations are required though, among which are studies of
      resistance to replay, performance, Byzantine detection and
      robustness, etc.  In such a case, the documentation of the routing
      protocol MUST state which security properties are provided by the
      Transport Layer, which are provided by the routing protocol design
      and eventually how they interact.

   o  Separate control channel: if the underlying technology provides
      separated channels for control traffic and user data traffic, this
      may help against DOS against the routing protocol.  Such control
      channels may be provided via the same Link Layer infrastructure,
      or perhaps via a distinct network.

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


6.3.1 Generic Requirements / Expectation

   The choice of the Transport Subsystem for the routing protocol may
   ease the requirements.  Any routing protocol designed to run on a
   specific Transport Subsystem MUST document or provide appropriate
   references to the security properties provided by the Transport
   Subsystem.

   [TBD] A MUST sounds reasonable ?

   A routing protocol designed to be, within a certain extent, Transport
   Subsystem independent, may provide options to activate built-in
   security features on-demand when security provided by a Transport
   Subsystem is insufficient.  Though such a flexibility would help
   avoiding potential redundancy of functions with the Transport
   Subsystem and adjusting performance requirements, such an approach is
   usually not desirable because of it's added complexity and hazards
   and because such a protocol can no longer be ``bridged'' between two
   different Transport Subsystems without further processing.

   [TBD] The above is complicated a bit. Who would do that anyway ? Do
   we remove this ?

6.3.2 Layer 2

   Layer two is limited to one (IP) system away. Addressing is available
   in anycast, multicast and broadcast.

   Some Layer 2 technologies are bundled with built-in cryptographic
   protections. However, these are often unused because they require
   extra management.

   It is highly restrictive to build a routing protocol security upon
   the use of a specific layer 2 technology. This greatly limits the
   interest of deploying an instance of the protocol.

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


6.4.3 Unicast

6.5 Neighbors

   Neighbors are the peers involved in routing operations which can be
   reached within a maximum number of hops (according to the routing
   protocol itself).  Often, neighbors definition is limited to the
   systems that are directly reachable through with the Link Layer,
   regardless of the technology actually used for the Transport Layer of
   the routing protocol.

   There are several ways to ensure that the routing information
   actually comes from a system within a max range.  Note that this does
   not prove that the message itself has been sent by the legitimate
   system (for instance, it may be a replay from subverted link).  It is
   also possible to provide such a feature within the routing protocol.

   From a service point of view, it is the original sender's goal to
   limit the range of it's messages.  From a security point of view, it
   is the recipient's responsibility to CHECK that the message does not
   come from outside the neighbors zone (e.g. : check use of limited
   broadcast in destination address field).  Use of the following
   recipes should mirror both these concerns.  Lastly, all of this only
   provides topological protection if used alone.

6.5.1 Use of TTL

   In IP packets, the TTL field being decreased by forwarders provides
   an easy way in order to limit packets propagation. However, this does
   not protect against outsiders, unless forwarders also act as relays,
   check origin authenticity of old TTL and authenticate the newly
   decreased value.

6.5.2 The TTL Hack

   The TTL hack [BTSH] is a way to limit the range effect of routing
   messages and to prevent intrusion in the neighborhood in IP networks.
   By setting TTL to max value (255), neighbors can check that the
   message comes from direct neighbors. Spoofed routing messages coming
   from outside the neighborhood range will get their TTL decreased and
   be rejected by the routing protocol participants.  This does not
   protect against insiders, nor against outsiders using tunnels to
   carry engineered packets.

6.5.3 Link Layer

   Direct use of the Link Layer instead of Network (IP) Layer for
   communications of the routing protocol limits neighborhood

   implicitly.  In some cases (VLAN frame hopping, Wireless LANs), an
   outsider may still break in the neighbors zone.

6.5.4 Limited Broadcast

   Limited broadcast is a simple way to ensure contact with neighbors on
   the local network when using a Transport Layer layered over IP.

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


7. Cryptographic Considerations

   This section presents cryptographic requirements for routing
   protocols.

7.1 Basic Cryptographic Requirements

   The following requirements are understood on a producer / consumer of
   the routing information basis.  Relays which modify the content of
   routing messages are considered both consumers and producers. Relays
   which do not modify the content of routing messages act as
   forwarders, are then considered neither producers nor consumers and
   SHOULD NOT need to provide any of the following while acting as
   forwarders.

   o  Integrity: data integrity between the producer and the consumer is
      an obvious requirement.  A checksum is not an integrity evidence.
      Means to have data integrity are signed-hash and keyed-hash. Data
      integrity is always closely related to authenticity (see below).

   o  Anti-replay: this comes here mainly for protection against active
      attacks from subverted Links, though this feature will also
      provide added protection against natural duplication of packets.
      Note that underlying layers may provide an unauthenticated
      anti-replay feature, which would be of no use from a security
      point of view, unless it gets also authenticated at the pouting
      protocol layer.  Authentication of routing exchanges sequence
      numbers may bring this protection to the protocol.

   o  Authentication: the above features are of no use without
      authentication of the producer.  Authenticating correctly the
      messages sent from neighbors is the most important security
      requirement for a routing protocol.  Authentication techniques
      that should be considered currently are: digital signature, keyed
      hash.

   o  [TBD] Is it also important to authenticate the consumer ? In some
      protocols, peers may establish sessions in which both are
      alternatively producer and consumer.  In the case such a
      `symmetric' rule does not apply, is there a need to authenticate
      the consumer or to make sure that only he can access the
      information ? Should the consumer acknowledge the reception ?
      Should the acknowledgement be authenticated ?

   There have been considerations of confidentiality as a mean to
   counter disclosure of network topology.  The gains from such a
   feature are not obvious, especially because traffic analysis of
   forwarded data may provide the topology disclosure, and also because



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   public information may be required in order to prove the legitimacy
   of routers for announcing or owning routes or prefixes. Besides, this
   involves additional performance issues and negotiations which are not
   particularly desirable.  Providing confidentiality is NOT REQUIRED.
   If such a feature is available, it SHOULD be possible to enable /
   disable it.

   [TBD] Although perhaps confidentiality is more important than
   supposed here.  Comments ? Topology disclosure may be a more
   significant threat for applications than for routing.  Should the
   routing protocol protect an information that could be used to attack
   another protocol ? Is topology disclosure eventually a significant
   threat for the routing protocol itself ?

7.2 Cryptographic Keys Requirements

   Key management involves several considerations, and routing protocols
   involve several interconnected devices, which may be the properties
   of distinct organizations.  A routing protocol design should analyze
   scaling issues; within this context, Public key cryptography is
   currently the most appropriate paradigm.

7.2.1 Public Key Cryptography

   [TBD] Disclaimer: I'm not sure this section is useful at all, unless
   we go in further details ? How far can we go in this specification ?
   e.g., Is it suitable to name protocol fields, and to set specific
   protection to these ?

   Public key cryptography is traditionally associated with drawbacks
   such as administration, deployment, reachability, caching.

   o  Administration cannot be avoided.  Because routing devices may not
      belong to the same organizations, a kind of trusted third party
      must exist to tie identities, public keys and possibly other
      contents like suitable addresses or legitimacy to advertise routes
      or originate prefixes.

   o  Deployment is mainly a scaling issue.  Temptation is great to rely
      upon a mechanism that (almost) succeeded in scaling (DNS, or the
      routing network itself).  On the other hand, care should be taken
      not to misuse or overload these mechanisms.  Correlation of such a
      mechanism with the routing protocol may lead to easy denials of
      service or other attacks that MUST be studied.

   o  Reachability of the public key information is REQUIRED.  This may
      be done in-band within the routing protocol, or through a
      stand-alone protocol.  In the latter case, specific consideration



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


      occurs regarding availability of the service under high traffic or
      when either forwarding or relaying are severed.  Reachability is
      useful in order to retrieve keys, but also for revocation checking
      or roll-overs.

   o  Caching should be considered for deployment, reachability and
      performance.  On the other hand, it jeopardizes revocation of keys
      or roll-over.  Eventually, authorizations or public material of
      the same kind may be kept in a non-volatile storage.


7.2.2 Crypto-hygiene

   Limiting key lifetime and refreshing them is good cryptographic
   hygiene.  Therefore, a mechanism to roll-over keys is REQUIRED both
   for public keys and for session keys; Public keys roll-over may not
   require a soft transition, while refreshing session keys may require
   to move from the old key to the new one with no session interruption.
   Lifetime MUST be evaluated both in terms of time and of amount of
   data.

7.2.3 Key Strength

   [TBD] Give correct lifetime for keys, in years against mips ? Is
   there a reference document on this topic ? What about: "m years after
   the standardization of the routing protocol, the keying material
   should resist n years against p top performance key cracking devices"
   ?

   Strength of public keys should be high.  Changing these keys may be
   administratively heavy if they are used in EGPs.  Besides, a third
   party may not emerge if keys have a short lifetime.  In IGPs,
   strength of these keys should not be that high, though this mainly
   depends on internal administration tasks scheduling. It is acceptable
   to tear down sessions between routing protocol participants when the
   public material is changed.

   Strength of symmetric keys does not require to be high: refresh may
   happen during low traffic periods (if they exist; if they do not, a
   suitable heuristic SHOULD enforce the refresh at an appropriate
   time), and verification must be fast.  These keys SHOULD be used only
   as a fast authentication schemes and the refresh SHOULD NOT result in
   torn down sessions.

7.3 Performances

   Device resources (CPU, memory) might be overloaded by cryptographic
   operations, especially by public key computations.  These performance



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   issues should be taken into account when designing a routing
   protocol, otherwise they would open the device to other forms of
   attacks (denials / degradations of service) that will result in the
   same consequences as attacks against routing operations.  Performance
   evaluation often requires hypothesis on the underlying hardware,
   which is somewhat restricting.

   When possible, methods to derive a symmetric key from public
   exponents should be used, given that the symmetric cryptography
   operations considered are less computationally expensive.  Caution
   should be taken if the number of devices sharing the same symmetric
   key is greater than two.

   There had been several discussions on the use of a token based fast
   rejection scheme, which could be embedded on interfaces of the
   devices.  Such a scheme would protect against a category of denials
   of service in which malign traffic gets in at a high rate.  The
   management of such a scheme may require a stand-alone protocol and
   raises issues when neighbors communicate through several interfaces.

   [TBD] Should we develop on other token-based schemes ? How about
   building interface dependent token chains when packets / frames are
   unicast ? This seems a bit tricky to achieve and would grow in
   square(n interfaces).  How about a less efficient approach where the
   tokens would be checked by the core CPU ? This would infer a little
   delay during normal service, but under attack this may avoid
   computation of HMAC or DSIG.  Is it acceptable to derive a token
   chain seed and a session key from only one shared secret material ?
   BTW, can the token provide the anti-replay feature if it is added
   within an HMAC computation (this, to save space) ? If so, is it still
   applicable when the tokens seed and the HMAC secret are derived from
   the same material ? Lastly, how about a 'reject with a cookie /
   re-request with cookie approach ?

   Neighbors authorizations and public materials may be stored in
   non-volatile storage.  Note that there may exist no route to get this
   material after a reboot.  However, the routing protocol itself may
   also assume in-band provisioning of public material.

   [TBD] Does in-band provisioning open a path for resources exhaustion
   ? Considerations of which other data should be stored in non-volatile
   storage ?

   Considerations regarding caching are presented in Section 7.2.1.

7.4 Use of Cryptography

   [TBD] This section should explain how the above cryptography



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   considerations will help countering common threats.  It may be wise
   to wait for the next version of the threat draft before going
   further.  Details are currently rejected in appendix.

   Correct use of anti-replay, integrity and authentication should
   suffice to protect against deception or usurpation damages resulting
   from subverted links or devices (as long as the secret materials are
   unavailable to the attacker).

   This will be insufficient to prevent disclosure or disruption.

   [TBD] Do we need to prevent disclosure anyway ?

   Subverted routers which are still authorized participants (that is:
   subverted routers owning the suitable material) in the routing
   protocol, will be able to process with attacks resulting in all of
   these damages.  Further protection requires a registry stating
   authorizations for the routing devices to be available, in order to
   enforce least privileges to the subverted device.  This information
   would be authenticated by an adequate entity.

   Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.2 details which and how threats mentioned
   in [THREATS] are thwarted by the requirements presented in this
   document.

   The following sections present additional guidance for the specific
   classes a routing protocol belongs to.

7.5 Specific Considerations for External Gateway Protocols

   [TBD] Extract from Russ comments: I think you can mention this, but
   it's actually going to be difficult to impossible to find any way of
   securing policies within an EGP. Since each administrative domain can
   add policies to a given route, anyone can essentially insert any
   policy. The question: "Who's policy are we honoring" has to be
   answered before we can begin to think about this. The originator's
   policy? Or the AS we received the route from? Or the AS that
   currently has the route? Or some other AS?

   Related considerations:

7.6 Specific Considerations for Link State Protocols

   [TBD] Are there such considerations ? May be we should design dummy
   protocols to be more explicit or set up a high level division of RPs
   features.

7.7 Specific Considerations for Distance Vectors Protocols

   Distance vector routing protocols are specific because participants
   are required to adjust the properties of routes announced by other
   participants.

   [TBD] Present appropriate protection of attributes.  The originator
   may authenticate the initial information, and relays may stack in
   authenticated costs adjustments, route characteristics updates, etc.
   [SMITH].  We have to decide whether trace-ability of distance
   adjustments is critical security feature or not.

8. Active Participation to Security

   Topics presented within this section may not be directly tied to the
   protocol design.  However, it addresses several local considerations
   that are requirements for a secure operation of the routing protocol
   and of the device it is running on.

8.1 Checking

   A routing device may be configured to run extra checks on the routing
   state, like checking databases against previous information.  Some
   active tests may also be triggered: sending source routed ICMP
   packets, etc.  Such tests may also involve the neighbors.  High
   caution should be taken regarding implementation of such features and
   they should not jeopardize the routing protocol mechanisms.

8.1.1 Passively

8.1.2 Actively

   (quantity a/o quality)

8.2 Reporting

8.2.1 Error Messages

8.2.2 Auditable Events

   The following events should be audited:

   1.  Authentication failure

   2.  Required public information (keys, authority) is not available

   3.  Errors reported by forwarders

   4.  Detection of a Byzantine event

   5.  Detection of a rebooting peer

   [TBD] The above has nothing to do with routing.  Or has-it ? Should
   the protocol automate detect and act according to the detection of
   these events ?

8.3 Reacting

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


8.3.1 Routing Databases

8.3.1.1 Graceful degradation

8.3.1.2 Fail-back Procedures

   When detecting obvious routing misbehavior which result from misuse
   of the routing protocol, but when sources responsible for this
   misbehavior cannot be identified (no Byzantine detection), fail-back
   procedures may be attempted, based on previous recorded states,
   fail-safe states or heuristics on the routing information and on
   trust.  Degradation of the service should often be better than no
   service at all, thus the device may adjust local route costs
   information when such events occur.  The routing protocol design may
   document guidelines and requirements on such procedures.

   Network management must be able to install unalterable (static)
   routes to allow debugging network problems without interference from
   routing protocols.

8.3.2 Filtering

   Ingress Filtering, participant exclusion.

   A routing device MAY be set to drop/reject routing messages if these
   are incorrect with current configuration of the network, e.g.  if
   they do not belong to the correct range of the IGP, etc.

   Note that this protection is topological and partial.  Extreme care
   should be taken not to jeopardize correct behavior of the protocol.

8.3.3 Correcting

   Correcting wrong / malicious routing info

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


9. Local Resources Considerations 
    
   Even though this document addresses routing protocols, these cannot 
   operate without a platform of hardware and software to support them. 
   All the resources belonging to this platform form what is generally 
   referred to as a router. Thus, routers comprise all local resources 
   of a routing daemon participating in a routing session. 
    
   This section will first highlight critical underlying components and 
   their security issues regarding Denial of Service (DoS) 
   vulnerabilities and then suggest suitable routing protocols' 
   requirements addressing these issues. 
    
9.1 Denial of Service Attacks 
    
   The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
   [http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html] defines 
   Denial of Service attacks as being explicit attempts by attackers to 
   prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. 
   Denial of Service attacks can be launched against a target for the 
   mere purpose of preventing the victim from using a resource or can 
   be a component of a greater attack that may ultimately aim at 
   stealing information. 
    
   A modern router is a complex system made of several hardware and 
   software components that interact in the effort to serve the general 
   purpose of routing as defined in paragraph 2.1. All of these 
   components are finite resources and therefore intrinsically prone to 
   Denial of Service. The impact of Denial of Service attacks on 
   certain local resources can be critical for the routing protocols 
   running on them. 
    
9.2 Hardware Resources 
    
   Almost every hardware component in a router is essential to the 
   correct functioning of the local instances of the various routing 
   protocols that run on it, for example - trivially speaking - without 
   power no packets will be routed.  Among others buffers/queues and 
   CPU cycles are two of the less obvious resources that are critical 
   for routing protocols. 
    
9.2.1 Buffers/Queues 
    
   Buffers are widely used in hardware to store information that needs 
   to be aggregated or delayed before being consumed. In general once a 
   buffer is full every subsequent object that needs to be stored in 
   that queue will simply be discarded. Depending on what messages are 
   discarded, the consequences of dropping information for routing 



Puig, et al.             Expires April 23, 2004                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


   protocols can vary from negligible to critical. 
    
   Since all messages exchanged between participants to a routing 
   session need to reach the control-plane, the queues and buffers that 
   support this link are critical for routing protocols.  Often people 
   are deceived by thinking that the throughput of a switching fabric 
   is roughly the amount of bandwidth needed to launch a DoS attack 
   against a given router; in reality, routers have smaller bandwidth 
   links toward the control plane. The goal of an attacker could be 
   easier in terms of resources, if he/she were to attempt to exhaust 
   the buffers and queues on the link to the control plane with bogus 
   control plane packets rather than trying to congest the resources 
   serving the switching fabric. The goal of such attacks would be to 
   cause queues and buffers to drop legitimate routing messages 
   together with bogus ones. 
    
9.2.2 CPU Cycles 
    
   Processors units, and in particular Network Processors (NPs), are a 
   valuable resource that can perform predetermined sets of operations 
   during a single cycle. Generally speaking, CPU cycles are a finite 
   resource that is shared among many different processes, some of 
   these being instances of routing protocols. As a consequence of 
   congestion, and from an oversimplified point of view, some processes 
   may be put "on hold" until more CPU cycles are available, or every 
   process may be "starved a bit". Both scenarios may cause great 
   damage to interactive processes. In particular routing protocols' 
   instances may enter critical states where a timely reaction to an 
   event is necessary but not available. 
    
   In general the more a CPU serves an heterogeneous pool of processes, 
   the more easy it will be for an attacker (or a faulty router) to 
   find a single service/process that will exhaust a significant 
   portion of the available CPU cycles, denying service to other 
   processes, such as routing.  
    
9.2.3 Buffer/Queues and CPU Cycles Requirements 
    
   Routing messages SHOULD be identifiable as coming from legitimate 
   participants in their routing session before being directed towards 
   the control-plane.  
    
   If any rate limiting mechanism is intended by the routing protocol 
   to mitigate congestion of control-plane links, said solution MUST be 
   designed ensuring that an attacker cannot directly exploit it in the 
   attempt to block a legitimate routing peer from exchanging routing 
   messages.

Internet-Draft    Routing Protocols Security Requirements   October 2003


9.2.4 Bandwidth 
    
   Routing protocols are based on the exchange of information between 
   the participants to a session over network links. A link's bandwidth 
   is finite critical resource that, if starved, can lead to Denial of 
   Service attacks on the routing protocols. If a link is not 
   malfunctioning, and neglecting transmission errors, then DoS attacks 
   on a link's bandwidth can only take place at the link's ends. A 
   router may receive an aggregate of traffic higher than it can be 
   forwarded by a given output interface, or a receiving router may not 
   be capable of handling the current load of traffic incoming on a 
   given interface due to an internal scheduling priority problem or 
   because it entered a critical or unknown state. 
    
9.2.4.1 General Mitigation Techniques 
    
   Some mitigation techniques can be deployed to limit the exhaustion 
   of bandwidth between two routing peers; two current examples are: 
   ingress filtering, as described in RFC 2827 [FILTERING], and 
   solutions that relay on Quality of Service mandating that the 
   highest priority and availability be assigned to routing messages.  
    
9.2.5 Bandwidth Requirements 
    
   Routing protocols MUST be designed to easily inter-work with lower 
   layers Quality of Service mechanisms. 
    
9.3 Logic (Software) Resources 
    
   Similarly to hardware resources, logic resources can be finite and 
   therefore exhausted thus affording attackers with the possibility of 
   launching Denial of Service attacks. Databases are critical 
   resources for every routing protocol and they may contain 
   information about link-state, direct neighbors, active peers, 
   external routes database, etc... 
    
   Routing databases have a maximum number of entries that can be 
   stored in them and this is generally not defined by the routing 
   protocols. This upper bound can be set by an administrator through a 
   configuration parameter or can be restricted only by the hardware 
   memory available to the routing platform. Either way, when this 
   limit is approaching, for any of the databases maintained by a 
   routing protocol, some action must be taken. 
    
9.3.1 Logic (Software) Requirements 
    
   Routing protocols MUST mandate verification of every piece of 
   information that can be verified before committing it to any

   underlying database. 
    
   Every piece of information that cannot be verified by the routing 
   protocol immediately MUST be marked as temporary and means should be 
   provided, by the routing protocol itself, to keep track of these 
   entries, verify and discard them as soon as possible. 
    
   Every piece of information that cannot be verified by the routing 
   protocol MUST be installed in the apposite database with the minimum 
   time to live compatible with its function.  
    
   Routing protocols MUST provide mechanisms for routing platforms' 
   databases, in overflow state, to discard information that will cause 
   minimum possible disruption to the routing session. 
    
   Routing protocols SHOULD be designed as to incorporate feed-back 
   solutions from databases approaching overflow state so that 
   mitigative actions can be taken. 
    
   Routing protocols SHOULD be designed with the concept of graceful 
   degradation in mind in order to better survive in case any of the 
   underlying databases approaches or enters overflow state.

10. Inter domain routing issues

10.1 Legitimacy

   Availability of the required material (caching/storing)

   [Note] It should be clear that a light paradigm would better fit in
   most cases, so we should avoid the acronym PKI as much as possible,
   though we have to deal with the problem of the trusted party at some
   point.

10.2 Policies

   Note that policy propagation within a routing protocol which operates
   between administrative routing domains, exterior gateway protocols,
   is very difficult. This particular area of security is fraught with
   difficulties making it next to impossible to actually secure policy
   across multiple administrative domains.

10.3 Agreements involving operators

   Secure EGPs operations will require kind of agreements between the
   involved parties.  Though operators may achieve these agreements on a
   case by case basis, this is unlikely to be effective in the field.
   Emergence of trusted third parties upon which would rely the
   diffusion of public key material and relations to prefix ownership
   would fit better.

   Another question is whether these pieces of information must be tied
   with public information related to the system ownership, such as the
   organization name.  This may lead to specific routing policies or
   abuses that would introduce more complexity.

   [TBD] Currently, signed tuples carrying /identity (WRT to RP),
   address(es), public key, authorization on prefixes and adequate
   lifetimes/ should be discussed.

10.3.1 Announcing Routes

   [TBD] Legitimacy for advertising routes / updating information. Using
   authorization paradigms should be sufficient.

10.3.2 Originating a Prefix / Ownership

   [TBD] Ways to prove the right to advertise a prefix.  Where will we
   find the appropriate victim for the administration of these pieces of
   information ?

11. Security Considerations

   This entire informational draft RFC is security related. Specifically
   it addresses security of routing protocols as associated with
   requirements to those protocols.  In a larger context, this work
   builds upon the recognition of the IETF community that signaling and
   control/management planes of networked devices need strengthening.
   Routing protocols can be considered part of that signaling and
   control plane, may be the most important.  However, to date, routing
   protocols have largely remained unprotected and opened to malicious
   attacks.  This document discusses inter and intra domain routing
   protocol security requirements as we know them today and lays the
   foundation for the design of new, more secure, routing protocols.

Appendix B. Protection achieved by the requirements

B.1 Protection from Threat Sources

B.1.1 Subverted Links

   Partial protection against subverted links is gained with
   authenticated integrity proof and anti-replay. These links can still
   eavesdrop, delay, drop messages.

B.1.2 Subverted Devices


B.2 Protection from Threat Actions

B.2.1 Deliberate Exposure

   Unless there is some odd use of assigned numbers (part of the public
   address space, etc.) required by local configuration, deliberate
   exposure will only mostly result in disclosure of local routing
   information.  If ciphers are used between peers, the disclosure will
   be limited to participants sharing the key material.  Note however
   that the value of the disclosed information may not be high.

   If an entity makes fun use of assigned numbers (we are above all
   concerned about address spaces and AS numbers here), then the
   deliberate exposure also becomes a falsification (refer to the
   adequate section).

B.2.2 Sniffing

   Measure against sniffing may be encryption of routing exchanges. It
   is not obvious that the intrinsic value of routing information
   justify an additional resources investment.

   On the other hand, use of steganography or illusions may be
   investigated though chances that this provides a powerful alternative
   are low, even on high bandwidth links.

B.2.3 Traffic Analysis

B.2.4 Spoofing

B.2.5 Falsification

   Authentication of sources should help here (care of anti-replay).
   Special considerations apply to DVPs.
