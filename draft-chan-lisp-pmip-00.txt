                   Integrating PMIP into LISP Network
                        draft-chan-lisp-pmip-00

Abstract

   PMIP and LISP are both network-based.  Integration of PMIP with a
   hierarchical design into the LISP network provides network-based
   fast-mobility support to enable a mobile node to perform handover in
   both LISP and non-LISP networks, and non-optimal PMIP routes in the
   LISP network are avoided.

1.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [I-D.ietf-lisp] belongs to
   the family of protocols to distinguish between routing locators
   (RLOCs) and endpoint identifiers (EIDs) and maintains a mapping
   between them.  It takes a network-based approach by using RLOC for
   routing in the transit core networks and EID within a network.
   Therefore a site may, among other things, use its EID as a stable
   identifier even upon change of its RLOC.

   In comparison, Mobile IP (MIP) [RFC3775], also distinguishes between
   a care-of-address (CoA) and a home address (HoA) of a mobile node
   (MN) and maintains a mapping between them at the home agent in the
   home network.  The CoA is used for routing and may change as the
   mobile node changes its attachement.  The mobile node may then use
   the stable home address as a session identifier so that the IP
   session is not broken upon change of routing address.  The network-
   based variant of MIP is proxy mobile IP (PMIP) [RFC5213], which
   replaces the CoA of the MN with the routing address is the proxy-CoA
   of a mobile access gateway (MAG) which performs the mobility
   signaling on behalf of the MN.

   Because both LISP and PMIP are network based and because PMIPv6 is
   designed to support mobility in non-LISP network, integrating PMIPv6
   into the LISP network will provide network-based mobility in both
   LISP and non-LISP networks.

3.  PMIP in a non-LISP network and comparison with LISP

   which is shown in Figure 1(b), with LISP, which is shown in Figure
   1(a).

   Figure 1. (a) LISP network, (b) PMIP in non-LISP network.

   Both LISP and PMIP use map and encapsulation.  Yet there are also
   differences between them.

   In LISP, the mapping is between the site prefix, which is the EID,
   and the RLOC of the ETR serving the site.  In PMIP, the mapping is
   between the home address (HoA) of MN and the proxy CoA of the MAG
   serving the MN.

   In LISP, the ITR queries the map server through a map resolver.  The
   ITR then tunnels the packet to the ETR, which will deliver the packet
   to the site.  In PMIP, the mapping information is located at the
   mobility anchor so that the mobility anchor will tunnel the packet to
   the MAG, which will then deliver the packet to the MN.

   In LISP, the source of information on how to deliver packet to the

   site is kept at the ETR, and the ETRs in different networks provide
   these information to the mapping system.  The ITR queries the mapping
   system only when needed.  In PMIP, the source of information on where
   the MN is located is at the MAG, and the different MAGs provide these
   information to the mapping information system that is located in the
   mobility anchor.

   In LISP, routing is via the ETR that serves the site so that the
   route is already optimized.  Yet in PMIP, the mobility anchor can be
   far from both the CN and the MN so that the route via the mobility
   anchor can be far from being optimal.


4.  PMIP in a LISP network

   The MN can be in either a non-LISP network or a LISP network.  The
   senario with the MN in a non-LISP network is already shown in Figure
   1(b).  We therefore only need to consider the senario in which the MN
   is in a LISP network.

   The integration of PMIP into the LISP network is illustrated in
   Figure 2.  A hierarchy is introduced into the PMIP using the concept
   of hierarchical MIP (HMIP) [RFC5380].

   Figure 2 Integrating a hierarchy of PMIP into LISP network.

   In the LISP network, two levels of hierarchy are involved.  The LISP
   mapping system and the LMA both keep the mapping between the HoA of
   the MN and the RLOC of the new ETR; the ETR keeps the mapping between
   the HoA of the MN and the proxy CoA of the MAG.  In terms of the role
   of maintaining the mapping information, the ETR behaves like a LMA to
   the MAG, whereas the LISP mapping system behaves like a LMA to the
   ETR.

   It is certainly possible to run PMIP without this hierarchy.  Yet
   utilizing this hierarchy in the LISP network enables route
   optimization.  In addition, it also significantly reduces the amount
   of mapping updates in the LMA because the majority of handovers are
   expected to be between two MAG's under the same ETR.

4.1.  MN being stationary at its home link

   When an MN first attaches to a network, it may obtain an IP address
   (HoA) from that network, which is its home network.  As long as MN

   does not move away from this home link, routing to reach this MN does
   not need tunneling in this network.  This situation is the same for
   both the LISP network and the non-LISP network.

   The LISP mapping system is therefore not affected.

   A related senarios is as follows: The MN may first attach to a site
   in a LISP network and obtain a globally unique IP address (HoA) from
   the site.  The site may be using a provider independent network
   prefix so that it is supported by LISP to change provider or to
   multi-home to different provider networks.  The MN may move within
   the site, and the reachability of the MN within this site may be
   managed by the site itself.  Then LISP is again not affected.

4.2.  MN handover within its home network

   When an MN performs handover within its home network, it may continue
   to use its HoA using PMIP.  If this home network is a LISP network
   served by an ETR, the ETR acts at the mobility anchor as illustrated
   in Figure 3.  An equivalent way to look at it is that the LMA
   funciton co-locates with the ETR.  To the MAG, the ETR behaves like
   the local mobility anchor (LMA) defined in PMIP.  The tunneling is
   between the ETR and the new MAG using the proxy CoA of the MAG.

   Figure 3 MN running PMIP in LISP home network.

   As long as the MN is within its home network, the LISP mapping system
   is unaffected.  That is, the senario in Figure 3 is a simplified
   version of Figure 2 with which the LISP mapping system does not need
   an additional entry for the MN.

   The above senario includes the case in which the MN originally
   attaches to a site supported by LISP and then leaves the site but is
   under the same ETR as the site.

4.3.  MN handover to a visited LISP network

   An MN that has moved to a new LISP network could simply use a new IP
   from the new network so that the new network has now become its new
   home network.  Yet the MN may need to use its HoA which it has
   acquired from the previous network.  The LISP mapping system needs to
   keep an updated mapping between the HoA of the MN and the RLOC of the
   ETR of the visited network.  The ETR also needs to keep an updated
   mapping between the HoA of the MN and the proxy CoA of the new MAG.

Internet-Draft                   DMM-PS                     October 2010


   The new MAG needs to perform proxy binding update with the new ETR on
   behalf of the MN, whereas the new ETR needs to perform both a mapping
   update with the LISP mapping system and a proxy binding update with
   the LMA of the MN.  The update to the LISP mapping system ensures
   that packets destined to the MN are forwarded to the ETR of the
   visited network, whereas the update with the LMA ensures that packets
   originating from non-LIST network will also be forwarded to this ETR.

4.4.  MN handover within a visited LISP network

   After a handover to a visited LISP network, the MN may peform
   additional handovers within that visited network.  When the MN
   performs such handover from one MAG to another MAG under the same ETR
   in the visited LISP network, only the mapping system at the ETR needs
   to update the binding between the HoA of the MN and the proxy CoA of
   the new MAG.  The new MAG performs proxy binding update with the ETR
   on behalf of the MN.  This senario is a simplified version of Figure
   2 in which the LISP mapping system does not need further update.
