3.  Goals

   The goals of the protocol are:

   Identity Information Exchange:

      The primary goal of any DIX protocol is to automate the exchange
      of Identity Information over the Internet.


   Ease of Adoption:

      Any DIX protocol must provide the lowest possible barriers to
      adoption to ensure wide-spread usage of the protocol.


   Internet Scale:

      Any DIX protocol must provide an Internet scale solution to
      identity information exchange.


   Privacy:

      Any DIX protocol must ensure that all aspects of user privacy can
      be maintained.

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases       March 2006


5.  Browser Based Use Cases

   Some use cases are dependent upon others, so should be perused in
   order.  Beth is our protagonist throughout; a typical Internet user,
   but she's a bit of a geek.

5.1.  B1

   Beth receives an email from a friend introducing her to a new
   website, geeknews.com, a techie news site.  She wishes to sign up so
   that she can read some articles.  She sees an IN button, which she
   clicks.  Her identity agent displays a screen informing her that
   geeknews.com is requesting some data, her first name.  She enters
   'Beth' at the prompt, provides consent and the data is sent to the
   site.

5.2.  B2

   Beth browses to geekdate.com, she clicks an IN button.  Her identity
   agent informs her that geekdate.com is requesting some data, her
   first name.  Her agent already has this data.  She provides consent
   and the data is sent to the site.

5.3.  B3

   Beth decides to create a profile at geekdate.com.  She sees an IN
   button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent displays a screen
   informing her that geekdate.com is requesting some data, an
   Identifier.  She provides consent and the data is sent to the site.

5.4.  B4

   Beth decides to flesh out her profile at geekdate.com.  Geekdate.com
   displays a registration form.  One field requests a URL of a photo of
   her.  Beside it is a SAVE button.  She enters the URL and clicks the
   button.  Her identity agent displays a screen informing her that this
   data item can be stored.  She decides that she wants to be able to
   provide that data to other sites.  She provides consent and the data
   is stored by her agent.

5.5.  B5

   Geeknews.com offers Beth the option to build up a readership
   preferences profile over time, the benefit being that the site will
   tailor its content to her interests.  She decides to take up the
   offer, she sees an IN button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent
   informs her that geeknews.com is requesting some data, an Identifier.
   She selects an existing identifier that represents a subset of her

   identity, which is used for a subset of the sites she has a
   relationship with.  She provides consent and the data is sent to the
   site.

5.6.  B6

   Geeknews.com offers Beth the option to build up a readership
   preferences profile over time, the benefit being that the site will
   tailor its content to her interests.  She decides to take up the
   offer, she sees an IN button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent
   informs her that geeknews.com is requesting some data, an Identifier.
   She selects an existing identifier that represents a subset of her
   identity, which is used for a subset of the sites she has a
   relationship with.  She provides consent and the data is sent to the
   site.

5.7.  B7

   Beth wants to have multiple identifiers, for different aspects of
   herself, her personas.  She wants to have a 'home' persona for
   identity data that she releases to her personal sites, such as
   geeknews.com.  She wants to have a separate 'work' persona for
   identity data that she releases to work-related sites, such as
   helpdesk.com.  She wants some of her identity data to be the same for
   her different personas, and other data to be different.

5.8.  B8

   [Assumptions: Beth has visited geeknews and geekdate before and has
   informed her identity agent that she consents to a relationship with
   them.]  Beth starts her day with a strong coffee and a perusal of
   geeknews.com.  She starts her computer and authenticates herself to
   the operating system.  By that authentication mechanism she has also
   authenticated herself to her identity agent, as her vendor of that
   system has hooked it into the operating system's authentication
   system.  She browses to geeknews.com and clicks the IN button and is
   directly shown the content, no further clicks.  She then browses to
   geekdate.com, she clicks the IN button and is directly presented with
   her profile no further clicks.

5.9.  B9

   Beth's identity agent prompts her to provide a 'spoken name'.  Using
   the multimedia capabilities of her computer she records her spoken
   name; an mp3 of her saying 'Beth'.  She later browses to
   voicebox.com, which runs a voicemail service, she opts to create an
   account and the site requests some properties, amongst which is a
   request for her spoken name.  She provides consent and the data is

   sent to the site.

5.10.  B10

   Beth purchases a book from an online store, as she's checking out the
   store makes her an offer: 10% off for completion of a demographic
   survey.  She's tempted, but how many data fields are there?  One
   hundred!  Too many to be worth the effort.  But it happens to be
   commonly requested data, which she has already entered during
   previous exchanges with other sites.  So, she completes the remaining
   fields, saving them to her identity agent for future reuse.  She
   provides consent and the data is sent to the site.

5.11.  B11

   Beth has invested significant effort in building up a persona and
   reputation around a specific identifier, her 'home' identifier.  But,
   she has become dissatisfied with her identity agent and so decides to
   switch vendors.  She establishes the new agent and migrates her
   identity data from the old one to the new one.  She then administers
   her identifier so that her new identity agent is authoritative for
   authentication and provision of identity data.

5.12.  B12

   Whilst in town Beth stops off at an Internet Cafe to check her email.
   She goes to her webmail account, which requires that she identity
   herself.  Her Identity Agent prompts her for consent and provides her
   identifier so that she can gain access to her email.

5.13.  B13

   Beth visits a website that requests some identity information.  Her
   Identity Agent warns her that satisfying the request would contravene
   her established privacy policy.

5.14.  B14

   Beth moves house, so she changes the home address information stored
   by her Identity Agent.  Her Identity Agent offers to notify all
   relying parties to whom she has previously provided her home address.

5.15.  B15

   Beth is a frequent traveler on Galactic Air, whose site offers a
   claim of membership for use at affiliate sites.  She acquires a
   membership claim, which her Identity Agent stores for her.

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases       March 2006


5.16.  B16

   Beth visits a Galactic Air affiliate site that provides discounted
   travel insurance for frequent travelers.  She presents her Galactic
   Air membership claim and receives a discount.

5.17.  B17

   Beth visits a rental cars site.  She opts out of the offered drivers
   insurance as she is covered by her travel insurance.  To complete the
   booking the site requests a claim that she has valid insurance.  Her
   identity agent is unable to satisfy the request so provides a list of
   suggested sources.  Beth picks her insurance provider and her
   identity agent acquires the required claim and presents it to the
   rental car site.

5.18.  B18

   A couple of months later Beth books another trip.  The travel site
   requests her claim of Galactic Air membership.  Her identity agent
   finds that the claim has expired, so refreshes it by requesting an
   updated claim from galacticair.com.

5.19.  B19

   Beth leaves work and goes to the bus stop.  Whilst waiting for the
   next bus home she uses her smart phone to browse geeknews.com.  Her
   Identity Agent provides her with the same ease of browsing that she
   experiences on her work and home computers.

5.20.  B20

   Beth is ending her day at work.  She leaves work and waits for the
   next bus home.  Her friend calls and invites her to the movies.  She
   uses her phone to browse to the movies.com to find out what's
   playing.  The site requests her current location, which she consents
   to release via her Identity Agent.

5.21.  B21

   Beth signs up with a financial services site, BigPicture.com, which
   provides an aggregate view of her finances.  She provides the site
   with agency rights over each of her existing bank accounts.

5.22.  B22

   Beth goes to an auction side, ibay.com.  Her Identity Agent shows a
   signed graphic of ibay.com for releasing data.  Beth knows that she's

   dealing with ibay.com, and not an impostor.

5.23.  B23

   Beth visits her online bank, which requires the use of a strong
   authentication mechanism.  She authenticates to her Identity Agent
   using a two-factor device indicated by the bank to be an acceptable
   mechanism.

5.24.  B24

   Adam uses a service to acquire a verified email claim.  With it he
   can prove that he owns his email address, Adam@example.com, without
   having to go through a verification process.

5.25.  B25

   Beth gives her friend, Adam@example.com, access to her photos.  Adam
   receives an email from Beth inviting him to view her photos.  He goes
   to the site, which requests a verified email claim.  He presents his
   claim and gains access to the photos Beth has published for him.

5.26.  B26

   Adam decides to create a profile at geekdate.com. geekdate.com
   requests an Identifier.  He instructs his identity agent to create an
   identifier specific to his relationship with geekdate.com.

5.27.  B27

   Adam visits a site that requires that he prove he is over 21.  He
   provides the site with a claim that he is over 21 from the government
   of his country of residence, gov.ca.  The site is unable to find out
   who Adam is from gov.ca.

5.28.  B28

   Adam returns to the same site.  He must again prove that he is over
   21.  He provides a claim, but the site cannot tell that it is Adam
   that has returned again to the site.

5.29.  B29

   Adam heavily frequents two gambling sites, goldenslots.com and
   luckydice.com.  He uses the same identifier across both sites as he
   wants them to know he is the same person.

5.30.  B30

   Beth provides a claim from galacticair.com to many different
   websites.  She wants all of the sites to know that she is the same
   person providing the claim, so she can receive a free flight at the
   end of the year.

5.31.  B31

   Beth's employer has partnered with a local university to provide it's
   staff with access to online courses.  She signs up for some modules
   at the university admissions website acquiring an enrollment claim.

   for an advanced programming course.  The site requests claims that
   she is an employee, that she has previously completed some basic
   introdBtory modules, and that she has been enrolled.

5.32.  B32

   Beth is shopping online for a new laptop computer.  She visits an
   online site that caters to recently graduated professionals.  She
   selects a machine and investigates the lease options available.  To
   work out the monthly payment the site requests some claims: A claim
   that she's an alumni of a university, so that the site can include an
   appropriately branded tote bag.  A claim that she's a member of
   Galactic Air, so that she can be credited with airmiles for her
   purchase.  And, a claim from a credit scoring agency that she has a
   'good' credit rating.

5.33.  B33

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases       March 2006


6.  Non Browser Based Use Cases

6.1.  NB1 - REST

   Beth wants to use QOPO.com for printing her pictures that are stored
   in flackr.  She visits QOPO.com and her identity agent is instructed
   to acquire a token from flackr.  Her Identity Agent retrieves the
   token from flackr and presents it to QOPO.com.  QOPO.com passes the
   token over the REST based web service that flackr provides to
   retrieve her photos for printing.

6.2.  NB2

   Beth is a big fan of Rocky Gervas and listens to his podcast
   fanatically.  The Rocky Gervas show recently started charging a small
   fee for the podcast.  Her media player polls the podcast
   periodically.  When polled the site requests a claim from Beth's
   Identity Agent asserting that Beth has paid for the podcast.  Beth's
   Identity Agent retrieves the claim presents it to the site and the
   latest episode of The Rocky Gervas show is downloaded.

6.3.  NB3 - WebDAV

   At work Beth uses her website editing software (a WebDAV client) to
   publish some company confidential content to their extranet.  Beth is
   collaborating with Charles at another company, who requires access to
   the content.  Beth configures the extranet to allow Charles access.
   Charles uses his website editing software (also a WebDAV client) to
   fetch the content.  The extranet site requests identity information,
   which his client presents from his Identity agent, and he is able to
   edit the content.

6.4.  NB4 - AtomPub

   Beth uses a blogging client (AtomPub) to both post content to her
   blog and to add comments on other people's blog postings.  Her client
   uses her identity agent to associate identifying information (her
   blog url and favicon) with her comments.

6.5.  NB5 - XCAP and SIMPLE

   Beth uses her instant messaging client (a SIMPLE client) to
   communicate with her friends.  She uses her client to update her
   profile information (via XCAP), adding a new friend.  Her client
   didn't need to authenticate to her XCAP server, as she had already
   authenticated herself to her identity agent.

6.6.  NB6 - CalDAV

   Beth needs to arrange a conference call with Charles.  She uses her
   calendaring software (a CalDAV client) to publish her free-busy time
   to Charles.  Charles uses his calendaring software (also a CalDAV
   client) to fetch Beth's free-busy time.  Beth's calendar publisher
   requests some identity information of Charle's client.  It's provided
   from his identity agent and he is able to book a time for the call.

6.7.  NB7 - IMAP/POP3 and CalDAV

   At work Beth uses both calendaring (CalDAV) and email
   (IMAP,POP3,SMTP) clients to manage her time and messages.  Her
   identity agent authenticates her as owning the identifier that both
   clients use to identify her.  In this way she need only authenticate
   once to her identity agent instead of twice, once to each client.

6.8.  NB8 - RSS, Web, and CalDAV

   Beth works in a distributed workgroup collaborating with colleagues,
   individual contractors, and employees of partner companies.  The
   calendaring information she has access to is available via CalDAV,
   RSS, and HTTP/HTML.  Each of her software clients uses her identity
   agent to ensure she need only authenticate once, instead of once per
   client.
