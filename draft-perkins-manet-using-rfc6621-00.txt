      Using Layer 3 Multicast Suppression Protocols Above Layer 3
                draft-perkins-manet-using-rfc6621-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies how protocols operating at layers above layer
   3 can use the multicast suppression algorithms, for instance the
   algorithms specified in RFC 6621.

1.  Introduction

   Limiting the number of multicast forwarders provides performance
   benefits when used with a protocol that relies on flooding messages
   throughout a network.  Some good multicast suppression methods for
   limiting the number of multicast forwarders while maintaining
   complete network coverage are specified in RFC 6621 [RFC6621].
   Routing protocols that use multicast can offer much greater
   performance using multicast suppression algorithms.  Such algorithms
   do not affect the origination of multicast messages, but only
   determine whether a node needs to forward incoming multicast messages
   that are intended to flood the network.  Enabling performance
   benefits for reactive manet routing protocols was a strong motivating
   factor in the development and publication of RFC 6621.

   RFC 6621 multicast suppression algorithms are specified to operate at
   layer 3.  Manet routing protocols use RFC 5444 [RFC5444] as a message
   bundling layer; they operate above layer 3.  Such protocols specify
   that incoming multicast control messages have to be processed before
   regeneration; in other words, the incoming multicast message is not
   forwarded at all.  Manet control messages are sent with the IP
   destination address set to the link-local multicast address LL-MANET-
   Routers [RFC5498] unless otherwise specified.  This document
   specifies a way to use layer 3 multicast suppression algorithms at a
   layer above layer 3 so that algorithms that require network-wide
   flooding can reap the benefits of layer-3 multicast suppression
   algorithms.

2.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terminology:

   Forwarding Node
      A node that currently forwards incoming multicast messages to its
      neighbors, based on the results of running a multicast suppression
      algorithm.

   Multicast Suppression Algorithm

      An algorithm that determines which multicast routers are required
      for complete coverage of a multicast group; retransmission by
      other multicast routers for the multicast group is unnecessary.

   Regeneration
      Transmission of a message formed by processing and modification of
      an incoming message for an operation requiring the attention of
      members of a multicast group.

3.  Use of multicast suppression algorithms above Layer 3

   If the node is not currently a multicast forwarding node, then the
   node does not regenerate multicast messages even if the conditions
   for regeneration are satisfied.

   For example, if an AODVv2 [I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2] router is not
   currently a multicast forwarding node, then it does not regenerate
   multicast messages (e.g., RREQ or RERR) even if the conditions for
   regeneration are satisfied.  This restriction only applies for
   regeneration, and does not apply for multicast RREQ or RERR messages
   originated by the node.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.
