Abstract

   The merged ALTO protocol proposal proposes several mechanisms to
   increase scalability of the protocol.  One of the proposed mechanisms
   is the distribution of ALTO information directly between the peers
   without any involvement of the server.  This memo discusses why the
   proposed mechanism is considered harmful and why the proposed
   security framework is deployable.

Internet-Draft                    ALTO                       August 2009


1.  Introduction

   Scalabilty for the ALTO protocol is of major concern, as a single
   ALTO server potentially has to serve a large number of ALTO clients.
   The order of magnitude of how many clients will be served by a single
   ALTO server is not yet clear, but it can be expected that a single
   server must be able server a multiple of 10,000 clients
   simultaneously.  The merged ALTO protocol proposal
   [I-D.penno-alto-protocol] proposes several mechanisms to increase
   scalability of the protocol.  One of the proposed mechanisms is the
   distribution of ALTO information directly between the peers without
   any involvement of the server and any need to contact the server when
   having received the information.

   The next section explores why the proposal is considered harmful.

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  Considered Harmful

   Section 10.4 in [I-D.penno-alto-protocol] proposes this:

      It is possible for applications to redistribute ALTO information
      to improve scalability.  Even with such a distribution scheme,
      ALTO Clients obtaining ALTO information must be able to validate
      the received ALTO information to ensure that it was actually
      generated by the correct ALTO Server.  Further, to prevent the
      ALTO Server from being a target of attack, the verification scheme
      must not require ALTO Clients to contact the ALTO Server.

   This paragraph calls for the ability to distribute ALTO information
   obtained via the ALTO protocol directly between the peers (called
   applications in the above text) without any ALTO server involvement.
   This approach looks promising as it allows to reach more potential
   clients with the ALTO information.  However, there is no mean for the
   peers to verify whether the information provided is actually intended
   for their usage nor if the information is actually accurate at their
   current topological position in the Internet.

   For instance, peer A located in ISP1 obtains ALTO information from a
   peer B. Peer B is located in ISP2 and provides the information is has
   obtained from its local ALTO server.  Peer B and peer A do not have
   an easy way to determine whether they are located in the same ISP's
   network and thus they share ALTO information across ISP domains.
   Sharing of ALTO information across domains does not seem to be a
   natural goal of ALTO.  This is considered harmful, as ALTO
   information that is usual intended to be used within a single ISP is
   re-distributed.

   The draft proposes furthermore an assumed security solution that aims
   at preventing tampering with ALTO information:

      To fulfill these requirements, ALTO Information meant to be
      redistributable contains a digital signature which includes a hash
      of the ALTO information encrypted by the ALTO Server's private
      key.  The corresponding public key should either be part of the
      ALTO information itself, or it could be included in the interface
      descriptor.  The public key SHOULD include the hostname of the
      ALTO Server and it SHOULD be signed by a trusted authority.

   First of all does this require public/private key pair, where the
   public key is known to each peer and a trusted third party is
   required.  These requirements are possible to be fulfilled in certain
   deployments but are not in the general Internet deployment case,
   which in turn limits the applicability of this protocol.  Second, the
   receiving peer needs to contact the ALTO server at least once to

   obtain the public key part, or it does need to contact another server
   that provides the public key pair.

3.  Security Considerations

   This initial version of this memo does not yet have any security
   considerations, even though it tackles security issues.
