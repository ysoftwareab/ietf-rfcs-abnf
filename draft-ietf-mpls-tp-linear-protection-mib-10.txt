1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear
   Protection.

   This MIB module should be used for configuring and managing the MPLS-
   TP linear protection for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

   At the time of writing, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) SET
   is no longer recommended as a way to configure MPLS networks as was
   described in RFC 3812 [RFC3812].  However, since the MIB module
   specified in this document is intended to work in parallel with the

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB         October 2016


   MIB module for MPLS specified in [RFC3812], certain objects defined
   here are specified with MAX-ACCESS of read- write or read-create so
   that specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812] and the new MIB
   module in this document is consistent.  Although the example
   described in Section 7 specify means to configure OAM identifiers for
   MPLS-TP tunnels, this should be seen as indicating how the MIB values
   would be returned in the specified circumstances having been
   configured by alternative means.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed through the SNMP.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   RFC 6378 [RFC6378] defines the protocol to provide a linear
   protection switching mechanism for MPLS-TP with protection domain as
   a point-to-point LSP.  RFC 7271 [RFC7271] describes alternate
   mechanisms to perform some of the functions defined in [RFC6378], and
   also defines additional mechanisms, in order to provide operator
   control and experience that more closely models the behavior of
   linear protection seen in other transport networks.  Two modes are
   defined for MPLS-TP linear protection switching: Protection State
   Coordination (PSC) mode and Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode
   as specified in [RFC6378] and [RFC7271], respectively.  The detailed
   protocol specification of MPLS transport profile linear protection is
   described in [RFC6378] and [RFC7271].

   This document specifies a MIB module for the Label Edge Router (LER)
   that supports MPLS-TP linear protection as described in [RFC6378] and
   [RFC7271].  Objects defined in the document are generally applied to

   both PSC and APS modes.  If an object is valid for a particular mode
   only, it is noted in the description for the object.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The following new textual conventions are defined in this document:

      MplsLpsReq
      MplsLpsFpathPath
      MplsLpsCommand
      MplsLpsState

5.2.  The MPLS-TP Linear Protection Subtree

   MPLS-LPS-MIB is the MIB module defined in this document, and it is
   put under mplsStdMIB.

5.3.  The Notifications Subtree

   Notifications are defined to inform the management station about
   switchover, provisioning mismatches, and protocol failures of linear
   protection domain.  The following notifications are defined for this
   purpose:

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventSwitchover is to inform the
      management station about the switchover of the active path.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventRevertiveMismatch is to inform the
      management station about the provisioning mismatch in the
      revertive mode across the end point of the protection domain.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventProtecTypeMismatch is to inform the
      management station about the provisioning mismatch in protection
      type, representing both bridge and switching types, across the end
      point of the protection domain.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventCapabilitiesMismatch is to inform
      the management station about the provisioning mismatch in
      Capabilities TLVs across the end point of the protection domain.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventPathConfigMismatch is to inform the
      management station about the provisioning mismatch in the
      protection path configuration for PSC communication.

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB         October 2016


   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventFopNoResponse is to inform the
      management station about the failure of protocol due to a lack of
      response to a traffic switchover request in 50 ms.

   o  The notification, mplsLpsEventFopTimeout is to inform the
      management station about the failure of protocol due to no
      protocol message received during at least 3.5 times the long PSC
      message interval.

5.4.  The Table Structures

   The MPLS-TP linear protection MIB module has four tables.  The tables
   are as follows

   o  mplsLpsConfigTable

      This table is used to configure MPLS-TP linear protection domains.
      An MPLS-TP linear protection domain (or a protection domain) is
      identified by mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex.  A protection domain
      consists of two LERs and the working and protection paths that
      connect the two LERs.  The objects in this table are used to
      configure properties that are specific to the protection domain.
      Two Maintenance Entities (MEs) MUST be defined for each protection
      domain: one for the working path and the other for the protection
      path.  Therefore, two entries of the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, which
      is for configuring the MEs used in protection switching, are
      associated to one entry in this table.

   o  mplsLpsStatusTable

      This table provides the current status information of MPLS-TP
      linear protection domains that have been configured on the system.
      The entries of mplsLpsStatusTable have an AUGMENTS relationship
      with the entries of mplsLpsConfigTable.  When a protection domain
      is configured or deleted in the mplsLpsConfigTable, then the
      corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsStatusTable is,
      respectively, automatically created or deleted.

   o  mplsLpsMeConfigTable

      This table is used to associate MEs to the protection domain.
      Each protection domain requires two MEs.  One entry in the
      mplsLpsConfigTable is associated with two entries in this table:
      one for the working path and the other for the protection path of
      the protection domain.  The mplsLpsMeConfigPath object in this
      table indicates that the path is either working or protection.
      The ME is identified by mplsOamIdMegIndex, mplsOamIdMeIndex and
      mplsOamIdMeMpIndex, which are the same index values as the entry



Kingston Smiler Selvaraj,Expires April 15, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB         October 2016


      in the mplsOamIdMeTable defined in RFC 7697 [RFC7697].  The
      relationship with the mplsOamIdMeTable is described in
      Section 6.1.

   o  mplsLpsMeStatusTable

      This table provides the current information about protection
      status of MEs that have been configured on the system.  When an ME
      configured or deleted in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, then the
      corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsMeStatusTable is,
      respectively, automatically created or deleted.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the MPLS OAM Maintenance Identifiers MIB Module

   Entries in the mplsOamIdMeTable [RFC7697] are extended by entries in
   the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.  Note that the nature of the 'extends'
   relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the
   mplsLpsMeConfigTable has the same index values as the entry in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable.  Each time that an entry is created in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable for which the LER supports MPLS-TP linear
   protection, a row is created automatically in the
   mplsLpsMeConfigTable.

   When a point-to-point transport path needs to be monitored, one ME is
   needed for the path and one entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable will be
   created.  But, the ME entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable may or may not
   participate in protection switching.  If an ME participates in
   protection switching, an entry in mplsLpsMeConfigTable MUST be
   created, and the objects in the entry indicates which protection
   domain this ME belongs to and whether this ME is for either working
   path or protection path.  If the ME does not participate in
   protection switching, an entry in mplsLpsMeConfigTable does not need
   to be created.

7.  Example of Protection Switching Configuration

   This example considers the protection domain configuration on an LER
   to provide protection for a co-routed bidirectional MPLS tunnel.  For
   the working and protection paths of the protection domain, two
   Maintenance Entity Groups (MEGs) need to be configured and each MEG
   contains one ME for a point-to-point transport path.  For more
   information on mplsOamIdMegTable and mplsOamIdMeTable, see [RFC7697].

   In mplsOamIdMegTable:
   {
      -- MEG index (Index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
      -- MEG name
      mplsOamIdMegName                  = "MEG1",
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
      mplsOamIdMegRowStatus             = createAndGo (4)
   }

   }

   This will create two MEG entres in the mplsOamIdMegTable.

   The following ME table is used to associate the ME information to
   each MEG.

   }

   The following table configures a protection domain.

   In mplsLpsConfigTable:
   mplsLpsConfigEntry ::= SEQUENCE
   {
      -- Protection Domain index (Index to the table)
      mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex  = 3,

      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
      mplsLpsConfigRowStatus   = createAndGo (4)

          1+1
          In the 1+1 protection scheme, a fully dedicated protection
          path is allocated. Data traffic is copied and fed
          at the source to both the working and the protection path.
          The traffic on the working and the protection paths is
          transmitted simultaneously to the sink of the protection
          domain, where selection between the working and protection
          paths is performed

          1:1
          In the 1:1 scheme, a protection path is allocated to
          protect against a defect, failure, or a degradation in the
          working path. In normal conditions, data traffic is
          transmitted over the working path, while the protection path
          functions in the idle state. If there is a defect on the
          working path or a specific administrative request,
          traffic is switched to the protection path.

          bidirectional
          In bidirectional protection scheme, both the directions
          will be switched simultaneously even if the fault applies
          to only one direction of the path.

          unidirectional
          In unidirectional protection scheme protection switching
          will be performed independently for each direction of a
          bidirectional transport path.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some networks in
   a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.  These are the tables and
   objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mplsLpsConfigTable is used to configure MPLS-TP linear protection
      domains.  Improper manipulation of the objects in this table may
      result in different behaviors than network operators have
      originally intended, such as delaying traffic switching or causing
      a race condition with server layer protection after network
      failure (mplsLpsConfigHoldOff), delaying or speeding up reversion
      after recovering network failure (mplsLpsConfigWaitToRestore),
      unexpected traffic switching (mplsLpsConfigCommand), or
      discontinuance of operation of a protection switching control
      process (mplsLpsConfigMode, mplsLpsConfigProtectionType).

   o  mplsLpsMeConfigTable is used to assign each ME either working or
      protection path.  Improper manipulation of this object may result
      in discontinuance of operation of a protection switching control
      process.

   o  In the case of the discontinuance of a protection switching
      control process, network operators will be notified.  However, the
      notification is controlled by mplsLpsNotificationEnable object,
      which is read-write.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mplsLpsStatusTable and mplsLpsMeStatusTable collectively show the
      history and current status of the MPLS-TP linear protection



Kingston Smiler Selvaraj,Expires April 15, 2017                [Page 40]

Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB         October 2016


      domains.  They can be used to estimate the performances and
      qualities of the network being operated with the MPLS-TP linear
      protection.  If an administrator does not want to reveal this
      information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/
      vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   RFC 3414 [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm RFC 3826 [RFC3826].
   Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
   Model (TSM) RFC 5591 [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport
   such as SSH RFC 5592 [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS RFC 6353 [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not
   recommended.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for the MIB module from the "MIB
   Transmission Group - MPLS STD" sub-registry of the "Internet-standard
   MIB - Transmission Group" registry for the MPLS Linear Protection MIB
   module specified in this document.

11.  Acknowledgments

   The authors wish to thank Joan Cucchiara for her review as MIB
   Doctor, Joan's detailed comments were of great help for improving the
   quality of this document.
