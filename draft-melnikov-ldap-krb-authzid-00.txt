Abstract

   This document defines new LDAP authorization identity syntax for
   Kerberos-aware Directories.


1.    Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].


2.    Authorization Identity Syntax for Kerberos


   This document defines a new LDAP [LDAP] authorization identity syntax
   for Directories that support Kerberos V5 [KERBEROS]. For example, an
   LDAP server that implements SASL GSSAPI [SASL-GSSAPI] mechanism may
   also support the new syntax defined below.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].  Non-terminals referenced
   but not defined below are as defined by [AUTHMECH], [KERBEROS] and
   [UTF-8].

   authzId               =/ krbAuthzId

   KRBCOLON              = %x6B %x72 %x62 %x3a ; "krb:"

   krbAuthzId            = KRBCOLON krbPrincipal
                           ; kerberos-principal-name-based authorization id.

   krbRealmDelimiter     = %x40
                           ; '@'

   krbComponentDelimiter = %x2F
                           ; '/'

   krbPrincipal          = krbNameComponents [krbRealmDelimiter krbRealm]

   krbNameComponents     = krbNameComponent *(krbComponentDelimiter krbNameComponent)

   krbNameComponent      = KerberosString ; *UTF8
                           ; This corresponds to individual "name-string" of
                           ; "PrincipalName" as defined in [KERBEROS].
                           ;
                           ; '/', '\' and '@' characters must be escaped by

                           ; prefixing with \, i.e. "\@"

   krbRealm              = KerberosString ; *UTF8
                           ; This corresponds to "Realm" as defined in [KERBEROS]
                           ; The syntax is constrained as described in section 6
                           ; of [KERBEROS]
                           ;
                           ; '/', '\' and '@' characters must be escaped by
                           ; prefixing with \, i.e. "\@"

   The krbAuthzId choice allows a client to assert an authorization
   identity of a Kerberos principal when the client doesn't know a
   corresponding distinguished name for the asserted identity. A
   krbAuthzId is prefixed with a unique prefix "krb:" which is followed
   by a Kerberos principal (krbPrincipal).  krbPrincipal consists of one
   or more components (components of "name-string" [KERBEROS]) that form
   a principal name followed by an optional Kerberos realm (krbRealm).
   <<Add an example?>> Before constructing a krbPrincipal each principal
   name component and the realm MUST be prepared using the "SASLPrep"
   profile [SASLPrep] of the "stringprep" algorithm [RFC3454].

   <<Is there a KerberosPrep or does Kerberos use SASLPrep?>>


   All the krbNameComponent elements are delimited by the '/' character.
   The principal name components are separated from the realm by the '@'
   character.  Because of the special meaning of the '/' and the '@' as
   the delimiters, they are not allowed to be unescaped if used inside
   of krbNameComponent (see Section 6.2 of [KERBEROS] for an example) or
   krbRealm.  The '\' character is used as the escape character. The '\'
   itself has to be escaped.

   Note that it is a typical for Kerberos/GSSAPI implementations to use


   <<An alternative proposal: All the krbNameComponent elements and the
   realm are separated by Unicode ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE character
   encoded in UTF-8 (%xEF %xBB %xBF).  The ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE was
   selected as the delimiter character, as it never appears in any
   SASLPrep output.

   An alternative delimiter character: SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD)

   Advantage of the proposal: no escaping mechanism required.
   Disadvantage of the proposal: not easy way to type krbAuthzId on a
   command line.  >>

   <<Describe how comparison is to be performed. For the realm part it
   may or may not be ASCII case sensitive. This is mostly implementation
   dependent, for example not all implementations support X500 syntax
   for realms. Some implementations may assume that a realm is a domain
   and treat it case insensitively. The principal name part is
   implementation dependent.>>

   Note, that name-type element of PrincipalName [KERBEROS] is not being
   used in krbPrincipal.

   This document doesn't mandate how an LDAP server performs internal
   mapping of a krbPrincipal to the corresponding distinguished name.
   For example, an implementation may choose to do an algorithmic
   mapping ("user1@EXAMPLE.COM" ==> "cn=user1, dc=EXAMPLE, dc=COM"), or
   perform a search based mapping.  The client may use LDAP "Who am I?"
   Extended Operation [WHO-AM-I] to discover the resulting distinguished
   name.
