1.  Introduction

   The US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is rolling out 
   their Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architecture at this 
   time.  This network will require more Resource-Priority header (RPH)
   namespaces than were defined, and IANA registered, in RFC 4412 
   [RFC4412].  The purpose of this document is to define these 
   additional namespaces.  Each will be RFC 4412 defined preemption 
   based in nature, and will have the same 5 priority-values.  

   One aspect within DISA's network will be to allow a session or call 
   to only preempt another call established with the same 
   Resource-Priority header namespace, but no other namespace.

   In other words, messages with a namespace of dsn-X may only 
   have their RPH priority-values compared for preferential treatment 
   to other dsn-X namespaces, and not any other namespaces, unless
   two or more (complete) namespaces are considered to be equivalent, 
   as defined in section 8 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412].  

   This is all a matter of local policy.  However, this policy is a 
   known requirement from DISA to support moving forward.

2.  New RPH Namespaces Created

   The following 50 SIP Resource Priority header namespaces are created
   by this document:

      dsn-00000D      dsn-00001D      dsn-00002D                  
      dsn-00000E      dsn-00001E      dsn-00002E                  
      dsn-00000F      dsn-00001F      dsn-00002F                  

   Each namespace listed above will have the same 5 priority-levels:

      .0 (lowest priority)
      .2 
      .4 
      .6 
      .8 (highest priority)

   A namespace from the above list will not be considered for 
   preferential treatment over another namespace unless local policy 
   has configured a SIP entity processing two messages (each with 
   different namespaces) as being equivalent (see section 8 of RFC 4412
   [RFC4412] for this detailed).

   The reality of this is, a message (or a call) with the following 
   Resource-Priority header value: 

      dsn-000001.8

   for example, will not have any preferential treatment over a 
   message, for example, with this Resource-Priority header value:

      dsn-000010.0

   because they are two difference namespaces.

   The dash '-' character is just like any other character, and is not 
   to be considered a delimiter in any official way within any 
   namespace here.  This MAY change in future efforts.

   As stated in Section 9 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412], an IANA registered 
   namespace SHOULD NOT change the number, and MUST NOT change the 
   relative priority order, of its assigned priority-values.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within RFC 4412 [RFC4412], this is 
   a Standards-Track document registering new SIP Resource-Priority 
   header namespaces, and their associated priority-values and intended
   algorithms.


3.1 IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration 

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" registry in the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following table lists the new 
   RPH namespaces registered by this document (NOTE: 'RFCXXXX' is to be
   replaced by this document's RFC number if this document is published
   by the RFC-Editor):

3.2  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the "Resource-Priority Priority-values" registry in the sip-
   parameters section of IANA, the list of priority-values for each of

   prioritized least to greatest, is registered by the following:
