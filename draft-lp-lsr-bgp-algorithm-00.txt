1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] proposes a solution that allows IGPs
   themselves to compute constraint-based paths over the SR network.
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-ip-flexalgo] allows flex-algo to be deployed in any IP
   network, even in the absence of SR-MPLS and SRv6.

   However, the algorithm-based path can only be used in the IGP domain.
   In the BGP-based inter-domain scenario, end-to-end path based on
   algorithms cannot be supported.

   This document proposes extensions to BGP to support algorithm-based
   end-to-end path establishment.

                  Figure 2: Algo-based Inter-domain Path

   As shown in Figure 2, node 8 is configured with two loopback
   addresses, loopback-1 and loopback-2, they belong to the flex-algo
   128 plane and the flex-algo 129 plane respectively.  In IGP domain 2,

Internet-Draft              Algorithm in BGP                  March 2021


   the routes to loopback-1 will be generated on the nodes (e.g, node
   5,6,8) in the Flex-algo 128 plane and the routes to loopback-2 will
   be generated on the nodes (e.g, node 5,7,8) in the Flex-algo 129
   plane.

   Node 5 can advertise prefix loopback-1 and prefix loopback-2 to node
   4 through BGP[RFC2545][RFC4271].  Node 4 can import the BGP routes
   into IGP and continue to advertise the routes to its neighbors in IGP
   domain1.  Or, node 4 directly advertises the routes to node 1 through
   BGP.

   In both cases, the corresponding algorithm information from IGP
   domain2 is lost during the advertisement.  As a result, node 4 does
   not know which Flex-algo plane to import loopback-1 or loopback-2
   into IGP domain 1.

   With the Algorithm Extended Community, the algorithm information can
   be carried in the BGP route of loopbacks advertised from node 5 to
   node 4.

   The administrator can configure algorithms in each IGP domain in the
   network.  A simple configuration method is that algorithms in each
   IGP domain are consistent.  If the algorithm configurations in each
   IGP domain are inconsistent, the ASBR needs to know the mapping
   relationship of the algorithms and carry the converted algorithm
   information in Algorithm Extended Community when advertising the BGP
   route.

   A BGP speaker can advertise multiple paths for the same address
   prefix, each path is identified by a Path Identifier in addition to
   the address prefix [RFC7911].  By leveraging add-path, multiple
   loopbacks on the egress node can be avoided.

   Same approach is applicable for BGP Prefix SID advertisement[RFC8669]
   and BGP Labeled Unicast(BGP-LU)[RFC8227].  If any Router Reflector
   existed in the network, it SHOULD support this new Extended
   Community.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the sub-type TBA1 for "Algorithm
   Extended Community" under the "BGP Transitive Opaque Extended
   Community"
