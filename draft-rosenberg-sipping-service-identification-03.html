<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document considers the problem of service
	    identification in the Session Initiation Protocol
	    (SIP). Service identification is the process of 
	    determining the user-level use case that is driving the
	    signaling being utilized by the user agent. While
	    seemingly simple, this process is quite complex, and when
	    not addressed properly, can lead to fraud,
	    interoperability problems, and stifling of
	    innovation. This document discusses these problems and
	    makes recommendations on how to address them.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defines
mechanisms for initiating and managing communications sessions between
agents. SIP allows for a broad array of session types between
agents. It can manage audio sessions, ranging from low bitrate voice-only up to
multi-channel hi fidelity music. It can manage video sessions, ranging
from small, "talking-head" style video chat, up to high definition
multipoint video conferencing, to low bandwidth user-generated
content, up to high definition movie and TV content. SIP endpoints can
be anything - adaptors that convert an old analog telephone to Voice
over IP (VoIP), dedicated hardphones, fancy hardphones with rich
displays and user entry capabilities, softphones on a PC, buddylist
and presence applications on a PC, dedicated videoconferencing
peripherals, and speakerphones.

</p>
<p>
This breadth of applicability is SIPs greatest asset, but it also
introduces numerous challenges. One of these is that, when an endpoint
generates a SIP INVITE for a session, or receives one, that session
can potentially be within the context of any number of different use
cases and endpoint types. For example, a SIP INVITE with a single
audio stream could represent a Push-To-Talk session between mobile
devices, a VoIP session between softphones, or audio-based access to
stored content on a server.

</p>
<p>
These differing use cases have driven implementors and system
designers to seek techniques for service identification. Service
identification is the process of determining and/or signaling the
specific use case that is driving the signaling being generated by a
user agent. At first glance, this seems harmless and easy enough. It
is tempting to define a new header, "Service-ID", for example, and
have a user agent populate it with any number of well-known tokens
which define what the service is. This information could then be
consumed for any number of purposes.

</p>
<p>
However, as this document will demonstrate, service identification is
a very complex and difficult process, and can very easily lead to
fraud, systemic interoperability failures, and a complete stifling of
the innovation that SIP was meant to achieve. 

</p>
<p>
<a class='info' href='#sec-defs'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Services and Service Identification</span><span>)</span></a> begins by defining a service and the service
identification problem. <a class='info' href='#sec-examples'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example Services</span><span>)</span></a> gives some
concrete examples of services and why they can be challenging to
identify. <a class='info' href='#sec-use'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using Service Identification</span><span>)</span></a> explores the ways in which a
service identification can be utilized within a network. Next, <a class='info' href='#sec-key'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Key Principles of Service Identification</span><span>)</span></a> discusses the key architectural principles of
service identification, and how explicit service identifiers can lead
to fraud, interoperability failures, and stifling of service
innovation.

Services and Service Identification</h3>

<p>
The problem of identifying services within SIP is not a
new one. The problem has been considered extensively in the context of
presence. In particular, the presence data model for SIP <a class='info' href='#RFC4479'>[RFC4479]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;A Data Model for Presence,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> defines the concept of a service as one of the core
notions that presence describes. Services are described in Section 3.3
of RFC 4479, which has this to say on the topic:

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>

3.3.  Service

   Each presentity has access to a number of services.  Each of these
   represents a point of reachability for communications that can be
   used to interact with the user.  Examples of services are telephony
   (that is, traditional circuit-based telephone service), push-to-talk,
   instant messaging, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia
   Message Service (MMS).

   It is difficult to give a precise definition for service.  One
   reasonable approach is to model each software or hardware agent in
   the system as a service.  If a user starts a softphone application on
   their PC, then that represents a service.  If a user has a videophone
   device, then that represents another service.  This is effectively a
   physical view of services.  This definition, however, starts to fall
   apart when a service is spread across multiple software agents or
   devices.  For example, a SIP URI representing an address-of-record
   can be routed to a softphone or a videophone, or both.  In that case,
   one might attempt instead to define a service based on its address on
   the network.  This definition also falls apart when modeling devices
   or applications that receive calls and dispatch them to different
   "helpers" based on potentially complex logic.  For example, a
   cellular telephone might house multiple SIP applications, each of
   which can "register" different handlers based on the method or even
   body type of the request.  Each of those applications or handlers can
   rightfully be considered a service, but it doesn't have an address on
   the network distinct from the others.

   Because of this inherent difficulty in precisely defining a service,
   the data model doesn't try to constrain what can be considered a
   service.  Rather, anything can be considered a service so long as it
   exhibits a set of key properties defined by this model.  In
   particular, each service is associated with characteristics that
   identify the nature and capabilities of that service, with reach
   information that indicates how to connect to the service, with status
   information representing the state of that service, and relative
   information that describes the ways in which that service relates to
   others associated with the presentity.

   As a consequence, in this model, services are not explicitly
   enumerated.  There is no central registry where one finds identifiers
   for each service.  Consequently, each service does not have a single
   "service" attribute with values such as "ptt" or "telephony".  That
   doesn't mean that these consolidated monikers aren't useful; indeed,
   they represent an essential summary of what the service is.  Such
   summarization is useful in creating icons that allow a user to choose
   one service over another.  A watcher is free to create such
   summarization information from any of the information associated with
   a service.  The reach information often provides valuable information
   for creating such a summarization.  Oftentimes, the scheme of the URI
   is synonymous with the view of what a service is.  An "sms" URI [14]
   clearly indicates SMS, for example.  For some URIs, there may be many
   services available, for example, SIP or tel [15], in which case the
   scheme is less meaningful as a way of creating a summary.  The reach
   information could also indicate that certain application software has
   to be invoked (such as a videogame), in which case that aspect of the
   reach information would be useful for generating an iconic
   representation of the game.

</pre></div>
<p>
Essentially, the service is the user-visible use case that is driving
the behavior of the user-agents and servers in the SIP
network. Being user-visible means that there is a difference in
user experience between two services that are different. That user
experience can be part of the call, or outside of the call. Within a
call, the user
experience can be based on different media types (an audio call vs. a
video chat), different content within a particular media type (stored
content, such as a movie or TV session), different devices (a wireless
device for "telephony" vs. a PC application for "voice-chat"),
different user interfaces (a buddy list view of voice on a PC
application vs. a software emulation of a hard phone), different
communities that can be accessed (voice chat with other users that
have the same voice chat client, vs. voice communications with any
endpoint on the PSTN), or different applications that are invoked by
the user (manually selecting a push-to-talk application from a
wireless phone vs. a telephony application). Outside of a call, the
difference in user experience can be a billing one (cheaper for one
service than other), a notification feature for one and not another
(for example, an IM that gets sent whenever a user makes a call), and
so on. 

</p>
<p>
In some cases, there is very little difference in the underlying
technology that will support two different services, and in other
cases, there are big differences. However, for purposes of this
discussion, the key definition is that two services are distinct when
there is a perceived difference by the user in the two services. 

</p>
<p>
This leads naturally to the desire to perform service
identification. Service identification is defined as the process of
(1) determination of the underlying service which is driving a
particular signaling exchange, (2) associating that service with some
kind of moniker, and (3) attaching that moniker to a signaling message
(typically a SIP INVITE), and then utilizing it for various purposes
within the network. Service identification can be done in the
endpoints, in which case the UA would insert the moniker directly into
the signaling message based on its awareness of the service. Or, it
can be done within a proxy in the network, based on inspection of the
SIP message, or based on hints placed into the message by the user.

It is very useful to consider several example services, especially
ones that appear difficult to differentiate from each other.

IPTV vs. Multimedia</h3>

<p>
IP Television (IPTV) is the usage of IP networks to access traditional
television content, such as movies and shows. SIP can be utilized to
establish a session to a media server in a network, which then serves
up multimedia content and streams it as an audio and video stream
towards the client. Whether SIP is ideal for IPTV is, in itself, a
good question. However, such a discussion is outside the scope of this
document. 

</p>
<p>
Consider multimedia conferencing. The user accesses a voice and video
conference at a conference server. The user might join in listen-only
mode, in which case the user receives audio and video streams, but
does not send.

</p>
<p>
These two services - IPTV and multimedia conferencing, clearly appear
as different services. They have different user experiences and
applications. A user is unlikely to ever be confused about whether a
session is IPTV or multimedia conferencing. Indeed, they are likely to
have different software applications or endpoints for the two
services. 

</p>
<p>
However, these two services look remarkably alike based on the
signaling. Both utilize audio and video. Both could utilize the same
codecs. Both are unidirectional streams (from a server in the network
to the client). Thus, it would appear on the surface that there is no
way to differentiate them, based on inspection of the signaling
alone.

Gaming vs. Voice Chat</h3>

<p>
Consider an interactive game, played between two users from their
mobile devices. The game involves the users sending each other game
moves, using a messaging channel, in addition to voice. In another
service, users have a voice and IM chat conversation using a buddy
list application on their PC.

</p>
<p>
In both services, there are two media streams - audio and
messaging. The audio uses the same codecs. Both use the Message
Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-simple-message-sessions'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;simple&#8209;message&#8209;sessions]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Campbell, B., &ldquo;The Message Session Relay Protocol,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. In both cases, the caller
would send an INVITE to the AOR of the target user. However, these
represent fairly different services, in terms of user experience.

Configuration vs. Pager Messaging</h3>

<p>
The SIP MESSAGE method <a class='info' href='#RFC3428'>[RFC3428]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Campbell, B., Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Huitema, C., and D. Gurle, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant Messaging,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> provides a way to send
one-shot messages to a particular AOR. This specification is primarily
aimed at Short Message Service (SMS) style messaging, commonly found
in wireless phones. Receipt of a MESSAGE request would cause the
messaging application on a phone to launch, allowing the user to
browse message history and respond. 

</p>
<p>
However, MESSAGE is sometimes used for the delivery of content to a
device for other purposes. For example, some providers use it to
deliver configuration updates, such as new phone settings or
parameters, or to indicate that a new version of firmware is
available. Though not designed for this purpose, MESSAGE gets used
since, in existing wireless networks, SMS are used for this purpose,
and MESSAGE is the SIP equivalent of SMS.

</p>
<p>
Consequently, the MESSAGE request sent to a phone can be for two
different services. One would require invocation of a messaging app,
whereas the other would be consumed by the software in the phone,
without any user interaction at all.

Application Invocation in the User Agent</h3>

<p>
In some of the examples above, there were multiple software
applications running within a single user agent. When an incoming
INVITE or MESSAGE arrives, it must be delivered to the appropriate
application software. When each service is bound to a distinct
software application, it would seem that the service identity is
needed to dispatch the message to the appropriate piece of
software. This is shown in <a class='info' href='#fig-model'>Figure&nbsp;1</a>.

<p>
The role of the SIP layer is to parse incoming messages, handle the
SIP state machinery for transactions and dialogs, and then dispatch
request to the appropriate service. For the example services in <a class='info' href='#sec-ex-game'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gaming vs. Voice Chat</span><span>)</span></a>, an incoming INVITE for the gaming service
would be delivered to the gaming application software. An incoming
INVITE for the voice chat service would be delivered to the voice chat
application software. For the examples in <a class='info' href='#sec-ex-config'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Configuration vs. Pager Messaging</span><span>)</span></a>, a MESSAGE request for user to user messaging
would be delivered to the messaging or SMS app, and a MESSAGE request
containing configuration data would be delivered to a configuration
update application.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Application Invocation in the Network</h3>

<p>
Another usage of a service identifier would be to cause servers in the
SIP network to provide additional processing, based on the
service. For example, an INVITE issued by a user agent for IPTV would
pass through a server that does some kind of content rights
management, authorizing whether the user is allowed to access that
content. On the other hand, an INVITE issued by a user for multimedia
conferencing would pass through a server providing "traditional"
telephony features, such as outbound call screening and call
recording. It would make no sense for the INVITE associated with IPTV
to have outbound call screening and call recording applied, and it
would make no sense for the multimedia conferencing INVITE to be
processed by the content rights management server. Indeed, in these
cases, its not just an efficiency issue (invoking servers when not
needed), but rather, truly incorrect behavior can occur. For example,
if an outbound call screening application is set to block outbound
calls to everything except for the phone numbers of friends and
family, an IPTV request that gets processed by such a server would be
blocked (as its not targeted to the AOR of a friend or family
member). This would block a user's attempt to access IPTV services,
when that was not the goal at all.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, a MESSAGE request from <a class='info' href='#sec-ex-config'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Configuration vs. Pager Messaging</span><span>)</span></a> might
need to pass through a message server for filtering when it is
associated with chat, but not when it is associated with
config. Consider a filter which gets applied to MESSAGE requests, and
that filter runs in a server in the network. The filter operation
prevents user Joe from sending messages to user Bob that contain the
words "stock" or "purchase", due to some regulations that disallow Joe
and Bob from discussing stock trading. However, a MESSAGE for
configuration purposes might contain an XML document that uses the
token "stock" as some kind of attribute. This configuration update
would be discarded by the filtering server, when it should not have
been.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;
Network Quality of Service Authorization</h3>

<p>
The IP network can provide differing levels of Quality of Service
(QoS) to IP packets. This service can include guaranteed throughput,
latency, or loss characteristics. Typically, the user agent will make
some kind of QoS request, either using explicit signaling protocols
(such as RSVP) or through marking of Diffserv value in
packets. The network will need to make a policy decision based on
whether these QoS treatments are authorized or not. One common
authorization policy is to check if the user has invoked a service
using SIP that they are authorized to invoke, and that this service
requires the level of QoS treatment the user has requested.

</p>
<p>
For example, consider IPTV and multimedia conferencing as described in
<a class='info' href='#sec-ex-iptv'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>IPTV vs. Multimedia</span><span>)</span></a>. IPTV is a non-real time
service. Consequently, media traffic for IPTV would be authorized for
bandwidth guarantees, but not for latency or loss guarantees. On the
other hand, multimedia conferencing is real time. Its traffic would
require bandwidth, loss and latency guarantees from the network.

</p>
<p>
Consequently, if a user should make an RSVP reservation for a media
stream, and ask for latency guarantees for that stream, the network
would like to be able to authorize it if the service was multimedia
conferencing, but not if it was IPTV. This would require the server
performing the QoS authorization to know the service associated with
the INVITE that set up the session.

Service Authorization</h3>

<p>
Frequently, a network administrator will want to authorize whether a
user is allowed to invoke a particular service. Not all users will be
authorized to use all services that are provided. For example, a user
may not be authorized to access IPTV services, whereas they are
authorized to utilize multimedia processing. A user might not be able
to utilize a multiplayer gaming service, whereas they are authorized
to utilize voice chat services. 

</p>
<p>
Consequently, when an INVITE arrives at a proxy in the network, the
proxy will need to determine what the requested service is, so that
the proxy can make an authorization decision.

Accounting and Billing</h3>

<p>
Service authorization and accounting/billing go hand in
hand. Presumably, one of the primary reasons for authorizing that a
user can utilize a service is that they are being billed differently
based on the type of service. Consequently, one of the goals of a
service identity is to be able to include it in accounting records, so
that the appropriate billing model can be applied. 

</p>
<p>
For example, in the case of IPTV, a service provider can bill based on
the content (US $5 per movie, perhaps), whereas for multimedia
conferencing, they can bill by the minute. This requires the
accounting streams to indicate which service was invoked for the
particular session.

Negotiation of Service</h3>

<p>
In some cases, when the caller initiates a session, they don't
actually know which service will be utilized. Rather, they might like
to offer up all of the services they have available to the called
party, and then let the called party decide, or let the system make a
decision based on overlapping service capabilities.

</p>
<p>
As an example, s user can do both the game and the voice chat service
of <a class='info' href='#sec-ex-game'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gaming vs. Voice Chat</span><span>)</span></a>. They initiate a session to a target
AOR, but the devices used by that user can only support voice
chat. Consequently, voice chat gets utilized for the session.

Dispatch to Devices</h3>

<p>
When a user has multiple devices, each with varying capabilities in
terms of service, it is useful to dispatch an incoming request to the
right device based on whether the device can support the service that
has been requested.

</p>
<p>
For example, if a user initiates a gaming session with voice chat, and
the target user has two devices - one that can support the gaming
service, and the other that cannot, the INVITE should be dispatched to
the device which supports the gaming session.

Key Principles of Service Identification</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Services are a By-Product of Signaling</h3>

<p>
Almost always, the first solution that people consider is to add some
kind of field to the signaling messages which indicates what the
service is. This field would then be inserted by the user agent, and
then can be used by the proxies and other user agent as a service
identifier. 

</p>
<p>
This approach, however, misses a key point, which cannot be stressed
enough, and which represents the core architectural principle to be
understood here:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A service is the by-product of the signaling and the context around
  it (the user profile, time-of-day and so on) - the effects of the
  signaling message once launched into the network. The service
  identity is therefore always derivable from the signaling and its
  context without additional identifiers.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When a user sends an INVITE request to the network, and targets that
request at an IPTV server, and includes SDP for audio and video
streaming, the *result* of sending such an INVITE is that an IPTV
session occurs. The entire purpose of the INVITE is to establish such
a session, and therefore, invoke the service. Thus, a service is not
something that is different from the rest of the signaling message. A
service is what the user gets after the network and other user agents
have processed a signaling message. 

</p>
<p>
This principle leads to another important conclusion:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
If two services are different, but their signaling appears to be the
same, it is because there is in fact something different that has been
overlooked, or something has been implied from the signaling which
should have been signaled explicitly.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes sense; if a service is the byproduct of signaling, how can
a user have different experiences and different services when the
signaling message is the same? There has to be something different in
the messages, if the user experience was in fact different.

</p>
<p>
To illustrate this, let us take each of the example services in <a class='info' href='#sec-examples'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example Services</span><span>)</span></a> and investigate whether there is, or should
be, something different in the signaling in each case.

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>IPTV vs. Multimedia Conferencing:</dt>
<dd> The two services in
<a class='info' href='#sec-ex-iptv'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>IPTV vs. Multimedia</span><span>)</span></a> appear to have identical signaling. They
both involve audio and video streams, both of which are
unidirectional. Both might utilize the same codecs. However, there is
another important difference in the signaling - the target URI. In the
case of IPTV, the request is targeted at a media server or to a
particular piece of content to be viewed. In the case of multimedia
conferencing, the target is a conference server. The administrator of
the domain can therefore examine the two Request-URI, and figure out
whether it is targeted for a conference server or a content server,
and use that to derive the service associated with the request.

</dd>
<dt>Gaming vs. Voice Chat:</dt>
<dd> Though both sessions involve
MSRP and voice, and both are targeted to the same AOR of the called
user, there is a difference. The MSRP messages for the gaming session
carry content which is game specific, whereas the MSRP messages for
the voice chat are just regular text, meant for rendering to a
user. Thus, the MSRP session in the SDP will indicate the specific
content type that MSRP is carrying, and this type will differ in both
cases. Even if the game moves look like text, since they are being
consumed by an automata there is an underlying schema that dictates
their content, and therefore, this schema represents the actual
content type that should be signaled.

</dd>
<dt>Configuration vs. Pager Messaging:</dt>
<dd> Just as in the case
of gaming vs. voice chat, the content type of the messages
differentiates the service that occurs as a consequence of the
messages. 

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
This is ultimately an expression of the principle of DWIM vs. DWIS
(Do-What-I-Mean vs. Do-What-I-Say). Explicit signaling is DWIS - the
user is asking for a service by invoking the signaling that results in
the desired effect. A service identifier is DWIM - an unspecific
request for something that is ill-defined and non-interoperable.

Perils of Explicit Identifiers</h3>

<p>
Given that the information in the signaling message always conveys
enough information to identify the service, another important
conclusion can be drawn:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Inclusion of an explicit service identifier within a message is, at
best, redundant, and at worst, an avenue for fraud, loss of
interoperability, and stifling of service innovation.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By "explicit service identifier", we mean a field included in the
signaling message that contains a token whose value indicates the
specific service invoked by the calling user. This would be "IPTV" or
"voice chat" or "shoot-em game" or "short message service". This
explicit identifier would typically be inserted by the originating
user agent, and carried in the signaling message.

</p>
<p>
Clearly, if the signaling message itself contains enough information
to identify the service, inclusion of an extra field to say the same
thing is going to be redundant. Redundancy by itself is not a big
deal. However, redundancy can lead to other,more significant
problems.

<a name="rfc.section.6.2.1"></a><h3>6.2.1.&nbsp;
Fraud</h3>

<p>
First and foremost, it can lead to
fraud. If a provider uses the service identifier for billing and
accounting purposes, or for authorization purposes, it opens an avenue
for attack. The user can construct the signaling message so that its
actual effect (which is the service the user will receive), is what
the user desires, but the service identity (which is what is used for
billing and authorization) doesn't match, and indicates a cheaper
service, or one that the user is authorized to receive. If, however,
the service identity used by the domain admistrator is derived from
the signaling itself, the user cannot lie. If they did lie, they
wouldn't get the desired service. 

</p>
<p>
Consider the example of IPTV vs. multimedia conferencing. If
multimedia conferencing is cheaper, the user could send an INVITE for
an IPTV session, but include a service identifier which indicates
multimedia conferencing. They get the service associated with IPTV,
but at the cost of multimedia conferencing.

</p>
<p>
This same principle shows up in other places. For example, in the
identification of an emergency services call <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B., Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and A. Newton, &ldquo;Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet Multimedia,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. It is desirable to give emergency
services calls special treatment, such as being free, authorized even
when the user cannot otherwise make calls, and to give them
priority. If emergency calls where indicated through something other
than the target of the call being an emergency services URN <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;service&#8209;urn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, it would open an avenue for
fraud. The user could place any desired URI in the request-URI, and
indicate that the call is an emergency services call. This could would
then get special treatment, but of course get routed to the target
URI. The only way to prevent this fraud is to consider an emergency
call as any call whose target is an emergency services URN. Thus, the
service identification here is based on the target of the
request. When the target is an emergency services URN, the request can
get special treatment. The user cannot lie, since there is no way to
separately indicate this is an emergency call, besides targeting it to
an emergency URN.

Systematic Interoperability Failures</h3>

<p>
How can inclusion of an explicit service identifier cause loss of
interoperability? When such an identifier is used to drive
functionality - such as dispatch on the phones, in the network, or QoS
authorization, it means that the wrong thing can happen when this
field is not set properly. Consider a user in domain 1, calling a user
in domain 2. Domain 1 provides the user with a service they call
"voice chat", which utilizes voice and IM for real time conversation,
driven off of a buddy list application on a PC. Domain 2 provides
their users with a service they call, "text telephony", which is a
voice service on a wireless device that also allows the user to send
text messages. Consider the case where domain 1 and domain 2 both have
their user agents insert a service identifiers into the request, and
then use that to derive QoS authorization, accounting, and invocation
of applications in the network and in the device. The user in domain 1
calls the user in domain 2, and inserts the identifier "Voice Chat"
into the INVITE. When this arrives at the proxy in domain 2, the
service is unknown. Consequently, the request does not get the proper
QoS treatment. When it gets delivered to the User Agent of the user in
domain 2, the user agent does not see a service it understands, and so
consequently, does not know to dispatch the request to the right
application software. Thus, this call has completely failed, even when
it could have succeeded. This illustrates the following key point:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Explicit service identifiers, used between domains, cause
interoperability failures unless all interconnected domains agree on
exactly the same set of services and how to name them. 

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, lack of service identifiers does not guarantee service
interoperability. However, SIP was built with rich tools for
negotiation of capabilities at a finely granular level. One user agent
can make a call using audio and video, but if the receiving UA only
supports audio, SIP allows both sides to negotiate down to the lowest
common denominator. Thus, communications is still provided. As another
example, if one agent initiates a Push-To-Talk session (which is audio
with a companion floor control mechanism), and the other side only did
regular audio, SIP would be able to negotiate back down to a regular
voice call. As another example, if a calling user agent is running a
high-definition video conferencing endpoint, and the called user agent
supports just a regular video endpoint, the codecs themselves can
negotiate downward to a lower rate, picture size, and so on. Thus,
interoperability is achieved. Interestingly, the final "service" may
no longer be well characterized by the service identifier that would
have been placed in the original INVITE. For example, in this case, of
the original INVITE from the caller had contained the service
identifier, "hi-fi video", but the video gets negotiated down to a
lower rate and picture size, the service identifier is no longer
really appropriate.

</p>
<p>
This illustrates another key aspect of the interoperability problem:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Usage of explicit service identifiers in the request will result in
inconsistencies with results of any SIP negotiation that might
otherwise be applied in the session. 

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are cases where negotiating to a common baseline
is not what is desired. SIP provides tools (such as Require), to force
the call to fail unless the desired capabilities are
supported. However, this is not recommended as a general rule <a class='info' href='#RFC4485'>[RFC4485]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Guidelines for Authors of Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. 

</p>
<p>
When a service identifier becomes something that both proxies and the
user agent need to understand in order to properly treat a request, it
becomes equivalent to including a token in the Proxy-Require and
Require header fields of every single SIP request. The very reason
that RFC 4485 frowns upon usage of Require and certainly Proxy-Require
is the huge impact on interoperability it causes. It is for this same
reason that explicit service identifiers need to be avoided:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
The usage of explicit service identifiers is equivalent to the usage
of Require and Proxy-Require in the request, and has the same negative
impact on interoperability as those headers have.

Stifling of Service Innovation</h3>

<p>
The probability that any two pair of service providers end up with the
same set of services, and give them the same names, becomes
decreasingly small as the number of providers grow. Indeed, it would
almost certainly require a centralized authority to identify what the
services are, how they work, and what they are named. This, in turn,
leads to a requirement for complete homogeneity in order to facilitate
interconnection. Two providers cannot usefully interconnect unless
they agree on the set of services they are offering to their
customers, and each do the same thing. This is, in a very real sense,
anathema to the entire notion of SIP, which is built on the idea that
heterogeneous domains can interconnect and still get interoperability:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Explicit service identifiers lead to a requirement for homogeneity
in service definitions across providers that interconnect, ruining the
very service heterogeneity that SIP was meant to bring.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, Metcalfe's law says that the value of a network grows with the
square of the number of participants. As a consequence of this, once a
bunch of large domains did get together, agree on a set of services,
and then a set of well-known identifiers for those services, it would
force other providers to also deploy the same services, in order to
obtain the value that interconnection brings. This, in turn, will
stifle innovation, and quickly force the set of services in SIP to
become fixed and never expand beyond the ones initially agreed
upon. This, too, is anathema to the very framework on which SIP is
built, and defeats much of the purpose of why providers have chosen to
deploy SIP in their own networks:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Metcalfe's law, when combined with explicit service identifiers,
will stifle the ability of providers to develop new SIP services,
since they have no hope of interconnecting them with anyone else.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider the following example. Several providers get together, and
standardize on a bunch of service identifiers. One of these uses audio
and video (say, "multimedia conversation"). This service is
successful, and is widely utilized. Endpoints look for this identifier
to dispatch calls to the right software applications, and the network
looks for it to invoke features, perform accouting, and QoS. A new
provider gets the idea for a new service, say, avatar-enhanced
multimedia conversation. In this service, there is audio and video,
but there is a third stream, which renders an avatar. A caller can
press buttons on their phone, to cause the avatar on the other
person's device to show emotion, make noise, and so on. This is
similar to the way emoticons are used today in IM. This service is
enabled by adding a third media stream (and consequently, third
m-line) to the SDP. 

</p>
<p>
Normally, this service would be backwards compatible with a regular
audio-video endpoint, which would just reject the third media
stream. However, because a large network has been deployed that is
expecting to see the token, "multimedia conversation" and its
associated audio+video service, it is nearly impossible for the new
provider to roll out this new service. If they did, it would fail
completely, or partially fail, when their users call users in other
provider domains.

Recommendations</h3>

<p>
From these principles, several recommendations can be made:

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Systems needing to perform service identification must examine
existing signaling constructs to identify the service based on fields
that exist within the signaling message already.

</li>
<li>If it appears that the signaling currently defined in standards is
not sufficient to identify the service, it may be due to lack of
sufficient signaling to convey what is needed, and new standards work
should be undertaken to fill this gap.

</li>
<li>
The usage of an explicit service identifier does make sense as a way
to cache a decision made by a network element, for usage by another
network element within the same domain. However, service identifiers
are fundamentally useful within a particular domain, and any such
header must be stripped at a network boundary.

</li>
</ul>

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
Oftentimes, the service associated with a request is utilized for
purposes such as authorization, accounting, and billing. When service
identification is not done properly, the possibility of network fraud
is introduced. It is for this reason, discussed extensively in <a class='info' href='#sec-fraud'>Section&nbsp;6.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fraud</span><span>)</span></a>, that the usage of explicit service identifiers
inserted by a UA is NOT RECOMMENDED.
