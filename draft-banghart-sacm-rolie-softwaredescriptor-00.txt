         Definition of the ROLIE Software Descriptor Extension
            draft-banghart-sacm-rolie-softwaredescriptor-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core to add the information type category and
   related requirements needed to support Software Record and Software
   Inventory use cases.  The 'software-descriptor' information type is
   defined as a ROLIE extension.  Additional supporting requirements are
   also defined that describe the use of specific formats and link
   relations pertaining to the new information type.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) protocol to support the
   publication of software descriptor information.  Software descriptor
   information is information that characterizes:

      an installable software package, or

      information about static software components that may be installed
      by a software package or patch.

   Software descriptor information includes identifying, versioning,
   software creation and publication, and file artifact information.
   Software descriptor information provides data about what might be
   installed, but doesn't describe where or how a specific software
   installation is installed, configured, or executed.

   Software descriptor information can be used in the following ways:

Internet-Draft                    ROLIE                     October 2016


      Software providers can publish software descriptor information so
      that software researchers and users of software can understand the
      collection of software produced by a that software provider.

      Organizations can aggregate and syndicate collections of software
      descriptor information provided by multiple software providers to
      support software-related analysis processes (e.g., vulnerability
      analysis) and value added information (e.g., software
      configuration checklist repositories) using identification and
      characterization information derived from software descriptor
      information.

      End user organizations can consume sources of software descriptor
      information, and other related software vulnerability and
      configuration information to provide the data needed to automate
      software asset, patch, and configuration management practices.

   This document supports these use cases by describing the content
   requirements for Collections of software descriptor information that
   are to be published to or retrieved from a ROLIE repository.  This
   document also discusses requirements around the use of link
   relationships and describing the data model formats used in a ROLIE
   Entry describing a software descriptor information resource.

   TODO: describe how this approach differs from the SWIMA approach.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
   terminology used in this document can be found in Section 2 of
   [RFC5070].

3.  New information-types

   This document defines the following information type:

3.1.  The "software-descriptor" information type

   The "software-descriptor" information type represents any information
   that describes a piece of software.  This document uses the
   definition of software provided by [RFC4949].  Note that as per this
   definition, this information type pertains to static software, that
   is, code on the disc.  The software-descriptor information type is

Internet-Draft                    ROLIE                     October 2016


   intended to provide a category for information that does one or more
   of the following:

   identifies and characterizes software  This software identification
      and characterization information can be provided by a large
      variety of data, but always describes software in a pre-installed
      state.

   provides software installer metadata  This represents information
      about software used to install other software.  This metadata
      identifies, and characterizes a software installation package or
      media.

   describes stateless installation metadata  Information that describes
      the software post-deployment, such as files that may be deployed
      during an installation.  It is expected that this metadata is
      produced generally for a given installation, and may not exactly
      match the actual installed files on a given endpoint.

   Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of information that may be
   considered to be of a software-descriptor information type.

   o  Naming information: IDs and names that aid in the identification
      of a piece of software

   o  Version and patching information: Version numbers, patch
      identifiers, or other information that

   o  Vendor and source information: Includes where the software was
      developed or distributed from, as well as where the software
      installation media may be located.

   o  Payload and file information: information that describes or
      enumerates the files and folders that make up the piece of
      software, and information about those files.

   o  Descriptive information and data: Any information that otherwise
      characterizes a piece of software, such as libraries, runtime
      environments, target OSes, intended purpose or audience, etc.

   Note again that this list is not exhaustive, any information that in
   is the abstract realm of an incident should be classified under this
   information-type.

   This information type does not include descriptions of running
   software, or state and configuration information that is associated
   with a software installation.

   This document does not specify any additional requirements for use of
   the atom:feed element.

6.  Usage of the software-descriptor Information Type in an atom:entry

   This document specifies the following requirements for use of the
   software-descriptor information type with regards to Atom Entries.

6.1.  Use of the atom:link element

   This section defines the requirements around the use of atom:links in
   Entries.  Each relationship should be named,described, and given a

6.2.  Use of the rolie:format element

   New supported data formats would be described here alongside any
   other rolie:format requirements.

6.2.1.  The ISO SWID 2016 format

   The ISO SWID Tag 2016 format is a software descriptor and software
   record data format.  It provides several tags: primary, which
   provides descriptive and naming information about software, patch,
   which describes non-standalone software meant to patch existing
   software, and corpus, which describes the software installation media
   that installs a given piece of software.

   For a more complete overview as well as normative requirements, refer
   to TODO(ref?):ISO/IEC 19770-2

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  incident information-type

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE Security Resource Information
   Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type> .

   The entry is as follows:
