Abstract

   When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary
   to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers
   for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to
   support experimentation has been identified, and describes the
   numbers that have already been reserved by other documents.

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values              January 2006


   This is a strawman to see what the community thinks of allocating
   experimental numbers as [RFC3692] proposes to other IANA-maintained
   number spaces.


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3692] recommends assigning option numbers for experiments and
   testing.  This document requests [[anchor2: documents --(when
   assigned)]] such assignments for the number spaces whose IANA
   considerations are documented in [RFC2780].  This document generally
   follows the form of [RFC2780].

   When using these values, please carefully consider the advice in
   Sections 1 and 1.1 of [RFC3692].  It is not appropriate to simply
   select one of these values and hard code it into a system.


2.  Fields in the IPv4 header

   The IPv4 header [RFC0791] contains the following fields that carry
   values assigned by the IANA: Version, Type of Service, Protocol,
   Source Address, Destination Address, and Option Type.

2.1.  IPv4 IP Version field

   The IPv4 Version field is always 4.

2.2.  IPv4 Type of Service field

   [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 (all code points xxxx11, where 'x' refers to
   either '0' or '1') as Experimental / Local Use, so no additional code
   points should be needed.  The ECN field [RFC3168] has no free code
   points to assign.

2.3.  IPv4 Protocol field

   [RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for
   the IPv4 Protocol field.

2.4.  IPv4 Source and Destination addresses

2.4.1.  IPv4 Unicast

   No experimental IPv4 addresses are defined.  For certain experiments,
   the address ranges set aside for Private Internets in [RFC1918] may
   be useful.

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values              January 2006


2.4.2.  IPv4 Multicast

   The globally routable group 224.0.1.20 is set aside for
   experimentation.  For certain experiments, the administratively
   scoped multicast groups defined in [RFC2365] may be
   useful.[[anchor10: Should there be a 'link-local' 224.0.0.x
   experiment group? --wcf]]

2.5.  IPv4 Option Type field

   This document assigns a single option number, with all defined values
   of the "copy" and "class" fields, resulting in four distinct option
   type codes.


3.  Fields in the IPv6 header

   The IPv6 header [RFC2460] contains the following fields that carry
   values assigned from IANA-managed name spaces: Version, Traffic
   Class, Next Header, Source and Destination Address.  In addition, the
   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options and Destination Options extension headers
   include an Option Type field with values assigned from an IANA-
   managed name space.

3.1.  IPv6 Version field

   The IPv6 Version field is always 6.

3.2.  IPv6 Traffic Class field

   [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 (all code points xxxx11, where 'x' refers to
   either '0' or '1') as Experimental / Local Use, so no additional code
   points should be needed.  The ECN field [RFC3168] has no free code
   points to assign.

3.3.  IPv6 Next Header field

   [RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for
   the IPv6 Next Header field.

3.4.  IPv6 Source and Destination Addresses

3.4.1.  IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   No experimental IPv6 addresses are defined.  For certain experiments,
   Unique Local Addresses [I-D.ietf-ipv6-unique-local-addr] may be
   useful.

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values              January 2006


3.4.2.  IPv6 Multicast Addresses

   The group FF0X::114 is set aside for experimentation at all scope
   levels.  Smaller scopes may be particularly useful for
   experimentation, since they are defined not to leak out of a given
   defined boundary which can be set to be the boundary of the
   experiment.

3.5.  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destination Option Fields

   This document assigns a single option type, with all possible values
   of the "act" and "chg" fields, resulting in eight distinct option
   type codes.

3.6.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Fields

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery header [RFC2461] contains the following
   fields that carry values assigned from IANA-managed name spaces:
   Type, Code and Option Type.

3.6.1.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Type

   The Neighbor Discovery Type field is the same as the ICMPv6 Type
   field.  See Section 5 for those code points.

3.6.2.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Code

   The ICMPv6 Code field is not used in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, so no
   experimental code points are necessary.

3.6.3.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Type

   This document assigns two IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Types, TBD1
   and TBD2.


4.  Fields in the IPv4 ICMP header

   This document assigns two ICMPv4 type numbers, TBD1 and TBD2.  ICMPv4
   code values are allocated per-type, so it's not feasible to assign
   experimental values in this document.


5.  Fields in the IPv6 ICMP header

   [I-D.ietf-ipngwg-icmp-v3] includes experimental ICMPv6 type values
   for Informational (200, 201) and Error (100, 101) message types.
   ICMPv6 code values are allocated per-type, so it's not feasible to

Internet-Draft             Experimental Values              January 2006


   assign experimental values in this document.


6.  Fields in the UDP header

   Two system ports, TBD1 and TBD2, have been reserved for
   experimentation for UDP and TCP.


7.  Fields in the TCP header

7.1.  TCP Source and Destination Port fields

   Two system ports, TBD1 and TBD2, have been reserved for
   experimentation for UDP and TCP.

7.2.  Reserved Bits in TCP Header

   There are not enough reserved bits to allocate any for
   experimentation.

7.3.  TCP Option Kind field

   Two TCP options, TBD1 and TBD2, have been reserved for
   experimentation with TCP Options.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The new assignments are summarized below.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection
   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields
   described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,
   existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may
   fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity if the analyzer
   declines to forward the unrecognized traffic, or loss of security if
   it does forward the traffic and the new values are used as part of an
   attack.  Assigning known values for experiments can allow such
   analyzers to take a known action for explicitly experimental traffic.
