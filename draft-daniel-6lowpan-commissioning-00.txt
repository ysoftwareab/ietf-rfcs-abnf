Internet-Draft          Commissioning in 6LoWPAN               June 2007


1.  Introduction

   6LoWPAN is a low-power wireless personal area network(LoWPAN) which
   is comprised of the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard [ieee802.15.4]
   devices.  Every device needs specific procedure to start their
   functioning.  This procedure needs to be well defined for
   interoperability of devices from different vendors.  This document
   defines the procedure taken by 6LoWPAN constituent devices when they
   first start operation.  This procedure involves starting a new
   network, becoming part of existing network and obtaining IP settings.


2.  Terminology

      Active Scan
         An active scan is used by an FFD to locate all coordinators
         transmitting beacon frames within its personal operating space,
         which is provided by IEEE 802.15.4.  It request other devices
         to transmit the beacon frame.

      Association
         A IEEE 802.15.4 device can be assigned a dynamic 16 bit short
         address during an association operation with a neighbor device
         (or router) which is also called as the parent device.  After
         getting the short address, a device can communicate with its
         parent or child by using only the assigned short address.

      Coordinator
         A full-function device (FFD) which is the principal controller
         of a 6LoWPAN.  It is also called as PAN coordinator.  It MAY
         initiate the synchronization of the entire 6LoWPAN by
         transmitting beacons.

      ED Scan
         An ED scan allows a device to obtain a measure of the peak
         energy in each requested channel, which is provided by IEEE
         802.15.4.

      Full Function Device (FFD)
         A device implementing the complete protocol set of IEEE
         802.15.4.  It is capable of operating as a router (multi-hop
         packet forwarding) for its associated neighbors.

      Neighbor Table
         A table which has the information of neighbor devices in a
         personal operating space.

      PAN Id
         The 16 bit 6LoWPAN identifier which is administratively
         assigned to a 6LoWPAN.

      Passive Scan
         A passive scan, like an active scan, is used by an FFD to
         locate all coordinators transmitting beacon frames within its
         personal operating space, which is provided by IEEE 802.15.4.
         The difference is that the passive scan is a receive-only
         operation and does not request the beacon frame.

      Personal Operating Space (POS)
         The area within the reception range of the wireless
         transmission of a IEEE 802.15.4 packet.

      Reduced Function Device (RFD)
         A IEEE 802.15.4 device of 6LoWPAN which does not have the
         functionality of the router.  That is, it can not forward IPv6
         packets to the next hop device.  It can only be the end device
         of 6LoWPAN.

      Short Address
         A 16 bit address dynamically assigned to a device from its
         parent.


2.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Bootstrapping

   Bootstrapping is defined as associating with the network and
   obtaining IPv6 address.  Specifically, this includes the process of
   starting the network, associating with other nodes, obtaining the
   unique IPv6 address, and constructing security credentials for
   6LoWPAN.

3.1.  Scanning through channels

   For getting the information of other devices within POS, the device
   should perform a scan across a specified list of channels.  The
   device can use either an active scan or a passive scan.  During
   scanning procedure, the device receive beacon frames from other

   devices.  The beacon frame contains the information about the device
   sending it, which is used for determine whether a device is 6LoWPAN
   device or not.  If the device which send the beacon frame is
   distingushed as the 6LoWPAN device, its information should be stored
   in the neighbor table.

3.2.  Starting a new network

   A node which starts a new network may become the coordinator.  Which
   devices become the coordinator depends on the configuration of the
   device and the state of existing networks.

   Prior to starting a new network, the device first perform a scan for
   locating the PAN within its POS.  Detailed procedure of a scan is
   described in Section 4.  The device should select a channel with the
   least number of networks, preferrably selecting a channel with no
   network if possible.  On this step, The device may use an ED scan to
   select a channel which has less channel usage.

   After selecting a channel for a new network, the device shall select
   a PAN Id which is unique among PANs within its POS.  The algorithm
   for selecting a suitable PAN Id is TBD.

3.3.  Joining the network

3.3.1.  Joining the network with association

   To joining the network, the device first perform scanning for
   discoverying the PAN within its POS.  Detailed procedure of a scan is
   described in Section 4.  On completion of scan, the device selects
   the network it wishes to join from the scanning result.  It then
   finds the device which corresponds to that network in its neighbor
   table and it requests to associate using MAC primitive to that
   particular device.  The algorithm for selecting a device it wishes to
   associate among devices in the network is TBD.

3.3.2.  Joining the network without association

   The device doesn't need to associate with other devices to become
   part of the network.  The non-associated device, however, must use
   the 64-bit extended address to communicate.  In this case, the device
   should perform scanning periodically since devices aren't bound to
   each other strongly.  Detailed procedure of a scan is described in
   Section 4.

3.4.  Setting the beacon data structure

   After associating with the network, The device should set its beacon
   data structure, which is attached to the beacon frame.  The beacon
   data structure should contain the following information at least.

   o  Vendor ID
   o  Stack Version
   o  The Extended Address


4.  Assigning the short address

   During association procedure, every device except the coordinator is
   given its short address from the parent device which is being
   requested to associate.  The coordinator assigns its short address
   after selecting a PAN Id by itself.  The short address must be unique
   in a network and may be given by a distributed way.  The specific
   algorithm for assigning the short address is TBD.


5.  Obtaining IPv6 address

   An IPv6 interface identifier can be obtained as described in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-format].

   After having unique IPv6 interface identifier, the device begins to
   obtain IPv6 address prefix.  The IPv6 address prefix for a particular
   6LoWPAN are stored by the IPv6 router in that network.  ICMPv6 is
   used to share these parameters.  Routers in 6LoWPAN are supposed to
   send Router Advertisements(RA) message periodically.  RA must contain
   the prefix option which can be used in 6Lowpan.  Devices wish to
   obtain IPv6 address prefix may wait for an RA until RA_WAIT_TIME
   elapsed.  After that if there is still no RA received, they may send
   Router Solicitation(RS) message to request it.

   If there are multiple routers in a 6LoWPAN, the device should
   consider which one is chosen as a default router.  One possible way
   to do is to compare the hop count traveled of each RA message.  More
   detailed algorithm for selecting one from multiple router is TBD.


6.  IANA Consideration

   TBD.

7.  Security Considerations

   IEEE 802.15.4 devices is required to support AES link-layer security.
   MAC layer also provides all keying material necessary to provide the
   security services.

   It isn't defined, however, when security shall be used especially
   combining with bootstrapping.  After the device start and join the
   network, security services such as key management and device
   authentication should be done automatically.  Detailed algorithm for
   security on bootstrapping is TBD.
