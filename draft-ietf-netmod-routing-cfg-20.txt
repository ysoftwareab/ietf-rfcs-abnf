                A YANG Data Model for Routing Management
                    draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-20

Abstract

   This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
   Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
   framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is
   expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
   modules defining data models for routing protocols, route filters and
   other functions.  The core routing data model provides common
   building blocks for such extensions - routing instances, routes,
   routing information bases (RIB), and routing protocols.

1.  Introduction

   This document contains a specification of the following YANG modules:

   o  Module "ietf-routing" provides generic components of a routing
      data model.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv4 unicast.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv6 unicast.  It also
      augments the "ietf-interfaces" module [RFC7223] with IPv6 router
      configuration variables required by [RFC4861].

   These modules together define the so-called core routing data model,
   which is intended as a basis for future data model development
   covering more sophisticated routing systems.  While these three
   modules can be directly used for simple IP devices with static
   routing (see Appendix B), their main purpose is to provide essential
   building blocks for more complicated data models involving multiple
   routing protocols, multicast routing, additional address families,
   and advanced functions such as route filtering or policy routing.  To
   this end, it is expected that the core routing data model will be
   augmented by numerous modules developed by other IETF working groups.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Glossary of New Terms

   core routing data model:  YANG data model comprising "ietf-routing",
      "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing"
      modules.

   direct route:  a route to a directly connected network.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   routing information base (RIB):  An object containing a list of
      routes together with other information.  See Section 5.3 for
      details.

   system-controlled entry:  An entry of a list in state data ("config
      false") that is created by the system independently of what has
      been explicitly configured.  See Section 4.1 for details.

   user-controlled entry:  An entry of a list in state data ("config
      false") that is created and deleted as a direct consequence of
      certain configuration changes.  See Section 4.1 for details.

2.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the complete data tree is
   presented in Appendix A, and similar diagrams of its various subtrees
   appear in the main text.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only), "-x" RPC operations,
      and "-n" notifications.

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" a
      container with presence, and "*" denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, RPC operations and other data
   model objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear
   from the context in which YANG module each name is defined.
   Otherwise, names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated
   with the corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by the
   following objectives:

   o  The data model should be suitable for the common address families,
      in particular IPv4 and IPv6, and for unicast and multicast
      routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).

   o  A simple IP routing system, such as one that uses only static
      routing, should be configurable in a simple way, ideally without
      any need to develop additional YANG modules.

   o  On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow for
      complicated implementations involving multiple routing information
      bases (RIB) and multiple routing protocols, as well as controlled
      redistributions of routing information.

   o  Device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
      generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces.  Therefore, the framework should be
      flexible enough to facilitate such a mapping and accommodate data
      models with different logic.

4.  The Design of the Core Routing Data Model

   The core routing data model consists of three YANG modules.  The
   first module, "ietf-routing", defines the generic components of a
   routing system.  The other two modules, "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing"
   and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing", augment the "ietf-routing" module
   with additional data nodes that are needed for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast
   routing, respectively.  Figures 1 and 2 show abridged views of the
   configuration and state data hierarchies.  See Appendix A for the
   complete data trees.

   As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, the core routing data model
   introduces several generic components of a routing framework: routing
   instances, RIBs containing lists of routes, and routing protocols.
   Section 5 describes these components in more detail.

4.1.  System-Controlled and User-Controlled List Entries

   The core routing data model defines several lists in the schema tree,
   for example "routing-instance" or "rib", that have to be populated
   with at least one entry in any properly functioning device, and
   additional entries may be configured by a client.

   In such a list, the server creates the required item as a so-called
   system-controlled entry in state data, i.e., inside the "routing-
   state" container.

   Additional entries may be created in the configuration by a client,
   e.g., via the NETCONF protocol.  These are so-called user-controlled
   entries.  If the server accepts a configured user-controlled entry,
   then this entry also appears in the state data version of the list.

   Corresponding entries in both versions of the list (in state data and
   configuration) have the same value of the list key.

   A client may also provide supplemental configuration of system-
   controlled entries.  To do so, the client creates a new entry in the
   configuration with the desired contents.  In order to bind this entry
   to the corresponding entry in the state data list, the key of the
   configuration entry has to be set to the same value as the key of the
   state entry.

   An example can be seen in Appendix D: the "/routing-state/routing-
   instance" list has a single system-controlled entry whose "name" key
   has the value "rtr0".  This entry is configured by the "/routing/
   routing-instance" entry whose "name" key is also "rtr0".

   Deleting a user-controlled entry from the configuration list results
   in the removal of the corresponding entry in the state data list.  In
   contrast, if a system-controlled entry is deleted from the
   configuration list, only the extra configuration specified in that
   entry is removed but the corresponding state data entry remains in
   the list.

5.  Basic Building Blocks

   This section describes the essential components of the core routing
   data model.

5.1.  Routing Instance

   The core routing data model supports one or more routing instances
   appearing as entries of the "routing-instance" list.  Each routing
   instance has separate configuration and state data under



Lhotka & Lindem          Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   "/rt:routing/rt:routing-instance" and "/rt:routing-state/rt:routing-
   instance", respectively.

   No attempt has been made to define the semantics for every type of
   routing instance.  The core routing data model defines identities for
   two ubiquitous routing instance types:

   o  "default-routing-instance" - this routing instance type represents
      the default (or only) routing instance.  All implementations MUST
      provide one and only one system-controlled routing instance of
      this type.

   o  "vrf-routing-instance" - this routing instance type represents VRF
      (virtual routing and forwarding) routing instances that are used
      for virtual private networks (VPN) including BGP/MPLS
      VPN_[RFC4364].

   It is expected that future YANG modules will define other types of
   routing instances.  For every such type, an identity derived from
   "rt:routing-instance" SHALL be defined.  This identity is then
   referred to by the value of the "type" leaf (a child node of
   "routing-instance" list).

   By default, all network layer interfaces are assigned to the routing
   instance of the "default-routing-instance" type.  This can be changed
   by configuring the "rt:routing-instance" leaf in the interface
   configuration.

5.1.1.  Parameters of IPv6 Router Interfaces

   YANG module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" (Section 9) augments the
   configuration and state data of IPv6 interfaces with definitions of
   the following variables as required by [RFC4861], sec. 6.2.1:

   o  send-advertisements,

   o  max-rtr-adv-interval,

   o  min-rtr-adv-interval,

   o  managed-flag,

   o  other-config-flag,

   o  link-mtu,

   o  reachable-time,

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   o  retrans-timer,

   o  cur-hop-limit,

   o  default-lifetime,

   o  prefix-list: a list of prefixes to be advertised.

      The following parameters are associated with each prefix in the
      list:

      *  valid-lifetime,

      *  on-link-flag,

      *  preferred-lifetime,

      *  autonomous-flag.

   NOTES:

   1.  The "IsRouter" flag, which is also required by [RFC4861], is
       implemented in the "ietf-ip" module [RFC7277] (leaf
       "ip:forwarding").

   2.  The original specification [RFC4861] allows the implementations
       to decide whether the "valid-lifetime" and "preferred-lifetime"
       parameters remain the same in consecutive advertisements, or
       decrement in real time.  However, the latter behavior seems
       problematic because the values might be reset again to the
       (higher) configured values after a configuration is reloaded.
       Moreover, no implementation is known to use the decrementing
       behavior.  The "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module therefore
       assumes the former behavior with constant values.

5.2.  Route

   Routes are basic elements of information in a routing system.  The
   core routing data model defines only the following minimal set of
   route attributes:

   o  "destination-prefix": IP prefix specifying the set of destination
      addresses for which the route may be used.  This attribute is
      mandatory.

   o  "route-preference": an integer value (also known as administrative
      distance) that is used for selecting a preferred route among

      routes with the same destination prefix.  A lower value means a
      more preferred route.

   o  "next-hop": determines the action to be performed with a packet.

   Routes are primarily state data that appear as entries of RIBs
   (Section 5.3) but they may also be found in configuration data, for
   example as manually configured static routes.  In the latter case,
   configurable route attributes are generally a subset of route
   attributes described above.

5.3.  Routing Information Base (RIB)

   Every routing instance manages one or more routing information bases
   (RIB).  A RIB is a list of routes complemented with administrative
   data.  Each RIB contains only routes of one address family.  An
   address family is represented by an identity derived from the
   "rt:address-family" base identity.

   In the core routing data model, RIBs are state data represented as
   entries of the list "/routing-state/routing-instance/ribs/rib".  The
   contents of RIBs are controlled and manipulated by routing protocol
   operations which may result in route additions, removals and
   modifications.  This also includes manipulations via the "static"
   and/or "direct" pseudo-protocols, see Section 5.4.1.

   Each routing instance has, for every supported address family, one
   RIB marked as the so-called default RIB.  Its role is explained in
   Section 5.4.

   Simple router implementations that do not advertise the feature
   "multiple-ribs" will typically create one system-controlled RIB per
   routing instance and supported address family, and mark it as the
   default RIB.

   More complex router implementations advertising the "multiple-ribs"
   feature support multiple RIBs per address family that can be used for
   policy routing and other purposes.

5.4.  Routing Protocol

   The core routing data model provides an open-ended framework for
   defining multiple routing protocol instances within a routing
   instance.  Each routing protocol instance MUST be assigned a type,
   which is an identity derived from the "rt:routing-protocol" base
   identity.  The core routing data model defines two identities for the
   direct and static pseudo-protocols (Section 5.4.1).

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   Multiple routing protocol instances of the same type MAY be
   configured within the same routing instance.

5.4.1.  Routing Pseudo-Protocols

   The core routing data model defines two special routing protocol
   types - "direct" and "static".  Both are in fact pseudo-protocols,
   which means they are confined to the local device and do not exchange
   any routing information with adjacent routers.

   Every routing instance MUST implement exactly one instance of the
   "direct" pseudo-protocol type.  It is the source of direct routes for
   all configured address families.  Direct routes are normally supplied
   by the operating system kernel, based on the configuration of network
   interface addresses, see Section 6.2.  Direct routes MUST be
   installed in default RIBs of all supported address families.

   A pseudo-protocol of the type "static" allows for specifying routes
   manually.  It MAY be configured in zero or multiple instances,
   although a typical configuration will have exactly one instance per
   routing instance.

5.4.2.  Defining New Routing Protocols

   It is expected that future YANG modules will create data models for
   additional routing protocol types.  Such a new module has to define
   the protocol-specific configuration and state data, and it has to fit
   it into the core routing framework in the following way:

   o  A new identity MUST be defined for the routing protocol and its
      base identity MUST be set to "rt:routing-protocol", or to an
      identity derived from "rt:routing-protocol".

   o  Additional route attributes MAY be defined, preferably in one
      place by means of defining a YANG grouping.  The new attributes
      have to be inserted by augmenting the definitions of the nodes

       /rt:routing-state/rt:ribs/rt:rib/rt:routes/rt:route

      and

       /rt:fib-route/rt:output/rt:route,

      and possibly other places in the configuration, state data,
      notifications, and RPC input or output.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   o  Configuration parameters and/or state data for the new protocol
      can be defined by augmenting the "routing-protocol" data node
      under both "/routing" and "/routing-state".

   By using a "when" statement, the augmented configuration parameters
   and state data specific to the new protocol SHOULD be made
   conditional and valid only if the value of "rt:type" or "rt:source-
   protocol" is equal to the new protocol's identity.

   It is also RECOMMENDED that protocol-specific data nodes be
   encapsulated in an appropriately named container with presence.  Such
   a container may contain mandatory data nodes that are otherwise
   forbidden at the top level of an augment.

   The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module for the
   RIP routing protocol in Appendix C.

5.5.  RPC Operations

   The "ietf-routing" module defines one RPC operation:

   o  fib-route: query a routing instance for the active route in the
      Forwarding Information Base (FIB).  It is the route that is
      currently used for sending datagrams to a destination host whose
      address is passed as an input parameter.

6.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules

   The semantics of the core routing data model also depends on several
   configuration parameters that are defined in other YANG modules.

6.1.  Module "ietf-interfaces"

   The following boolean switch is defined in the "ietf-interfaces" YANG
   module [RFC7223]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then all routing and forwarding functions MUST be disabled on that
      interface.

6.2.  Module "ietf-ip"

   The following boolean switches are defined in the "ietf-ip" YANG
   module [RFC7277]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:enabled



Lhotka & Lindem          Expires April 18, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then all IPv4 routing and forwarding functions MUST be disabled on
      that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then the forwarding of IPv4 datagrams through this interface MUST
      be disabled.  However, the interface MAY participate in other IPv4
      routing functions, such as routing protocols.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then all IPv6 routing and forwarding functions MUST be disabled on
      that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then the forwarding of IPv6 datagrams through this interface MUST
      be disabled.  However, the interface MAY participate in other IPv6
      routing functions, such as routing protocols.

   In addition, the "ietf-ip" module allows for configuring IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses and network prefixes or masks on network layer
   interfaces.  Configuration of these parameters on an enabled
   interface MUST result in an immediate creation of the corresponding
   direct route.  The destination prefix of this route is set according
   to the configured IP address and network prefix/mask, and the
   interface is set as the outgoing interface for that route.

11.  Security Considerations

   Configuration and state data conforming to the core routing data
   model (defined in this document) are designed to be accessed via the
   NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides
   the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and
   content.

   A number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules belonging to the
   configuration part of the core routing data model are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true" in YANG terms,
   which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations to
   these data nodes, such as "edit-config", can have negative effects on
   the network if the protocol operations are not properly protected.

   The vulnerable "config true" parameters and subtrees are the
   following:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/rt:routing-instance:  This leaf assigns a
      network layer interface to a routing instance.

   /routing/routing-instance/routing-protocols/routing-protocol:  This
      list specifies the routing protocols configured on a device.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   /routing/routing-instance/ribs/rib:  This list specifies the RIBs
      configured for the device.

   Unauthorised access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
   routing subsystem of both the local device and the network.  This may
   lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations and other problems.

Appendix B.  Minimum Implementation

   Some parts and options of the core routing model, such as user-
   defined RIBs, are intended only for advanced routers.  This appendix
   gives basic non-normative guidelines for implementing a bare minimum
   of available functions.  Such an implementation may be used for hosts
   or very simple routers.

   A minimum implementation provides a single system-controlled routing
   instance of the type "default-routing-instance", and will not allow
   clients to create any user-controlled instances.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   Typically, the feature "multiple-ribs" will not be supported.  This
   means that a single system-controlled RIB is available for each
   supported address family - IPv4, IPv6 or both.  These RIBs must be
   the default RIBs.  No user-controlled RIBs are allowed.

   In addition to the mandatory instance of the "direct" pseudo-
   protocol, a minimum implementation should support configuring
   instance(s) of the "static" pseudo-protocol.

   Platforms with severely constrained resources may use deviations for
   restricting the data model, e.g., limiting the number of "static"
   routing protocol instances.

Appendix C.  Example: Adding a New Routing Protocol

   This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can be
   extended to support a new routing protocol.  The YANG module
   "example-rip" shown below is intended as an illustration rather than
   a real definition of a data model for the RIP routing protocol.  For
   the sake of brevity, this module does not obey all the guidelines
   specified in [RFC6087].  See also Section 5.4.2.

   module example-rip {

     namespace "http://example.com/rip";

     prefix "rip";

     import ietf-interfaces {
       prefix "if";
     }

     import ietf-routing {
       prefix "rt";
     }

     identity rip {
       base rt:routing-protocol;
       description
         "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
     }

     typedef rip-metric {
       type uint8 {
         range "0..16";
       }
     }

   We assume a simple network set-up as shown in Figure 3: router "A"
   uses static default routes with the "ISP" router as the next-hop.
   IPv6 router advertisements are configured only on the "eth1"
   interface and disabled on the upstream "eth0" interface.

Appendix E.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: Remove this section upon publication as an RFC.

E.1.  Changes Between Versions -19 and -20

   o  Assignment of L3 interfaces to routing instances is now part of
      interface configuration.

   o  Next-hop options in configuration were aligned with state data.

   o  It is recommended to enclose protocol-specific configuration in a
      presence container.

E.2.  Changes Between Versions -18 and -19

   o  The leaf "route-preference" was removed from the "routing-
      protocol" container in both "routing" and "routing-state".

   o  The "vrf-routing-instance" identity was added in support of a
      common routing-instance type in addition to the "default-routing-
      instance".

   o  Removed "enabled" switch from "routing-protocol".

E.3.  Changes Between Versions -17 and -18

   o  The container "ribs" was moved under "routing-instance" (in both
      "routing" and "routing-state").

   o  Typedefs "rib-ref" and "rib-state-ref" were removed.

   o  Removed "recipient-ribs" (both state and configuration).

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   o  Removed "connected-ribs" from "routing-protocol" (both state and
      configuration).

   o  Configuration and state data for IPv6 RA were moved under
      "if:interface" and "if:interface-state".

   o  Assignment of interfaces to routing instances now use leaf-list
      rather than list (both config and state).  The opposite reference
      from "if:interface" to "rt:routing-instance" was changed to a
      single leaf (an interface cannot belong to multiple routing
      instances).

   o  Specification of a default RIB is now a simple flag under "rib"
      (both config and state).

   o  Default RIBs are marked by a flag in state data.

E.4.  Changes Between Versions -16 and -17

   o  Added Acee as a co-author.

   o  Removed all traces of route filters.

   o  Removed numeric IDs of list entries in state data.

   o  Removed all next-hop cases except "simple-next-hop" and "special-
      next-hop".

   o  Removed feature "multipath-routes".

   o  Augmented "ietf-interfaces" module with a leaf-list of leafrefs
      pointing form state data of an interface entry to the routing
      instance(s) to which the interface is assigned.

E.5.  Changes Between Versions -15 and -16

   o  Added 'type' as the second key component of 'routing-protocol',
      both in configuration and state data.

   o  The restriction of no more than one connected RIB per address
      family was removed.

   o  Removed the 'id' key of routes in RIBs.  This list has no keys
      anymore.

   o  Remove the 'id' key from static routes and make 'destination-
      prefix' the only key.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   o  Added 'route-preference' as a new attribute of routes in RIB.

   o  Added 'active' as a new attribute of routes in RIBs.

   o  Renamed RPC operation 'active-route' to 'fib-route'.

   o  Added 'route-preference' as a new parameter of routing protocol
      instances, both in configuration and state data.

   o  Renamed identity 'rt:standard-routing-instance' to 'rt:default-
      routing-instance'.

   o  Added next-hop lists to state data.

   o  Added two cases for specifying next-hops indirectly - via a new
      RIB or a recursive list of next-hops.

   o  Reorganized next-hop in static routes.

   o  Removed all 'if-feature' statements from state data.

E.6.  Changes Between Versions -14 and -15

   o  Removed all defaults from state data.

   o  Removed default from 'cur-hop-limit' in config.

E.7.  Changes Between Versions -13 and -14

   o  Removed dependency of 'connected-ribs' on the 'multiple-ribs'
      feature.

   o  Removed default value of 'cur-hop-limit' in state data.

   o  Moved parts of descriptions and all references on IPv6 RA
      parameters from state data to configuration.

   o  Added reference to RFC 6536 in the Security section.

E.8.  Changes Between Versions -12 and -13

   o  Wrote appendix about minimum implementation.

   o  Remove "when" statement for IPv6 router interface state data - it
      was dependent on a config value that may not be present.

   o  Extra container for the next-hop list.

   o  Names rather than numeric ids are used for referring to list
      entries in state data.

   o  Numeric ids are always declared as mandatory and unique.  Their
      description states that they are ephemeral.

   o  Descriptions of "name" keys in state data lists are required to be
      persistent.

   o

   o  Removed "if-feature multiple-ribs;" from connected-ribs.

   o  "rib-name" instead of "name" is used as the name of leafref nodes.

   o  "next-hop" instead of "nexthop" or "gateway" used throughout, both
      in node names and text.

E.9.  Changes Between Versions -11 and -12

   o  Removed feature "advanced-router" and introduced two features
      instead: "multiple-ribs" and "multipath-routes".

   o  Unified the keys of config and state versions of "routing-
      instance" and "rib" lists.

   o  Numerical identifiers of state list entries are not keys anymore,
      but they are constrained using the "unique" statement.

   o  Updated acknowledgements.

E.10.  Changes Between Versions -10 and -11

   o  Migrated address families from IANA enumerations to identities.

   o  Terminology and node names aligned with the I2RS RIB model: router
      -> routing instance, routing table -> RIB.

   o  Introduced uint64 keys for state lists: routing-instance, rib,
      route, nexthop.

   o  Described the relationship between system-controlled and user-
      controlled list entries.

   o  Feature "user-defined-routing-tables" changed into "advanced-
      router".

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   o  Made nexthop into a choice in order to allow for nexthop-list
      (I2RS requirement).

   o  Added nexthop-list with entries having priorities (backup) and
      weights (load balancing).

   o  Updated bibliography references.

E.11.  Changes Between Versions -09 and -10

   o  Added subtree for state data ("/routing-state").

   o  Terms "system-controlled entry" and "user-controlled entry"
      defined and used.

   o  New feature "user-defined-routing-tables".  Nodes that are useful
      only with user-defined routing tables are now conditional.

   o  Added grouping "router-id".

   o  In routing tables, "source-protocol" attribute of routes now
      reports only protocol type, and its datatype is "identityref".

   o  Renamed "main-routing-table" to "default-routing-table".

E.12.  Changes Between Versions -08 and -09

   o  Fixed "must" expression for "connected-routing-table".

   o  Simplified "must" expression for "main-routing-table".

   o  Moved per-interface configuration of a new routing protocol under
      'routing-protocol'.  This also affects the 'example-rip' module.

E.13.  Changes Between Versions -07 and -08

   o  Changed reference from RFC6021 to RFC6021bis.

E.14.  Changes Between Versions -06 and -07

   o  The contents of <get-reply> in Appendix D was updated: "eth[01]"
      is used as the value of "location", and "forwarding" is on for
      both interfaces and both IPv4 and IPv6.

   o  The "must" expression for "main-routing-table" was modified to
      avoid redundant error messages reporting address family mismatch
      when "name" points to a non-existent routing table.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            October 2015


   o  The default behavior for IPv6 RA prefix advertisements was
      clarified.

   o  Changed type of "rt:router-id" to "ip:dotted-quad".

   o  Type of "rt:router-id" changed to "yang:dotted-quad".

   o  Fixed missing prefixes in XPath expressions.

E.15.  Changes Between Versions -05 and -06

   o  Document title changed: "Configuration" was replaced by
      "Management".

   o  New typedefs "routing-table-ref" and "route-filter-ref".

   o  Double slashes "//" were removed from XPath expressions and
      replaced with the single "/".

   o  Removed uniqueness requirement for "router-id".

   o  Complete data tree is now in Appendix A.

   o  Changed type of "source-protocol" from "leafref" to "string".

   o  Clarified the relationship between routing protocol instances and
      connected routing tables.

   o  Added a must constraint saying that a routing table connected to
      the direct pseudo-protocol must not be a main routing table.

E.16.  Changes Between Versions -04 and -05

   o  Routing tables are now global, i.e., "routing-tables" is a child
      of "routing" rather than "router".

   o  "must" statement for "static-routes" changed to "when".

   o  Added "main-routing-tables" containing references to main routing
      tables for each address family.

   o  Removed the defaults for "address-family" and "safi" and made them
      mandatory.

   o  Removed the default for route-filter/type and made this leaf
      mandatory.

   o  If there is no active route for a given destination, the "active-
      route" RPC returns no output.

   o  Added "enabled" switch under "routing-protocol".

   o  Added "router-type" identity and "type" leaf under "router".

   o  Route attribute "age" changed to "last-updated", its type is
      "yang:date-and-time".

   o  The "direct" pseudo-protocol is always connected to main routing
      tables.

   o  Entries in the list of connected routing tables renamed from
      "routing-table" to "connected-routing-table".

   o  Added "must" constraint saying that a routing table must not be
      its own recipient.

E.17.  Changes Between Versions -03 and -04

   o  Changed "error-tag" for both RPC operations from "missing element"
      to "data-missing".

   o  Removed the decrementing behavior for advertised IPv6 prefix
      parameters "valid-lifetime" and "preferred-lifetime".

   o  Changed the key of the static route lists from "seqno" to "id"
      because the routes needn't be sorted.

   o  Added 'must' constraint saying that "preferred-lifetime" must not
      be greater than "valid-lifetime".

E.18.  Changes Between Versions -02 and -03

   o  Module "iana-afn-safi" moved to I-D "iana-if-type".

   o  Removed forwarding table.

   o  RPC "get-route" changed to "active-route".  Its output is a list
      of routes (for multi-path routing).

   o  Assignment of interfaces to router instances needn't be disjoint.

   o  Route filters are now global.

   o  Added "allow-all-route-filter" for symmetry.

   o  Added Section 6 about interactions with "ietf-interfaces" and
      "ietf-ip".

   o  Added "router-id" leaf.

   o  Specified the names for IPv4/IPv6 unicast main routing tables.

   o  Route parameter "last-modified" changed to "age".

   o  Added container "recipient-routing-tables".

E.19.  Changes Between Versions -01 and -02

   o  Added module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing".

   o  The example in Appendix D now uses IP addresses from blocks
      reserved for documentation.

   o  Direct routes appear by default in the forwarding table.

   o  Network layer interfaces must be assigned to a router instance.
      Additional interface configuration may be present.

   o  The "when" statement is only used with "augment", "must" is used
      elsewhere.

   o  Additional "must" statements were added.

   o  The "route-content" grouping for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast now
      includes the material from the "ietf-routing" version via "uses
      rt:route-content".

   o  Explanation of symbols in the tree representation of data model
      hierarchy.

E.20.  Changes Between Versions -00 and -01

   o  AFN/SAFI-independent stuff was moved to the "ietf-routing" module.
