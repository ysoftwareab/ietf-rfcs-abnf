Abstract 
    
   This document defines data for privacy and security policy assurance 
   applications to be output from healthcare application systems.  It 
   supplements existing system-specific security audits with healthcare 
   application-specific requirements.  It also anticipates the existence 
   of common repository systems that receive audit data from multiple 
   application systems and the associated operating infrastructure 
   components.

1. Purpose 
    
   The purposes the document fulfills are to: 
    
   1) Define data to be communicated for evidence of compliance with, 
      and violations of, a healthcare enterpriseÆs security and privacy 
      policies. 
       
      The focus of auditing in this document is to retrospectively 
      detect and report security/privacy breaches, versus directly 
      inhibiting access   This includes capturing data that supports 
      individual accountability for patient record creation, access, 
      updates, and deletions.  It does not include real-time access 
      alarm actions since there is a perception in the healthcare 
      community that security measures that inhibit access may also 
      inhibit effective patient care, under some circumstances.

   2) Depict the data that would reside in a common audit engine or 
      database. 
       
      Privacy and security audit data is to be collected on each 
      hardware system, and there are likely to be separate local data 
      stores for system-level and application-level audits.  Collating 
      these records and providing a common view û transcending hardware 
      system boundaries û is seen as necessary for cost-effective 
      security and privacy policy administration.  The data definitions 
      support such a collation, but the technical implementation 
      alternatives are not covered in this document. 
    
   3) Allow useful queries against audited events. 
       
      Audit data, in its raw form, reflects a sequential view of system 
      activity.  Useful inquiries for security and privacy 
      administration need workflow, business process, organizational, 
      role, and person-oriented views.  The data definitions support 
      creating those views. 
       
   4) Provide a common reference standard for healthcare IT standards 
      development organizations. 
       
      This document consolidates previously disjoint viewpoints from 
      Health Level 7 (HL7)[3], Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise 
      (IHE)[4], and the ASTM International Healthcare Informatics 
      Technical Committee (ASTM E31)[5].  It is intended as a reference 
      for these three groups and other healthcare standards developers.     
    
    
2. Scope 
    
2.1  Data Collection  
    
   This document covers audit data to be collected and communicated from 
   automated systems.  It does not include non-automated processes.  
    
   For each audited event, this document specifies the minimal data 
   requirements plus optional data for the following event categories: 
    
   1) Patient care data events û documenting what was done, by whom, 
      using which resources, from what access points, and to whose 
      medical data.  In general, these audits are application-specific 
      since they require knowledge of the application data content. 
    
   2) Security-mediated events û recording entity identification and 
      authentication, data access, function access, nonrepudiation, 
      cryptographic operations, and data import/export for messages and 
      reports.  In general, these events are generic to all protected 
      resources, without regard to the application data content.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

    
   3) Security administrative events û establishing and maintaining 
      security policy definitions, secured object definitions, role 
      definitions, user definitions, and the relationships among them.  
      In general, these events are specific to the administrative 
      applications. 
    
   4) Audit access events û reflecting special protections implemented 
      for the audit trail itself. 
    
   Data for events in the above categories may be selectively collected, 
   based on healthcare organization policy.  This document does not 
   specify any baseline or minimal policies.     
    
2.2  System Infrastructure 
    
   Security subsystems found in most system infrastructures include a 
   capability to capture system-level security relevant events like 
   logon and security object accesses.  We assume such functions are 
   enabled and capable of recording and supplying the data defined in 
   this document, although transformation to conform to the common XML 
   schema definition will be required.   
    
2.3  Included Data End-uses  
    
   This document assumes that there is a requirement to transmit data 
   from multiple systems to a common repository.  This arises from the 
   typical healthcare IT environment, containing many systems from 
   various vendors and developers who have not implemented common or 
   interoperable security administrative functions. 
    
   Application-level events, like patient record access, are not 
   captured by system-level security audits.  The defined data support 
   applicationsÆ record access auditing for healthcare institutional 
   security and privacy assurance plus related policy administration 
   functions. 
    
2.4  Excluded Data End Uses 
 
   There are distinctions between audit data required for surveillance 
   versus forensic purposes.  While some surveillance data may useful 
   for forensics, the scope of this document is limited to surveillance. 
    
   This document does not address access real-time policy violation 
   alarm actions.  There is a perception in the healthcare community 
   that security measures that inhibit access may also inhibit effective 
   patient care, under some circumstances.   
    
   This document does not define any data for patient care consents or 
   patients' permissions for data disclosure.  It is conceivable that

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

   the proposed audit data could be input to such applications, however, 
   assuming strict access controls for audit data have been established. 
    
   System-local data definitions for collection and storage of audit 
   data, prior to transformation to a common schema and transmission to 
   a common repository, are not included in this document. 
    
   This document does not define system-specific or application-specific 
   data that may be collected and reported in addition to the defined 
   elements.  At the same time it does not preclude such data. 
    
   There is a potential requirement for a set of administrative messages 
   to be sent from a central source to each participating system to 
   uniformly specify, control, enable, or disable audit data collection.  
   Such messages are not included in this document. 
    
2.5  Conformance 
    
   This document does not include any definitions of conformance 
   practices. 
    
3. Goals 
       
3.1  Effective Data Gathering 
    
   The process of assuring that security policies are implemented 
   correctly is essential to information security administration.  It is 
   a set of interrelated tasks all aimed at maintaining an acceptable 
   level of confidence that security protections are, in fact, working 
   as intended.  These tasks are assisted by data from automated 
   instrumentation of system and application functions. 
    
   Data gathered from a secured environment is used to accumulate 
   evidence that security systems are working as intended and to detect 
   incidents and patterns of misuse for further actions.  Once messages 
   have been collected, various reports may be created in support of 
   security assurance and administration information requirements. 
    
   When a site runs multiple heterogeneous applications, each 
   application system may have its own security mechanisms - user logon, 
   roles, access right permissions and restrictions, etc.  Each 
   application system also has its own security log file that records 
   security relevant events, e.g., login, data access, and updates to 
   the security policy databases.  A system administrator or security 
   auditor must examine each of these log files to find security 
   relevant incidents.  Not only is it difficult to examine each of 
   these files separately, the format and contents of each file may be 
   confusingly different.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

   Resolving these issues requires a framework to: 
    
   -  Maximize interoperability and the meaningfulness of data across 
      applications and sites 
   -  Minimize ambiguity among heterogeneous systems 
   -  Simplify and limits costs for administrative audit tasks. 
    
3.2  Efficiency 
    
   One of the leading concerns about auditing is the potential volume of 
   data gathering and its impact on application system performance.  
   Although this document does not prescribe specific implementations or 
   strategies, the following are meant as informative guidance for 
   development. 
    
   1) Audits should be created for transactions or record-access, not 
      for individual attribute-level changes to data. 
    
   2) This document does not discourage locally optimized gathering of 
      audit data on each application system.  Instead, it anticipates 
      periodic gathering and transmission of data to a common 
      repository.  This common repository would be optimized for after-
      the-fact audit queries and reporting, thus unburdening each 
      application system of those responsibilities.  It is also 
      important to keep the message size compact so that audit data will 
      not penalize normal network operation. 
    
   3) On each application system, a variety of policy-based methods 
      could be employed to optimize data gathering and storage, e.g., 
      selective auditing of only events defined as important plus 
      workload buffering and balancing.  Data gathering itself should be 
      stateless to avoid the overhead of transactional semantics.  In 
      addition, prior to transmission, some summarization of repeated 
      events would reduce the number of messages.  Audit data storage 
      and integrity on each application system need only be scaled for 
      relatively low-volume and short-duration requirements. 
    
   4) Leveraging existing data collection should be considered.  For 
      example, it is common is some systemsÆ designs to provide a 
      transaction log for data reconstruction in event of database loss.  
      Collecting audit data within this subsystem could reduce impact on 
      system performance. 
    
   5) A security audit repository would gather all audit message data 
      from the different applications in one database with one standard 
      structure.  This would allow easier evaluation and querying.  Once 
      a suspicious pattern has been found in the audit log repository, 
      investigation might proceed with more detail in the application 
      specific audit log.  The presence of a common repository also

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

      simplifies and streamlines the implementation of policies for 
      audit data storage, integrity, retention, and destruction. 
    
    
4. Trigger Events 
    
   The following identifies trigger events for generating audit 
   messages.  These should be viewed as application-level events.  For 
   those events arising in the security infrastructure the "minimal" and 
   "basic" level of auditing as outlined in the Common Criteria[6] 
   should be used as a reference standard.   
    
4.1  Security Administration 
    
   This group includes all actions that create and maintain definitions 
   for securing data, functions, and the associated access policies.  
   For each trigger type, the creation, update or amendment, and 
   activation or deactivation are auditable. 
 
4.1.1 Data Definition 
    
   This includes data definitions for data sets, data groups, or classes 
   plus the atomic data elements or attributes. 
 
4.1.2 Function Definition 
    
   This includes, for example, application function definitions for 
   patient management and clinical processes, registry of business 
   objects and methods, program creation and maintenance, etc. 
 
4.1.3 Domain Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create or modify security domains 
   according to various organizational categories such as entity-wide, 
   institutional, departmental, etc.: 
 
4.1.4 Classification Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create or modify security 
   categories or groupings for functions and data such as patient 
   management, nursing, clinical, etc. 
 
4.1.5 Permission Definition 
 
   This includes all activities that create or modify the allowable 
   access permissions associated with functions and data, such as 
   create, read, update, delete, and execution of specific functional 
   units or object access or manipulation methods.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

4.1.6 Role Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create or modify security roles 
   according to various task-grouping categories such as security 
   administration, admissions desk, nurses, physicians, clinical 
   specialists, etc.  It also includes the association of permissions 
   with roles for role-based access control. 
 
4.1.7 User Definition 
    
   This includes all activities that create or modify user accounts.  It 
   also includes the association of roles with users for role-based 
   access control, or permissions with users for user-based access 
   control. 
    
4.2  Audit Administration and Data Access 
    
   This category includes all actions that determine the collection and 
   availability of audit data.   
    
4.2.1 Audit Enable or Disable 
    
   This reflects a basic policy decision that an event should or should 
   not be audited.  Some, but not necessarily all, triggers or use cases 
   must create an audit record.  The selection of what to audit depends 
   on administrative policy decisions.  Note that, for integrity, this 
   event should always be audited. 
 
4.2.2 Audit Data Access 
    
   This includes instances where audit data is viewed or reported for 
   any purpose.  Since the audit data itself may include data protected 
   by institutional privacy policies and expose the implementation of 
   those policies, access to the data is highly sensitive.  This event 
   should therefore always be audited. 
 
4.2.3 Audit Data Modify or Delete 
    
   This includes instance where audit data is modified or deleted.  This 
   is a signature event for unauthorized hostile systems access.  This 
   event should therefore always be audited. 
    
4.3  User Access 
    
   This category includes events of access to secured data and functions 
   for which audit data might be collected.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

4.3.1 Sign-On 
    
   This includes successful and unsuccessful attempts from human users 
   and automated systems. 
 
4.3.2 Sign-Off 
    
   This includes explicit sign-off events and session abandonment 
   timeouts from human users and automated systems. 
 
4.3.3 Function Access 
    
   This includes user invocation of application or system functions that 
   have permission definitions associated with them.  Note that in a 
   Discretionary Access Control environment not all functions require 
   permissions, especially if their impact is benign in relation to 
   policies. 
     
   The following items enumerate audit triggers that are relevant to 
   patient privacy.  Additional triggers for   institutional data 
   access, policies for non-care functions, and support regulatory 
   requirements will need to be identified by system implementers. 
 
4.3.3.1 Subject of Care Record Access 
    
   This includes all functions which manipulate basic patient data: 
    
   -  Create, e.g., demographics or patient profile 
   -  Assign identifier, e.g., medical record number 
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Merge/unmerge, e.g., combine multiple medical records for one 
      patient 
   -  Import/export of data  from/to an external source, including 
      printing and creation of portable media copies. 
    
4.3.3.2 Encounter or Visit  
    
   This includes all functions which associate a subject of care with an 
   instance of care: 
    
   -  Create, e.g., demographics or patient profile 
   -  Assign encounter identifier 
   -  Per-admit 
   -  Admit 
   -  Update, amend

4.3.3.3 Care Protocols 
    
   This includes all functions which associate care plans or similar 
   protocols with an instance or subject of care: 
    
   -  Schedule, initiate 
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Complete 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.4 Episodes or Problems 
 
   This includes specific clinical episodes within an instance of care. 
   Initiate 
    
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Resolve, complete 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.5 Orders and Order Sets 
    
   This includes clinical or supplies orders within an instance or 
   episode of care. 
    
   -  Initiate 
   -  Update, amend 
   -  Complete 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.6 Health Service Event or Act 
    
   This includes various health services scheduled and performed within 
   an instance or episode of care 
    
   -  Schedule, initiate 
   -  Perform, complete 
   -  Cancel 
    
4.3.3.7 Medications 
 
   This includes all medication orders and administration within an 
   instance or episode of care.  These are distinct from orders and 
   events in the need to check for adverse interactions and to verify 
   the medications prior to delivery. 
    
   -  Order 
   -  Check  
   -  Cancel interactions 
   -  Verify 
   -  Dispense/deliver û including administration instructions

   -  Administer 
    
4.3.3.8 Staff Assignment 
    
   This includes staffing actions relevant to an instance or episode of 
   care. 
    
   -  Assignment of healthcare professionals, caregivers attending 
      physician, residents, medical students, consultants, etc. 
   -  Change in assigned role or authorization, e.g., relative to 
      healthcare status change. 
   -  De-assignment 
    
      
5. Data Definitions 
    
   The proposed data elements are grouped into these categories: 
   1) Event Identification û what was done 
   2) User Identification û by whom 
   3) Audit Source Identification û using which server 
   4) Network Access Point Identification û initiated from where 
   5) Participant Object Identification û to what record 
    
5.1  Event Identification 
    
   The following data identify the name, action type, time, and 
   disposition of the audited event.  There is only one set of event 
   identification data per audited event. 
    
5.1.1 Event ID  

   Description 
       
      Required 
       
      Identifier for a specific audited event, e.g., a menu item, 
      program, rule, policy, function code, or application name, or URL.  
      It identifies the performed function.  
       
   Format / Values 
       
      Identifier string for the function.  This should be an unambiguous 
      code, unique, at least within Audit Source ID.  Examples of Event 
      IDs are program name, method name, or function name. 
       
   Rationale 
    
      This field identifies the audited function.  For analyzing 
      ôExecuteö Event Action Code audit records, this identifies the 
      application function performed.

   Rationale 
    
      This broadly indicates what kind of action was done on the

   Notes 
       
      Actions that are not enumerated above are considered an Execute of 
      a specific function or object interface method or treated two or 
      more distinct events.  An application action, such as an 
      authorization, is a function Execute, and the Event ID should 
      identify the function.  For compound actions, such as ôMove,ö 
      should be audited by creating audit data for each operation û 
      read, create, delete û or as an Execute of a function or method.

      Universal coordinated time (UTC), i.e. a date/time specification 
      that is unambiguous as to local time zones.   
    
   Format / Values 
       
      A date/time representation that is unambiguous in conveying 
      universal coordinated time (UTC) 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This ties an event to a specific date and time.  Security audits 
      typically require a consistent time base, e.g., UTC, to eliminate 
      time-zone issues arising from geographical distribution.   
    
   Notes 
       
      In a distributed system, some sort of common time base, e.g., an 
      NTP[7]server, is a good implementation tactic.   
 
5.1.4 Event Outcome Indicator  
    
   Description 
       
      Required 
       
      Indicates whether the event succeeded or failed. 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Enumeration: 
    
      Value Meaning 
       ---- ---------------------------------------------------- 
        0   Success 
        4   Minor failure; action restarted, e.g., invalid password 
            with first retry 
        8   Serious failure; action terminated, e.g., invalid 
            password with excess retries 
       12   Major failure; action made unavailable, e.g., user 
            account disabled due to excessive invalid logon attempts 
       
   Rationale 
       
      Some audit events may be qualified by success or failure 
      indicator.  For example, a Logon might have this flag set to a 
      non-zero value to indicate why a logon attempt failed.

5.2  Active Participant Identification 
       
   The following data identify a user for the purpose of documenting 
   personal accountability for the audited event.  Optionally, the 
   userÆs network access location may be specified.  There may be more 
   than one user per event, e.g., in cases of actions initiated by one 
   user for other users, however only one user may be the 
   initiator/requestor for the event. 
    
5.2.1 User ID 
    
   Description 
    
      Required 
       
      Unique identifier for the user performing the event  
       
   Format / Values 
    
      Key from authentication system.  For a common message, this 
      identifier should be one known to a common authentication system 
      (e.g., single sign-on), if available.  Otherwise, it is a unique 
      value within the Audit Source ID.   
       
   Rationale 
    
      This field ties an audit event to a specific user. 
       
   Notes 
    
      For cross-system audits, especially with long retention, this user 
      identifier should permanently tie an audit event to a specific 
      user via a perpetually unique key. 
         
5.2.2 UserIsRequestor 
    
   Description 
    
      Optional 
       
      Indicator that the user is or is not the requestor-actor for the 
      audit event. 
       
   Format / Values 
    
      Boolean, default/assumed value is "true"

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

   Rationale 
    
      This value is used to distinguish between requestor-users and 
      recipient-users.  For example, one person may request a report-
      output to be sent to a another user. 
       
5.2.3 Role ID Code 
    
   Description 
    
      Optional 
       
      Specification of the role the user plays when performing the 
      event, as assigned in role-based access control security 
    
   Format / Values 
    
      Coded value, with attribute "code" valued with the role code or 
      text from authorization system. 
       
      This may reference a standard enumeration.  For such cases the XML 
      schema defines these optional attribute values: 
    
         Attribute      Value 
         -------------- --------------------------------------------  
         CodeSystem     OID reference  
         CodeSystemName Name of the coding system 
         DisplayName    The value to be used in displays and reports 
         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code 
       
   Rationale 
    
      This value ties an audited event to a userÆs role.  It is an 
      optional value that might be used to group events for analysis by 
      user functional role categories. 
       
   Notes 
    
      Many security systems are unable to produce this data, hence it is 
      optional.   
       
      For the common message, this identifier should be the one known to 
      a common authorization system, if available.  Otherwise, it is a 
      unique value within the Audit Source ID.  Consider using a 
      globally unique identifier associated with the role to avoid 
      ambiguity in auditing heterogeneous systems. 
       
      Role ID is not a substitute for personal accountability.

      Ambiguities arise from composite roles and users with multiple 
      roles, i.e., which role within a composite is being used or what 
      privilege was a user employing?   
       
5.3  Network Access Point Identification 
    
5.3.1 Network Access Point Type Code 
 
   Description 
    
      Optional 
       
      An identifier for the type of network access point that originated 
      the audit event.   
       
   Format / Values 
    
      Enumeration: 
       
         Value Meaning 
         ----- ---------------- 
           1   Machine Name 
           2   IP Address 
           3   Telephone Number 
      
   Rationale 
    
      This datum identifies the type of network access point identifier 
      of the user device for the audit event.  It is an optional value 
      that may be used to group events recorded on separate servers for 
      analysis of access according to a network access pointÆs type. 
       
5.3.2 Network Access Point ID 
    
   Description 
       
      Optional 
       
      An identifier for the network access point of the user device for 
      the audit event.  This could be a device id, IP address, or some 
      other identifier associated with a device. 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Text may be constrained to only valid values for the given Network 
      Access Point Type, if specified.  Recommendation is to be as 
      specific as possible where multiple options are available.

Security Audit and Access Accountability Message          December 2002 

   Rationale 
    
      This datum identifies the userÆs network access point, distinct 
      from the server that performed the action.  It is an optional 
      value that may be used to group events recorded on separate 
      servers for analysis of a specific network access pointÆs access 
      across all servers. 
    
   Note  
       
      Network Access Point ID is not a substitute for personal 
      accountability.  Internet IP addresses, in particular, are highly 
      volatile and may be assigned to more than one person in a short 
      time period. 
    
   Examples 
       
      Network Access Point ID: SMH4WC02 
      Network Access Point Type: 1 = Machine Name 
       
      Network Access Point ID: 10.10.203.42 
      Network Access Point Type: 2 = IP address  
       
      Network Access Point ID: 610-555-1212 
      Network Access Point Type: 3   = Phone Number  
       
5.4  Audit Source Identification 
    
   The following data are required primarily for application server 
   systems and processes.  Since multi-tier, distributed, or composite 
   applications make source identification ambiguous, this collection of 
   fields may repeat for each server or process actively involved in the 
   event.  For example, multiple value-sets can identify participating 
   web servers, application processes, and database server threads in an 
   n-tier distributed application. Passive event participants, e.g., 
   low-level network transports, need not be identified. 
    
5.4.1 Audit Enterprise Site ID 
    
   Description 
       
      Optional 
       
      Logical server location within the healthcare enterprise network, 
      e.g., a hospital or other provider location within a multi-entity  
      provider group. 
       
      This is configurable and defined by the application that generates 
      the audit record.  It contains a unique code that identifies a 
      business organization (owner of data) that is known to the

      enterprise.  The value further qualifies [disambiguates] the Audit 
      Source ID.  Values may vary depending on type of business.  There 
      may be levels of differentiation within the organization. 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Unique identifier within the healthcare enterprise.  Null value 
      when the system is uniquely identified by Audit Source ID. 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This value differentiates among the sites in a multi-site 
      enterprise health information system.  
       
5.4.2 Audit Source ID 
    
   Description 
       
      Required 
       
      Identifier of the server where event originated. 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Unique identifier, at least within the Audit Enterprise Site ID 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This field ties the event to a specific server system.  It may be 
      used to group events for analysis according to where the event 
      occurred. 
    
   Notes 
    
      In some server configurations, a load-balancing function 
      distributes work among two or more duplicate servers.  The values 
      defined for this field thus may be considered as an identifier for 
      the group of servers rather than a specific hardware system. 
       
5.4.3 Audit Source Type Code 
    
   Description 
       
      Optional 
       
      Code specifying the server type where event originated.

           8    External source, unknown type 
      
   Rationale 
       
      This field indicates which type of system is identified by the 
      Audit Source ID.  It is an optional value that may be used to 
      group events for analysis according to the type of server where 
      the event occurred. 
       
5.5  Participant Object Identification 
      
   The following data assist the auditing process by indicating specific 
   instances of data or objects that have been accessed. 
      
   These data are optional if the values for Event Identification, 
   Active Participant Identification, and Audit Source Identification 
   are sufficient to documents the entire auditable event.  In addition, 
   the production audit records containing these data may be enabled or 
   not, as determined by healthcare organization policy and regulatory 
   requirements.  
    
   Because events may have more than one participant, this group should 
   be considered a repeating set of values.  For example, depending on 
   institutional policies and implementation choices: 
    
   -  Two participant object value-sets can be used to identify access 
      to patient data by medical record number plus the specific health 
      care encounter or episode for the patient.   
   -  A patient participant and his authorized representative may be 
      identified concurrently. 
   -  An attending physician and consulting referrals may be identified 
      concurrently. 
   -  All patients identified on a worklist may be identified.

         CodeSystemName Name of the coding system 
         DisplayName    The value to be used in displays and reports 
         OriginalText   Input value that was translated to the code 
    
   Rationale 
       
      Required to distinguish among various identifiers that may 
      synonymously identify a participant object. 
    
       
5.5.5 Participant Object ID Sensitivity 
    
   Description 
       
      Optional 
       
      Denotes policy-defined sensitivities for the Participant Object ID 
      such as VIP, HIV status, mental health status, or similar topics. 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Values are institution and implementation defined text-strings. 
       
5.5.6 Participant Object ID 
    
   Description 
    
      Required 
       
      Identifies a specific instance of the participant object 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Depends on Participant Object Type Code and the Participant Object 
      ID Type Code 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This field identifies a specific instance of an object, such as a 
      patient, to detect/track privacy issues. 
    
   Notes 
       
      Consider this to be the primary unique identifier key for the 
      object, so it may be a composite data field as implemented.

5.5.7 Participant Object Name 
    
      Description 
       
      Optional 
       
      An instance-specific descriptor of the Participant Object ID 
      audited, such as a personÆs name 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Free text 
    
   Rationale 
       
      This field may be used in a query/report to identify audit events 
      for a specific person, especially if multiple synonymous 
      Participant Object IDs have been used for that person. 
       
5.5.8 Participant Object Query String 
    
   Description 
       
      Optional  
       
      The actual query string for a query-type participant object. 
    
   Format / Values 
       
      Base 64 encoded data 
    
   Rationale 
    
      For query events it may be necessary to capture the actual query 
      string input the query process in order to identify the specific 
      event.  It is a data blob, relative to auditing, that may be 
      decoded and interpreted by downstream audit analysis processing

7. Security Considerations 
    
   Audit data must be secured at least to the same extent as the 
   underlying data and activities being audited.  This includes access 
   controls as well as data integrity and recovery functions.  This 
   document acknowledges the need for, but does not specify, the 
   policies and technical methods to accomplish this. 
    
   It is conceivable that audit data might have unintended uses, e.g., 
   tracking the frequency and nature of system use for productivity 
   measures.  ASTM standard E2147-01[5] states, in paragraph 5.3.10, 
   "Prohibit use for other reasons than to enforce security and to 
   detect security breaches in record health information systems, for 
   example, the audits are not to be used to explore activity profiles 
   or movement profiles of employees.ö
