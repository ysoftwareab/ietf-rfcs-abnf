1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for allocating
   new values for the Routing Type field in the IPv6 Routing Header
   [RFC2460].  Previously, no IANA guidance existed for such
   allocations.


2.  IANA Considerations

   New Routing Type values are allocated through IETF Review or IESG
   Approval [RFC5226].

   Note that two experimental values (253 and 254) are already available
   for use [RFC4727].


3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of the
   Routing Header.  However, past experience shows that it is easy to
   design routing headers that have significant problems [RFC5095].
