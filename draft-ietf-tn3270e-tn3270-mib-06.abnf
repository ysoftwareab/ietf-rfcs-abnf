TimeStamp = A 4-octet field representing the number of
                    TimeTicks since the TN3270E server was last
                    activated.  The server's last activation time
                    is available in the tn3270eSrvrConfLastActTime
                    object in the TN3270E MIB, which has the
                    syntax DateAndTime.
