                   draft-iana-rfc-inventory-report-00

Abstract

   This RFC archives the report on the ICANN/IANA "RFC Inventory"
   Project.  This project examined older RFCs for "IANA Actions", that
   is, actions that need to be performed by ICANN/IANA as part of the
   protocol parameters portion of the IANA Functions Contract, that were
   not completed, not properly referenced or, in some other fashion,
   required re-examination for incomplete IANA Actions.  The goal was to
   ensure that, for all RFCs, the IANA Actions had been identified and
   completed as accurately as possible.

   In order to ensure that this report is available in a format that is
   accessible to the IETF, this RFC is available in two formats: an
   ASCII format which contains a summary of the graphics and charts
   contained in the report to the IESG; and a PDF version which contains
   all the graphics and charts in their original presentation.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

Internet-Draft         IANA RFC Inventory Project             April 2011


1.  Summary

   This paper summarizes the results of the ICANN/IANA "RFC Inventory"
   Project.  This project examined older RFCs for "IANA Actions", that
   is, actions that need to be performed by ICANN/IANA as part of the
   protocol parameters portion of the IANA Functions Contract, that were
   not completed, not properly referenced or, in some other fashion,
   required re-examination for incomplete IANA Actions.  The goal was to
   ensure that, for all RFCs, the IANA Actions had been identified and
   completed as accurately as possible.

   In simple terms, the project was intended to "inventory all published
   RFCs that called for the creation of registries, and requests for
   Ports and PENS to verify that there are no uncompleted work items . .
   .".  The project was executed in three phases with the final phase
   completed in February 2010.

   ICANN/IANA and a group of technical experts from the IETF community
   separated the RFCs into tickets based on an initial analysis of
   whether IANA Actions were still required for the older RFCs.  In
   those cases where follow-up work was required, ICANN/IANA used its
   ticketing system to systematically track the effort of analyzing,
   repairing and reporting on the changes needed to bring the protocol
   parameter registries maintained by ICANN/IANA ("IANA Registries")
   into alignment with the requirements of the RFCs.

   Of the 4,500 RFCs examined, 430 tickets were created for detailed
   follow-up.  For each one of these tickets, ICANN/IANA needed to
   provide the reviewers of the documents sufficient time to carefully
   analyze the published RFC and compare the requested actions with the
   current IANA Registries.  Fully two-thirds of the tickets identified
   for further review and examination resulted in modifications to
   existing IANA Registries or creation of new registries.  The extent
   of the improvements to the IANA Matrix and underlying registries
   cannot be overestimated: the IETF community can have much more
   confidence that the IANA Registries represent the full intent of all
   authors of RFCs throughout the Internet's history.  Registries
   created as part of this project were created in the new XML format
   being used for all new IANA Registries.

   This project has also confirmed that the process that ICANN/IANA now
   uses for document review will ensure that the problems of the past
   are not duplicated.  The quality control and close cooperation
   between ICANN/IANA and document authors helps ensure that the chances
   of missing actions are minimized.  ICANN/IANA intends to adapt much
   of what it has learned in the RFC Inventory project into its ongoing
   Business Excellence program.

   There remain a small but important set of follow-up activities that
   are outcomes of the RFC Inventory work.  These are documented in this
   report and progress is already being made on completing these
   remaining tasks.

   The report on the project was originally submitted to the IESG in PDF
   format.  As a result, this RFC is available in both ASCII (which
   contains a summary of the charts and graphics) and in PDF (which
   contains the the summary and a copy of all charts and graphics).  In
   the case of a conflict between the summary and the original graphics,
   the graphics take precedence.


2.  Project History and Overview

   The RFC Inventory Project intended to examine older RFCs for IANA
   Actions that were not completed, not properly referenced or, in some
   other fashion, required re-examination for incomplete IANA Actions.
   The goal was to ensure that, for all RFCs, the IANA Actions had been
   identified and completed as accurately as possible.

   In the 2007 Service Level Agreement between ICANN/IANA and the IAOC
   for the IETF work there was a stated commitment to "inventory all
   published RFCs that called for the creation of registries, and
   requests for Ports and PENS to verify that there are no uncompleted
   work items . . ."

   It is worth noting that the "IANA Considerations" section has been a
   part of RFCs since RFC2434 [2] was published in October 1998.  RFC
   2434 was the first document to discuss the need for an IANA
   Considerations section: effectively a set of directions from the IETF
   community to the IANA Functions operator on what actions needed to
   take place upon publication of the RFC.

   Enforcement of the requirement that each RFC have an accurate IANA
   Considerations documents only started in 2002.  It is ICANN/IANA's
   experience that, since 2002, RFC Authors, Working Group chairs, and
   the IESG all help ensure effective IANA Considerations sections.

2.1.  Motivation for the Project

   The idea for the RFC Inventory Project came from a gradual
   realization that older RFCs did not have a systematic way of
   describing the actions ICANN/IANA needed to complete upon publication
   of those RFCs.  The IETF-IANA Working Group provided the impetus for
   the project by directing ICANN/IANA to identify the work that needed
   to be completed and then committing the resources to updating the
   ICANN/IANA Registries.

   Both ICANN/IANA and the IESG recognized the potential for older RFCs
   to have IANA Registry requirements located in the details of the RFC
   rather than separated out in an easily identified section.  Going
   through the database of older RFCs and identifying any incomplete
   IANA Actions would effectively ensure that all of the RFC library
   would have had IANA Actions properly identified and implemented.  The
   goal of having an accurate and complete set of ICANN/IANA Registries
   was a common goal of both IANA and the IESG.

2.2.  How the Project Was Carried Out

   The RFC Inventory Project was executed in three distinct phases:

   o  Phase 1 - Data Gathering - In the initial phase, all of the early
      RFCs were examined in an attempt to identify those that had
      incomplete IANA Actions.  In this phase ICANN/IANA identified
      knowledgeable people from the IETF community who could take groups
      of the early RFCs and examine them.  In cases where the expert was
      able to identify incomplete IANA Actions, those were noted.  In
      cases where it was unclear, the RFC was marked for further,
      detailed examination at a later time.

   o  Phase 2 - Ticket Creation - For all of those RFCs where subsequent
      follow-up was required, ICANN/IANA created an entry in the IANA
      departmental ticketing system.  The goal of creating these tickets
      was to track the ongoing work of ensuring that the follow-up for
      each of the IANA Actions was completed.

   o  Phase 3 - Resolving the Tickets and Reporting on the Results -
      Once the queue of IANA Action tickets had been created, ICANN/IANA
      gradually resolved those tickets.  In cooperation with experts
      from the IETF community, ICANN/IANA ended up dividing those
      tickets into four major groups:

      *  Those RFCs that needed no further IANA Action;

      *  Those RFCs that needed changes made to the IANA Matrix;

      *  Those RFCs that needed changes made to existing registries;
         and,

      *  Those RFCs that required entirely new registries.

   The SLA between ICANN/IANA and the IAOC noted that, "in 2008, IANA
   completed the second phase of the RFC Inventory project.  This phase
   included initiating communications for all tickets created where
   there were actions needing to be fulfilled or clarified.  Phase three
   of the RFC Inventory project will be closure of all tickets created

   and therefore the end of the project."

   RFCs 1-4500 were reviewed to find any IANA Actions that were not
   completed at the time of publication.  Incomplete actions included
   typos, reference updates, and missing registries.  As part of the
   deliverables for the 2008 and 2009 SLAs, ICANN/IANA provided status
   reports on the project.

   The RFC Inventory project was a multi-year project due to a few
   factors.  Due to the large amount of documents that required review,
   ICANN/IANA needed to provide the reviewers of the documents
   sufficient time to carefully analyze the document and compare the
   actions with the current IANA Registries.  All the information was
   gathered and tickets were created for follow-up on documents that
   appeared to have incomplete actions or need further review.  When
   contacting Area Directors, Working Group Chairs, experts and
   individuals, ICANN/IANA was relying on their response to be able to
   move forward with actions.  The volunteers that ICANN/IANA was
   relying on to supply information and decisions had to balance their
   inquires with their normal day-to-day activities and
   responsibilities.  ICANN/IANA staff also had to balance time spent on
   this project with keeping the response times for day-to-day work
   items within goal times as outlined in the SLA for IETF work.

   By 2008 ICANN/IANA had reviewed the results of the data for all RFCs
   and created action tickets to perform the incomplete actions or
   modifications.  A total of 430 tickets have been created for the
   project.  Figure 1 shows the total number of RFC Inventory Tickets
   broken down by RFC number range.  The figure shows the largest
   concentration of RFC Inventory Tickets in the range 2001 to 3000.

            Table 1: RFC Inventory Tickets by RFC Number Range

   The pace at which the RFC Inventory tickets were closed - that is,
   the number of tickets that completed the process of detailed
   examination, assessment of any IANA Actions required, and then
   closure - was especially intense in the months of February through
   July of 2009.  The following chart shows the monthly rates for ticket
   closure for the RFC Inventory project.  Figure 2 shows the number of
   resolved tickets in IANA's RFC Inventory Queue between 1 February
   2008 and 1 January 2010.  The period in which the largest number of
   tickets were resolved was in the period between 1 February 2009 and 1
   September 2009.

3.  Key Findings

   Examining the RFC database, the community of knowledgeable technical
   experts identified 430 RFCs for follow-up action after initial review
   of those RFCs.  These RFCs were assigned, one to a ticket, for
   further analysis and action.

          |   Major Category for Tickets   | Number of Tickets |
          +--------------------------------+-------------------+
          |     Resolve with no action     |        195        |

          +--------------------------------+-------------------+

   Table 3: Major Actions for All Tickets in the RFC Inventory  Project

   Looking at the major activities of the RFC Inventory Project there
   are some large scale findings that can be reported:

   o  Of the 430 tickets (representing RFCs to be examined and acted
      upon) created, 195 were resolved with no further action needed on
      the part of ICANN/IANA (representing 45.3% of the tickets);

   o  145 of the tickets required updates to the IANA Matrix (33.7%);

   o  In 221 of the tickets, examination of the RFC resulted in changes
      to existing IANA Registries (51.4% of the tickets); and,

   o  20 of the tickets resulted in the creation of new registries
      (4.7%).

   It is apparent, looking at the high level statistics above, that the
   effort to complete and repair older RFC's IANA Actions was worth the
   effort.  Fully two-thirds of the tickets identified for further
   follow-up and examination resulted in modifications to existing IANA
   Registries or creation of new registries.  The extent of the
   improvements to the IANA Matrix and underlying registries cannot be
   overestimated: the IETF community can have much more confidence that
   the IANA Registries represent the full intent of all authors of RFCs
   throughout the Internet's history.

   Key states for the tickets:

   o  Resolve with No Action: This outcome was reached when the
      suggested action or inquiry was verified with an Area Director,
      Working Group Chair and/or expert and it was determined that the
      suggested actions did not need to be completed or that the current
      status of the registry involved was clear and correct.

   o  Updates to IANA Matrix: This included addition, removal or
      modification to entries in the IANA Matrix, also changes to the
      registration procedures and references.

Internet-Draft         IANA RFC Inventory Project             April 2011


   o  Changes to Existing Registries: This included the addition,
      removal or modification of registrations in existing IANA
      Registries, also changes to the registration procedures and
      references.

   o  Registries Created: Either new stand-alone registries or sub-
      registries in existing registries needed to be created.

3.1.  The State of Elderly RFCs

   In examining the statistics for RFCs it is natural to look at the
   IANA Actions from older RFCs.  A useful question is: have the
   repository of older RFCs been a contributor to significant changes to
   the IANA Registries?

          +--------------------------------+-------------------+
          |          Action Taken          | Number of Tickets |
          +--------------------------------+-------------------+
          |     Resolve with no action     |         16        |
          |     Updates to IANA Matrix     |         37        |
          | Changes to existing registries |         18        |
          |       Registries created       |         0         |
          +--------------------------------+-------------------+

          Table 4: Major IANA Actions for RFCs Numbered 1 - 2000

   In this chart we see the same analysis of major activities that was
   provided in Figure 1 for all the tickets.  There were only 52 tickets
   for RFCs numbered in the range between 1 and 2000.  It is worth
   remembering that RFC2000 [3] was published in 1997.  This represents
   12 percent of the total number of tickets that the IETF expert
   community considered needed follow-up.  It also represents only 2.6%
   of the total number of the RFCs numbered between 1 through 2000.
   This seems to indicate, at first glance, that the large majority of
   RFCs in that range had their IANA Actions executed properly, or had
   no IANA Actions at all.

   What is also notable is that older RFCs were deficient in one
   significant place: older RFCs had a preponderance of missing or
   incorrect data in the IANA Matrix.  In percentage terms, the number
   of tickets related to older RFCs that are resolved with changes to
   the IANA Matrix more than doubles when compared to all 430 tickets in
   the project.

3.2.  RFCs that Needed No New Actions

   During Phase 1 of the RFC Inventory Project, RFCs were identified
   that had explicit needs for IANA Actions or where further analysis by



McFadden & Cotton       Expires October 26, 2011               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         IANA RFC Inventory Project             April 2011


   the IETF community was required.  In many cases, detailed analysis of
   those RFCs which had been passed along for further review showed that
   no further action was required.  Many tickets in this group were
   reviewed by the authors or, in some cases, the appropriate Area
   Director, to validate that the conclusion that there was no further
   action required.

            +-----------------------------+-------------------+
            |      Examination Status     | Number of Tickets |
            +-----------------------------+-------------------+
            |     Total RFCs Examined     |        4500       |
            | Total Tickets for Follow-up |        431        |
            |  Tickets with IANA Actions  |        195        |
            +-----------------------------+-------------------+

                   Table 5: Tickets with No IANA Actions

   There were 430 RFC Inventory tickets generated in Phase 1 of the
   project.  Of those, 195 (45.3%) were found to not need further work
   by ICANN/IANA.  This leaves 236 tickets that have been identified
   that required further action.  While this may appear to be a small
   percentage of all 4,500 RFCs examined, this does show that a
   significant percentage (54.7%) of those documents that needed
   follow-up actually required further action.

3.3.  RFCs that Needed Changes Made to the IANA Matrix

   Many tickets required a variety of changes to IANA Registries and
   other reference materials.  Specifically, ICANN/IANA maintains an
   index to all of the IANA Registries called the IANA Matrix.  Located
   at http://www.iana.org/protocols/, the IANA Matrix indicates the name
   of the protocol registry, the document that defines the registry and
   the registration procedures.

   Because the IANA Matrix is a separate index from the protocol
   registries, it is very possible for one of the RFC Inventory tickets
   to result in both a change to the registry and a change to the IANA
   Matrix.

   In total, out of the 236 tickets that were identified as requiring
   further IANA action, 94 resulted in updates or new entries in the
   IANA Matrix.  Because of the nature of some of the RFCs that were
   examined, there were RFCs that resulted in more than one change to
   the IANA Matrix.  However, the vast majority of those tickets that
   resulted in IANA Matrix updates only required a single change to the
   Matrix.  In total, there were 131 updates to the IANA Matrix as a
   result of this work.

Internet-Draft         IANA RFC Inventory Project             April 2011


3.4.  RFCs that Updated IANA Registries

   Arguably one of the most important tasks of the project was to
   identify RFCs that had not had their IANA Actions completed in full.
   Of the 238 tickets that were identified as requiring further IANA
   action, 179 resulted in changes to one or more protocol parameter
   registries.

   Detailed analysis of the RFCs sometimes found that more than one
   registry needed maintenance as a result of the project.  While the
   vast majority of tickets resulted in maintenance to a single IANA
   Registry, several caused maintenance to be applied to multiple
   registries.

    +---------------------------------------------+-------------------+
    | Total Registries Changed During Examination | Number of Tickets |
    +---------------------------------------------+-------------------+
    |             One registry changed            |        137        |
    |            Two registries changed           |         26        |
    |           Three registries changed          |         13        |
    |           Four registries changed           |         2         |
    |           Five registries changed           |         1         |
    +---------------------------------------------+-------------------+

    Table 6: How Many IANA Registries were Changed by Examining an RFC?

   It is worth noting that 77.5% of the tickets that resulted in active
   examination of RFCs resulted in one or more changes to IANA
   Registries.  Looking at the bigger picture: when Phase 1 of the
   project was completed 430 RFCs had been identified for follow-up
   examination.  By the time Phase 3 was complete, 41.5% resulted in, at
   least, one change to an existing IANA protocol parameter registry.

   In addition to registrations and other parameter-related information
   in IANA Registries, there is also reference material.  Each registry
   is supposed to have accurate internal references and clear
   definitions of registration procedures.  For every ticket that was
   actively under examination nearly one in six resulted in a change to
   the documented registration procedures.  On average - across the
   entire project - each active ticket resulted in at least one change
   in the registries references.  It is important to note that this
   number was spread out significantly across the 430 tickets (that is,
   many tickets resulted in a substantial number of reference updates,
   while others had none).

    Table 7: Modifications for Registration Procedures and  References

   A listing of all registries that were modified as part of the project
   is in Appendix A.

3.5.  RFCs that Created Entirely New Registries

   Another important category of changes that resulted from the project
   was the discovery that some registries had not been created as a
   result of publication of the RFC.  It turns out that this is a rare
   event.  After examining 4500 RFCs and doing detailed examination of
   430 of those, only 20 new IANA Registries were to be created as part
   of the project.  It is important to note that some of these
   registries were not created after direction from experts and Area
   Directors.

   One aspect of this category of improvements is that often the new
   registries were actually sub-registries of an existing registry (for
   example, sub-registries in the SIP registry).  A smaller number were
   new standalone registries, e.g.:

      /keynote/keynote.xhtml

      /dcap-parameters/dcap-parameters.xhtml

      /rtfm/rtfm.xhtml

      /slp-da-service/slp-da-service.xhtml

   In addition, several new subregistries were created as part of the
   project.  Here is a list of those subregistries:

      For RFC2097 [4], 2 sub-registries were created within an existing
      registry (Existing registry:
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp-numbers)

         'Added' field (value 1)

         Sub-registry: NBFCP Configuration Options - Peer-Information
         (value 2)

      For RFC2114 [5], 2 sub-registries were created within an existing
      registry (Existing registry: http://www.iana.org/assignments/
      dcap-parameters/dcap-parameters.xhtml)

         Sub-registry: Data Link Switching Protocol Frame Codes

         Sub-registry: Data Link Switching Protocol Sender Capability
         Codes

      For RFC2704 [6], 3 sub-registries were created within an existing
      registry (Existing registry:
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/keynote/keynote.xhtml)

         Sub-Registry: KeyNote app_domain Identifiers

         Sub-Registry: KeyNote Public Key Format Identifiers

         Sub-Registry: KeyNote Signature Algorithm Identifiers

      For RFC3588 [7], 2 sub-registries were created within an existing
      registry (Existing registry:
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtfm/rtfm.xhtml)

         Sub-Registry: Pattern Matching Engine (PME) Opcodes

         Sub-Registry: RTFM Attributes

      For RFC4090 [8], 1 sub-registry sub-registries was created within
      an existing registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
      rsvp-te-parameters/rsvp-te-parameters.xhtml)

         Sub-registry: Record Route Object Sub-object Flags

   Registries created as part of this project were created in the new
   XML format being used for all new IANA Registries.  In addition, the
   RFC Inventory project generated three errata submitted to the RFC-
   Editor.

   The current status of the errata are as follows:

      RFC3611 [10], Errata ID 1759, Status: Verified

      RFC4301 [11], Errata ID 1713, Status: Held for Document Update

3.6.  ICANN/IANA Assessment of Current State of IANA Registries

   The RFC Inventory Project has successfully identified many RFCs whose
   IANA Actions were not completed, or only partially completed.  The
   project has also identified errors in the underlying registries and
   added significant amounts of reference information for future users
   of the registries.

   As a quality control measure, ICANN/IANA intends to adapt much of
   what it has learned in the RFC Inventory project into its ongoing
   Business Excellence program.  ICANN/IANA believes that the RFC
   Inventory project has not only resulted in a significant improvement
   in the quality of the registries now in place at ICANN/IANA, but has
   also improved the processing of new IANA-related requirements in
   future RFCs.

   Today, documents go through many stages of review for IANA-related
   requirements before they become RFCs.  For example:

      Pre-review of the document as an I-D and initial consultation with
      an author;

      Last Call examination of the I-D;

      Evaluation

      Approval where actions are completed and signed-off by the authors
      of the document; and,

      IANA Actions double checked against the published RFC when
      references are updated with the final RFC number.

   Before 2004, there was no formal process for the consultations,
   reviews and documentation by ICANN/IANA for Internet-Drafts intended
   to become RFCs.  The situation is very different now.  The chances of
   authors missing actions have been lowered due to the extensive
   coordination with authors, Working Group chairs and Area Directors.
   This helps ensure that authors carefully consider if they need any
   IANA Actions as part of their documents.

   With continual improvements to the guidance to authors - starting
   with RFC2434 [2], and now RFC5226 [12] - it is increasingly clear to



McFadden & Cotton       Expires October 26, 2011               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         IANA RFC Inventory Project             April 2011


   authors what is expected in their documents in the way of IANA
   Considerations.

   The project is not intended as an activity that needs to be repeated.
   The chances of ICANN/IANA missing actions or performing incomplete
   actions per RFC have greatly been minimized due to the highly
   formalized methods of document review that have evolved in the last
   decade.


4.  Recommendations for Further Action

   When ICANN/IANA was ready to start gathering the information for this
   summary report, there were still some tickets that had incomplete
   work items.  These work items are still being tracked until
   completed.  There were also some work items that were identified as
   not required to be completed for these RFCs but that needed to be
   initiated and completed at some time in the future.  Both the
   incomplete action items and the future identified work items are
   described here.

4.1.  Incomplete Actions

   There were 11 tickets created by the RFC Inventory project whose
   actions were not completed as of January 15, 2010 (the date ICANN/
   IANA began gathering statistics for this report).  ICANN/IANA will
   continue to provide updates to the IETF-IANA WG on the status of
   these open work items.

4.1.1.  RFC4004 - Registry Problem

   This ticket is waiting for an errata to be submitted by an individual
   involved in the DIME Working Group for a missing registration.  It is
   also possible that the issue could be fixed by the publication of
   draft-ietf-dime-mip6-split17.  Once the errata has been submitted and
   confirmed or the document has been approved for publication, this
   ticket can be resolved.[13]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will follow-up with the individual on the status
   of either submitting the errata or the document status

4.1.2.  RFC1277 - Possible Missing Registries

   This ticket is waiting on subject matter experts to determine if a
   registry defined in this RFC should be created.  There is a
   preliminary decision indicating that there is not significant use of
   the protocols and directories specified in the RFC to justify setting
   up a registry.  This decision is being confirmed with other experts.

Internet-Draft         IANA RFC Inventory Project             April 2011


   After a final conclusion is made, this ticket can be resolved.[14]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will follow-up with the individuals deliberating
   to see if a decision has been made.

4.1.3.  RFC2872 - Possible Missing Registry

   A first draft of a document regarding gaps in the RSVP and IntServ
   registries is planned to be produced prior to the Anaheim IETF
   meeting.  This document would ultimately be a TSVWG working group
   item (if the WG agrees to the plan). [15]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will follow-up with the individual whom has
   offered to write the document to see if any progress has been made.

4.1.4.  RFC2124 - Possible missing registry/registries

   ICANN/IANA is trying to get in touch with an individual to determine
   if a reference should be added to a port number for its use described
   in the RFC.  Area Directors are assisting in trying to get in touch
   with this person using every means possible.  If ICANN/IANA is unable
   to reach the individual, guidance as to a final decision will be
   requested from the Area Directors.  [16]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will attempt to contact the individual again.  If
   the final attempt is not successful, ICANN/IANA will consult with the
   Area Directors.

4.1.5.  RFC2023 - Reference Update

   ICANN/IANA is checking with some Area Directors and individuals to
   determine if a reference should be added to some parameters in the
   PPP Numbers registry.  A new person was suggested to contact and
   ICANN/IANA is pursuing that individual.  If no response is received
   then ICANN/IANA will request a decision from the Area Directors
   regarding the reference update.  [17]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will attempt to contact the new suggested person
   for assistance

4.1.6.  RFC1833 - Matrix Updae, Reference Update

   The NFSv4 chairs have been given the task of identifying the
   registration procedures for the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
   Parameters registry.  After the registration procedures are
   identified the registry and matrix will require updating.  [18]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will inquire with the NFSv4 chairs on the status.

4.1.7.  RFC1813 - Possible incorrect reference

   ICANN/IANA has inquired with Area Directors, Working Group chairs and
   individuals about a possible reference correction in the GSSAPI/
   Kerberos/SASL Service Names registry.  The request was passed to the
   NFSv4 chairs for input.  [19]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will inquire with the NFSv4 chairs if this
   reference update should be completed.

4.1.8.  RFC3519 - Matrix Update

   It was determined that after revising the registry in preparation for
   XMLization, the matrix issues would be resolved.  ICANN/IANA has been
   working with a mobileip expert to revise the registry and make
   corrections/additions where needed.  Revisions of the registry are in
   the final review stages.  Once the new registry has been published on
   the website this ticket can be resolved.  [20]

   Action: ICANN/IANA to complete the registry revision.

4.1.9.  RFC3082 - Possible Registry Updates

   ICANN/IANA is inquiring with Area Directors and experts regarding if
   registrations should be added to the SLP Extension Value registries
   and a reference to the port numbers registry.  [21]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will follow-up with the individuals to obtain a
   response.  If no response is received ICANN/IANA will request further
   assistance from the IESG.

4.1.10.  RFC2217 - Possible Missing Registry

   The Area Director suggested that an option for this would be for a
   RFC to be written to create the registry and identify the
   registration procedures.  Two individuals were sent inquires to see
   if they would be interested in this work item.  [22]

   Action: ICANN/IANA will follow-up with the suggested individuals to
   see if they would be willing to write the document and/or if they
   feel the document is needed.

4.1.11.  RFC2409 - Matrix Update, Registry Update

   Registry and matrix updates are needed for the ipsec-registry.  It
   was determined that in preparation for xmlization of the registry the
   revisions would resolve the issues identified in this ticket.  [23]

   Action: ICANN/IANA to complete the registry revision

4.2.  Other Related Activities

4.2.1.  Move RFC 2754 to Historic Status

   During the review it was decided that RFC2754 should be moved to
   Historic Status.  Its IANA Actions were never taken and would now be
   impractical to implement.  Mark McFadden has authored an Internet
   Draft (currently, draft-iana-rfc2754-to-historic-00) to accomplish
   this.  [24]

4.2.2.  Draft RFC2978bis

   During the review it was noted that a revision to RFC 2978 needed to
   be done.  The revision needs to make it clear that each entry in the
   IANA Charsets registry must have a single recommended MIME charset
   label following RFC 2046 syntax, state whether it is suitable for the
   MIME text, have a reference to a formal specification or translation
   table to Unicode.  Mark McFadden is in the process of drafting such a
   revision for RFC 2978 and there will be discussions about the draft
   at IETF-77.  [25]

4.2.3.  PKIX Security Mechanisms

   Pearl Liang noted that Russ Housley, or someone he suggests, will
   write an Internet Draft to organize the security mechanisms for PKIX
   once the maintenance shifts from the PKIX Working Group.  Pearl Liang
   noted this in the ticket for RFC4334 [26].

4.2.4.  Fix for PPP BAP Extensions

   During the work on the RFC Inventory it was discovered that the IANA
   Registry for PPP BAP Extensions was deficient.  To correct this, Jari
   Arkko has joined with Jim Carlson and Amanda Baber to create an IANA
   BAP Rules Internet Draft (currently,
   draft-arkko-pppext-bap-ianafix-02).

4.2.5.  RFC3588bis

   The ticket for RFC3588 [7] was eventually resolved with no IANA
   Action because creation of 3588bis is in process.  During the expert
   review of this ticket, the authors and community could not decide if
   a new registry for NAPTR service fields should be created within the
   existing registry /s-naptr-parameters/s-naptr-parameters.xhtml; or
   created as a stand-alone brand new registry called NAPTR service
   fields (/naptr-svr-fields/naptr-svr-fields.xhtml).  This is being
   left to the community during the discussions of RFC 3588bis.
