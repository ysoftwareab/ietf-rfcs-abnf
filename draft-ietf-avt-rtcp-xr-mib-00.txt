Abstract


   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Real-Time Transport 
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) VoIP Metrics (RFC3611).

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Overview


   An "RTP System" may be a host end-system that runs an application
   program that sends or receives RTP data packets, or it may be an
   intermediate-system that forwards RTP packets.  RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) packets are sent by senders and receivers to convey
   information about RTP packet transmission and reception [RFC3550].
   RTP monitors may collect RTCP information on senders and receivers to
   and from an RTP host or intermediate-system.


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.1 Components


   The RTCP XR MIB is structured around "Session," "Receiver" and 
   "Sender" conceptual abstractions.


   2.1.1  An RTP Session is an association of two or more participants
   communicating with RTP.  For each participant, the session is defined
   by a particular pair of destination transport addresses (one network
   address plus a port pair for RTP and RTCP).  The destination
   transport addresses may be common for all participants, as in the
   case of IP multicast, or may be different for each, as in the case of
   individual unicast addresses plus a common port pair," as defined in
   section 3 of [RFC3550].


   2.1.2 A "Sender" is identified within an RTP session by a 32-bit
   numeric "Synchronization Source," or "SSRC", value and is "...the
   source of a stream of RTP packets" as defined in section 3 of
   [RFC3550].  The sender is also a source of RTCP Sender Report packets
   as specified in section 6 of [RFC3550].


   2.1.3 A "Receiver" of a "stream of RTP packets" can be a unicast or
   multicast Receiver as described in 2.1.1, above.  An RTP Receiver has
   an SSRC value that is unique to the session.  An RTP Receiver is a
   source of RTCP Receiver Reports as specified in section 6 of
   [RFC3550].

2.2 Applicability of the MIB to RTP System Implementations


   The RTCP XR MIB may be used in RTP Host Systems (end systems), see
   section 3 of [RFC3550] that are supporting Voice over IP (VoIP host
   systems).


   2.2.1 VoIP host Systems are end-systems that may use the RTCP XR MIB 
   to collect RTP Voice over IP session data that the host is sending or
   receiving; these data may be used by a network manager to detect and
   diagnose faults that occur over the lifetime of a VoIP session as in
   a "help-desk" scenario.


   2.2.2 Monitors of RTP Voice over IP sessions may be third-party or
   may be located in the RTP host.  Monitors may use the RTCP XR MIB to
   collect Voice over IP session statistical data; these data may be
   used by a network manager for planning and other network-management
   purposes.  A Monitor may use the RTCP XR MIB to collect data to 
   permit a network manager to diagnose faults in VoIP sessions.


   2.2.3 Many host systems will want to keep track of streams beyond
   what they are sending and receiving.  In a host monitor system, a
   host agent would use RTP data from the host to maintain data about
   streams it is sending and receiving, and RTCP data to collect data
   about other hosts in the session.  


2.3  The Structure of the RTCP XR MIB


   There is one table in the RTCP XR MIB.  The rtpXrVoipTable contains
   objects that describe completed sessions at the host or monitor.  


   rtpXrVoipIndex is a global object that permits a network management
   application to obtain a unique index for conceptual row creation 
   in the rtpSessionTable.  In this way the SNMP Set operation MAY 
   be used to configure a monitor.

4.  Security Considerations


   In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP
   security is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view
   information about a system, or to change some parameter at the
   system, is a tool, not a threat.  


   None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, though
   some SDES [RFC3550] items such as the CNAME [RFC3550], the canonical
   name, may be deemed sensitive depending on the security policies of a
   particular enterprise.  If access to these objects is not limited by
   an appropriate access control policy, these objects can provide an
   attacker with information about a system's configuration and the
   services that that system is providing.  Some enterprises view their
   network and system configurations, as well as information about usage
   and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to
   restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.  


   Confidentiality of RTP and RTCP data packets is defined in section 9
   of the RTP specification [RFC3550].  Encryption may be performed on
   RTP packets, RTCP packets, or both.  Encryption of RTCP packets may
   pose a problem for third-party monitors though "For RTCP, it is
   allowed to split a compound RTCP packet into two lower-layer packets,
   one to be encrypted and one to be sent in the clear.  For example,
   SDES information might be encrypted while reception reports were sent
   in the clear to accommodate third-party monitors [RFC3550]."


   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  It is
   recommended that the implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
   User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.  It is then a
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving
   access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
