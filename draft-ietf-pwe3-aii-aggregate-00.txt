     Abstract 

        The signaling protocols used to establish point-to-point pseudowires 
        include type-length-value (TLV) fields that identify pseudowire 
        endpoints called attachment individual identifiers (AII). This 
        document defines AII structures in the form of new AII type-length-
        value fields that support AII aggregation for improved scalability 
        and VPN autodiscovery. It is envisioned that this would be useful in 
        large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where 
        pseudowires are established between selected local and remote PE 
        nodes based on customer need.

     1. Introduction 

        [PWE3-CONTROL] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing 
        point-to-point pseudowires (PWs) between two provider edge (PE) 
        nodes. When a PW is set up, the LDP signaling messages include a 
        forwarding equivalence class (FEC) element containing information 
        about the PW type and an endpoint identifier used in the selection of

     Internet-Draft        AII Types for Aggregation          September 2005 
         

        the PW forwarder that binds the PW to the attachment circuit at each 
        end. 

        There are two types of FEC elements defined for this purpose: PWid 
        FEC (type 128) and the Generalized ID (GID) FEC (type 129). The PWid 
        FEC element includes a fixed-length 32 bit value called the PWid that 
        serves as an endpoint identifier. The same PWid value must be 
        configured on the local and remote PE prior to PW setup. 

        The GID FEC element includes TLV fields for attachment individual 
        identifiers (AII) that, in conjunction with an attachment group 
        identifier (AGI), serve as PW endpoint identifiers. The endpoint 
        identifier on the local PE (denoted as <AGI, source AII or SAII) is 
        called the source attachment identifier (SAI) and the endpoint 
        identifier on the remote PE (denoted as <AGI, target AII or TAII) is 
        called the target attachment identifier (TAI). The SAI and TAI can be 
        distinct values. This is useful for applications and provisioning 
        models where the local PE (with a particular SAI) does not know and 
        must somehow learn (e.g. via MP-BGP auto-discovery) of remote TAI 
        values prior to launching PW setup messages towards the remote PE. 

        The use of the GID FEC TLV provides the flexibility to structure 
        (source or target) AII values to best fit particular application or 
        provisioning model needs [L2VPN-SIG]. For example an AII structure 
        that enables many individual AII values to be identified as a single 
        value could significantly reduce the burden on AII distribution 
        mechanisms (e.g. MP-BGP) and on PE memory needed to store this AII 
        information. It should be noted that PWE3 signaling messages will 
        always include a fully qualified AII value.  

        An AII that is globally unique would facilitate PW management and 
        security in large inter-AS and inter-provider environments. Providers 
        would not have to worry about AII value overlap during provisioning 
        or the need for AII network address translation (NAT) boxes during 
        signaling. Globally unique AII values could aid in troubleshooting 
        and could be subjected to source-validity checks during AII 
        distribution and signaling. An AII automatically derived from a 
        provider’s existing IP address space can simplify the provisioning 
        process.  

        This document defines an AII structure based on [PWE3-CONTROL] that: 

        o  Enables many discrete attachment individual identifiers to be 
           summarized into a single AII summary value. This will enhance 
           scalability by reducing the burden on AII distribution mechanisms 
           and on PE memory.

     Internet-Draft        AII Types for Aggregation          September 2005 
         

        o  Ensures global uniqueness if desired by the provider. This will 
           facilitate Internet-wide PW connectivity and provide a means for 
           providers to perform source validation on the AII distribution 
           (e.g. MP-BGP) and signaling (e.g. LDP) channels. 
            

        This is accomplished by defining new AII types and the associated 
        formats of the value field. 

     2. Structure for the New AII Type 

        [PWE3-CONTROL] defines the format of the GID FEC TLV and the use and 
        semantics of the attachment group identifier (AGI). 
         

     2.1. AII Type 1 

        AII Type 1 has been allocated by IANA for use with provisioning 
        models requiring a fixed-length 32-bit value [L2VPN-SIG]. This value 
        is unique on the local PE.  
          
         
     2.2. AII Type 2 

        The AII Type 2 structure permits varying levels of AII summarization 
        to take place thus reducing the scaling burden on the aforementioned 
        AII distribution mechanisms and PE memory. In other words it no 
        longer becomes necessary to distribute or configure all individual 
        AII values (which could number in the tens of thousands or more) on 
        local PEs prior to establishing PWs to remote PEs. The details of how 
        and where the aggregation of AII values is performed and then 
        distributed as AII reachability information are not discussed in this 
        document.  

        AII Type 2 uses a combination of a provider’s globally unique 
        identifier (Global ID), a 32-bit prefix field and an optional 4-octet 
        attachment circuit identifier field to create globally unique AII 
        values.  

        The encoding of AII Type 2 is shown in figure 1.

        o  AII Type = 0x02 
            

        o  Length = length of value field in octets. The length is set to 8 
           if the AC ID is NULL and 12 if the AC ID is non-null. 

        o  Global ID = This is a 4 octet field containing a value that is 
           unique to the provider. The global ID can contain the 2 octet or 4 
           octet value of the provider’s Autonomous System Number (ASN). It 
           is expected that the global ID will be derived from the globally 
           unique ASN of the autonomous system hosting the PEs containing the 
           actual AIIs. The presence of a global ID based on the provider’s 
           ASN ensures that the AII will be globally unique.  
            
           If the PE hosting the AIIs is present in an autonomous system 
           where the provider is not running BGP, chooses not to expose this 
           information or does not wish to use the global ID, then the global 
           ID field MUST be set to zero. If the global ID is derived from a 
           2-octet AS number, then the high-order 4 octets of this 4 octet 
           field MUST be set to zero. 
            
           Please note that the use of the provider’s ASN as a global ID DOES 
           NOT have anything at all to do with the use of the ASN in 
           protocols such as BGP.

        o  Prefix = The 32-bit prefix is a value assigned by the provider or 
           it can be automatically derived from the PE’s /32 IPv4 loopback 
           address. Note that it is not required that the 32-bit prefix have 
           any association with the IPv4 address space used in the provider’s 
           IGP or BGP for IP reachability. 
            

        o  Attachment Circuit (AC) ID = This is a fixed length four octet 
           field used to further refine identification of an attachment 
           circuit on the PE. The inclusion of the AC ID is used to identify 
           individual attachment circuits that share a common prefix.  
            
           If the AC ID is not present then the AC ID field MUST be null and 
           the AII Length field is set to 8. If the AC ID is present then the 
           length field is set to 12 octets. 

         

     3. IANA Considerations 

        This document requests that IANA allocate a value from the  
        "Attachment Individual Identifier (AII) Type" registry defined in 
        [IANA]. 

        The suggested value for this AII type is 0x02. 
         

     4. Security Considerations 

        AII values appear in AII distribution protocols [MP-BGP-AUTO-DISC] 
        and PW signaling protocols [PWE3-CONTROL] and are subject to various 
        authentication schemes (i.e. MD5) if so desired.  
         
        The use of global ID values (e.g. ASN) in the inter-provider case 
        could enable a form of source-validation checking to ensure that the 
        AII value (aggregated or explicit) originated from a legitimate 
        source.
