INTERNET-DRAFT  MIB-Controlled ATM Accounting Management February 1996

1.0  Introduction

This document consolidates several proposals (listed below in reference 
section 6) on logging for ATM accounting management support. It also 
proposes new MIB objects (as supplements to the AToM MIB) that relate 
to the accounting information items to be logged, and proposes MIB 
control objects to facilitate logging.

The intent is to support basic accounting requirements listed in 
section 2.0, and to define information items and control MIB objects 
for logging; additional functionality may be defined in enterprise-
specific vendor MIB modules.

Accounting management is a key consideration for service providers, 
who have voiced the need for ATM PVC and SVC accounting information 
support in the AToM MIB for several reasons, including the following:

1.  Without a common specification of the accounting data items and 
log file structure, accounting management would have to be handled in
a vendor-dependent manner, and service providers would have to develop
customized software for each switch vendor to integrate the switches 
into the service provider's accounting management system. 
Specifying the data items and log structure in the AToM MIB would 
foster data consistency across switch vendors and greatly facilitate 
integration of different vendor devices into accounting management 
systems of service providers.

2.  This would facilitate usage based accounting, which would force 
users to use sensible connection parameter values when they are 
negotiating connection setup. 

3.  Align with work in the ATM Forum Network Management subworking
group, specifically, to meet the high level requirements for 
accounting objects (within the SNMP domain).

Note: The subject of log files for accounting management has been 
discussed at the AToM MIB Working Group before. There was informal 
agreement at the AToMMIB WG session in Spring '95 to:
1.  Support MIB controlled logs
2.  Have Optional support for logs, but exact conformance when 
    supporting.

Key reasons for supporting log files for accounting management included
the following:

1.  Log files satisfy stringent accounting and billing requirements 
that most service providers have regarding non-volatile storage of 
accounting information, amount of storage, loss of information, 
frequency of polling, etc. A file transfer protocol would be more 
robust and efficient than SNMP.

2.  Log files may be easier for switch vendors to implement.

2.0  Requirements for ATM Accounting Management

Key requirements for supporting accounting management in the AToM MIB 
that have been discussed in the past include the following:

1.  Accounting management information support for ATM PVCs and SVCs.

2.  Optional support for logging PVC and SVC accounting management 
information; however, if accounting management logging is supported, 
vendors must conform to the AToM MIB specification for logging. 

3.  Logging of PVC and SVC information in seperate log files, but with 
similar control mechanisms and associated MIB control objects.

4.  Optional support for turning logging on and off per interface 
(with optional trap notification of change of logging state) via the
MIB.

5.  Support for inspecting the structure and accounting information 
item types in the log files, via the MIB, and optionally being able to

configure (via Set requests) logging of these accounting management 
information items.

6.  Optional support for log file field delimiter and line termination

character sequences in the MIB.

7.  Optional support for checkpoint (data dump) time control features; 
capability to "dump to file after connection release", or "dump to file

every x seconds from now".

8.  Flexibility in defining information items for PVC and SVC 
accounting logging, to support future enhancements.

Note: The log files could be transferred to the service provider via 
FTP or TFTP on demand, at regular time intervals, or when the maximum
log size was exceeded; this is implementation dependent, and 
specification of the mechanism of data transfer is left to the vendor.

The MIB defined in this document only specifies the basic accounting 
information and control objects for logging via MIB variables; 
additional functionality may be defined in vendor enterprise-specific 
MIB modules.

Additional requirements which are not met currently in the enclosed 
defined MIB are as follows (the intention is to define these during 
the next working session):

9. The accounting records are collected to a log file that has a
maximum defined size. A MIB object is required to support this.

10. A trap can be generated if a high water mark is exceeded in the
above log file.

INTERNET-DRAFT  MIB-Controlled ATM Accounting Management February 1996

11. MIB control object(s) is/are required to specify the low level
encoding of the accounting data items when stored in the log file.
This encoding should include:
   - ASCII
   - BER encoded type/length/value tuples.

12. A single operation by the manager should save and clear the file. 
Once cleared, the contents of all new accounting records will be as 
specified by the current contents of the Log Data Configuration object
identifer table.
When the log file is saved, the present contents of the object id 
table is saved; this saved table can be later used to intepret the
contents of the next saved accounting record file.
