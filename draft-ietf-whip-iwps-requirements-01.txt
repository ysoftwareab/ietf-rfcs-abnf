Overview

   The IETF Internet White Pages Requirements (Whip) Working Group
   proposes to establish a set of requirements for a simple Internet
   white pages service without prejudice to existing recommendations or
   implementations. This Document is designed to be used by other WGs in
   the IETF to guide the overall structure of the Internet White Pages
   Service (IWPS).


1.0 Introduction

   The Internet community has done a significant amount of work in the
   analysis of Internet White Pages Services and several documents
   address the issue of IWPS requirements [KS89, PA94].  The work on
   this document has benefited from the review of this work and several
   implementations. Each implementation was developed to explore a
   solution set of requirements.  A number of them are based on an
   underlying technology like X.500 [KH93].  Others have defined new or
   built on old systems [PD94]. With each approach we acquired a new
   understanding of the eneral problem set. The Internet always benefits
   from this type of implementation diversity and the most likely future



Genovese                                                        [Page 1]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


   for the IWPS is that it will consist of a number of directory like
   services that will interwork to provide the general IWPS.

   The purpose of this document is to define a single set of functional
   requirements for the Internet White Pages Service that accommodates
   the wide variety of information retrieval protocols that may be used
   to create a directory service, based upon the work done to date.  It
   is not the purpose of this document  to propose restrictions for the
   development of the independent implementations of the IWPS. Yet, as
   these systems are built and deployed new issues of interoperability
   and data reliability come to play.  Therefore a common set of
   information objects and procedures is proposed to minimize these
   problems.

   This Document will focus only on common information and operational
   modeling issues that all IWPS provider must conform to. To insure a
   consistent User view of this service we need to define a common
   naming structure. This will allow a User to go between different
   implementations of the service and have a consistent way of looking
   for people or other Information objects in the Internet.  For
   developers of this service we need to have an unambiguous method of
   representing the Information objects managed by the service. This
   will help facilitate interoperability and data management.

   As any group of people begin to work on an issue a set of words or
   terms start to take on meaning only to the group. This helps them to
   communicate common ideas.  Depending where you are when you join the
   effort the terms may be confusing or even new. To facilitate our need
   to communicate common ideas, Appendix C attempts to document certain
   words and terms used in this document.  It also, will expand all
   acronyms used in this document. It may be useful for the reader to
   glance through this appendix before reading this document.


2.0 Scope

   This document will describe a conceptual model for the IWPS and deal
   with naming, schema, query and response issues for a narrowly defined
   subset of directory services.  This document attempts to establish a
   simple set of information objects that should prove extensible and
   usable by developers of the IWPS.  These information objects, coupled
   with a basic set of process requirements, will form a basis from
   which related IETF efforts can build an ubiquitous IWPS. It will only
   deal with issues that are common to this service.  It will not
   attempt to be an exhaustive specification of wide scale directory
   services.

   To insure a consistent user view of the service, the User Agent (UA)



Genovese                                                        [Page 2]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


   will need to be addressed.  This will not be a specification of a UA
   but, will deal with those issues of information content as presented
   to or by the user. This Document will also describe a basic set of
   operations that will need to be supported by the UA.


3.0 Conceptual Model

   The Internet White Page Service will utilize the current information
   servers and not restrict the development of new information servers.
   It will also, strive to provide a consistent User view of the
   service.  To achieve these potentially tangential requirements it
   will be necessary to develop a model that can guide the current use
   and future development.

   At first glance it would seem that the definition of a simple,
   unified, client/server model would meet our needs. However, a simple
   model can not be achieved because, the different information servers
   that constitute the the IWPS will not, at least initially, use common
   designs or protocols.  The servers of the IWPS do not provide a
   consistent delineation of function between the client and the server
   or a common method of query and response.  One way to accommodate the
   existing, diverse client/server architectures, while creating a
   ubiquitous IWPS is to define a conceptual client/server model and the
   functions that must be performed within this model.

   This document will concentrate on how and what these servers must do
   as a minimum to participate in the IWPS with a limited set of data
   that will constitute the IWPS data model. We need to augment this
   data model with the type of operations that must be supported by the
   IWPS clients and servers.  Throughout this document we refer to the
   IWPS UA as the software that the User uses to access the IWPS. This
   UA can be seen as a client of the IWPS servers. Therefore, you can
   use the term client or UA interchangeably when discussing IWPS.

   The requirement for a consistent naming architecture for the IWPS
   presents a complex problem.  This issue is described in detail later
   in this document. To aid in the understanding of the conceptual model
   we should point out that there are two name forms used in the IWPS.
   The following conceptual names will be used:

           White Pages Name (WPN)  Maps one name to one or more
                                   IWPS entries.
           White Pages ID (WPI)    Maps one name to one and only one
                                   IWPS entry.

   The basic model for interaction between the Client and Server of the
   IWPS is depicted in Figure 1.

   Figure 1        Internet White Pages Model



   There are no restrictions on the general design or operations of IWPS
   UAs.  Any UA that is going to participate in the IWPS must be capable
   of passing required operational requests to the various information
   servers. These request must conform to the specific server
   requirements.  How the user has to present the information for the
   requests to the UA or how the UA present the results to the user is
   outside the scope of this document.  There are two basic operational
   requests defined for IWPS complaint UAs.



Genovese                                                        [Page 4]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


              1.  Search

              2.  Fetch (get, read, retrieval)

   The UA would use a WPN as the set of input parameters for the Search
   operation.  The UA would use a WPI as the input parameter for the
   Fetch operation.  Some UAs may wish to support addition modifiers to
   these operations.  On a Fetch the User may be allowed to request that
   only certain attributes be returned. This would imply that the server
   supports this modifier or the UA would have to support it.

   There are two forms of response expected from the server for each of
   the above requested operations.

              1. Positive - data or results
              2. Negative - errors or suggestions

   With the Search operation a positive response would imply that a WPI
   was returned to the UA. A positive response to a fetch operation
   would be the actual information object.  Some negative responses to a
   fetch or search operation will be:

      Fetch:
              1. Access denied.
              2. Server specific Errors - administrative limit notices.
              3. Referral to one or more servers.

      Search:
              1. Access denied.
              2. Server specific Errors - administrative limit notices.
              3. Partial match notification.
              4. Suggestions for possible WPNs to try.

   With respect to the search operation, effective server responses of
   the type 3 and 4 form above would help facilitate IWPS navigation.

   There are two basic modes of operation that describe the way the UA
   will be used to access the servers.

              1.  Connection oriented - Interactively
              2.  Connectionless - Command/Response

   Long lived connections would help serve Users that are doing
   interactive types of searches or requesting multiple Information
   objects.  Connectionless mode of use would serve single queries
   similar to those performed within the domain name system. Support of
   both modes of UA to server interactions is expected by IWPS Users.

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


4.0 Naming

   The name associated with the IWPS is complicated by opposing naming
   requirements. One requirement was to allow a user, with incomplete
   naming information to be able to navigate the IWPS until the person
   or information object is found. This name form would map one name to
   one or more information objects (i.e.  All Smiths at LLNL, US). We
   also, require a name that would uniquely identify a person or
   information object.  This name form would map one name to one and
   only one information object.

   It would be ideal if the name we used to navigate through the IWPS
   could be derived from the unique identifying name but, we can not
   meet both goals with the same name. Therefore, two naming structures
   are needed. It is recommended that the following conceptual names be
   used:

              White Pages Name (WPN)  Maps one name to one or more
                                      IWPS entries.
              White Pages ID (WPI)    Maps one name to one and only
                                      one IWPS entry.


4.1 White Pages Identifier - WPI

   The WPI is designed to directly locate a particular person or
   information object in the Internet. A WPI provides a one to one
   mapping between a name and an IWPS information object. When a User
   presents a WPI to a User Agent the service will be able, after name
   resolution, to locate the information object precisely.  It is
   recommended that the WPI be represented as a URN [SM94].  In
   particular it is important that the WPI have the following qualities:

              1.  Global uniqueness
              2.  Persistence
              3.  Independence
              4.  Human transcribability

   These and other qualities are characteristics of a URN.

   For illustration purposes it will be assumed that the WPI URN will
   have the following form:

              <URN:IANA/wp.nersc.gov:u7224>

   Where wp.nersc.gov is the DNS registered service provider that
   manages the information object u7224.  It is recommended that the DNS
   be used to specify IWPS service providers. The specification of the



Genovese                                                        [Page 6]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


   WPI attribute is in Appendix A.

   The IWPS, for any particular organization, will consist of a number
   of different information servers. These multiple servers may use
   different access protocols. The set of servers may also change over
   time.  The use of URN will help to facilitate this changing
   environment. This will be  accomplished by using the URN to URC
   mapping features [M94].  After a URN is resolved to its URC the
   attributes of the URC would be used by the IWPS UA to access a
   particular server. e.g.

              URN -> URC:
                      1.  Version, etc. info
                      2.  URL: finger://nersc.gov
                      3.  URL: whois: //nersc.gov
                      4.  URL: solo: //es.net

   This leaves administrative control of servers accessed by the IWPS
   UAs with the local manager of the URC.

   It is possible that a person or information object may be registered
   with multiple servers. This could lead to having multiple WPIs for
   each information object.  It is recommended that the information
   object have only one WPI and the multiple servers should be listed as
   URLs in the WPI's URC.  It is left to the UA implementation, with
   possible User interaction, to select which URL to resolve.

   The WPI is designed to be Human Transcribable so, Users could
   exchange them via Email or on business cards.  Because of the
   persistence nature of a WPI it could be used to get the latest
   information about a User even though the information in an Email or
   on a business card has expired.  It is more likely that WPIs will be
   used more in UA to Server or Server to Server requests.


4.2 White Pages Name - WPN

    A WPN consists of the attributes from an information object
   Template. The Ancillary Information Attribute, described later, is
   not part of the WPN.  Depending on the number of attributes
   enumerated in a IWPS query, it will provide a one to many mapping
   between a name and an IWPS information object. In general the WPN
   will be used by people with incomplete naming information to
   construct a Purported Name that can be submitted to the IWPS to
   locate an Internet person or information object. This Purported Name
   would be used as a guess when querying the IWPS. This process of
   discovery will be iterative in nature. It is envisioned that the most
   common use of a WPN would be to do searches of the IWPS space to



Genovese                                                        [Page 7]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


   locate individuals.

   To insure a consistent view of what an Internet person WPN will
   contain, the information object Template Internet White Page Person
   is specified in Appendix A. It contains the minimum required set of
   attributes for representing a person in the IWPS. Similar information
   object Templates can be defined for organizations, documents,
   services, etc. This document deals only with the Internet person WPN.

   Because the Internet person WPN consists of a number of attributes it
   is possible that you can construct a number of  Purported Names for
   the same person. e.g.

              Huitema, Inria, Fr
              Christian Huitema, Inria, Fr
              Huitema, Rodeo, Inria, Fr
              Huitema, Sophia, Inria, Fr

   The actual order the attributes of the WPN are presented by the user
   to the IWPS UA or used by the UA to generate a query is left to the
   implementation.  The User must realize that the more complete the WPN
   is the better the chance is that useful information can be returned.
   i.e. a query for just "Huitema, Fr" will most likely fail.


5.0 IWPS Schema Considerations

   The information description requirements for the IWPS consists of the
   following:

              1. Syntax for definition/representation of Information
                 Object Templates.
              2. Registration procedures for information object
                 Templates, etc.
              3. Database structure or schema.

   Items 1 and 2 will be covered in this Document. Database structure
   because, it will potentially restrict implementations (i.e. X.500
   schema based Vs DNS schema based) will not be defined in this
   document.


5.1 Syntax for definition/representation of Information objects

   A clear, precise and consistent method must be used when information
   object Templates and their attributes are discussed within the
   context of IWPS.  There are two possible methods to do this. i.e.




Genovese                                                        [Page 8]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


              1.  BNF
              2.  ASN.1


   The Working Group recommends the use of ASN.1.  It provides us with a
   set of predefined attributes and encoding syntaxs. Also, it is well
   documented and widely available.

   The use of ASN.1 to specify the structure of the information objects
   does not imply the use of Basic Encoding Rules (BER) for any IWPS
   servers protocols.   The use of Object inheritance is not used or
   specified by this document.


5.2 Registration of IWPS Information object Templates.

   The Working Group recommends the registration and publication of all
   information object Templates used for the IWPS.  We will use the IANA
   branch of the ISO OID tree for registration of the IWPS Object
   Templates.  This branch was used by the Object Templates listed in
   Appendix A.  To facilitate distribution of IWPS information object
   Templates they should be made available on the Internet information
   server (i.e. InterNIC).  At a minimum it is recommended that any new
   information object Template that will be made available via the IWPS
   will be published in a RFC and its OID registered with IANA.

   Individual organizations may define information object Templates that
   are only local in scope.  This may be needed to meet local
   organizational needs.  If these information object Templates are not
   registered with the IWPS, they may not be processable by the general
   IWPS UAs.  All information that the organization wishes to be part of
   the IWPS must use an IWPS registered information object Template.


5.3 Database Structure

   It is envisioned that the IWPS will consist of a number of
   independent information servers.  Each of these servers will
   construct their own Databases. Therefore, no Internet wide directory
   Database will be provided.  This by its nature will cause
   interoperability and synchronization problems that must be worked
   out. This area of research is under development in the IETF
   Application Area.


6.0 Security

   The IWPS must deal with two general security issues:



Genovese                                                        [Page 9]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


              1. Privacy laws/rules
              2. Access Control/Authentication

   The Global nature of the Internet creates a  complex interplay of
   Country and Organizational laws/rules.  It would best serve the IWPS
   if all information was readily available to all people in the
   Internet but, this comes up against the security/privacy needs of
   Organizations and/or people.  Security is further complicated by the
   potential diverse nature of the IWPS server environment. Each server
   could have different forms of Access/Authentication controls in place
   to meet their needs.

6.1 Privacy

   The question of User's Privacy requirements for North America has
   been addressed by NADF [NADF92].  The NADF document does not take
   into account the Global Internet set of Users.  This topic is an area
   of research in the IETF Applications Area.  It will not be dealt with
   in this document.


6.2 Access Control/Authentication

   With the IWPS environment consisting of multiple server types and
   different autonomous management domains the question of Access
   control is at best problematic. It is also clear that a model to
   approach this problem is needed if the IWPS is to be deployed.

   To meet the current needs of this community it is recommended that
   the general issues of Access Control/Authentication be broken down
   into the following two models:

              1.  Anonymous or Public Access
              2.  Administrative Access

   The issue of Administrative Access Control is a current research area
   of the IETF Application Area.  This topic deals in general with the
   issues associated with the ability to add or modify entries in the
   IWPS. This document will only address the  Anonymous or Public Access
   issues of the IWPS.

   The IWPS is to be considered a public access service only.  If an
   organization is participating in this service, they must provide at a
   minimum anonymous access to their service.  It may be the result of a
   query posted to one of these servers that a response is returned that
   the requested information is not available to the requester. This
   negative response is a minimum requirement for all IWPS servers.

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


7.0 Security Certificates

   Another feature that IWPS can provide us is the ability to store
   Security Certificates.   It is needed by secure mail services such as
   PEM and PGP.  To facilitate the storage and management of these
   Certificates a new element is defined for the iwpPerson object.  This
   new element will allow multiple Certificates to be stored with the
   person record.  It also allows for the deprecation of certificates
   through the use of a validity field.  This field is use to state the
   beginning and end dates the certificate is valid.  The element
   "certificates" is defined in Appendix A.


8.0 Data Integrity

   The question of Data Integrity was first addressed in RFC1107 [KS89].
   It basically states, that if the information is out of date it is
   useless and the service will not be used.  Therefore, a clear
   requirement is that any production IWPS provider must insure that all
   data is reasonably correct and current.

   To facilitate the User in determining the quality of the data that
   has been retrieved it is recommended that the optional Ancillary
   information attribute of the IWPperson Template be supported. This
   would require the IWPS UA to be able to retrieve and display this
   information. This may be done as a separate operation from the fetch
   of the information object. The Ancillary Information Attribute is
   defined in Appendix A. It is further recommended that any new
   information object Template include as a minimum the Ancillary
   information attribute as an optional attribute.  It would then be
   left to the IWPS servers to optionally support the storage and
   retrieval of this data.



   The Ancillary Information attribute has been designed to provide the
   following information about the information object it is part of:

              1.  The date and time of the last modification.

              2.  Who performed the last modification.

              3.  Who owns or is responsible for the data stored
                  in the information object.

              4.  What is the official source of the data.

              5.  Which attributes in the information object has

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements    16 November 1994


                  been changed.

   As new information object Templates are defined for the IWPS a new
   changeRecord type will need to be defined for it and assigned to the
   changeRecord attribute.

   This attribute is not a part of the WPN.  It is not to be used as
   part of the Purported Name presented to the IWPS UA.


9.0 Unstructured Data

   There are a number of existing directory based systems that are
   currently providing White Pages style of information. These systems
   respond to queries by returning information without regard to any
   structure of the data.  There is nothing in their protocol
   specifications that identify individual fields or attributes in the
   response that would allow it to be machine processable.

   To accommodate these systems and the way they return information, the
   element unstructureData has been added to the iwpPerson object. This
   element consists of a 1k block of data without any structure or
   content requirements. It can be used to represent/store any of the
   current sets of White Pages information.

   It should be noted that this element is added for backward
   compatibility of the existing systems only.  It should not be used
   for the development of any new white page service.



10.0 Performance

   If the IWPS is to be useful to its User community it must provide for
   reasonable performance.  To set a performance requirement is
   unnecessary.  Simply because, if the service does not meet the
   performance needs demanded by its Users it will not survive.

   The performance of the distributed IWPS will be affected by many
   things potentially outside the control of the local provider. The
   local provider can not control:

      1.  Remote server response or availability
      2.  Network speeds or partitions

Appendix A Information Object Template Definitions

   The Information Objects Template and attributes defined in this appendix are
   used to define the contents of Information Objects of the IWPS.
   In particular the the Template defined below deals with the
