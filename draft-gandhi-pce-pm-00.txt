    PCEP Extensions for Reporting MPLS-TE LSP Performance Measurements
                         draft-gandhi-pce-pm-00


Abstract

   In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,
   delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic
   engineering.  This data provides operators the characteristics of
   their networks for performance evaluation that is required to ensure
   the Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  Performance measurement
   mechanisms can be employed to measure these metrics for TE LSPs in
   real-time.  This document describes PCEP extensions for reporting
   such performance measurements to an Active Stateful PCE.

Internet-Draft      PCEP for Performance Measurement    January 22, 2016


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) as a
   communication mechanism between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a
   Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, that enables
   computation of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  [DRAFT-PCE-STATEFUL]
   specifies extensions for PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS TE
   LSPs.  It describes two mode of operations - Passive Stateful PCE and
   Active Stateful PCE.  In this document, Active Stateful PCE is
   considered.

   In certain networks, such as financial information networks, network
   performance data (e.g. packet loss, delay and delay variation
   (jitter)) is a critical measure for traffic engineering [RFC7471],
   [DRAFT-OSPF-TE-METRIC] and [DRAFT-ISIS-TE-METRIC].  This data
   provides operators the characteristics of their networks for
   performance evaluation that is required to ensure the Service Level
   Agreements (SLAs).  

   [DRAFT-PCE-SERVICE-AWARE] defines the PCEP extensions for TE LSP path
   computation using packet loss, delay and delay variation as path
   selection metrics.  However, there is a need to verify that the
   traffic sent over the TE LSP does not exceed requested metric bounds.
    [RFC6374], [RFC6375] and [DRAFT-RFC6374-UDP-RETURN-PATH] define
   protocol extensions needed for measuring packet loss, delay and delay
   variation (jitter) for bidirectional and unidirectional TE LSPs in
   real-time.

   This document provides mechanisms to report the packet loss, delay
   and delay variation (jitter) measurements of a TE LSP to an Active
   Stateful PCE.  Note that specification of the use of the reported
   packet loss, delay and delay variation measurement is outside the
   scope of this document.

   Active Stateful PCE: PCE that uses tunnel state information learned
      from PCCs to optimize path computations.  Additionally, it
      actively updates tunnel parameters in those PCCs that delegated
      control over their tunnels to the PCE.

   PCC: Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE: Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application, or
      network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
      based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   TE LSP: Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.


3.  PCEP Extensions for Reporting Delay Measurement

3.1.  DELAY-MEASUREMENT-ATTRIBUTE TLV

   The DELAY-MEASUREMENT-ATTRIBUTE TLV provides the configurable
   parameters of the delay measurement feature.  This is an optional TLV
   defined for the LSPA Object.

   For PCE-Initiated LSP ([DRAFT-PCE-INITIATED-LSP]) with delay
   measurement feature enabled, this TLV is included in the LSPA Object
   with PCInitiate message.  The DELAY-MEASUREMENT-ATTRIBUTE TLV can
   also be carried in PCUpd message in LSPA Object in order to make
   updates to delay measurement attributes such as Measurement-Interval.

   The format of the DELAY-MEASUREMENT-ATTRIBUTE TLV is shown in the
   following figure:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Value: Comprises one or more sub-TLVs.

   Following sub-TLVs are defined in this document:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------
    0   4    Reserved
    1   4    Measurement-Enable sub-TLV
    2   4    Measurement-Interval sub-TLV

   The Measurement-Enable sub-TLV MUST be added in LSPA Object when the
   delay measurement feature is enabled for the LSP.  All other sub-TLVs
   are optional and any unrecognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored. 
   If a sub-TLV of same type appears more than once, only the first
   occurrence is processed and all others MUST be ignored.  If sub-TLVs
   are not present, the default values based on the local policy are
   assumed.

   The following sub-sections describe the sub-TLVs which are currently
   defined to be carried within this TLV.

3.1.1.  Measurement-Enable sub-TLV

   The Measurement-Enable sub-TLV specifies the delay measurement mode

4.2.  LOSS-MEASUREMENT Object

   The LOSS-MEASUREMENT Object with Object-Class (Value TBA) is defined
   in this document to report the packet loss measurement of a TE LSP.

   When the LSP is enabled with the loss measurement feature, the PCC
   SHOULD include the LOSS-MEASUREMENT Object to report the measured
   packet loss to the PCE in the PCRpt message.

   The object length is 4 bytes.  Object-Types are defined as follows:

   o  Bytes-Lost: Number of Bytes sent over the LSP were lost.

4.3.  LOSS-MEASUREMENT Capability Advertisement

      To be added.



5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines new MEASUREMENT objects and
   MEASUREMENT-ATTRIBUTE TLVs for loss and delay which do not add
   additional security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440] and
   [DRAFT-PCE-STATEFUL].

   Some deployments may find the reporting of the performance
   measurement information as extra sensitive and thus should employ
   suitable PCEP security mechanisms like TCP-AO or [DRAFT-PCE-PCEPS].


6.  IANA Considerations
