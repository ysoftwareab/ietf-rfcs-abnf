1.  Introduction

   This document proposes an update to the certificate validation
   procedure specified in [RFC6487] that reduces aspects of operational
   fragility in the management of certificates in the RPKI, while
   retaining essential security features.

2.  Certificate Validation in the RPKI

   As currently defined in section 7.2 of [RFC6487], validation of PKIX
   certificates that conform to the RPKI profile relies on the use of a
   path validation process where each certificate in the validation path
   is required to meet the certificate validation criteria.

   These criteria require, in particular, that the Internet Number
   Resources (INRs) of each certificate in the validation path are
   "encompassed" by INRs on the issuing certificate.  The first
   certificate in the path is required to be a trust anchor, and its
   resources are considered valid by definition.

   For example, in the following sequence:

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   July 2016


     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
       Issuer TA,
       Subject TA,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                 2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA,
      Subject CA1,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1,
      Subject CA2,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     ROA 1:
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R1,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24

       Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

   All certificates in this scenario are considered valid since the INRs
   of each certificate are encompassed by those of the issuing
   certificate.  ROA1 is valid because the specified prefix is
   encompassed by the embedded EE certificate, as required by [RFC6482].

3.  Operational Considerations

   The allocations recorded in the RPKI change as a result of resource
   transfers.  For example, the CAs involved in transfer might choose to
   modify CA certificates in an order that causes some of these
   certificates to "over-claim" temporarily.  A certificate is said to
   "over-claim" if it includes INRs not contained in the INRs of the CA
   that issued the certificate in question.

   It may also happen that a child CA does not voluntarily request a
   shrunk resource certificate when resources are being transferred or
   reclaimed by the parent.  Furthermore operational errors that may
   occur during management of RPKI databases also may create CA
   certificates that, temporarily, no longer encompass all of the INRs
   of subordinate certificates.

   Consider the following sequence:

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   July 2016


     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA,
      Subject TA,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA,
      Subject CA1,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     Certificate 3 (invalid):
      Issuer CA1,
      Subject CA2,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

     ROA 1 (invalid):
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R1,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24

       Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

   Here Certificate 2 from the previous example was re-issued by TA to
   CA1 and the prefix 198.51.100.0/24 was removed.  However, CA1 failed
   to re-issue a new Certificate 3 to CA2.  As a result Certificate 3 is
   now over-claiming and considered invalid; by recursion the embedded
   Certificate 4 used for ROA1 is also invalid.  And ROA1 is invalid
   because the specified prefix contained in the ROA is no longer
   encompassed by a valid embedded EE certificate, as required by
   [RFC6482]

   However, it should be noted that ROA1 does not make use of any of the
   address resources that were removed from CA1's certificate, and thus
   it would be desirable if ROA1 could still be viewed as valid.
   Technically CA1 should re-issue a Certificate 3 to CA2 without
   198.51.100.0/24, and then ROA1 would be considered valid according to
   [RFC6482].  But as long as CA1 does not take this action, ROA1
   remains invalid.  It would be preferable if ROA1 could be considered
   valid, since the assertion it makes was not affected by the reduced
   scope of CA1's certificate.

4.  An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   July 2016


4.1.  Verified Resource Sets

   The problem described above can be considered as a low probability
   problem today.  However the potential impact on routing security
   would be high if an over-claiming occurred near the apex of the RPKI
   hierarchy, as this would invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree
   located below this point.

   The changes proposed here to the validation procedure in [RFC6487] do
   not change the probability of this problem, but they do limit the
   impact to just the over-claimed resources.  This revised validation
   algorithm is intended to avoid causing CA certificates to be treated
   as completely invalid as a result of over-claims.  However, these
   changes are designed to not degrade the security offered by the RPKI.
   Specifically, ROAs and router certificates will be treated as valid
   only if all of the resources contained in them are encompassed by all
   superior certificates along a path to a trust anchor.

   The way this is achieved conceptually is by maintaining Verified
   Resource Set (VRS) for each certificate that is separate from the
   INRs found in the [RFC3779] resource extension in the certificate.

4.2.  Changes to existing standards

   The following is an amended specification to be used in place of
   section 7.2 of [RFC6487].

   The following algorithm is employed to validate CA and EE resources
   certificates.  It is modeled on the path validation algorithm from
   [RFC5280], but modified to make use of the IP Address Delegation and
   AS Identifier Delegation Extensions from [RFC3779].

   There are two inputs to the validation algorithm:

   1.  a trust anchor

   2.  a certificate to be validated

   The algorithm is initialized with two new variables for use in the
   RPKI: Validated Resource Set-IP (VRS-IP) and Validated Resource Set-
   AS (VRS-AS).  These sets are used to track the set of INRs (IP
   address space and AS Numbers) that are considered valid for each CA
   certificate.  The VRS-IP and VRS-AS sets are initially set to the IP
   Address Delegation and AS Identifier Delegation values, respectively,
   from the trust anchor used to perform validation.

   This path validation algorithm verifies, among other things, that a
   prospective certification path (a sequence of n certificates)
   satisfies the following conditions:

   a.  for all 'x' in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate 'x' is
       the issuer of certificate ('x' + 1);

   b.  certificate '1' is issued by a trust anchor;

   c.  certificate 'n' is the certificate to be validated; and

   d.  for all 'x' in {1, ..., n}, certificate 'x' is valid.

   Certificate validation requires verifying that all of the following
   conditions hold, in addition to the certification path validation
   criteria specified in Section 6 of [RFC5280].

   1.  The signature of certificate x (x>1) is verified using the public
       key of the issuer's certificate (x-1), using the signature
       algorithm specified for that public key (in certificate x-1).

   2.  The current time lies within the interval defined by the
       NotBefore and NotAfter values in the Validity field of
       certificate x.

   3.  The Version, Issuer, and Subject fields of certificate x satisfy
       the constraints established in Section 4.1-4.7 of this
       specification.

   4.  Certificate x contains all the extensions that MUST be present,
       as defined in Section 4.8 of this specification.  The value(s)
       for each of these extensions MUST be satisfy the constraints
       established for each extension in the respective sections.  Any
       extension not identified in Section 4.8 MUST NOT appear in
       certificate x.

   5.  Certificate x MUST NOT have been revoked, i.e., it MUST NOT
       appear on a CRL issued by the CA represented by certificate x-1

   6.  If certificate x is an EE certificate, then the INRs of this
       certificate MUST be "encompassed" by the values of VRS-IP and
       VRS-AS for certificate x-1.

   7.  If certificate x is a CA certificate, compute the VRS-IP and VRS-
       AS set values as indicated below:

       *  If the IP Address Delegation extension is present in
          certificate x, compute the intersection of the resources

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   July 2016


          between this extension and the value of the VRS-IP computed
          for certificate x-1.

       *  If the IP Address Delegation extension is absent in
          certificate x, set the VRS-IP to NULL.

       *  If the AS Identifier Delegation extension is present in
          certificate x, compute the intersection of the resources
          between this extension and the value of the VRS-AS computed
          for certificate x-1

       *  If the AS Identifier Delegation extension is absent in
          certificate x, set the VRS-AS to NULL.

       *  If x = n (i.e., this is the certificate being validated),
          then:

          1.  If IP Address Delegation extension is present, it is
              replaced with the intersection of the values from that
              extension and the current value of the VRS-IP.

          2.  If an AS Identifier Delegation extension is present, it is
              replaced with the intersection of the values from that
              extension and the current value of the VRS-IP.

       *  If an RP is caching the results of validation, these values
          MAY be stored along with the certificate, to facilitate
          incremental validation based on cached results.

   These rules allow a CA certificate to contain resources that are not
   present in (all of) the certificates along the path from the trust
   anchor to the CA certificate.  If none of the resources in the CA
   certificate are present in all certificates along the path, no
   subordinate certificates could be valid.  However, the certificate is
   not immediately rejected as this may be a transient condition.  Not
   immediately rejecting the certificate does not result in a security
   problem because the associated VRS sets accurately reflect the
   resources validly associated with the certificate in question.

   The INRs of an EE certificate being validated MUST always be
   encompassed by all certificates along the path to the trust anchor
   used to verify that certificate.  The algorithm described above
   ensures this.

   Note that ROAs [RFC6482] and BGPSec router (EE) certificates
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] can contain multiple prefixes or
   ASNs respectively, and an over-claim of any of these would result in
   the ROA or BGPSec EE certificates being considered invalid.  However,

   operators MAY issue separate ROAs or BGPSec router certificates to
   avoid this type of fate sharing.

4.3.  An example

   Consider the following example under the amended approach:

     Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
      Issuer TA,
      Subject TA,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

       Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                              2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500
       Warnings: none

     Certificate 2:
      Issuer TA,
      Subject CA1,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32, AS64496

       Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24,
                              2001:db8::/32, AS64496
       Warnings: none

     Certificate 3:
      Issuer CA1,
      Subject CA2,
      Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, AS64496

       Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496
       Warnings: over-claim for 198.51.100.0/24

     ROA 1 (valid):
      Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R1,
       Resources 192.0.2.0/24

        Verified resources: 192.0.2.0/24
        Warnings: none

        Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

       ROA1 is considered valid because the prefix matches the Verified
       Resource Set on the embedded EE certificate, as required by
       RFC 6482.

Internet-Draft               RPKI Validation                   July 2016


     ROA 2 (invalid):
      Embedded Certificate 5 (EE certificate invalid):
       Issuer CA2,
       Subject R2,
       Resources 198.51.100.0/24

        EE certificate is invalid due to over-claim for 198.51.100.0/24

        Prefix 198.51.100.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496

       ROA2 is considered invalid because he embedded EE certificate is
       considered invalid.

     BGPSec Certificate 1 (valid):
      Issuer CA2
      Subject ROUTER-64496
      Resources AS64496

       Verified resources: AS64496
       Warnings: none

     BGPSec Certificate 2 (invalid):
      Issuer CA2
      Subject ALL-ROUTERS
      Resources AS64496-AS64497

       EE certificate is invalid due to over-claim for AS64497

       This problem can be mitigated by issuing separate certificates
       for each AS number.

5.  Security Considerations

   The authors believe that the revised validation algorithm introduces
   no new security vulnerabilities into the RPKI.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No updates to the registries are suggested by this document.
