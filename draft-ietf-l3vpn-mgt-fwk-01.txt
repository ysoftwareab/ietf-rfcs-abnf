  1. Introduction 
    
  1.1 Changes since last version 
    
     . Add new section 1.2 on terminology. 
     . Rewording of major parts of the document. 
    
  1.2 Terminology 
    
   In this document, the following terms are used and defined as 
   follows: 
    
   VPN: 
      Virtual Private Network. A set of transmission and switching 
      resources, which will be used over a public infrastructure to 
      process  the  (IP)  traffic  that  characterizes  communication 
      services between the sites or premises interconnected via this 
      VPN. Such VPN networks MUST provide user identification and 
      authorization capabilities so that their access can be granted 
      accordingly, and they SHOULD also provide some guarantees as far 
      as the preservation of the VPN traffic's confidentiality is 
      concerned.  
    
   VPN Instance: 
      From a management standpoint, a VPN instance is the collection of 
      management data that strictly refer to a given VPN that has been 
      deployed and managed by a VPN service provider. 
    
   VPN Site: 
      A VPN customer's location that can access at least one VPN. 
    
   VPN Service Provider (SP): 
      A Service Provider that offers VPN-related services. 
    
   VPN Customer: 
      Refers to a customer that bought VPNs from a VPN service provider. 
    
   PPVPN: 
      Provider  Provisioned  VPN.  Denotes  VPNs  for  which  a  service 
      provider participates in provisioning and management. 
    
   L3VPN: 
      PPVPN for providing layer-3 (routed) services. See [L3VPN-FRWK]. 
    
   Customer Agent: 
      Denotes the entity that is responsible for requesting VPN customer 
      specific information.

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


   SLA: 
      Service Level Agreement.  
    
   SLS: 
      Service Level Specifications. 
    
    
  1.3 Management Functions 
    
   For any type of Layer-3 PPVPN (PE or CE-based VPNs) it is recommended 
   to have a management platform where the VPN-related information could 
   be collected and managed. The Service and Network Management System 
   may centralize information related to instances of a VPN and allow 
   users to configure and provisions each instance from a central 
   location.  
    
   A SP must be able to manage the capabilities and characteristics of 
   their VPN services. Customers should have means to ensure fulfillment 
   of the VPN service they subscribed to. To the extent possible, 
   automated operations and interoperability with standard management 
   protocols should be supported. 
    
   Two main management functions are identified: 
    
     . A customer service management function: 
    
   Provides the means for a customer to query or configure customer 
   specific information, or receive alarms regarding his or her VPN. 
   Customer specific information includes data related to contact, 
   billing,  site,  access  network,  IP  address,  routing  protocol 
   parameters, etc. It may also include confidential data, such as 
   encryption keys. Several solutions could be used: (1) proprietary 
   network management system (2) SNMP manager (3) PDP function (4) 
   directory service, etc. The customer should have a means to order 
   VPN-based  services  (we  will  refer  to  this  function  as  "VPN 
   Ordering"). 
      
     . A provider network management function: 
    
   This function is responsible for configuring and provisioning the 
   network  resources  in  order  to  meet  the  offered  VPN  services 
   requirements. This mainly consists of (1) managing, (2) provisioning 
   and (3) configuring the physical links, the offered VPNS, the 
   subscribed  customers  and  the  VPN  services  offering.  Additional 
   features to be supported includes add a VPN, add a customer, delete a 
   VPN, modifying VPN-related parameters. In addition, the VPN-SLS 
   assurance should be deployed in order to verify the fulfillment of 
   the subscribed VPN agreements.

  1.4 Reference Models 
    
   The ITU-T Telecommunications Management Network has the following 
   generic requirements structure: 
    
     . Engineer,  deploy  and  manage  the  switching,  routing  and 
        transmission resources supporting the service, from a network 
        perspective (network element management); 
    
     . Manage  the  VPNs  deployed  over  these  resources  (network 
        management); 
    
     . Manage the VPN service (service management);

            Figure 2: Reference Model for CE-based L3VPNs Management. 
    
   Figure 1 and 2 (see above) presents the reference models for both PE 
   and  CE-based  L3VPN  management,  according  to  the  aforementioned 
   generic structure. 
    
   In both models, the service manager administrates customer specific 
   attributes, such as customer Identifier (ID), personal information 
   (e.g., name, address, phone number, credit card number, etc.), 
   subscription  services  and  parameters,  access  control  policy 
   information, billing and statistical information, etc. 
    
   In  the  PE-based  reference  model,  the  provider  network  manager 
   administrates device attributes and their relationship, covering PE 
   devices and other devices constructing the corresponding PE-based 
   VPN. 
    
   In  the  CE-based  reference  model,  the  provider  network  manager 
   administrates device attributes and their relationship, covering PE 
   *and* CE devices constructing the corresponding CE-based VPN. 
    
   Network and customer management systems that are responsible for 
   managing VPN networks, have several challenges depending on the type 
   of VPN network(s) they are required to manage.

  2. PPVPN Service Operations and Management 
    
   The service management groups all functions that aim at managing the 
   service-based operations like service ordering, service subscription, 
   activation, etc. 
    
   The  Customer  Management  function  controls  the  PPVPN  service 
   management at the Service Management Layer (SML). It mainly consists 
   of defining the PPVPN services offered by the SP, collecting and 
   consolidating the customer PPVPN services requirements, as well as 
   performing  some  reporting  for  the  customer.  This  function  is 
   correlated with the Network Management function at the Network 
   Management  Layer  (NML)  for  initiating  the  PPVPN  services 
   provisioning, and getting some service reporting.

               Figure 3: Overview of the Service Management 
    
   A customer must have a means to view the topology, operational state, 
   order status, and other parameters associated with the VPN service 
   offering that has been subscribed. 
    
   All aspects of management information about CE devices and customer 
   attributes of a PPVPN manageable by a SP should be capable of being 
   configured and maintained by an authenticated, authorized Service 
   manager. 
    
   A customer agent should be able to make dynamic requests for changing 
   parameters describing a service. A customer should be able to receive 
   response from the SP network in response to these requests (modulo 
   the existence of necessary agreements). Communication between 
   customer Agents and (VPN) service providers will rely upon a 
   query/response mechanism.

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


   A customer who may not be able to afford the resources to manage its 
   CPE premises should be able to outsource the management of the VPN to 
   the service provider(s) supporting the network. 
    
    
  2.2 PPVPN Service Offering Management 
    
   The deployment of a VPN hopefully addresses customers' requirements. 
   Thus, the provider must have the means to advertise the VPN-based 
   services it offers. Then, the potential customers could select the 
   service they want to subscribe to. Additional features could be 
   associated to this subscription phase, like the selection of a level 
   of quality associated to the delivery of the VPN service, the level 
   of management of the VPN service performed by the SP, security 
   options, etc. 
    
    
  2.3 PPVPN Service Order Management 
    
   This operation aims at managing the requests initiated by the 
   customers and tracks the status of the achievement of the related 
   operations. The activation of the orders is conditioned by the 
   availability of the resources that meet the customer's requirements 
   with the agreed guaranties (note that could be a result of a 
   negotiation phase between the customer and the provider). 
    
    
  2.4 PPVPN Service Assurance 
    
   The customer must have the means to evaluate the fulfillment of the 
   contracted SLA with the provider. Thus, the provider must monitor, 
   measure and provide some statistical information to the customer 
   assuming  an  agreement  between  both  parties  on  the  measurement 
   methodology as well as the specification of the corresponding (set 
   of) quality of service indicators. 
    
    
  2.5 Customer Service Management Information Model 
    
   This section presents the information model that is used for PPVPN 
   service management at the SML. The information models represent the 
   data that need to be managed, and the way they are represented. At 
   the SML, the information model that is foreseen is composed of 
   Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Service Level Specifications 
   (SLS).

     2.5.1 SLA/SLS Content 
    
   Services are described through Service Level Agreements (SLA) that 
   are contractual documents between customers and service providers. 
   The technical part of the service description is called the Service 
   Level  Specification  (SLS).  The  SLS  groups  different  kinds  of 
   parameters. Some are more related with the description of the 
   transport of the packets, and some with the specification of the 
   service itself. 
    
   A Service Level Specification (SLS) may be defined per access network 
   connection, per VPN, per VPN site, and/or per VPN route. The service 
   provider may define objectives and the measurement intervals for at 
   least the SLS using the following Service Level Objective (SLO) 
   parameters:  
    
     . QoS and traffic parameters 
     . Availability for the site, VPN, or access connection 
     . Duration of outage intervals per site, route or VPN 
     . Service activation interval (e.g., time to turn up a new site)  
     . Trouble report response time interval  
     . Time to repair interval  
     . Total incoming/outgoing traffic from a site, a (VPN) route or 
        that has transited through the whole VPN  
     . Measurement of non-conforming incoming/outgoing traffic 
        (compliance of traffic should deserve some elaboration, because 
        of many perspectives - security, QoS, routing, etc.) from a 
        site, a (VPN) route, or which has transited through the whole 
        VPN  
    
   The service provider and the customer may negotiate contractual 
   penalties in the case(s) where the provider does not meet a (set of) 
   SLS performance objective(s). 
    
   Traffic parameters and actions should be defined for incoming and 
   outgoing packets that go through the demarcation between the service 
   provider premises and the customer's premises. For example, traffic 
   policing functions may be activated at the ingress of the service 
   provider's network, while traffic shaping capabilities could be 
   activated at the egress of the service provider's network. 
    
    
  2.6 Customer Management Functions 
    
   This section presents detailed customer management functions in the 
   traditional  fault,  configuration,  accounting,  performance,  and 
   security (FCAPS) management categories.

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


    

     2.6.1 Fault Management 
    
   Basically the fault management function of the Customer Service 
   Manager  relies  upon  the  manipulation  of  network  layer  failure 
   information, and it reports incidents to the impacted customers. Such 
   reports should be based upon and relate to the VPN service offering 
   subscribed by the customer. The Customer Management function support 
   for fault management includes:  
    
     . Indication of customer's services impacted by failure, 
     . Incident recording or logs. 
    
    

     2.6.2 Configuration Management 
    
   The configuration management function of the Customer Manager must be 
   able to configure PPVPN service parameters with the level of detail 
   that the customer is able to specify, according to service templates 
   defined by the provider. 
    
   A service template contains fields which, when instantiated, yield a 
   definite service requirement or policy. For example, a template for 
   an IPSec tunnel [IPSEC] would contain fields such as tunnel end 
   points,   authentication   modes,   encryption   and   authentication 
   algorithms, shared keys (if any), and traffic filters.  
    
   A BGP/MPLS-based VPN service template would contain fields such as 
   the customer premises that need to be interconnected via the VPN.  
   A QoS agreement template would contain fields such as one-way transit 
   delay, inter-packet delay variation, throughput, and packet loss 
   thresholds. 
    
    

     2.6.3 Accounting 
    
   Basically, the accounting management function of the Customer Manager 
   is provided with network layer measurements information and manages 
   this information. The Customer Manager is responsible for the 
   following accounting functions:  
    
     . Retrieval of accounting information from the Provider Network 
        Manager, 
     . Analysis, storage and administration of measurements.  


  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 11] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


    
   Some providers may require near-real time reporting of measurement 
   information, and may offer this as part of a customer network 
   management service.  
    
   If a SP supports "Dynamic Bandwidth Management" service, then the 
   schedule and the amount of the bandwidth required to perform 
   requested bandwidth allocation change(s) must be traceable for 
   monitoring and accounting purposes.  
    
   Solutions should state compliance with accounting requirements, as 
   described in section 1.7 of [RFC2975]. 
    
    

     2.6.4 Performance Management 
    
   >From the Customer Manager's perspective, performance management 
   includes functions involved in the determination of the conformance 
   level  with  the  Service  Level  Specifications,  such  as  QoS  and 
   availability measurements. The objective is to correlate accounting 
   information with performance and fault management information to 
   produce billing that takes into account SLA provisions for periods of 
   time where the service level objectives are not met. 
    
   The  performance  information  should  reflect  the  quality  of  the 
   subscribed VPN service as perceived by the customer. This information 
   could be measured by the provider or controlled by a third party. The 
   parameters that will be used to reflect the performance level could 
   be negotiated and agreed between the service provider and the 
   customer during the VPN service negotiation phase. 
    
   Performance management should also support analysis of important 
   aspects of a PPVPN, such as bandwidth utilization, response time, 
   availability, QoS statistics, and trends based on collected data.  
    
    

     2.6.5 Security Management  
    
   From the Customer Manager's perspective, the security management 
   function includes management features to guarantee the security of 
   devices, configuration data and access connections. 
    
    





  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 12] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


      2.6.5.1   Management Access Control 
    
   Management access control determines the privileges that a user has 
   for particular applications and parts of the network. Without such 
   control, only the security of the data and control traffic is 
   protected,  leaving  the  devices  providing  the  PPVPN  network 
   unprotected, among other equipment or resources. Access control 
   capabilities protect these devices to ensure that users have access 
   to the sole resources and applications they are granted to use. 
    
    

      2.6.5.2   Authentication 
    
   Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a VPN 
   user.  The  Service  Manager  must  support  standard  methods  for 
   authenticating users attempting to access VPN services. 
    
   Scalability is critical as the number of nomadic/mobile clients is 
   increasing rapidly. The authentication scheme implemented for such 
   deployments must be manageable for large numbers of users and VPN 
   access points.  
    
   Support for strong authentication schemes shall be supported to 
   ensure the security of both VPN access point-to-VPN access point (PE 
   to PE) and client-to-VPN Access point (CE-to-PE) communications. This 
   is particularly important to prevent VPN access point (VPN AP) 
   spoofing. VPN Access Point Spoofing is the situation where an 
   attacker tries to convince a PE or a CE that the attacker is the VPN 
   Access Point. If an attacker succeeds, then the device will send VPN 
   traffic to the attacker (who could forward it on to the actual (and 
   granted)  access  point  after  compromising  confidentiality  and/or 
   integrity).  
    
   In other words, a non-authenticated VPN AP can be spoofed with a man-
   in-the-middle attack, because the endpoints rarely verify each other. 
   A weakly authenticated VPN AP may be subject to such an attack. 
   However, strongly authenticated VPN APs are not subject to such 
   attacks, because the man-in-the-middle cannot authenticate as the 
   real AP, due to the strong authentication algorithms. 
    
    
  2.7 Customer Management Architecture 
    
   This section proposes a high level architecture for the PPVPN 
   management framework as far as the SML layer is concerned. The goal 
   is to map the customer management functions described in section 2.3 



  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 13]

   to  architectural  yet  functional  blocks,  and  to  describe  the 
   communication with the other PPVPN management functions. 


     2.7.1 Functional Architecture 
    
   Two main functional blocks can be recognized: 
    
     . A PPVPN Service Manager, for defining the PPVPN services and 
        initiating the corresponding provisioning. This block takes the 
        Customer Agent requirements as inputs, and the Provider Network 
        Management provisioning system as the output. 
    
     . A  PPVPN  Service  Assurance  Manager,  for  managing  services 
        failures, and performing customer reporting. This block takes 
        the Provider Network Management assurance system as an input, 
        and the Customer Agent as the output.

  3. L3VPN Provider Network Manager 
    
  3.1 Provider Network Management Definition 
    
    
   When implementing a VPN architecture within a domain (or a set of 
   domains managed by a single ISP), an ISP must have a means to view 
   the physical and logical topology of the VPN premises, the VPN 
   operational status, the VPN service ordering status, the VPN service 
   handling, the VPN service activation status, and other aspects 
   associated with each customer's VPN in terms of set of relevant 
   parameters and attributes.  



  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 14] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


    
   The management of a VPN service from a provider's perspective 
   consists mainly in: 
     . Managing the customers (the term "customer" denotes a role 
        rather than the end user, thus a SP could be a customer) and 
        end-users in terms of SLA 
     . Managing the VPN premises (especially creating, modifying and 
        deleting operations, editing the related information to a 
        specific link or supervising the AAA [RFC2903][RFC2906] 
        operations)  
     . Managing the CE-PE links (particularly creating, modifying and 
        deleting links, editing the related information to a specific 
        VPN) 
     . Managing the service ordering like Quality of Service in terms 
        of supported classes of service, traffic isolation, etc. 
    
   Currently, proprietary methods are often used to manage VPNs. The 
   additional expense associated with operators having to use multiple 
   proprietary configuration-related management methods (e.g., Command 
   Line Interface (CLI) languages) to access such systems is not 
   recommended, because it affects the overall cost of the service 
   (including the exploitation costs), especially when multiple vendor 
   technologies (hence multiple expertise) are used to support the VPN 
   service offering. Therefore, devices should provide standards-based 
   interfaces  wherever  feasible.  From  this  perspective,  additional 
   requirements on possible interoperability issues and availability of 
   such standardized management interfaces need to be investigated. 
    
    
  3.2 Network Management Functions 
    
   In addition, there can be internal service provided by the SP for 
   satisfying the customer service requirements. Some of these may 
   include the notion of dynamic deployment of resources for supporting 
   the customer visible services, high availability service for the 
   customer  may  be  supported  by  automatic  failure  detection  and 
   automatic switchover to back-up VPNs. These are accomplished with 
   inter-working  with  the  FCAPS  capabilities  of  Provider  Network 
   Manager. 
    
    

     3.2.1 Fault Management 
    
   The Provider Network Manager support for fault management includes:  
    
     . Fault detection (incidents reports, alarms, failure 
        visualization),  


  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 15] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


     . Fault localization (analysis of alarms reports, diagnostics), 
     . Corrective actions (data path, routing, resource allocation).  
    
   Since L3VPNs rely upon a common network infrastructure, the Provider 
   Network Manager provides a means to inform the Service Manager about 
   the VPN customers impacted by a failure in the infrastructure. The 
   Provider Network Manager should provide pointers to the related 
   customer configuration information to contribute to the procedures of 
   fault isolation and the determination of corrective actions.  
    
   It is desirable to detect faults caused by configuration errors, 
   because these may cause VPN service to fail, or not meet other 
   requirements (e.g., traffic and routing isolation). One approach 
   could be a protocol that systematically checks all constraints have 
   been taken into account, and consistency checks have been enforced 
   during the tunnel configuration process.  
    
   A capability that aims at checking IP reachability within a VPN must 
   be provided for diagnostic purposes. 
    
   A capability that aims at checking the configuration of a VPN device 
   must be provided for diagnostic purposes. 
    
    

     3.2.2 Configuration Management 
    
   The Provider Network Manager must support configuration management 
   capabilities to deploy VPNs. To do so, a Provider Network Manager 
   must provide configuration management to provision at least the 
   following L3VPN components: PE, CE, hierarchical tunnels, access 
   connections, routing, and QoS, as detailed in this section. If access 
   to the Internet is provided, then this option must also be 
   configurable. 
    
   Provisioning for adding or removing VPN customer premises should be 
   as automated as possible.  
    
   Finally, the Provider Network Manager must ensure that these devices 
   and protocols are provisioned consistently and correctly. The 
   solution should provide a means for checking if a service order is 
   correctly provisioned. This would represent one method of diagnosing 
   configuration errors. Configuration errors can arise due to a variety 
   of reasons: manual configuration, intruder attacks, and conflicting 
   service requirements.  
    
   Requirements for L3VPN configuration management are: 
    


  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 16] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


     . The Provider Network Manager must support configuration of VPN 
        membership 
    
     . The Provider Network Manager should use identifiers for SPs, 
        L3VPNs, PEs, CEs, hierarchical tunnels and access connections as 
        described in [L3VPN-FRWK]. 
    
     . Tunnels must be configured between PE/CE devices. This requires 
        coordination of tunnel identifiers, hierarchical tunnels, VPNs, 
        and any associated service information, for example, a QoS 
        service. 
    
     . Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must 
        be configured. For multicast services, multicast routing 
        protocols must also be configurable. 
    
     . Routing protocols running between PE routers, and between PE and 
        P routers must also be configured. 
    
   PE-based only: 
    
     . Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must 
        be configured on a per VPN basis. The Provider Network Manager 
        must support configuration of CE routing protocol for each 
        access connection. 
    
     . The configuration of a PE-based L3VPN must be coordinated with 
        the configuration of the underlying infrastructure, including 
        Layer 1 and 2 networks interconnecting components of a L3VPN. 
    
    

      3.2.2.1   Provisioning Routing-based Configuration Information 
    
   The Provider Network Manager must provision parameters for the IGP 
   for a L3VPN. This includes metrics, capacity, QoS capability, and 
   restoration parameters.  
    
    

      3.2.2.2   Provisioning Network Access-based Configuration Information 
    
   The Provider Network Manager must provision network access between 
   SP-managed PE and CE equipments. 
    
    




  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 17] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


      3.2.2.3   Provisioning Security Services-based Configuration Information 
    
   When a security service is requested, the Provider Network Manager 
   must provision the entities and associated parameters involved in the 
   provisioning of the service. For example, for IPSec services, 
   tunnels, options, keys, and other parameters must be provisioned at 
   either the CE and/or the PE routers. In the case of an intrusion 
   detection service, the filtering and detection rules must be 
   provisioned on a VPN basis.  
    
    

      3.2.2.4   Provisioning VPN Resource Parameters  
    
   A service provider must have a means to dynamically provision 
   resources associated with VPN services. For example, in a PE-based 
   service, the number and size of virtual switching and forwarding 
   table instances must be provisioned. 
    
   Dynamic VPN resource allocation is crucial to cope with the frequent 
   requests for changes that are expressed by customers (e.g., sites 
   joining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The PE 
   routers should be able to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This 
   capability is especially important for dial-up and wireless VPN 
   services.  
    
   If a SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth Management" service, then the 
   dates, times, amounts and intervals required to perform requested 
   bandwidth allocation change(s) must be traceable for accounting 
   purposes.  
    
   If a SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth Management" service, then the 
   provisioning system must be able to make requested changes within the 
   ranges and bounds specified in the Service Level Specifications. 
   Examples of QoS parameters are the response time and the probability 
   of being able to service such a request. 
    
    

      3.2.2.5   Provisioning Value-Added Service Access 
    
   A L3VPN service provides controlled access between a set of sites 
   over a common backbone. However, many service providers also offer a 
   range of value-added services, for example: Internet access, firewall 
   services, intrusion detection, IP telephony and IP Centrex, 
   application hosting, backup, etc. It is outside of the scope of this 
   document to define if and how these different services interact with 


  El Mghazli and al.     Expires - July 2004                [Page 18] 

  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-mgt-fwk-01.txt       January 2004 


   the VPN service offering. However, the VPN service must be able to 
   provide access to these various types of value-added services.  
    
   A VPN service should allow the SP to supply the customer with 
   different kinds of well-known IP services (e.g. DNS, NTP, RADIUS, 
   etc.) needed for ordinary network operation and management. The 
   provider should be able to provide IP services to multiple customers 
   from one or many servers.  
    
   A firewall function may be required to restrict access to the L3VPN 
   from the Internet [Y.1311]. 
    
   A managed firewall service must be carrier-class. For redundancy and 
   failure recovery purposes, a means for firewall fail-over should be 
   provided. Managed firewall services that may be provided include 
   dropping specified protocol types, intrusion protection, traffic-rate 
   limiting against malicious attacks, etc. 
    
   Managed firewalls must be supported on a per-VPN basis, although 
   multiple VPNs will be supported by the same physical device. Managed 
   firewalls should be provided at the access point(s) of the L3VPN. 
   Such services may be embedded in the CE or PE devices, or implemented 
   in standalone devices.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager should allow a customer to outsource the 
   management of an IP service to the SP providing the VPN or a third 
   party.  
    
   The management system should support collection of information 
   necessary for optimal allocation of IP services in response to 
   customers' orders, in correlation with provider-provisioned resources 
   supporting the service. 
    
   Reachability to and from the Internet from/to sites within a VPN must 
   be configurable by an SP. Configuring routing policy to control 
   distribution of VPN routes advertised to the Internet could realize 
   this.  
    
    

      3.2.2.6   Provisioning Hybrid VPN Services 
    
   Configuration of inter-working L3VPN solutions should also be 
   supported. Ensuring that security and end-to-end QoS issues are 
   addressed.

     3.2.3 Accounting 
    
   The Provider Network Manager is responsible for the measurements of 
   resource utilization. 
    
    

     3.2.4 Performance Management 
    
   From the Provider Network Manager's perspective, performance 
   management includes functions involved in monitoring and collecting 
   performance data regarding devices, facilities, and services.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager must monitor the devices' behavior to 
   evaluate performance metrics associated with a SLS. Different 
   measurement techniques may be necessary depending on the service for 
   which an SLA is provided. Example services are QoS, security, 
   multicast, and temporary access. These techniques may be either 
   intrusive or non-intrusive, depending on the parameters being 
   monitored.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager must also monitor aspects of the VPN not 
   directly associated with a SLS, such as resource utilization, status 
   of devices and transmission facilities, as well as control of 
   monitoring resources such as probes and remote agents at network 
   access points used by customers and mobile users. 
    
   Devices supporting L3VPN whose level of quality is defined by SLSs 
   should have real-time performance measurements that have indicators 
   and threshold crossing alerts. Such thresholds should be 
   configurable. 
    
    

     3.2.5 Security Management  
    
   From the Provider Network Manager's perspective, the security 
   management function of the Provider Network Manager must include 
   management features to guarantee the preservation of the 
   confidentiality of customers' traffic and control data as described 
   in section 5.9 of [L3VPN-REQ].

   Each L3VPN solution must specify the information bases (MIBs, PIBs, 
   XML schemas, etc.) for network elements involved in L3VPN services. 
   This is an essential requirement in network provisioning. The 
   approach should identify any L3VPN specific information not contained 
   in a standard MIB.  
    
    

     4.1.1 Standard MIBs/PIBs 

      4.1.1.1   Customer visible routing 
    
   According to section 3.3 of [L3VPN-FRWK], the following technologies 
   are available for the exchange of routing information at the customer 
   interface level. The corresponding MIBs can be used for managing 
   routing policies across the customer interface. 
    
     . Static routing 
     . RIP (Routing Information Protocol) 
     . OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) 
     . BGP-4 (Border Gateway Protocol version 4) 
    
    

      4.1.1.2   Routing across the SP backbone 
    
   According to section 4.4 of [L3VPN-FRWK], the following technologies 
   are available for routing within the SP network: 
    
     . Per-VPN routing model 
          o Static routing 
          o RIP 
          o OSPF 
          o IS-IS 
          o BGP-4 
    
     . Aggregated routing model

          o MP-iBGP [MP-BGP4] 
          o OSPF 
          o IS-IS  
    
    

      4.1.1.3   VPN tunneling 
    
   According to section 4.4 of [L3VPN-FRWK], the following technologies 
   are available for VPN tunneling within the SP network: 
    
     . MPLS 
     . GRE 
     . IPSec ([IPSEC-MIB], [IPSEC-PIB]) 
     . IP-in-IP 
    
    

      4.1.1.4   Quality of Service 
    
   According to section 4.5 of [L3VPN-FRWK], the following technologies 
   are available for QoS support within the SP network: 
    
     . Diffserv ([RFC3289], [RFC3317]) 
     . RSVP signaling 
    
    

     4.1.2 L3VPN specific MIBs/PIBs 

      4.1.2.1   PE-based L3VPN 
    
     . Layer 3 VPNs 
          o BGP/MPLS VPNs ([MIB-2547], [PIB-2547]) 
          o Virtual Routers ([VR-MIB]) 
          o TBD 
    
     . Layer 2 VPNs:  
          o TBD 
    
    
      4.1.2.2   CE-based L3VPN 
    
     . TBD

  4.2 Communication 
    
   The deployment of a VPN may span a wide range of network equipment, 
   potentially including equipment from multiple vendors. Therefore, the 
   provisioning of a unified network management view of the VPN shall be 
   simplified by means of standard management interfaces and models. 
   This will also facilitate customer self-managed (monitored) network 
   devices or systems. 
    
   In case where significant configuration is required whenever a new 
   service is to be provisioned, it is important for scalability reasons 
   that the NMS provides a largely automated mechanism for the relevant 
   configuration operations.  
   Manual configuration of VPN services (i.e., new sites, or re-
   provisioning existing ones), could lead to scalability issues, and 
   should be avoided. It is thus important for network operators to 
   maintain visibility of the complete picture of the VPN through the 
   NMS system. This should be achieved by using standard protocols such 
   as SNMP, COPS, NetConf. Use of proprietary command-line interfaces is 
   not recommended. 
    
    
  5. Configuration aspects of PPVPN solutions 

  5.1 Layer 2 VPNs 

     5.1.1 VPWS 

     5.1.15.1.2 VPLS 

  5.2 Layer 3 VPNs 

     5.2.1 PE-based 2547bis 

     5.2.15.2.2 PE-based Virtual Router
