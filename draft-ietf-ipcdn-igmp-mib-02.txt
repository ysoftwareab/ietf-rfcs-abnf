1.        The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
    o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [3]. 
    
    o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of         
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in         
       RFC 1155 [4], RFC 1212 [5] and RFC 1215 [6]. The second version,         
       called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [7], RFC 2579 [8] and RFC         
       2580 [9]. 
    
    o Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and         
       described in RFC 1157 [10]. A second version of the SNMP message         
       protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is         
       called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [11] and RFC 1906 [12].         
       The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and         
       described in RFC 2574 [14], RFC 2272 [18] and RFC 2274 [19]. 
    
    o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The         
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is         
       described in RFC 1157 [10]. A second set of protocol operations         
       and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [15]. 
    
    o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [16] and 
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575         
       [17]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo describes the application of a MIB module that is 
   compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be 
   produced through the appropriate translations. The resulting 
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects 
   or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of 
   Counter64). Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be 
   converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation 
   process. However, this loss of machine readable information is not 
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

2.        Glossary 
    
   The following non-ietf terms are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over 
   Cable Service Interface Specification process. 
    
   CATV - Originally 'Community Antenna Television', refers to cable or 
   HFC (see below) system used to deliver video signals to a community. 
    
   CM, Cable Modem - A CM acts as a 'slave' station in a DOCSIS 
   compliant cable data system. 
    
   CMTS, Cable Modem Termination System - A generic term covering a 
   cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.  A CMTS acts as the 
   master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.  It is the 
   only station that transmits downstream, and it controls the 
   scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated CMs. 
    
   CMCI - or Subscriber side, refers to the Cable Modem Customer 
   Interface that connects to CPE on the CM. 
    
   CPE - Customer Premise Equipment, non-Cable Modem IP Hosts attached 
   to the Cable Modem. 
    
   DOCSIS - 'Data Over Cable Interface Specification'.  A term 
   referring to the ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem 
   systems, [23] 
    
   Downstream - From the head-end towards the subscriber. 
    
   Head-end - The origination point in most cable systems of the 
   subscriber video signals. Generally this is also the location of the 
   CMTS equipment. 
    
   HFC - Hybrid-Fiber-Coax, refers to physical wire(s) connecting the 
   CMTS and CM. 
    
   MAC Packet - A DOCSIS PDU. 
    
   NSI - Network-Side-Interface, refers to interface(s) on the CMTS 
   that are typically connected to the Internet. 
    
   RF - Radio Frequency. 
    
   Upstream - From the subscriber towards the head-end.

3.        Overview 
    
   The DOCSIS Multicast CM and CMTS interconnect specification can be 
   modeled (or described) by 'splitting' the traditional Internet Group 
   Management Protocol (IGMP), [22], interfaces into Host and Querier 
   side interfaces. That is, to provide basic DOCSIS 1.1 Multicast 
   capabilities, all NSI-facing interfaces (NSI on the CMTS and HFC-
   side on CM) need only present an IGMP Host interface to the external 
   multicast network. All Subscriber-facing interfaces (HFC-side on 
   CMTS and CPE-side on CM) need only present a Querier interface to 
   CPE. This is in contrast to a Multicast Router model where each 
   interface has both Host and Querier capabilities.  
    
   It is expected that the root of each Multicast session tree 
   originate from the NSI interface(s). Although not strictly 
   prohibited by the RFI, a more symmetrical model, where the root of a 
   Multicast group may be on the HFC/Subscriber-side, is discouraged. 
   In either case, Querying MUST only be in the downstream direction 
   (initiated by an NSI Querier or the CMTS itself). Host Membership 
   Reporting is expected to be in the upstream direction (from CPE or 
   active IGMP CM devices). The IGMPv2 MIB provides an excellent and 
   standard means for managing multicast within such a network. 
 
3.1       IGMP Capabilities: Active and Passive Mode 
    
   There are two basic modes of IGMP capability defined by the DOCSIS 
   1.1 RFI specification that are applicable to a DOCSIS 1.1 device. 
    
    o Passive IGMP Devices - The first mode is a passive operation in 
       which the device selectively forwards IGMP based upon the known 
       state of multicast session activity on the subscriber side (an 
       example of this is described in Appendix L of [23]). In passive 
       mode, the device derives its IGMP timers based on the rules 
       specified in section 3.3.1 of the RFI. 
      
    o Active IGMP Devices - The second mode is an active operation in 
       which the device terminates and initiates IGMP based upon the 
       known state of multicast session activity on the subscriber 
       side. One example of the latter, active, mode is commonly 
       referred to as an IGMP-Proxy implementation side (as described 
       in [21]). A more complete example of an active IGMP device is 
       that of a Multicast Router. 
    
   Passive IGMP devices do not initiate IGMP PDUs (i.e., report or 
   queries). Passive devices rely on an (upstream) device to transmit 
   IGMP Queries and a (downstream) device to transmit IGMP Membership 
   Reports and Leaves to manage session activity, e.g., a Multicast 
   Router and Multicast Host, respectively. In contrast, an active IGMP 
   device initiates IGMP PDUs (queries and/or reports) to manage 
   session activity.

   Although a specific implementation is not imposed, a DOCSIS 1.1 
   device MUST meet the requirements stated in section 3.3.1 of [23] 
   and MUST support the IDMR IGMP MIB, [20], and the Cable Device MIB, 
   [25], as described herein. As specified in the DOCSIS 1.1 RFI, 
   active CMs are explicitly prohibited from transmitting IGMP Queries 
   upstream onto the HFC. However, an active CMTS may transmit IGMP 
   Queries on any of its interfaces. 
    
    
3.2       IGMP Timers 
    
   The IGMP standard, [22], defines several timers that are applicable 
   to the management of Multicast session activity on a given 
   interface. Timers for DOCSIS 1.1 passive IGMP devices are derived 
   based on the requirements specified in section 3.3.1 of [23]. As 
   such, MIB objects that apply to these timers must be considered read 
   only values. IGMP timers in active devices should be considered 
   values that may be managed within the device. 
    
4.        DOCSIS 1.1 Interface and the IGMP MIB 
    
   DOCSIS 1.1 devices, CM and CMTS, MUST support the IDMR IGMP MIB 
   (RFC-2933), [20]. As such, the following sections describe the 
   application of RFC-2933 to DOCSIS 1.1 devices. 
    
   The IDMR IGMP MIB is organized into two distinct tables, the 
   interface and cache tables. The IGMP Interface Table contains 
   entries for each interface that supports IGMP on a device. For 
   DOCSIS 1.1 this includes the NSI and HFC for the CMTS and the HFC 
   and CMCI on the CM. The IGMP Cache Table contains one row for each 
   IP Multicast Group for which there are active members on a given 
   interface. Active membership MUST only exist on the CMCI of a Cable 
   Modem. However, active membership MAY exist on both the NSI and HFC 
   side interfaces of the CMTS. This is because a CMTS may be 
   implemented as a Multicast Router on which other network side 
   devices are actively participating in a multicast session. 
    
   Support of the IDMR IGMP MIB by DOCSIS 1.1 devices is presented in 
   terms of IGMP capabilities, the device type (CM or CMTS), and the 
   interface on which IGMP is supported. This is followed by a set of 
   new IGMP MIB conformance, compliance and group statements for DOCSIS 
   1.1 devices.

4.1       DOCSIS 1.1 CM Support for the IGMP MIB 
    
   There are two types of interfaces applicable to IGMP on the DOCSIS 
   1.1 CM. These are the HFC-Side and CMCI-Side interfaces, 
   respectively. Application of the IGMP MIB to DOCSIS 1.1 CMs is 
   presented in terms of passive and active CM operation and these two 
   interface types. 
 
 
4.1.1     igmpInterfaceTable -  igmpInterfaceEntry 
    
4.1.1.1   igmpInterfaceIfIndex 
    
   The ifIndex value of the interface for which IGMP is enabled. 
    
   All Modes / Both sides: same for passive and active modes. 
    
   HFC-side:  not-accessible. ifIndex of docsCableMaclayer(127), CATV 
               MAC Layer 
   CMCI-side: not-accessible. ifIndex of CMCI-Side interface. 
4.1.1.2   igmpInterfaceQueryInterval 
    
   The frequency at which IGMP Host-Query packets are transmitted on 
   this interface.

   HFC-side:  n/a, read-only. The CM MUST not transmit queries 
               upstream. Return a value of zero. 
   CMCI-side: read only . This value is derived based on the interval 
               of queries received from an upstream querier. 
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   HFC-side:  n/a, read-only. The CM MUST not transmit queries 
               upstream. Return a value of zero. 
   CMCI-side: read-create. Min = 0; Max =  (2^32 - 1); Default = 125 

                                     

4.1.1.3   igmpInterfaceStatus 
    
   The activation of a row enables IGMP on the interface. The 
   destruction of a row disables IGMP on the interface. 
    
   All Modes / Both sides: MUST be enabled on both interfaces for all 
   DOCSIS 1.1 CM interfaces. 
 
4.1.1.4   igmpInterfaceVersion 
   The version of IGMP which is running on this interface. 
    
   All Modes / Both sides: MUST be version 2 for all DOCSIS 1.1 CM 
   interfaces.

4.1.1.5   igmpInterfaceQuerier 
   The address of the IGMP Querier on the IP subnet to which this 
   interface is attached. 
    
   Passive Mode 
   ------------ 
   HFC-side:  read-only. MUST be the address of an upstream device for 
               both active and passive CMs. 
   CMCI-side: read-only. Same as HFC-side value. 
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   HFC-side:  read-only. MUST be the address of an upstream device for 
               both active and passive CMs. 
   CMCI-side: read-only. Active CMs may report it as the HFC-side 
               value. However, active CMs that participate in IGMP 
               Querier negotiation on the CMCI may report it as a 
               different CPE. 
    
4.1.1.6   igmpInterfaceQueryMaxResponseTime 
    
   The maximum query response time advertised in IGMPv2 queries on this 
   interface. 
    
   Passive Mode 
   ------------ 
   HFC-side:  n/a, read-only. return a value of zero. 
   CMCI-side: read-only. This value is derived from observation of 
               queries received from an upstream querier 
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   HFC-side:  n/a, read-only. return a value of zero.

4.1.1.8   igmpInterfaceQuerierExpiryTime 
    
   The amount of time remaining before the other querier present timer 
   expires. If the local system is the querier, the value of this 
   object is zero. 
    
   Passive Mode 
   ------------ 
   Both Sides: n/a, read-only. The CM is never the querier, return 0. 
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   HFC-side:  n/a, read-only. Return 0. 
   CMCI-side: read-only. The CM may only be the querier on the CMCI. 
 
4.1.1.9   igmpInterfaceVersion1QuerierTimer 
    
   The time remaining until the host assumes that there are no IGMPv1 
   routers present on the interface. While this is non-zero, the host 
   will reply to all queries with version 1 membership reports. 
    
   Passive Mode 
   ------------ 
   HFC-side:  n/a read-only. Return a value of zero. 
   CMCI-side: n/a read-only. Return a value of zero. 
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   HFC-side:  read-only. 
   CMCI-side: read-only. 
 
4.1.1.10  igmpInterfaceWrongVersionQueries 
    
   The number of queries received whose IGMP version does not match 
   igmpInterfaceVersion, over the lifetime of the row entry. IGMP 
   requires that all routers on a LAN be configured to run the same 
   version of IGMP. Although, DOCSIS 1.1 requires that all CM and CMTS 
   devices support IGMPv2, it is possible for an upstream querier to be 
   an IGMPv1 querier. 
    
   All Modes / Both sides - read-only. The number of non-v2 queries 
   received on this interface. 
    
4.1.1.11  igmpInterfaceJoins 
    
   The number of times a group membership has been added on this 
   interface; that is, the number of times an entry for this interface 
   has been added to the Cache Table. This object gives an indication 
   of the amount of IGMP activity over the lifetime of the row entry. 
    
   All HFC-side - n/a, read-only. Always return a value of zero (see 
   CMCI-side).

   All CMCI-side - read-only. Group membership is defined to only exist 
   on the CMCI. 
 
 

4.1.1.12  igmpInterfaceProxyIfIndex 
    
   Some devices implement a form of IGMP proxy whereby memberships 
   learned on the interface represented by this row, cause IGMP Host 
   Membership Reports to be sent on the interface whose ifIndex value 
   is given by this object. Such a device would implement the 
   igmpV2RouterMIBGroup only on its router interfaces (those interfaces 
   with non-zero igmpInterfaceProxyIfIndex). Typically, the value of 
   this object is 0, indicating that no proxy is being done. 
    
   Passive Mode 
   ------------ 
   Both side: read-only. Always return a value of zero. 
    
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   HFC-side:  read-only. Always return a value of zero. 
   CMCI-side: read-only. Always return ifIndex for HFC-side interface. 
 
4.1.1.13  igmpInterfaceGroups 
    
   The current number of entries for this interface in the Cache Table 
   (number of active sessions Proxied or Active on this Interface). 
    
   All HFC-side - n/a, read-only. Always return a value of zero (see 
   CMCI-side). 
    
   All CMCI-side - read-only. Group membership is defined to only exist 
   on the CMCI. 
    
4.1.1.14  igmpInterfaceRobustness 
    
   The robustness variable allows tuning for the expected packet loss 
   on a subnet. If a subnet is expected to be lossy, the robustness 
   variable may be increased. IGMP is robust to (robustness variable-1) 
   packet losses.

   CM. Although RFC 2236 does not explicitly state that the robustness 
   variable be used for this purpose, it is implied by the following 
   statement. 
              "To cover the possibility of the initial Membership 
               Report being lost or damaged, it is recommended that it 
               be repeated once or twice after short delays [Unsolicited 
               Report Interval].  (A simple way to accomplish this is to 
               send the initial Version 2 Membership Report and then act 
               as if a Group-Specific Query was received for that group, 
               and set a timer appropriately), [22]." 
    
   The Query Response Interval is derived from the last Max Response 
   Time received (or 10 seconds if none), and the number of 
   retransmissions is equal to the Robustness variable. 
    
4.1.1.15  igmpInterfaceLastMemberQueryIntvl 
    
   The last member query interval is the max response time inserted 
   into group specific queries sent in response to leave group 
   messages, and is also the amount of time between group specific 
   query messages. This value may be tuned to modify the leave latency 
   of the network. A reduced value results in reduced time to detect 
   the loss of the last member of a group.

4.2       DOCSIS 1.1 CMTS Support for the IGMP MIB 
    
   There are two types of interfaces applicable to IGMP on the DOCSIS 
   1.1 CMTS. These are the HFC-Side and NSI-Side interfaces, 
   respectively. Application of the IGMP MIB to a DOCSIS 1.1 CMTS is 
   presented in terms of passive and active CMTS operation and these 
   two interface types. In contrast to a CM, the CMTS is likely to have 
   several NSI-side interfaces and several HFC-side (subscriber-side) 
   interfaces. 
    
   It is important to note that an active IGMP capable CMTS may be 
   implemented as a proxy, router, or hybrid device. As such, the CMTS 
   may be capable of querying on both its NSI and HFC side interfaces 
   and may manage membership for devices on its NSI interfaces (e.g., 
   as a multicast router). This is different than an active CM, which 
   MUST NOT query on its HFC side interface (e.g., it may only query on 
   its CMCI). This capability is accounted for in the application of 
   the IGMP MIB to the CMTS. 
 
4.2.1     igmpInterfaceTable-  igmpInterfaceEntry 
 
4.2.1.1   igmpInterfaceIfIndex

               interface(s). 
   HFC-side:  not-accessible. ifIndex of docsCableMaclayer(127), CATV 
               MAC Layer interface. 
    
4.2.1.2   igmpInterfaceQueryInterval 
    
   The frequency at which IGMP Host-Query packets are transmitted on 
   this interface. 
    
   Passive Mode 
   ------------ 
   NSI-side:  n/a, read-only. Return a value of zero. 
   HFC-side:  read only . This value is derived based on the interval 
               of queries received from a Network Side querier. 
    
   Active Mode 
   ----------- 
   NSI-side:  read-create. Min = 0; Max =  (2^32 - 1); Default = 125

5.        DOCSIS 1.1 IGMP Mode Control and Cable Device MIB Support 
    
   The default mode of a DOCSIS 1.1 CM MUST be to support passive IGMP 
   operation. The default mode of a DOCSIS 1.1 CMTS SHOULD be to 
   support passive IGMP operation. No objects in the IDMR IGMP MIB 
   provide a consistent way to control this mode for a DOCSIS 1.1 
   device. One option considered was to overload the context of the 
   igmpInterfaceProxyIfIndex such that setting this object constitutes 
   active mode and clearing the object constitutes passive mode. The 
   problem is that this precludes implementation of a DOCSIS 1.1 device 
   as a multicast router. Another option was to overload the context of 
   the igmpInterfaceQueryInterval such that setting this object 
   constitutes active mode and clearing this object constitutes passive 
   mode. However, this precludes setting the query interval to zero. 
    
   The, unambiguous, solution to controlling DOCSIS 1.1 IGMP mode is to 
   define a new object. The following object is proposed as a new entry 
   to the docsDevBaseGroup in the Cable Device MIB, [25]. This object 
   is shown as read-write for devices that support both modes. For 
   devices that only support the required passive mode, this object is 
   specified to be read-only.

6.        Security Considerations 
 
   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
   internet access to multicast services. The security considerations 
   discussed in RFC 2933, [20], apply here as well. 
 
6.1       Additional DOCSIS IGMP Security Considerations 
    
   Although it is beyond the scope of this MIB application note, the 
   security of IGMP and IP Multicasting in a DOCSIS network is worth 
   further discussion. For example, improper transmission of IGMP PDUs 
   may result in unauthorized access to multicast services, and may 
   present 'denial-of-service' potential on the HFC (e.g., mischievous 
   users could simply flood the upstream with IGMP for sessions they 
   are not authorized to receive; the result being cluttering the 
   downstream with unauthorized and undesired multicast traffic). 
    
   Early discussions on IGMP within the IPCDN and DOCSIS communities 
   centered on conditional and timed multicast session activity. More 
   recent discussions have focused on a tighter coupling between the 
   Baseline Privacy Plus protocol, [24], and IGMP to resolve these 
   issues. Tying these protocols too tightly together may present 
   problems and complexity that is unwarranted during the early stages 
   of multicast deployments in DOCSIS networks. It is important to note 
   that a DOCSIS CM will never forward unauthorized and encrypted data 
   from the HFC to the CMCI as it will fail on the downstream Security 
   Association as defined by the BPI+ protocol. It is expected that 
   'non-destructive' users will give up trying to receive unauthorized 
   sessions (e.g., stop sending membership reports for sessions not 
   received). This will result in timing-out the session through normal 
   IGMP mechanisms (e.g., no one left sending MRs for this group). 
   Preventing denial-of-service is, perhaps, the greater security 
   concern for IGMP in a DOCSIS network. One approach is to establish 
   controls on the CMTS that consult BPI+ Authorization tables before 
   accepting IGMP Membership Reports from a given CM. 
 
6.1.1     Proposed Security Rules for DOCSIS IGMP 
    
   The following set of rules have been proposed to provide better 
   security for IGMP/IP Multicast in DOCSIS networks. The reader is 
   referred to the RFC 2236, [22], and the BPI+ specification, [24]. 
 
   NOTE: forwarding of IGMP, presented below, MUST be subject to permit 
   rules at the IP and IEEE802.2 MAC Layer. 
    
    o The CM MUST NOT forward IGMP PDUs (Membership Reports, Leaves, 
       etc.) upstream for Multicast Sessions that have been SA-MAP 
       Reply Rejected for authorization (e.g., this does not apply to 
       SA-MAP reject for unencrypted sessions).

   Discussion: this requires that the CM apply the following order to 
   forwarding of IGMP PDUs upstream. 
    
               If the IGMP PDU is for a Session that is new to the 
               CMCI-LAN, then the CM MUST NOT forward the PDU for this 
               Session until such time as a BPI+ SA-MAP Reply, with the 
               requested SA mapping, or a SA-Map Reject 'not mapped to 
               a SA' is received. Said another way, the CM MUST NOT 
               forward IGMP for Sessions that result in a SA-MAP Reject 
               not authorized for SA. The CM MUST continue to treat all 
               subsequent IGMP Membership Reports for this session as 
               being new and MUST result in a SA-MAP Request for this 
               traffic flow (Session).  
    
    o The CM MUST consider all Multicast Sessions, associated with a 
       given SA, inactive on the CMCI-LAN as soon as the TEK state 
       machine terminates for these sessions. That is, once the TEK 
       state machine terminates (either by a Key Reject or 
       Authorization Invalid), Multicast data for Sessions associated 
       with this SA MUST NOT be forwarded from the HFC to the CMCI AND 
       the CM MUST consider subsequent MRs for these Sessions as being 
       new (as described above). 
    
    o The CMTS SHOULD NOT process an IGMP PDU sent from/through a CM 
       if the MR is for a Session that is associated with Multicast 
       Addresses that has a SA (is encrypted) and is not authorized for 
       the CM (based on the HFC-side CM mac address). 
    
   Discussion: this requires that the CMTS consult the BPI+ 
   docsBpi2CmIpMulticastMapTable (IP Multicast Address to SAID) table 
   and the docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable (CMTS Multicast SAID 
   Authorization) table before processing IGMP messages (MR or Leave; 
   Queries are explicitly prohibited on the upstream). The following 
   rules apply. 
    
              If the IGMP is for a Multicast address that has an SA 
               and the CM from which this IGMP PDU was sent is 
               authorized for this SA, then process the IGMP (i.e., MRs 
               are reflected on downstream, and the NSI multicast 
               filters are removed to send downstream data, etc.) 
    
              If the IGMP is for a Multicast address that does not 
               have an SA, then process the IGMP. 
    
              If the IGMP is for a Multicast address that has an SA 
               and the CM from which this IGMP PDU was sent is not 
               authorized for this SA, then the IGMP PDU SHOULD be 
               silently discarded. 
    
    o The CMTS MAY stop forwarding Multicast data downstream for 
       Sessions that have an SA and for which there is no TEK state 
       machine running.
