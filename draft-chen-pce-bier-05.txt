                        PCEP Extensions for BIER
                         draft-chen-pce-bier-05

Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279].  BIER-TE forwards
   and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but
   every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one
   or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].BIER-TE
   Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE).

   This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) that allow a PCE to compute and initiate the path for
   the BIER-TE.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279].  BIER-TE forwards
   and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but
   every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one
   or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].BIER-TE
   Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE).

   [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP that allow a PCE to
   compute and recommend network paths in compliance with [RFC4657] and
   defines objects and TLVs for MPLS-TE LSPs.

   This document uses a PCE for computing one or more BIER-TE paths
   taking into account various constraints and objective functions.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

3.  Overview of PCEP Operation in BIER Networks

   BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on a BitString in the
   packet header, and every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE
   packet indicates one or more adjacencies as described in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].  In a PCEP session, An ERO object specified
   in [RFC5440] can be extended to carry a BIER-TE path consists of one
   or more BIER-ERO subobject(s).  BIER-TE computed by a PCE can be
   represented in the following forms:

   o  An ordered set of adjacencies BitString(s) in which each bit
      represents that the adjacencies to which the BFR should replicate
      packets to in the domain.

   In this document, we define a set of PCEP protocol extensions,
   including a new PCEP capability,a new Path Setup Type (PST) ,a new
   BIER END-POINT Object, new ERO subobjects, new PCEP error codes and
   procedures.

4.  Object Formats

4.1.  The OPEN Object

4.1.1.  The BIER-TE PCE Capability sub-TLV

   [RFC8408]defines the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV for use in the
   OPEN object.  The PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV contains an optional
   list of sub-TLVs which are intended to convey parameters that are
   associated with the path setup types supported by a PCEP speaker.

   This document defines a new Path Setup Type (PST) for BIER as
   follows:

   o  PST = TBD2: Path is setup using BIER Traffic Engineering
      technique.

   A PCEP speaker SHOULD indicate its support of the function described
   in this document by sending a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV in the
   OPEN object with this new PST included in the PST list.

   This document also defines the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  PCEP
   speakers use this sub-TLV to exchange BIER capability.  If a PCEP

   speaker includes PST=TBD1 in the PST List of the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV then it MUST also include the BIER-TE-PCE- CAPABILITY
   sub-TLV inside the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV.

   The format of the BIER-TE-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is shown in the
   following figure:


         0                   1                   2                   3

                                 Figure 1

   The code point for the TLV type is to be defined by IANA.

   Length: 4 bytes.

   The "Reserved" (2 octet) and "Flags" (2 octet) fields are currently
   unused, and MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

4.2.  The SRP Object

   In order to setup an BIER-TE, a new PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV MUST be
   contained in RP/SRP object.  This document defines a new Path Setup
   Type (PST=TBD2) for BIER-TE.

4.3.  END-POINTS object

4.3.1.  P2MP END-POINTS object

   The END-POINTS object which is defined in [RFC8306]is used in a PCReq
   message to specify the BIER information of the path for which a path
   computation is requested.  To represent the end points for a BIER
   path efficiently, we reuse the P2MP END-POINTS object body for
   IPv4(Object-Type 3) and END-POINTS object body for IPv6 (Object-Type
   4) which is defined in [RFC8306].

4.3.2.  The New BIER END-POINT Object

   In the case of BIER and BIER-TE coexistence scenario, we reuse the
   BFR-id where is assigned

   For each sub-domain to which a given BFR belongs, if the BFR is
   capable of acting as a BFIR or a BFER, it MUST be provisioned with a
   "BFR-id" that is unique within the sub-domain which is defined in
   [RFC8279], so in this scenario, we define a new BIER END-POINT
   Object.It is optional.

   The format of the new END-POINTS Object for BFR-id is as follows:



        0                   1                   2                   3

   leaf type: It is the same with the type which is defined in
   [RFC8306].

   Source BFR-id:A 2 octet field encoding the source BFR-id, A BFR-id is
   just a number in the range [1,65535], identifies a BFIR uniquely in a
   BIER subdomain.If no BFR-id has been assigned, the value of this
   field is set to "Invalid BFR-id", which is defined as illegal in
   [RFC8279].

   Destniation BFR-id:A 2 octet field encoding the destniation BFR-id.A
   BFR-id is just a number in the range [1,65535], identifies a BFER
   uniquely.If no BFR-id has been assigned, the value of this field is
   set to "Invalid BFR-id", which is defined as illegal in [RFC8279].

4.4.  ERO Object

   BIER-TE consists of one or more adjacencies BitStrings where every
   BitPosition of the BitString indicates one or more adjacencies, as
   described in([RFC8279]).

   The ERO object specified in [RFC5440] is used to encode the path of a
   TE LSP through the network.The ERO is carried within a PCRep message
   to provide the computed TE LSP if the path computation was

   successful.In order to carry BIER-TE explicit paths, this document
   defines a new ERO subobjects referred to as "BIER-ERO subobjects"
   whose formats are specified in the following section.  An BIER-ERO
   subobjects carrying a adjacencies BitStrings consists of one or more
   BIER-ERO subobject(s).

                                 Figure 3

   The 'L' Flag: Indicates whether the subobject represents a loose-hop
   in the LSP[RFC3209].  If the bit is not set, the subobject represents
   a strict hop in the explicit route.

   Type: TBD4

   Length: 1 octet ([RFC3209]).  Contains the total length of the
   subobject in octets.  The Length MUST be at least 8, and MUST be a
   multiple of 4.

   BS Length: A 1 octet field encodes the length in bits of the
   BitString as per [RFC8296], the maximum length of the BitString is 5,
   it indicates the length of BitString is 1024.It is used to refer to
   the number of bits in the BitString.

   subdomain-id: Unique value identifying the BIER subdomain. 1 octet.

   SI: Set Identifier (Section 1 of [RFC8279] used in the encapsulation
   for this BIER subdomain for this BitString length, 1 octet.

   The "Reserved" (1 octets) fields are currently unused, and MUST be
   set to zero on transmission and ignored on reception.

   Adjacency BitString: a variable length field encoding the Adjacency
   BitString where every BitPosition of the BitString indicates one or
   more adjacencies.the length of this field is according the BS length.
   The minimum value of this field is 64 bits, and the maximum value of
   this field is 1024 bits.

   Notice:

   The maximum value of BS Length is limited to the 1024 bits, in case
   the BIER-ERO Subobject is too long.

4.4.2.  BIER-ERO Processing

   The ERO and SR-ERO subobject processing remains as per [RFC5440].

   If a PCC receives an BIER-ERO subobject in which either
   BitStringLength or Adjacency BitString or SI is absent, it MUST
   consider the entire BIER-ERO subobject invalid and send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object"),
   Error-Value = TBD5 ("BitStringLength is absent ") or Error-Value =
   TBD6 ("Adjacency BitString is absent")or Error-Value = TBD7("SI is
   absent ").

   If a PCC receives an BIER-ERO subobject in which BitStringLength
   values are not chosen from: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, as it described
   in ( [RFC8279]).  The PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type
   =10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-Value = TBD8
   ("Invalid BitStringLength").
