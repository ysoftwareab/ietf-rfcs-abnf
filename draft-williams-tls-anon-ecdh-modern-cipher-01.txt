1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol supports a mode
   where key exchange is done without authenticating either the client
   nor the server to each other.  This is done with ciphersuites using
   "anonymous" key agreement algorithms.

   TLS ciphersuites are distinct sets of key agreement, server
   authentication, data encryption and integrity protection ciphers (and
   cipher modes), and pseudo-random functions (PRF).  Each set that one
   might desire to use must be registered in the IANA TLS ciphersuite
   registry.

   In recent years new, more modern ciphersuites have been added, but
   none with support for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [RFC4492]
   key agreement algorithms.  This is problematic because ECDH is more
   efficient (both, in terms of compute and network bandwidth
   resources), and is generally thought to be more secure than the
   alternative.  Thus implementations that want anonymous connections
   must trade-off security and performance in key agreement for security
   and performance in data encryption and integrity protection.

   Note that there are good reasons to use anonymous ciphersuites, such
   as:

   o  to protect against passive attackers even when there's no way to
      authenticate the peer;

   o  to protect the identity of the server and/or the identity of the
      server as requested by the client in the server name indication
      (SNI) TLS extension -- here the client initiates a renegotiation
      with the protection of the outer, unauthenticated connection.

   This is not an exhaustive list.

   This document requests the allocation -and registration- of
   ciphersuite codepoints for at least some of the missing ciphersuites,
   specifically, the sets of ciphersuites resulting from the cartesian
   product of:

   o  ECDH for key agreement, with ephemeral keys

   o  no server authentication

   o  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [AES] for data encryption with
      the following key sizes:

      *  128-bit keys

      *  256-bit keys

   o  Two block cipher modes for authenticated encryption with
      additional data (AEAD):

      *  Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) [RFC3610] [CCM]

      *  Galois Counter Mode [GCM]

   o  Two hash functions for the TLS PRF:

      *  SHA256 [RFC4634]

      *  SHA384 [RFC4634]

   filtered such that block cipher key lengths are matched to PRF hash
   functions as follows:

   o  128-bit key-length ciphers should use SHA256 for the PRF

   o  256-bit key-length ciphers should use SHA384 for the PRF

   That's four new ciphersuites, see Section 3.

   [[anchor1: Should such ciphersuites for Camellia and other
   alternative block ciphers also be registered by this document?]]

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no new security considerations here beyond those that are
   described in each of the documents normatively referenced here.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Pursuant to the TLS ciphersuite registry's allocation policy
   (Standards Action or Specification Required [RFC2434]), upon IESG
   Standards Action publishing this document on the Proposed Standards
   track, or acceptance by the RFC-Editor of this document for
   publication on the Informational track, the IANA should assign
   ciphersuite codepoints to the following ciphersuites, and add them to
   the TLS ciphersuite registry:

   TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  This is anonymous key
      agreement with ephemeral ECDH keys, with AES-128 in GCM mode, and
      SHA256 as the hash function for the TLS PRF.

   TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256  This is anonymous key
      agreement with ephemeral ECDH keys, with AES-128 in CCM mode, and
      SHA256 as the hash function for the TLS PRF.

   TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384  This is anonymous key
      agreement with ephemeral ECDH keys, with AES-256 in GCM mode, and
      SHA384 as the hash function for the TLS PRF.

   TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_AES_256_CCM_SHA384  This is anonymous key
      agreement with ephemeral ECDH keys, with AES-256 in CCM mode, and
      SHA384 as the hash function for the TLS PRF.
