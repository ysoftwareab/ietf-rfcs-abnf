               Updating the IANA MPLS LSP Ping Parameters
             draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registries-update-08

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 8029 and RFC 8611 which both define IANA
   registries for MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping.  It also updates
   the description of the procedures for the responses sent when an
   unknown or erroneous code point is found.  The updates are to clarify
   and align this namespace with recent developments.

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries             February 2021


1.  Introduction

   There were a number of reasons to start the work that has led to this
   document, e.g.:

   o  When the LSP Ping registry was created it was incorrectly assumed
      that code points allocated by Experimental RFCs would be
      'experimental' code points; a code point made available in a
      public IANA registry is not limited by the type of RFC that made
      the allocation but is available for any document.

   o  The number of 'experimental' code points was also too large, as
      compared to what is normally allocated for "Experimental Use".

   o  RFC 8029 uses the words "mandatory" and "optional" differently to
      how other RFC do.  RFC 8029 for example talks about mandatory TLVs
      to indicate that it is mandatory to take a certain action if the
      TLV is found in a message but not recognized, other RFCs uses
      "mandatory TLV" to indicate a TLV that must be present in a
      message.

   Over time there hav been attempts to administratively update some of
   the registries, but it was soon decided that an RFC was needed.
   Other, often minor, potential updates were found, e.g. reserving the
   value 0 (zero) in registries where that is possible.

   When RFC 8029 [RFC8029] was published it contained updates to the
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   Ping Parameters" IANA namespace [IANA-LSP-PING].

   RFC 8611 [RFC8611] updated the LSP Ping IANA registries to match RFC
   8029.  This document further clarifies the entries in those
   registries and makes the definitions more precise.

   This document updates RFC 8029 [RFC8029] and RFC 8611 [RFC8611] by
   updating two groups of registries as follows:

   First the registries for Message Types [IANA-MT], Reply Modes
   [IANA-RM] and Return Codes [IANA-RC] are updated.  The changes to
   these registries are minor.

   Second, this document updates the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  TLVs [IANA-TLV-reg].

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLVs 1, 16 and 21 [IANA-Sub-1-16-21].

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6 [IANA-Sub-6].

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries             February 2021


   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 11 [IANA-Sub-11].

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 20 [IANA-Sub-20].

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 23 [IANA-Sub-23].

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 27 [IANA-Sub-27].

   The registry for sub-TLVs for TLV 9 [IANA-Sub-9] is not updated.

   Third, some code points (TLVs and sub-TLVs) are "mandatory" or
   "optional".  Contrary to how other RFCs use these words, indicating
   that it is mandatory or optional to include the code points in a
   message, RFC 8029 uses these words to indicate that an action might
   or might not be mandatory.  This document updates RFC 8029 to drop
   the words "mandatory" and "optional", and the text is changed to
   focus on what should be done.

1.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   This section list terms that are just to discuss IANA registers
   (Section 1.2.1) and abbreviations used in IANA registries update in
   this document (Section 1.2.2).

1.2.1.  Terminology Used in this Document

   This document uses some terms that relates to IANA registries in this
   way:

      IANA Name Space,
      a namespace is a top level registry.  An example could be
      "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
      Ping Parameters" [IANA-LSP-PING].  A namespace is most often a
      container for registries that hold code points that share some
      affinity.

      IANA Registry,
      an IANA registry holds code points, and lists the registration
      procedures and allocation of code points these code points.  One
      example would be the "TLVs" registry [IANA-TLV-reg].

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries             February 2021


      IANA Sub-registry,
      a sub-registry is used when a code point, or a set of code points
      allocated in a single registry, needs "sub-code points" scoped by
      the code point or the set of code points.  An example of a sub-
      registry that holds code points for more than one TLV is
      "Sub-TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21" [IANA-Sub-1-16-21]

1.2.2.  Abbreviations

   This section list abbreviations used in the unchanged part of the
   registries updated by this document, these abbreviations were
   originally expanded in the document defining the registries.  They
   are listed here following the requirement to expand any abbreviation
   that is not well-known.  All these abbreviations are from the same
   registry (Assignments for the Return Codes registry).

      BFD - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

      DDMAP - Downstream Detailed Mapping

      FEC - Forwarding Equivalence Class

      OAM - Operation, Administration and Maintenance

      PM - Performance Monitoring

      RSC - Return Subcode

2.  Updating the Message Types, Reply Mode and Return Codes Registries

   The following changes are made to the Message Types [IANA-MT], Reply
   Modes [IANA-RM] and Return Codes [IANA-RC] registries.

   o  In the listing of assigned code points the term "Vendor Private
      Use" is changed to "Private Use".

   o  The registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed.

   o  A small set of code points (4 code points) for Experimental Use is
      added by reducing the "RFC Required" range.

   o  The registration procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"
      are added to the table of registration procedures.

   o  A note "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use".

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries             February 2021


   o  In the lists that capture the assignment status, the fields that
      are reserved, i.e., 0 (zero), Private Use and Experimental Use are
      clearly marked as such.

      *  Note that in the Return Codes registry [IANA-RC] the code point
         "0" has already been assigned.  This assignment is not changed
         and in this registry the code point "0" continues to be
         assigned as "No Return Code".

   The new Registration Procedures, the registry layouts and the new
   assignments for these registries are found in Section 6.1.

3.  Updating the TLV and Sub-TLV Registries

3.1.  General Principles for the LSP Ping TLV and Sub-TLV registries

   The following principles apply to the processing of any TLV from any
   of the LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV IANA registries.

   o  All TLVs and sub-TLVs with a type in the range 0-32767 require a
      response if they are not recognized.

   o  All TLVs and sub-TLVs in the range 32768-65535 may be silently
      dropped, stepped over or an error message sent if they are not
      recognized.

   Each of the blocks has code point spaces with the following
   registration procedures:

   o  Standards Action.

   o  RFC Required.

   o  Experimental Use.

   o  First Come First Served (FCFS).

   The exact definitions of these procedures are found in [RFC8126].

3.1.1.  Unrecognized Experimental Use TLVs and Sub-TLVs

   Unrecognized TLVs and sub-TLVs in the Experimental Use, and FCFS
   ranges are handled as any other unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV.

   o  If the unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV is from the Experimental Use
      range (31740-31743) or from the FCFS range (31744-32767) a Return
      Code of 2 ("One or more of the TLVs was not understood") must be
      sent in the echo response.

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries             February 2021


   o  If the unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV is from the Experimental Use
      range (64508-64511)or from the FCFS range (64512-65535) the TLVs
      may be silently ignored, stepped over or an error message sent.

   The IETF does not prescribe how recognized or unrecognized
   Experimental Use and Private Use TLVs and sub-TLVs are handled in
   experimental or private networks, that is up to the agency running
   the experimental or the private network.  The statement above
   describes how standards compliant implementations must treat the
   unrecognized TLVs and sub-TLVs from these ranges.

3.2.  Common Registration Procedures for TLVs and sub-TLVs

   This section describes the new registration procedures for the TLV
   and sub-TLV registries.

3.3.  Changes to the LSP Ping Registries

   This section lists the changes to each MPLS LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV
   Registry, see section 6.2.1 to 6.2.7 describe how the new versions of
   the IANA registries should look, together with the registration
   procedures for each registry.

   The new Registration Procedures description and the new assignments
   for these registries are used to model the changed MPLS LSP Ping
   registries, see Section 6.

3.3.1.  Common Changes to the TLV and Sub-TLV Registries

   The following changes are made to the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  The registration procedures "First Come First Served (FCFS)" and
      "Experimental Use" are added to the table of registration
      procedures.

   o  Two small sets of code points (4 code points each) for
      Experimental Use, are created.  The first set is for the range
      that requires a response if the TLV or sub-TLV is not recognized;
      the second set is for the range there the TLV or sub-TLV that may
      be silently dropped if not recognized.  The code points for
      experimental use are taken from the ranges previously called
      'Vendor Private Use', the remainder of which now form part of 'RFC
      Required'.

   o  The registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed.

   o  In the listing of assignments the term "Vendor Private Use" is
      changed to "First Come First Served (FCFS)".

   o  In the listing of assignments the range for "Experimental Use" is
      added.

   o  A note saying "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Experimental Use".

   o  In the list that captures assignment status, the fields that are
      reserved, i.e., 0 (zero) and Experimental Use are clearly marked.

4.  Updates to Related RFCs

   Some referenced RFCs use the concept "mandatory TLVs" and "mandatory
   sub-TLVs" to indicate that, if a TLV or sub-TLV of the range 0-32767
   in a message is not understood, an error message needs to be sent in
   response.

   The same RFCs use "optional TLVs" and "optional sub-TLVs" to mean
   TLVs or sub-TLVs that can be silently ignored if not recognized.

   Since other RFCs use "mandatory TLVs" and "mandatory sub-TLVs" to
   indicate TLVs and sub-TLVs that must be present in a message, we want
   to discontinue the use of "mandatory" to indicate TLVs and sub-TLVs
   that require an error message in response if not understood.  The
   changes to the RFCs below align with this practice.

4.1.  Updates to RFC 8029

   Mandatory and optional are used to indicate whether a response is
   needed if a TLV or sub-TLV is not understood on pages 14 and 15 in
   Section 3 of RFC 8029.

   The text in those two paragraphs is now updated to the following:

      TLV and sub-TLV Types less than 32768 (i.e., with the high-order
      bit equal to 0) are TLVs and sub-TLVs that MUST either be
      supported by an implementation or result in the Return Code of 2
      ("One or more of the TLVs was not understood") being sent in the
      echo response.

      An implementation that does not understand or support a received
      TLV or sub-TLV with Type greater than or equal to 32768 (i.e.,
      with the high-order bit equal to 1) SHOULD ignore and step over
      the TLV or sub-TLV, however an implementation MAY send an echo
      response with Return Code 2 ("One or more of the TLVs was not
      understood") as it would have done if the high order bit had been
      clear.

   In Section 3.8 of RFC 8029 "mandatory" is used in the same way.  The
   first two paragraphs of this section are now updated to read as
   follows:

      The following TLV is a TLV that MAY be included in an echo reply
      to inform the sender of an echo request that includes TLVs or sub-
      TLVs Types less than 32768 (i.e., with the high-order bit equal to
      0) are either not supported by the implementation or parsed and
      found to be in error.

      The Value field contains the TLVs, including sub-TLVs, that were
      not understood, encoded as sub-TLVs.

4.2.  Updates to RFC 8611

   Section 13.4.1 of "Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping and Traceroute
   Multipath Support for Link Aggregation Group (LAG) Interfaces
   [RFC8611]" defines "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" [IANA-Sub-6].

   The "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" registry is now updated to align with
   changes defined in this document.

   Section 13.4.1 of RFC 8611 is now updated as follows:

   IANA has created a new sub-registry "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6"
   [IANA-Sub-6] under the "TLVs" registry [IANA-TLV-reg] of the
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   Ping Parameters" namespace [lsp-ping-Namespace].

   The "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" sub-registry is now updated to align
   with changes defined in this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document updates IANA registries.  It also updates terminology
   used to define, and clarifies the terminology related to, the code
   points in the registries.  The document does not change how the code-

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries             February 2021


   points in the registries are used.  This should not create any new
   threats.

   However, the updated terminology and the clarifications improve
   security because it makes it more likely that implementations will be
   consistent and harder to attack.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" namespace
   [IANA-LSP-PING] as described in this document.

   See Section 1.2.1 "Terminology Used in this Document" to see how
   "namespace", "registry" and "sub-registry" are used in this document.

   In other parts of this document the communality of the changes to the
   LSP Ping registries has been the focus.  For the IANA considerations
   each changed registry has been described in its own right.

   The following registries and sub-registries are changed:

   "Message Types", [IANA-MT],
   "Reply Modes", [IANA-RM]
   "Return Codes" [IANA-RC]
   "TLVs" [IANA-TLV-reg]
   "Sub-TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21" [IANA-Sub-1-16-21]
   "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" [IANA-Sub-6]
   "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 11" [IANA-Sub-11]
   "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 20" [IANA-Sub-20]
   "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 23" [IANA-Sub-23]
   "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 27" [IANA-Sub-27]

   At the top of each of these registries a reference to this document
   should be added making the header of the registeries look like this:

      [Registry Name]
      Expert(s)
      Mach Chen and Carlos Pignataro

6.1.  Updates to the Message Type, Reply Mode and Return Codes
      Registries

   This section details the updated registration procedures and
   allocations for "Message Type", "Reply Mode" and "Return Codes"
   registries.

6.1.1.  Updates to the Message Type registry

   This is the changes to the "Message Type" registry specified in this
   document:

   o  Code Point 0 (zero) is marked Reserved.

   o  The registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the comment "Experimental RFC needed" is
      removed.

   o  Four code point have been taken from what was earlier
      "Specification Required" to form a set of code points for
      "Experimental Use."

6.2.  Updates to the TLV and Sub-TLV registries

   The updates to the TLV and the sub-TLV registries are mostly the
   same, however the Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 9 [IANA-Sub-9] have not been
   updated.

   Note that when a field in an assignment table says "EQ", it means
   that there is no change from the existing field in the "Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters"
   namespace [IANA-LSP-PING]

6.2.1.  Updates to the TLVs registry

   This section describes the new registration procedures and the
   assignments for the "TLVs" registry [IANA-TLV-reg] based on the new
   registration procedures.

   The registration procedures have been changed, as follows, for the
   "TLVs" registry.

   o  The "Specification Required" registration procedure has been
      changed to "RFC Required", the comment "Experimental RFC Required"
      has been removed.  Note that when a field in an assignment table
      says "EQ", it means that there is no change from the existing
      field in the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched
      Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" namespace [IANA-LSP-PING].

   o  The code points registration procedure "Vendor Private Use" has
      been removed and replaced with "First Come, First Served" code
      points.

   o  Two small sets, 4 code points each, have been created for
      Experimental Use.

   o  Code points that are reserved are clearly marked as such.

   o  The assignments have been updated to match the new registration
      procedures.

   o  The notes related to the registration procedures have been changed
      to reflect whether a response is required or not if a TLV is not
      recognized.

   The registration procedures for the "TLVs" registry [IANA-TLV-reg]
   will now look like this:

   This section describes the new registration procedures and the
   assignments for the "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 23" [IANA-Sub-23] sub-
   registry based on the new registration procedures.

   o  The "Specification Required" registration procedure has been
      changed to "RFC Required", the comment "Experimental RFC Required"
      has been removed.

   o  The code points registration procedure "Vendor Private Use" has
      been removed and replaced with "First Come, First Served" code
      points.

   o  Two small sets, 4 code points each, have been created for
      Experimental Use.

   o  Code points that are reserved are clearly marked as such.

   o  The assignments have been updated to match the new registration
      procedures.

   o  The notes related to the registration procedures have been changed
      to reflect whether a response is required or not if a sub-TLV is
      not recognized.
