Abstract

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is regarded as a popular
   encapsulation tunnel technology.  When a node tries to encapsulate
   the user traffic in GRE, it needs the IP address of the destination
   node which decapsulates the GRE packets.  In practice, the GRE tunnel
   destination IP addresses are mainly configured manually.  This
   configuration mechanism causes efficiency issues for operators.  This
   document proposes an approach to configure the GRE information
   dynamically.

1.  Introduction

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE, [RFC1701], [RFC2784]) is widely
   deployed in the operators' networks.  When a node tries to
   encapsulate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs the IP address
   of the destination node which decapsulates the GRE packets.

   In practice, the GRE tunnel destination IP addresses are mainly
   configured manually on the nodes.  This configuration mechanism
   causes efficiency issues for operators.  As an example, when GRE
   tunneling is used in the access network, there may a large amount of
   configuration needed at the access side.  Also, the configuration is
   rigid.  It may cause more issues in renumbering scenarios.

   This document introduces a use case requiring the deployment of a
   large amount of GRE tunnels, which motivates a dynamic approach.
   This document proposes a solution to enable the dynamic discovery of
   the GRE decapsulation device using Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP).

2.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

   Access Controller (AC)  The network entity that provides Wireless
      Termination Point (WTP) access to the network infrastructure in
      the data plane, control plane, management plane, or a combination
      therein.

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)  The box that a provider may
      distribute to the customers.  When CPE is using DHCP to obtain
      network address, CPE is acting as "DHCP Client".

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP)  The physical or logical network
      entity that contains an RF antenna and wireless physical layer
      (PHY) to transmit and receive station traffic for wireless access
      networks.

3.  GRE Use Case - WLAN Network

   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) has emerged as an important access
   technology for service operators.  A typical WLAN network contains a
   large number of WTPs, centrally managed and controlled by the Access
   Controller (AC).  It is desirable to distribute customer data frames
   to an endpoint through an Access Router (AR) different from the AC.
   GRE encapsulation can be used between a WTP and an AR as one of the
   optional tunneling technologies shown in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel]

   An illustration of a WLAN network is shown in Figure 1.  In order for
   a WTP to encapsulate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs to
   know the Access Router (AR) IP address.  This IP address is usually
   configured on WTPs manually.  An AC may dynamically configure the WTP
   with the AR address via extended CAPWAP message elements (see
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel]).

                  Figure 1: GRE Use Case - WLAN Network 1

   However, this approach does not apply to a WLAN network where the
   CAPWAP protocol is not deployed, as the network shown in Figure 2.
   In fact, it is quite common for operators to have their own private
   control plane between the WTP and the AC rather than CAPWAP.

         Private Control  +--------+
                ++========+   AC   |

                  Figure 2: GRE Use Case - WLAN Network 2

   Moreover, there are also WLAN deployments without AC, as in the fat
   WTPs scenario (see Figure 3).  A general approach to resolve this
   problem is desirable.

4.  Dynamic GRE Tunnel Overview

   The DHCP options defined in Section 5 enable an automated way to
   inform the GRE encapsulator with the GRE destination IP address.
   Additionally, some other GRE tunnel information may be provided.  In
   this way, a GRE tunnel can be setup dynamically.

   Figure 4 illustrates the procedure to set up a dynamic GRE tunnel in
   the network (only in IPv4 network scenario).

                       Figure 4: Dynamic GRE Tunnel

   The steps to set up a GRE tunnel between the CPE and the AR are as
   follows:

   1.  The CPE, as one endpoint of GRE tunnel, sends the DHCPREQUEST
       message to the DHCP server to acquire the AR access.  The GRE
       DHCP Option should be included in Parameter List Option, as
       defined in Section 6.2.  When the DHCP server receives this
       request, it replies to the CPE the DHCPACK message, containing
       the AR address and the tunnel information if needed.

   2.  The CPE can encapsulate the upstream packets from the hosts
       within GRE tunnel packets.  Generally, upstream packets are
       either data packets or control packets.  When the AR gets an
       encapsulated GRE tunnel packet, the AR checks whether there is an
       existing GRE tunnel with the CPE.  If this is a new endpoint
       without GRE record, the AR should add this CPE into the tunnel
       client list.  This would be mainly used for the correspondent
       downstream packets.

   3.  A keepalive mechanism may be required for a GRE tunnel between
       the CPE and the AR.  If there is neither keepalive packet nor
       data packet, when a keepalive timer expires, the AR or the CPE
       will tear down the tunnel and release resources.

5.  DHCP Options Definition

   This section defines the new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options that support
   the Dynamic stateless GRE tunnel.

6.  DHCP/DHCPv6 server and client behaviors

   This section defines the DHCP/DHCPv6 server and client behaviors
   during the procedure of configure GRE options.

6.1.  DHCP Server Behavior

   Section 3.5 of [RFC2131] describes how a DHCP client and server
   negotiate configuration values using the Parameter List (55) option
   [RFC2132].  By default, a server will not reply with a GRE option if
   the client has not explicitly enumerated one in its Parameter List

6.2.  DHCP Client Behavior

   A WTP/CPE acting as DHCP client will request DHCP GRE configuration
   parameters from the DHCP server located in the IPv4 network.  Such a
   client MUST request the DHCP GRE option(s) that it is configured for
   in Parameter List option in its DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, or
   DHCPINFORM messages.

   The client SHOULD use the received GRE destination address and
   information to establish GRE tunnels.

6.3.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Section 17.2.2 of [RFC3315] describes how a DHCPv6 client and server
   negotiate configuration values using the Option Request (6)
   Option[RFC3315].  By default, a server will not reply with a GRE
   option if the client has not explicitly enumerated one in its ORO.

6.4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A WTP/CPE acting as DHCPv6 client will request DHCPv6 GRE
   configuration parameters from the DHCPv6 server located in the IPv6
   network.  Such a client MUST request the GRE option(s) that it is
   configured for in its ORO in SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND or
   INFORMATION-REQUEST messages.

   The client SHOULD use the received GRE destination address and
   information to establish GRE tunnels.

7.  Security Considerations

   Section 23 of [RFC3315] discusses DHCPv6-related security issues.  As
   with all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is possible that
   configuration is actually being delivered by a third party (Man In
   The Middle).  As such, there is no basis on which access over the
   stateless GRE tunnel can be trusted.  Therefore, the stateless GRE
   tunnel should not bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls
   or user authentication.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new DHCPv4 [RFC2131] options.  The IANA is
   requested to assign values for these four options from the DHCPv4
   Option Codes table of the DHCPv4 Parameters registry maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters.  The four
   options are:

      The GRE Discovery Option (TBA1), described in Section 5.1.

      The GRE Information Option (TBA2), described in Section 5.2.

   This document defines three new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options.  The IANA
   is requested to assign values for these three options from the DHCPv6
   Option Codes table of the DHCPv6 Parameters registry maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters.  The three options
   are:

      The GRE Discovery Option (TBA3), described in Section 5.3.

      The GRE Information Option (TBA4), described in described in
      Section 5.4.
