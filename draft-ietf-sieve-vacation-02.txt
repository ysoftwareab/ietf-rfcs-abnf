Internet-Draft               Sieve Vacation                   April 2005


1.  Introduction

   This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [RFC3028] for
   notification that messages to a particular recipient will not be
   answered immediately.

   Conventions for notations are as in [RFC3028] section 1.1.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "CAN", and
   "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  Capability Identifier

   Sieve implementations that implement vacation have an identifier of
   "vacation" for use with the capability mechanism.

3.  Vacation Action

   Syntax:   vacation [":days" number] [":subject" string]
                      [":from" string] [":addresses" string-list]
                      [":mime"] [":handle" string] <reason: string>

   The "vacation" action implements a vacation autoresponder similar to
   the vacation command available under many versions of Unix.  Its
   purpose is to provide correspondents with notification that the user
   is away for an extended period of time and that they should not
   expect quick responses.

   "Vacation" is used to respond to a message with another message.
   Vacation's messages are always addressed to the Return-Path address
   (that is, the envelope from address) of the message being responded
   to.

3.1  Days Parameter

   The ":days" argument is used to specify the period in which addresses
   are kept and are not responded to, and is always specified in days.
   The minimum value used for this parameter is normally 1.  Sites MAY
   define a different minimum value as long as the minimum is greater
   than 0.  Sites MAY also define a maximum days value, which MUST be
   greater than 7, and SHOULD be greater than 30.

   If ":days" is omitted, the default value is either 7 or the minimum
   value (as defined above), whichever is greater.

   If the parameter given to ":days" is less than the minimum value,
   then the minimum value is used instead.

Internet-Draft               Sieve Vacation                   April 2005


   If ":days" exceeds the site-defined maximum, the site-defined maximum
   is used instead.

3.2  Previous Response Tracking

   "Vacation" keeps track of all of the responses it has sent to each
   address in some period (as specified by the :days optional argument).
   If vacation has not previously sent the response to this address
   within the given time period, it sends the "reason" argument to the
   SMTP MAIL FROM address of the message that is being responded to.
   (The SMTP MAIL FROM address should be available in the Return-path:
   header field if Sieve processing occurs after final delivery.)

   Tracking is not just per address, but must also take the vacation
   response itself into account.  A script writer might, for example,
   have a vacation action that will send a general notice only once in
   any two-week period.  However, even if a sender has received this
   general notice, it may be important to send a specific notice when a
   message about something timely or something specific has been
   detected.

   A particular vacation response can be identified in one of two ways.
   The first way is via an explicit :handle argument, which attaches a
   name to the response.  All vacation statements that use the same
   handle will be considered to be the same response for tracking
   purposes.

   The second way is via a synthesis of the :subject, :from, :mime, and
   reason vacation command arguments.  All vacation actions that do not
   contain an explicit handle and which use an identical combination of
   these arguments are considered to be the same for tracking purposes.

   For instance, If coyote@desert.example.org sends mail to
   roadrunner@acme.example.com twice, once with the subject "Cyrus bug"
   and once with the subject "come over for dinner", and
   roadrunner@acme.example.com has the script shown below,
   coyote@desert.example.org would receive two responses, once with the
   first message, once with the second.

   require "vacation";
   if header :contains "subject" "cyrus" {
       vacation "I'm out -- send mail to cyrus-bugs";
   } else {
       vacation "I'm out -- call me at 304 555 1212";
   }

   In the above example, coyote@desert.example.org gets the second
   message despite having gotten the first one because separate vacation

Internet-Draft               Sieve Vacation                   April 2005


   responses have been triggered.  This behavior is REQUIRED.

   There is one important exception to this rule, however.  If the sieve
   variables extension [I-D.ietf-sieve-variables] is used, the arguments
   MUST NOT have undergone variable expansion prior to their use in
   response tracking.  This is so that examples like the following
   script will only generate a single response to each incomining
   message with a different subject line.

   require ["vacation", "variables"];
   if header :matches "subject" "*" {
       vacation :subject "Automatic response to: ${1}"
                "I'm away -- send mail to foo in my absence";
   }

   As noted above, the optional ":handle" parameter can be used to tell
   the Sieve interpreter to treat two vacation actions with different
   arguments as the same command for purposes of response tracking.  The
   argument to ":handle" is a string that identifies the type of
   response being sent.  For instance, if tweety@cage.example.org sends
   mail to spike@doghouse.example.com twice, one with the subject
   "lunch?" and once with the subject "dinner?", and
   spike@doghouse.example.com has the script shown below,
   tweety@cage.example.org will only receive a single response.  (Which
   response is sent depends on the order in which the messages are
   processed.)

   require "vacation";
   if header :contains "subject" "lunch" {
       vacation :handle "ran-away" "I'm out and can't meet for lunch";
   } else {
       vacation :handle "ran-away" "I'm out";
   }

   NOTE: One way to implement the necessary mechanism here is to store a
   hash of either the current handle and the recipient or, if no handle
   is provided, a hash of the vacation action parameters specifying the
   message content and the recipient.  If a script is changed,
   implementations MAY reset the records of who has been responded to
   and when they have been responded to.

   Implementations are free to limit the number of remembered responses,
   provided the limit is no less than 1000.  When limiting the number of
   tracked responses, implementations SHOULD discard the oldest ones
   first.

Internet-Draft               Sieve Vacation                   April 2005


3.3  Subject and from parameters

   The ":subject" parameter specifies a subject line to attach to any
   vacation response that is generated.  UTF-8 characters can be used in
   the string argument; implementations MUST convert the string to
   [RFC2047] encoded words if non-ASCII characters are present.
   Implementations SHOULD insert an apppropriate default subject line if
   no :subject parameter is specified.

   A ":from" parameter MAY be used to specify an alternate address to
   use in the From field of vacation messages.  The string must specify
   a valid [RFC2822] mailbox-list.  Implementations SHOULD check the
   syntax and generate an error when a syntactically invalid ":from"
   parameter is specified.  Implementations MAY also impose security
   restrictions on what addresses can specified in a ":from" parameter;
   it is suggested that values which fail such a security check simply
   be ignored rather than causing the vacation action to fail.

3.4  MIME Parameter

   The ":mime" parameter, if supplied, specifies that the reason string
   is, in fact, a MIME entity as defined in [RFC2045] section 2.4,
   including both MIME headers and content (see section 2.4.2.4 of
   [RFC3028]).

   If the optional :mime parameter is not supplied, the reason string is
   considered to be a UTF-8 string.

3.5  Address Parameter and Limiting Replies to Personal Messages

   "Vacation" MUST NOT respond to a message unless the user's email
   address is in a "To", "Cc", "Bcc", "Resent-To", "Resent-Cc", or
   "Resent-Bcc" line of the original message.  Implementations are
   assumed to know the user's email address, but users may have
   additional addresses beyond the control of the local mail system.

   Users can supply additional mail addresses that are theirs with the
   ":addresses" argument, which takes a string-list listing additional
   addresses that a user might have.  These addresses are considered in
   addition to the addresses that the implementation knows.

3.6  Restricting Replies to Automated Processes and Mailing Lists

   Implementations MUST have a list of addresses that "vacation" MUST
   NOT send mail to.  However, the contents of this list are
   implementation defined.  The purpose of this list is to stop mail
   from going to addresses used by system daemons that would not care if
   the user is actually reading her mail.



Showalter & Freed       Expires October 15, 2005                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Sieve Vacation                   April 2005


   Implementations are encouraged, however, to include well-known
   addresses like "MAILER-DAEMON", "LISTSERV", "majordomo", and other
   addresses typically used only by automated systems.  Additionally,
   addresses ending in "-request" or beginning in "owner-", i.e.,
   reserved for mailing list software, are also suggested.

   Implementors may take guidance from [RFC2142], but should be careful.
   Some addresses, like "POSTMASTER", are generally actually managed by
   people, and people do care if the user is going to be unavailable.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT respond to any message with a header that
   begins with "List-".

   Implementations SHOULD NOT respond to any message that has an "Auto-
   submitted" header field with a value other than "no".  This header
   field is described in [RFC3834].

3.7  Interaction with Other Sieve Actions

   Vacation does not affect Sieve's implicit keep action.

   Vacation can only be executed once per script.  A script will fail if
   it attempts to execute two or more vacation actions.

   Implementations MUST NOT consider vacation used with discard, keep,
   fileinto, or redirect an error.  The vacation is incompatible with
   reject.

3.8  Examples

   Here is a simple use of vacation.

   require "vacation";
   vacation :days 23 :addresses ["tjs@example.edu",
                                 "ts4z@landru.example.edu"]
   "I'm away until October 19.
   If it's an emergency, call 911, I guess." ;

   By mingling vacation with other rules, users can do something more
   selective.

   require "vacation";
   if header :contains "from" "boss@example.edu" {
       redirect "pleeb@isp.example.org";
   } else {
       vacation "Sorry, I'm away, I'll read your
   message when I get around to it.";
   }

4.  Response Message Generation

   This section details the requirements for the generated response
   message.

   It is worth noting that the input message and arguments may be in
   UTF-8, and that implementations MUST deal with UTF-8 input, although
   implementations MAY transcode to other character sets as regional
   taste dictates.  When :mime is used the reason argument also contains
   MIME header information.  The headers must conform to MIME
   conventions; in particular, 8bit text is not allowed.
   Implementations SHOULD reject vacation :mime actions containing 8bit
   header material.

4.1  SMTP MAIL FROM address

   The SMTP MAIL FROM address of the message envelope SHOULD be set to
   <>.  NOTIFY=NEVER SHOULD also be set in the RCPT TO line during the
   SMTP transaction if the NOTARY SMTP extension [RFC3461]is available.

4.2  Date

   The Date field SHOULD be set to the date and time when the vacation
   response was generated.  Note that this may not be the same as the
   time the message was delivered to the user.

4.3  Subject

   Users can specify the Subject of the reply with the ":subject"
   parameter.  If the :subject parameter is not supplied, then the
   subject is generated as follows: The subject is set to the characters
   "Auto: " followed by the original subject.

4.4  From

   Unless explicitly overridden with a :from parameter, the From field
   SHOULD be set to the address of the owner of the Sieve script.

4.5  To

   The To field SHOULD be set to the address of the recipient of the
   response.

4.6  Auto-submitted

   An Auto-Submitted field with a value of "auto-replied" SHOULD be
   included in the message header of any vacation message sent.

Internet-Draft               Sieve Vacation                   April 2005


4.7  Message Body

   The body of the message is taken from the reason string in the
   vacation command.

4.8  In-Reply-To and References

   Replies MUST have the In-Reply-To field set to the Message-ID of the
   original message, and the References field SHOULD be updated with the
   Message-ID of the original message.

   If the original message lacks a Message-ID, an In-Reply-To need not
   be generated, and References need not be changed.

5.  Relationship to Recommendations for Automatic Responses to
    Electronic Mail

   The vacation extension implements a "Personal Responder" in the
   terminology defined in [RFC3834].  Care has been taken in this
   specification to comply with the recommendations [RFC3834] makes in
   regards to how personal responders should behave.

6.  Security Considerations

   It is critical that implementations correctly implement the behavior
   and rescriptions described throughout this document.  Replies MUST
   NOT be sent out in response to messages not sent directly to the
   user, and replies MUST NOT be sent out more often than the :days
   argument states unless the script changes.

   Security issues associated with mail auto-responders are fully
   discussed in the security consideration section of [RFC3834].

7.  IANA Considerations

   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the
   vacation Sieve extension specified in this document:
