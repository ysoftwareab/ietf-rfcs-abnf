Abstract 

   RFC4552 describes how to provide authentication/confidentiality to 
   OSPFv3 using IPsec. It specifies that same IPsec SA parameters be 
   configured for both inbound and outbound SAs to provide the "one to 
   many" security for multicast OSPFv3 communications over broadcast 
   links (e.g., Ethernet). Manual keying is specified as the mandatory 
   and default group key management solution. However, issues of 
   scalability and security exist with manual keying. It is better to 
   replace manual keying with automated group key management. This 
   document discusses the requirements on OSPFv3 automated group key 
   management, assuming that the centralized group key management 
   architecture introduced in [RFC4046] is used.

Internet-Draft    OSPFv3 Automated Group Keying Reqs         July 2007 
    

    
1. Introduction 

   OSPFv3 [RFC2740] relies on IPSec to provide integrity, authentication, 
   and/or confidentiality. RFC4552 describes how to provide 
   authentication/confidentiality to OSPFv3 using AH/ESP. In Section 7 
   of RFC4552, it is proved that best scalability and feasibility can be 
   achieved if the same parameters are used for both inbound and 
   outbound AH/ESP SAs to provide the "one to many" communication 
   security while running OSPFv3 over broadcast interfaces. It means 
   that group security model be used to protect OSPFv3 multicast 
   communications over broadcast network. 

   However, RFC4552 specifies Manual Keying [RFC4301] as the default 
   group key management method, which is neither scalable nor secure. 
   This document discusses replacing manual keying with automated keying 
   using either a "one to many" or "many to many" communication model. 
   It is based on the fact that several GKM protocols have been, or 
   being, standardized by MSEC working group [RFC3547] [RFC3830] 
   [RFC4535] [GKDP], which makes it feasible to provide automated group 
   key management for OSPFv3 using GKM protocols. 

   Meanwhile, [I-D: draft-ietf-msec-ipsec-extensions] describes 
   multicast extensions to IPsec, which makes it feasible to provide 
   group security to OSPFv3 using standard multicast IPsec.  

   This document describes the requirements on OSPFv3 automated group 
   key management. It is assumed that the centralized group security 
   architecture [RFC3740] and group key management architecture [RFC4046] 
   would be used, where group SAs are centrally managed on separate key 
   server(s). And one of MSEC GKM protocols will be chosen as the group 
   keying protocols. Use of group key agreement techniques, for example, 
   Cliques [CLIQUES], is out of consideration. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 

   Group Key Management (GKM) Protocol 

       A group key management protocol used by a GCKS to distribute 
       IPsec Security Association policy and keying material. A GKM 
       protocol is used when a group of IPsec devices require the same 
       SAs. For example, when an IPsec SA describes an IP multicast 
       destination, the sender and all receivers MUST have the group SA.

   Group Controller Key Server (GCKS) 

       A Group Key Management (GKM) protocol server that manages IPsec 
       state for a group. A GCKS authenticates and provides the IPsec SA 
       policy and keying material to GKM group members. 

       GC and KS may also be acted by different entities. GC is 
       responsible defining and distributing group policy and 
       authorization, while KS providing group keying service to a 
       specific group. 

   Group Member 

       An IPsec device that belongs to a group. A Group Member is 
       authorized to be a Group Speaker and/or a Group Receiver. 

   Group Security Association (Group SA/GSA) 

       A collection of IPsec Security Associations (SAs) and GKM SAs 
       necessary for a Group Member to receive key updates. A GSA 
       describes the working policy for a group. Refer to RFC 4046 
       [RFC4046] for additional information. 

   State Synchronization (SS) 

       A generalization of OSPFv3 communications that occur after two 
       routers discover each other. It includes neighbor discovering, 
       exchanging DDs and LSAs, etc.  

3. General Requirements 

   Requirements discussed in this section are considered general to all 
   keying solutions. 

3.1. Authentication and Authorization of Routers 

   When a router uses a GKM protocol to contact a GCKS, the GCKS 
   authenticates the router and verifies that the router is authorized 
   to participate in the group. Both steps are necessary in order for 
   the Group SA to ensure that the Group SA is kept private to OSPF 
   routers that are allowed to participate in OSPF. Both authentication 
   and authorization MUST be enforced before a Group SA is distributed 
   to a router.

3.2. Secure Distribution of Group SA  

   Eavesdroppers are not able to access the group keys by intercepting 
   the group SA distribution packets. All existing GKM protocols can 
   meet this requirement. 

3.3. Storing Capability of Keys, Authorizations, and Policies 

   It is expected that a network start up autonomously without a 
   provisioning step after rebooting. To actualize that target, routers 
   SHOULD to be able to store group security context information, such 
   as group policy, authorization, neighbor list, and GSA, etc., in 
   their storages (i.e., flash, hard disk). After rebooting, if this 
   policy is stored a router quickly resumes its group security context 
   to the same state as that of before rebooting and keeps in 
   synchronization with its neighbors. After every router has done that, 
   the OSPF SS process can be securely re-done in the network. Fast 
   routes convergence is assured during this process. 

   Group security context may change during rebooting. In such cases, 
   synchronization of group security context among routers can not be 
   achieved just by caching and resuming mechanisms. Other measures are 
   needed. Specific requirements on this topic will be discussed case by 
   case in the following sections. 

4. GCKS Deployment Example and its Specific Requirements 

   MSEC GKM protocols, such as GSAKMP and GDOI, are based on a 
   client/server model. This means these protocols rely on reachability 
   between clients and servers for the clients to obtain the group SA 
   from the server. In this case, the GKM is providing protection for 
   OSPF, which is an essential component in providing reachability 
   between the clients and servers. Hence, the client/server model 
   breaks down in this situation. 

   To overcome this problem, the group SA must be locally available to 
   each group member (each OSPFv3 router). Possible solutions to this 
   circular dependency and their specific requirements are presented in 
   this section.  

   The expected network where OSPFv3 multicast communications occur and 
   group SA is assumed to be deployed is like the network N1 shown in 
   Fig.1. This network is used in this memo to derive the specific 
   requirements.

          Figure 1 : The scenario used to derive the requirements 

   N1 is a broadcast network, where GSA is used to protect the OSPFv3 
   multicast communications among RT1~RT5. Group members attached to N1, 
   including RT1~RT5, get the group SA from GCKS. For convenience of 
   this example, broadcast interfaces attached to N1 are numbered as #1, 
   which each router recognizes is part of a single group. 

   Types of networks N2~N6 are not fixed. They MAY be either broadcast, 
   P2MP, or NBMA. It is assumed that a GSA plays locally on a multicast 
   network. Whether N2~N6 will share the same GSA with N1 is out the 
   scope of this memo even if they are broadcast type either. 

4.1. Decentralized GCKSs 

   In this deployment example, there will be a GCKS for each multicast 
   network. The GCKS may be either a physical server or a logical one 
   that is acted by an OSPFv3 router, e.g., one router from RT1~RT5 is 
   selected as N1's GCKS. The GCKS and group members are located in the 
   same network, and share a GSA that is used only on that network. (If 
   a group member is attached to multiple networks, then it will install 
   a unique GSA for each network.) The GCKS may deliver either a single 
   SA used by each group member (a "many to many" SA) or deliver an 
   individual SA used by a unique sender (several "one to many" SAs). 
   GSA messages can be distributed from GCKS to group members within one 
   hop. Group members can download the GSA from their GCKS before they 
   establish their routes. It means no routes need to be pre-available

   before the OSPFv3 router members run the GKM protocol to download GSA 
   from their GCKS. This solution can solve the contradiction mentioned 
   above. It applies to both small and large ASs.  

   Requirements introduced by this solution are illustrated as follows. 

4.1.1. Single Point of GCKS Failure 

   This is a requirement common to all client/server 
   protocols/applications. The GCKS MAY be out of service because of 
   attacks, accidents, reboots, etc. Measures MUST be prepared to 
   provide continuous keying service in case of single point of GCKS 
   failure. 

4.1.2. GCKS Selecting/Switchover Issue 

   To deal with the problem of single point of GCKS failure, at least 2 
   GCKSs need to be deployed in each multicast network. If GCKSs are 
   acted by the routers, switchover mechanisms are necessary to the GKM 
   protocol to provide continuous keying service when the running GCKS 
   becomes out of service and its service needs to be transferred to the 
   backup GCKS. 

   Another requirement is GCKS selecting mechanism, which is very like 
   OSPF DR/BDR selecting mechanism. It is necessary in the case of a 
   logical GCKS. Routers MUST be able to select their master/backup GCKS 
   when they start up. 

4.1.3. Authorization and Authentication of GCKS 

   When routers begin to select their GCKS and backup GCKS, they need to 
   authenticate the candidates and verify that the selected GCKSs are 
   authorized to act as the GCKSs in the group. Both steps are necessary 
   in order to ensure that attackers can not become the GCKS by cheating 
   others. Both authentication and authorization MUST be enforced during 
   a GCKS selecting process. 

4.1.4. New Joiner Issue 

   New router may join an existing network. It should be able to 
   automatically discover the local GCKS and contact it to get current 
   GSA so it can securely perform OSPF SS process with its neighbors.  

   However, dynamic changes of group membership may not be pre-known. 
   Thus, the list of authorized routers may not be pre-installed on each 
   GCKS. GCKS must be able to deal with such dynamic changes of 
   authorizations. If a new router registers with it, GCKS MUST be able

Internet-Draft    OSPFv3 Automated Group Keying Reqs         July 2007 
    

   to authenticate the new one and verify whether it is authorized to 
   access the GSA even if the new router is not in the GCKS's authorized 
   routers list. 

4.2. Decentralized KSs, Centralized GC 

   In this solution, KS and GC are separate roles. KS is logical and is 
   deployed per network; while GC is centrally deployed. This solution 
   allows for a centralized group management, but allows the KSs to act 
   autonomously. The GC is responsible for defining the group policy and 
   authorization, and pushing them to each KS. Each key server then 
   distributes a GSA conforming to the group policy. As in the 
   Decentralized GCKS case, each key server distributes a GSA that is 
   used only on a single network and SAs may be either have a scope of 
   "many to many" or "one to many". 

   Requirements in section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 apply. New requirements 
   introduced by this solution are illustrated as follows. 

4.2.1. Bootstrapping Issue 

   When the network originally starts up, there are no routes, and 
   candidate KS/backup KS routers do not have the authorization 
   information of group membership. After the KS/backup KS are selected, 
   they will not be able to provide the keying service because they 
   don't know the information of authorization and authentication of 
   routers. Measure MUST be provided to handle such issue.  

4.2.2. New Joiner Issue 

   GC is responsible for determining list of authorized routers. 
   Measures must be provided to keep authorization information in 
   synchronization between GC and KS. For example, if a new router is 
   authorized by GC to join the network, KS must be able to authenticate 
   it and verify it is an authorized one even if it does not know the 
   new router and cannot contact with the GC. 

4.2.3. Authorization and Authentication of KS 

   When routers begin to select their master/backup KSs, they must be 
   able to authenticate the candidates and verify that the selected KSs 
   are authorized to play such roles. Both steps of authentication and 
   authorization check are necessary in order to ensure that attackers 
   can not become the KS by cheating others. Both authentication and 
   authorization MUST be enforced during a KS selecting process.

Internet-Draft    OSPFv3 Automated Group Keying Reqs         July 2007 
    

4.3. Decentralized Delegates, Centralized GCKS 

   In this solution, there is a delegate in each OSPFv3 multicast 
   network. GSA messages are created by the centralized GCKS which may 
   serve multiple OSPFv3 networks at the same time. A delegate is 
   responsible for receiving GSA messages from the GCKS and re-
   distributing them to its local group members. A delegate can be 
   either physical or logical. 

   Requirements introduced by this solution are as follows. 

4.3.1. Bootstrapping Issue 

   When neighboring routers initially start, e.g., routers attached to 
   N1, they have no routes to the key server and so, can not download 
   the GSA from the centralized GCKS. Security measures MUST be provided 
   to protect the initial communications among OSPFv3 routers before 
   their adjacencies are established and routes are calculated out. 

4.3.2. New Joiner Issue 

   When a new router joins, it will perform OSPF SS process with its 
   neighbors, and then calculate its routes. Before routes are 
   calculated out, the new coming router cannot contact the remote GCKS 
   to get current GSA. Measures MUST be provided to let the new joining 
   router get current GSA from GCKS so that it can securely communicate 
   with its neighboring routers. 

   Another problem is that routers may reboot singly. A rebooting router 
   needs to re-join the network after it restarts. However, during the 
   rebooting process, GSA may be updated by the GCKS and distributed to 
   other running routers. Therefore, after a router restarts and resumes 
   the GSA from its storage (e.g., flash), it may find its local GSA is 
   out of synchronization with its neighbors and thus, cannot establish 
   relationship with neighboring routers before it gets the latest GSA. 
   Measures must be provided to let rebooting routers make sure whether 
   its local GSA is out of synchronization with its neighbors and, if 
   yes, be able to get the updated GSA to keep its GSA in 
   synchronization with its neighbors. 

4.3.3. Single Point of Delegate Failure 

   The delegate may crash or reboot. In such cases, the GSA 
   redistribution service will be not available. Measures MUST be 
   prepared to assure continuous GSA relaying service.

Internet-Draft    OSPFv3 Automated Group Keying Reqs         July 2007 
    

4.3.4. Delegate Selecting/Switchover Issue 

   To deal with the single point of delegate failure, at least 2 
   delegates must be deployed on every network. In the case of logical 
   delegates, delegate selecting mechanism is required for the GKM 
   protocols so routers can autonomously elect their local master/backup 
   delegates of their local network. 

   Switchover mechanism is needed to ensure that the backup delegate can 
   immediately supersede the master delegate in case that the later one 
   is out of service. 

4.3.5. Authorization and Authentication of Delegate 

   In the delegates selecting process, routers need to authenticate the 
   candidates and verify that the selected delegates are authorized to 
   play such roles. Both steps of authenticating and authorization 
   checking are necessary in order to ensure that an attacker can not 
   become the delegate by cheating others.  

5. Security Considerations 

   This document lists requirements for automated group keying of OSPFv3. 
   Several possible solutions and their specific requirements are 
   discussed. This section will discuss the security risk of the
