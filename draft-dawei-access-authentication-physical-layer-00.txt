1.  Introduction

   The classical device-authentication methods includes MAC address,
   pre-shared key.  However, the MAC address is easy to be imitated.
   Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) is a physical layer inherent
   characteristic for a device.  Utilizing the RFF for terminal access
   control, it is possible to realize identity authentication by
   received waveforms.

   Some RFF features can be used for classification and identification.
   Different kinds of RFF extraction algorithms would generate features
   with different
   expressions[I-D.linning-authentication-physical-layer].  Hybrid

   features would be used to improve identification relability in
   practical use.So The wireless access control system based on RFF must
   support different kinds of fingerprint expressions and be compatible
   with the existing authentication framework.  Besides uniforming the
   RFF expressions could make the framework suitable for a variety of
   IoT devices.  As a new authentication key, RF fingerprint is
   incorporated into the access control system.  This requires the
   unified expression format, coding, control signal frame, status code
   and other specifications of fingerprint.

3.  RF Fingerprint Access Control Framework

   RF fingerprint access control framework uses RF fingerprint as the
   authentication token for access.  It is different from the
   traditional authentication mode which depends on the pair of MAC
   address and secure key.  It substitutes the secure key with RF
   fingerprint.  When a new network device requests access, if its MAC
   address is illegal, the access framework will directly reject it.  If
   its MAC address is legal, it will then be judged whether its
   fingerprint matches its MAC address.  If not, it will be considered

   as an illegal and disguised device with a fake MAC address.


   Limited to the weak computing ability of IoT edge devices and the
   requirement of RF fingerprint extraction algorithm, the access
   control framework adopts a three-party authentication model.  It
   includes the claimant, relying party, the verifier, and the
   relationships among them is shown in Figure 1.  The claimant refers
   to the IoT device requesting access to the network.  The relying
   party refers to the nodes which is responsible for access control in
   the IoT network, such as the central node device or the lower
   computer of the IP interface.  The verifier refers to a trusted third
   party for RF fingerprint extraction and identification.  The verifier
   and the relying party can be the same entity.

   Figure 2 shows the network architecture after deploying the network
   model of Figure 1.  The RF fingerprint wireless access control system
   mainly includes physical layer equipment access gateways,
   authentication servers, proxy servers, signal collectors, etc.  The
   relying party is an entrance gateway of the IP network, or the trust
   center which is a special device in an IoT network.  Therefore, the
   communication between the relying party and the proxy server requires
   an appropriate interface.  The black and white list of the system is
   stored in the authentication server.

                     Figure 2: RFF Access Control Model

   Detailed access process is described as follows.  When a new device
   applies to join a network, it should firstly establish a connection
   to parent node.  The IP address of the new device is preseted or
   assigned by its parent node before authenticattion.  After the
   preliminary connection is established, the parent node sends an
   authentication request, which carries the MAC address of the new
   device, to the relying party.  The relying party sends an
   authentication request to the proxy server, and the proxy server uses
   the analog signals received from the new device to extract.  Then the
   proxy server sends a request frame containing the fingerprint to the
   authentication server.

   The signal collector usually keeps monitoring the entire system.
   Since the wireless network device adopts the CSMA/CD strategy for
   sending signals, the request frame for joining a network would be
   captured by the signal collector in real time.  Sampling data is
   already stored in the proxy server before the relying party requests
   authentication.  If the proxy server does not capture the claimant's
   connection request signal, it will return a status code, ?no

   fingerprint collected?, to the relying party.  Therefore, there are
   three kinds of status code for authentication: legal, illegal and no
   fingerprint collected.

   The relying party executes access control according to the
   authentication status code, such that:

   *  Legal

         Assign communication keys to allow new nodes to join the
         network.

   *  Illegal

         Do not assign keys to the new node and send a control frame to
         block the illegal device.

   *  No Fingerprint Collected

         Send the control frame to ask the new node to resubmit the
         authentication request.

4.  Specification of Basic Functions of Access Control Framework

   The certification service of the verifier shall be independent and
   impartial, and its authentication results should help to establish a
   trust relationship between the application system and new IoT device.

   The IoT device application layer protocol should provide specific
   signaling and functional processes for access control framework.
   Specifically:

   *  The connection process between the new device and its parent node
      should be split into two parts: connection establishment and
      authentication.  After the connection is established, the new
      device uses its MAC address to request authentication.  The
      communication key can only be obtained after the judgment is
      legal.

   *  Authentication status code should contain at least 3 types: legal,
      illegal, no fingerprint collected.

   *  The gateway or trust center should be able to respond to the
      authentication result from the proxy server when it does not
      actively apply a connection request.  That is, the verifier can
      check the legitimacy of the devices in the network at any time.

Internet-Draft                 RFF ACCESS                  February 2022


   The verifier needs to be in a secure and trusted environment.  For
   example, proxy servers, authentication servers, and signal collectors
   are deployed in a security intranet.

   All communication interfaces in the framework should be reliable.

   The relying party and the authenticating party should adopt encrypted
   communication mode, using an independent, preset session key.

   The access authentication framework does not specify the fingerprint
   extraction method and authentication mechanism, and has nothing to do
   with the signal protocol type of the IoT devices.  But all kinds of
   fingerprints should have a unified expression form.

5.  Specification of Fingerprint Expression

5.1.  Common RF Fingerprint Types

   RF fingerprints mainly include frequency offset, phase offset, power
   spectral density, adaptive filter coefficients, differential
   constellation, etc.  They could be mainly divided into two types:
   graphics and numerical values, both of which can be transformed into
   a one-dimensional vector.  According to the type of IoT device and
   the type of communication protocol, the identification algorithm
   adopts single or multiple RFF features.  Fingerprint identification
   algorithm classifies and identifies the devices through the
   differences among feature vectors.  Features of one device is stable
   and similar in different time.  Differences of features among
   different devices are obvious and easy to classify.

5.2.  Specification of Expression Format

   RF fingerprint is expressed as a one-dimensional vector including no
   more than 30 elements.  If it exceeds 30 elements, feature dimension
   reduction is required.  For features that cannot be reduced to less
   than 30 elements, feature segmentation and packet transmission shall
   be carried out.

   The one-dimensional RFF feature vector shall fully reflect the
   fingerprint characteristics of the devices.  The feature vector of
   the same device shall remain relatively stable, while the feature
   vectors of different devices shall maintain distinguishable
   differences.

5.3.  Specification of Fingerprint Compression Coding

   The original fingerprint vector dimension is less than 30 dimensions,
   and the data storage form is floating point or integer.  The
   compression coding process is presented as follows:

   *  Normalize the fingerprint vector , scale the numerical value in (-
      1,1).

   *  For each one-dimensional vector, convert it to binary decimal and
      24 significant digits are reserved.  The first bit is the sign
      bit.  The sign bit 0 indicates that the value is positive and 1
      indicates that the value is negative.

   *  The 64 symbols 48 ~ 90 and 97 ~ 117 in the ASCII code table are
      used as the mapping table.  The 24 bit binary is grouped into 4
      groups according to 6 bits.  Convert every 6-bit binary decimal to
      1-bit 64 decimal.  Then map the 64-decimal symbol to an ASCII
      symbol according to the index.  Thus, each one-dimensional data
      coding dimension is decoded by 4 ASCII symbols.

   *  Convert all dimensions of all vectors to ASCII symbols and splice
      them into strings.  The string length is less than or equal to 120
      characteristics.  This string is the fingerprint formal
      expression.

6.  Specification of Control Message in Framework

   The control message is compatible with radius protocol, in which
   attributes, functions and maximum length are in accordance with
   radius protocol.

   The control message is compatible with RADIUS protocolRFC 2865
   [RFC2865], in which attributes, functions and maximum length are in
   accordance with radius protocol.

6.1.  RFF Access Message Format

   The message format shall at least contain five fields: frame type,
   identifier, frame length, authenticator and attribute.  The detailed
   description is shown in Figure 3.

   This section will address only security considerations associated
   with the use of RF fingerprint access control framework.  Encrypted
   communication is required when the access control message is
   transmitted between the IoT trust center and the third-party server.
   If the third party is not credible, the access system loses
   credibility.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the relying
   party and the verifier are in a secure and trusted environment.
