1.  Introduction

   Many authenticated key exchange protocols allow for authentication
   using uncertified, or "raw", public keys.  Usually these
   specifications-- e.g.  [RFC7250] for TLS and [RFC7670] for IKEv2--
   assume keys are exchanged in some out-of-band mechanism.

   [RFC7250] further states that "the main security challenge [to using
   'raw' public keys] is how to associate the public key with a specific
   entity.  Without a secure binding between identifier and key, the
   protocol will be vulnerable to man-in-the- middle attacks."

   The Public Key Exchange (PKEX) is designed to fill that gap: it
   establishs a secure binding between exchanged public keys and
   identifiers, it provides proof-of-possession of the exchanged public
   keys to each peer, and it enables the establishment of trust in
   public keys that can subsequently be used to faccilitate
   authentication in other authentication and key exchange protocols.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Notation

   This memo describes a cryptographic exchange using sets of elements
   called groups.  Groups can be either traditional finite field or can
   be based on elliptic curves.  The public keys exchanged by PKEX are
   elements in a group.  Elements in groups are denoted in upper-case
   and scalar values are denoted with lower-case.  The generator of the
   group is G.

   When both the initator and responder use a similar, but unique, datum
   it is denoted by appending an "i" for initiator or "r" for responder,
   e.g. if each side needs an element C then the initiator's is Ci and
   the responder's is Cr.

   During the exchange, one side will generate data and the other side
   will attempt to reconstruct it.  The reconstructed data is "primed".
   That is, if the initiator generates C then when responder tries to
   reconstruct it, the responder will refer to it as C'.  Data that is
   directly sent and received is not primed.

   The following notation is used in this memo:

   C = A + B
       The "group operation" on two elements, A and B, that produces a
       third element, C.  For finite field cryptography this is the
       modular multiplication, for elliptic curve cryptography this is
       point addition.

   C = a * B
       This denotes repeated application of the group operation to B--
       i.e.  B + B-- (a - 1) times.

   a = H(b)
       A cryptographic hash function that takes data b of indeterminate
       length and returns a fixed sized digest a.

   a = F(B)
       A mapping function that takes an element and returns a scalar.
       For elliptic curve cryptography, F() returns the x-coordinate of
       the point B.  For finite field cryptography, F() is the identity
       function.

   a = KDF-b(c, d)
       A key derivation function that derives an output key a of length
       b from an input key c and context d.

   c = a | b
       Concatentation of data a with data b producing c.

   {a}b
       Authenticated-encryption of data a with key b.

2.  Properties

   Subversion of PKEX involves an adversary being able to insert its own
   public key into the exchange without the exchange failing, resulting
   in one of the parties to the exchange believing the adversary's
   public key actually belongs to the protocol peer.

   PKEX has the following properties:

   o  An adversary is unable to subvert the exchange without knowing the
      password.

   o  An adversary is unable to discover the password through passive
      attack.

   o  The only information exposed by an active attack is whether a
      single guess of the password is correct or not.

   o  Proof-of-possession of the private key is provided.

   o  At the end of the protocol, either trust is established in the
      peer's public key and the public key is bound to the peer's
      identity, or the exchange fails.

3.  Assumptions

   Due to the nature of the exchange, only DSA ([DSS]) and ECDSA
   ([X9.62]) keys can be exchanged with PKEX.

   PKEX requires fixed elements that are unique to the particular role
   in the protocol, an initiator-specific element and a responder-
   specific element.  They need not be secret.  It is assumed that both
   parties know the role-specific elements for the particular group in
   which their key pairs were derived.  This memo does not proscribe any
   way to generate these role-specific elements but the "Hunting and
   Pecking" technique of [RFC7664] could be used with a slight
   variation.  Instead of inputting a password and generating a secret
   element, a common string such as "PKEX Initiator Element" can be used
   to generate a public element.  For elliptic curve cryptography, the
   technique of "hashing into an elliptic curve" from [hash2ec] could be
   used, again with a common string, to produce role-specific elements.

   The authenticated-encryption algorithm provides deterministic "key
   wrapping".  To achieve this the AE scheme used in PKEX is [RFC5297].

Internet-Draft             Public Key Exchange              October 2016


   The KDF provides for the generation of a cryptographically strong
   secret key from an "imperfect" source of randomness.  To achieve this
   the KDF used in PKEX is the unsalted version of [RFC5869].

   The following assumptions are made on PKEX:

   o  Only the peers involved in the exchange know the password.

   o  The peers' public keys are from the same group.

   o  The discrete logarithms of the public role-specific elements are
      unknown, and determining them is computationally infeasible.

4.  Cryptographic Primitives

   HKDF requires an underlying hash function and AES-SIV requires a key
   length.  To provide for consistent security the hash algorithm and
   key length depend on the group chosen to use with PKEX.

   For ECC, the hash algorithm and key length depends on the size of the
   prime defining the curve, p:

   o  SHA-256 and 256 bits: when len(p) <= 256

   o  SHA-384 and 384 bits: when 256 < len(p) <= 384

   o  SHA-512 and 512 bits: when 384 < len(p)

   For FFC, the hash algorithm depends on the prime, p, defining the
   finite field:

   o  SHA-256 and 256 bits: when len(p) <= 2048

   o  SHA-384 and 384 bits: when 2048 < len(p) <= 3072

   o  SHA-512 and 512 bits: when 3072 < len(p)

5.  Protocol Definition

   PKEX is a balanced PAKE.  The identical version of the password is
   used by both parties.

   PKEX consists of two phases: exchange and commit/reveal.  It is
   described using the popular protocol participants, Alice (an
   initiator of PKEX), and Bob (a responder of PKEX).

   We denote Alice's role-specific element a Pi and Bob's as Pr.  The
   password is pw.  For simplicity, Alice's identity is "Alice" and

Internet-Draft             Public Key Exchange              October 2016


   Bob's identity is "Bob".  Alice's public key she wants to share with
   Bob is A and her private key is a, while Bob's public key he wants to
   share with Alice is B and his private key is b.

5.1.  Exchange Phase

   The Exchange phase is essentially the SPAKE2 key exchange.  The peers
   derive ephemeral public keys, encrypt, and exchange them.  Each party
   hashes a concatentation of his or her identity and the password and
   operates on the role-specific element to obtain a secret encrypting
   element.  The group operation is then performed with the ephemeral
   key and the secret encrypting element to produce an encrypted
   ephmeral key.

         Alice:                           Bob:
         ------                           ----
     x, X = x*G                         y, Y = y*G
     Qi = H(Alice|pw)*Pi                Qr = H(Bob|pw)*Pr
     M = X + Qa
                           M ------>
                                        Qi = H(Alice|pw)*Pi
                                        X' = M - Qi
                                        N = Y + Qr
                           <------ N
     Qr = H(Bob|pw)*Pr
     Y' = N - Qr

   Both M and N MUST be verified to be valid elements in the selected
   group.  If either one is not valid the protocol fails.

   At this point in time the peers have exchanged ephemeral elements
   that will be unknown except by someone with knowledge of the
   password.  Given our assumptions that means only Alice and Bob can
   know the elements X and Y.

   The secret encrypting elements are irretrievably deleted at this
   point.

5.2.  Commit/Reveal Phase

   In the Commit/Reveal phase the peers commit to the particular public
   key they wish to exchange and then reveal it to the peer.

                                    v = HMAC(kb, F(Y) | F(X') |
                                             F(B) | Bob | 1)

                            <------ {B, v}z

     if (SIV-decrypt returns fail) fail
     if (B not valid element) fail
     kb' = KDF-n(F(x*B'), F(N) | F(M) |
               F(B') | F(X) | pw)
     v' = HMAC(kb', F(Y') | F(X) |
               F(B') | Bob | 1)
     if (v'!= v) fail

   where 0 and 1 are single octets of the value zero and one,
   respectively, n is the key length from Section 4, and both the KDF
   and HMAC use the hash algorithm from Section 4.

   If the parties didn't fail they have each other's public key,
   knowledge that the peer possesses the corresponding private key, and
   trust that the public key belongs to the peer's stated identity.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo could create a registry of the fixed public elements for a
   nice cross section of popular groups.  Or not.  If it ends up doing
   so there will be IANA Considerations here, otherwise there won't be.

Internet-Draft             Public Key Exchange              October 2016


7.  Security Considerations

   The encrypted shares exchanged in the Exchange phase MUST be
   ephemeral.  Reuse of these keys, even with a different password,
   voids the security of the exchange.

   The discrete logaritm of the fixed public elements MUST not be known.
   Knowledge of either of these values voids the security of the
   exchange.

   The public keys exchanged in PKEX are never disclosed to an attacker,
   either passive or active.  While they are, as the name implies,
   public, PKEX provides for secrecy of the exchanged keys for any
   protocol that might need such a capability.

   PKEX has forward secrecy in the sense that exposure of the password
   used in a previous run of the protocol will not affect the security
   of that run.

   There is no proof of security of PKEX at this time but the Exchange
   phase is SPAKE2 and the security proof for that protocol can be used
   to help prove the security of PKEX.
