Sec-Token-Binding = "Sec-Token-Binding" ":" [CFWS] EncodedTokenBindingMessage

   The EncodedTokenBindingMessage is a web-safe Base64-encoding of the
   TokenBindingMessage as defined in the TokenBindingProtocol [TBPROTO].

   The TokenBindingMessage MUST contain a TokenBinding with
   TokenBindingType provided_token_binding, which MUST be signed with
   the Token Binding key used by the client for connections between
   itself and the server that the HTTP request is sent to (clients use
   different Token Binding keys for different servers).  The Token
   Binding ID established by this TokenBinding is called a _Provided
   Token Binding ID_

   In HTTP/2, the client SHOULD use Header Compression
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-compression] to avoid the overhead of
   repeating the same header in subsequent HTTP requests.

Include-Referer-Token-Binding-ID = "Include-Referer-Token-Binding-ID" ":"
                                     [CFWS] %x74.72.75.65 ; "true", case-sensitive

   Including this response header signals to the client that it should
   reveal, to the Token Provider, the Token Binding ID used between
   itself and the Token Consumer.  In the absence of this response
   header, the client will not disclose any information about the Token
   Binding used between the client and the Token Consumer to the Token
   Provider.

   When a client receives this header, it should take the TokenBindingID
   of the provided TokenBinding from the referrer and create a referred
   TokenBinding with it to include in the TokenBindingMessage on the
   redirect request.  In other words, the Token Binding message in the
   redirect request to the Token Provider includes one provided binding
   and one referred binding, the latter constructed from the binding
   between the client and the Token Consumer.

   If the Include-Referer-Token-Binding-ID header is received in
   response to a request that did not include the Token-Binding header,
   the client MUST ignore the Include-Referer-Token-Binding-ID header.

   This header has only meaning if the HTTP status code is 301, 302,
   303, 307 or 308, and MUST be ignored by the client for any other
   status codes.  If the client supports the Token Binding Protocol, and
   has negotiated the Token Binding Protocol with both the Token
   Consumer and the Token Provider, it already sends the following
   header to the Token Provider with each HTTP request (see above):


    Sec-Token-Binding: EncodedTokenBindingMessage

   The TokenBindingMessage SHOULD contain a TokenBinding with
   TokenBindingType referred_token_binding.  If included, this
   TokenBinding MUST be signed with the Token Binding key used by the
   client for connections between itself and the Token Consumer (more
   specifically, the web origin that issued the Include-Referer-Token-
   Binding-ID response header).  The Token Binding ID established by
   this TokenBinding is called a _Referred Token Binding ID_.

   As described above, the TokenBindingMessage MUST additionally contain
   a Provided Token Binding ID, i.e., a TokenBinding structure with
   TokenBindingType provided_token_binding, which MUST be signed with
   the Token Binding key used by the client for connections between
   itself and the Token Privider (more specifically, the web origin that
   the token request sent to).
