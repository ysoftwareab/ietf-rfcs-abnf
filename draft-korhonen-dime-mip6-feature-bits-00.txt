Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6 Feature Vector Bits       October 2008


1.  Introduction

   During the Mobile IPv6 [3] Split Scenario bootstrapping [4] the
   Mobile IPv6 Home Agent (HA) and the Authentication, Authorization,
   and Accounting (AAA) server MAY exchange a set of capabilities as
   defined in [5].  This document defines additional capability flag
   bits that are used to authorize per Mobile Node (MN) route
   optimization, Multiple Care-of Address (MCoA) [6] and user plane
   traffic encryption support.  Furthermore, this document also defines
   a capability flag bit of indicating whether the HA is authorized to
   act as a stand alone IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway for
   remote VPN clients.

   These new capability flag bits allow Mobility Service Provider (MSP)
   to control the supported services on the HA.  Additionally, the HA
   SHOULD inform the MN whether the route optimization, the use of MCoA
   or the user plane encryption is allowed.  This allows the MN to learn
   the MSP service policies in a clean way.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Flag definitions for the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP is defined in [2].  This document defines
   new additional capability bits for signaling the support of Mobile
   IPv6 route optimization and the support of Multiple Care-of
   Addresses.  These new capability bits are intended to be used between
   the HA and the AAA server during the Mobile IPv6 Split Scenario
   bootstrapping Diameter interactions [5].  However, the defined flag
   bits MAY also be used in other scenarios and deployments outside the
   Mobile IPv6 Split Scenario.  In addition to the capability flag bits
   this document also defines corresponding Mobile IPv6 Binding
   Acknowledgement Status Codes.

3.1.  Route Optimization Support

   Route optimization support is indicated by using the RO_SUPPORTED
   (value 0x0000000200000000) capability flag bit.  When the HA sets
   this bit, it indicates support for the route optimization.  If this
   bit is unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server
   does not authorize route optimization for the MN.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6 Feature Vector Bits       October 2008


   In a case the HA or the AAA server cannot authorize the use of route
   optimization then the HA SHOULD send a Binding Acknowledgement with a
   Status Code set to ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION (status code
   TBD).  This Status Code indicates that the binding registration
   succeeded but the HA will fail all possible subsequent route
   optimization attempts because of subscription or operator policy.

3.2.  Multiple Care-of Addresses Support

   Multiple Care-of Addresses (MCoA) [6] support is indicated by using
   the MCOA_SUPPORTED (value 0x0000001000000000) capability flag bit.
   When the HA sets this bit, it indicates support for the MCoA.  If
   this bit is unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA
   server does not authorize the use of MCoA for the MN.

   In a case the HA or the AAA server cannot authorize the use of the
   MCoA then the HA SHOULD send a Binding Acknowledgement with a Status
   Code set to ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_MCOA (status code TBD).  This Status Code
   indicates that the binding registration succeeded but the HA will
   fail all possible subsequent attempts to use MCoA because of
   subscription or operator policy.

3.3.  User Traffic Encryption Support

   User plane traffic encryption support is indicated by using the
   USER_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION (value 0x0000000400000000) capability flag
   bit.  When the HA sets this bit, it indicates support for the user
   plane traffic encryption between the MN and the HA.  If this bit is
   unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server does
   not authorize user plane traffic encryption because of subscription
   or operator policy.

   In the case the AAA server cannot authorize the use of user plane
   traffic encryption then the HA SHOULD send a Binding Acknowledgement
   with a Status Code set to ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION (status
   code TBD).  This Status Code indicates that the binding registration
   succeeded but the HA will silently discard all encrypted user plane
   packets sent by the MN to the HA.

3.4.  VPN Gateway Mode Support

   The HA MAY act as a IPsec VPN gateway for the user and the support is
   indicated by the VPN_GW_MODE (value 0x0000000800000000) capability
   flag bit.  When the HA sets this bit, it indicates support for acting
   as a standalone IPsec VPN gateway.  If this bit is unset in the
   returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the AAA server does not authorize
   the HA to act as a standalone IPsec VPN gateway for the MN because of
   subscription or operator policy.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

4.1.  Capability Flag Bits

   This specification defines new values to the "Mobility Capability"
   registry (see [2]) for use with the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP:

   Token                            | Value                | Description
   ---------------------------------+----------------------+------------
   RO_SUPPORTED                     | 0x0000000200000000   | RFC TBD
   USER_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION          | 0x0000000400000000   | RFC TBD
   VPN_GW_MODE                      | 0x0000000800000000   | RFC TBD
   MCOA_SUPPORTED                   | 0x0000001000000000   | RFC TBD

4.2.  Mobile IPv6 Status Codes

   This specification defines new Mobile IPv6 [3] Status Code values.
   The Status Code must be allocated from the range 0-127:

   Status Code                             | Value         | Description
   ----------------------------------------+---------------+------------
   ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION      | is set to TBD | RFC TBD
   ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_MCOA                    | is set to TBD | RFC TBD
   ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION      | is set to TBD | RFC TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no additional security consideration to those
   already described for the Mobile IPv6 Integrated Scenario Diameter
   interactions [2] and Mobile IPv6 Split Scenario Diameter interactions
   [5].
