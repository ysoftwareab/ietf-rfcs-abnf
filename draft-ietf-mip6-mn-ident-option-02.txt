Internet-Draft    Mobile Node Identifier Option for Mobile IPv6
February 2005


1.  Introduction

   The base specification of Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] identifies mobility
   entities using an IPv6 address.  It is essential to have a mechanism
   wherein mobility entities can be identified using other identifiers
   (for example, a network access identifier (NAI) [RFC_2486bis],
   International Mobile Station Identifier (IMSI), an application/
   deployment specific opaque identifier etc).

   The capability to identify a mobility entity via identifiers other
   than the IPv6 address can be leveraged for performing various
   functions, eg.

   o  authentication and authorization using an existing AAA
      (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) infrastructure or
      via an HLR/AuC (Home Location Register/Authentication Center),

   o  dynamic allocation of a mobility anchor point,

   o  dynamic allocation of a home address etc.

   This document defines an option with subtype number which denotes a
   specific type of identifier.  One instance of subtype, the NAI is
   defined in Section 3.1.  It is anticipated that other identifiers
   will be defined for use in the mobility header in the future.

3.  Mobile Node Identifier option

   The Mobile node identifier option is a new optional data field that
   is carried in the Mobile IPv6 defined messages which includes the
   mobility header.  Various forms of identifiers can be used to
   identify a MN.  Some examples include a Network Access Identifier
   (NAI) [RFC_2486bis], an opaque identifier applicable to a particular
   application, etc.  The subtype field in the option defines the
   specific type of identifier.

   This option can be used in mobility messages containing a mobility
   header.  The subtype field in the option is used to interpret the
   specific type of identifier.

       |  Subtype      |          Identifier ...
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


      Option Type:

         MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE to be defined by IANA.  An 8-bit identifier
         of the type mobility option.

      Option Length:

         8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length in octets of
         the Subtype and Identifier fields.

      Subtype:

         Subtype field defines the specific type of identifier included
         in the identifier field.

      Identifier:

         A variable length identifier of type as specified by the
         subtype field of this option.

   This option does not have any alignment requirements.

3.1  MN-NAI mobility option

   The format of the MN-NAI mobility option is as defined in Section 3.
   This option uses the subtype value of 1.  The MN-NAI mobility option
   is used to identify the mobile node.

   The MN-NAI mobility option uses an identifier of the form user@realm
   [RFC_2486bis].

3.2  Processing Considerations

   The location of the MN identifier option is as follows: When present,
   this option MUST appear before any authentication related option in a
   message containing a mobility header.

4.  Security Considerations

   Mobile IPv6 already contains one mechanism for identifying mobile
   nodes, the Home Address Option [RFC 3775].  As a result, the
   vulnerabilities of the new option defined in this document are
   similar to those that already exist for Mobile IPv6.  In particular,
   the use of a permanent, stable identifier may compromise the privacy
   of the user, making it possible to track a particular device or user
   as it moves through different locations.

   In addition, since an NAI reveals the home affiliation of a user, it
   may assist an attacker in determining the identity of the user, help
   the attacker in targeting specific victims, or assist in further
   probing of the username space.

   These vulnerabilities can be addressed through various mechanisms,
   such as those discussed below:

   o  Encrypting traffic at link layer such that other users on the same
      link do not see the identifiers.  This mechanism does not help
      against attackers on the rest of the path between the mobile node
      and its home agent.

   o  Encrypting the whole packet, such as when using IPsec to protect
      the communications with the home agent [RFC 3776].

   o  Using an authentication mechanism that enables the use of privacy
      NAIs [RFC_2486bis] or temporary, changing "pseudonyms" as
      identifiers.

   In any case, it should be noted that as the identifier option is only
   needed on the first registration at the home agent and subsequent
   registrations can use the home address, the window of privacy
   vulnerability in this document is reduced as compared to the RFC
   3775.  In addition, this document is a part of a solution to allow
   dynamic home addresses to be used.  This is an improvement to privacy
   as well, and affects both communications with the home agent and the
   correspondent nodes, both of which have to be told the home address.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA services are required for this document.  The values for new
   mobility options must be assigned from the Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775]
   numbering space.

   The values for Mobility Option types MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE as defined in
   Section 3 need to be assigned.  The suggested value is 7 for the
   MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE.

   IANA should record a value for this new mobility option.

   In addition, IANA needs to create a new namespace for the subtype
   field of the Mobile Node Identifier Option.  The currently allocated
   values are as follows:

   NAI (defined in this document)      [1]

   New values for this namespace can be allocated using Standards Action
   [RFC2434].
