        Export of MPLS Segment Routing Label Type Information in
                   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
                draft-tgraf-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-01

Abstract

   This document introduces two additional values in the Information
   Element mplsTopLabelType for IS-IS and OSPF MPLS Segment Routing (SR)
   extensions to enable Segment Routing label type information in IP
   Flow Information Export (IPFIX).

1.  Introduction

   Besides existing MPLS control plane protocols such as BGP-4
   [RFC8277], LDP [RFC5036] and BGP VPN [RFC4364], IS-IS Extensions
   [RFC8667] and OSPF Extensions [RFC8665] had been added to propagate
   Segment Routing labels for the MPLS dataplane [RFC8660].

   Traffic Accounting in Segment Routing Networks
   [I-D.ali-spring-sr-traffic-accounting] describes how IPFIX can be
   laveraged to account traffic to MPLS Segment Routing label dimensions
   within a Segment Routing domain.

   In the Information Model for IP Flow Information Export IPFIX
   [RFC5102], the information element #46 mplsTopLabelType describes
   which MPLS control plane protocol allocated the top-of-stack label in
   the MPLS label stack.  RFC 7012 section 7.2 [RFC7012] describes the
   IANA Information Element #46 SubRegistry [IANA-IPFIX-IE46] where new
   values should be added.

   By introducing two new values to information element #46
   mplsTopLabelType for IS-IS and OSPF, when Segment Routing with one of
   these two routing protocols is deployed, we get insight which traffic
   is being forwarded based on which MPLS control plane protocol.  A
   typical use case scenario is to monitor MPLS control plane migrations
   from LDP to IS-IS or OSPF.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies two additional values for IS-IS and OSPF
   Segment Routing extension in the sub-registry "IPFIX MPLS label type
   (Value 46)" of the "IPFIX Information Elements" registry in the "IP
   Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Entities" name space.

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.
