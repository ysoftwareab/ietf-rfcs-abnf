1. Introduction

   This memo describes how a BEEP [1] session is mapped onto the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol [3].  Refer to Section 2.5 of [1] for
   an explanation of the mapping requirements.

3. Session Management

   The mapping of BEEP session management onto the SCTP service is
   straight-forward.

   A BEEP session is established when a SCTP association is established
   between two BEEP peers:

   o  the BEEP peer that issues an ASSOCIATE call is termed the
      initiator; and,

   o  the BEEP peer that receives a COMMUNICATIONS UP notification is
      termed the listener.

   During association establishment, both BEEP peers request as many
   outbound SCTP streams as possible.

   A BEEP session is released when either peer issues the SHUTDOWN call,
   and the SCTP association is subsequently terminated.

   A BEEP session is terminated when either peer issues the CLOSE call,
   and the SCTP association is subsequently aborted.

4. Message Exchange

   The mapping of BEEP exchanges onto the SCTP service is straight-
   forward.

   Messages on a given channel are reliably sent and received using the
   SEND and RECEIVE calls:

   o  the mapping between BEEP channel numbers and SCTP stream
      identifiers is the identity function; and,

   o  the "unorder" flag is not present to provide orderly delivery of
      messages on the same BEEP channel.

   When BEEP is mapped over SCTP, the underlying SCTP implementation
   MUST support the the extensions for stream flow limits.  [5]  This
   requirement arises because the transport layer window space is shared
   across multiple streams; a per-stream flow control window is needed
   to avoid starvation and deadlock when multiple channels are used
   simultaneously on a BEEP session.

   In the mapping of BEEP over a single TCP connection [2], SEQ frames
   are used to manage a sliding window for each channel.   In the BEEP
   over SCTP mapping, SEQ frames are not used.   Instead, upon channel
   creation, the BEEP peer should set the stream byte limit [5] to the
   amount of buffer space set aside for that channel (not less than 4096
   bytes.)

5. Special Behavior

   If use of a transport security profile is negotiated, then in
   addition to be used over BEEP channel (SCTP stream) zero, each time a
   BEEP channel is created, a new transport security context must be
   negotiated over the underlying SCTP stream.
