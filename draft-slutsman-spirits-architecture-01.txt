   of SPIRIT services.) Specifically, it defines the components
   constituting the architecture and the interfaces between the
   components.

   The rest of the document is organized as follows:

2. Brief Description of Example SPIRITS Services

   To illustrate the motivation for the overall SPIRIT architecture,
   this section provides a brief description of the example SPIRITS
   services:
   + Internet Call Waiting (ICW),
   + Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and
   + Internet Call Forwarding.

   These services are considered from the end-user point of view under
   the assumptions below:

   + Service subscription (or cancellation) is a separate process and
   may be done over the telephone, via postal mail, or over the Web.

   + The subscriber's IP host (e.g., a PC) is loaded with the necessary
   software [including a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and the IP
   addresses of the SPIRITS servers] for realizing the SPIRITS services.
   The software may be sent by postal mail or downloaded from the Web.

   + The subscriber activates a SPIRITS service by an act of service
   session registration, which can take place anytime after he (or she)
   is connected to the Internet. The subscriber may specify the life
   span of the session. As soon as the session ends, the SPIRITS service
   is deactivated. Naturally, the subscriber should also be able to
   deactivate a SPIRITS service anytime during the service session.

2.1 Internet Call Waiting (ICW)

   The Internet call waiting service enables a subscriber engaged in an
   Internet dial-up session to

      o be notified of an incoming call to the very same telephone line
        that is being used for the Internet connection;

      o specify the desirable treatment of the call; and

      o have the call handled as specified.

   The details of the ICW service lie in the ways that a waiting call
   can be treated [1]. Typical ways for handling a call include:

   + Accept the incoming call over the PSTN by terminating the Internet
   connection. (As switching cannot be done immediately, the caller may
   hear an opening announcement followed by the "ringing" tone.)

   + Forward the incoming call to another telephone number. The

SPIRITS Architecture                                            [Page 3]


   subscriber will remain connected to the Internet, while the caller
   will hear an announcement indicating the call is being forwarded and
   eventually be connected to the new destination number.

   + Accept the incoming call by voice over IP. The subscriber will
   answer the incoming call via the already established Internet
   connection. (The proposed SPIRITS architecture, however, does not
   reflect this feature.)

   + Redirect the incoming call to voice mail. The subscriber will
   remain connected to the Internet, while the caller will hear an
   announcement inviting him (or her) to leave a message.

   + Play a pre-recorded message to the calling party and disconnect the
   call. The subscriber will remain connected to the Internet.

   + Reject the incoming call. The subscriber will remain connected to
   the Internet, while the caller will hear an announcement rejecting
   the call.

   The subscriber may specify the call treatment on the fly when
   notified of an incoming call. Alternatively, the subscriber may
   specify a priori a general treatment for all calls (e.g., re-directed
   to voice mail) or call treatments tailored to the origination
   numbers. As a result, when a call comes in, the subscriber won't be
   presented the call but can examine afterwards the treatment and
   outcome of the call from the log that is kept for all the calls
   processed during the ICW service. Typical information recorded in the
   log includes the incoming call date and time, calling party number,
   calling party name, and call disposition.

2.2 Internet Caller-ID Delivery

   This service allows the subscriber to see the caller's number or name
   or both while being connected to the Internet. If the subscriber has
   only one telephone line and is using the very line for the Internet
   connection, the service is a subset of the ICW service and follows
   the relevant description in Section 2.1. Otherwise, the subscriber's
   IP host serves as an auxiliary device of the telephone to which the
   call is first sent.

2.3 Internet Call Forwarding

   The Internet call forwarding service allows a service subscriber to
   forward an incoming call to another telephone number while being
   connected to the Internet. If the subscriber has only one telephone
   line and is using the very line for the Internet connection, the
   service is a subset of the ICW service and follows the relevant
   description in Section 2.1. Otherwise, the subscriber's IP host
   serves as an auxiliary device of the telephone to which the call is
   first sent.


3. SPIRITS Architecture



<draft-slutsman-spirits-architecture-01.txt>                  April 2001





SPIRITS Architecture                                            [Page 4]


   Figure 1 of the Appendix depicts the SPIRITS architecture, which
   includes the following entities:

   1. Service Control Function (SCF) [2], which executes service logic,
   interacts with the entities in the IP domain (e.g., the SPIRITS Proxy
   and PINT Server) through the SPIRITS Client, and instructs the
   switches on how to complete a call. Physically, the SCF may be
   located in either stand-alone general-purpose computers called
   Service Control Points (SCPs) or specialized pieces of equipment
   called Service Nodes (SNs) [2].

   2. Service Switching Function (SSF) [2], which normally resides in a
   switch and is responsible for the recognition of Intelligent Network
   (IN) triggers and interactions with the SCF.

   3. SPIRITS Client, which is responsible for receiving PSTN requests
   from the SCF as well as sending responses back. It may be co-located
   with the SCF. If not, it communicates with the SCF over the D
   interface.

   4. PINT Server, which receives PINT requests from the PINT Client and
   relays them to the PSTN for execution over the E interface.

   5. SPIRITS Proxy, which is co-located with the PINT Server and serves
   as an intermediary between the SPIRITS Server and SPRITS Client via
   the B and C interfaces, respectively.

   6. PINT Client, which resides in the subscriber's IP host and is
   responsible for initiating PINT requests, which are sent to the PINT
   server over the A interface.

   7. SPIRITS Server, which terminates PSTN requests and is responsible
   for all interactions (e.g., incoming call notification and relaying
   the call treatment) between the subscriber and the SPIRITS proxy.

   The rest of the Section describes the interfaces between the entities
   in detail.

3.1 Interface A

   This interface is used for sending PINT request to PINT Server. Its
   principal use is for service session registration and as a result
   activation of a SPIRITS service (see Section 2). In addition, this
   interface may be used for service subscription.

3.2 Interface B

   This interface serves two main purposes: 1) to notify the subscriber
   of incoming calls together with the calling number and name, if
   available; and 2) to send to the SPRITS Proxy the subscriber's choice
   of call disposition specified on the fly.

3.3 Interface C




<draft-slutsman-spirits-architecture-01.txt>                  April 2001





SPIRITS Architecture                                            [Page 5]


   This interface is used for communications between the SPIRITS Client
   and SPIRITS Proxy.  The SPIRITS Proxy may in turn communicate with
   the SPRITS Server, or may act as a virtual server, terminating the
   requests without sending them down to the SPIRITS Server.

3.4 Interface D

   This interface is for communications between the SPIRITS Client and
   the SCF. Specifically, from the SCF to the SPIRITS Client, the
   parameters associated with the applicable IN triggers are sent. From
   the SPIRITS Client to SCF, the subscriber's call disposition is sent.
   The SCF "transforms" the user's disposition into appropriate actions,
   such as playing an announcement to the caller, and resuming the
   suspended call processing in the SSP.

3.5 Interface E

   This interface is for sending PINT requests to the SCF for execution.


4. Security Considerations

   It is assumed that the interface C is between trusting entities. In
   addition, the assumption that the PINT Client and SPIRITS Server are
   collocated dictates that the security considerations for the A and B
   interfaces are exactly the same.
