   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in draft-mboned-maccnt-req-01.txt. In 
   this framework a user sends a request for multicast data to a network 
   service provider which then selects the appropriate content provider 
   to which it then sends on the request transparently in a way so that 
   the network service provider and content provider do not need to know 
   the corresponding user id for the same user in the other provider's 
   domain.  The content provider then responds with success of failure 
   to the network provider and if success, the network provider may 
   delivery the requested data to the user.  The network service may 
   base its decision to deliver such data to the user based on its 
   bandwidth management policy.

1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Purpose and Background 
    
   IP multicasting is designed to serve cases where a single source of 
   data content is to be concurrently streamed to multiple recipients.  
   In these types of cases, multicasting provides resource efficiencies 
   (both for the overall network and the content server)relative to 
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi and He  [Page 2] 
    
   Internet Draft   draft-satou-multiaaa-framework-00.txt  October, 2005 
    
    
   unicasting.  These efficiencies are possible because of the avoidance 
   of unneccesary duplication of streams, video/audio processing, etc. 
   Multicasting also provides resource advantages relative to IP 
   broadcasting in that content data is only delivered to end hosts 
   which request it.   
    
    
   There are many real-life situations where IP multicasting is selected 
   as the technology used for concurrent content delivery of identical 
   content data to multiple end-hosts.   draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-
   01.txt (a work in progress, hereafter MACCNT-REQ-draft) describes the 
   requirements in CDN services using IP multicast. draft-ietf-mboned-
   rac-issues-01.txt (a work in progress, hereafter RAC-ISSUES-draft) 
   discusses the requirements and existing support for commercial, 
   large-scale content delivery.  The requirements are derived from: 
        - need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        - need for network access control and/or content access control 
   satisfactory to the requirements of the CP 
        - methods for sharing information between the network service 
   provider and content provider to make the above two possible. 
    
   Detailed requirements are presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.   These 
   requirements include mechanisms for recording end-user requests and 
   provider responses for content-delivery, sharing user information 
   (possibly anonymous depending on the trust model) between content 
   provider and network service provider, and protecting resources 
   through preventing network and content access by unauthorized users, 
   as well as other AAA related requirements. 
     
   The purpose of this memo is to provide a generalized framework for  
   solution standards to meet these requirements.  
    
2. Definitions and Abbreviations 
    
2.1 Definitions 
    
   For the purposes of this I-D the following definitions apply: 
    
   Accounting: actions for grasping each user's behavior, when she/he 
   starts/stops to receive a channel, which channel she/he receives, etc. 
 
   Authentication: action for identifying a user as a genuine one. 
 
   Authorization: action for giving permission to access the content or 
   network to a user. 
    
   Receiver: an end-host or end-client which receives content.  A 
   receiver may be distinguishable by a network ID such as MAC address 
   or IP address.

3. Issues in multicasting related to commercial and large-scale 
   implementations 
 
   This section lists issues related to receiver access control in 
   current multicasting protocols which are especially important to 
   commercial, large-scale multicasting.  More details concerning the 
   requirements related to these issues are provided in a separate I-D

3.1 Framework for multicast AAA allowing bandwidth Management   
 
   A general high-level framework can be represented as follows. 
    
            +------------------------------+ 
            |    user                      | 
            |                              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
                | Access       ^ Response 
                | Request      | & Multicast Data 
                V              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
            |    NSP                       | 
            |                              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
                | Authentication ^ Response 
                | Request        | (Success) 
                v                | 
            +------------------------------+ 
            |    CP                        | 
            |                              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
 
   Description: 
    
   First a user desiring authorization sends an Access request to  NSP 
   which then forwards it on to the appropriate CP for Authentication 
   and Authorization. The CP responds with either success of failure.  
   If success the NP forwards a success response and stream multicast 
   data to the user. 
    
   For the sake of simplicity, the above diagram portrays a case where 
   there is a singe NSP entity and a single CP entity.  Under the 
   framework it is possible for there to be multiple CPs connected to 
   the same network, at the same time it is possible for the same CP to 
   be connected to multiple NSP networks (e.g. network selection).  In 
   other words the relationship of NSP:CP can be described as  1:1, 1:N 
   or M:N.   
    
   In this model the user selects the NSP to which to send its content 
   request.  Based on this request the NSP selects an appropriate CP to 
   which to forward such request. The CP responds to the NSP's request:  
   it should not respond to another NSP in regards to the request.  
 
3.2 Multiple User IDs 
    
   Users may be assigned separate user IDs for each subscription for  
   various CPs.  When the user wants to access content, the user 
   registers the corresponding user ID with a request for content. 
    
    
    
    
   Satou, Ohta, Hayashi and He  [Page 5] 
    
   Internet Draft   draft-satou-multiaaa-framework-00.txt  October, 2005 
    
    
    
   Each CP may identify users by the user IDs which it has issued to 
   them. 
    
   The NSP and CP do not need to know the corresponding user id for the 
   same user in the other provider's domain, and it is not necessary 
   that there is a one to one relationship.  It is quite possible for 
   one person to hold multiple user ids for the same provider. 
 
3.3 Access Control and CP selection by NSP 
    
   When a NSP receives an access request from a user, it is necessary 
   for the NSP to determine to which CP the request is directed. It is 
   necessary for the NSP to ensure that it is not spoofed by an 
   inappropriate CP. 
 
3.4 Bandwidth Management by NSP 
 
   After the NSP authorizes a user request, NSP may conduct admission 
   control based on NSP's bandwidth management policy. For example, if 
   the NSP manages the shared bandwidth of access lines, the NSP might 
   calculate available bandwidth and necessary bandwidth, and based on 
   these calculations determine to accept or reject the user request. 
    
3.5 Access Control and Distinguishing of Users by CP 
    
   The user ID and authentication information are forwarded 
   transparently by the NSP so that the CP can distinguish the user. As 
   the NSP forwards user's requests to the target CP, the CP can 
   authenticate and authorize the user's request. 
    
3.6 Multicast Session Management for Accounting 
    
   The NSP should not manage multicast states on a subnet basis, but on 
   a user basis because the NSP needs to notify start and stop times for 
   accounting purposes. This means that the NSP sends an indication for 
   Join and Leave on a user basis.  
 
4. IANA considerations 
    
   This I-D does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
5. Security considerations 
    
   Refer to section 3.3.  Also the user information related to 
   authentication with the CP should be protected in some way.  
   Otherwise, this I-D does not raise any new security issues which are 
   not already existing in original protocols.  Enhancement of multicast 
   access control capabilities may enhance security performance.

6. Conclusion 
    
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in draft-mboned-maccnt-req-01.txt.  
   Further work should be done to break down the content provider and 
   network service provider entities into their functional objects such 
   as edge devices, AAA servers, etc.
