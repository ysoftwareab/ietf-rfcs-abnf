   Abstract

      This document discusses how inter-domain routing using Shared Risk
      Group (SRG) may be used for computing diverse paths, and also
      discusses the extensions that we propose for routing (and eventually
      signaling) protocols. The concepts proposed in this document are
      useful to provide the requested intelligent control plane for multi-
      layered networks.

   1. Introduction

      For many years in the telecommunications industry, the concept of
      SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) has been used for computing a path
      that is disjoint from a set of links sharing the same risk. For this
      purpose, links sharing the same risk are grouped together to have
      the same SRLG value. When two links (or more) share the same risk,
      it means that when one link fails the other(s) can fail
      simultaneously. Reference [IETF-DIMITRI-SRLG] provides enhancements
      to the concept of SRLGs thereby streamlining its meaning.

      Networks are planned to recover from failures due to a risk
      (represented by an SRLG) using different mechanisms, which we call
      capabilities. So if we look at SRLG on a positive note we may want
      to intentionally use the capabilities supported in the network due
      to an SRLG. For example one may provide a 1:1 shared link protection
      (link capability) for many connections using the link that has an
      SRLG value of X.

      A risk sharing, however, is not limited to links, which has been the
      case until now in a majority of the IETF proposals (e.g., [IETF-
      KIREETI-OSPF]). In this document, we extend the applicability of
      SRLGs to path (or connections) included in a domain, where we define
      a domain to be a group of resources (nodes and links) that provide
      similar capabilities and that share the same set of risk(s). For
      example a domain can be consecutive set of links that has 1:1 link
      level protection or a set of links that form a ring. Note that in
      such a scenario (for example in ring topology), a failure will
      affect all the other resources in the domain. This observation
      parallels the notion of what SRLG for a link to an SRG (Shared Risk
      Group) for a domain. One can visualize the similar capabilities of a
      domain to be the same protection capabilities, the same link
      encoding type, same multiplexing capability, same resource class and
      same Traffic-Engineering Metric etc.

      The ôshared risk conceptö can also be viewed as a mechanism to hide
      or reduce the amount of topology information propagated in a multi-
      layered network. Consider a multi-layered network with fiber,
      optical (for instance G.709 OTN), SONET/SDH and router topology in
      the ascending order of encompassing the previous topology. Here the
      upper layer (which encompasses the lower layers) is called the
      client layer and the lower layer is called the server layer. In such
      a topology a link at the client layer (for example, router level)
      can mean many nodes and links in the server layer (for example,
      SONET/SDH, optical and fiber level). Hence to provide diversity at
      the client layer link level one should consider failures in the
      server layer topology. Thus, to provide diverse links or paths
      (sequences of links) at the client layer requires some means of
      abstracting the diversity at the server layer, so that this
      abstraction can be used by path computation at the client layer. At
      present the only way to provide this abstraction of the server layer
      topology in the client layers is to use SRLG. With the adoption of

      GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) control plane in
      the packet and circuit based networks it is now possible to compute
      diverse paths in multiple layers. The notion of diversity can be
      abstracted and dynamically computed at many layers. In this
      document, we concentrate on the risk associated with a sequence of
      disjoint elements (unlike in case of SRLG). The procedures of doing
      such a complex task is provided in this document.

      The following observations serve as a basis for considering the
      extension of the ôShared riskö concept to more than just a link:

      - The number of nodes or links that are affected by a failure is
        dependent on the physical topology of the network (or the server
        layer(s) topology in a multi-layered network).
          - A typical node failure may also represent the failure of set
            of links, or multiple link failures or SRLGs.
          - On the other hand, a failure of a fiber (or a group of fibers)
            may result in the failure of multiple logical links, which
            topologically could be forming a ring or point-to-multipoint
            mesh network.
      - The abstraction of the capability of a domain can be useful in
          - Summarizing (so reducing) the amount of information propagated
            in the routing protocols,
          - Hiding the topology of the domain for the sake of loose path
            specification (and hence loose path computation) Computing
            diverse paths by concatenating the capabilities of the
            domains.
          - Hiding the topology details of the server layers in a multi-
            layered network (if needed).
      - Sharing risk is opposite to capability of a domain, which is a
        required parameter for service provisioning by ISPs.
          - Establishing a primary path disjoint from the secondary one at
            the same layer reduces the chances of losing traffic or
            dropping traffic for longer time.  This can be logically
            concatenated by the notion of domains and domain capabilities.
            These domains can belong to a single level to multiple levels
            (as in multi-layered networks).
          - Such a notion enables more factual based risk assessment and
            hence helps in achieving risk reduction by improving
            incremental topological design.

      This document is organized as follows:

      Section 2 specifies the applicability of the SRG concept aligned
      with the carrier requirements detailed in Section 3. Then, the
      definition and the scope of the  ôrisk Domainö concept are proposed
      in Section 4. The corresponding TE-Routing protocol extensions are
      detailed in Section 5 and a preliminary version of potential
      encoding of these extensions are suggested in Section 6. In the
      appendices we discuss the motivation and usage of this work for
      computing diversity and risk.

   2. Applicability

      The mechanisms proposed in this draft are applicable to the
      following operational areas:

      - To achieve constraint based path computation in a multi-layered
        network with integrated control plane and reduction in the amount
        of TE (Traffic Engineering) parameters.

      - To hide the topology in a tiered network (whether control planes
        overlay or peer-to-peer) with a single or multiple administrators
        to the domain(s).

      - To reduce the amount of TE information propagated by localizing
        the scope of information propagation and hence distribution of
        the path computation.

      - To propose mechanisms that are applicable to packet and non-
        packet oriented networks (multi-service networks) in the scope of
        GMPLS architecture independently of the path provisioning state.

   3. Carrier requirements

      As mentioned in [OIF-CARRIER-REQ] and [IPO-JOHN-IMP], the diversity
      compromises between two links being used for routing should be
      defined in terms of Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), a group of
      links which share some resource, such as a specific sequence of
      fiber ducts or a specific office. A SRLG is a relationship between
      the resources that should be characterized by two parameters:

      - Type of Compromise: Examples would be shared fiber cable, shared
        conduit, shared ROW, shared link on an optical ring, shared
        office - no power sharing, etc.)
          - Support for hierarchical SRLG allocation
          - Support for logical level and physical level diversity
          - Support for computing diverse path computation over multi-
            layered networks
          - Support for hiding lower-layer capability in the upper layers
      - Extent of Compromise:  For compromised outside plant, this would
        be the length of the sharing.

   4. Definitions and scope

   4.1. Definition of risk domain

      Definition: A ôrisk domainö is a group of arbitrarily connected
      nodes and links that together can provide certain like-capabilities
      (such as a chain of dedicated/shared protected links and nodes, or a
      ring forming nodes and links).

      This is advertised in the routing protocols as ôrisk domain linkö,
      an abstract point-to-multipoint link. It is rather advisable not
      advertising this as NBMA link to avoid the complexity of the


   Internet Draft - CCAMP Working Group û Expires January 2002          4

   draft-many-ccamp-srg-00.txt                                   July 2001


      designated router. This solution does not, however, preclude
      handling of the risk domain concept via a representation as a NBMA
      link.

      Another way to see the risk domain link is as a Forwarding Adjacency
      (FA û refer to [IETF-KIREETI-FA]) if and only if source and
      destination are located within the same area and can have a pre-
      established path between them with the same capabilities in all the
      links through which this FA is passing through.

      This concept of risk domain in parallel to the assumptions made
      about the MPLS domain or DiffServ domain till now. This differs in
      the previous definition of the domains in the sense that it is
      represented in the routing protocols and signaling protocols with
      domain-related values.

      In the current document, we assume a risk domain is part of a
      routing (OSPF or ISIS) area. From now on, we use the term domain
      interchangeably with risk domain.

   4.2. Definition of SRG

      Definition: An SRG (a 32 bit integer) represents the risk domainsÆ
      capabilities and other parameters, which assist in computing diverse
      paths through the domain and in assessing the risk associated with
      the risk domain.

      With the observations made in section 1 and the introduction of the
      concept of a risk domain, we define the notion of a ôShared Risk
      Groupö (SRG) per risk domain.

      Note that the SRLGs of this risk domain are a subset of the SRGs.
      SRLGs address only risks associated with the links (physical and
      logical) and locations within the risk domain, whereas SRGs contains
      nodes and other topological information in addition to links. The
      key difference between an SRLG and an SRG is that an SRLG translates
      to only one link share risk with respect to server layer topology
      (even FA and virtual links) while an SRG translates a sequence of
      SRLGs (including nodes) over the same layer from one source to one
      or more than one destination located within the same area.

   4.3. Scope

      The following are the goals of this work:

      - Diversity:
          - To capture link, node and domain-level diversity with minimal
            TE information.
          - Summarizable SRG notation, which decreases the complexity of
            computing disjoint paths.
          - Propose a mechanism that works for both single and multi-
            layered networks, which use Generalized MPLS distributed

            control plane. In the first version of the document we
            consider only intra-AS networks with single layer topology. In
            the future version we will generalize the mechanism to inter-
            AS and multi-layered architectures.
      - Risk:
          - Assign capabilities to the SRGs such Resource Class, TE
            Metric, etc.
          - Assign failure probability to the SRGs, which, in turn, enable
            the ôevaluationö of the probabilities corresponding to the
            risk assessment.
          - Facilitate path computation against a given risk type. This
            case will be handled in the future versions of the document.
      - Other:
          - SRLG is currently a flat 32 bit number in a given autonomous
            system. The notion of SRG will help in localization of SRLG
            allocation and hence helps in summarization.
          - Deployment (i.e., operational aspects) of a SRLG or SRG
            capable network.

   5. Protocol requirements

      The following are the protocol related requirements (mainly related
      to traffic-engineering routing protocol extensions), which are
      elaborated in this document:

      - Configuration: To enable the SRG mechanism the following
         configuration parameters may be required.
          - Domain boundary configuration
          - Hierarchical SRLG configuration
          - Domain to SRG allocation
          - Per SRG capabilities and risk factor allocation
          - Preferred path allocation parameters
          - Other link related parameters that can be extended to SRG such
            as TE Metric (additive metric), Resource Class (ON/OFF), etc.
      - Encoding (refer to [IETF-DIMITRI-SRLG]):
          - Logical and physical structure: A logical and physical
            encoding of SRLGs should be proposed to reduce the number of
            SRLGs with scalability in mind. This also helps in hiding the
            actual underlying network topology in many cases, and allows
            for loose path computation. Refer to [IETF-DIMITRI-SRLG] for
            more information on this subject. In addition an encoding
            mechanism should be devised to derive the capabilities of a
            domain (which is represented by an SRG).
      - Capability assignment
          - Domain, node, and link capability: Domain capability such as
            transport network level diversity (node, link, SRLG, path)
            provided by the domain can be associated with the SRG. This
            helps in deciding the logical and physical topologies of
            choice for the path. Other capabilities such as TE Metric and
            Resource Class can also be considered.
          - Risk assessment parameters: Risks can be associated with both
            the SRGs to assess the possible risk associated with a path.


   Internet Draft - CCAMP Working Group û Expires January 2002          6

   draft-many-ccamp-srg-00.txt                                   July 2001


          - Preferential route selection: By associating weights to the
            SRGs, one can make the path selection algorithms choose
            certain SRG path(s).
      - Routing protocol extensions to propagate them (distinction should
         be done between inter and intra-domain routing)
          - Given the domain-level decomposition of the physical topology
            of the optical network, the link semantics should be extended
            to accommodate the inter-domain links. Moreover, this concept
            helps in constructing logical- topologies at the domain-level
            abstraction, which in turn can be used in the SRG
            summarization and loose-path computation.
          - Propagate these additional links using the IGP routing
            protocols for intra- and inter-area routing purposes [probably
            that the ôdomainö is something that could be mapped to an IGP
            area so that inter-area routing would be more easy to
            achieve].
          - To reduce the amount of the flooded information and hence
            lightpath route computation complexity, the flooding scope of
            the information propagation is extended to accommodate domain-
            level.
          - Propagate the capability, risk assessment, and preferential
            route selection parameters per SRG.
      - CSPF to use this path
          - Extend constraint-based path computation to accommodate the
            above extensions.

      In the following sections we will elaborate each of these topics
      individually.

   6. Extensions

   6.1. Configuration

      The configuration parameters considered are the following:

      Domain boundary configuration: This is the configuration of domain
      to provide a boundary for summarization or hiding the capability
      information, as will be elaborated in the next few sections. This is
      in parallel to the concept of an area boundary in the existing IGPs.

      Hierarchical SRLG configuration: The hierarchical SRLG configuration
      is provided by the SRLG encoding itself. In [IETF-DIMITRI-SRLG], the
      SRLG are encoded as a Resource Location and a Resource Identifier.
      The latter includes a list of type û SRLG identifier fields. This
      concept helps in localizing SRLG allocation, hiding the server layer
      link level topology and in reducing amount of server layer TE
      information propagation.

      Domain to SRG allocation: Grouping of nodes and links that provide
      certain capability will have an SRG allocated to it. The SRG value
      can be a flat 32-bit number or can represent some of the domain
      capabilities. The SRG encoding will be discussed in the future



   Internet Draft - CCAMP Working Group û Expires January 2002          7

   draft-many-ccamp-srg-00.txt                                   July 2001


      versions of the document. The node ID from which the point-to-
      multipoint virtual link starts identifies the SRG allocation. This
      means that the root of the virtual point-to-multipoint link defines
      the SRG allocation.

      Per SRG capability allocation: The capabilities of the domain such
      as protection and restoration can be assigned per domain. Please
      note that the likeness of these capabilities across the domain is a
      requirement for a link or a node to be part of the domain. Other
      link related parameters that can be extended to SRG such as TE
      Metric (additive metric), Resource Class (ON/OFF), etc could be also
      allocated per SRG.

      Capability to risk factor parameters: Risk associate with a domain
      depends on the protection and restoration mechanisms inherent to the
      domain and that can be achieved through the capabilities of the
      domain. Since the risk domain belongs to a single operator, we can
      assign these parameters per mechanism per domain. This can be
      assigned per type of failure per SRG.

      Preferred path allocation parameters: This is the weight associated
      to the SRG. This weight can be assigned statically configured once
      at the initial stage or dynamically determined since it can be
      defined as additive metric whose individual values are the link TE
      metrics.

   6.2. Encoding

      A hierarchical encoding mechanism is the key to the summarization
      process of the SRLGs of a given server layer link. This encoding can
      be performed on the physical and logical resources as elaborated in
      [IETF-DIMITRI-SRLG]. SRG on the other hand represents a both the
      nodes and the links, which can take the same hierarchical encoding
      as in SRLG, but in the current version of the document we assume it
      to be a 32-bit flat number with the capabilities being specified as
      TLVs.

   6.3. Capability assignment

      Refer to [IETF-GMPLS-ARCH] to get the complete list of the link
      capabilities that can be propagated. Here we envision at least the
      protection related capabilities can be extended to the domain level,
      in addition we have few more parameters, which assist in the risk
      assessment, as discussed below.

      - Capability assignment (will be elaborated further in the later
        versions of the document): This is assigned to each of the SRG,
        which is propagated in the opaque LSA in the routing protocols
        and assists in the diverse path computation and risk assessment.
         - Domain capability: Extensions similar to link capabilities as
           noted by [IETF-GMPLS-ARCH]. These include shared or dedicated
           protection capabilities of the links in the domain.

         - Node capability: Extensions similar to link capabilities as
           noted by [IETF-GMPLS-ARCH].
         - Link capability: Extensions as discussed by [IETF-GMPLS-ARCH].
         - Conditional probability for risk: This provides the operator
           assigned risk factor for a given SRG. This can be carried per
           type of failure.

   6.4. Routing protocol extensions

   6.4.1. Propagation of a domain link

      A network administrator groups a set of links and nodes of similar
      capabilities into a domain and assigns an SRG to the domain. A
      physical topology can have overlapping domains if links and/or nodes
      participating in the domain notion support multiple capabilities.

      A domain is represented as an abstract point-to-multipoint link for
      the sake of representation, and for path computation in the routing
      protocols. As discussed before, this can represent any type of
      physical topology represented under the abstract notion of domain.

      The exact semantics of the domain link opaque LSA (defined as an
      opaque LSA of Type 10) is presented in below. The scope of this
      opaque LSA can be link, area or AS specific.

   6.4.1.1 Opaque LSA Header

      The Opaque Type-specific ID (i.e. Opaque ID) is a 24-bit sub-field
      sub-divided in a reserved sub-field (8 MSB) and a Source specific
      sub-field (16 LSB).

      document we will elaborate on the other required TLVs specific to
      this document. Note that even the protection related TLVs would be
      specified per SRG (unlike per link in the case of regular networks).

   6.4.2. Path computation

      Path computation becomes very rich with this concept with the
      concept of the loose nodes and links being represented by the risk
      domain concept. A dynamic path computation mechanism can use the
      concatenation of the domains to compute the loose explicit path,
      leaving the expansion of the loose segments to the domain border
      nodes.

      First we start with one domain ôcomputationö and then expand it.
      Here below some guidelines:
      - Pruning of SRG that do not belong to the same resource class
      - Exclude all the resources already selected for other LSP using
        that SRG for the same VPN ID, same source node ID, etc.
      - Exclude all the resources already selected for the same
        restoration group of LSP (case of edge-to-edge protection)
      - Take the explicit inclusive and exclusive requirements into
        consideration

   7. Security Considerations

      Security considerations related to SRLG Inference model and its
      applications are left for further study.

   8. Conclusions

      In this document we presented the concept of a risk domain
      abstracting nodes and links with like-capabilities. This notion can
      be used very effectively for inter-domain routing by reducing the
      amount of TE information to be carried. We proposed a mechanism
      called SRG to capture this information and assist in diverse path
      computation and risk assessment in single and multi-layered
      networks.

   Appendix A: Diversity and SRG

      A brief introduction is provided to the need for diversity to set
      the stage for the rest of the discussion. Traffic engineering in IP
      (Internet Protocol) networks is achieved using MPLS technology as an
      overlay on the IP networks. The success of the MPLS TE concept has
      lead to its application in the optical domain as well. The ôpinnedö
      or connection-oriented nature of LSPs reduces the capability of IP
      traffic to recover automatically from failures in the data path. To
      achieve path resiliency, therefore, diverse paths must be
      established between the source and destination MPLS nodes through
      the use of explicit routing (loose or strict). By introducing the
      connection-oriented (LSPs) in the IP technology, we loose the
      automatic hop-by-hop recovery of the data paths in case of failures.
      Hence, diverse paths are established between the source and
      destination MPLS nodes for achieving path resiliency.

      The diversity requirements of transport networks have some
      differences with those of router (Layer 3 and Layer 2 switching)
      networks. They are mainly:

      - Transport networks provide elaborate protection and restoration
        mechanisms,

      - Transport topologies are not always structured in mesh topologies
        (agreed but in fact an OCh on top of an OMS SPRing for instance
        appears as a point-to-point connection at the OCh level  so that
        Ring topology does not necessarily mean ringed connection, as
        assumed by the router networks, and

      - Transport-level protection and restoration mechanisms are not
        considered in the diverse path computation by the MPLS technology
        (at least till now) dynamic path computation constructs.

      Diversity in the router world is achieved as follows:

         - Request: Given the (physical and logical) topology, link
            capabilities, and constraints to calculate 1 to N diverse path
            between two points in the network.
         - Input:
            - Topology:
              . Physical topology is always meshed and multiplexed (fiber,
                cables, segments etc.).
              . Areas and autonomous systems achieve logical topology.
            - Capability:
              . Only link capabilities are propagated.
            - Constraints:
              . Inclusive requirements: Such as a preferred links (color).
              . Exclusive requirements: Such as avoiding a node (node-
                level diversity, link-level diversity).
              . Limiting requirements: Such as bandwidth.
         - Output:
            - Paths available or not.

            - If paths are available then provide the strict or loose
              paths.
              . Strict paths can be provided if the physical topology is
                known between the source and destination.
              . Loose paths are provided if the end-to-end physical
                topology is not known.

      Diversity in the router + transport world may be achieved as
      follows:

      - Request: Given the (physical and logical) topology, link
         capabilities, domain capabilities and constraints to calculate 1
         to N diverse paths between two points in the network.
      - Input:
         - Topology:
           . Physical topology is flexible (Rings, Meshes, Ring-Mesh inter
             connected).
           . Domains (or islands) are used to achieve logical topology.
         - Capability:
           . Both link (or span) and domain capabilities need to be
             propagated.
         - Constraints:
           . Inclusive requirements: Such as preferred links and preferred
             link, node and domain capabilities.
           . Exclusive requirements: Such as avoiding a link, node or
             domain.
           . Limiting requirements: Such as bandwidth.
      - Output:
         - Paths available or not.
         - If paths are available then provide the strict or loose paths.
           . Strict paths can be provided if the physical topology is
             known between the source and destination û not necessarily I
             can provide an strict routed SDH L-LSP while being aware of
             the lambda topology but not on the fiber or duct topology.
           . Loose paths are provided if the end-to-end physical topology
             is not known or cannot be interpreted such as in ring
             topologies or would like to leave to the risk domain to
             decide (for local optimization or due to lack of information
             or to reduce TE information flooding) û not necessarily for
             instance inter-area routing can be loose even if the local
             source area physical topology is known.

      Discussion:

      The following observations can be made between the diverse path
      setup mechanisms in the router world and in the transport world:

      - Sharing risk is not only a property of the links, but it can be
        extended to nodes and domains. Thus, an SRG can be associated
        with the links, nodes, and even domains.

   draft-many-ccamp-srg-00.txt                                   July 2001


      - Also, for example, domain capabilities can be associated with the
        domain SRG to achieve inclusive constraints. For example, a BLSR
        ring can have an SRG with ring capabilities associated with it.

      As a precursor to achieving such constraints we propose to extend
      the SRLG notion to represent logical topologies. By assigning SRGs
      in a hierarchical fashion (to a region, a zone/domain and a node),
      we can capture the capabilities, and risks, associated with them. An
      extensive discussion on this subject is provided in [IETF-DIMITRI-
      SRLG].

      Considering the above practical knowledge of real world scenarios,
      it is essential (to reduce the computation time) to reduce the
      number of SRLGs by means of some encoding. We observe that the
      amount of configuration can also be reduced (for example, from 100s
      of SRLGs on a Trans-Atlantic link). This poses the following
      requirements:
      - Need a mechanism to encode (and hence summarizable) SRLG to group
        represent a link or node or domain wide individual SRGs.
      - Need to modify the path computation algorithms (such as CSPF) for
        accommodating the new encoding scheme.
      - Need to enhance the path computation mechanisms to work with the
        logical topologies (or domains).
      - Need to propagate the logical topologies (or domains) via the
        routing protocols.

   Appendix B: Risk assessment and SRG

      Risk (the complementary of availability) assessment is defined as
      the evaluation of the potential risk associated with the inclusion
      of a given resource (this resource belongs to a given resource type
      located within a given logical structure such as a geographical
      location) in a given path.

      A brief discussion for the motivation of the risk assessment
      capabilities of SRLG is provided here. Consider the following
      example, where the client device makes the following requests to the
      optical network:

       - Request (either through signaling protocols or using an SLA) for
         a persistent connection with 99.999 % (widely known 5 9s) of
         availability or equally a down time less than X minutes per year.

       - Request a high-protection for a portion of the traffic (at the
         expense of paying a higher charge) compared to other low-priority
         traffic.

      Such requirements will be translated into constraints in path
      computation. Such constraints can be grouped into path selection
      constraints and path characterization constraints.

      - Path selection constraints:

         These typically dictate which physical path should be taken to
         achieve the clientÆs availability requirements. These
         requirements are typically the logical and physical diversity.

      - Path characterization constraints:

         Path characterization requirements typically dictate the
         protection mechanisms as requested by the client. This can be
         achieved in the form of optical rings, meshed protection
         mechanisms, etc. These constraints can be used in using the link,
         node, and domain capabilities as discussed in the previous
         section on diversity.

      The components that need formalization in this example are:

      - Step 1. Specification of the user requirements (such as the
        example above), which need to be translated into ônetwork
        constraintsö.
      - Step 2. Configuring the network in a way that helps in assessing
        its features, such as the availability
      - Step 3. Propagating the information thus configured.
      - Step 4. Using information thus propagated in path computation.

      Step 1 of specifying the requirements is not in the scope of this
      document. Steps 2 - 4 are discussed below.

      Discussion:

      A convenient way to achieve risk assessment is by associating a
      conditional risk value with each of the SRLGs and SRGs, as discussed
      in [IETF-DIMITRI-SRLG]. Also, by associating a weight factor with
      the SRG, we can increase the choice of selecting specific SRGs. This
      calls for configuring:

      - A Risk factor per SRG
      - A Weight factor per SRG

      In addition to the SRG capabilities, discussed before, the above
      values can also be propagated via routing protocols. These routing
      requirements are discussed in the following section.

      With the help of the above two configuration parameters, the use of
      typical CSPF algorithms to compute a path can be extended to assess
      the risk associated with the path. For example, if a path traverses
      SRGs 1, 3, 5, then one may infer that the risk associated with this
      path is (Risk 1 x Risk 3 x Risk 5).
