1. Introduction 

   Abstract 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the 
   Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent when Mobile IP Traversal of 
   Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices are used. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580  
   [RFC2580]. 

3. Structure of the MIB 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for the use with network management protocols in the Internet 
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for the 
   Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices as 
   defined in [RFC3519]. 

3.1. Structure of the Mobile IP UDP Tunneling 

   The Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices 
   specifisation [RFC3519] specifies a few managed entities. These are 
   the behaviour to force and accept udp tunneling, and the 
   configuration of the keep alive timers. 

   The Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices 
   specifisation [RFC3519] also specifies a new error code for

   "Requested UDP tunnel encapsulation unavailable". Therefore a counter 
   object for this error code is also included in this mib module.  

   Further, it's good practice to include object to enable and disable 
   the MIP UDP tuning completely.  

   Configuration of MIP UDP tunneling has been deployed in various 
   vendore implementations for years. Field experience have shown that 
   it's indeed a good idea to always use UDP tunneling instead if the 
   original Mobile IP tunneling methods. Therefore, an object is added 
   in the HA to always force the use of UDP tunneling to all UDP 
   tunneling capable nodes, regardless of F-flag or outcome of NAT test.  

3.2. MIB Groups 

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups. Each group is related 
   to the Mobile IP entities Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent. 
   The Mobile IP entities Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent are 
   described in [RFC3344].

5. Security Considerations 

   Assuming that secure network management (such as SNMP v3) is 
   implemented, the objects represented in this MIB do not pose a threat 
   to the security of the network. 

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Such objects may be 
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. The 
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations. 

   Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure 
   environment. SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if 
   the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, 
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to 
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this 
   MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View- 
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended. 

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This section is to be done. It's stiul unclear wheither there should 
   be a new OID assigned from mib-2 space, or an OID under the mipMIB 
   OID should be used.

APPENDIX A: Todo and open issues 

A.1. OID placement 

   Since this is the first mib extending teh Mobile IP mib it's a bit 
   unclear how this mib should be placed in the OID structure. Most 
   probably there will be an OID assigned under mipMIB after IANA has 
   taken control over that OID space. Alternatively there could be a new 
   OID assigned by IANA under mib-2. For the sake of simplicity the 
   first approach is used in this version of the mib.  

A.2. Default values 

   In this first version of the mib default values have been defined for 
   all objects. This is good practice, however it's still an open issue 
   which values these default values should have. Except in the case 
   with keepalive timers, these values are not mandated from RFC3519, 
   but are just some assumtion of a useful configuration of the Mobile 
   IP UDP tunnelling function. 

   However, it differs from the default values used in both the 
   propriatory Cisco and ipUnplugged implementations so it would be 
   usedful with some input on the applicability.
