    Benchmarking Methodology for Network Security Device Performance
                  draft-ietf-bmwg-ngfw-performance-03

Abstract

   This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for
   next-generation network security devices including next-generation
   firewalls (NGFW), intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/
   IPS) and unified threat management (UTM) implementations.  This
   document aims to strongly improve the applicability, reproducibility,
   and transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology with
   today's increasingly complex layer 7 application use cases.  The main
   areas covered in this document are test terminology, traffic profiles
   and benchmarking methodology for NGFWs to start with.

1.  Introduction

   15 years have passed since IETF recommended test methodology and
   terminology for firewalls initially ([RFC2647], [RFC3511]).  The
   requirements for network security element performance and
   effectiveness have increased tremendously since then.  Security
   function implementations have evolved to more advanced areas and have
   diversified into intrusion detection and prevention, threat
   management, analysis of encrypted traffic, etc.  In an industry of
   growing importance, well-defined and reproducible key performance
   indicators (KPIs) are increasingly needed as they enable fair and
   reasonable comparison of network security functions.  All these
   reasons have led to the creation of a new next-generation firewall
   benchmarking document.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Scope

   This document provides testing terminology and testing methodology
   for next-generation firewalls security devices.  It covers security
   effectiveness configurations, followed by performance benchmark
   testing.  This document focuses on advanced, realistic, and
   reproducible testing methods.  Additionally, it describes test bed
   environments, test tool requirements and test result formats.

4.  Test Setup

   Test setup defined in this document is applicable to all benchmarking
   test scenarios described in Section 7.

4.1.  Testbed Configuration

   Testbed configuration MUST ensure that any performance implications
   that are discovered during the benchmark testing aren't due to the
   inherent physical network limitations such as number of physical
   links and forwarding performance capabilities (throughput and
   latency) of the network devise in the testbed.  For this reason, this
   document recommends avoiding external devices such as switches and
   routers in the testbed wherever possible.

   However, in the typical deployment, the security devices (Device
   Under Test/System Under Test) are connected to routers and switches
   which will reduce the number of entries in MAC or ARP tables of the
   Device Under Test/System Under Test (DUT/SUT).  If MAC or ARP tables
   have many entries, this may impact the actual DUT/SUT performance due
   to MAC and ARP/ND table lookup processes.  Therefore, it is
   RECOMMENDED to connect aggregation switches or routers between test
   equipment and DUT/SUT as shown in Figure 1.  The aggregation switches
   or routers can be also used to aggregate the test equipment or DUT/
   SUT ports, if the numbers of used ports are mismatched between test
   equipment and DUT/SUT.

   If the test equipment is capable of emulating layer 3 routing
   functionality and there is no need for test equipment port
   aggregation, it is RECOMMENDED to configure the test setup as shown
   in Figure 2.

4.2.  DUT/SUT Configuration

   A unique DUT/SUT configuration MUST be used for all benchmarking
   tests described in Section 7.  Since each DUT/SUT will have their own
   unique configuration, users SHOULD configure their device with the
   same parameters and security features that would be used in the
   actual deployment of the device or a typical deployment in order to
   achieve maximum security coverage.

   This document attempts to define the recommended security features
   which SHOULD be consistently enabled for all the benchmarking tests

   described in Section 7.  Table 1 below describes the sets of security
   feature list which SHOULD be configured on the DUT/SUT.

   Based on customer use case, users MAY enable or disable SSL
   inspection feature for "Throughput Performance with NetSecOPEN
   Traffic Mix" test scenario described in Section 7.1

   To improve repeatability, a summary of the DUT configuration
   including description of all enabled DUT/SUT features MUST be
   published with the benchmarking results.

   o  All security inspection enabled

   o  Disposition of all flows of traffic are logged - Logging to an
      external device is permissible

   o  Detection of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) matching
      the following characteristics when searching the National
      Vulnerability Database (NVD)


      *  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version: 2

      *  CVSS V2 Metrics: AV:N/Au:N/I:C/A:C

      *  AV=Attack Vector, Au=Authentication, I=Integrity and
         A=Availability

      *  CVSS V2 Severity: High (7-10)

      *  If doing a group test the published start date and published
         end date SHOULD be the same

   o  Geographical location filtering and Application Identification and
      Control configured to be triggered based on a site or application
      from the defined traffic mix

   In addition, a realistic number of access control rules (ACL) MUST be
   configured on the DUT/SUT.  However, this is applicable only for the
   security devices where ACL's are configurable.  This document
   determines the number of access policy rules for four different
   classes of DUT/SUT.  The classification of the DUT/SUT MAY be based
   on its maximum supported firewall throughput performance number
   defined in the vendor data sheet.  This document classifies the DUT/
   SUT in four different categories; namely Extra Small, Small, Medium,
   and Large.

   The RECOMMENDED throughput values for the following classes are:

   Extra Small (XS) - supported throughput less than 1Gbit/s

   Small (S) - supported throughput less than 5Gbit/s

   Medium (M) - supported throughput greater than 5Gbit/s and less than
   10Gbit/s

   Large (L) - supported throughput greater than 10Gbit/s

   The Access Control Rules (ACL) defined in Table 2 MUST be configured
   from top to bottom in the correct order as shown in the table.  The
   ACL entries MUST be configured in Forward Information Base (FIB)
   table of the DUT/SUT.  (Note: There will be differences between how
   security vendors implement ACL decision making.)  The configured ACL
   MUST NOT block the security and performance test traffic used for the
   benchmarking test scenarios.

4.3.  Test Equipment Configuration

   In general, test equipment allows configuring parameters in different
   protocol layers.  These parameters thereby influence the traffic
   flows which will be offered and impact performance measurements.

Internet-Draft      Benchmarking for NGFW performance         March 2020


   This section specifies common test equipment configuration parameters
   applicable for all test scenarios defined in Section 7.  Any test
   scenario specific parameters are described under the test setup
   section of each test scenario individually.

4.3.1.  Client Configuration

   This section specifies which parameters SHOULD be considered while
   configuring clients using test equipment.  Also, this section
   specifies the RECOMMENDED values for certain parameters.

4.3.1.1.  TCP Stack Attributes

   The TCP stack SHOULD use a TCP Reno [RFC5681] variant, which include
   congestion avoidance, back off and windowing, fast retransmission,
   and fast recovery on every TCP connection between client and server
   endpoints.  The default IPv4 and IPv6 MSS segments size MUST be set
   to 1460 bytes and 1440 bytes respectively and a TX and RX receive
   windows of 64 KByte.  Client initial congestion window MUST NOT
   exceed 10 times the MSS.  Delayed ACKs are permitted and the maximum
   client delayed Ack MUST NOT exceed 10 times the MSS before a forced
   ACK.  Up to 3 retries SHOULD be allowed before a timeout event is
   declared.  All traffic MUST set the TCP PSH flag to high.  The source
   port range SHOULD be in the range of 1024 - 65535.  Internal timeout
   SHOULD be dynamically scalable per RFC 793.  Client SHOULD initiate
   and close TCP connections.  TCP connections MUST be closed via FIN.

4.3.1.2.  Client IP Address Space

   The sum of the client IP space SHOULD contain the following
   attributes.  The IP blocks SHOULD consist of multiple unique,
   discontinuous static address blocks.  A default gateway is permitted.
   The IPv4 Type of Service (ToS) byte or IPv6 traffic class should be
   set to '00' or '000000' respectively.

   The following equation can be used to determine the required total
   number of client IP addresses.

   Desired total number of client IP = Target throughput [Mbit/s] /
   Throughput per IP address [Mbit/s]

   Based on deployment and use case scenario, the value for "Throughput
   per IP address" can be varied.

   (Option 1)  DUT/SUT deployment scenario 1 : 6-7 Mbit/s per IP (e.g.
               1,400-1,700 IPs per 10Gbit/s throughput)





Balarajah, et al.      Expires September 10, 2020              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Benchmarking for NGFW performance         March 2020


   (Option 2)  DUT/SUT deployment scenario 2 : 0.1-0.2 Mbit/s per IP
               (e.g.  50,000-100,000 IPs per 10Gbit/s throughput)

   Based on deployment and use case scenario, client IP addresses SHOULD
   be distributed between IPv4 and IPv6 type.  The Following options can
   be considered for a selection of traffic mix ratio.

   (Option 1)  100 % IPv4, no IPv6

   (Option 2)  80 % IPv4, 20% IPv6

   (Option 3)  50 % IPv4, 50% IPv6

   (Option 4)  20 % IPv4, 80% IPv6

   (Option 5)  no IPv4, 100% IPv6

4.3.1.3.  Emulated Web Browser Attributes

   The emulated web browser contains attributes that will materially
   affect how traffic is loaded.  The objective is to emulate modern,
   typical browser attributes to improve realism of the result set.

   For HTTP traffic emulation, the emulated browser MUST negotiate HTTP
   1.1.  HTTP persistency MAY be enabled depending on test scenario.
   The browser MAY open multiple TCP connections per Server endpoint IP
   at any time depending on how many sequential transactions are needed
   to be processed.  Within the TCP connection multiple transactions MAY
   be processed if the emulated browser has available connections.  The
   browser SHOULD advertise a User-Agent header.  Headers MUST be sent
   uncompressed.  The browser SHOULD enforce content length validation.

   For encrypted traffic, the following attributes SHALL define the
   negotiated encryption parameters.  The test clients MUST use TLSv1.2
   or higher.  TLS record size MAY be optimized for the HTTPS response
   object size up to a record size of 16 KByte.  The client endpoint
   MUST send TLS Extension Server Name Indication (SNI) information when
   opening a security tunnel.  Each client connection MUST perform a
   full handshake with server certificate and MUST NOT use session reuse
   or resumption.  Cipher suite and key size are defined in the
   parameter section of the specific test scenarios.

4.3.2.  Backend Server Configuration

   This section specifies which parameters should be considered while
   configuring emulated backend servers using test equipment.

Internet-Draft      Benchmarking for NGFW performance         March 2020


4.3.2.1.  TCP Stack Attributes

   The TCP stack on the server side SHOULD be configured similar to the
   client side configuration described in Section 4.3.1.1.  In addition,
   server initial congestion window MUST NOT exceed 10 times the MSS.
   Delayed ACKs are permitted and the maximum server delayed ACK MUST
   NOT exceed 10 times the MSS before a forced ACK.

4.3.2.2.  Server Endpoint IP Addressing

   The server IP blocks SHOULD consist of unique, discontinuous static
   address blocks with one IP per Server Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN) endpoint per test port.  The IPv4 ToS byte and IPv6 traffic
   class bytes should be set to '00' and '000000' respectively.

4.3.2.3.  HTTP / HTTPS Server Pool Endpoint Attributes

   The server pool for HTTP SHOULD listen on TCP port 80 and emulate
   HTTP version 1.1 with persistence.  The Server MUST advertise server
   type in the Server response header [RFC2616].  For HTTPS server, TLS
   1.2 or higher MUST be used with a maximum record size of 16 KByte and
   MUST NOT use ticket resumption or Session ID reuse . The server MUST
   listen on port TCP 443.  The server SHALL serve a certificate to the
   client.  It is REQUIRED that the HTTPS server also check Host SNI
   information with the FQDN.  Cipher suite and key size are defined in
   the parameter section of the specific test scenarios.

4.3.3.  Traffic Flow Definition

   This section describes the traffic pattern between client and server
   endpoints.  At the beginning of the test, the server endpoint
   initializes and will be ready to accept connection states including
   initialization of the TCP stack as well as bound HTTP and HTTPS
   servers.  When a client endpoint is needed, it will initialize and be
   given attributes such as a MAC and IP address.  The behavior of the
   client is to sweep though the given server IP space, sequentially
   generating a recognizable service by the DUT.  Thus, a balanced, mesh
   between client endpoints and server endpoints will be generated in a
   client port server port combination.  Each client endpoint performs
   the same actions as other endpoints, with the difference being the
   source IP of the client endpoint and the target server IP pool.  The
   client SHALL use Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in Host Headers
   and for TLS Server Name Indication (SNI).

4.3.3.1.  Description of Intra-Client Behavior

   Client endpoints are independent of other clients that are
   concurrently executing.  When a client endpoint initiates traffic,
   this section describes how the client steps though different
   services.  Once the test is initialized, the client endpoints SHOULD
   randomly hold (perform no operation) for a few milliseconds to allow
   for better randomization of start of client traffic.  Each client
   will either open a new TCP connection or connect to a TCP persistence
   stack still open to that specific server.  At any point that the
   service profile may require encryption, a TLS encryption tunnel will
   form presenting the URL request to the server.  The server will then
   perform an SNI name check with the proposed FQDN compared to the
   domain embedded in the certificate.  Only when correct, will the
   server process the HTTPS response object.  The initial response
   object to the server MUST NOT have a fixed size; its size is based on
   benchmarking tests described in Section 7.  Multiple additional sub-
   URLs (response objects on the service page) MAY be requested
   simultaneously.  This MAY be to the same server IP as the initial
   URL.  Each sub-object will also use a conical FQDN and URL path, as
   observed in the traffic mix used.

4.3.4.  Traffic Load Profile

   The loading of traffic is described in this section.  The loading of
   a traffic load profile has five distinct phases: Init, ramp up,
   sustain, ramp down, and collection.

   1.  During the Init phase, test bed devices including the client and
       server endpoints should negotiate layer 2-3 connectivity such as
       MAC learning and ARP.  Only after successful MAC learning or ARP/
       ND resolution SHALL the test iteration move to the next phase.
       No measurements are made in this phase.  The minimum RECOMMEND
       time for Init phase is 5 seconds.  During this phase, the
       emulated clients SHOULD NOT initiate any sessions with the DUT/
       SUT, in contrast, the emulated servers should be ready to accept
       requests from DUT/SUT or from emulated clients.

   2.  In the ramp up phase, the test equipment SHOULD start to generate
       the test traffic.  It SHOULD use a set approximate number of
       unique client IP addresses actively to generate traffic.  The
       traffic SHOULD ramp from zero to desired target objective.  The
       target objective will be defined for each benchmarking test.  The
       duration for the ramp up phase MUST be configured long enough, so
       that the test equipment does not overwhelm DUT/SUT's supported
       performance metrics namely; connections per second, throughput,
       concurrent TCP connections, and application transactions per
       second.  No measurements are made in this phase.

Internet-Draft      Benchmarking for NGFW performance         March 2020


   3.  In the sustain phase, the test equipment SHOULD continue
       generating traffic to constant target value for a constant number
       of active client IPs.  The mininum RECOMMENDED time duration for
       sustain phase is 300 seconds.  This is the phase where
       measurements occur.

   4.  In the ramp down/close phase, no new connections are established,
       and no measurements are made.  The time duration for ramp up and
       ramp down phase SHOULD be same.

   5.  The last phase is administrative and will occur when the test
       equipment merges and collates the report data.

5.  Test Bed Considerations

   This section recommends steps to control the test environment and
   test equipment, specifically focusing on virtualized environments and
   virtualized test equipment.

   1.  Ensure that any ancillary switching or routing functions between
       the system under test and the test equipment do not limit the
       performance of the traffic generator.  This is specifically
       important for virtualized components (vSwitches, vRouters).

   2.  Verify that the performance of the test equipment matches and
       reasonably exceeds the expected maximum performance of the system
       under test.

   3.  Assert that the test bed characteristics are stable during the
       entire test session.  Several factors might influence stability
       specifically for virtualized test beds.  For example additional
       workloads in a virtualized system, load balancing and movement of
       virtual machines during the test, or simple issues such as
       additional heat created by high workloads leading to an emergency
       CPU performance reduction.

   Test bed reference pre-tests help to ensure that the maximum desired
   traffic generator aspects such as throughput, transaction per second,
   connection per second, concurrent connection and latency.

   Once the desired maximum performance goals for the system under test
   have been identified, a safety margin of 10% SHOULD be added for
   throughput and subtracted for maximum latency and maximum packet
   loss.

   Test bed preparation may be performed either by configuring the DUT
   in the most trivial setup (fast forwarding) or without presence of
   DUT.

6.  Reporting

   This section describes how the final report should be formatted and
   presented.  The final test report MAY have two major sections;
   Introduction and result sections.  The following attributes SHOULD be
   present in the introduction section of the test report.

   1.  The name of the NetSecOPEN traffic mix (see Appendix A) MUST be
       prominent.

   2.  The time and date of the execution of the test MUST be prominent.

   3.  Summary of testbed software and Hardware details

   4.  Results Summary / Executive Summary

       1.  Results SHOULD resemble a pyramid in how it is reported, with
           the introduction section documenting the summary of results
           in a prominent, easy to read block.

       2.  In the result section of the test report, the following
           attributes should be present for each test scenario.

           a.  KPIs MUST be documented separately for each test
               scenario.  The format of the KPI metrics should be
               presented as described in Section 6.1.

           b.  The next level of details SHOULD be graphs showing each
               of these metrics over the duration (sustain phase) of the
               test.  This allows the user to see the measured
               performance stability changes over time.

6.1.  Key Performance Indicators

   This section lists KPIs for overall benchmarking tests scenarios.
   All KPIs MUST be measured during the sustain phase of the traffic
   load profile described in Section 4.3.4.  All KPIs MUST be measured
   from the result output of test equipment.

   o  Concurrent TCP Connections
      This key performance indicator measures the average concurrent
      open TCP connections in the sustaining period.

   o  TCP Connections Per Second
      This key performance indicator measures the average established
      TCP connections per second in the sustaining period.  For "TCP/
      HTTP(S) Connection Per Second" benchmarking test scenario, the KPI
      is measured average established and terminated TCP connections per
      second simultaneously.

   o  Application Transactions Per Second

Internet-Draft      Benchmarking for NGFW performance         March 2020


      This key performance indicator measures the average successfully
      completed application transactions per second in the sustaining
      period.

   o  TLS Handshake Rate
      This key performance indicator measures the average TLS 1.2 or
      higher session formation rate within the sustaining period.

   o  Throughput
      This key performance indicator measures the average Layer 2
      throughput within the sustaining period as well as average packets
      per seconds within the same period.  The value of throughput
      SHOULD be presented in Gbit/s rounded to two places of precision
      with a more specific Kbit/s in parenthesis.  Optionally, goodput
      MAY also be logged as an average goodput rate measured over the
      same period.  Goodput result SHALL also be presented in the same
      format as throughput.

   o  URL Response time / Time to Last Byte (TTLB)
      This key performance indicator measures the minimum, average and
      maximum per URL response time in the sustaining period.  The
      latency is measured at Client and in this case would be the time
      duration between sending a GET request from Client and the
      receival of the complete response from the server.

   o  Time to First Byte (TTFB)
      This key performance indicator will measure minimum, average and
      maximum the time to first byte.  TTFB is the elapsed time between
      sending the SYN packet from the client and receiving the first
      byte of application date from the DUT/SUT.  TTFB SHOULD be
      expressed in millisecond.

7.  Benchmarking Tests

7.1.  Throughput Performance With NetSecOPEN Traffic Mix

7.1.1.  Objective

   traffic load profile definition as described in Section 4.3.4.  The
   DUT/SUT SHOULD reach the "Initial throughput" during the sustain
   phase.  Measure all KPI as defined in Section 7.1.3.5.  The measured
   KPIs during the sustain phase MUST meet validation criteria "a" and

   The DUT/SUT is expected to reach the desired target throughput during
   the sustain phase.  In addition, the measured KPIs MUST meet all
   validation criteria.  Follow step 3, if the KPI metrics do not meet
   the validation criteria.

   transactions per second MUST NOT reach to the maximum value the DUT/
   SUT can support.  The test results for specific test iterations
   SHOULD NOT be reported, if the above mentioned KPI (especially

   iteration with 64 KByte of HTTP response object size reached the
   maximum throughput limitation of the DUT, the test iteration MAY be
   interrupted and the result for 64 KByte SHOULD NOT be reported).

   The test equipment SHOULD start to measure and record all specified

   Following KPI metrics MUST be reported for each test scenario and
   HTTP response object sizes separately:

   TTFB (minimum, average and maximum) and TTLB (minimum, average and
   maximum)

   All KPI's are measured once the target throughput achieves the steady
   state.

7.4.4.  Test Procedures and Expected Results

   The test procedure is designed to measure the average application
   transaction latencies or TTLB when the DUT is operating close to 50%

   phase.  The measured KPIs during the sustain phase MUST meet the
   validation criteria a, b, c, d, e and f defined in Section 7.4.3.3.

   the parameters table.  The test equipment SHOULD follow the traffic
   load profile definition as described in Section 4.3.4.

   During the ramp up and sustain phase, other KPIs such as throughput,
   concurrent TCP connections and application transactions per second
   MUST NOT reach to the maximum value that the DUT/SUT can support.
   The test results for specific test iterations SHOULD NOT be reported,
   if the above mentioned KPI (especially throughput) reaches to the
   maximum value.  (Example: If the test iteration with 64 KByte of HTTP
   response object size reached the maximum throughput limitation of the
   DUT, the test iteration MAY be interrupted and the result for 64
   KByte SHOULD NOT be reported).

   The test equipment SHOULD start to measure and record all specified
   KPIs.  The frequency of measurement SHOULD be 2 seconds.  Continue
   the test until all traffic profile phases are completed.  DUT/SUT is
   expected to reach the desired "Target objective" at the sustain
   phase.  In addition, the measured KPIs MUST meet all validation
   criteria.

   Follow step 3, if the KPI metrics do not meet the validation

   The client MUST negotiate HTTP 1.1 with persistence and each client
   MAY open multiple concurrent TCP connections per server endpoint IP.

   Each client sends 10 GET commands requesting 1 KByte HTTP response
   object in the same TCP connection (10 transactions/TCP connection)
   and the delay (think time) between the transaction MUST be X seconds.

   X = ("Ramp up time" + "steady state time") /10

   The established connections SHOULD remain open until the ramp down
   phase of the test.  During the ramp down phase, all connections
   SHOULD be successfully closed with FIN.

       response code other than 200 OK) MUST be less than 0.001% (1 out
       of 100,000 transaction) of total attempted transactions

   b.  Number of Terminated TCP connections due to unexpected TCP RST
       sent by DUT/SUT MUST be less than 0.001% (1 out of 100,000

7.6.4.  Test Procedures and expected Results

   The test procedure is designed to measure the TCP connections per
   second rate of the DUT/SUT at the sustaining period of traffic load
   profile.  The test procedure consists of three major steps.  This
   test procedure MAY be repeated multiple times with different IPv4 and
   IPv6 traffic distribution.

7.6.4.1.  Step 1: Test Initialization and Qualification

   traffic load profile CAN be defined as described in Section 4.3.4.

   The DUT/SUT SHOULD reach the "Initial connections per second" before
   the sustain phase.  The measured KPIs during the sustain phase MUST
   meet the validation criteria a, b, c, and d defined in
   Section 7.6.3.3.

   If the KPI metrics do not meet the validation criteria, the test
   procedure MUST NOT be continued to "Step 2".

   During the ramp up and sustain phase, other KPIs such as throughput,
   concurrent TCP connections and application transactions per second
   MUST NOT reach the maximum value that the DUT/SUT can support.  The
   test results for specific test iteration SHOULD NOT be reported, if
   the above mentioned KPI (especially throughput) reaches the maximum
   value.  (Example: If the test iteration with 64 KByte of HTTPS
   response object size reached the maximum throughput limitation of the
   DUT, the test iteration can be interrupted and the result for 64
   KByte SHOULD NOT be reported).

   The test equipment SHOULD start to measure and record all specified
   KPIs.  The frequency of measurement SHOULD be 2 seconds.  Continue
   the test until all traffic profile phases are completed.

   The DUT/SUT is expected to reach the desired target connections per
   second rate at the sustain phase.  In addition, the measured KPIs
   must meet all validation criteria.

   second measured in test scenario TCP/HTTPS Connections per second
   (Section 7.6)

   Target objective for scenario 2: 50% of the maximum throughput

       response code other than 200 OK) MUST be less than 0.001% (1 out
       of 100,000 transactions) of attempt transactions.

   b.  Number of Terminated TCP connections due to unexpected TCP RST
       sent by DUT/SUT MUST be less than 0.001% (1 out of 100,000
       connections) of total initiated TCP connections

   c.  During the sustain phase, traffic should be forwarded at a
       constant rate.

   d.  Concurrent TCP connections MUST be constant during steady state
       and any deviation of concurrent TCP connections SHOULD be less
       than 10%. This confirms the DUT opens and closes TCP connections
       almost at the same rate

   e.  After ramp up the DUT MUST achieve the "Target objective" defined
       in the parameter Section 7.8.3.2 and remain in that state for the
       entire test duration (sustain phase).

7.8.3.4.  Measurement

   Following KPI metrics MUST be reported for each test scenario and
   HTTPS response object sizes separately:

   TTFB (minimum, average and maximum) and TTLB (minimum, average and
   maximum)

   All KPI's are measured once the target connections per second
   achieves the steady state.

7.8.4.  Test Procedures and Expected Results

   The test procedure is designed to measure average TTFB or TTLB when
   the DUT is operating close to 50% of its maximum achievable
   connections per second.  This test procedure can be repeated multiple
   times with different IP types (IPv4 only, IPv6 only and IPv4 and IPv6
   mixed traffic distribution), HTTPS response object sizes and single
   and multiple transactions per connection scenarios.

7.8.4.1.  Step 1: Test Initialization and Qualification

   Verify the link status of the all connected physical interfaces.  All
   interfaces are expected to be in "UP" status.

   Configure traffic load profile of the test equipment to establish
   "Initial objective" as defined in the parameters Section 7.8.3.2.
   The traffic load profile can be defined as described in
   Section 4.3.4.

   The DUT/SUT SHOULD reach the "Initial objective" before the sustain
   phase.  The measured KPIs during the sustain phase MUST meet the
   validation criteria a, b, c, d, e and f defined in Section 7.8.3.3.

   If the KPI metrics do not meet the validation criteria, the test
   procedure MUST NOT be continued to "Step 2".

7.8.4.2.  Step 2: Test Run with Target Objective

   Configure test equipment to establish "Target objective" defined in
   the parameters table.  The test equipment SHOULD follow the traffic
   load profile definition as described in Section 4.3.4.

   During the ramp up and sustain phase, other KPIs such as throughput,
   concurrent TCP connections and application transactions per second
   MUST NOT reach to the maximum value that the DUT/SUT can support.
   The test results for specific test iterations SHOULD NOT be reported,
   if the above mentioned KPI (especially throughput) reaches to the
   maximum value.  (Example: If the test iteration with 64 KByte of HTTP
   response object size reached the maximum throughput limitation of the
   DUT, the test iteration MAY be interrupted and the result for 64
   KByte SHOULD NOT be reported).

   The test equipment SHOULD start to measure and record all specified
   KPIs.  The frequency of measurement SHOULD be 2 seconds.  Continue
   the test until all traffic profile phases are completed.  DUT/SUT is
   expected to reach the desired "Target objective" at the sustain
   phase.  In addition, the measured KPIs MUST meet all validation
   criteria.

   Follow step 3, if the KPI metrics do not meet the validation
   criteria.

7.8.4.3.  Step 3: Test Iteration

   Determine the maximum achievable connections per second within the
   validation criteria and measure the latency values.

7.9.  Concurrent TCP/HTTPS Connection Capacity

7.9.1.  Objective

   Determine the maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that the
   DUT/SUT sustains when using HTTPS traffic.

7.9.2.  Test Setup

   Test bed setup SHOULD be configured as defined in Section 4.  Any
   specific test bed configuration changes such as number of interfaces
   and interface type, etc.  MUST be documented.

7.9.3.  Test Parameters

   In this section, test scenario specific parameters SHOULD be defined.

7.9.3.1.  DUT/SUT Configuration Parameters

   DUT/SUT parameters MUST conform to the requirements defined in
   Section 4.2.  Any configuration changes for this specific test
   scenario MUST be documented.

7.9.3.2.  Test Equipment Configuration Parameters

   Test equipment configuration parameters MUST conform to the
   requirements defined in Section 4.3.  Following parameters MUST be
   documented for this test scenario:

      Client IP address range defined in Section 4.3.1.2

      Server IP address range defined in Section 4.3.2.2

      Traffic distribution ratio between IPv4 and IPv6 defined in
      Section 4.3.1.2

      RECOMMENDED cipher suites and key size: ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-
      SHA384 with Secp521 bits key size (Signature Hash Algorithm:
      ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384 and Supported group: sepc521r1)

      Target concurrent connections: Initial value from product data
      sheet (if known)

      Initial concurrent connections: 10% of "Target concurrent
      connections" (an optional parameter for documentation)

      Connections per second during ramp up phase: 50% of maximum
      connections per second measured in test scenario TCP/HTTPS
      Connections per second (Section 7.6)

      Ramp up time (in traffic load profile for "Target concurrent
      connections"): "Target concurrent connections" / "Maximum
      connections per second during ramp up phase"

      Ramp up time (in traffic load profile for "Initial concurrent
      connections"): "Initial concurrent connections" / "Maximum
      connections per second during ramp up phase"

   The client MUST perform HTTPS transaction with persistence and each
   client can open multiple concurrent TCP connections per server
   endpoint IP.

   Each client sends 10 GET commands requesting 1 KByte HTTPS response
   objects in the same TCP connections (10 transactions/TCP connection)
   and the delay (think time) between each transactions MUST be X
   seconds.

   X = ("Ramp up time" + "steady state time") /10

   The established connections SHOULD remain open until the ramp down
   phase of the test.  During the ramp down phase, all connections
   SHOULD be successfully closed with FIN.

7.9.3.3.  Test Results Validation Criteria

   The following test Criteria is defined as test results validation
   criteria.  Test results validation criteria MUST be monitored during
   the whole sustain phase of the traffic load profile.

   a.  Number of failed Application transactions (receiving any HTTP
       response code other than 200 OK) MUST be less than 0.001% (1 out
       of 100,000 transactions) of total attempted transactions

   b.  Number of Terminated TCP connections due to unexpected TCP RST
       sent by DUT/SUT MUST be less than 0.001% (1 out of 100,000
       connections) of total initiated TCP connections

   c.  During the sustain phase, traffic SHOULD be forwarded constantly

7.9.3.4.  Measurement

   Following KPI metric MUST be reported for this test scenario:

   average Concurrent TCP Connections

7.9.4.  Test Procedures and expected Results

   The test procedure is designed to measure the concurrent TCP
   connection capacity of the DUT/SUT at the sustaining period of
   traffic load profile.  The test procedure consists of three major
   steps.  This test procedure MAY be repeated multiple times with
   different IPv4 and IPv6 traffic distribution.

7.9.4.1.  Step 1: Test Initialization and Qualification

   Verify the link status of all connected physical interfaces.  All
   interfaces are expected to be in "UP" status.

   Configure test equipment to establish "initial concurrent TCP
   connections" defined in Section 7.9.3.2.  Except ramp up time, the
   traffic load profile SHOULD be defined as described in Section 4.3.4.

   During the sustain phase, the DUT/SUT SHOULD reach the "Initial
   concurrent TCP connections".  The measured KPIs during the sustain
   phase MUST meet the validation criteria "a" and "b" defined in
   Section 7.9.3.3.

   If the KPI metrics do not meet the validation criteria, the test
   procedure MUST NOT be continued to "Step 2".

7.9.4.2.  Step 2: Test Run with Target Objective

   Configure test equipment to establish "Target concurrent TCP
   connections".  The test equipment SHOULD follow the traffic load
   profile definition (except ramp up time) as described in
   Section 4.3.4.

   During the ramp up and sustain phase, the other KPIs such as
   throughput, TCP connections per second and application transactions
   per second MUST NOT reach to the maximum value that the DUT/SUT can
   support.

   The test equipment SHOULD start to measure and record KPIs defined in
   Section 7.9.3.4.  The frequency of measurement SHOULD be 2 seconds.
   Continue the test until all traffic profile phases are completed.

   The DUT/SUT is expected to reach the desired target concurrent
   connections at the sustain phase.  In addition, the measured KPIs
   MUST meet all validation criteria.

   Follow step 3, if the KPI metrics do not meet the validation
   criteria.

7.9.4.3.  Step 3: Test Iteration

   Determine the maximum and average achievable concurrent TCP
   connections within the validation criteria.

10.  Security Considerations

   The primary goal of this document is to provide benchmarking
   terminology and methodology for next-generation network security
   devices.  However, readers should be aware that there is some overlap
   between performance and security issues.  Specifically, the optimal
   configuration for network security device performance may not be the
   most secure, and vice-versa.  The Cipher suites recommended in this
   document are just for test purpose only.  The Cipher suite
   recommendation for a real deployment is outside the scope of this
   document.

Appendix A.  NetSecOPEN Basic Traffic Mix

   A traffic mix for testing performance of next generation firewalls
   MUST scale to stress the DUT based on real-world conditions.  In
   order to achieve this the following MUST be included:

   o  Clients connecting to multiple different server FQDNs per
      application

   o  Clients loading apps and pages with connections and objects in
      specific orders

   o  Multiple unique certificates for HTTPS/TLS

   o  A wide variety of different object sizes

   o  Different URL paths

   o  Mix of HTTP and HTTPS

   A traffic mix for testing performance of next generation firewalls
   MUST also facilitate application identification using different
   detection methods with and without decryption of the traffic.  Such
   as:

   o  HTTP HOST based application detection

   o  HTTPS/TLS Server Name Indication (SNI)

   o  Certificate Subject Common Name (CN)

   The mix MUST be of sufficient complexity and volume to render
   differences in individual apps as statistically insignificant.  For
   example, changes in like to like apps - such as one type of video
   service vs. another both consist of larger objects whereas one news
   site vs. another both typically have more connections then other apps
   because of trackers and embedded advertising content.  To achieve
   sufficient complexity, a mix MUST have:

   o  Thousands of URLs each client walks thru

   o  Hundreds of FQDNs each client connects to

   o  Hundreds of unique certificates for HTTPS/TLS

   o  Thousands of different object sizes per client in orders matching
      applications

   The following is a description of what a popular application in an
   enterprise traffic mix contains.

   Table 5 lists the FQDNs, number of transactions and bytes transferred
   as an example, client interactions with Office 365 Outlook, Word,
   Excel, PowerPoint, SharePoint and Skype.

   Clients MUST connect to multiple server FQDNs in the same order as
   real applications.  Connections MUST be made when the client is
   interacting with the application and MUST NOT first setup up all
   connections.  Connections SHOULD stay open per client for subsequent
   transactions to the same FQDN similar to how a web browser behaves.
   Clients MUST use different URL Paths and Object sizes in orders as
   they are observed in real Applications.  Clients MAY also setup
   multiple connections per FQDN to process multiple transactions in a
   sequence at the same time.  Table 6 has a partial example sequence of
   the Office 365 Word application transactions.

   For application identification the HTTPS/TLS traffic MUST include
   realistic Certificate Subject Common Name (CN) data as well as Server
   Name Indications (SNI).  For example, a DUT MAY detect Facebook Chat
   traffic by inspecting the certificate and detecting *.facebook.com in
   the certificate subject CN and subsequently detect the word chat in
   the FQDN 5-edge-chat.facebook.com and identify traffic on the
   connection to be Facebook Chat.

   Table 7 includes further examples in SNI and CN pairs for several
   FQDNs of Office 365.

               Table 7: Office365 SNI and CN Pairs Examples

   NetSecOPEN has provided a reference enterprise perimeter traffic mix
   with dozens of applications, hundreds of connections, and thousands
   of transactions.

   The enterprise perimeter traffic mix consists of 70% HTTPS and 30%
   HTTP by Bytes, 58% HTTPS and 42% HTTP by Transactions.  By
   connections with a single connection per FQDN the mix consists of 43%
   HTTPS and 57% HTTP.  With multiple connections per FQDN the HTTPS
   percentage is higher.

   Table 8 is a summary of the NetSecOPEN enterprise perimeter traffic
   mix sorted by bytes with unique FQDNs and transactions per
   applications.
