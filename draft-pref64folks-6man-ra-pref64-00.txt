1.  Introduction

   NAT64 [RFC6146] with DNS64 [RFC6147] is a widely-deployed mechanism
   to provide IPv4 access on IPv6-only networks.  In order to support
   functions such as local validation of DNSSEC [RFC4033] responses,
   464xlat [RFC6877], and local IPv4 address synthesis [RFC8305], the
   host must be aware of the NAT64 prefix in use by the network.  This
   document specifies a Router Advertisement [RFC4861] option to
   communicate the NAT64 prefix to hosts.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Why include the NAT64 prefix in Router Advertisements

   Fate sharing.  NAT64 requires a routing to be configured.  IPv6
   routing configuration requires receiving an IPv6 Router Advertisement
   [RFC4861].  Compared to currently-deployed NAT64 prefix discovery
   methods such as [RFC7050], including the NAT64 prefix in the Router
   Advertisement minimizes the number of packets required to configure a
   host.  This speeds up the process of connecting to a network that
   supports NAT64/DNS64, and simplifies host implementation by removing
   the possibility that the a can have an incomplete layer 3
   configuration (e.g., IPv6 addresses and prefixes, but no NAT64
   prefix).

   Deployability.  All IPv6 hosts and networks are required to support
   [RFC4861].  Other options such as [RFC7225]b require implementing
   other protocols.

3.  Semantics

   This option specifies exactly one NAT64 prefix for all IPv4
   addresses.  Observation of current deployments suggest that they use
   RFC7050, which also only supports one prefix.

   This option only supports the NAT64 prefix length of 96 bits.  In the
   unlikely event of use cases for shorter prefixes ([RFC6052]) emerging
   another option could be created.

   Fields:

   Type     8-bit identifier of the RDNSS option type as assigned by
            IANA: TBD
   Length   8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including
            the Type and Length fields) is in units of 8 octets. The
            only valid value for this filed is 2. A host MUST ignore the
            NAT64 prefix option if the length field value is not set to
            2.
   Lifetime 16-bit unsigned integer.  The maximum time in seconds over
            which this NAT64 prefix MAY be used. The value of Lifetime
            SHOULD by default be set to lesser of  3 x MaxRtrAdvInterval
            or 65535 seconds.  A value of zero means that the prefix
            MUST no longer be used.
   Prefix   The highest 96-bits of the NAT64 prefix.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
   type for the PREF64 option defined in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   Because Router Advertisements are required in all IPv6 configuration
   scenarios, on IPv6-only networks, Router Advertisements must already
   be secured, e.g., by deploying RA guard [RFC6105].  Providing all
   configuration in Router Advertisements increases security by ensuring
   that no other protocols can be abused by malicious attackers to
   provide hosts with invalid configuration.

   The security measures that must already be in place to ensure that
   Router Advertisements are only received from legitimate sources
   eliminate the problem of PREF64 validation described in section 3.1
   of [RFC7050].
