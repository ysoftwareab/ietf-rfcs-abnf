                        IPv6 Data Plane (SRv6)
                   draft-ali-spring-srv6-pm-00.txt 

Abstract

   RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and
   accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as
   well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel
   throughput in MPLS networks.  This document describes how these
   mechanisms can be used for performance measurement in Segment Routing
   with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Performance Measurement     February 14, 2018


1.  Introduction

   Service provider's ability to satisfy Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
   depend on the ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for
   packet loss and one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics
   such as delay variation and channel throughput.  The ability to
   monitor these performance metrics also provides operators with
   greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their
   networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network
   performance evaluation.  

   [RFC6374] specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of these performance metrics in MPLS networks. 
   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks.  However, mechanisms in [RFC6374] are more
   suitable for Segment Routing when using MPLS data plane
   [I-D.spring-sr-mpls-pm].  This document describes how these
   mechanisms can be used for Performance Measurement (PM) in Segment
   Routing with the IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.

    |                          --------                        |

                               ------

                    Figure 1: Reference Topology

   In the reference topology in Figure 1:

   Nodes N1, N2, and N4 are SRv6 capable nodes.

   Nodes N3, N5 and N6 are classic IPv6 nodes.

   Node 100 is a controller.

   Node Nk has a classic IPv6 loopback address Bk::/128

   Node Nk has Ak::/48 for its local SID space from which Local SIDs are
   explicitly allocated.

   The IPv6 address of the nth Link between node X and Y at the X side
   is represented as 99:X:Y::Xn. e.g., the IPv6 address of link6 (the
   2nd link) between N3 and N4 at N3 in Figure 1 is 99:3:4:32. 
   Similarly, the IPv6 address of link5 (the 1st link between N3 and N4)
   at node 3 is 99:3:4::31.

   Ak::0 is explicitly allocated as the END function at Node k.

   Ak::Cij is explicitly allocated as the END.X function at node k
   towards neighbor node i via jth Link between node i and node j. e.g.,

   A2::C31 represents END.X at N2 towards N3 via link3 (the 1st link
   between N2 and N3).  Similarly, A4::C52 represents the END.X at N4
   towards N5 via link10.

   <S1, S2, S3> represents a SID list where S1 is the first SID and S3
   is the last SID.  (S3, S2, S1; SL) represents the same SID list but
   encoded in the SRH format where the rightmost SID (S1) in the SRH is
   the first SID and the leftmost SID (S3) in the SRH is the last SID.

   (SA, DA) (S3, S2, S1; SL) represents an IPv6 packet, SA is the IPv6
   source address, DA the IPv6 destination address, (S3, S2, S1; SL) is
   the SRH header that includes the SID list <S1, S2, S3>.

   SR policy is defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy].


3.  Performance Delay Measurement 

3.1.  One-Way Delay Measurement

   The one-way delay measurement for Packet IP network is defined in
   [RFC7679].  It is further exemplified using the following Figure 2.

                                           ------
                                           |N100|
                                           |    |
                                           ------
                                              ^
                                              | Response Option-2
                     T1                T2     |
           +-------+/     Query         \+-------+
           |       | - - - - - - - - - ->|       |
           |   N1  |=====================|   N4  |
           |       |<- - - - - - - - - - |       |
           +-------+\ Response Option-1 /+-------+
                    T4                 T3

            Figure 2: Delay Measurement Reference Model


   Nodes N1 and N4 may not be directly connected, as shown in the
   reference topology in Figure 1.  When N1 and N4 are not directly
   connected, the one-way delay measurement reflects the delay observed
   by the packet over an arbitrary SRv6 segment-list (policy)
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy].  In other words, the one-way
   delay is associated with the forward (N1 to N4) direction of the SRv6
   segment-list.

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Performance Measurement     February 14, 2018


   The delay measurement can be performed using Active (using synthetic
   probe) mode and Passive (using data stream aka in-band) mode.  In
   both modes, T1 refers to the time the packet is transmitted from N1. 
   Timestamp is added as late as possible at the egress pipeline (in
   hardware) at node N1.  T2 refers to the time the packet is received
   at N2.  Timestamp at the receiver (N2) is added as soon as possible
   at the ingress pipeline (in hardware).

   The one-way delay metric can be computed as follow [RFC7679],
   [RFC6374],

      One-way delay = T2 - T1

   Clock synchronization on the querier and responder nodes using the
   methods detailed in [RFC6374] is required.

   Note that for one-way delay measurement, the receiver (node N4 in
   Figure 2) may send a response to the sender or to a controller (N100
   in Figure 2).  The controller may also request the querier (node N1
   in Figure 2) to initiate delay measurement (this messaging is not
   shown in Figure 2 and is beyond the scope of this document).

3.2.  Two-Way Delay Measurement

   [RFC6374], Section 3.4 defines timestamp format that can be used for
   delay measurement.  The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
   timestamp format [IEEE1588] is used by default as described in
   Appendix A of [RFC6374], but it may require hardware support.

   Note that for one-way delay measurement, Clock synchronization
   between the querier and responder nodes using methods detailed in
   [RFC6374] is required.  Two-way delay measurement does not require
   clock to be synchronized between the querier and responder nodes.

3.3.  Delay Measurement Message Format

   [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header] defines Segment Routing Header
   (SRH) for SRv6.  SRH can contain TLVs, as specified in
   [I-D.6man-segment-routing-header].  This document specifies Delay
   Measurement (DM) TLV that is carried in SRH for both one-way and two-
   way delay measurement.  The DM TLV uses a modified DM message format
   specified in [RFC6374] and is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   fields is designed to ensure that transmit timestamps are always
   written at the same fixed offset in the packet, and likewise for
   receive timestamps.  This property is important for hardware
   processing.

   SUB-TLV Block: Zero or more TLV fields.  This document assumes the
   use of the DM message TLVs defined in [RFC6374].


3.3.1.  Timestamping

   [RFC6374], Section 3.4 defines timestamp format that can be used for
   delay measurement.  The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
   timestamp format [IEEE1588] is used by default as described in
   Appendix A of [RFC6374], but it may require hardware support.  As an
   alternative, Network Time Protocol (NTP) timestamp format is also
   supported in [RFC6374].

   Note that for one-way delay measurement, Clock synchronization
   between the querier and responder nodes using methods detailed in
   [RFC6374] is required.  Two-way delay measurement does not require

   clock to be synchronized between the querier and responder nodes.


3.4.  One-Way Delay Measurement using Synthetic Probes

   For delay measurement using synthetic probes, a DM TLV is inserted in
   the SRH to record the timestamps and END.OTP SID as described in the
   pseudo code in [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming] are used to punt
   the probe packets.

3.4.1.  Example Procedure

   To measure one-way delay from node N1 over an SRv6 Policy
   [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] that goes through a segment-list
   <A2::C31, A4::C52> to node N4, the following procedure is followed:

   o  Node N1 constructs a DM probe packet with (B1::0,
      A2::C31)(A4::C52, A2::C31, SL=1; NH=NONE, DM TLV).  To punt the DM
      probe packet at node N4, node N1 inserts the END.OTP SID
      [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming] just before the target SID
      A4::C52 in the SRH.  Thus, the packet as it leaves node N1 looks
      like (B1::0, A2::C31)(A4::C52, A4::OTP, A2::C31; SL=2; NH=NONE, DM
      TLV (with T1 from N1)).  The PM synthetic probe query message does
      not contain any payload data.

   o  When node N4 receives the packet (B1::0, A4::OTP)(A4::C52,
      A4::OTP, A2::C31; SL=1; NH=NONE, DM TLV), it processes the END.OTP
      SID, as described in the pseudo code in
      [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming].  In doing so, it punts the
      timestamped packet (with T2 from N4) to the Performance
      Measurement (PM) process in control plane for processing.

3.5.  In-band One-Way Segment-by-Segment Delay Measurement

   For delay measurement for in-band with data traffic, a DM TLV in the
   SRH to record timestamps and O-bit as described in
   [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming] to punt a copy of the packet on
   every SRv6 nodes are used.

3.5.1.  Example Procedure

   Consider the case where the user wants to measure one-way delay from
   node N1 over an SRv6 Policy [I-D.spring-segment-routing-policy] that
   goes through a segment-list <A2::C31, A4::C52>.  However, the user
   desired to measure delay in-band with data traffic on a
   segment-by-segment basis.

   o  To force a punt of the timestamped copy of the data packet at node

      N2 and node N4, node N1 sets the O-bit in SRH at locally
      configured periodic measurement interval.  The packet, as it
      leaves node 1, looks like (B1::0, A2::C31)(A4::C52, A2::C31; SL=1,
      Flags.O=1, DM TLV (with T1 from N1), NH=data payload type)(data
      payload).  Here, the data payload refers to the actual data
      traffic going over the policy whose performance is being measured.
       Node N1 may optionally punt a timestamped copy of the packet with
      T1 to the local PM process in control plane.

   o  When node N2 receives the packet (B1::0, A2::C31)(A4::C52,
      A2::C31; SL=1, Flags.O=1, DM TLV, NH=data payload type)(data
      payload) packet, it processes the O-bit in SRH, as described in
      the pseudo code in [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming].  A
      timestamped copy of the packet gets punted to the PM process in
      control plane for processing.  Node N2 continues to apply the
      A2::C31 SID function on the original packet and forwards it,
      accordingly.  As SRH.Flags.O=1, Node N2 also disables the PSP
      behavior, i.e., does not remove the SRH.

   o  The PM process in control plane at node N2 sends the copy of the
      timestamped packet (with DM TLV containing T1 from N1 and T2 from
      N2) to a locally configured controller or to the querier.  Please
      note that, as mentioned in [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming],
      if node N2 does not support the O-bit, it simply ignores it and
      processes the local SID, A2::C31.  In this case, the controller
      will not get the performance data from the segments with the nodes
      that do not support the O-bit.

   o  When node N4 receives the packet (B1::0, A4::C52)(A4::C52,
      A2::C31; SL=0, Flags.O=1, DM TLV (containing T1 from N1); NH=data
      payload type)(data payload), it processes the O-bit in SRH, as
      described in the pseudo code in
      [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming].  A timestamped copy of the
      packet gets punted to the PM process in control plane for
      processing.

   o  The PM process in control plane at node N2 sends the copy of the
      timestamped packet (with DM TLV containing T1 from N1 and T2 from
      N4) to a locally configured controller.

   The controller processes the timestamped packet from each segment and
   computes the segment-by-segment one-way delay.  

3.5.2.  Node Capability

   Support for O-bit is part of node capability advertisement.  This
   enables node N1 and the controller N100 to know which segment nodes
   are capable of sending timestamped copy of packets.

5.  Probe Reply Message

5.1.  One-way Measurement Probe Reply

   For one-way performance measurement [RFC7679], the PM querier node
   can receive "out-of-bands" probe replies by properly setting the UDP
   Return Object (URO) TLV in the probe message.  The URO TLV (Type=131)
   is defined in [RFC7876] and includes the UDP-Destination-Port and IP
   Address.  In particular, if the querier sets its own IP address in
   the URO TLV the probe response is sent back by the responder node to
   the querier node.

   The PM process in the control plane on the responder node copies the
   content of the DM TLV into the payload of the PM reply message.

5.1.1.  Probe Reply Message to Controller

   As shown in Figure 1, if the querier node N1 requires the probe reply
   to be sent to the controller N100, it sets the IP address of N100 in
   the Address field of the URO TLV of the PM probe query message.

5.2.  Two-way Measurement Probe Reply

   To be added.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBA.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for the new SRH TLV Type for
   Delay Measurement.
