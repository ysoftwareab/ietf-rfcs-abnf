1.  Introduction

   Many Service Provider Service Level Agreements (SLAs) depend on the
   ability to measure performance loss metric experienced by the
   Customer data traffic flow.  Accurate Customer data packet loss can
   be measured by using a Direct Loss Measurement (DLM) procedure.
   Currently there is no efficient active measurement procedure
   available for accurate data packet loss detection in IP networks.
   Note that an approach for conducting packet loss measurement in IP
   networks is documented in [RFC7680].  This approach requires clock
   synchronization between the measurement points and lacks support for
   accurate data packet loss measurement.

Internet-Draft  Simple Direct Loss Measurement Procedure     August 2021


   [ITU-Y1731] defines procedures for performance loss monitoring for
   Ethernet-based networks.  Specifically, the Loss Measurement Message
   (LMM) defined in Section 9.12 of [ITU-Y1731] can be used for accurate
   frame loss measurement as described in Appendix II of that document.
   The procedure is specific to the Ethernet-based networks and does not
   apply to the IP networks.

   The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks [RFC8762] without the use of a control channel to pre-signal
   session parameters.  The STAMP can be used for (synthetic or
   inferred) packet loss measurement based on the Sequence Number in the
   test packets, however, this method can only provide approximate
   packet loss metrics.

   [RFC8972] defines optional extensions for STAMP.  The STAMP test
   packet with the "Direct Measurement" TLV (Type 5) [RFC8972] can be
   used for combined timestamps and data packet counters collection.
   This method, however, has the following limitations when used for
   detecting data packet loss:

   *  For only direct measurement, the STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV in
      the test packet requires the hardware to support timestamps, in
      addition to data packet counters.  One-way delay measurement also
      requires clock synchronization between the Session-Sender and
      Session-Reflector nodes.

   *  The location of the transmit counter is not at the fixed location
      in the STAMP test packet with the "Direct Measurement" TLV.  Also,
      the location of the transmit counter on the STAMP Session-
      Reflector reply test packet is not at the same location as the
      STAMP Session-Sender test packet using the "Direct Measurement"
      TLV.  This makes it difficult to implement in hardware, e.g., for
      point-to-point links and circuits.

   *  Furthermore, for hardware-based implementation, the optional
      "Direct Measurement" TLV adds unnecessary processing overhead on
      the Session-Reflector as not all STAMP Session-Sender test packets
      carry the "Direct Measurement" TLV and also there can be multiple
      TLV Types present.

   *  The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV does not support 64-bit
      counters.

   *  The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV does not support counters for
      bytes.

   *  The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV does not support counters per
      traffic class.

   *  The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV also does not identify the
      Block Number of the Direct Measurement, which is required for
      Alternate-Marking Method [RFC8321] for data packet loss
      measurement.  The AMM also handles the case of out-of-order data
      packets.

   This document defines Simple Two-Way Direct Loss Measurement (DLM)
   procedure that can be used for Alternate-Marking Method [RFC8321] for
   detecting accurate data packet loss in a network.  Specifically, DLM
   probe packets are defined for both unauthenticated and authenticated
   modes and they are efficient for hardware-based implementation.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   As shown in the reference topology, the Session-Sender S1 initiates a
   Direct Loss Measurement (DLM) probe packet over UDP transport.  The
   Session-Reflector R1 receives the Session-Sender's DLM probe packet
   and acts according to the local configuration.  The Session-Reflector
   R1 transmits a DLM reply probe packet to the Session-Sender S1.

3.  Overview

   For accurate data packet loss detection, the DLM probe packets are
   transmitted by the Session-Sender over UDP transport, and are used to
   collect the transmit and receive counters for the data traffic flow
   under measurement.  The DLM reply probe packets are transmitted by
   the Session-Reflector to collect the transmit and receive counters
   for the data traffic flow under measurement in the reverse direction.

   The DLM probe packets carry user-configured destination UDP port.
   The destination UDP port 862 is not used for the DLM probe packets.
   The user-configured destination UDP port follows the guidelines
   described in Section 4.1 of [RFC8762].  Different destination UDP
   port is used for DLM probe packets than the STAMP test packets
   defined in [RFC8762].  Hence, the Session-Sender and the Session-
   Reflector do not require backwards compatibility and support for
   STAMP.

Internet-Draft  Simple Direct Loss Measurement Procedure     August 2021


   A DLM session is identified by the 4-tuple (source and destination IP
   addresses, source and destination UDP port numbers).  A DLM Session-
   Sender MAY generate a locally unique Sender Session Identifier
   (SSID).  The SSID is a two-octet, non-zero unsigned integer.  The
   SSID generation policy is implementation specific.  An implementation
   MUST NOT assign the same identifier to different DLM sessions.  A
   Session-Sender MAY use the SSID to identify a DLM session.  If the
   SSID is used, it MUST be present in each probe packet of the given
   DLM session.

   The DLM Session-Reflector operates in the Stateless mode.  The DLM
   Session-Reflector does not maintain session state and will use the
   value in the Sequence Number field in the received probe packet as
   the value for the Sequence Number field in the reply probe packet.
   As a result, values in the Sequence Number and Session-Sender
   Sequence Number fields are the same in this mode.

   In this document, the examples of DLM probe packets are shown with
   UDP header, however, the packets can be encapsuated with a different
   header based on the the transport protocol used in the network.

4.  Session-Sender Direct Loss Measurement Probe Packet

   In this document, base Session-Sender DLM probe packet formats are
   defined as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for unauthenticated and
   authenticated modes, respectively.  They are stand-alone DLM probe
   packet formats to carry the counters for the data traffic flow under
   measurement.  The DLM probe packet formats are similar to the base
   STAMP test packet formats (for example the locations of the Counters
   and Timestamps).

   Fields are defined as the following:

   Sequence Number (32-bit): For each new DLM session, its value starts
   at zero and is incremented by one with each transmitted DLM probe
   packet.  The Sequence Number helps to check the DLM session state as
   active or not active, as well as detect probe packet drops.

   Transmit Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets
   transmitted by the Session-Sender in the DLM probe packet.  The
   counter is always written at the well-known fixed location in the DLM
   probe packet.  This is an important property for hardware-based
   implementation, e.g., for point-to-point links and circuits.  Counter
   is for the data traffic flow under measurement.

   XBT Flags (3-bit): The meanings of the Flag bits are:
      X: Extended counter format indicator.  Indicates the use of
      extended (64-bit) counter values.  Initialized to 1 upon creation
      (and prior to transmission) of a DLM probe packet.  Set to 0 when
      the DLM probe packet is transmitted or received over an interface
      that writes 32-bit counter values.

      B: Octet (byte) count.  When set to 1, indicates that the Counter
      fields represent octet counts.  The octet count applies to all
      packets within the DLM scope, and the octet count of a packet
      transmitted or received includes the total length of that packet
      (but excludes headers, labels, or framing of the channel itself).
      When set to 0, indicates that the Counter fields represent packet
      counts.

      T: Traffic-class-specific measurement indicator.  Set to 1 when
      the DLM session is scoped to data packets of a particular traffic
      class (DSCP value), and 0 otherwise.  When set to 1, the DSCP
      field of the DLM probe packet indicates the measured traffic
      class.

   DSCP (6-bit): DSCP of the data traffic flow being measured when T
   flag is set.

   Block Number (7-bit): The Direct Loss Measurement using Alternate-
   Marking Method [RFC8321] requires to collect Block Number of the
   counters for the data traffic flow under measurement.  To be able to
   correlate the transmit and receive counters of the matching Block
   Number, the Block Number of the counters carried in the DLM probe
   packets.

   SSID (16-bit): DLM Sender Session Identifier.

Internet-Draft  Simple Direct Loss Measurement Procedure     August 2021


   HMAC: The use of the HMAC field is described in Section 4.4 of
   [RFC8762].  HMAC uses its own key and the mechanism to distribute the
   HMAC key is outside the scope of this document.

   MBZ: Must be Zero.  It MUST be all zeroed on the transmission and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.

5.  Session-Reflector Direct Loss Measurement Probe Packet

   The Session-Reflector receives the DLM Session-Sender probe packet
   and verifies it.  If the DLM probe packet is validated, the Session-
   Reflector that supports this specification prepares and transmits the
   DLM reply probe packet.  In this document, Session-Reflector DLM
   reply probe packet formats are defined as shown in Figure 3 and

     Figure 4: Session-Reflector Direct Loss Measurement Probe Packet -
                             Authenticated Mode

   Fields are defined as the following:

   Sequence Number (32-bit): This is the exact copy of the Sequence
   Number from the received Session-Sender DLM probe packet that allows
   Stateless mode of Session-Reflector.

   Transmit Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets
   transmitted by the Session-Reflector in the DLM reply probe packet.
   Counter is for the reverse direction data traffic flow under
   measurement.  The Session-Reflector writes the Transmit Counter at
   the same location in the DLM reply probe packet as the Session-Sender
   DLM probe packet.  This is an important property for hardware-based
   implementation.

   XBT Flags (3-bit): The XBT Flags for the reverse direction data
   traffic flow under measurement set using the same procedure defined
   for the Session-Sender DLM probe packet.

   DSCP (6-bit): Set for the reverse direction data traffic flow under
   measurement using the same procedure defined for the Session-Sender
   DLM probe packet.

   Block Number (7-bit): Set for the reverse direction data traffic flow
   under measurement using the same procedure defined for the Session-
   Sender DLM probe packet.

   SSID: SSID is the exact copy of the SSID in the received Session-
   Sender DLM probe packet.

   Receive Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets received at
   the Session-Reflector.  It is written by the Session-Reflector in the
   DLM reply probe packet.  Counter is for the data traffic flow under
   measurement.

   Session-Sender Counter (64-bit): This is the exact copy of the
   Transmit Counter from the received Session-Sender DLM probe packet.

   Session-Sender Sequence Number (32-bit): This is the exact copy of
   the Sequence Number from the received Session-Sender DLM probe
   packet.

   Session-Sender Block Number: This is the exact copy of the Block
   Number from the received Session-Sender DLM probe packet.

   Session-Sender FLAGS: This is the exact copy of the XBT Flags from
   the received Session-Sender DLM probe packet.

   Session-Sender DSCP: This is the exact copy of the DSCP from the
   received Session-Sender DLM probe packet.

   Session-Sender TTL: The Session-Sender TTL field is one octet long,
   and its value is the copy of the TTL field in IPv4 (or Hop Limit in
   IPv6) from the received Session-Sender DLM probe packet.

6.  Data Loss Calculation

   Using the Counters C1, C2, C3 and C4 as per reference topology, from
   the nth and (n-1)th DLM probe packets, packet loss and byte loss for
   the data traffic flow can be calculated as follows:

   Transmit Loss TxL[ n-1, n] = (C1[ n] - C1[ n-1]) - (C2[ n] - C2[
   n-1])

   Receive Loss RxL[ n-1, n] = (C3[ n] - C3[ n-1]) - (C4[ n] - C4[ n-1])

   The Total Transmit and Receive Loss are calculated as follows:

   Total Transmit Loss = TxL[ 1, 2] + TxL[ 2, 3] + ...

   Total Receive Loss = RxL[ 1, 2] + RxL[ 2, 3] + ...

   These values are updated each time a DLM reply probe packet is
   received and processed at the Session-Sender, and they represent the
   Total Transmit and Total Receive Loss since the DLM session was
   initiated.  When computing the values TxL[n-1,n] and RxL[n-1,n], the
   possibility of counter wrap must be taken into account.

   When using Alternate-Marking Method, all Counters used for loss
   calculation belongs to the same Block Number, as described in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC8321].

7.  Optional Extensions

   There are currently no optional (TLV) extensions defined for the DLM
   probe packets.

8.  Integrity Protection and Confidentiality Protection

   The integrity protection and confidentiality protection specified in
   [RFC8762] also apply to the procedures defined in this document.

9.  Operational Considerations

   The operational considerations specified in [RFC8762] also apply to
   the procedures defined in this document.

10.  Security Considerations

   The DLM protocol is intended for deployment in limited domains
   [RFC8799].  As such, it assumes that a node involved in DLM protocol
   operation has previously verified the integrity of the path and the
   identity of the far-end Session-Reflector.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the Session-Sender, of the counter fields in
   received reply probe packets.  The minimal state associated with
   these protocols also limits the extent of measurement disruption that
   can be caused by a corrupt or invalid probe packet to a single probe
   cycle.

   The security considerations specified in [RFC8762] and [RFC8972] also
   apply to the protocol defined in this document.  Specifically, the
   message integrity protection using HMAC, as defined in [RFC8762]
   Section 4.4, also apply to the procedure described in this document.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
