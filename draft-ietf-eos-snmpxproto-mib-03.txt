1.  The SNMP Management Framework

  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
  components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
       1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
       in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
       STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
       the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
       track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
       [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
       message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
       [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
       [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
       in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
  can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
  MIB.

2. Introduction


   Traditionally, features have been added to SNMP by developing a new
   version of the protocol that supports these new features. Currently,
   SNMP entities that conform to [RFC 2571] are expected to implement
   all the protocol functionality defined by the standards.

   The idea, moving forward, is to add features to SNMP in a more
   modular fashion and without necessarily increasing the version
   number.  Since the protocol version number is no longer sufficient
   information to determine which protocol features an SNMP entity
   supports, another method is required.  This memo defines a MIB to be
   used to determine the SNMP capabilities of an SNMP entity,
   independent of its protocol version.


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3. Extended Protocol Management

3.1 SNMP Extensions

   SNMP extensions are those standard protocol extensions that are
   developed within the IETF and published in standards track RFCs.

3.2 Interoperability

   An SNMP entity that supports version 2 of the protocol operations
   [RFC1905] MUST be able to communicate with an SNMP entity supporting
   extended protocol operations. This communication MUST be in a manner
   consistent with communicating with an SNMP entity that supports
   version 2 of the protocol operations. Similarly, an SNMP entity that
   supports extended protocol operations MUST be able to communicate
   with SNMP entities which support version 2 of the protocol
   operations.

   An SNMP entity that supports the extended protocol operations SHOULD
   support protocol operations as defined in version 2 of the protocol
   operations [RFC1905]. The get-request operation MUST be supported.

   A command generator SHOULD query a command responder before issuing
   an extended protocol operation to determine if the command responder
   supports the operation.

   An SNMP entity MUST only issue a response using an extended protocol
   feature if it received the request using the extended protocol
   feature.

   If an SNMP entity receives an extended protocol feature it does not
   understand, it MUST follow the unknown PDU response mechanism as
   defined in [RFC2262] section 4.2.2.1

3.3 Relation to MAX-ACCESS Clause

   MAX-ACCESS, as defined in [RFC1902], indicates whether it makes
   "protocol sense" to read, write and/or create an instance of the
   object, or to include its value in a notification.  It is useful for
   this discussion to term read, write, create and accessible for
   notify as different classes of access to MIB objects. In the case of
   the protocol operations defined in [RFC1905], the get-request,
   get-next-request, get-bulk-request would all belong to the read
   class. The set-request would belong to the write class and the
   create class. The inform-request and the snmpV2-trap would both
   belong to the accessible for notify class. The protocol capabilities
   identified using this memo indicate which specific protocol
   operations are supported on the object if the appropriate class of
   access is allowed.

   If a protocol operation is not supported on a given object, it only
   affects the protocol capabilities statement, if its access class is
   supported for that object. For example, if an object is read-only
   and therefore does not support the write class, the system can still
   claim support of the set-request operation so long as all objects
   that do support the write class support the set-request. However, if
   the object does not support the get-bulk-request, the system cannot
   claim support of this protocol operation as this object supports the
   read class.

3.4 Relation to Agent Capabilities

   Agent capability statements are used when describing capabilities of
   agents with respect to object definitions.  The extended protocol
   MIB is used when describing the capabilities of agents with respect
   to protocol operations.

4. MIB Overview

   The snmpXProtoSystem object indicates which protocol operations are
   supported by the entire SNMP entity. snmpXProtoSubTreeTable
   indicates additional protocol operations supported on particular MIB
   sub trees.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANASnmpProtocol is a bitmap that indicates which standard SNMP
   operations an SNMP entity supports.  New values for this bitmap may
   be given out for SNMP protocol extensions published as standards
   track RFCs.

   The following shall be used as the initial values, but the latest
   values for these textual conventions should be obtained from IANA:

7. Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB
   is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.
