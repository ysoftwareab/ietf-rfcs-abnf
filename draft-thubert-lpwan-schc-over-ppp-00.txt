Abstract

   This document extends RFC 5172 to signal the use of SCHC as the
   compression method between a pair of nodes over PPP.  Combined with
   RFC 2516, this enables the use of SCHC over Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

1.  Introduction

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC5172] provides a standard
   method of encapsulating network-layer protocol information over
   point-to-point links.  "A Method for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet
   (PPPoE)" [RFC2516] transports PPP over Ethernet between a pair of
   nodes.  It is compatible with a translating bridge to Wi-Fi, and
   therefore enables PPP over Wi-Fi as well.

   PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a
   family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
   configuring different network-layer protocols.  "IP Version 6 over
   PPP" [RFC5072] defines the IPv6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP) , which is
   an NCP for a PPP link, and allows for the negotiation of desirable
   parameters for an IPv6 interface over PPP.

   "Negotiation for IPv6 Datagram Compression Using IPv6 Control
   Protocol" [RFC5172] defines the IPv6 datagram compression option that
   can be negotiated by a node on the link through the IPV6CP.  The
   "Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and fragmentation for
   LPWAN, application to UDP/IPv6" [SCHC] is a compression and
   fragmentation technique that was defined after the publication of
   [RFC5172].  In order to enable SCHC over PPP and therefore Ethernet
   and Wi-Fi, [RFC5172] must be extended to signal SCHC as an additional
   compression method for use over PPP.

2.  BCP 14

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extending RFC 5172

   [RFC5172] defines an IPV6CP option called the IPv6-Compression-
   Protocol Configuration option with a type of 2.  The option contains
   an IPv6-Compression-Protocol field value that indicates a compression
   protocol and an optional data field as shown in Figure 1:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |   IPv6-Compression-Protocol   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Data ...
      +-+-+-+-+

        Figure 1: The IPv6-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option

   This specification indicates a new IPv6-Compression-Protocol field
   value for [SCHC] (see Section 5, and enables to transport a Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] of the set of rules in the
   optional data.  The default format for the set of rules is YANG using
   the "Data Model for SCHC" [SCHC_DATA_MODEL] encoded in JSON as
   specified in [RFC7951].  If the encoding is asymetrical, the
   initiator of the session is considered downstream, playing the role
   of the device in an LPWAN network.

4.  Security Considerations

   This draft enables to use the SCHC compression and fragmentation over
   PPP and therefore Ethernet and Wi-Fi with PPPoE.  It inherits the
   possible threats against SCHC listed in the "Security considerations"
   section of [SCHC].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the allocation of a new value in the registry
   "IPv6-Compression-Protocol Types" for "SCHC".  A suggested value is
   proposed in Table 1:

   +-------+------------------------------------------+---------------+
   | Value | Description                              | Reference     |
   +=======+==========================================+===============+
   |   4   | Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) | This document |
   +-------+------------------------------------------+---------------+
