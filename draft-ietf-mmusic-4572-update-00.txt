Abstract

   This document updates RFC 4572 by clarifying the usage of multiple
   SDP 'fingerprint' attributes with a single TLS connection.  The
   document also updates the preferred cipher suite to be used, and
   removes the requirement to use the same hash function for calculating
   the certificate fingerprint that is used to calculate the certificate
   signature.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 4572 [RFC4572] specifies how to establish Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) connections using the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566].

   RFC 4572 defines the SDP 'fingerprint' attribute, which is used to
   carry a secure hash value associated with a certificate.  However,
   RFC 4572 is currently unclear on whether multiple 'fingerprint' can
   be associated with a single SDP media description ("m= line")
   [RFC4566], and the associated semantics.  Multiple 'fingerprint'
   attributes are needed when an endpoint wants to provide multiple
   fingerprint, using different hash functions, for a certificate.
   Multiple 'fingerprint' attributes are also needed if an endpoint
   wants to provide fingerprints associated with multiple certificates.
   For example, with RTP-based media, an endpoint might use different
   certificates for RTP and RTCP.

   RFC 4572 also specifies a preferred cipher suite.  However, the
   currently preferred cipher suite is considered outdated, and the
   preference needs to be updated.

   RFC 4572 mandates that the hash function used to calculate the
   fingerprint is the same hash function used to calculate the
   certificate signature.  That requirement might prevent usage of
   newer, stronger and more collision-safe hash functions for
   calculating certificate fingerprints.

   This document updates RFC 4572 [RFC4572] by clarifying the usage of
   multiple SDP 'fingerprint' attributes with a single TLS connection.
   The document also updates the preferred cipher suite to be used, and

   removes the requirement to use the same hash function for calculating
   the certificate fingerprint and certificate signature.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC 4572

   This section updates section 5 of RFC 4572.

3.1.  Update to the sixth paragraph of section 5


OLD TEXT:

   A certificate fingerprint MUST be computed using the same one-way
   hash function as is used in the certificate's signature algorithm.
   (This ensures that the security properties required for the
   certificate also apply for the fingerprint.  It also guarantees that
   the fingerprint will be usable by the other endpoint, so long as the
   certificate itself is.)  Following RFC 3279 [7] as updated by RFC
   4055 [9], therefore, the defined hash functions are 'SHA-1' [11]
   [19], 'SHA-224' [11], 'SHA-256' [11], 'SHA-384' [11], 'SHA-512' [11],
   'MD5' [12], and 'MD2' [13], with 'SHA-1' preferred.  A new IANA
   registry of Hash Function Textual Names, specified in Section 8,
   allows for addition of future tokens, but they may only be added if
   they are included in RFCs that update or obsolete RFC 3279 [7].
   Self-signed certificates (for which legacy certificates are not a
   consideration) MUST use one of the FIPS 180 algorithms (SHA-1,
   SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512) as their signature algorithm,
   and thus also MUST use it to calculate certificate fingerprints.

   Function Textual Names, specified in Section 8, allows for addition

3.2.  New paragraphs to the end of section 5



 NEW TEXT:

     Multiple SDP fingerprint attributes can be associated with an m-
     line. This can occur if multiple fingerprints have been calculated
     for a certificate, using different hash algorithms. It can also
     occur if multiple certificates might be used (e.g. separate
     certificates for RTP and RTCP). In such cases, the same number of
     fingerprints MUST be calculated for each certificate, and for each
     certificate the same set of hash algorithms MUST be used.

     An endpoint MUST be able to match at least one of the received
     fingerprints with the cerficiate(s) to be used. If there is no
     match, the endpoint MUST NOT establish the TLS connection.

     NOTE: The SDP fingerprint attribute does not contain a reference to
     a specific certificate. Endpoints need to compare all fingerprints
     with the cerficiate hash when looking for a match.
