Abstract

This Internet Draft defines a protocol for backhauling of SS7 MTP2 
User signaling messages over IP using the Sigtran Common Transport 
Protocol (SCTP).  This protocol would be used between a Signaling 
Gateway (SG) and Media Gateway Controller (MGC).  It is assumed that 
the SG receives SS7 signaling over a standard SS7 interface using the 
SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.

1.  Introduction

1.1 Scope

There is a need for SCN signaling protocol delivery from an Signaling 
Gateway (SG) to a Media Gateway Controller (MGC).  The delivery 
mechanism should meet the following criteria: 

*  Support for MTP Level 2 / MTP Level 3 interface boundary
*  Support for communication between Layer Management modules on SG and 
   MGC
*  Support for management of active associations between the SG and MGC

In other words, the Signaling Gateway will terminate MTP Level 1 and MTP
Leve 2 and will transport MTP Level 3 messages to a Media Gateway 
Controller (MGC).

1.2 Terminology

MTP2-User - A protocol that normally uses the services of MTP Level 2 
(i.e. MTP3).

Interface - For the purposes of this document, an interface is a SS7
signaling link.

Association - An association refers to a SCTP association.  The 
association will provide the transport for the delivery of protocol 
data units for one or more interfaces.

Stream - A stream refers to a SCTP stream.  For the purposes of this
document, a stream will be mapped to a SS7 signaling link, or interface.

Backhaul - Refers to the transport of signaling from the point of 
interface for the associated data stream (i.e., SG function in the MGU) 
back to the point of call processing (i.e., the MGCU), if this is not 
local [4].

Application Server Process - A process instance of an Application Server. 
Up to 3 processes can be defined (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary).  
Examples of Application Server Processes are primary or backup MGC 
instances.

Application Server Process Path (or just Path) - A Path to a remote 
Application Server Process instance.  A Path maps 1:1 to an SCTP 
association).

Application Server - Groups all the Application Server Processes 
associated with an application (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary). 
Examples of Application Servers are virtual MGCs or IP Databases.

Fail-over - The capability to re-route signaling traffic as required 
between related Application Server Processes in the event of failure or 
unavailability of the currently used Application Server Process (e.g., 
from primary MGC to back-up MGC).  Fail-over also applies upon the 
return to service of a previously unavailable Process. 

Signaling Link Terminal (SLT) - Refers to the means of performing all
of the functions defined at MTP level 2 regardless of their 
implementation [2].

1.3 Signaling Transport Architecture

The architecture that has been defined for SCN signaling transport
over IP uses multiple components, including an IP transport
protocol, a signaling common transport protocol (SCTP) and an adaptation
module to support the functions expected by a particular SCN signaling 
protocol from its underlying protocol layer.  


Morneault, Kalla & Sidebottom                                   [Page 3]

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999


In reference to the SIGTRAN framework architecture [4], this document 
defines a SCN adaptation module that is suitable for the transport of 
SS7 MTP2 User.  The only SS7 MTP2 User is MTP3.

In a Signaling Gateway, it is expected that the SS7 signaling is 
received over a standard SS7 network termination, using the SS7 Message 
Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport of SS7 signaling messages to 
and from an SS7 Signaling End Point (SEP) or SS7 Signaling Transfer 
Point (STP).  In other words, the SG acts as a Signaling Link Terminal 
(SLT) [2].  The SG then provides interworking of transport functions 
with IP Signaling Transport, in order to transport the MTP3 signaling 
messages to the MGC where the peer MTP3 protocol layer exists, as shown 
below:

    ******    SS7    ******      IP     *******
    *SEP *-----------* SG *-------------* MGC *
    ******           ******             *******

Note: STPs may be present in the SS7 path between the SEP and the SG.

1.3.1  UDP port

A request will be made to IANA to assign a UDP port for M2UA.

1.4  Services Provided by the M2UA Adaptation Layer

The SS7 MTP3/MTP2(MTP2-User) interface is retained at the termination 
point in the IP network, so that the M2UA protocol layer is required to 
provide the equivalent set of services to its users as provided by the 
MTP Level 2 to MTP Level 3.

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999

This includes the following services:
 
1.4.1  Support for MTP Level 2 / MTP Level 3 interface boundary

Also provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless, or 
as seamless as possible, operation of the MTP2-User peers in the SS7 and 
IP domains.  This includes   

Data

Provides the ability to transport MTP2 User information (in this case, 
MTP Level 3 PDUs).

Link Establish

Provides the ability to request MTP Level 2 to bring SS7 links 
in-service.

Link Release

Provides the ability to request MTP Level 2 to take SS7 links out-of-
service.  Also, provides mechanism for MTP2 to autonomously indicate 
that SS7 link(s) have gone out-of-service.

Link State

Provides the ability to request state change or information on a
per link basis.  Some examples would be the forcing of Local Processor
Outage or flushing buffers.

Link Status

Provides a means for asychronous notification of link state changes to 
be reported to the upper layer (MTP Level 3).  An examples would be the 
reporting of remote processor
outage event.

Data Retrieval

Provides a mechanism to perform SS7 link changeover procedure in
the case of a SS7 link failure.

1.4.2  Support for communication between Layer Management modules
       on SG and MGC

It is envisioned that the M2UA layer needs to provide some messages that
will facilitate communication between Layer Management modules on the SG
and MGC. 

To facilitate reporting of errors that arise because of backhauling MTP
Level 3 scenario, the following primitive is defined:


Morneault, Kalla & Sidebottom                                   [Page 5]

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999

M-ERROR

The M-ERROR message is used to indicate an error with a received
M2UA message (e.g., interface identifier value is not known to the SG).

1.4.3  Support for management of active associations between SG and MGC

The M2UA layer on the SG keeps the state of various ASPs it is associated
with.  A set of primitives between M2UA layer and the Layer Management 
are defined below to help the Layer Management manage the association(s) 
between the SG and the MGC.

M-SCTP ESTABLISH

The M-SCTP ESTABLISH primitive is used to request, indicate and confirm 
the establishment of SCTP association to a peer M2UA node.  

The M2UA layer may also need to inform the status of the SCTP 
association(s) to the Layer Management.  This can be achieved using
the following primitive.

M-SCTP STATUS

The M-SCTP STATUS primitive is used to request and indicate the status
of underlying SCTP association(s).

The Layer Management may need to inform the M2UA layer of a user status
(i.e., failure, active, etc.), so that messages can be exchanged between 
M2UA layer peers to stop traffic to the local M2UA user.  This can be
achieved using the following primitive.

M-ASP STATUS

The M-ASP STATUS primitive is used by the Layer Management to indicate
the status of the local M2UA user to the M2UA layer.

1.5  Functions Provided by the M2UA Layer 

1.5.1  Mapping

The M2UA layer must maintain a map of a Interface ID to a physical
interface on the Signaling Gateway.  A physical interface would be a 
V.35 line, T1 line/timeslot, E1 line/timeslot, etc.   The M2UA layer 
must also maintain a map of Interface ID to SCTP association and to a 
stream within the association.








Morneault, Kalla & Sidebottom                                   [Page 6]

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999

1.5.2  Status of ASPs

The M2UA layer on the Signaling Gateway must maintain the state of one or 
more Application Server Process(es) it is associated with.  The state of
an ASP changes because of reception of peer-to-peer messages or reception
of indications from the local SCTP association.  ASP state transition
procedures are described in Section Section 3.3.

1.5.3  Flow Control / Congestion

It is possible for the M2UA layer to be informed of IP network congestion 
by means of an implementation-dependent function  (i.e. an indication 
from the SCTP).  If the M2UA layer receives this indication, the action(s)
taken are implementation dependent.

1.5.4  SCTP Stream Management

SCTP allows user specified number of streams to be opened during the
initialization.  It is the responsibility of the M2UA layer to ensure 
proper management of these streams.  SCTP streams provide a means for
avoiding head of line blocking.  For that reason, a stream will be used 
per SS7 signaling link terminated by the Signaling Gateway.  The SS7 
signaling link is identified by the Interface Identifier in the message 
header (refer to Section 2.3).

1.5.5  Seamless SS7 Network Management Interworking

If the SG loses the SCTP association to the MGC, it should follow
MTP 2 processor outage procedures [2].

1.5.6  Management Inhibit/Uninhibit

Local Management may wish to stop traffic across an SCTP association in
order to temporarily remove the association from service or to perform
testing and maintenance activity.  The function could optionally be used
to manage the start of traffic on to a newly-available SCTP association.

2.1.3  Message Length

The Message length defines the length of the message in octets, not 
including the header.

2.2  M2UA Message Header

In addition to the common message header, there will be a M2UA specific
message header.  The M2UA specific message header will immediately
follow the common message header, but will only be used with MAUP and 
MGMT messages.

This message header will contain the Interface Identifier.  The Interface 
Identifier identifies the physical interface at the SG for which the 
signaling messages are sent/received.  The interface identifier follows 

Morneault, Kalla & Sidebottom                                   [Page 9]

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999


the same endpoint naming scheme provided in MGCP [7].  For example, if 
a Signaling Gateway terminates a E1 and the SS7 signaling link is one 
timeslot 16, the interface identifier could be the following:

       e1/16@sgw1.example.net

The use of wildcards is not acceptable.

Note:  The Interface Identifier string should be padded to 32-bit 
boundaries.  The length field indicates the end of the string.

2.3.1.2  Establish (Request, Confirmation)

The Establish Request message is used to establish the channel or to 
indicate that the channel has been established.  Note that the gateway 
may already have the channel established at its layer.  If so, upon 
receipt of an Establish Request, the gateway takes no action except to 
send an Establish Confirm.

   RELEASE_OTHER  0x3     Other reason SS7 link out-of-service

(should we keep it simple, or provide list of reasons that would
enable debugging)

2.3.1.4  State (Request, Confirm)

The State Request message can be sent from a MGC to cause an action 
on a particular SS7 link supported by the Signaling Gateway.  The gateway 
sends a State Confirm to the MGC if the action has been successfully 
completed.  The State Confirm reflects that state value received in
the State Request message.

2.3.1.6  Retrieval (Request, Confirm)

The MTP2 Retrieval Request message is used during the MTP Level 3 
changeover procedure to request the BSN, to retrieve PDUs from the 
retransmit queue or to flush PDUs from the retransmit queue.

   ACTION_DROP_MSGS     0x3     Drop the PDUs in the retransmit queue.

In the Retrieval Request message, the fsn_bsn field contains the FSN of 
the far end if the action is ACTION_RTRV_MSGS. 

When the Signaling Gateway sends a Retrieval Confirm to this request, 
it echos the action and puts the BSN in the fsn_bsn field if the action 
was ACTION_RTRV_BSN.

2.3.1.7  Retrieval Indication

The Retrieval Indication message is sent by the Signaling Gateway 
with a PDU from the retransmit queue.  The Retrieval Indication
message does not contain the Action or fsn_bsn fields, just a PDU from
the retransmit queue.

2.3.1.8  Retrieval Complete Indication

The MTP2 Retrieval Complete Indication message is exactly the same as 
the MTP2 Retrieval Indication message except that it also indicates that 
it contains the last PDU from the retransmit queue.

2.3.2  Application Server Process Maintenance (ASPM) Messages

The ASPM messages will only use the common header.

2.3.2.1  ASP UP (ASPUP)

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999


The ASPUP message is used to indicate to a remote M2UA peer that the 
layer is ready to receive traffic or maintenance messages.

The ASPUP message contains the following parameters:

     Adaptation Layer Identifer (optional)
     SCN Protocol Identifier (optional)
     
The Adaptation Layer Identifier is a string that identifies the 
adaptation layer.  This string must be set to "M2UA" which means
the length will be 4.

The Protocol Identifier field contains the identity of the specific SCN 
signaling protocol being transported.  The Protocol ID defines the 
protocol type, variant, and version, and thereby specifies the components 
and encoding of the PROTOCOL DATA field.  The Protocol Identifier also 
defines what SCN protocol message components are included in the PROTOCOL 
DATA.

(Ed. Note: Need encoding of mime-type value or OID or fixed 
string/integer that will be administered outside of this document 
(IANA). Also, perhaps bring in text from Christian's mime document - See 
"draft-ietf-sigtran-mime-isup.txt" for an example of an application/ISUP 
media type defined according to the rules defined in RFC 2048.?)

The format for the ASPUP message is as follows:


    0            15 16           31
   +---------------+---------------+
   |   Tag (0x2)   |    Length     |

2.3.2.3  ASP Active (ASPAC)

The ASPAC message is sent by an ASP to indicate to an SG that it is 
the active ASP to be used from within a list of primary and back-up ASPs
for a particular signaling mapping relationship.

The ASPAC message contains the following parameters:

2.3.2.4  ASP Inactive (ASPIA)

The ASPIA message is sent by an ASP to indicate to an SG that it is 
no longer the the active ASP to be used from within a list of primary 
and back-up ASP for a particular signaling mapping relationship.  The 
SG will respond with an ASPIA message and either buffer or discard 
incoming messages for a timed period and then discard.

The ASPIA message contains the following parameters:

     INFO String

The format for the ASPIA message is as follows:

2.3.3  Layer Management (MGMT) Messages

2.3.3.1  Error (ERR)

The ERR message is sent when an invalid value is found in an incoming 
messages.  

The ERR message contains the following parameters:

     Error Code

The format for the ERR message is as follows:

3.0  Procedures

The M2UA layers needs to respond to various primitives it receives from 
other layers as well as messages it receives from the peer-to-peer 
messages.  This section describes various procedures involved in 
response to these events.

3.1  Procedures to Support Service in Section 1.4.1

These procedures achieve the M2UA layer's "Transport of MTP Level 2 / 
MTP Level 3 boundary" service.

3.1.1  MTP Level 2 / MTP Level 3 Boundary Procedures

On receiving a primitives from the local layer, the M2UA layer will 
send the corresponding MAUP message (see Section 2) to its peer.  The 
M2UA layer must fill in various fields of the common and specific headers
correctly.  In addition the message needs to be sent on the SCTP stream 
that corresponds to the SS7 link.

3.1.2  MAUP Message Procedures

On receiving MAUP messages from a peer M2UA layer, the M2UA layer on an 
SG or MGC needs to invoke the corresponding layer primitives to the 
local MTP Level 2 or MTP Level 3 layer.

3.2  Procedures to Support Service in Section 1.4.2

3.2.1  LM primitives procedures

On receiving these primitives from the local layer, the M2UA layer will 
send the corresponding LM message (Error) to its peer.  The M2UA layer 
must fill in the various fields of the common and specific headers 
correctly.

3.2.2 LM message procedures

Upon receipt of LM messages the M2UA layer must invoke the corresponding
Layer Management primitives (M-ERROR) to the local layer management.

3.3 Procedures to Support Service in Section 1.4.3

These procedures achieve the M2UA layer's "Support for management of 
active associations between SG and MGC" service.

3.3.1 AS and ASP State

The state of the each ASP is maintained in the M2UA layer on the SG. The 
state of an ASP changes due to events. The events include:

   * Reception messages from peer M2UA layer
   * Reception of indications from layers below

The ASP state transition diagram is shown in Figure 4.

The possible states of an ASP are:

ASP-DOWN: Application Server Process is unavailable.  Initially all ASPs 
  are in this state.

ASP-UP: Application Server Process is available but application traffic is
  stopped.

ASP-ACTIVE: Application Server Process is available and application traffic
  is active.  At most one ASP per AS can be in the active state.

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999

AS-DOWN: Application Server is unavailable.  This state implies that all
  ASPs are in the ASP-DOWN state for this AS.

AS-UP: One or more ASPs are in the ASP-UP state.

AS-ACTIVE: Application Server is available and application traffic is
  active.  This state implies that one ASP is in the ASP-ACTIVE state.

AS-PENDING: Currently Active ASP became inactive or SCTP association with it
  is lost. A Recovery timer will be started and in coming SCN messages will
  be queuedby the SG. If an ASP becomes Active before the recovery timer
  expires, AS will move to AS-ACTIVE state and all the queued messages will
  be sent to the active ASP. If the recovery timer expires before an ASP
  becomes active, SG stops queuing messages and discards all queued messages.
  AS will move to AS-UP if at least one ASP is in ASP-UP state, otherwise it
  will move to AS-DOWN state.

Note: If AS moves from AS-PENDING state to AS-UP or AS-DOWN states, the Layer
Management on MG may take appropriate SCN notification actions.

3.3.2 ASP UP

3.3.2.1 SG Operation

The SG will mark the path as up if an explicit ASP UP (ASPUP) message is 
received and internally the path is allowed to come up (i.e., not in a 
locked local maintenance state). An ASP UP (ASPUP) message will be sent 
to acknowledge the received ASPUP. The SG will respond to a ASPUP with a 
ASPDN message if the path is in a locked maintenance state.

The SG will send a ASPUP message in response to a received ASPUP message 
from the MGC even if that path was already marked as UP at the SG. 

The paths are controlled by the MGC. The SG will only send ASPUP in 
response to the reception of a ASPUP message. 

3.3.2.2 MGC Operation

The MGC will send ASPUP messages every 2 (add text regarding this being
a configurable timer) seconds until the path comes up (i.e. until it 
receives a ASPUP message from the SG for that path).  The MGC may decide 
to reduce the frequency (say to every 5 seconds) if the an acknowledge-
ment is not received after a few tries. 

The MGC should wait for the ASPUP message from the SG before transmitting 
ASP maintenance messages (ASPIA or ASPAC) or M2UA messages or it will 
risk message loss.  The ASPUP message received from the SG is not 
acknowledged by the MGC. 

3.3.3 ASP Down

3.3.3.1 SG Operation

The SG will mark the ASP as down and send a ASPDN message to the MGC if 
one of the following events occur:

     - a ASP Down(ASPDN) message is received from the MGC,
     - the ASP is locked by local maintenance. 

The SG will also send a ASPDN message when the ASP is already down and 
a ASPDN) message is received from the MGC.

3.3.3.2  MGC Operation

The MGC will send ASPDN whenever it wants to take down a ASP.  Since the 
ASPDN messages to the SG or the ASPDN responses from the SG can be lost
(for example, during a MGC node failover), the MGC can send ASPDN messages 
every 2 seconds until the path comes down (i.e. until it receives a ASPDN 
message from the SG for that path).

Internet Draft         SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer           Sep 1999

3.3.4  ASP Version Control

If a ASP Up message with an unknown version is received, the receiving 
end will respond with an Error message.  This will indicate to the 
sender which version the receiving node supports.

This is useful when protocol version upgrades are being performed.  A 
node with the newer version should support the older versions used on 
other nodes it is communicating with.

The version field in the Error message header associated with the will 
indicate the version supported by the node. 

3.3.5  ASP Inactive

When a ASPIA message is received, message transmission to that ASP ceases.
The SG will either discard all incoming messages or start buffering the 
incoming messages for N seconds after which messages will be discarded.

If the ASP is down, all of the Paths that were supported by that ASP
are, by default, down.
 
3.3.6  ASP Active

When a ASP Active (ASPAC) message is received, the SG will start routing 
to that ASP.  Reception of a ASPAC message overrides any previous ASPAC 
messages and results in the ASP associated with the ASPAC message to 
become the newly active ASP.

4.1  Establishment of associations between SG and MGC examples

An example of the message flows for establishing active associations between
SG and MGC is shown below.

                  SG                  ASP1
        
                        <----------- ASP Up
                  ASP Up ---------->
                  (ACK)
                        <----------- ASP Active
              ASP Active ---------->
              (ACK)

An example of message flows for establishment of associations with two 
ASPs and the message flows for take-over of the primary (ASP1) by the 
secondary (ASP2).

                 SG                    ASP1               ASP2

                        <----------- ASP Up
                  ASP Up ---------->
                  (ACK)
                        <------------------------------ ASP Up
                  ASP Up ------------------------------>
                  (ACK)
                        <----------- ASP Active
              ASP Active ---------->
              (ACK)
                              ...
        
                        <----------- ASP Inactive
            ASP Inactive ---------->
            (ACK)

                         (this message is optional)
            ASP Inactive ------------------------------>
                        <------------------------------ ASP Active
              ASP Active ------------------------------>
              (ACK)


4.2  MTP Level 2 / MTP Level 3 Boundary Examples

4.2.1  SS7 Link Alignment

The MGC can request that a SS7 link be brought into alignment using the 
normal or emergency procedure.  An example of the message flow to bring 
a SS7 link in-service using the normal alignment procedure is shown 
below. 

            SG                             MGC

                        <----------- Establish Request (ESTABLISH_START)
	Establish Response ---------->

4.2.2  SS7 Link Release

The MGC can request that a SS7 link be taken out-of-service.  It uses
the Release Request message as shown below.

            SG                             MGC
	
                        <------------ Release Request (RELEASE_MGMT)
	Release Response  ------------>

The SG can autonomously indicate that a SS7 link has gone out-of-service
as shown below.

            SG                             MGC
	
	Release Indication ------------>
      (RELEASE_PHYS)


4.2.3  Set and Clear Local Processor Outage

to be added

4.2.4  Notification of Processor Outage (local or remote)

to be added

4.2.5  Flush Buffers or Continue

to be added

4.2.6  SS7 Link Changeover

An example of the message flow for a changeover is shown below.

            SG                             MGC

                         <---------- Retrieval Request (MTP2_RTRV_BSN)
	Retrieval Confirm  ---------->
	(with BSN)
                         <---------- Retrieval Request (MTP2_RTRV_MSGS 
                                                         with FSN)
	Retrieval Confirm  ---------->

	Retrieval Ind 	 -----------> 
	Retrieval Ind 	 -----------> 
	Rtrvl Complete Ind ---------->

Note:  The number of Retrieval Indication is dependent on the number of
messages in the retransmit queue that have been requested.  Only one
Retrieval Complete Indication should be sent.
