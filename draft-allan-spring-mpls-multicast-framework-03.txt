Abstract 


   This document describes a multicast solution for Segment Routing with 
   MPLS data plane. It is consistent with the Segment Routing 
   architecture in that an IGP is augmented to distribute information in 
   addition to the link state. In this solution it is multicast group 
   membership information sufficient to synchronize state in a given 
   network domain. Computation is employed to determine the topology of 
   any loosely specified multicast distribution tree.

1. Introduction 

   This memo describes a solution for multicast for Segment Routing with 
   MPLS data plane in which source specific multicast distribution trees 
   (MDTs) are computed from information distributed via an IGP. 
   Computation can use information in the IGP to determine if a given 
   node in the network has a role as a root, leaf or replication point 
   in a given MDT. Unicast tunnels are employed to interconnect the 
   nodes determined to have a role. Therefore state only need be 
   installed in nodes that have one of these three roles to fully 
   instantiate an MDT.  
   Although this approach is computationally intensive, a significant 
   amount of computation can be avoided when the computing agent 
   determines that the node it is computing for has no role in a given 
   MDT. This permits a computed approach to multicast convergence to be 
   computationally tractable.

3.1. Terminology 

   Candidate replication point (CRP) - is a node that potentially needs 
   to install state to replicate multicast traffic as determined at an 
   intermediate step in multicast segment computation. It will either 
   resolve to having no role or a role as a replication point once 
   multicast has converged. 

   Candidate role - refers to any potential combination of roles on a 
   given multicast segment as determined at some intermediate step in 
   MDT computation. For example, a node with a candidate role may be a 
   leaf and may be a candidate replication point.

   Downstream - refers to the direction along the shortest path to one 
   or more leaves for a given multicast distribution tree 

   Multicast convergence - is when all computation and state 
   installation to ensure the FIB reflects the multicast information in 
   the IGP is complete. 

   MDT - multicast distribution tree. Is a tree composed of one or more 
   multicast segments.  

   Multicast segment - is a portion of the multicast tree where only the 
   root and the leaves have been specified, and computation based upon 
   the current state of the IGP database is employed to determine and 
   install the required state to implement the segment. For MPLS a 
   multicast segment is implemented as a p2mp LSP. A multicast segment 
   is identified by a multicast SID.  

   Multicast SID - Is the data plane identifier that is used to 
   implement a multicast segment. As per a unicast MPLS segment, the 
   rightmost 20 bits of a multicast SID is encoded as a label. It is 
   drawn from an SRGB that is global to the SR domain.  

   Pinned path - Is a unique shortest path extending from a leaf 
   upstream towards the root for a given multicast segment. Therefore is 
   a component of the multicast segment that it has been determined must 
   be there. It will not necessarily extend from the leaf all the way to 
   the root during intermediate computation steps. A pinned path can 
   result from pruning operations. 

   Role - refers specifically to a node that is either a root, a leaf, a 
   replication node, or a pinned waypoint for a given MDT. 

   Unicast convergence - is when all computation and state installation 
   to ensure the FIB reflects the unicast information in the IGP is 
   complete. 

   Upstream - refers to the direction along the shortest path to the 
   root of a given MDT. 

4. Solution Overview 

   This memo describes a multicast architecture in which multicast state 
   is only installed in those nodes that have roles as a root, leaves, 
   and replication points for a given multicast segment. The a-priori 
   established segment routing unicast tunnels are used as interconnect 
   between the nodes that have a role in a given multicast SID.

   A loosely specified MDT is composed of a single multicast segment and 
   the routing of the MDT is delegated entirely to computation driven by 
   information in the IGP database. 

   Explicitly routed MDTs are expressed as a tree of concatenated 
   multicast segments where both the leaves of each segment and the 
   waypoints coupling a given segment to the upstream and/or downstream 
   segment(s) is specified in information flooded in the IGP by the 
   overall root of the MDT. The segments themselves will be computed as 
   per a loosely specified MDT. 

   A PE acting as an overall root for a given tree is expected to be 
   configured by the operator as to where to source multicast traffic 
   from, be it an attachment circuit, interworking function for client 
   technology or other. Similarly a leaf for a given tree is expected to 
   be configured by the operator as to the disposition of received 
   multicast traffic.  

   A computed segment is guaranteed to be loop free in a stable system. 
   A concatenation of segments to construct an MDT will similarly be 
   loop free as any collision of segments can be disambiguated in the 
   data plane via the SIDs.  

   This architecture significantly reduces the amount of state that 
   needs to be installed in the data plane to support multicast. This 
   also means that the impact of many failures in the network on 
   multicast traffic distribution will be recovered by unicast local 
   repair or unicast convergence with subsequent multicast convergence 
   acting in the role of network re-optimization (as opposed to 
   restoration). 

4.1. Mapping source specific trees onto the segment routing architecture 

   A computed source specific tree for a given multicast group 
   corresponds to one or more multicast segments in the SR architecture. 
   Each multicast segment is assigned a SID, typically by management 
   configuration of the node that will be the overall root for the 
   source specific tree. The root node then uses the IGP to advertise 
   this information to all nodes in the IGP area/domain.  

   A multicast group is implemented as the set of source specific trees 
   from all nodes that have registered transmit interest to all nodes 
   that have registered receive interest in a multicast group.

4.2. Role of the Routing System 

   The role of the IGP is to communicate topology information, multicast 
   capability and associated algorithm, multicast registrations, unicast 
   to SID bindings, multicast to SID bindings and waypoints in multi-
   segment MDTs. No changes to topology or unicast to SID binding 
   advertisements are proposed by this memo.  

   The multicast registrations/bindings will be in the form of source, 
   group, transmit/receive interest and the SID to use for the source 
   specific multicast tree. Registrations are originated by any node 
   that has send or receive interest in a given multicast group. Nodes 
   will use the combination of topology and multicast registrations to 
   determine the nodes that have a role in each source specific tree and 
   the SID information to then derive the required FIB state.  

4.3. MDT Construction Requirements 

   A multicast segment in an MDT is constructed such that between any 
   pair of nodes that have a role in the segment and are connected by a 
   unicast tunnel, there is not another node on the shortest path 
   between the two with a role in that segment. This ensures that copies 
   of a packet forwarded by an multicast segment will traverse a link 
   only once in a stable system. 

   Note that this can be satisfied by a minimum cost shortest path tree, 
   but is not an absolute requirement. The pruning rules specified in 
   this memo will meet this requirement without necessarily producing 
   absolutely minimum cost multicast segment (or incurring the 
   associated computational cost). 

4.4. Pruning - theory of operation 

   The role of nodes in a given multicast segment is determined by first 
   producing an inclusive shortest path tree with all possible paths 
   between the root and leaves, and then applying a set of pruning rules 
   repeatedly until an acyclic tree is produced or no further prunes are 
   possible.  

   For the majority of multicast segments these rules will 
   authoritatively produce a minimum cost tree. For those segments that 
   have not yet been authoritatively resolved, there is a set of pruning 
   operations applied that are not guaranteed to produce a tree that 
   meets the requirements of 3.3, therefore these trees require auditing 
   and potential correction according to a further set of agreed rules. 
   This avoids the necessity of an exhaustive search of the solution 
   space.

   A node during computation of a segment may conclude that it will 
   absolutely not have a role at any of numerous points in the 
   computation process and abandon computation of that segment. 

5. Elements of Procedure 

5.1. Triggers for Computation 

   MDT computation is triggered by changes to the IGP database. These 
   are in the form of either changes in registered multicast group 
   interest, addition or removal of a multi-segment MDT descriptor, or 
   topology changes. 

   A change in registered interest for a group will require re-
   computation of all MDTs that implement the multicast group. 

   A topology change will require the computation of some number of 
   multicast segments, the actual number will depend on the 
   implementation of tree computation but at a minimum will be all trees 
   for which there is not an optimal shortest path solution as a result 
   of the topology change. 

5.2. FIB Determination 

5.2.1. Information in the IGP 

   Group membership information for a multicast segment is obtained from 
   the IGP. This is true for single segment MDTs as well as multi-
   segment MDTs. Included in the multi-segment MDT specification is the 
   waypoint nodes in MDT and the upstream and downstream SIDs. The 
   specified node is expected to cross connect the SIDs to join the 
   segments together acting in the role of leaf for the upstream segment 
   and root for the downstream segment. 

   When a waypoint in an MDT descriptor does not exist in the IGP, the 
   assumption is that the node identified by the waypoint SID has 
   failed. The response of the other nodes in the system in FIB 
   determination is to add the leaves of the downstream segment to the 
   upstream segment.  

   An example of this would be consider a node "x", and another node 
   "y". At some point in time, "x" advertises a tree that identifies "y" 
   as a waypoint that cross connects upstream SID "a" to downstream SID 
   "b". At some later point node "y" fails. The other nodes in the 
   network will compute segment "a" as if it included all leaves and 
   waypoints in segment "b". All apriori state installed for segment "b"

Internet-Draft   draft-allan-spring-mpls-multicast-03        April 2017 
 

   would be removed as the failure of "y" has required "b" to be 
   subsumed by "a".  

5.2.2. Computation of individual segments 

   FIB generation for a multicast segment is the result of computation, 
   ultimately as applied to all source specific trees in the network. 
   All computing nodes implement a common algorithm for tree generation, 
   as all MUST agree on the solution. 

   One algorithm is as follows: 

   All possible shortest paths to the set of leaves for the MDT is 
   determined. Then pruning rules are repeatedly applied until no 
   further prunes are possible.  

   The philosophy of the application of these rules could be expressed 
   as "simplify as much as possible, and prune that which cannot be". 
   The rules are: 

   1) Eliminate any links and nodes not on a potential shortest path 
     from the root to the leaves for the MDT under consideration. 

   2) Simplify via the replacement of any nodes that do not have a 
     potential role in the MDT with links.  

     This will be nodes that are not a leaf, a root or a candidate 
     replication point. For example: 

         Root---------A----------B 

     B is a leaf. A is not but is in a potential shortest path from root 
     to B. However A will have no role in the MDT that serves B as it 
     provides simple transit therefore is replaced with a direct 
     connection between the root and B. 

         Root--------------------B 

     Note that such pruning also needs to avoid the creation of 
     duplicate parallel links. For example: 

            /----------A----------\ 

         Root                       B 

            \----------C----------/ 


 
Allan et al.,            Expires October 2017                  [Page 8] 
 
Internet-Draft   draft-allan-spring-mpls-multicast-03        April 2017 
 

     Where A and C have no role and the cost root-A-B = cost root-C-B, 
     they can be replaced with a single link from Root to B. 

   3) Simplify via the elimination of fewer hop paths 

     When for a given set of leaves, a node has multiple downstream 
     links that converge on a common downstream point, and that set of 
     leaves is only a subset of the leaves reachable on one or more of 
     the links, any link that only serves that subset of leaves can be 
     pruned. 

     For example: 

       --A---------------------------B 

          \                         /  

            -----------C----------- 

                        \ 

                          ----D 

     Link AB is cost 2, link AC and CB are cost 1 (cost of link CD does 
     not affect the example). 

     B and D are leaves of a root upstream of A. From A, link AB can 
     reach leaf B. Path AC can reach leaf B and D. In this case path A-B 
     can be pruned from consideration. The set of leaves reachable via 
     link A-B is a subset of that reachable by A-C, and the paths from A 
     that serves that subset converges at B. 

   4) Prune upstream links. 

     The normal procedure is to determine the closest upstream leaf or 
     pinned path and then compare all upstream adjacencies with that 
     metric 

        a.  If the upstream adjacency extends closer to the root than 
          the closest leaf or pinned path, then that adjacency can be 
          pruned. 

        b.  If the upstream adjacency extends the same distance towards 
          the root then 

            i. If it is to a non-leaf or pinned path candidate 
               replication point, it can be pruned 

 
Allan et al.,            Expires October 2017                  [Page 9] 
 
Internet-Draft   draft-allan-spring-mpls-multicast-03        April 2017 
 

           ii. If it is to a pinned path, where there are equal upstream 
               adjacencies that terminate on leaves, it can be pruned 
               (considered inferior). 

          iii. If there is more than one "equal" upstream adjacency, 
               that is all terminate on nodes that are on pinned paths, 
               or all terminate on nodes that are leaves, than one is 
               selected. This is via the lowest node ID. 

        c.  If the upstream adjacency is a candidate replication point 
          closer than the closest leaf, and upstream from it is a node 
          that is a leaf or pinned path equidistant with the closest 
          leaf, then all adjacencies that extend to leaves ranked lower 
          than the leaf or pinned path behind the CRP may be pruned. 
          Note that an upstream adjacency that has a CRP closer than 
          the closest leaf or pinned path cannot be pruned. 

        d.  When for a given node all possible upstream adjacencies that 
          can be pruned have been identified, each is removed, and any 
          simplifications that can be performed as a result of the 
          prune are performed. This is the equivalent of a localized 
          check for 2 and 3 above and is then performed iteratively in 
          response to changes to the graph as a result of pruning. 

   The procedure is to implement 1, 2 and 3 above, then loop on 4 until 
   such time as the MDT is fully resolved, or no further prunes are 
   possible. Step 4 is performed in a specific order. The nodes are 
   processed according to a ranking from closest to the root to the 
   farthest, and from lowest node ID to the highest within a given 
   distance from the root. 

   If, at the end of pruning and simplification, all leaves in a 
   multicast segment have a unique shortest path to the root, the tree 
   is considered resolved, and the computation can progress directly to 
   the FIB generation step. 

   If not all leaves have a unique shortest path, additional pruning 
   steps are applied. These steps are NOT guaranteed to produce a lowest 
   cost tree, and therefore require an additional audit and possible 
   modification to ensure when forwarding a maximum of one copy of a 
   packet will traverse an interface. 

   For segments not authoritatively resolved by the above rules, a prune 
   that will not authoritatively result in a minimum cost tree is 
   applied. For the purpose of interoperability, the following rule is 
   proposed: A computing node will select the closest node to the root 
   with a candidate role that does not have a unique shortest path to 

 
Allan et al.,            Expires October 2017                 [Page 10] 
 
Internet-Draft   draft-allan-spring-mpls-multicast-03        April 2017 
 

   the root. Where more than one such node exists, the one with the 
   lowest unicast SID is selected. For that node, the best upstream link 
   is selected and all other upstream links pruned. The best upstream 
   link is defined as the link with the closest node with a candidate 
   role that potentially serves the highest number of leaves. Where 
   there is a tie, once again the node with the lowest SID is selected. 

   Once the links have been pruned, rules 2 through 4 are repeatedly 
   applied until either the tree is fully resolved, or again no further 
   prunes are possible, in which case the next closest remaining 
   unresolved node has the same prune applied. 

   For all segments not resolved by the initial prune rules, they are 
   audited to ensure all nodes that have a role in the tree do not have 
   a node with a role between them and their upstream node on the tree. 
   If they do, the old upstream adjacency is removed, and the superior 
   one added. 

5.3. FIB Generation 

   The topology components that remain at the end of the pruning 
   operation will reflect all nodes that have a role in a given 
   multicast segment plus the necessary tunnels (as all intervening 
   multi-path scenarios will have been simplified away). From this the 
   FIB can be generated: 

   All nodes that have a role in a given multicast segment and have 
   nodes upstream in the segment will need to accept the SID for the MDT 
   from at minimum, all upstream interfaces. 

   All nodes that have a role in a given segment and have nodes 
   immediately downstream in the segment will need to replicate packets 
   simply labelled with the multicast SID onto those interfaces. 

   All nodes that have a role in a given segment and have nodes 
   reachable via a tunnel downstream set the FIB to push the tunnel 
   unicast SID for the downstream node onto any replicated copies of a 
   received packet, and identify the set of interfaces on the shortest 
   path for the tunnel SID. 

5.4. FIB installation 

   FIB installation needs to acknowledge two aspects of the hybrid 
   tunnel and role model of multicast tree construction. The first is 
   that because of the sparse state model simple tree adds, moves, and 
   changes may require the installation of state where it did not 
   previously exist, and such changes may impact existing services. The

   second is that it is possible to retain the knowledge to prioritize 
   computation of those trees impacted the failure of a node with a 
   role. 

   To address this, there are three stages of state installation for 
   multicast convergence: 

   1) Immediate:  

        a.  Installation of state for multicast segments impacted by the 
          failure of a node in the network, and installation of state 
          for segments in nodes that have not previously had a role in 
          the given segment.  

        b.  Installation of state for waypoints in multi-segment MDTs. 

   2) After T1: Update state for nodes that both had and have a role in 
     a given multicast segment. 

   3) After T2: Removal of state for nodes that transition from having a 
     role to not having a role for a given multicast segment. 

   T1 and T2 are network wide configurable values.

   The required IGP changes are documented in [MCAST-ISIS] and [MCAST-
   OPSF]. 

6.2. BGP Extensions 

   This memo will require the specification of a new PMSI Tunnel 
   Attribute (SPRING P2MP tunnel, tentatively 0x09) to order to 
   integrate into the multicast framework documented in RFC 6514 

7. Observations 

   This technique is not confined to segment routing, and with the 
   provision of a global label space (to be employed as per a multicast 
   SID), an MPLS-LDP network would also provide the requisite mesh of 
   unicast tunnels and be capable of implementing this approach to 
   multicast. 

   This memo focuses on an implementation based upon nodes that are IGP 
   speakers and converge independently so is written in a form that

   assumes a node, computing node and IGP speaker are one in the same. 
   It should be observed that the relative frugality of data plane state 
   would suggest that separation of computation from nodes in the data 
   plane combined with management or "software defined networking" based 
   population of the multicast FIB entries may also be useful modes of 
   network operation.
