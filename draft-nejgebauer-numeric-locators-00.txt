Abstract

   This document describes the syntax of numeric character strings,
   called numeric locators or simply locators, which form a hierarchical
   name space where any node except the root can (or, if it is a leaf
   node, must) resolve to a single Uniform Resource Identifier.  It also
   defines a mapping of the locator name space to the Domain Name
   System, which allows the use of the existing DNS infrastructure to
   resolve locators.

1. Introduction

   Accessing an Internet resource, such as a World Wide Web page, often
   involves keying in its Uniform Resource Identifier, which is an
   alphanumeric string.  For a large number of mobile devices, equipped
   only with a numeric keypad, alphabetic text entry is cumbersome, slow

   and error-prone.  Punctuation characters typically encountered in
   URIs, such as the dot and the forward slash, present an additional
   obstacle, as their location on the keypad is not standardized.

   One way to alleviate the problem of manual URI entry is to eliminate
   it altogether by presenting the user with an organized collection of
   hyperlinks to commonly accessed resources.  This approach works well
   in certain contexts, but it is too constraining for a general
   solution; necessarily so, since boundless growth of a hyperlink
   collection would quickly make it unmanageable.

   This document introduces a method for indirect specification of URIs
   through strings called (numeric) locators, which have the following
   characteristics:

   - Numeric representation.  Limiting the character set to decimal
     digits makes manual entry of locators much easier on devices with a
     numeric keypad.  Locator syntax is formally described in Section 2.

   - Hierarchical organization.  Locators form a tree-structured name
     space closely resembling, by design, the structure of the Domain
     Name System.  This makes it possible to define a 1-to-1 mapping
     between locators and domain names, which is done in Section 3.

   - Compactness.  With the organization proposed in Appendix A, a
     typical locator should be no more than 10-12 digits long,
     comparable to the length of an international telephone number.
     Length can be further reduced by using relative locators, specified
     in Section 2.

   Conceptually, a locator can point to a URI, a set of lower-level
   locators, or both.  The root node of the locator name space can only
   contain pointers to first-level locators, and every leaf node must
   resolve to a URI.  Only one URI can be associated with a node, while
   the number of lower-level locators is unlimited.

   The task of retrieving the URI corresponding to a given locator is
   performed by a software component called a resolver.  Several aspects
   of resolver operation are determined by this specification: syntax
   validation of a locator, its transformation to a domain name, and the
   subsequent DNS query for that name.  A resolver can be implemented
   either locally to a device or as a remote procedure, and coupled with
   the user interface in a variety of ways; both considerations are
   outside the scope of this document.

2. Locator Construction and Syntax

   A locator is a hierarchical name composed of a series of labels, each

Internet-Draft          Numeric Locators for URIs             March 2003


   representing one level of the hierarchy.  Labels are written left to
   right, from the least specific (closest to the root) to the most
   specific (farthest from the root).  The digit zero is used as the
   label separator, leaving the other nine digits for label text.
   Labels are one to 63 digits in length; an implicit zero-length label
   denotes the root.

   The digits used for the construction of locators are taken from the
   US-ASCII character set, so the length of a locator in digits equals
   its length in octets.  This does not preclude the use of other sets
   of decimal numerals in the user interface, but in such cases
   conversion to the US-ASCII representation is required before the
   locator is passed on to the resolver.

   The formal locator syntax is defined by a BNF-like grammar, taken
   from [RFC2396].  Briefly, rules are separated from definitions by an
   equal sign "=", literals are quoted with "", parentheses "(" and ")"
   are used to group elements, alternatives are designated by "|", and
   elements may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions
   of the following element; n defaults to 0.

   There are two forms of locators: absolute and relative.  Without
   explicit qualification, a locator is understood to be absolute.  An
   absolute locator starts at the root and ends with the most specific
   label.  The total length of a locator is limited to 240 digits.

      locator = 1*(separator label)

      separator = "0"

      label = 1*label_text

      label_text = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

   A relative locator starts with a label at some level below the root
   and continues to the most specific label.  It can be transformed to
   an absolute locator by prepending it with the appropriately formatted
   string, called an origin.

      relative_locator = label *(separator label)

      origin = *(separator label) separator

   The relative-to-absolute transformation is performed by the resolver,
   which has to be configured with the appropriate value for the origin.
   In the absence of such configuration, the resolver must signal an
   error to its caller if presented with a relative locator.

3. Locators and the Domain Name System

   Locators are designed for integration into the DNS, hence the
   similarity in terminology and the compatibility of label syntax and
   length limits.  A locator can be unambiguously transformed to a
   domain name if the following differences between locators and domain
   names are compensated for:

   - The labels of a locator are written from the least specific to the
     most specific, exactly the reverse of the order specified in
     [RFC1034] for the labels of a domain name.

   - Locators use the digit zero as a separator, while domain names use
     the dot.

   - All locator labels start with a digit, while Section 2.1 of
     [RFC1123] requires the highest-level label of a domain name to
     start with an alphabetic character, in order to make domain names
     distinguishable from dotted-decimal IPv4 addresses.

   Taking these issues into account, the transformation of a locator to
   a domain name consists of the following conceptual operations:

   - The order of the labels is reversed.  Each label is followed by a
     separator.

   - The digit zero is replaced with a dot throughout the resulting
     string.

   - An alphabetic label is appended to the resulting name.  That label
     represents a special top-level domain which is necessary to anchor
     the locator-derived names to the DNS hierarchy.  This specification
     uses the LOCATOR top-level domain for that purpose.

   For example, transforming the locator:

      0110392675301

   produces the domain name:

      1.3926753.11.locator

   The URI corresponding to a locator is stored in the DNS as the value
   of the TXT RR (see [RFC1035]) associated with the domain name derived
   from that locator.  After computing the domain name from a locator,
   the resolver issues a DNS query for that name with QTYPE set to TXT,
   acting as a DNS stub resolver.  The standard resolution algorithm of
   [RFC1034] is followed, with the difference that a response with

Internet-Draft          Numeric Locators for URIs             March 2003


   multiple TXT records is treated as an error.

   Below is an example of a complete DNS zone containing the mapping for
   the locator "0110392675301":

      $ORIGIN 3926753.11.locator.
      @               SOA ns.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                          2003030101 3600 3600 604800 86400 )
                      NS  ns.example.com.
                      NS  backup.example.com.

      1               TXT "http://www.example.com/news"

   The appearance of names from the domain "example.com" in this zone is
   not arbitrary: the example follows the organization of Appendix A and
   assumes that the same administrative entity is the authority for
   "example.com" and "3926753.11.locator".

4. Security Considerations

   Locator resolution depends on the DNS and inherits its security
   concerns, such as spoofing and denial of service.  The use of
   locators presents an additional opportunity for DNS-based attacks,
   since URI retrieval will typically be followed by a DNS query for the
   server named in the URI.

   URIs are a general resource naming mechanism, and might identify
   resources and functions local to the requestor, including those
   which, when accessed, invoke operations with non-negligible side
   effects (e.g., initiating a telephone call or sending a network
   message, both of which are charged for.)  A locator could resolve to
   a "dangerous" URI either through spoofing, or due to malicious or
   erroneous configuration.

Appendix A: Organization of the Locator Name Space

   The locator name space is distinct from that of the DNS, and could be
   organized in an arbitrarily incompatible way.  However, in the
   interests of easing the administrative burden of locator management
   and making the use of locators acceptable performance-wise, it is
   beneficial to keep the two name spaces closely aligned.

   To that end, two organizational rules for locator assignment and
   management are specified.  The first rule sets the requirements for
   assigning a locator label to a requestor, namely:

   - The requestor must have an ordinary DNS domain registered in the
     DNS.  This is intended to reduce the potential for locator abuse,
     and is the basis of the next requirement.

   - The zone of the requested locator label must have the same
     authority information (SOA MNAME and RNAME fields and NS RRs) as
     the zone of the ordinary DNS domain of the requestor.  Furthermore,
     the NS RRs must have the same TTL values in both zones.

     The locators defined by the requestor are expected to identify URIs
     pointing to its DNS name space.  If a locator is successfully
     resolved, the NS records for its zone will typically be cached by
     the DNS resolver performing the query, and available for querying
     the domain name of the server pointed to by the URI.

   The other rule defines a 1-to-1 mapping between top-level domains and
   first-level locator labels by providing a numeric equivalent for each
   TLD.  Generic TLD (gTLD) mappings are shown in Table 1.

                     Table 1: gTLD Numeric Equivalents

                        com     11      aero    111
                        edu     12      biz     112
                        gov     13      coop    113
                        int     14      info    114
                        mil     15      museum  115
                        net     16      name    116
                        org     17      pro     117

   Labels starting with "1" are reserved for gTLD mapping.

   Country-code TLD (ccTLD) equivalents are three-digit strings,
   starting from "211" and proceeding sequentially.  The next label in
   sequence is obtained by taking the integer value of a label,
   incrementing it until the result has no zeros in its decimal
   representation, and converting the resulting value back to a string.
