Abstract

   The current BGP specification calls for sending prefix based routing
   information when a BGP peer fails to all other peers so that they
   could converge using the new information.

   Certain network events could be communicated to BGP speakers in an
   aggregated fashion.  This not only minimizes control plane traffic
   but more importantly reduces the time to react to these events by the

   network and consequently reduces the time to converge.

   This draft suggests extensions to the protocol to react to such
   events in a concise manner.In this version of the document the scope
   of the propagation will be contained to a single domain.

2.  Introduction

   In most of today's BGP deployments the external peer's failures
   results (on the ASBR or a PE node) in the best path calculation
   followed by the per prefix native BGP signaling of a new path or a
   withdraw message if no other path is available.

   In this proposal we recommend the enhancement to this traditional
   paradigm.  In parallel to per prefix signaling the proposal suggests
   creation of hierarchy.  While permitting the traditional BGP
   mechanism of per prefix signaling to proceed at it's own pace we
   define an abstraction value (VLID) which will be assigned on a per
   peer basis and signaled immediately following peer's link failure or
   peer's node failure event.

   The most important benefit of this behavior is to trigger the
   alternate path computation on all BGP speakers domain wide.  This
   reduces the time taken to flood the event to a single message
   propagation delay in the network and makes the protocol messaging as
   well as convergence invariant of the number of prefixes involved.

3.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]

4.  Applicability

   EFP provides toolset to speed up remote critical failure detection
   impacting current data paths without the necessity to modify
   forwarding plane.  It also eliminates even temporary occurrences of
   any sub optimal routing which is not avoidable in any tunnel based
   protection solutions.  That is achived by triggering switchover to an
   alternative exit points on all BGP speakers including the ingress
   nodes to the domain thus assuring the optimal BGP path selection
   execution.

   This solution should be able to address all of the below operational
   and deployment scenarios:

   o  IPv4/IPv6 forwarding without next hop self on ASBR
   o  IPv4/IPv6 forwarding with next hop self on ASBRs
   o  IPv4/Ipv6 forwarding with native or tunneled core
   o  VPNv4/VPNv6 remote CE failure (directly connected p2p to PE)
   o  VPNv4/VPNv6 remote CE failure (multihop connected p2p to PE)
   o  VPNv4/VPNv6 remote CE failure (connected via multi-access to PE)
   o  VPNv4/VPNv6 PE-CE link failure (Point to point  or multi-access)
   o  VPNv4/VPNv6 PE failure

   The solution should work equally well for BGP learned routes or
   redistributed locally by the border edge router.

5.  VLID allocation

   In order to be able to later detect and map various failure scenarios
   to BGP routing information a proper marking is necessary to take
   place ahead of failure time on externally received routes via EBGP or
   at the redistribution from any other routing protocol.

   We first examine the following failure types:

   a.  CE node failure
   b.  PE-CE link failure
   c.  PE/ASBR failure

   The link/node liveness detection of the peer can be done using: IGP
   hellos, BFD, physical link failures or even highly discouraged but
   still used in practice low BGP keepalive interval.  This document

   does not mandate the use of any of them leaving the trigger itself to
   the implementation or customer choice.  All of the above triggers
   should be supported with the proposed extension.

   In today's networks next hop handling for external routes can be
   divided into two operational scenarios:

   o  Setting next to self hop on PE/ASBR
   o  Not setting next hop on PE/ASBR and redistributing peer's next hop
      into local IGP

   Note that some applications may force user to set next hop on the
   edge of the autonomous system (for example 2547).  In the case of PE/
   ASBR failure when set next hop self operation has occurred on ingress
   to the AS the failure propagation of entire node can be accomplished
   by the IGP flooding.  In some IGP topologies next hop leaking between
   IGP areas/levels is necessary.  The same IGP based event propagation
   can also be used to signal external next hop liveness when no next
   hop self set action occurred at the AS boundary.

   In all other failure cases there needs to be a functional component
   which is responsible for association on a per BGP process basis (per
   each independent BGP instance with it's own BGP router id), a unique
   value to received route's here called VLID.  Such value will
   represent remote links and peering devices.  The term link here
   represents a virtual link and not a physical one.

   For point to point interface types virtual link may map directly to
   physical/logical link, but on the multi-access interfaces an
   abstraction layer will be required which will map CE node to each
   virtual link value even if physical medium is shared between a number
   of CEs connected to PE.

   Such an abstraction also will address all flavors of multihop access
   techniques as long as proper detection is in place to notice a
   failure in a timely fashion.

6.  VLID association to routes and their propagation

   The meaning of virtual links IDs is valid only with conjunction with
   the VL's originator BGP router-id within a given Autonomous System.

   BGP Virtual Link IDs should not be propagated via EBGP sessions,
   unless operator allows propagation of unchanged next hops for a given
   EBGP peering.

   BGP Virtual Link IDs shall not be propagated to those BGP speakers
   who did not indicated EFP BGP capability.

   A new BGP Virtual Link Attribute is defined to carry information
   about allocated Virtual Link ID from a BGP speaker to all NLRIs
   present in corresponding MP_REACH_NLRI attribute.


     The format of the new BGP Virtual Link Attribute is defined
    in Figure 1:

   The VL ID assignment scheme can be as flexible as an implementation

   represent various node's failure scenarios.  Since the VLIDs have
   only local significance the specification of many flavors of their
   definitions is not necessary for proper protocol operation.

7.  VLID signaling

7.1  Analysis of propagation options

   There are multiple means external events encoded in VLIDs could be
   propagated via an AS to other BGP speakers.  We considered options to
   use IGPs for flooding, forms of reliable multicast flooding as well
   as new BGP sub-address family.  The last one has been chosen for
   following reasons:

   o  Selective reception of external failure state by only those BGP
      speakers who require this type of information
   o  Easy propagation via entire domain including transit via different
      IGP areas or levels
   o  Elimination of unnecessary transit points to avoid increased
      propagation delays
   o  Containment of the solution within a single protocol thereby
      eliminating the need for multiple protocols (and hence multiple
      components within a router) to interact with each other to
      implement this scheme.  It keeps the solution and its
      implementation simple.

7.2  Encoding

   Virtual link's state information will be propagated across given
   domain with a new SAFI.  Manually or automatically created new BGP
   peering sessions will be required to be established.

   The type code for the new EFP SAFI will be assigned (TBD).

   The NLRI format for the new EFP SAFI is represented as [BGP_Rtr_ID:
   VL_ID] where BGP Rtr ID is a 4 octet value indicating BGP router ID
   of the BGP speaker who originated VL's and 6 octet VL IDs
   representing the allocated identifiers for external links or peering
   nodes.

   The minimum length of EFP NLRI can contain just the BGP Rtr ID value
   (length of 4 octets) indicating that any prefixes originated by this
   node will need to be invalidated regardless of the VL_ID value they
   carry (application example: controlled reload of one of BGP processes
   during planned maintenance without impacting IGP).

   The max NLRI length can be of the size of 10 octets.

   The new BGP capability msg has been defined to signal EFP capability
   between BGP speakers.  Each BGP speaker that wishes to participate in
   the new EFP address family must use the Multiprotocol Extensions
   Capability Code as defined in [BGP-MP] to advertise the new EFP (AFI,



Raszuk, et al.           Expires January 3, 2006                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   EFP-BGP                       July 2005


   SAFI) pair.

   A BGP speaker participating in the distribution of EFP information
   and configured as Route Reflector should prioritize distribution of
   the VL information against it's other BGP data processing to avoid
   any delays for remote peers to get the convergence critical
   information in a timely fashion.

   When implementation supports on a per BGP address family processing
   prioritization EFP address family should have the highest priority.
   This is recommended mostly for two reasons:

   o  Any other AF may depend on it's information
   o  The amount of information required to be send should be much
      smaller then the amount of corresponding prefixes to be processed
      and propagated.

   Support of new EFP address family shall automatically indicate
   support for handling BGP optional non-transitive EFP Virtual Link
   Attribute.

7.3  Message ordering protection

   To support the deployment model of propagating the new EFP AFI/SAFI
   via an existing route reflectors in order to accommodate for possible
   bgp message propagation delays and update reordering, a 2 octet value
   counter has been defined.  It's main role is to assure that BGP
   reacts only to the latest event and not delayed one (out of sequence)
   due to some propagation problems in the network.

   The counter shall restart when max has been reached from the value of
   1.  The counter should only be consulted while processing updates for
   the already existed VL NLRIs in the BGP RIB.  When the value is lower
   then already existing for a given VL NLRI the incoming update should
   be dropped and no new BGP action taken.  The exception to this rule
   will be present when the incoming message contains the value of 1 and
   the value of previous message has not reached two octet maximum.
   Such a situation will take place when the originator restarts and in
   this case we should not impact already advertised prefixes before the
   normal BGP route propagation would have taken place.

   We define a new BGP community type called Virtual Links Counter
   community to carry associated virtual link counter value Figure 1.
   The Virtual Links Counter Community is of an extended type.

   Virtual Links Counter is a new type of BGP Extended Community
   Attribute.  It is a non transitive in the AS scope and in the same
   time transitive in a per bgp speaker scope within the domain.  In

   analogy to a non transitive EFP Attribute it is allowed to be
   propagated across EBGP sessions only when next-hop is preservation
   has been configured on such a session by the operator.

   It carries two octet counter for the associated VL NLRIs in the
   corresponding MP_REACH_NLRI attribute and is only allocated on the
   ASBR/PE nodes.

   The value of the high-order octet of the Type Field is 0x40.  The
   value of the low-order octet of the Type field for this community is
   (TBD).  The value of the Global Administrator sub-field (2 octets) is
   used to carry the VL counter.

8.  Operation

8.1  BGP paths redundancy requirement

   In order to make an instant switching decision at the egress nodes
   the ingress node has to propagate best external path to all of his
   IBGP peers along with the associated VL IDs.

   In the case where there is more then one path in the BGP VRF table
   (including VRF zero) received from different peer a second best path
   along with it's own VL ID is advised to be propagated.  In such a
   case even for different RDs per vrf RRs would need to support
   ADD_PATH and not eliminate path distribution by propagating only the
   best one to it's clients.  Not propagating second best path may
   result in unnecessary loss of connectivity not greater then would be
   today but easy to highly minimize when employing second best and EFP
   approach.

8.2  VLID propagation via route reflectors

   In traditional IP based switching route reflectors if deployed need
   to propagate more then a single best path.  That can be accomplished



Raszuk, et al.           Expires January 3, 2006                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   EFP-BGP                       July 2005


   with the use of ADD Paths scheme.

   For some address families in particular 2547 the same can be
   accomplished by configuring different RD per vrf on all PEs.  No
   additional changes will be required on RRs.

8.3  Sequence of events

   The following events are expected to happen at the failure scenario:

   a.  Each PE allocates a VLID to each received path from remote CEs/
       ASBRs
   b.  BGP marks the received routes from a external peers by adding the
       new Virtual Link attribute to the update messages
   c.  Each PE advertises by IBGP best external path for a given vrf
       (incl VRF0).
   d.  For non 2547 networks route reflectors if used need to be able to
       fwd more then only best path received from the ASBRs (use of ADD-
       PATH [10] recommended).  For 2547 application that extesion to
       route reflectors is not required When different RD allocation per
       vrf recommendation is in place.  That extension is also not
       required when route reflectors are not used for given AFI/SAFI.
   e.  On the event of any PE-CE link failure or CE node failure PE/ASBR
       signals transitioned VL IDs state in MP_UNREACH_NLRI and
       propagates them via iBGP new EFP AFI/SAFI to the peers
   f.  BGP Rtr ID + VL ID length pair uniquely identifies invalid paths
       and triggers local switchover to other paths for a given prefix.
   g.  For the transition period sender will also follow up with the
       traditional per prefix withdraw or update message.  When the
       network wide deployment of routers supporting EFP is assured the
       need for origination and propagation of per prefix withdraws
       following EFP signaling could be eliminated.

9.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing IBGP [2].

10.  IANA Consideration

   The following type codes have to be allocated by the current
   allocation rules:

   o  New attribute type code for BGP Virtual Link Attribute
   o  New SAFI value for the new EFP SAFI
   o  New type code for the Virtual Link Counter BGP Extended community
