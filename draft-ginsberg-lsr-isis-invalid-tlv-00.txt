                     Invalid TLV Handling in IS-IS
                 draft-ginsberg-lsr-isis-invalid-tlv-00

Abstract

   Key to the extensibility of the Intermediate System to Intermediate
   System (IS-IS) protocol has been the handling of unsupported and/or
   invalid Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples.  Although there are explicit
   statements in existing specifications, in some cases the expected
   behavior is "well known" but not explicitly stated.

   This document discusses the "well known behaviors" and makes them
   explicit in order to insure that interoperability is maximized.

   This document when approved updates RFC3563, RFC5305, and RFC6233.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.  Introduction

   The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol
   utilizes Type/Length/Value (TLV) encoding for all content in the body
   of Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  New extensions to the protocol are
   supported by defining new TLVs.  In order to allow protocol
   extensions to be deployed in a backwards compatible way an
   implementation is required to ignore TLVs that it does not
   understand.  This behavior is also applied to sub-TLVs, which are
   contained within TLVs.

   A corollary to ignoring unknown TLVs is having the validation of PDUs
   be independent from the validation of the TLVs contained in the PDU.
   PDUs which are valid MUST be accepted even if an individual TLV
   contained within that PDU is invalid in some way.

Internet-Draft     draft-ginsberg-lsr-iiss-inva;id-tlv      October 2018


   These behaviors are specified in existing protocol documents -
   principally [ISO10589] and [RFC5305].  In addition, the set of TLVs
   (and sub-TLVs) which are allowed in each PDU type is documented in
   the TLV Codepoints Registry ( https://www.iana.org/assignments/isis-
   tlv-codepoints/isis-tlv-codepoints.xhtml ) established by [RFC3563]
   and updated by [RFC6233] and [RFC7356].

   Nevertheless, a certain degree of "common knowledge" is assumed on
   the part of implementors in regards to these behaviors.

   This document serves to make explicit what is expected.  While it
   does not alter any existing protocol behavior or specifications, it
   is intended to close any gaps between what is explicitly stated and
   what has been "commonly understood".  Although existing protocol
   behavior is not changed, the clarifications contained in this
   document serve as updates to RFC 3563 (see Section 2), RFC 5304, and
   RFC 6233 (see Section 3).

2.  TLV Codepoints Registry

   [RFC3563] established the IANA managed IS-IS TLV Codepoints Registry
   for recording assigned TLV code points.  The registry can be found at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/isis-tlv-codepoints/isis-tlv-
   codepoints.xhtml . The initial contents of this registry were based
   on [RFC3359].

   The registry includes a set of columns indicating in which PDU types
   a given TLV is allowed:

   IIH - TLV is allowed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System
   Hello (IIH) PDUs (Point-to-point and LAN)

   LSP - TLV is allowed in Link State PDUs (LSP)

   SNP - TLV is allowed in Sequence Number PDUs (SNP) (Partial Sequence
   Number PDUs (PSNP) and Complete Sequence Number PDUS (CSNP))

   Purge - TLV is allowed in LSP Purges [RFC6233]

   If "Y" is entered in a column it means the TLV is allowed in the
   corresponding PDU type.

   If "N" is entered in a column it means the TLV is NOT allowed in the
   corresponding PDU type.

3.  TLV Acceptance in PDUs

   This section describes the correct behavior when a PDU is received
   which contains a TLV which is specified as NOT allowed in the TLV
   Codepoints Registry.

3.1.  Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received PDUs

   When a PDU is received and it contains a TLV which is NOT allowed in
   that PDU the expected behavior is defined in [ISO10589] which states
   (see Sections 9.3 - 9.13):

   "Any codes in a received PDU that are not recognised shall be
   ignored."

   Therefore the presence of TLVs in a PDU which are not allowed MUST
   NOT cause the PDU itself to be rejected by the receiving IS.

3.2.  Special Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received Purges

   When purging LSPs [ISO10589] recommends (but does not require) the
   body of the LSP (i.e., all TLVs) be removed before generating the
   purge.  LSP purges which have TLVs in the body are accepted though
   any TLVs which are present "MUST" be ignored.

   When cryptographic authentication [RFC5304] was introduced, this
   looseness when processing received purges had to be addressed in
   order to prevent attackers from being able to initiate a purge
   without having access to the authentication key.  [RFC5304] therefore
   imposed strict requirements on what TLVs were allowed in a purge
   (authentication only) and specified that:

   "ISes MUST NOT accept purges that contain TLVs other than the
   authentication TLV".

   This behavior was extended by [RFC6233] which added the "Purge"
   column to the TLV Codepoints registry to identify all the TLVs which
   are allowed in purges.

   The behavior specified in [RFC5304] is not backwards compatible with
   the behavior defined by [ISO10589] and therefore can only be safely
   enabled when all nodes support cryptographic authentication.
   Similarly, the extensions defined by [RFC6233] are not compatible
   with the behavior defined in [RFC5304], therefore can only be safely
   enabled when all nodes support the extensions.

3.3.  Applicability to sub-TLVs

   [RFC5305] introduced sub-TLVs, which are TLV tuples advertised within
   the body of a parent TLV.  Registries associated with sub-TLVs are
   associated with the TLV Codepoints Registry and specify in which TLVs
   a given sub-TLV is allowed.  As with TLVs, it is required that sub-
   TLVs which are NOT allowed MUST be ignored on receipt.

4.  TLV Validation and LSP Acceptance

   The correct format of a TLV and its associated sub-TLVs if applicable
   are defined in the document(s) which introduce each codepoint.
   Definition SHOULD include what action to take when the format/content
   of the TLV does not conform to the specification (e.g., "MUST be
   ignored on receipt").  When making use of the information encoded in
   a given TLV (or sub-TLV) receiving nodes MUST verify that the TLV
   conforms to the standard definition.  This includes cases where the
   length of a TLV/sub-TLV is incorrect and/or cases where the value
   field does not conform to the defined restrictions.

   However, the unit of flooding for the IS-IS Update process is an LSP.
   The presence of a TLV (or sub-TLV) the content of which does not
   conform to the relevant specification MUST NOT cause the LSP itself
   to be rejected.  Failure to follow this requirement will result in
   inconsistent LSP Databases on different nodes in the network which
   will compromise the correct operation of the protocol.

   LSP Acceptance rules are specified in [ISO10589] .  Acceptance rules
   for LSP purges are extended by [RFC5304] [RFC5310] and further
   extended by [RFC6233].

   [ISO10589] also specifies the behavior when an LSP is not accepted.
   This behavior is NOT altered by extensions to the LSP Acceptance
   rules i.e., regardless of the reason for the rejection of an LSP the
   Update process on the receiving router takes the same action.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the TLV Codepoints Registry to reference
   this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   As this document makes no changes to the protocol there are no
   security issues introduced.

   Security concerns for IS-IS are discussed in [ISO10589], [RFC5304],
   and [RFC5310].
