  Signaling Entropy Label Capability and Entropy Readable Label-stack
                            Depth Using OSPF
                      draft-ietf-ospf-mpls-elc-07

Abstract

   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load
   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress Label
   Switching Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into a
   given tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it
   has the capability of processing ELs, referred to as Entropy Label
   Capability (ELC), on that tunnel.  In addition, it would be useful
   for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability of reading the maximum
   label stack depth and performing EL-based load-balancing, referred to
   as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD), in the cases where stacked
   LSPs are used for whatever reasons.  This document defines mechanisms
   to signal these two capabilities using OSPF.  These mechanisms are
   useful when the label advertisement is also done via OSPF.  In
   addition, this document introduces the Non-IGP Functional
   Capabilities TLV for advertising OSPF router's actual non-IGP
   functional capabilities.  ELC is one of such non-IGP functional
   capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6790] describes a method to load balance Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  [RFC6790]
   introduces the concept of Entropy Label Capability (ELC) and defines
   the signalings of this capability via MPLS signaling protocols.
   Recently, mechanisms are being defined to signal labels via link-
   state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) such as OSPF

Internet-Draft     Signalling ELC and ERLD using OSPF     September 2018


   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].  In such scenario, the
   signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC6790] are inadequate.  This draft
   defines a mechanism to signal the ELC [RFC6790] using OSPF.  This
   mechanism is useful when the label advertisement is also done via
   OSPF.

   In addition, in the cases where stacked LSPs are used for whatever
   reasons (e.g., SR-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls]), it
   would be useful for ingress LSRs to know each intermediate LSR's
   capability of reading the maximum label stack depth and performing
   EL-based load-balancing.  This capability, referred to as Entropy
   Readable Label Depth (ERLD) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-spring-entropy-label] may be used by ingress LSRs to
   determine whether it's necessary to insert an EL for a given LSP of
   the stacked LSP tunnel in the case where there has already been at
   least one EL in the label stack [I-D.ietf-mpls-spring-entropy-label].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6790] and [RFC7770].

3.  Non-OSPF Functional Capabilities TLV

   This document defines the Router Non-IGP Functional Capabilities TLV
   with TLV type code of TBD1 within the body of the OSPF Router
   Information LSA.  An OSPF router advertising an OSPF RI LSA MAY
   include the Router Non-IGP Functional Capabilities TLV.  If included,
   it MUST be included in the first instance of the LSA.  Additionally,
   the TLV MUST reflect the advertising OSPF router's actual non-IGP
   functional capabilities in the flooding scope of the containing OSPF
   RI LSA.

   The format of the Router Non-OSPF Functional Capabilities TLV is as
   follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           Type=TBD1           |            Length             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                 Non-IGP Functional Capabilities               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             Figure 1: Non-OSPF Functional Capabilities TLV Format

      Type: TBD1.

      Length: Indicates the length of the value portion in octets and
      will be a multiple of 4 octets dependent on the number of

      capabilities advertised.  Initially, the length will be 4,
      denoting 4 octets of Non-IGP Functional Capabilities Bits as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc].

      Value: contains the Non-IGP Functional Capabilities Bits as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc].

   The Non-IGP Functional Capabilities TLV MAY be followed by optional
   TLVs that further specify a non-OSPF functional capability.  In
   contrast to the OSPF Router Functional Capabilities TLV, the non-OSPF
   functional capabilities advertised in this TLV have no impact on the
   OSPF protocol operation.  The specifications for non-IGP functional
   capabilities advertised in this TLV MUST describe protocol behavior
   and address backwards compatibility.

4.  Advertising ELC Using OSPF

   One bit of the Non-IGP Functional Capability Bits for is used to
   indicate the ELC.

   Assignment of a Non-IGP Functional Capability Bit for the ELC is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc].

   If a router has multiple line cards, the router MUST NOT announce the
   ELC [RFC6790] unless all of its linecards are capable of processing
   ELs.

   How to apply the ELC advertisement to the inter-area, inter-AS and
   inter-protocol scenarios is outside the scope of this document.

5.  Advertising ERLD Using OSPF

   A new MSD-type of the Node MSD sub-TLV
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-msd], called ERLD is defined to
   advertise the ERLD of a given router.  The scope of the advertisement
   depends on the application.

   Assignment of a MSD-Type for ERLD is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc].

   If a router has multiple linecards with different capabilities of
   reading the maximum label stack deepth, the router MUST advertise the
   smallest one.

   This document requests IANA to allocate one TLV type from the OSPF RI
   TLVs registry for the Non-IGP Functional CapabilitiesTLV.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations as described in [RFC7770] is applicable
