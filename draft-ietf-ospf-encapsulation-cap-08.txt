1.  Introduction

   Networks use tunnels for a variety of reasons, such as:

   o  Partial deployment of IPv6 in IPv4 networks or IPv4 in IPv6
      networks as described in [RFC5565], where IPvx tunnels are used
      between IPvx-enabled routers so as to traverse non-IPvx routers.

   o  Remote Loop-Free Alternate (RLFA) repair tunnels as described in
      [RFC7490], where tunnels are used between the Point of Local
      Repair and the selected PQ node.

   The tunnel encapsulator router needs to select a type of tunnel which
   is supported by the tunnel decapsulator router.  This document
   defines how to advertise, in OSPF Router Information Link State
   Advertisement (LSAs), the list of tunnel encapsulations supported by
   the tunnel decapsulator.  In this document, OSPF refers to both
   OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7770].

3.  Tunnel Encapsulations TLV

   Routers advertise their supported tunnel encapsulation type(s) by
   advertising a new TLV of the OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA
   [RFC7770], referred to as the Tunnel Encapsulations TLV.  This TLV is
   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

   The Type code of the Tunnel Encapsulations is TBD1, the Length value
   is variable, and the Value field contains one or more Tunnel Sub-TLVs
   as defined in Section 4.  Each Tunnel Type Sub-TLV indicates a
   particular encapsulation format that the advertising router supports
   along with the parameters corresponding to the tunnel type.

   The Tunnel Encapsulations TLV MAY appear more than once within a
   given OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA.  If the Tunnel
   Encapsulations TLV appears more than once in an OSPF Router
   Information LSA, the set of all Tunnel Sub-TLVs from all Tunnel
   Encapsulations TLV SHOULD be considered.  The scope of the
   advertisement depends on the application but it is recommended that
   it SHOULD be domain-wide.

4.  Tunnel Sub-TLV

   The Tunnel Sub-TLV is structured as follows:

      Tunnel Type (2 octets): Identifies the type of tunneling
      technology signaled.  Tunnel types are shared with the BGP
      extension [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] and hence are defined in
      the IANA registry "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel
      Types".  Unknown Tunnel types are to be ignored upon receipt.

      Length (2 octets): Unsigned 16-bit integer indicating the total
      number of octets of the value field.

      Value (variable): Zero or more Tunnel Parameter Sub-TLVs as
      defined in Section 5.

   If a Tunnel Sub-TLV is invalid, it MUST be ignored and skipped.
   However, other Tunnel Sub-TLVs MUST be considered

5.  Tunnel Parameter Sub-TLVs

   A Tunnel Parameter Sub-TLV is structured as follows:

              +---------------------------------------------+
              |   Tunnel Parameter Sub-Type   (2 Octets)    |
              +---------------------------------------------+
              |   Tunnel Parameter Length (2 Octets)        |
              +---------------------------------------------+
              |   Tunnel Parameter Value  (Variable)        |
              |                                             |
              +---------------------------------------------+

      Tunnel Parameter Sub-Type (2 octets): Each sub-type defines a
      certain parameter of the Tunnel Type TLV that contains this Sub-
      TLV.  Types are registered in the IANA registry "OSPF Tunnel
      Parameter Sub-TLVs" Section 7.2.

      Tunnel Parameter Length (2 octets): Unsigned 16-bit integer
      indicating the total number of octets of the Sub-TLV value field.

      Tunnel Parameter Value (variable): Encodings of the value field
      depend on the Sub-TLV type as enumerated above.  The following
      sub-sections define the encoding in detail.

   Any unknown Tunnel Parameter Sub-Type MUST be ignored and skipped
   upon receipt.  When a reserved value (See Section 7.2) is seen in an
   LSA, it MUST be treated as an invalid Tunnel Parameter Sub-TLV.  When
   a Tunnel Parameter Value has an incorrect syntax of semantic, it MUST
   be treated as an invalid Tunnel Parameter Sub-TLV.  If a Tunnel
   Parameter Sub-TLV is invalid, its Tunnel Sub-TLV MUST be ignored.
   However, other Tunnel Sub-TLVs MUST be considered.

5.1.  Encapsulation Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV type is 1.  The syntax, semantic, and usage of its value
   field are defined in Section 3.2 "Encapsulation Sub-TLVs for
   Particular Tunnel Types" of [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

5.2.  Protocol Type Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV type is 2.  The syntax, semantic, and usage of its value
   field are defined in Section 3.4.1 "Protocol Type sub-TLV" of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

5.3.  Endpoint Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV type is 3.  The value field carries the Network Address
   to be used as tunnel destination address.

   If length is 4, the tunnel endpoint is an IPv4 address.

   If length is 16, the tunnel endpoint is an IPv6 address.

5.4.  Color Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV is of type 4.  The value field is a 4-octet opaque
   unsigned integer.

   The color value is user-defined and configured locally on the
   advertising routers.  It may be used by service providers to define
   policies on the tunnel encapsulator routers, for example, to control
   the selection of the tunnel to use.

   This color value can be referenced by BGP routes carrying Color
   Extended Community [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].  If the tunnel is
   used to reach the BGP Next-Hop of BGP routes, then attaching a Color
   Extended Community to those routes express the willingness of the BGP
   speaker to use a tunnel of the same color.

5.5.  Load-Balancing Block Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV type is 5.  The syntax, semantic, and usage of its value
   field are defined in [RFC5640].

5.6.  IP QoS Field

   This Sub-TLV type is 6.  The syntax, semantic, and usage of its value
   field are defined in Section 3.3.1 "IPv4 DS Field" of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

5.7.  UDP Destination Port

   This Sub-TLV type is 7.  The syntax, semantic, and usage of its value
   field are defined in Section 3.3.2 "UDP Destination Port" of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

6.  Operation

   The advertisement of a Tunnel Encapsulations Sub-TLV indicates that
   the advertising router supports a particular tunnel decapsulation
   along with the parameters to be used for the tunnel.  The decision to
   use that tunnel is driven by the capability of the tunnel
   encapsulator router to support the encapsulation type and the policy
   on the tunnel encapsulator router.  The Color Sub-TLV (See
   Section 5.4) may be used as an input to this policy.  Note that some
   tunnel types may require the execution of an explicit tunnel setup
   protocol before they can be used to transit data.

   A tunnel MUST NOT be used if there is no route toward the IP address
   specified in the Endpoint Sub-TLV (See Section 5.3) or if the route
   is not advertised by the router advertising this Tunnel Sub-TLV.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  OSPF Router Information

   This document requests IANA to allocate a new code point from the
   OSPF Router Information (RI) registry.

7.2.  Tunnel Parameter Sub-TLVs Registry

   This document requests IANA to create, under "Open Shortest Path
   First (OSPF) Parameters", a new registry "OSPF Tunnel Parameter Sub-
   TLVs" with the following registration procedure:

      The values in the range 1-34999 are to be allocated using the
      "Standards Action" registration procedure as defined in [RFC8126].

      The values in the range 35000-65499 are to be allocated using the
      "First Come, First Served" registration procedure.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations applicable to softwires can be found in the
   mesh framework [RFC5565].  In general, security issues of the tunnel
   protocols signaled through this OSPF capability extension are
   inherited.

   If a third-party is able to modify any of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data
   packets may end up getting misrouted, mis-delivered, and/or dropped.
   However, since an OSPF routing domain is usually a well-controlled
   network under a single administrative domain, the possibility of the
   above attack is very low.
