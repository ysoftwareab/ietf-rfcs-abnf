3. Introduction 
 
   LDP [RFC5036] has been deployed for setting up point-to-point (P2P) 
   and multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs, in order to offer point-to-point 
   services in MPLS backbones. 
    
   There are emerging requirements for supporting delivery of point-to-
   multipoint applications in MPLS backbones, such as those defined in 
   [RFC4834] and [L2VPN-MCAST-REQ].  
    
   This requires mechanisms for setting up point-to-multipoint LSPs 
   (P2MP LSP), i.e. LSPs with one Ingress LSR, a set of Egress LSRs, and 
   with MPLS traffic replication at some Branch LSRs. 
 
   RSVP-TE extensions for setting up Point-To-Multipoint Traffic 
   Engineered LSPs (P2MP TE LSPs), have been defined in [RFC4875]. 
   They meet requirements expressed in [RFC4461]. This approach is 
   useful, in network environments where P2MP Traffic Engineering 
   capabilities are needed (Optimization, QoS, Fast recovery).  
 
   However for operators who want to support point-to-multipoint traffic 
   delivery on an MPLS backbone, without Traffic Engineering needs, and 
   have already deployed LDP for P2P traffic, an interesting and useful 
   approach would be to rely on LDP extensions in order to setup point-
   to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs. This would bring consistency with P2P MPLS 
   applications and would ease the delivery of point-to-multipoint 
   services in an MPLS backbone. 
    
   This document focuses on the LDP approach for setting up P2MP LSPs. 
   It lists a detailed set of requirements for P2MP extensions to LDP,  
   so as to deliver P2MP traffic over a LDP-enabled MPLS infrastructure.  
   These requirements should be used as guidelines when specifying LDP  
   extensions. It is intended that solutions that specify LDP procedures  
   for P2MP LSP setup, satisfy these requirements.  
    
   Note that generic requirements for P2MP extensions to MPLS are out of 
   the scope of this document. Rather this document describes solution 
   specific requirements related to LDP extensions in order to set up 
   P2MP LSPs. 
    
   Note also that other mechanisms could be used for setting up P2MP 
   LSPs, such as for instance PIM extensions, but these are out of the 
   scope of this document. The objective is not to compare these 
   mechanisms but rather to focus on the requirements for an LDP 
   extension approach. 
 
   The document is structured as follows: 
        - Section 4 points out the problem statement;  
        - Section 5 illustrates an application scenario;  
        - Section 6 addresses detailed requirements for P2MP LSPs;   
        - Section 7 finally discusses requirements for  
                    MultiPoint-to-MultiPoint (MP2MP) LSPs.

4. Problem Statement and Requirements Overview 
    
4.1. Problem Statement 
    
   LDP [RFC5036] has been deployed for setting up P2P and MP2P MPLS LSPs 
   as PE-to-PE tunnels so as to carry point-to-point traffic essentially 
   in Layer 3 and Layer 2 VPN networks. There are emerging requirements 
   for supporting multicast traffic delivery within these VPN 
   infrastructures ([RFC4834] and [L2VPN-MCAST-REQ]). For various 
   reasons, including consistency with P2P applications, and taking full 
   advantages of MPLS network infrastructure, it would be highly 
   desirable to use MPLS LSPs for the delivery of multicast traffic. 
   This could be implemented by setting up a group of P2P or MP2P LSPs, 
   but such an approach may be sub-optimal since it would result in data 
   replication at the ingress LSR, and bandwidth inefficiency (duplicate 
   data traffic within the network). Hence new mechanisms are required 
   that would allow traffic from an Ingress LSR to be efficiently 
   delivered to a number of Egress LSRs in an MPLS backbone, avoiding 
   duplicate copies of a packet on a given link.  
    
   Such efficient traffic delivery requires setting up P2MP LSPs. A P2MP 
   LSP is an LSP starting at an Ingress LSR, and ending on a set of one 
   or more Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by the Ingress LSR is replicated on 
   one or more Branch LSRs down to Egress LSRs. 
 
   RSVP-TE extensions for setting up P2MP TE LSPs, which meet 
   requirements expressed in [RFC4461], have been defined in [RFC4875]. 
   This approach is useful, in network environments where Traffic 
   Engineering capabilities are required. However, for operators that 
   deployed LDP for setting up PE-to-PE unicast MPLS LSPs, and without 
   the need for traffic engineering, an interesting approach would be 
   using LDP extensions for setting up P2MP LSPs.  
    
   The following gives a set of guidelines that a specification of LDP 
   extensions for setting up P2MP LSPs should follow.  
 
4.2. Requirements overview 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs, i.e. LSPs 
   with one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress LSRs, with traffic 
   replication at some Branch LSRs.  
    
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the addition or removal of leaves 
   associated with a P2MP LSP. 
     
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST co-exist with current LDP mechanisms and 
   inherit its capability sets from [RFC5036]. It is of paramount 
   importance that the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST NOT impede the operation 
   of existing P2P/MP2P LDP LSPs. Also the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST co-
   exist with P2P and P2MP RSVP-TE mechanisms [RFC3209], [RFC4875]. It

   is of paramount importance that the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST NOT 
   impede the operation of existing P2P and P2MP RSVP-TE LSPs. 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MAY also allow setting up multipoint-to-
   multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs connecting a group of Leaf LSRs acting 
   indifferently as Ingress LSR or Egress LSR. This may allow a 
   reduction in the amount of LDP state that needs to be maintained by a 
   LSR.  
   
5. Application scenario 
 
   Figure 1 below illustrates an LDP enabled MPLS provider network, used 
   to carry both unicast and multicast traffic of VPN customers 
   following for instance the architecture defined in [2547-MCAST] for 
   BGP/MPLS VPNs, or the one defined in [VPLS-MCAST]. 
    
   In this example, a set of MP2P LDP LSPs are setup between Provider 
   Edge (PE) routers to carry unicast VPN traffic within the MPLS 
   backbone. 
    
   And in this example a set of P2MP LDP LSPs are setup between PE 
   routers acting as Ingress LSRs and PE routers acting as Egress LSRs, 
   so as to support multicast VPN traffic delivery within the MPLS 
   backbone. 
    
   For instance, a P2MP LDP LSP is setup between Ingress LSR PE1 and 
   Egress LSRs PE2, PE3, and PE4. It is used to transport multicast 
   traffic from PE1 to PE2, PE3 and PE4. P1 is a Branch LSR, it 
   replicates MPLS traffic sent by PE1 to P2, P3 and PE2. P2 and P3 are 
   non-branch transit LSRs, they forward MPLS traffic sent by P1 to PE3 
   and PE4 respectively.

   If later there are new receivers attached to PE5 and PE6, then PE5 
   and PE6 join the P2MP LDP LSP. P2 and P3 become Branch LSRs and 
   replicate traffic received from P1, to PE3 and PE5, and to PE4 and 
   PE6 respectively (see figure 2 below).

   The above example is provided for the sake of illustration. 
   Note that P2MP LSPs ingress and egress LSRs may not necessarily be PE 
   routers. Also branch LSRs may not necessarily be P routers. 
 
6. Detailed Requirements 
 
6.1. P2MP LSPs 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs.  
   Data plane aspects related to P2MP LSPs are those already defined in  
   [RFC4461]. That is, a P2MP LSP has one Ingress LSR and one or  
   more Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by the Ingress LSR is received by all  
   Egress LSRs. The specific aspects related to P2MP LSPs is the action  
   required at a Branch LSR, where data replication occurs.  
   Incoming labelled data is appropriately replicated to several  
   outgoing interfaces which may use different labels. Only one copy of  
   a packet MUST be sent on a given link of a P2MP LSP.  
 
   A P2MP LSP MUST be identified by a constant and unique identifier    
   within the whole LDP domain, whatever the number of leaves, which   
   may vary dynamically. This identifier will be used so as to  
   add/remove leaves to/from the P2MP tree.  
      
6.2. P2MP LSP FEC 
    
   As with P2P MPLS technology [RFC5036], traffic MUST be classified 
   into a FEC in this P2MP extension. All packets which belong to a 
   particular P2MP FEC and which travel from a particular node MUST use 
   the same P2MP LSP.  
     
   As such, a new LDP FEC that is suitable for P2MP forwarding MUST be 
   specified.

6.3. P2MP LDP routing 
    
   As with P2P and MP2P LDP LSPs, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support 
   hop-by-hop LSP routing. P2MP LDP-based routing SHOULD rely upon the 
   information maintained in LSR Routing Information Bases (RIB). 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that the P2MP LSP routing rely upon a shortest path 
   to the Ingress LSR so as to setup an MPLS shortest path tree.  
 
6.4. Setting up, tearing down and modifying P2MP LSPs 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment, maintenance 
   and teardown of P2MP LSPs in a scalable manner. This MUST include 
   both the existence of a large amount of P2MP LSPs within a single 
   network and a large amount of leaf LSRs for a single P2MP LSP (see 
   also section 5.17 for scalability considerations and figures). 
    
   In order to scale well with a large number of leaves it is 
   RECOMMENDED to follow a leaf-initiated P2MP LSP setup approach. For 
   that purpose, leaves will have to be aware of the P2MP LSP 
   identifier. The ways a Leaf LSR discovers P2MP LSPs identifiers rely 
   on the applications that will use P2MP LSPs, and are out of the scope 
   of this document. 
    
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the dynamic addition and removal of 
   leaves to and from a P2MP LSP, without any restriction (provided 
   there is network connectivity). It is RECOMMENDED that these 
   operations be leaf-initiated.  
   These operations MUST not impact the data transfer (packet loss, 
   duplication, delay) towards other leaves. It is RECOMMENDED that 
   these operations do not cause any additional processing except on the 
   path from the added/removed Leaf LSR to the Branch LSR. 
 
6.5. Label Advertisement 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support downstream unsolicited label 
   advertisement mode. This is well suited to a leaf-initiated approach 
   and is consistent with P2P/MP2P LDP operations. 
    
   Other advertisement modes MAY also be supported. 
 
6.6. Data Duplication 
 
   Data duplication refers to the receipt of multiple copies of a packet 
   by any leaf. Although this may be a marginal situation, it may also 
   be detrimental for certain applications. Hence, data duplication 
   SHOULD as much as possible be avoided, and limited to (hopefully 
   rare) transitory conditions.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-03.txt     November 2007 


   Note, in particular, that data duplication might occur if P2MP LSP 
   rerouting is being performed (See also section 6.8). 
 
6.7. Detecting and Avoiding Loops 
 
   The P2MP LDP extension MUST have a mechanism to detect routing loops.  
   This may rely on extensions to the LDP Loop detection mechanism  
   defined in [RFC5036]. A loop detection mechanism may require  
   recording the set of LSRs traversed on the P2MP Tree. The P2MP loop  
   avoidance mechanism MUST not impact the scalability of the P2MP LDP  
   solution. 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD have a mechanism to avoid routing loops 
   in the data plane even during transient events.  
    
   Furthermore, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST avoid routing loops in the 
   data plane, that may trigger unexpected non-localized exponential 
   growth of traffic.  
 
6.8. P2MP LSP Re-routing 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the rerouting of a P2MP LSP in 
   the following cases: 
        - Network failure (link or node); 
        - A better path exists (e.g. new link, metric change); 
        - Planned maintenance. 
    
   Given that P2MP LDP routing should rely on the RIB, the achievement 
   of the following requirements also implies the underlying routing 
   protocols (IGP, etc.). 
    
6.8.1. Rerouting upon Network Failure 
    
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow for rerouting of a P2MP LSP in case 
   of link or node failure(s), by relying upon update of the routes in 
   the RIB. The rerouting time SHOULD be minimized as much as possible 
   so as to reduce traffic disruption.  
    
   A mechanism MUST be defined to prevent constant P2MP LSP teardown and 
   rebuild which may be caused by the instability of a specific 
   link/node in the network. This will rely on IGP dampening but may be 
   completed by specific dampening at the LDP level. 
 
6.8.2. Rerouting on a Better Path 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow for rerouting of a P2MP LSP in case 
   a better path is created in the network, for instance as a result of 
   a metric change, a link repair, or the addition of links or nodes. 
   This will rely on update of the routes in the RIB.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-03.txt     November 2007 


6.8.3. Rerouting upon Planned Maintenance 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support planned maintenance operations. 
   It MUST be possible to reroute a P2MP LSP before a link/node is 
   deactivated for maintenance purposes.  
   Traffic disruption and data duplication SHOULD be minimized as much 
   as possible during such planned maintenance.  
   P2MP LSP rerouting upon planned maintenance MAY rely on a make before 
   break procedure. 
 
6.9. Support for LAN interfaces 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD provide a way for a Branch LSR to send 
   a single copy of the data onto an Ethernet LAN interface and reach 
   multiple adjacent downstream nodes. This requires that the same label 
   be negotiated with all downstream LSRs for the LSP. 
    
   When there are several candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface, 
   the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD provide a way for all downstream LSRs 
   of a given P2MP LSP to select the same upstream LSR, so as to avoid 
   traffic replication. In addition, the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD allow 
   for an efficient balancing of a set of P2MP LSPs among a set of 
   candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface. 
 
6.10. Support for encapsulation in P2P and P2MP TE tunnels 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support nesting P2MP LSPs into P2P and 
   P2MP TE tunnels.  
    
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST provide a way for a Branch LSR of a P2MP 
   LSP, which is also a Head End LSR of a P2MP TE tunnel, to send a 
   single copy of the data onto the tunnel and reach all downstream LSRs 
   on the P2MP LSP, which are also Egress LSRs of the tunnel. As with 
   LAN interfaces, this requires that the same label be negotiated with 
   all downstream LSRs of the P2MP LDP LSP.  
 
6.11. Label spaces 
 
   Labels for P2MP LSPs and P2P/MP2P LSPs MAY be assigned from shared or 
   dedicated label spaces.  
    
   Note that dedicated label spaces will require the establishment of 
   separate P2P and P2MP LDP sessions. 
    
6.12. IPv4/IPv6 support 
 
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment of LDP sessions 
   over both IPv4 and IPv6 control planes.

6.13. Multi-Area/AS LSPs 
    
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment of multi-area 
   P2MP LSPs, i.e. LSPs whose leaves do not all reside in the same IGP 
   area as the Ingress LSR. This SHOULD be possible without requiring 
   the advertisement of Ingress LSRs' addresses across IGP areas. 
    
   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST also support the establishment of inter-
   AS P2MP LSPs, i.e. LSPs whose leaves do not all reside in the same AS 
   as the Ingress LSR. This SHOULD be possible without requiring the 
   advertisement of Ingress LSRs' addresses across ASes. 
 
6.14. OAM 
 
   LDP management tools ([RFC3815], etc.) will have to be enhanced to 
   support P2MP LDP extensions. This may yield a new MIB module, which 
   may possibly be inherited from the LDP MIB. 
    
   Built-in diagnostic tools MUST be defined to check the connectivity, 
   trace the path and ensure fast detection of data plane failures on 
   P2MP LDP LSPs. 
 
   Further and precise requirements and mechanisms for P2MP MPLS OAM 
   purpose are out of the scope of this document and are addressed in 
   [RFC4687]. 
    
6.15. Graceful Restart and Fault Recovery 
 
   LDP Graceful Restart mechanisms [RFC3478] and Fault Recovery  
   mechanisms [RFC3479] SHOULD be enhanced to support P2MP LDP LSPs. 
    
6.16. Robustness 
 
   A solution MUST avoid single points of failures provided there is 
   enough network connectivity.  
 
6.17. Scalability 
    
   Scalability is a key requirement for the P2MP LDP mechanism.  
   It MUST be designed to scale well with an increase in the number of 
   any of the following: 
      - number of Leaf LSRs per P2MP LSP; 
      - number of Downstream LSRs per Branch LSR; 
      - number of P2MP LSPs per LSR. 
 
   In order to scale well with an increase in the number of leaves, it 
   is RECOMMENDED that the size of a P2MP LSP state on a LSR, for one 
   particular LSP, depend only on the number of adjacent LSRs on the 
   LSP.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-03.txt     November 2007 


6.17.1. Orders of magnitude expected in operational networks 
    
   Typical orders of magnitude that we expect should be supported are: 
   - tens of thousands of P2MP trees spread out across core network 
      routers; 
   - hundreds, or a few thousands, of leaves per tree; 
    
   See also section 4.2 of [RFC4834]. 
    
6.18. Backward Compatibility 
    
   In order to allow for a smooth migration, the P2MP LDP mechanism 
   SHOULD offer as much backward compatibility as possible. In 
   particular, the solution SHOULD allow the setup of a P2MP LSP along 
   non-Branch Transit LSRs that do not support P2MP LDP extensions. 
 
   Also, the P2MP LDP solution MUST co-exist with current LDP mechanisms 
   and inherit its capability sets from [RFC5036]. The P2MP LDP solution 
   MUST not impede the operation of P2P/MP2P LSPs. A P2MP LDP solution 
   MUST be designed in such a way that it allows P2P/MP2P and P2MP LSPs 
   to be signalled on the same interface. 
 
7. Shared Trees 
    
   For traffic delivery between a group of N Leaf LSRs which are acting  
   indifferently as Ingress or Egress LSRs, it may be useful to  
   setup a shared tree connecting all these LSRs, instead of having N 
   P2MP LSPs. This would reduce the amount of control and forwarding 
   state that has to be maintained on a given LSR.  
    
   There are actually two main options for supporting such shared trees: 
    
        - This could rely on the applications protocols that use LDP  
          LSPs. A shared tree could consist of the combination of a  
          MP2P LDP LSP from Leafs LSRs to a given root node, with a P2MP  
          LSP from this root to Leaf LSRs. For instance with 
          Multicast L3 VPN applications, it would be possible to build a  
          shared tree by combining (see [2547-MCAST]): 
              - a MP2P unicast LDP LSP, from each PE of the group to a  
                particular root PE acting as tree root, 
              - with a P2MP LDP LSP from this root PE to each PE of the   
                group.  
    
        - Or this could rely on a specific LDP mechanism allowing to     
          setup multipoint-to-multipoint MPLS LSPs (MP2MP LSPs). 
    
   The former approach (Combination of MP2P and P2MP LSPs at the 
   application level) is out of the scope of this document while the 
   latter (MP2MP LSPs) belong to the scope of this document. 
   Requirements for the set up of MP2MP LSPs are listed below.

7.1. Requirements for MP2MP LSPs 
    
   A MP2MP LSP is a LSP connecting a group of Leaf LSRs acting 
   indifferently as Ingress or Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by any Leaf LSR 
   is received by all other Leaf LSRs of the group. 
    
   Procedures for setting up MP2MP LSPs with LDP SHOULD be specified.    
   An implementation that support P2MP LDP LSPs MAY also support MP2MP 
   LDP LSP. 
 
   The MP2MP LDP procedures MUST not impede the operations of P2MP LSP. 
 
   Requirements for P2MP LSPs, set forth in section 6, apply equally to 
   MP2MP LSPs. Particular attention should be given on the below 
   requirements: 
    
   - The solution MUST support recovery upon link and transit node  
     failure and there MUST NOT be any single point of failure (provided   
     network connectivity is redundant);  
   - The size of MP2MP state on a LSR, for one particular MP2MP LSP,  
     SHOULD only depend on the number of adjacent LSRs on the LSP; 
   - Furthermore, the MP2MP LDP mechanism MUST avoid routing loops that    
     may trigger exponential growth of traffic. Note that this  
     requirement is more challenging with MP2MP LSPs as a LSR can  
     receive traffic for a given LSP on multiple interfaces. 
 
    There are additional requirements specific to MP2MP LSPs: 
    
   - It is RECOMMENDED that a MP2MP MPLS LSP follow shortest paths to a  
     specific LSR called root LSR; 
   - It is RECOMMENDED to define several root LSRs (e.g. a primary and 
      a backup) to ensure redundancy upon root LSR failure; 
   - The receiver SHOULD not receive back a packet it has sent on the  
     MP2MP LSP; 
   - The solution SHOULD avoid that all traffic between any pair of  
     leaves is traversing a root LSR, and SHOULD as much as possible  
     minimize the distance between two leaves (similarly to PIM-Bidir   
     trees); 
   - It MUST be possible to check connectivity of a MP2MP LSP in both    
      directions. 
 
8. Evaluation criteria 
 
8.1. Performances 
 
      The solution will be evaluated with respect to the following 
      criteria: 
    
      (1) Time to add or remove a Leaf LSR; 
      (2) Time to repair a P2MP LSP in case of link or node  
          failure; 
      (3) Scalability (state size, number of messages, message size).

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-03.txt     November 2007 


 
   Particularly the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD be designed with as key 
   objective to minimize the additional amount of state and additional 
   processing required in the network. 
 
   Also, the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD be designed so that convergence 
   times in case of link or node failure are minimized, in order to 
   limit traffic disruption.  
 
8.2. Complexity and Risks 
    
   The proposed solution SHOULD not introduce complexity to the current 
   LDP operations to such a degree that it would affect the stability 
   and diminish the benefits of deploying such solution. 
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce any new security issue beyond those 
   inherent to LDP, and a P2MP LDP solution will rely on the security 
   mechanisms defined in [RFC5036] (e.g. TCP MD5 Signature). 
    
   An evaluation of the security features for MPLS networks may be found 
   in [MPLS-SEC], and where issues or further work is identified by that 
   document, new security features or procedures for the MPLS protocols 
   will need to be developed. 
 
10. IANA Considerations 
 
      This informational document makes no requests to IANA for action.
