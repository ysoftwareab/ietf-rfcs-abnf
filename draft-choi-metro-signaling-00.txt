Abstract 
    
   This draft mentions the bandwidth reservation in Metro Network. At 
   first, this lists the issues that should be generally checked for 
   bandwidth reservation, and is intended to point out RSVP-TE for Metro 
   Network. Moreover, this focuses on consideration issues to understand 
   whether the existing RSVP-TE supports the demands for bandwidth 
   reservation in Metro Network.

1. Introduction 
    
   Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) have emerged as a key network build-
   out point. In recent years, the bandwidth in Local Area Networks 
   (LAN) has increased rapidly, driven by the widespread adoption of 
   Gigabit Ethernet, while bandwidth capacity in Wide Area Networks 
   (WAN) have exploded. As a result, the new bottleneck is in the MAN, 
   the traffic intersection of the LAN and WAN, i.e. the data traffic 
   explosion is increasing at unprecedented rates throughout the world, 
   nowhere more so than in the MAN. The advent of high-speed LANs, 
   broadband consumer access, Application Service Providers, inexpensive 
   video conferencing, Voice over IP, and other high bandwidth 
   applications and services has put tremendous pressure on metro 
   network infrastructures. Therefore the bandwidth in the MAN will have 
   to be provided in order to control network-based connection. 
   The section for bandwidth reservation can be edge-to-edge or end-to-
   end. But we assume that the edge-to-edge bandwidth reservation method 
   can be chosen for the MAN, which is explained in the Figure 1.

2. Terminology 
    
   Agent: any entity that takes part in QoS signaling. 
    
   Domain: a collection of networks under the same administrative 
   control and grouped for administrative purposes. 
    
   End-to-End QoS: the QoS delivered by the network between two 
   communicating end hosts. End-to-End QoS co-ordinates and enforces 
   predefined traffic management policies across multiple network 
   entities and administrative domains. 
    
   Edge-to-Edge QoS: QoS within an administrative domain that connects 
   to other networks rather than hosts or end systems. 
    
   Flow: a traffic stream (sequence of IP packets between two end 
   systems) for a specific level of QoS is to be provided. The flow can 
   be unicast or multicast. 
    
   Path: the route across the networks taken by a flow or aggregate, i.e. 
   which domains/subdomains it passes through and the egress/ingress 
   points for each. 
    
   Path segment: the segment of a path within a single domain/subdomain.

   QoS Controller: this is responsible for interpreting the signaling 
   carrying the user QoS parameters, optionally inserting/modifying the 
   parameters according to local network QoS management policy, and 
   invoking local QoS provisioning mechanisms. 
    
   QoS initiator: this is responsible for generating the QSCs for 
   traffic flow(s) based on user or application requirements and 
   signaling them to the network as well as invoking local QoS 
   provisioning mechanisms. This can be located in the end system, but 
   may reside elsewhere in network. 
    
   QoS Service Classes (QSC): specify the QoS requirement of a traffic 
   flow or aggregate. 
    
   QoS Signaling: a way to communicate QSCs and QoS management 
   information between hosts, end systems and network devices etc. May 
   include request and response messages to facilitate 
   negotiation/renegotiation, asynchronous feedback messages to inform 
   End Hosts, QoS initiators and QoS controllers about current QoS 
   levels, and QoS querying facilities. 
    
    
3. Issues for Bandwidth Reservation 
 
   This section lists the issues that should be generally checked for 
   bandwidth reservation. 
    
3.1 Path Establishment 
    
   Before the signaling protocol supports the actual communication of 
   QoS requirement information for traffic flows, the path from a source 
   to a destination should be established. In order to support this, 
   some actions must be carried out. 
    
   - Peer Agent Discovery: The Agents should be able to discover peer 
   Agents, and optionally establish a trust relationship with them.  One 
   Agent may discover one or more peer Agents in a number of different 
   domains. Routing protocol and address resolution protocol are the 
   typical methods for this. 
    
   - Agent Selection: Each Agent selects the next hop Agent from the 
   peers with which it has established a relationship during peer agent 
   discovery. 
        
    
3.2 Signaling Parameters 
 
   The capabilities and the resource availabilities of the nodes along 
   the data path are determined. Therefore the actual request for

            Consideration of RSVP-TE Extension for Metro Network 
 
 
   resources that triggers the QoS provisioning must be passed through 
   the nodes with QoS parameters. End-to-end different parameters may 
   have relevance in different parts of the network. 
    
   - Session ID to identify the traffic flow  
    
   - Reservation ID to identify the reservation independently from the 
   flow identifier  
    
   - Initiator ID to identify the requestor of the reservation.

3.3 Granularity of bandwidth 
    
   Aggregation of per-flow signaling is a technique contributing to 
   scalability of bandwidth reservation. However depending on the 
   network environments, such as Access Network, Metro Network and 
   Backbone Network, diverse granularity of bandwidth should be able to 
   be provisioned. For example, in the case of bandwidth insufficiency 
   or small data traffic in network, bandwidth should be provided as 
   much as needed. 
    
3.4 Resilience 
    
   If QoS control components are located within the data path, when a 
   node fails or the data path changes due to re-routing both the 
   signaling and data paths are affected. Resilience can be achieved by 
   redirection around the point of failure. However, any state 
   information maintained by the failed node must be transferred to 
   another node, or re-discovered. If the QoS enabled path, including 
   the state information can be re-established in a considerably short 
   time an application would experience service degradation only for a 
   short time period.

3.5 Transparency for path traversal 
    
   It should be possible for signaling to traverse path segments 
   transparently, i.e. without interpretation by some QoS controllers. 
   This ability can be useful when a local QoS provisioning protocol is 
   employed in a subdomain. There is no need for signaling to be 
   interpreted in this region. It is also useful for tunneling QoS 
   signaling. 
   When the signaling enters the transparent region, the adjacent 
   controller would choose the next QoS controller beyond the 
   transparent region as a next-hop QoS controller. 
    
4. Consideration issues in Metro Network 
    
   This draft suggests RSVP-TE, Extension to RSVP, in order to support 
   bandwidth reservation in Metro Network, and this section mentions 
   some consideration issues to adopt RSVP-TE as bandwidth reservation 
   protocol in Metro Network. 
    
4.1 Assumption 
    
   The Agents in Metro Network consist of Metro Switches, which use 
   RSVP-TE as bandwidth reservation protocol. 
    
4.2 Path Establishment 
    
   A source uses Address Resolution Protocol in order to establish a 
   path from itself to a destination within the same pure Metro Switch 
   Network. However if a destination does not exist within the same pure 
   Metro Switch Network, a source uses Routing Protocol to discover a 
   corresponding peer.  
    
4.3 Granularity 
    
   Metro Network should be able to support per-flow signaling in order 
   to use bandwidth efficiently. RSVP-TE uses label switching to realize 
   this.

4.4 Resilience 
    
   Backup Label Switched Paths can be configured for fast fail-over, 
   improving overall service reliability. Backup LSPs can be defined as 
   hot-standby LSPs that have been pre-established, or can be 
   dynamically created upon failure of the primary LSP. 
   Another alternative is to enable the fast-reroute option when an LSP 
   is established, leading to the creation of detour LSPs around each 
   point of failure in the path 
    
4.5 Transparency 
    
   By adding the explicit route object (ERO) to the Path message, the 
   Agent can specify a predetermined explicit route for the Label 
   Switched Path, independent of IP routing. Therefore an explicit route 
   is a specification of groups of agents to be traversed and a set of 
   operations to be performed along the path, i.e. tunnel. 
    
5. Conclusion 
    
   This draft suggests RSVP-TE as signaling protocol for Metro Network. 
   It is because the size of Metro Network becomes bigger and it could 
   be possible for this area to be congestion point, but there is 
   currently no bandwidth reservation method. Therefore this area 
   necessarily requires bandwidth reservation protocol and fast 
   switching method. To solve the problem, there are some consideration 
   issues adopting RSVP-TE in Metro Network. However RSVP-TE will be 
   able to satisfy bandwidth requirement, for it is based on MPLS that 
   is capable of supporting fast forwarding process and traffic 
   engineering.
