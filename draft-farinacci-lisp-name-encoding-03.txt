1.  Introduction

   The LISP architecture and protocols [RFC6830] introduces two new
   numbering spaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators
   (RLOCs) which are intended to replace most use of IP addresses on the
   Internet.  To provide flexibility for current and future
   applications, these values can be encoded in LISP control messages
   using a general syntax that includes Address Family Identifier (AFI)
   [RFC1700].

   The length of the value field is implicit in the type of address that
   follows.  For AFI 17, a Distinguished Name can be encoded.  A name
   can be a variable length field so the length cannot be determined
   solely from the AFI value 17.  This draft defines a termination
   character, an 8-bit value of 0 to be used as a string terminator so
   the length can be determined.

   LISP Distinguished Names are useful when encoded either in EID-
   records or RLOC-records in LISP control messages.  As EIDs, they can
   be registered in the mapping system to find resources, services, or
   simply used as a self-documenting feature that accompany other
   address specific EIDs.  As RLOCs, Distinguished Names, along with
   RLOC specific addresses and parameters, can be used as labels to
   identify equipment type, location, or any self-documenting string a
   registering device desires to convey.

2.  Definition of Terms

   Address Family Identifier (AFI):  a term used to describe an address
      encoding in a packet.  An address family currently defined for
      IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  See [AFI] and [RFC1700] for details on
      other types of information that can be AFI encoded.

3.  Distinguished Name Format

   An AFI=17 Distinguished Name is encoded as:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |            AFI = 17           |       ASCII String ...        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |               ...  ASCII String             |       0         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The string of characters are encoded in the ASCII character-set
   definition [RFC0020].

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The code-point values in this specification are already allocated in
   [AFI].
