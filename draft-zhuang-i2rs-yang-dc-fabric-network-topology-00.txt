1.  Introduction

   Currently, a data center network is composed of single or multiple
   fabrics which are also known as PODs (a Point Of Delivery), which may
   be heterogeneous due to implementation of different technologies
   within these fabrics.  For example, within a DC network, Fabric A may
   use VXLAN while Fabric B may use VLAN.  The management of the entire
   heterogeneous network will be sophisticated and complex especially
   when the DC network scales.

   However, in this heterogeneous DC network, fabric can be considered
   to be an atomic structure to provide network management and services,
   as well as capacity scaling.  From this point, the management of the
   entire DC network can be broken down into management of these fabrics
   as to provide easier management and flexibility and scalability.

   With this purpose, this document defines a YANG data model for the
   Fabric topology of Data Center Networks by using YANG [6020][ I-
   D.draft-ietf-netmod-rfc6020bis-09].  To do so, it augments the
   generic network and network topology data models defined in [I-
   D.ietf-i2rs-yang -network-topo] with information specific to a DC
   fabric.

   This model defines the generic configuration and operational state
   for the DC fabric common to all vendor implementation, which can be
   extended by vendors with specific information.  This model can be
   used by the network elements to expose to a network controller and
   capture their understanding of the overall network topology.  Also,
   it can be used by a network controller to represent its view of the
   fabric topology that it controls and expose it to applications for
   network management for Data-center networks.

   Moreover, in the context of topology architecture defined in
   [I-D.ietf -i2rs-yang-network-topo] and [I.D. draft-ietf-i2rs-usecase-
   reqs-summary], this model can act as a service topology in
   conjunction with the existing I2RS topologies.  As a service
   topology, this DC fabric topology can be further connected with
   network elements in the underlay topologies, such as L3 topology
   defined in [I.D. draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology-01].  By using the
   DC fabric topology, people can describe characteristics of a DC
   fabric (such as encapsulation, spine/leaf node, and gateway type,
   etc.).  Also, clients can consume the topology information at fabric
   level, while no need to parse entire set of links and nodes in
   underlay networks.

2.  Definitions an Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   DC Fabric: also known as POD, is a module of network, compute,
   storage, and application components that work together to deliver
   networking services.  It is a repeatable design pattern, and its
   components maximize the modularity, scalability, and manageability of
   data centers.

2.2.  Tree diagram

   The following notations are used within the data tree and carry the
   meaning as below.

  Each node is printed as:
    <status> <flags> <name> <opts> <type>

    <status> is one of:
         +  for current
         x  for deprecated
         o  for obsolete
    <flags> is one of:
        rw for configuration data
        ro for non-configuration data
        -x for rpcs
        -n for notifications
    <name> is the name of the node

    If the node is augmented into the tree from another module, its name
    is printed as <prefix>:<name>.
    <opts> is one of:
         ?  for an optional leaf or choice
         !  for a presence container
         *  for a leaf-list or list
         [<keys>] for a list's keys
    <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3.  Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the DC Fabric topology model and
   its relationship with other topology models.

3.1.  Model structure

   The relationship of the DC fabric topology model and other topology
   models is shown in the following figure (dotted lines in the figure
   denote augmentations).

   From the perspective of resource management and service provisioning,
   the fabric topology model augments the basic network topology model
   with definitions and features specific to a DC fabric, to provide
   common configuration and operations for heterogeneous fabrics.

3.2.  Fabric Topology

   The fabric topology model is designed to be generic and can be
   applied to data center fabrics built with different technologies,
   such as VLAN, VXLAN etc al.

   The structure of "ietf-fabric-topology" data model is depicted in the
   following diagram.

   The fabric-topology augments the generic ietf-network and ietf-
   network-topology modules as follows:

   o  A new topology type "ietf-fabric-topology" is introduced and added
      under the "network-types" container of the ietf-network module.

   o  Additional topology attributes are introduced, defined in a
      grouping, which augments the "network" list of the network module.

      The attributes include a Fabric name, fabric-id, type of the
      underlay network, descriptions of the fabric as well as a set of
      options defined in a container.  The options container includes
      leaves of the gateway-mode (centralized or distributed) and
      traffic-behavior (whether acl needed for the traffic).

   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by augmenting the
      "node" list of the network module.  New objects include node id of
      a node in the topology and its role, such as "SPINE" node or
      "LEAF" node, which should work together with gateway-mode.

   o  Termination points (in network topology module) are augmented with
      logical port attributes defined in a container.  It contains
      common information of name, id, role of the port (such as port
      connected to endpoint, or port connected to intra-fabric
      communication, etc al).  Besides, it also carries layering
      information for a port with containers of layer 1, 2 and 3
      information.  A set of acl for the fabric is also defined.  At
      last, it provides a set of underlay ports that the logical fabric
      port can be mapped to.

   In addition, we also define several rpc operations for fabric
   managements within data center networks to get and configure fabrics
   and obtain a response.  The YANG module defines 7 rpc commands for
   this management, including getting all fabric information, composing
   a fabric, decomposing a fabric, adding a node to a fabric, removing a
   node from a fabric, adding a link to a fabric and removing a link
   from a fabric.
