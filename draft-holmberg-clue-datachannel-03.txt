1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how to use the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP) on top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) protocol (SCTPoDTLS) for transporting CLUE protocol messages
   between CLUE entities.

   The document describes the SCTP considerations for CLUE, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating a SCTPoDTLS connection for
   CLUE.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol are outside
   the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          February 2014


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   CLUE data channel refers to the SCTPoDTLS association that is used
   between two CLUE entities in order to transport CLUE messages.

   CLUE message refers to a CLUE protocol message that is sent over the
   CLUE data channel.

   CLUE entity refers to a SIP User Agent (UA) device that supports the
   CLUE mechanism (including the CLUE protocol).

   [RFC4960] defines a SCTP stream as a unidirectional logical channel
   established from one to another associated SCTP endpoint, within
   which all user messages are delivered in sequence except for those
   submitted to the unordered delivery service.

   [RFC4960] defines a SCTP identifier as a unsigned integer, which
   identifies an SCTP stream.

3.  Usage of SCTPoDTLS in the CLUE Context

3.1.  General

   This section defines the CLUE data channel, and describes the SCTP
   features and extensions used to realize it.

   The CLUE data channel realization, and set of SCTP features, are
   based on the the RTCWEB data channel defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].  This will allow CLUE entities to be
   interoperable with entities implementing
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

3.2.  CLUE Data Channel Definition

   The CLUE data channel is realized by using the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on top of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].

   The realization of a bidirectional CLUE Data Channel is a pair of one
   incoming SCTP stream and one outgoing SCTP stream.  These streams are
   then used to transport CLUE messages in both directions.

   The SCTP streams MUST belong to the same SCTP association.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Protocol Data Channel          February 2014


   Within a given CLUE session, CLUE entities MUST use a single CLUE
   data channel for all CLUE messages associated with the CLUE session.

   The SCTP streams MUST have identical SCTP stream identifier values,
   unless a specific value is already used for some other purpose.

   OPEN ISSUE #1: The requirement to use identical STCP stream
   identifier values might be modified depending on what mechanism will
   be used to negotiate the identifier values.

3.3.  RTCWEB Data Channel Protocol Usage

   OPEN ISSUE #2: It is FFS whether the RTCWEB Data Channel Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] will be used with the CLUE data
   channel.

   NOTE: If [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] will be used with the CLUE
   data channel, a new associated 'protocol' value needs to be
   registered with IANA in the 'Protocol Registry' defined by
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].

3.4.  SCTP Considerations

3.4.1.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)

   CLUE entities MUST use the PPID value 51 when sending CLUE messages,
   according to the procedures in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   NOTE: As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the PPID value
   51 indicates that the SCTP message contains data encoded in a UTF-8
   format.  The PPID value 51 does not indicate what protocol the SCTP
   message contains.

   NOTE: If the RTCWEB Data Channel Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol]  will be used for the CLUE data
   channel, the PPID value 50 will be used for Data Channel Protocol
   messages.

3.4.2.  Reliability

   The usage of SCTP for the data channel ensures reliable transport of
   CLUE messages.

   NOTE: [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] requires the support of the
   partial reliability extension defined in [RFC3758].  This is not
   needed for CLUE, as messages are required to always be sent reliably.
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] also mandates support of the limited
   retransmission policy defined in [I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies].

3.4.3.  Order

   CLUE entities MUST use the ordered delivery SCTP service, as
   described in section 6.6 of [RFC2960].

3.4.4.  Stream Reset

   CLUE entities MUST support the stream reset extension defined in
   [RFC6525]

   The dynamic address reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC5061]
   MUST be used to signal the support of the stream reset extension
   defined in [RFC6525].  Other features of [RFC5061] MUST NOT be used.

3.4.5.  Interleaving

   CLUE entities MUST support the message interleaving mechanism defined
   in [I-D.stewart-tsvwg-sctp-ndata].

3.4.6.  SCTP Multihoming

   CLUE entities MUST NOT use SCTP multihoming.

   NOTE: The SCTPoDTLS mechanism does not support SCTP multihoming.

4.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

4.1.  SDP-based WebRTC Data Channel Negotiation Usage

   OPEN ISSUE #3: It is FFS whether the SDP-based WebRTC Data Channel
   Negotiation mechanism [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg]
   will be used with the CLUE data channel.

   NOTE: If [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg] will be used
   with the CLUE data channel, a new associated 'sub-protocol' value
   needs to be registered with IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC-XXXX with the RFC number of this
   document.]
