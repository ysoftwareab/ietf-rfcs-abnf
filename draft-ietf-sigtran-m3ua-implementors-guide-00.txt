 1. Introduction

    This document contains a compilation of all defects found up until
    March 2002 for the MTP3 User Adaptation Layer (M3UA) [RFCxxxx]. These
    defects may be of an editorial or technical nature. This document may
    be thought of as a companion document to be used in the
    implementation of M3UA to clarify errors in the original M3UA
    document. This document updates RFCxxxx and text within this
    document, where noted, supersedes the text found in RFCxxxx. Each
    error will be detailed within this document in the form of:

       - The problem description,
       - The text quoted from RFCxxxx,
       - The replacement text,
       - A description of the solution.


 2. Conventions

    The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
    they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
    [RFC2119].


 3. Corrections to RFC-M3UA

 3.1 Parameter Containing Subparameters with Padding Bytes

 3.1.1  Description of the problem

    If a parameter contains subparameters with padding bytes, should the
    parameter length include the subparameter padding bytes or not.

 3.1.2  Text changes to the document

    ---------
    Old text: (Section 3.2)
    ---------
    Parameter Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)

    The Parameter Length field contains the size of the parameter in
    bytes, including the Parameter Tag, Parameter Length, and Parameter
    Value fields. Thus, a parameter with a zero-length Parameter Value
    field would have a Length field of 4.  The Parameter Length does not
    include any padding bytes.

    the Parameter Length field will include all the bytes of each
    subparameter including subparameter padding bytes (if any).



 3.1.3 Solution description

    When calculating the length of a parameter that contains
    subparameters, include the padding bytes of the subparameters.


 3.2  Dynamic Registration Not Supported

 3.2.1 Description of the problem

    There is a need to be able to correlate a Dynamic Registration not
    supported error to a Registration Request.


 3.2.2 Text changes to the document

    ---------
    Old text: (Section 4.4.1)
    ---------

    If the SGP does not support the registration procedure, the SGP
    returns an Error message to the ASP, with an error code of
    "Unsupported Message Type".

    The "Unsupported Message Class" error is sent if a message with an
    unexpected or unsupported Message Class is received.  For this error,
    the Diagnostic Information parameter MUST be included with the first
    40 bytes of the offending message.

    The "Unsupported Message Type" error is sent if a message with an

 3.2.3 Solution description

    A SGP that does not support registration must return an Error
    (Unsupported Message Class) message with the first 40 bytes of the
    offending message (i.e. any Routing Key Management message sent by
    the ASP) so that the ASP can correlate this error to the Registration
    Request message.

    Note that the changes to the "Unsupported Message Class" and
    "Unsupported Message Type" text make this a general solution that
    allows the ASP or SG side to correlate these error responses with the
    offending message.



 3.3 Contents of User Protocol Data

 3.3.1 Description of the problem

    There is a need to add a reference that contains the different SS7
    message label types to ensure implementations take into account the
    differences among these labels.

    ---------
    Old text: (Section 3.3.1)

    Protocol Data: (variable)

         The Protocol Data field contains a byte string of MTP-User
         information from the original SS7 message starting with the
         first byte of the original SS7 message following the Routing
         Label.

 3.3.3 Solution description

    A proper reference to the different SS7 message label types was
    required.


 3.4 NIF Not Available on SGP

 3.4.1 Description of the problem

    The text is not clear about how the SGP/SG should handle the case of
    the NIF becoming unavailable on a SGP or all SGPs (SG).

 3.4.2 Text changes to the document

    ---------
    Old text: (None)

    ---------
    New text: (Section 4.7)
    ---------

    If the SG (all the SGPs) is isolated from the NIF, then all the users
    are isolated from the SS7 network.  A DUNA(*) message MUST be sent.

    If only one SGP in the SG is isolated entirely from the NIF, the SGP
    SHOULD abort its associations. An alternative would be for the SGP to
    send ASP Down Ack.










 Pastor, Morneault                                               [Page 7]

 INTERNET-DRAFT          M3UA IMPLEMENTOR∆S GUIDE          March 22, 2002


    If one or more SGP suffer a partial failure (where aborting the
    association(s) would cause all active AS(es) to fail), then the SGP
    MUST send ASP Inactive Acks for the affected AS(es).  This is the
    case where an SGP can continue to service one or more active AS(es),
    but due to a partial failure it is unable to service one or more
    active AS(es).

 3.4.3 Solution description

    The addition of this text specifies the SGP/SG behavoir for the
    different scenarios of the NIF becoming unavailable on the SGP/SG.


 3.5 Scope of Network Appearance

 3.5.1 Description of the problem

    A problem was found with the scope of the NA parameter. It was not
    clear whether it should be unique across SG-AS or unique across SCTP
    associations

 3.5.2 Text changes to the document

    ---------
    Old text: (Section 3.3.1)
    ---------
    Network Appearance: 32-bits (unsigned integer)

    The Network Appearance parameter identifies the SS7 network context
    for the message and implicitly identifies the SS7 Point Code format
    used, the SS7 Network Indicator value, and the MTP3 and possibly the
    MTP3-User protocol type/variant/version used within the specific SS7
    network.  Where an SG operates in the context of a single SS7
    network, or individual SCTP associations are dedicated to each SS7
    network context, the Network Appearance parameter is not required.
    In other cases the parameter may be configured to be present for the
    use of the receiver.

    The Network Appearance parameter value is of local significance only,
    coordinated between the SGP and ASP. Therefore, in the case where an
    ASP is connected to more than one SGP, the same SS7 network context
    may be identified by different Network Appearance values depending
    over which SGP a message is being transmitted/received.

    Where the optional Network Appearance parameter is present, it must
    be the first parameter in the message as it defines the format of the
    Protocol Data field.

    IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: For simplicity of configuration it may be
    desirable to use the same NA value across all nodes sharing a
    particular network context.

    format, the SS7 Network Indicator value, and the MTP3 and possibly
    the MTP3-User protocol type/variant/version used within the specific

    IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: For simplicity of configuration it may be
    desirable to use the same NA value across all nodes sharing a
    particular network context.

 3.5.3 Solution description

    The text is modified to show that NA has to be coordinated between AS
    to SG. This correction also aligns this text with the NA definition
    in section 1.2 of the RFC.


 3.6 Semi-optional RC parameter

 3.6.1 Description of the problem

    Some optional parameters are not always optional. The text should be
    clear when optional parameters are not optional.

    an MTP-TRANSFER primitive, including the complete MTP3 Routing Label.
    The DATA message contains the following variable length parameters:
         Network Appearance       Optional
         Routing Context          Optional
         Protocol Data            Mandatory

 3.6.3 Solution description

    Stating that the parameter is semi-optional, implies that it not
    either optional or mandatory. In the parameter description the text
    explains when it is mandatory and when optional.


 3.7 Receiving REG for a RK already registered

 3.7.1 Description of the problem

    If the SG determines that the received RK was already registered, the
    SGP returns a Registration Response message to the ASP, containing a
    Registration Result "Error - Cannot Support Unique Routing".



 3.7.3 Solution description

    By specifying the error code, the general problem of re-registering a
    RK is solved. This error response applies whether the Routing Key is
    Active or Inactive.



 3.8 OPC list in the Registration Request Message

    Request message. What is it valid for?

 3.9 Auditing procedure and congestion state

    destination, and the SS7 destination is congested, the SGP MUST
    additionally respond with an SCON message before the DAVA or DRST
    message.  If the SS7 destination is available and congested, the SGP
    MUST respond with an SCON message and then a DAVA message.  If the
    SS7 destination is restricted and congested, the SGP MUST respond
    with an SCON message immediately followed by a DRST message.  If the
    SGP has no information on the availability status of the SS7
    destination, the SGP responds with a DUNA message, as it has no
    routing information to allow it to route traffic to this destination.

    appropriate congestion level) and then a DAVA message.  If the SS7
    destination is restricted, the SGP MUST respond with an SCON message
    (with the appropriate congestion level) immediately followed by a
    DRST message.  If the SGP has no information on the availability
    status of the SS7 destination, the SGP responds with a DUNA message,
    as it has no routing information to allow it to route traffic to this
    destination.

    Where the SGP does not maintain the congestion status of the SS7
    destination (ITU international networks), the response to a DAUD
    message should always be only a DAVA, DRST or DUNA message as
    appropriate.

    5.5 M3UA/MTP3-User Boundary Examples



 3.9.3 Solution description

    Whenever a DAUD is received, it has to be responded with
    DAVA/DUNA/DRST message depending on the peer node's state. If the SGP
    has congestion control (i.e. no ITU international networks) an SCON
    message with the appropiate congestion level should precede to the
    DAVA/DRST messages upon a DAUD arrival.

    A new examples section has been added to show this behavior.


 3.10 Response to an ASPIA message

 3.10.1 Description of the problem

    It was not clear how to act in the following scenario:


           ASP                          SGP
           ---                          ---
            |  ------ ASPIA (RC1)----->  |

            |  <----  ASPIA Ack -------  |

            |  -----DEREG REQ (RC1)--->  |
            |  <----DEREG RSP (RC1)----  |
            |  -------ASPIA (RC1)----->  |


    What should SG do?

    action MAY be initiated at the ASP by an M-ASP_INACTIVE request
    primitive from Layer Management or MAY be initiated automatically by
    an M3UA management function.  In the case where an ASP is processing
    the traffic for more than one Application Server across a common SCTP
    association, the ASP Inactive message contains one or more Routing
    Contexts to indicate for which Application Servers the ASP Inactive
    message applies.

    When an ASP wishes to withdraw from receiving traffic within an AS,or
    the ASP wants to initiate the process of activation, the ASP sends an
    ASP Inactive message to the SGP or IPSP.

    An ASP Inactive message MUST be always responded by the peer
    (although other messages may be sent in the middle):
       - If the corresponding RK is registered (statically or
          dynamically), the peer should respond with an ASP Inactive Ack
          message.
       -           If the RK is not registered, or the RC information is not valid,
          the peer must respond with an ERROR message with Error Code =
          "Invalid Routing Context".
       - If the RC is missing and its specification is needed according
          to the used configuration, the peer must respond with an ERROR
          message with Error Code = "Missing Parameter".

    The action of sending the ASP Inactive message MAY be initiated at
    the ASP by an M-ASP_INACTIVE request primitive from Layer Management
    or MAY be initiated automatically by an M3UA management function.  In
    the case where an ASP is processing the traffic for more than one
    Application Server across a common SCTP association, the ASP Inactive
    message contains one or more Routing Contexts to indicate for which
    Application Servers the ASP Inactive message applies.

 3.10.3 Solution description

    A more detailed specification of the messages to be sent upon the
    reception of an ASPIA has been added to the Inactive Procedures
    Section.


 3.11 INFO and DIAG parameter length

 3.11.1 Description of the problem

    At the 2nd interop a question was raised about accepting length of 4
    bytes for DIAG and INFO parameters.

    INFO String: variable length

    The optional INFO String parameter can carry any meaningful UTF-8
    [10] character string along with the message. Length of the INFO
    String parameter is from 0 to 255 octets. No procedures are presently
    identified for its use but the INFO String MAY be used for debugging
    purposes.

    The optional INFO String parameter can carry any meaningful UTF-8

    String parameter is from 0 to 255 octets. This means that No
    procedures are presently identified for its use but the INFO String
    MAY be used for debugging purposes. An INFO String with a zero length
    parameter is not considered as an error (this means that the Length
    field in the TLV will be set to 4).

    Diagnostic Information: variable length

    When included, the optional Diagnostic information can be any
    information germane to the error condition, to assist in
    identification of the error condition. The Diagnostic information
    SHOULD contain the offending message.

    the Length field in the TLV will be set to 4).


 3.11.3 Solution description

    It has been explicitly included the fact that a parameter with legth
    zero is allowed.
