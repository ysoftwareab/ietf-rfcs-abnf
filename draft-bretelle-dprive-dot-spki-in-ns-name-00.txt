              draft-bretelle-dprive-dot-spki-in-ns-name-00

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism to exchange the Subject Public
   Key Info (SPKI) ([RFC5280] Section 4.1.2.7) fingerprint associated
   with a DNS-over-TLS (DoT [RFC7858]) authoritative server by encoding
   it as part of its name.  The fingerprint can thereafter be used to
   validate the certificate received from the DoT server as well as
   being able to discover support for DoT on the server.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism to exchange the Subject Public
   Key Info (SPKI) ([RFC5280] Section 4.1.2.7) fingerprint associated
   with a DNS-over-TLS (DoT [RFC7858]) authoritative server by encoding
   it as part of its name.  The fingerprint can thereafter be used to
   validate the certificate received from the DoT server as well as
   being able to discover support for DoT on the server.

2.  Terminology

   A server that supports DNS-over-TLS is called a "DoT server" to
   differentiate it from a "DNS Server" (one that provides DNS service
   over any other protocol), likewise, a client that supports this
   protocol is called a "DoT client"

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Validating a remote DoT server

   While DoT provides protection against eavesdropping and on-path
   tampering of the DNS queries exchanged with an authoritative server,
   a recursive server that is talking to a remote DoT server needs a
   mechanism to authenticate that the name server it is communicating
   with is indeed the one that the authority of the zone manages or has
   delegated responsibility to.

   A common mechanism is to have TLS certificates issued by
   "Certification Authorities" (CAs), those CA public keys are used as
   trust anchors, and through a chain of trust, a leaf TLS certificate
   can be validated.  Any CA is able to issue a certificate for any
   domain, which can have its drawbacks ([RFC6698] Section 1.1).

   Another method is to leverage DANE/TLSA ([RFC6698]), in which case a
   recursive resolver would be provided the certificate or SPKI hash
   over DNS and validate it using DNSSEC ([RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035]).

   This document describes a mechanism to signal to a recursive resolver
   that DoT is supported by the authoritative name server as well as
   providing a fingerprint of the SPKI to expect from the name server,
   this is done by formatting a special first label for the name
   servers.  Recursive servers that understand the naming convention
   detailed in this document will be able to upgrade their connection to
   the authoritative server to TLS, while the ones that don't will
   transparently use the name servers as a standard UDP/53 and TCP/53
   servers.  This format is heavily inspired from [dnscurve].

4.  Encoding data in a domain name label

   A label is limited to a maximum of 63 octets ([RFC1035]
   Section 2.3.4) and has a limited set of characters that can be used
   ([RFC1035] Section 2.3.1), limiting both the amount of data that can
   be embedded in a label as well as the encoding format.

   The set of character used by Base32 encoding ([RFC4648] Section 6),
   without padding character, is suitable to be used in a label.  Base32
   encodes a 5-bit group into 1 byte which allows to encode up to 39
   bytes within the 63 bytes space of a label.

   floor(63 * 5 / 8)

   While this limits what can be encoded in a label, there is enough
   space to store the hash produced by sha256 which requires 32 bytes,
   leaving 7 bytes to spare.

4.1.  Formatting DoT SPKI in name server name.

   The formatting of a name server is defined as follow:

   <label> ::= <dot-header> <b32-spki-fingerprint>
   <dot-header> ::= "dot-"
   <b32-spki-fingerprint> ::= base32encode(<spki-fingerprint>)
   <spki-fingerprint> ::= sha256(<spki>)
   <spki> ::= der-encoded binary structure of SubjectPublicKeyInfo

4.1.1.  Example

   For the zone example.com, having 2 name servers, one at IPv4
   192.0.2.1 and one at IPv6 2001:DB8::1, both of them providing DoT
   support and using certificate cert.pem, the "<b32-spki-fingerprint>"
   can be generated using the following command line:

   openssl x509 -in /path/to/cert.pem  -pubkey -noout | \
   openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | \
   openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | \
   base32 | tr -d '=' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
   tpwxmgqdaurcqxqsckxvdq5sty3opxlgcbjj43kumdq62kpqr72a

   To generate the full label, "dot-" get prefixed to the base32 encoded
   fingerprint.

4.2.  Handling by the recursive servers

4.2.1.  Servers supporting this specification

   When a recursive server gets the list of authoritative servers
   serving a specific zone, it gets a list of name of hosts.

   If:

   o  the first label is 56 bytes long

   o  AND the first 4 bytes matches "dot-"

   o  AND the remaining 52 bytes can be base32-decoded

   the recursive server will attempt to connect to the name server using
   TLS over port 853 and validate that the SHA256 hash of the SPKI in
   the certificate provided by the name server matches what was
   previously decoded.

   If the TLS session fail to establish, either unavailability of the
   service on port 853, TLS authentication failure, the behaviour of the
   recursive server depends on whether it is operating in strict or
   opportunistic mode ([I-D.ietf-dprive-dtls-and-tls-profiles]).

   In strict mode, the resolver MUST stop using this authoritative name
   server, and MUST try other servers of the DNS zone.  In opportunistic
   mode, the resolver MUST use the authoritative name server despite the
   failure.  It MAY try other name servers of the zone before, in the
   hope they will accept TLS and be authenticated.

4.2.2.  Servers not supporting this specification

   A server not supporting this specification will be unaware of
   anything special with this name server and consider it like any other
   name servers.
