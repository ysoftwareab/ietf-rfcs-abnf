Abstract

   The Intrusion Detection Parametrization Exchange Format (IDPEF)
   defines data formats and exchange procedures to standardize
   parametrization information exchange into intrusion detection and
   response systems from a Manager to an Analyzer.

   This Internet-Draft describes a data model to represent
   parametrization information of intrusion detection system entities,
   and explains the rationale for using this model. An implementation of
   the data model in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is presented,
   a XML Document Type Definition is developed, and parametrization
   examples are provided.

1. Introduction

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

1.1. Intention of this Format

   The Intrusion Detection Parametrization Exchange Format (IDPEF) is
   intended to be a standard data format to parametrize Intrusion
   Detection Systems (IDS). The development of this standardized format
   and the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) [2] will
   be enable in combination interoperability among commercial, open
   source, and research systems, allowing users to mix-and-match the
   deployment of these systems according to their strong and weak points
   to obtain an optimal IDS implementation.

   The most obvious place to implement IDPEF is in the data channel
   between a Manager and an Analyzer of an IDS within this data channel
   where the Manager sends the configuration parameters to the
   Analyzers. But there are other places where the IDPEF can be useful:

   o Combination of specialized IDS like application-IDS with server-
      IDS, WLAN-IDS and network-IDS to one functional interacting meta-
      IDS.

   o Management of different IDS vendors with one central management
      interface.

   o Interaction of different IDS by using IDPEF and IDMEF.

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   o A common data exchange format would make it easier for different
      organizations (users, vendors, response teams) to not only
      exchange data, but also communicate about it.

   o The diversity of uses for the IDPEF needs to be considered when
      selecting its method of implementation.

   o Parametrization backups and restore of parametrized IDS entities.

   o For a communication between a Manager and a Manager in a multi-
      stage management architecture.

1.2. Structure of this Document

   The remaining paper is organized as follows: The rest of section 1 is
   focused on the problems that will be addressed by IDPEF,
   architectural assumptions and the parametrization methodology.
   Section 2 defines basic communication procedures. General XML
   conventions for IDPEF are set out in section 3. The IDPEF data model
   and its nodes including each single attribute are defined in section
   4. Extending of IDPEF and special considerations are set out in the
   sections 5 and 6. Subsequent the section 7 to 10 include IANA
   considerations, a short conclusion and acknowledgements.

   Appendix A provides some examples for IDPEF so that unfamiliar
   readers are able to understand this document better. Appendix B shows
   the DTD of IDPEF and a non-normative XML Schema Definition of IDPEF
   is set out in Appendix C.

1.3. Rationale for IDPEF

   Methods of hacking are changing over periods of time and become more
   and more complex. As a result of this, techniques are developed to
   raise interoperability of IDS. One part is a standardized signalizing
   format to collect event messages of different IDS-entities. So the
   Intrusion Detection Exchange Format Working Group (IDWG) has
   standardized the communication between Analyzer and Manager with the
   Intrusion Detection eXchange Protocol (IDXP) [4]. As data format for
   events from Analyzer to Manager the Intrusion Detection Message
   Exchange Format (IDMEF) [2] was defined.

   Today, IDS are operating in encapsulated IT-landscapes. Many vendors
   provide IDS-functionalities in their network-components or
   applications and IDS-vendors focus their intrusion detection products
   to special services. Vendor-dependent tools and configurations are
   needed for administration. This is a big barrier of an extensive IDS-
   integration in complex environments. It is important to standardize

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   the communication between Manager and Analyzer for administration and
   operations, to combine IDS-Analyzers and Sensors of different vendors
   and integrate them into one IDS.

   Continuative of IDMEF, an exchange format for administration of IDS
   has to standardize the communication from Manager to Analyzer. As
   result a fully standardized communication between Managers and
   Analyzers enhance interoperability and integration of different IDS.
   As result, management front ends will become independent to IDS-
   Analyzers.

1.3.1. Problems Addressed by the Parametrization Data Model

   The data model addresses several problems associated with
   representing intrusion detection parameters:

   o Potential intrusion detection environments are very different. IDS
      are more and more specialized. Some Analyzers detect attacks by
      analyzing network traffic; others use operating system logs or
      application audit trail information. The combination of different
      specialized IDS, different vendors and/or analyzing techniques
      will be more and more important. Interaction of different IDS
      and/or vendors is not trivial, because parametrization information
      and formats are vendor-specific. The data model that represents
      different parametrization information MUST be highly standardized,
      but has to be also so flexible to support different needs of
      Analyzers and vendors.

   o Large enterprises have several security specialists with different
      focuses. The working focus of these security specialists requires
      different competences. Organizational upper security groups make
      regulations for their work. These groups have to handle different
      configuration structures today. So a standardized parametrization
      format makes it easier to exchange working results between IDS
      security specialists with different vendor focus.

   o Administrators are working with several specialized IDS-
      parametrization interfaces, sometimes distributed on separate
      systems. A standardized parametrization format helps to develop
      independent and consistent administration interfaces on one
      hardware platform. Administrators are then able to parametrize IDS
      of different vendors and analyzing level by using one
      administration interface. As result, the best administration
      interface for the operation focus could be selected.

   o A standardized communication allows combining several vendors and
      IDS-entities to operate like one IDS. The best fitting Analyzer
      will be integrated in the solution.

   o Research prototypes and specialized IDS like VoIP-IDS are able to
      be better integrated in existing IDS-architectures. Research
      results are better portable and interoperability of dedicate
      research-projects, like IDS management usability, alert
      correlations or automated signature generation [14], will be
      enhanced.

1.3.2. Data Model Design Focus

   The data model is designed to provide standardized parametrization
   for IDS entities. Together with IDMEF it allows to combine IDS-
   entities of different vendors to one meta-IDS.

   IDPEF provide a closed solution together with IDMEF. Therefore IDPEF
   provide at least parameters that are necessary for IDMEF.

   The data model design is focused on several IDS entities, their
   individual parameter structure and the feature set.

   Structure and format of the data model MUST be unambiguous. The
   information parameter to an event varies by the event itself and its
   characterizing parameters. For example, port-scans or ICMP-floods
   need a time-interval and a quantity of packets (port-request resp.
   icmp-packets) to characterize an intrusion. Also the event-name
   varies from vendor to vendor and it SHOULD be directly set as
   parameter value. Parameters of an Analyzer are individual and have to
   be requested by a general parameter request.

   This work is focused to standardize parametrization data and format
   to enhance the interoperability of IDS.

1.4. Architecture Assumptions

   Figure 1 is an enhanced illustration of functional IDS-entities. It
   illustrates the intrusion detection entities as defined in [3] and
   their relationships. Not every IDS will have all of these separate
   entities exactly as shown. Some IDS combine these components into a
   single module; some will have multiple instances of single modules.

   Based on a Data Source the Activity will be recognized and the Sensor
   examines necessary Event information and sends it to the Analyzer.
   The Analyzer checks the Event information against his Security
   Policy. The Manager is the entity, which act as single point of

   administration for the system. It provides the Security Policy,
   receives the Event notifications and coordinates Response entities
   which could be external to the identifying Analyzer.

                  Figure 1 Relationship of IDS entities.


   For the purposes of this document, we assume that the Analyzer and
   the Manager are separate components, and that they are communicating
   pair wise across a TCP/IP network. No other form of communication
   between these entities is contemplated in this document, and no other
   use of IDPEF is considered. As transport protocol for IDPEF the IDXP
   [4] will be used.

   The following points SHOULD NOT matter for the integration:

   o Whether Sensor and Analyzer are integrated or separated.


Boesch                Expires October 11, 2015                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   o Whether Analyzer and Manager are isolated, or embedded in some
      large hierarchy or distributed mesh of components.

   o Whether the Manager is used for configuration only or additionally
      used for notification and/or alert-correlation.

   o Whether a component might act as an Analyzer with respect to one
      component, while also acting as a Manager with respect to another.

   o Analyzers are homogeneous or meshed by multiple vendors or types.

1.5. Focus of Format

   The parametrization format is not designed to be used for initial
   setup or basic configuration of new / changed hardware. The focus of
   the parametrization format is to administer and operate different
   IDS-applications from one instance and by one user front end.

   The format is not intent for signalization. Focus is the
   administration with parametrization and parametrization request of
   different IDS-applications with a standardized procedure.

   The format MUST NOT be designed to create signature or anomaly
   pattern. This information has to be created external and uploaded as
   update file.

1.6. Parametrization Methodology

   IDS compares Activity against a reference database. References
   consist of a baseline part and a customizing part. The baseline part
   describes the event itself (intrusion activity, vulnerability or
   baseline). Baseline parts are customized to the individual
   implementation. For example, a SYN-flood contains in the baseline
   part the attack description. In this case, the TCP/IP protocol with a
   set SYN-flag. The customizing part defines threshold and a time
   interval for the individual implementation of the event. As result,
   the SYN-request (attack description) has to occur more than 200 times
   (threshold) within 1 second (time interval) to cause a SYN-flood
   signalization. The baseline part of a rule is vendor-specific and
   depends on the internal processing of Sensor and Analyzer. Therefore
   it is out of scope for parametrization. IDPEF customizes the vendor-
   specific baseline-part to the individual implementation of the IDS
   entity.

2. The Communication Proceeding

   The communication proceeding has to work in different IDS architec-
   tures. The transport protocol IDXP [4] is responsible for transport
   and grants appropriate security. The basic communication proceeding
   within IDXP for the format exchange is described in detail here.

   Protection of the communication and the exchanged content between IDS
   entities is focus of TLS [12], BEEP [11] and other integration
   mechanisms. These are not part of the communication proceeding of
   IDPEF, but MUST be granted by the transport protocol.

   The following points do not have influence on communication and
   format:

   o Different analyzing techniques

   o mixed feature sets, versions and/or vendors

   o Different sensor types

   o Parametrization status of Sensors if they are completely or only
      partial or not parametrized or have a mix of parametrization
      states.

   o If a Manager parametrize an Analyzer directly or over a second
      Manager.

2.1. Parametrization Communication

   A change of the Manager SHOULD be done with minimal impact and
   expenditure of work time. The Manager does not provide any feature or
   parameter information of Analyzers. An information request is a good
   way to allow more than one Manager to administrate individual
   Analyzers. The parametrization proceeds global like:

   Manager:                                                   Analyzer:

2.2. Version Update on Hierarchical Lower IDS-Entities

   The parametrization format has to support update of hierarchical
   lower IDS entities i.e. updates from a Manager to an Analyzer.
   Updates will be terminated to a time specification - derivate
   absolute (e.g. 23:00) or relative terminations (e.g. +02:00) are
   possible. An update file numeration defines the update order.

   The update has to be checked after every update execution and an
   update status will be send. If an update execution fails, all
   following updates SHOULD set out and not be executed. A notification
   SHOULD be sent for each update file if the update processing is
   canceled. Updates will be applied like:

   Manager:                                             Analyzer:

3. The IDPEF XML Implementation

   The IDPEF implementation uses a Document Type Definition (DTD) to
   describe XML documents. The XML solution was primary selected,
   because it provides a closed solution together with IDMEF.

   A widely spread and powerful used standard is XML and its flexibility
   makes it a good choice for applications, also for implementing the
   IDPEF as well. Other, more specific reasons for choosing XML to
   implement the IDPEF are:

   o Software tools for processing XML documents are widely available,
      as commercial and open source version. Numerous tools and
      programming interfaces for parsing and/or validating XML are
      available in a variety of languages. Widespread access to tools
      makes adoption of the IDPEF by product developers easier and
      faster. Web technologies like Java Script enables an easy
      processing of XML.

   o XML supports fully internationalization and localization for IT
      solutions that cross political and/or cultural boarders. So XML
      enables a global usage to parametrize the Analyzer to the
      individual implementation and to maintain the IDS in operations.
      UTF-8, UTF-16 and Unicode makes XML applications compatible with
      these common character encodings.




Boesch                Expires October 11, 2015               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   o XML also provides support for specifying, on a per-element basis,
      the language in which the element's content is written, making
      IDPEF easy to adapt to "Natural Language Support" versions of a
      product.

   o XML is free and has no license, license fees or royalties.

   o XML is human readable. Security teams are able to revise the
      parametrization or publish specification guidelines for IDS.

3.1. Notational Conventions and Formatting Issues

   The IDPEF description bases on three specifications:

   o The data-model bases on a Unified Modeling Language description.

   o XML describes the markup used in IDPEF documents

   o Documents are represented in IDPEF markup.

   In appendix A these notations will be described in sufficient detail
   by examples so that unfamiliar readers are able to understand the
   document. These descriptions are not comprehensive. They only cover
   the components of the notations used by the data model and document
   format.

   Several document formatting issues will be shown in appendix A
   (examples) and Appendix C. These will be applying to XML documents,
   including formats for particular data types, special character and
   white space processing, character sets and languages.

3.2. IDPEF XML Documents

   This section describes basic IDPEF XML document formatting rules.
   Most of these rules are based of rules for formatting XML documents.

3.2.1. The Document Header - The XML Declaration

   IDPEF documents will be exchanged between IDPEF compliant
   applications. The exchange begins with an XML declaration, followed
   by the used XML version. Specification of the used encoding is
   RECOMMENDED.

   Each XML document contains a document type declaration (DTD). The DTD
   represents significant overhead by bandwidth consume and performance
   for XML processing to an IDPEF compliant parametrization message. To
   reduce these negatives Analyzers and Managers agree on a particular

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   DTD via a local reference to the accessing Manager. Therefore IDPEF
   messages has to start with:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

   <IDPEF:IDPEF-version="1.0"

                    xmlns:idpef="http://manager.example.org/idpef"/>

3.2.2. Character Data Processing in IDPEF

   The character processing was already defined for IDMEF [2], and will
   be also used analogue for IDPEF. The section will be recapitulated
   here for better understanding:

   IDPEF compliant applications and messages SHOULD use the character
   encodings UTF-8 or UTF-16 only to grand portability. If no encoding
   is specified for an IDPEF message, UTF-8 will be assumed, consistent
   with the XML standard.

   IDPEF documents encoded in UTF-16 MUST begin with the Byte Order
   Mark. This is consistent to ISO/IEC 10646 Annex E and Unicode
   Appendix B (the "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" character, #xFEFF).

   It is RECOMMENDED that IDPEF compliant applications use the entity
   form (section 4.1 of [10]) of the characters '&', ,'<', '>', '"', and
   ''' (single-quote) whenever writing these characters in data, to
   avoid any possibility of misinterpretation [2].

   Analogue to the IDMEF specification, the "xml:space" attribute have
   to be supported for all IDPEF elements for white space processing
   [6].

3.2.3. Languages in IDPEF

   The language of the content is encoded and has to be specified in
   IDPEF compliant communication. This will be done in a generally way
   by applying the attribute "xml:lang" for the top-level element [9].
   All other elements will inherit that definition else the language has
   to be specified separately for a single element branch. This
   specification is set for the single / data record.

3.3. IDPEF Data Types

   XML is a text formatting language and all data will be expressed as
   "text" (as opposed to "binary") within an XML IDPEF message, except
   it is explicated declared here.

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   Each data type in the model has specific formatting requirements in
   an XML IDPEF message. The data types are Integers, Real Numbers,
   Bytes, Enumerated Types, Date Time Strings [7], Port Lists and also
   Characters and Strings which are already defined in the IDMEF data
   model specification [2].

3.4. Case-sensitivity

   All values are not case-sensitive, except it will be explicit defined
   here.

4. The IDPEF Parametrization Data Model

   This section illustrates the structure of the IDPEF parametrization
   and the relationship between single elements. The individual elements
   are explained in detail in the respective section of parametrization
   nodes.

   The IDPEF parametrization model describes only the node structure of
   the parametrization information. The communication procedure was
   already described in section 2.

4.1. Overview

   The structure of the IDPEF core components is displayed in figure 2.
   The top level node (root node) is called "IDPEF-Message".

   The "IDPEF-Message" node is structured in the three sections
   "entity", "alert" and "update". Each section focuses on detailed
   parametrization information for global analyzer information, event
   parametrization and updates.

   information about the environment of the device. Figure 2 illustrates
   the structure of the "entity" section on the left side.

   The node "entity" accumulates the child nodes "network", "location",
   "tadmin" and "fservice". The three nodes "location", "tadmin" and
   "fservice" contain the additional node "address". The nodes "tadmin"
   and "fservice" include additionally the node "contact".

   The node "entity" contains characterizing attributes of the entity.
   The "entity" node is represented in the IDPEF DTD as:

     MUST be defined unique by the Manager or the Administrator. This
     value is case-sensitive.

   reference-time

     OPTIONAL: The "reference-time" is the time of the Manager. Time
     differences between the local IDS entity and the central IDS
     Manager will be eliminated. By timely relative updates this
     attribute is REQUIRED.

   exec-time

     REQUIRED: The "exec-time" terminates the time of execution start.
     If no reference-time is specified, the exec-time refer to the
     system time of the entity.





   type

     REQUIRED: Defines the kind of update. The value "update" is used
     for patches, updates and upgrades. "backup" is used to collect all
     important files for a parameter restore and the value "restore" is
     used to restore a parameter configuration by the transferred file.

4.2.3.1. update-file

   The "update-file" node specifies name and location of the update
   files. Additional notifications for each update result will be
   specified. This node uses the attribute "notification" to specify the
   result notification of each update file execution. So this node will

   ninfo

     OPTIONAL: This attribute contains additional static information to
     the IDS entity or the notification. This value is case-sensitive.

4.2.3.2. data

     This node is REQUIRED and contains the (binary) update file in
     base64 coded format. This value is case-sensitive.

4.2.4. The Alert Section

   The "alert" section includes the groups for parametrization of events
   and reactions. The "alert" section is used to group and parametrize
   single "event" and the "react" nodes for signalizations or responses.
   So the "alert" section structures all "event" and "react" nodes with
   group nodes. The "alert" section will be represented in the IDPEF DTD
   as:

     <!ELEMENT alert     (

          group*

     )>



4.2.4.1. group

   The node "group" contains the parametrization nodes for events and
   reactions. The "event" nodes are used to parametrize single events
   and the "react" nodes contain general notification parameters for
   signalizations or responses. So the "group" node structures all
   "event" and "react" nodes for a clustering of events and responses.
   The "group" child node will be represented in the IDPEF DTD as:

     <!ELEMENT group     (

          event*, react*

     REQUIRED: This attribute defines the identification for the goup.
     This value is case-sensitive.



4.2.4.1.1. event

   In the "event" node all parameters to an alert will be defined. So
   this node based on the nodes "connection", "system" and "ipara".

   Each "event" node contains 12 attributes:

   enable

     REQUIRED: The "enable" attribute defines if this alert is active or
     not ("yes" or "no").

   name

     REQUIRED: This attribute defines the vendor-specific identification
     for the event. This value is case-sensitive.

   displayedas

     REQUIRED: This value will be displayed in case of alarming /
     notification. It SHOULD briefly characterize the occurred event.
     This value is case-sensitive.





   impact

     OPTIONAL: This attribute specifies, which security value
     (preferred: "confidence", "integrity", "availability" and/or
     "none") would be affected by this attack.

   severity

     REQUIRED: The value of the attribute severity characterizes the
     intrusion impact in context to other systems and/or applications.
     The severity supports Operators to aggregate all severities of a
     complex and several intrusions. This value is split in
     "informational", "low", "medium", and "high" or a numeric rating
     (e.g CVSS base value).

   priority

     OPTIONAL: The priority supports Operators to decide which intrusion
     has to be observed and what will be primary reported for
     statistical information like port-scans or sporadic connection
     failures. In case of multiple detections of several simultaneous

     intrusions this value supports the Operator on which intrusion
     should be the focus and in which order are the intrusions to
     respond. This value covers a range from 1 to 255.

   interface

     OPTIONAL: The attribute interface defines the interface for the
     alert parameters if possible / necessary.

   origin

     OPTIONAL: References the origin of this event: unknown, vendor-
     specific, user-specific, bugtraqid, cve, osvdb, etc. It could also
     include a link for more information about this event. This value is
     case-sensitive.

   frequency

     OPTIONAL: Specifies the threshold within the measure interval, how
     often the event has to occur or a percentage value (threshold or
     change), before the event will be raised.





   interval

     OPTIONAL: The "interval" attribute specifies the measure interval
     in seconds for the value in "frequency", before the event will be
     raised.

   ignore

     OPTIONAL: Defines an inactivity period of this event in seconds,
     after it was raised. This prevents that a recurrent event floods
     the alert panel.

   ngroup

     REQUIRED: This attribute will be used to map the notification for
     this event.

4.2.4.1.1.1. connection

   The "connection" node summarizes all parameters related to the
   network connection. So the node "connection" will be represented in
   the IDPEF DTD as:

   <!ATTLIST connection

       source         PCDATA                           #REQUIRED

       destination    PCDATA                           #REQUIRED

       port           PCDATA                           #REQUIRED

       direction      (bidirectional|unidirectional)   #REQUIRED

   >

   Each "connection" node contains the four attributes:

   source

     REQUIRED: This attribute defines the initiating IP-address of the
     connection. It will be used in dotted form with OPTIONAL "/" with
     netmask in dotted or bit-noted form. Multiple IP-addresses or
     address ranges will be separated with a comma. IP-address ranges
     could be specified by a hyphen (-) operator or netmask after a
     slash (/) or wild card operator (*) like 192.168.*.10.



   destination

     REQUIRED: This attribute defines the destination IP-address of the
     connection. It will be used in dotted form with OPTIONAL "/" with
     netmask in dotted or bit-noted form. Multiple IP-Addresses will be
     separated with a comma. IP-address ranges could be specified by a
     hyphen (-) operator or netmask after a slash (/) or wild card
     operator (*) like 192.168.*.10.

   port

     REQUIRED: Defines the destination port or a port range for this
     event. A port range will be specified by a hyphen operator (-).
     Multiple ports or port ranges are separated by a comma (,).

   direction

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


     REQUIRED: This attribute defines if the connection parameters will
     be analyzed in both directions (bidirectional) or only in the
     defined direction from source to destination (unidirectional).

4.2.4.1.1.2. system

   The node "system" pools the attributes for system specific
   parameters. The DTD representation for this node is:

   <!ATTLIST system

       type          PCDATA               #Required

       value         PCDATA               #Required

       enable        (yes|no)    'yes'    #Required

   >

   type

     REQUIRED: This attribute defines the type for the value, e.g. if it
     is a directory or a file.

   value

     REQUIRED: This attribute defines the value of the attribute.
     Multiple values are separated with a comma (,). This value is case-
     sensitive.

   enable

     REQUIRED: The "enable" attribute defines if this alert is active or
     not.

4.2.4.1.1.3. ipara

   The "ipara" node provides individual parameter-extensions. So it is
   possible to set individual parameter names which are not predefined.
   The "ipara" node provides the attributes "name", "value" and "time".
   So the DTD representation for this node is:



   <!ATTLIST ipara

       enable        (yes|no)      'yes'     #Required


Boesch                Expires October 11, 2015               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


       name          PCDATA                  #Required

       value         PCDATA                  #Required

       time          (time)

   >

   So this node includes this four attributes:

   enable

     REQUIRED: The "enable" attribute defines if this alert is active or
     not.

   name

     REQUIRED: The attribute "name" defines the name of the individual
     parameter for a correct assignment. This value is case-sensitive.

   value

     REQUIRED: The attribute "value" contains the individual parameter
     of the individual attribute. This value is case-sensitive.

   time

     OPTIONAL: This attribute defines a time interval (i.e. 3600) in
     seconds or a local time window (i.e. 10:00:00 - 23:00:00) for the
     specified attribute. The time interval specifies an increase or
     decrease of the attribute "value". If a time interval will be
     defined the value of the attribute "value" is a fixed threshold.

4.2.4.1.2. react

   The response and notification parametrization depends mainly on the
   feature set of the single IDS entity. All parametrized responses and
   notifications MUST be checked before the local IDS entity accepts the
   configuration. The "react" node will be represented in the IDPEF DTD
   as:

   <!ATTLIST react

       enable      (yes|no)      'yes'       #REQUIRED

       rid         PCDATA                    #REQUIRED

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


       type        PCDATA                    #REQUIRED

       structure   PCDATA

       iaddress    PCDATA                    #REQUIRED

   >

   The "react" node contains the five attributes:

   enable

     REQUIRED: The "enable" attribute defines if this alert is active or
     not ("yes" or "no").

   rid

     REQUIRED: This attribute specifies the unique ID of the reaction
     (response or notification).

   type

     REQUIRED: This attribute specifies the notification or response
     type that will be taken by an identified attack. This could be a
     block of this packet / connection by the Sensor or another device,
     a redirect to a honey net, to take the sever offline, or an attack
     signalization only.



   structure

     OPTIONAL: Some notification content has an open structure. This
     attribute defines the notification content. This value is case-
     sensitive.

   iaddress

     REQUIRED: The attribute "iaddress" contains the IP-address (IPv4 or
     IPv6) of the notification receiving system or phone-number for SMS
     notification.

5. Extending the IDPEF

   IDS will be still developed in the future. Standardized protocols
   MUST be the cutting edge to support research prototypes. So IDPEF has
   to support state of the art requirements of research projects.


Boesch                Expires October 11, 2015               [Page 38]

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   To fulfill the requirements IDPEF will be extended by using
   individual parameter option "ipara". This will support a lot of
   variants to extend the IDPEF.

6. Special Considerations

6.1. XML Validity and Well-Formalness

   Instead to include the DTD in the IDPEF compliant communication, it
   will be defined in the header of the IDPEF-Message. Such IDPEF
   documents will be well-formed and valid as defined in [5]. Other
   IDPEF documents will be specified that a document header will be not
   included (e.g. entries in an IDPEF-format configuration file). This
   IDPEF documents are well-formed but not valid.

   A document has a single element that contains everything else, and
   that all other elements embedded nicely within each other without any
   overlapping. Only in this case a document is valid and well-formed.

   A document is valid when it is well-formed, but it follows also
   specific events (contained in the DTD) about which elements are
   allowed in the document. A document could not be valid without a DTD.

   XML processors have to parse valid documents only. Without
   validation, a document may contain elements in nonsense order and
   could not process correctly. A not valid document is not suited for a
   proper parameter transfer. So IDPEF documents MUST be valid.
   Documents which are not valid abet misparametrizations and will be
   not processed or applied.

6.2. Unrecognized XML Tags

   In case that an IDPEF compliant application receives a well-formed
   and valid IDPEF message containing tags that it does not understand,
   this IDPEF message MUST continue to process, provided that such
   messages meet the well-formatting requirement of section 6.1. It is
   up to the individual application to decide how to process (or ignore)
   any content from the unknown element(s). Unrecognized tags MUST be
   notified and the new running parametrization of the entity will be
   sent back as reply message. Within the replied IDPEF message the
   errorcode has to be set with the errorcodes:

              100: ok

              200: Request or Update not valid

              250: Request or Update not well-formed

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


              300: Internal processing error by the XML

              400: Activation of new parameters failed, restart with old

                 parametrization.

7. Security Considerations

   IDPEF does not treat security matters directly. It is only an
   exchange format to standardize and structure parametrization
   information of IDS. So IDPEF could be used local by the IDS software
   or in combination with a transport protocol like IDXP [4] between
   Manager and Analyzers. So the security considerations are made in the
   rfc of IDXP [4], BEEP [11], TLS [12] and SASL [13]. So summarized
   considerations are made here:

7.1. Systems Security Issues

   The local usage of IDPEF data (i.e. configuration files) MUST be
   protected at least against unauthorized usage, inappropriate usage
   and / or Denial of Service of the data. So confidentiality and
   integrity of local IDPEF data (e.g. configuration files) MUST be
   handled in responsibility of the particular IDS software. A peer
   entity authentication within closed local software is not required.
   To provide most flexibility the IDS software MUST be choose which
   mechanisms are adequate and have to ensure that its configuration
   data is sufficient and state of the art protected.

   The remote provisioning of IDPEF data MUST be protected against
   unauthorized usage, inappropriate usage. All transmitted IDPEF data
   have to be accepted from the Analyzers. The Manager has to ensure,
   that only appropriate data corresponding to the authorization will be
   transmitted to the Analyzers. The Manager authorizes as appropriate
   managing peer entity. So the Manager has to check and enforce the
   authorization of its local users or managing peer entities. The
   Manager will be authorized as appropriate Manager based on SASL
   mechanisms.

7.2. Communications Security Issues

   IDPEF itself provides no transport security and depends on the
   security of the transport protocol. In case of transmission of IDPEF
   between Manager and Analyzer the transport protocol IDXP [4] MUST be
   guaranteed adequate data integrity, confidentiality and peer entity
   authentication of the transferred message. The IDPEF use the security
   features of the transport protocol IDXP [4].



Boesch                Expires October 11, 2015               [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   The IDXP profile is a profile of BEEP [11]. The BEEP provides
   separate mechanisms for transport security, user authentication, and
   data exchange. The IDXP profile MUST initially negotiate a BEEP
   security profile between the peers that offers the REQUIRED security
   properties. The TLS and SASL profile MUST be used to provide for
   transport security for IDPEF data. TLS supports cipher suites that
   provide varying levels of security. Administrators SHOULD use the
   strongest cipher suite but SHOULD also carefully choose which cipher
   suites are provisioned.

7.2.1. Passive Attacks

7.2.1.1. Confidentiality Violations (Eavesdropping)

   Confidentiality violations such as eavesdropping are a serious attack
   against IDPEF data. So the transport protocol IDXP [4] MUST be used
   with the TLS and SASL profiles so that the communication is adequate
   protected.

7.2.1.2. Password Sniffing

   IDPEF MAY also handle among others authentication information. Due to
   the circumstances that IDPEF provides itself no transport security
   confidentiality, integrity and peer entity authentication MUST be
   provided by SASL and TLS profile option of the BEEP framing
   mechanisms of IDXP. IDPEF MUST NOT used without the TLS and SASL
   options of BEEP.

7.2.1.3. Offline Cryptographic Attacks

   Offline cryptographic attacks are a serious risk to configuration
   information. To hamper this kind of attacks Analyzer and Manager
   SHOULD provide and use always state of the art algorithms. So the
   Analyzer SHOULD refuse weak cryptographic algorithms for
   confidentiality and / or authentication. The BEEP as framing
   mechanism for IDXP has to be used with the TLS and SASL option.

7.2.2. Active Attacks

7.2.2.1. Replay Attacks

   To protect messages against replay IDPEF will be transmitted via IDXP
   [4] with TLS [12] option of the BEEP [11] framing mechanisms. The
   appropriate level of security MUST be chosen by the administrator
   carefully. To protect application data refer to Appendix F2 of [12]
   for a discussion of security considerations.

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


7.2.2.2. Message Insertion

   To protect messages against insertions IDPEF will be transmitted via
   IDXP [4] with TLS [12] option of the BEEP [11] framing mechanisms.
   The appropriate level of security MUST be chosen by the administrator
   carefully. To protect application data refer to Appendix F of [12]
   for a discussion of security considerations.

7.2.2.3. Message Deletion

   The communication proceeding of IDPEF ensures, that parameter
   modification messages (classified as parameter-update) MUST send back
   (classified as parameter-reply) so that the send Manager is able to
   compare the send update message and the received update response.
   Other deleted messages are uncritical and could be requested a second
   time.

   On transport layer IDXP as profile of the BEEP framing mechanisms
   provided additional mechanisms to ensure a correct message transport
   to the peer entity.

7.2.2.4. Message Modification

   To protect messages against modification IDPEF will be transmitted
   via IDXP [4] with TLS [12] option of the BEEP [11] framing
   mechanisms. The appropriate level of security MUST be chosen by the
   administrator carefully. To protect application data refer to
   Appendix F2 of [12] for a discussion of security considerations.

7.2.2.5. Man-In-The-Middle

   IDPEF MUST be transported with TLS and SASL options in BEEP of IDXP.
   IDXP as profile of the BEEP framing mechanisms with focus on man-in-
   the-middle-attacks is already under discussion in Section 9 of [11]
   for the security considerations.

7.2.3. Topological Issues

   Architectural solutions like firewalls and separated networks keep
   the IDS communication in a WALLED GARDEN to make the communication
   safer. This protect also against Denial of Service attacks.

7.2.4. Denial of Service

   None of these security measures provides any real protection against
   denial of service. Based on the transport layer security (SASL and
   TLS) of BEEP connections, it is possible to limit a variety of

Internet-Draft                The IDPEF                     April 2015


   attacks on individual connections using forged RSTs or other kinds of
   packet injection.

7.3. Digital Signatures

   IDPEF assigns responsibility for integrity and authentication of the
   message to the communications protocol IDXP [4], not the message
   format. However, in situations where IDPEF messages are
   parametrization part of a local configuration file, or in cases where
   the digital signatures MUST be archived for later use, the inclusion
   of digital signatures within an IDPEF message itself may be
   desirable.

   Specifications for the use of digital signatures [14] within IDPEF
   messages are outside the scope of this document. However, if such
   functionality is needed, use of the XML signature standard is
   RECOMMENDED.

8. IANA Considerations

   The IDMEF is registered by the IANA. For the IDPEF there will be no
   need to register the specifications by the IANA [15]. The individual
   development and/or enhancement of the DTD and their attribute values
   SHOULD offer more flexibility for the use of the IDPEF and the DTD
   reference links to the Manager of the IDS composite. So no IANA
   registrations will be aspired.

9. Conclusions

   With IDPEF IDS are able to operate under one common independent IDS
   Manager. As result, the IDS Manager was separated from the rest of an
   IDS and could integrate Analyzers of different vendors and analyzing
   levels.

   Customizing of IDS could be due to a small amount of parameters and
   values. Baseline configuration and references depend on the internal
   processing and are not able to be standardized by a common format.

   With a single central administration entity it is possible to
   operate, manage, maintain and administer a heterogeneous IDS
   composite based on a small format. All connections are initialized
   from the central Manager to the distributed Analyzer entities. All
   updates (parameter and software) could be controlled, downloaded and
   distributed to each single IDS entity from one central management
   entity.

   Connections from an IDS Analyzer entity to a system outside the
   administrative IDS LAN are not necessary. The Manager still defines
   the border of autonomous acted IDS but the environment is not longer
   vendor-specific. The Manager is an independent system of IDS and
   could be separated from the rest of the IDS. It is possible to
   operate different IDS with one consistently administration front end.
   This enables new and independent evolution streams for IDS Analyzer
   as well as Manager.
