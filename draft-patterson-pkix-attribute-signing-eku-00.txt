Abstract

   This document specifies a value for the extendedKeyUsage X.509
   extension that may be used to create a certificate that would be used
   to sign attribute assertions.  This allows the differentiation of
   certificates used to identify a particular server (which would have a
   serverAuth EKU), from the certificate used by that server to sign
   attribute assertions, and would easily allow a policy to be developed
   for issuance of such a certificate to an identity provider.

2.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines the extendedKeyUsage X.509 extension for the PKIX
   Internet Certificate Profile.  This document extends that definition,
   and defines a new value for extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-assertionSigning)
   which allows for a relying party to know that the holder of the
   Certificate has been certified according to the Issuing Certification
   Authority's (CA) requirements for a provider of attribute
   information.

   This value MAY be used instead of requiring a dedicated Federation
   Enabler Certification Authority for issuing certificates to Identity
   Providers or Attribute Providers in a WS-Fed or SAML federation.  A
   conformant CA MAY set up a particular Certificate Profile which is
   only issued after ensuring that the subject of the certificate is
   operating according to a given set of guidelines, as established by a
   given federation.  By including this extendedKeyUsage, a conformant
   CA can distinguish certificates issued to an Identity Provider or
   Attribute Provider as distinct from any other certificates issued to
   devices such as web servers, etc.  A Relying Party MAY use this to be
   certain that the presenter of the certificate containing this is an
   authorised Identity Provider within a given federation.  Federation
   Realm determination is out of scope of this document.

   If id-kp-assertionSigning is declared in extendedKeyUsage, then no
   other extendedKeyUsage values SHOULD be set.  If id-kp-
   assertionSigning is declared in extendedKeyUsage, a conformant CA
   SHALL set the digitalSignature bit in the keyUsage extension.  A
   conformant CA MAY also set the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage
   extension.  A conformation CA SHOULD NOT set the keyEncipherment,
   keyAgreement, or dataEncipherment bits in keyUsage.  The Certificate
   MUST NOT have crlSign, or certSign bits set in keyUsage.

   Certificates with this bit set SHOULD NOT be used as the primary
   identity certificate for the identity provider (e.g.: Should not be
   the same Certificate as used for SSL Authentication).

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo defines a new value 'id-kp-assertionSigning' to signify
   that the certificate that contains this value was issued to a
   provider of identity attribute information.

   id-kp-assertionSigning OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-kp TBD}
