1.  Introduction

   This document describes a framework for Pseudo Wires Emulation Edge-
   to-Edge (PWE3).  It discusses the emulation of circuits (such as T1,
   E1, T3 and E3) and services (such as ATM and Frame relay) over packet
   networks using IP, L2TP or MPLS for transport.  It presents an
   architectural framework for pseudo wires, defines terminology,
   specifies the various protocol elements and their functions,
   overviews the services supported and discusses how pseudo wires fit
   into the broader context of protocols.

1.1.  What Are Pseudo Wires?

1.1.1.  Definition

   A pseudo wire (PW) is a mechanism that emulates the essential
   attributes of a service (such as a T1 leased line or Frame Relay)
   over a packet network.  The required functions of PWs include
   encapsulating service-specific bit-streams or PDUs arriving at an
   ingress port, and carrying them across a path or tunnel, managing
   their timing and order, and any other operations required to emulate
   the behavior and characteristics of the service as faithfully as
   possible.

   From the customer perspective, the PW is perceived as an unshared
   link or circuit of the chosen service.  However, there may be
   deficiencies that impede some applications from being carried on a
   PW.  These limitations should be fully described in the appropriate
   service-specific Applicability Statements (ASes).

1.1.2.  Functions

   PWs provide the following functions in order to emulate the behavior
   and characteristics of the desired service.

   - Encapsulation of service-specific PDUs or circuit data arriving at
     an ingress port (logical or physical).

   - Transporting the encapsulated data across a tunnel.

   - Managing the signaling, timing, order or other aspects of the
     service at the boundaries of the PW.

   ASes for each service will describe any shortfalls of the emulation's
   faithfulness.

Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

1.2.  Goals of This Document

   - Description of the motivation for creating PWs, and some background
     on how they may be deployed.

   - Description of an architecture and terminology for PWs.

   - Description of the relevant services that will be supported by PWs,
     including any relevant service-specific considerations.

   - Description of methods to ensure in-order final PDU delivery,

   - Description of methods to perform clock recovery, as needed or
     appropriate.

   - Description of methods to perform edge-to-edge/inband signaling
     functions across the transport network as needed or appropriate.

   - Description of the statistics and other network management
     information needed for tunnel operation and management.

   - Description of the security mechanisms to be used to protect the
     control of the PW technology.  The protection of the encapsulated
     content (e.g., payload encryption) of the PW is outside of scope.

   - Description of a mechanism to exchange encapsulation control
     information at an administrative boundary of the transport network,
     including security methods.

   - Whenever possible, relevant requirements from existing IETF
     documents and other sources will be incorporated by reference.

1.3.  Non-Goals

   The following are out of scope:

   - The protection of the encapsulated content of the PW.

   - Any multicast service not native to the emulated medium.  Thus,
     Ethernet transmission to a "multicast" IEEE-48 address is in scope,
     while multicast services like MARS that are implemented on top of
     the medium are out of scope.

   - Methods to signal the underlying network

2.  Background and Motivation

   Many of today's service providers are struggling with the dilemma of
   moving to an optical network based on IP and/or MPLS.  How do they
   realize the capital and operational benefits of a new packet-based
   optical infrastructure, while leveraging the existing base of SONET
   (Synchronous Optical Network) gear, and while also protecting the
   large revenue stream associated with this equipment?  How do they
   move from mature Frame Relay or ATM networks, while still being able
   to provide these lucrative services?  One possibility is the
   emulation of circuits or services, currently referred to as "pseudo
   wires" in the IETF.  Circuit emulation over ATM and interworking of
   Frame Relay and ATM have already been standardized.  Emulation allows
   the transport of existing circuits and/or services across the new
   infrastructure, and thus enables the interworking of disparate
   networks.  [ATMCES] provides some insight into the requirements for
   such a service:

        There is a user demand for carrying certain types of
        constant bit rate (CBR) or "circuit" traffic over
        Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.  As ATM is
        essentially a packet- rather than circuit-oriented
        transmission technology, it must emulate circuit
        characteristics in order to provide good support for CBR
        traffic.

        A critical attribute of a Circuit Emulation Service (CES)
        is that the performance realized over ATM should be
        comparable to that experienced with the current PDH/SDH
        technology.

   Section 4 of [ANAVI] gives more background on why such emulation is
   desirable:

        The simplicity of TDMoIP translates into initial
        expenditure and operational cost benefits. In addition, due
        to its transparency TDMoIP can support mixed voice, data
        and video services. It is transparent to both protocols and
        signaling, irrespective of whether they are standards based
        or proprietary with full timing support and the capability
        of maintaining the integrity of framed and unframed DS1
        formats.

2.1.  Current Network Architecture

2.1.1.  Multiple Networks

   The current "network" for any given service provider delivering
   multiple services usually consists of parallel networks.  Each of
   these networks implements a specific service, such as voice, Frame
   Relay, internet access, etc.  This is quite expensive, both in terms
   of capital expense as well as in operational costs.  Furthermore,

Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                   [Page 7] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   multiple networks complicates planning.  Service providers wind up
   asking themselves these questions:

   - Which network do I build out?

   - How many fibers do I need for each network?

   - How do I efficiently manage multiple networks?

2.1.2.  Convergence Today

   There are some examples of convergence in today's network:

   - Frame Relay is frequently carried over ATM networks using [FRF.5]
     interworking.

   - T1, E1 and T3 circuits are sometimes carried over ATM networks
     using [ATMCES].

   - Voice is carried over Frame Relay and IP networks.

   Deployment of these examples range from limited (ATM CES) to fairly
   common (FRF.5 interworking) to widespread (VoIP).

2.2.  The Emerging Converged Network

   Many service providers are finding that the new IP-based and MPLS-
   based switching systems are much less costly to acquire, deploy and
   maintain than the systems that they replace.  The new systems take
   advantage of advances in technology in these ways:

   - The newer systems leverage mass production of ASICs and optical
     interfaces to reduce capital expense.

   - The bulk of the traffic in the network today originates from packet
     sources.  Packet switches can economically switch and transport
     this traffic natively.

   - Variable-length switches have lower system costs than ATM due to
     simpler switching mechanisms as well as elimination of segmentation
     and reassembly (SAR) at the edges of the network.

   - Deployment of services is simpler due to the connectionless nature
     of IP services or the rapid provisioning of MPLS applications.

2.3.  Transition to the New Network

   The emergence of a converged network solves many of the problems
   faced by service providers, but the old networks and services don't
   just go away.  Use of PWs can help facilitate this transition with
   these benefits.

   - Leverage the low capital and operational expenses of packet
     networks.

   - Simple provisioning.

   - Provide a transition path to a converged network.

   Editor's Note: this section needs more work.

3.  Architecture of Pseudo Wires

3.1.  Reference Model

   Figure 1 below shows the reference model for PWs.

           |<---------------- emulated service ---------------->|

       endpoint 1                                             endpoint 2

                       Figure 1: PW Reference Model

   As shown, the PW provides an emulated service between the service
   endpoints.  Any bits or packets presented at the service access are
   encapsulated in a PW PDU and carried across the underlying network.
   The PW endpoints (PWE) perform the encapsulation, decapsulation,
   order management, timing and any other functions required by the
   service.  The underlying transport network is not involved in any of
   these service-specific operations.

3.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  Below are
   the definitions for the terms used throughout the document.

   Pseudo Wire             The Pseudo Wire (PW) is a mechanism that
                           emulates the essential attributes of a
                           service, providing this emulation over a
                           packet network.

   Pseudo Wire Domain      A PW Domain (PWD) is a collection of
                           instances of PWs that are within the scope of
                           a single homogenous administrative domain
                           (e.g. PW over MPLS network or PW over IP
                           network etc.).

   Pseudo Wire Endpoint    The PW Endpoint (PWE) is a device that
                           provides the adaptation between the end
                           service and the PW.


Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 10] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   Pseudo Wire PDU         The PW-PDU is a PDU sent on the PW that
                           contains all of the data and control
                           information necessary to provide the desired
                           service.

   Service Endpoint        The Service Endpoint (SE) is the point of
                           termination for the emulated service.

   Network Interworking    Network Interworking means that the ingress
                           and egress of the PW interfaces are identical
                           (e.g. ATM-to-ATM, Frame Relay-to-Frame Relay
                           etc.).  The interworking function (IWF) at
                           the edge of the PW performs the service
                           mapping (e.g. ATM Cell Loss priority (CLP)
                           maps to EXP field in MPLS header) on the
                           service data unit (SDU) (e.g.  ATM cell) to
                           ensure the service transparency while
                           transporting the SDU data transparently
                           across the PWD.

   Service Interworking    Service Interworking means that the ingress
                           and egress of the PW interfaces are different
                           (e.g. ATM-to-Frame Relay).  The interworking
                           function at the ingress edge of the network
                           terminates the SDU transport (e.g. ATM AAL5
                           PDU transport)and performs service mapping
                           between the ingress SDU and the pseudo-wire
                           PDU (e.g. ATM CLP to MPLS EXP) while it is
                           converting the incoming SDU into the PW SDU
                           (e.g. transcoding ATM AAL5 PDU into MPLS PDU)
                           and transports converted PDU across the PWD.
                           The same operation may be repeated in the
                           reverse order at the egress PW if the
                           outgoing interface does not have the same SDU
                           type as the PW.

   Applicability Statement Each PW service will have an Applicability
                           Statement (AS) that describes the particulars
                           of PWs for that service, as well as the
                           degree of faithfulness to that service.

3.3.  Architecture Assumptions

   1) The current design is focused on a point-to-point and same-to-same
      service interface at both end of the PW.  Only network
      interworking will be performed at the edge or the PW.  Support for
      service interworking is for further study.

   2) The initial design of PWE3 is focused on a single homogenous
      administrative PWD (e.g. PW over MPLS or PW over IP etc. ONLY).
      Interworking between different pseudo-wire types and the support
      of inter-domain PWs are for further study.

Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   3) The design of PW will not perfectly emulate the characteristics of
      the native service.  It shall be dependent on both the emulated
      service, as well as on the network implementation.  An AS shall be
      created for each service to describe the degree of faithfulness of
      a PW to the native service.

   4) Only the permanent emulated circuit type (e.g. PVC/PVP) is
      considered initially.  The switched emulated circuit type (e.g.
      SVC/SVP) will be for further study.

   5) The creation and placement of the tunnel to support the PW is not
      within the scope.

   6) The current PW encapsulation approach considerations are focused
      on IPv4, IPv6, L2TP, GRE and MPLS.  Other encapsulation approach
      is for further study.

   7) Current PW service applications are focused on Ethernet (i.e.
      Ethernet II (DIX), 802.3 "raw", Ethernet 802.2, Ethernet SNAP,
      802.3ac VLAN), Frame Relay, ATM, TDM (e.g. DS1, DS3, T1, SONET
      etc.) and MPLS.

   8) Within the single administrative PWD, the design of the PW assumes
      the inheritance of the security mechanism that has been applied to
      the emulated services.  No PW specific security mechanism will be
      specified.

3.4.  Comparison of Relevant Applications

   When considering PWs as a means of providing a service, the following
   questions must be asked:

   - Preservation of Order - Does the application require in-order
     delivery of data?

   - Preservation of Timing - Does the application require fine-grain
     preservation of timing?

   - Natural Delineation - What is the "natural" boundary for
     delineation of data for encapsulation?

   - Packet Size - Are the encapsulated packets variable or fixed in
     size?

   - Data Rate - Is the data rate presented at the interface fixed or
     variable?

   Figure 2 below shows a summary of the applications relevant to pseudo
   wire transport, along with a comparison of their attributes.

4.  Layer 1 (Circuit) Applications

   For these applications the entire bit stream needs to be transported
   to the far end.  As with SONET transport or ATM CES, the physical
   layer coding is terminated and re-generated on the far end.  In
   addition, framing may be terminated and regenerated, depending on the
   application.

   Figure 3 below shows a pair of T1s being carried over a TDM/SONET
   network.  The node marked "M" is an M13 multiplexer, while the nodes
   marked "S" are SONET Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs).

4.2.  Operational Considerations

4.2.1.  Transparency

   Circuits such as T1/E1/T3/E3 lines need a greater degree of
   transparency than Layer 2 services.  These circuits may be carrying
   the services described in the section on Layer 2 services, but in the
   Layer 1 scenario the higher layer application is irrelevant and is
   ignored.  In general, these are "bits in, bits out" applications.

   In this application a circuit or bit stream is encapsulated in fixed-
   size frames that are sent at a fixed rate.  The emulated stream must
   be delivered in a reliable and predictable fashion to the far end.
   Absolute delay and delay variation (also called jitter or wander)
   must be minimized.

   This encapsulation of TDM data must be transparent.  The emulated
   circuit could be carrying one or more types of data (ATM, Frame
   Relay, TCP/IP, etc.), voice traffic, video or anything else.  The
   data is not interpreted; it is simply transported.

4.2.2.  Framed Versus Unframed Mode For TDM Circuits

   As discussed in [ATMCES], emulation of a T1, E1 or other circuit can
   be done in a framed mode or in an unframed mode.  Framed mode
   requires the use of a framer to generate the outgoing framing
   pattern.  More importantly, it is needed to detect a LOS condition or
   reception of an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).  A framer is also
   needed to generate and terminate the Facility Data Link (FDL)
   overhead channel used for communication of loopback commands and
   performance reports.  The capabilities described in the rest of this
   section (except for LOS) are predicated on the presence of a framer.

Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

4.2.3.  Fractional T1/E1

   A fractional T1 or E1 is composed of a number of concatenated DS0s
   and is sometimes referred to as NxDS0.  It may be emulated by
   replicating the contents of the relevant DS0s at the other end of the
   tunnel.  The value of the other timeslots and/or framing are
   irrelevant and are not transported in leased line application.  Even
   though the framing is not transported, a framer is still needed to
   delineate the timeslots for encapsulation.

4.2.4.  Loopbacks

   It is desirable for a PWE node to process loopback messages as
   defined in [T1.403].  This would allow for isolation of faults in a
   network.  It also facilitates the certification of equipment for
   operation in a carrier's network.

   There are also inband loopbacks that are used for voice equipment.
   These are falling out of favor due to their incompatibility with data
   services.  A PWE device that implements inband loopbacks must have
   the capability to disable them.

4.2.5.  Performance Processing

   [T1.403] defines a Network Performance Report Message (NPRM) that
   carry periodic reports on the performance of the link.  It is
   desirable for a PWE node to generate these messages, as they are
   frequently used for surveillance and trouble-shooting.

4.2.6.  LOS/LOF/AIS/RAI

   Figure 5 shows an example for the generation of AIS and RAI.

            <-- Upstream   Downstream -->

                  LOS +-----+ AIS
         ------X----->|\   /|--------->
                      | \ / |
                      | / \ |

             RAI+Data +-----+ Data

                    Figure 5: Generation of AIS and RAI

   A TDM multiplexer, switch or other path-terminating device must
   respond to an LOS (Loss of Signal), LOF (Loss of Frame) or AIS (Alarm
   Indication Signal) condition (collectively known as "red alarms") by:

   - Generating AIS in the "downstream" direction i.e. the same
     direction in which the LOS was detected.  AIS is conveyed by
     sending a certain pattern in the data stream.


Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 16] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   - Generating RAI (Remote Alarm Indication, also known as a "Yellow
     Alarm") in the "upstream" direction i.e. in the other direction.
     RAI is conveyed by sending a certain pattern in the framing.  Note
     that RAI does not interfere with or suppress the payload data.

   Bandwidth can be saved by suppressing the AIS signal in the emulated
   stream and sending instead an indication in the control overhead.
   This also applies to a received AIS signal.  [MALIS] discusses the
   propagation of AIS using the pointer bits in the TDM control word.

   A device emulating TDM circuit must either replicate the AIS
   indication or indicate this condition in the control overhead.

4.2.7.  SONET/SDH STS Unequipped

   The "STS Unequipped" indication may be treated in a fashion similar
   to that for LOS/AIS.  Bandwidth can be saved by suppressing the
   payload in the emulated stream and sending instead an indication in
   the control overhead.

4.3.  Encapsulations

4.3.1.  Criteria

   Encapsulation options for TDM services may be compared on the
   following criteria.

   - Timing - TDM services are very sensitive to timing and timing
     variations ("jitter").  The encapsulation may need to provide
     additional information to help convey timing.

   - Line Signals - The encapsulation should provide a means to convey
     signals such as AIS and line conditions such as LOF.

   - The encapsulation should minimize overhead.

4.3.2.  SONET Encapsulation

4.3.2.1.  SPE

   The format of the SPE (Synchronous Payload Envelope) for SONET is
   defined in [GR253].  This mapping is used in [MALIS] as the basis for
   the encapsulation format.  The advantages of this approach include:

   - It is defined for multiples of 50.112 Mpbs.

   - The structures and methods for synchronization are well defined.

   - The line overhead is suppressed.

   - The SPE can be extracted from the packet and fed into a SONET
     framer.  This facilitates interworking with SONET systems, as shown
     in Figure 4.

   The disadvantages include:

   - There is no support for rates below STS-1.

   - There is no support for rates other than multiples of 50.112 Mbps.

4.3.2.2.  Section/Line

   This is similar to an SPE, but the section and line overhead are
   preserved.  The advantages of this approach include:

   - It is completely transparent.  Any compatibility issues go away.

   - The interface equipment is very simple because no framer is
     required.  The output of an optical transceiver can be fed directly
     into the packet generation function.



Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 18] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   The disadvantages include:

   - In SONET, the user data is carried in the SPE and/or VTs, which are
     path functions.  By analogy, an emulation device should act like
     SONET gear that terminates a section or path.  Transporting the
     section or path overhead seems to violate the spirit of the SONET
     path/line/section model.

4.3.2.3.  VT

   SONET VT mapping into an SPE is defined for T1, E1, E3 and T3.  An
   example of VT1.5 mapping is shown in Figure 6 below, reproduced from
   [GR253].

   The advantages of this approach include:

   - This mapping is well defined.

   - Commercial silicon is available to implement this function.

   - This mapping is fairly efficient.  It requires 27 bytes per VT1.5,
     which is an overhead of about 10%.

   The disadvantages include:

   - This mapping is inefficient for transport of a few circuits.  The
     whole SPE must be sent, regardless of how many circuits are

     provisioned.

4.3.3.  ATM AAL1 Encapsulation

   ATM AAL1/2 is the mapping defined in [I.363.1] and [I.363.2].  It is
   used in [ANAVI] as the basis for the encapsulation.  The advantages
   of this approach include:

   - ATM AAL1 is defined for T1, E1, E3 and T3.

   - ATM cells are fairly small.  This allows for a low capture delay
     and low queuing delay.

   - ATM cells include SRTS timing information.

   The disadvantages include:

   - There is no definition for rates higher than T3.  This means that a
     different encapsulation format would have to be used for STS-1 and
     higher rates.

   - There are 5 bytes of overhead for each 48 bytes of payload.  This
     can be overcome by removing the header at one end of the link and
     restoring it at the other.

   - Telcordia asserts that its U.S. Patent No 5,260,978 for Synchronous

5.2.  Ethernet

5.2.1.  Reference Model Scope

   PW transport of Ethernet operates as a point-to-point trunking
   transport in a non-shared medium.  The Ethernet interface can operate
   in a half-duplex or full-duplex mode.  Control functions such as IEEE
   802.3 Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
   (CSMA/CD)[802.3] and IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree [802.1D] are not
   applicable nor within the scope of PWs.  However, the PW shall
   conform to the service definitions as defined in IEEE 802.1P,Q
   [802.1Q], as required.  Also, it shall support all Ethernet framing
   i.e. Ethernet Frame and IEEE 802.3x including IEEE 802.3ac VLAN
   Tagging [802.3ac] as well as Jumbo Frame.

5.2.2.  Operational Considerations

5.2.2.1.  Operational Modes

   The design of the Ethernet PW must consider the support of the two
   operational modes in this framework:

   Both modes shall be supported for all Ethernet interfaces, i.e. from
   10 Mbps to 10,000 Mbps, and the design of the Ethernet PW functions
   shall be agnostic to the Ethernet's link capacity.

   Both modes shall support the transparent transport of the address
   resolution protocols, i.e. ARP, InverseARP, proxy ARP and Ethernet-
   based control protocol (e.g. Generic Attribute Registration Protocol
   (GARP), GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP) etc.).

   - Ethernet Trunking - In this mode, the trunking access pays
     attention only to the MAC header's port information or other MAC
     header information e.g. MAC address, protocol type etc.  The
     processing rules, e.g. classification, filtering, shall be based on
     configurable policy.

   - Virtual LAN (VLAN) Transport - In this mode, a link can carry the
     traffic of multiple VLANs through the tagging scheme as specified
     in [802.1Q].  The Ethernet PW shall carry multiple VLANs traffic
     and can extend VLANs across the PWD.  Each frame received at the
     trunking access associated with a particular VLAN indicated by the
     given VLAN_ID.  If the received frame is tagged with a NULL
     VLAN_ID, it will be associated with the VLAN equal to the Port's
     default VLAN.  At frame transmission, all frames that are sent in
     this mode shall be tagged except for those assigned for the default
     VLAN.

     The PWE may provide translation of the VLAN_ID in order to
     facilitate deployment.  Note that this does not increase the
     VLAN_ID space, so it has no effect on scalability.

5.2.2.2.  Quality Of Service Support Considerations

   The Ethernet AS shall describe the faithfulness of the PW with
   respect to these attributes described in IEEE 802.1p [802.1Q].

   - Service Availability - Service availability is measured as ratio
     between MAC service is unavailable and available.

   - Frame Loss - The MAC service does not provide guarantees delivery
     of service data units.  However, the Ethernet PW system should
     consider monitoring frame loss.

   - Frame Misorder - The MAC service does not permit reordering frames
     within the same user-priority for a source and destination address
     pair.

   - Frame Duplication - The MAC service does not permit duplicating
     frames.

   - Transit Delay Performance - IEEE 802.1p [802.1Q] defines frame
     transit delay is the elapsed time between an MA_UNITDATA.request
     and corresponding MA_UNITDATA.indication on a successful transfer.

   - Undetected Frame Error Rate - By using the Frame Checksum (FCS)
     calculation for each frame, the undetected frame error rate should
     be low.

   - Maximum Service Data Unit Size - The maximum service data unit size
     is dependent on the access media used.  In general, it is the
     lowest common denominator of the two adjacent Ethernet interface.

   - Priority Tags and Traffic Classes - IEEE 802.1p defines eight
     traffic classes (priority).  These are ignored by the PWE.

5.3.  Frame Relay

5.3.1.  Reference Model

   Frame Relay service offerings often have a different physical format
   and speed at each end of the link.  For example, a hub and spoke
   deployment of Frame Relay might provide fractional T1 access at the
   spokes and a clear channel T3 to the hub.  The Virtual Circuits (VCs)
   are aggregated by switches in the Frame Relay network.  This is shown
   in figure 9 below, where the Frame Relay switches are marked with an
   "F".

5.3.2.  Operational Considerations

   Frame Relay provides a connection-oriented circuit-based transport.
   There are two types of virtual circuits supported in Frame Relay:
   Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits
   (SVCs).  The following sections describe the considerations to
   support the operation of Frame Relay over the PW.

5.3.2.1.  Frame Sequence

   The PW must deliver frames in the proper sequence.

5.3.2.2.  Frame Size

   In general, the maximum frame size for Frame Relay is 1600 bytes per
   [FRF.1.2].  This can be made larger in some implementations.  If the
   MTU of the PW is less than (1600 bytes - size of PW headers), a
   fragmentation and reassembly mechanism may be needed.

5.3.2.3.  End-to-end Transport Characteristics

   [FRF.5] and [FRF.13] define a set of traffic parameters to support
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  The design of the PW should
   preserve these end-to-end transport characteristics.

5.3.2.4.  Connection Management and Congestion Control

   Each Frame Relay header contains some connection management
   information, including

   - a command/response (CR) bit

   - a discard eligibility (DE) bit

   - a connection ID (DLCI)

   - an address extension indicator (EA)

   - Forward/Backward Congestion Notification (FECN/BECN).

   All of this information is vital to the integrity of the Frame Relay
   circuit.  The Frame Relay PW AS shall define an efficient but
   optimized approach to transport such information across the PWD.

5.3.2.5.  Link Management Support

   Frame Delay defines a set of link management functions for PVC Status
   Management as specified in [T1.617D] and [Q.933A].  Link Management
   runs on a dedicated PVC; therefore, its operation does not impact
   actual user data.  The management functions include:



Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 26] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   - a heartbeat exchange that verifies that the link is operational

   - a report regarding the status of one or more individual DLCIs

   For some networks, such as the one shown in Figure 11, this link
   management is the only means to verify the end-to-end integrity of
   the Frame Relay virtual circuit.  The PWE may required to emulate
   such functions.  These functions will be transparent to the
   underlying network.

   Another important consideration is that there should be some
   coordination between the PW's link status and the associated Frame
   Relay VCs.  For example, it might be necessary to tear down the VCs
   in the presence of a network fault.

5.3.2.6.  DLCI Association

   There are two scopes of DLCI addressing that have been defined by
   ANSI and ITU-T: Local and Global DLCIs.

   - Local DLCI addressing means that DLCI numbers are only significant
     at one end of a Frame Relay virtual circuit at the local interface.

   - Global DLCI addressing is an extension to PVC status management
     that allows a DLCI number to have universal significance.  A global
     DLCI identifies the same VC at both ends across the network.

   In the case when the DLCI is locally significant, the management of
   the PWD must provide a mechanism to coordinate the DLCIs at the two
   ends of the PW.  The association can be done via signaling or
   configuration.

5.3.2.7.  Multiplexing VCs over PWs

   To preserve PW tunnel space and to enhance scalability of PWs, it
   would be very valuable to allow one or more VCs to be multiplexed
   onto the same PW.  One scenario might be to associate an entire Frame
   Relay logical interface to a PW.  Another possibility is that the
   assignment of VCs to the PW could be done via signaling or
   management.

   If such multiplexing approach is used, the earlier discussion related
   to the packet sequencing, end-to-end transport characteristic, SLA
   preservation and link status management, shall be addressed with the
   same considerations.

5.3.2.8.  Signaling Transparency

   Since Frame Relay supports SVCs, the PWE may need to support
   signaling interworking at the service access for Frame Relay.
   InverseARP frames should be passed on without interpretation.  In
   either case, these frames shall be transparent to the underlying

Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 27] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   transport.

5.3.2.9.  Soft PVC Support

   One type of connection service that is provided by Frame Relay
   networks is called the Soft PVC (SPVC).  The SPVC may be considered
   as three parts: two peer-to-peer PVCs at each end of the edge, and a
   SPVC between them.  Figure 12 shows the SPVC interconnection example.

       +---+        +---+       +---+       +---+      +---+
       | E |========| C |:::::::| C |:::::::| C |======| E |
       +---+        +---+       +---+       +---+      +---+

       Where:
          "E" is the edge switch
          "C" is the core switch
          "=" is the permanent connection
          ":" is the switched connection

         Figure 12: Example of an SPVC Over a Frame Relay Network

   The creation of the SPVC within the core is triggered by detecting
   the existence of the PVCs at the edges.  This detection is done
   either by network management or by some proprietary signaling.

   Now consider the case where the Frame Relay Network is replaced by an
   PW network as shown in the Figure 10.  The SPVC connection within the
   core is replaced by the PW.  The behavior of the ingress and egress
   edges of the IP core should still behave in the same way towards the
   edge of the two Frame Relay switches at each end.

5.4.  ATM

5.4.1.  Reference Model

   As far as PWs are concerned, ATM is very similar to Frame Relay.  We
   will use the same reference network (Figure 9) for ATM as we did for
   Frame Relay.  Of course, the Frame Relay switches would be ATM
   switches instead.  Likewise, the PWE networks shown in Figures 10 and
   11 are applicable to ATM.

5.4.2.  Operational Considerations

   Like Frame Relay, ATM provides connection-oriented circuit-based
   transport.  There are two types of virtual circuit supported in ATM:
   PVC and SVC.  In addition to virtual circuit connections (VCCs), ATM
   also supports virtual path connections (VPCs).  There are also
   permanent virtual paths (PVPs) and switched virtual paths (SVPs).

   ATM transports data in fixed size (53 byte) frames called "cells".
   Higher layer frames are adapted to these fixed size cells via ATM
   Adaptation Layers (e.g. AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5) and SAR.  Different
   types of AALs have different cell header formats, and the cells may
   contain signaling information.

   The following sections describe the set of considerations for PW
   support of ATM.

5.4.2.1.  Cell Sequence

   The PW must deliver frames in the proper sequence.

5.4.2.2.  End-to-end Transport Characteristics

   ITU-T [I.356] and ATM Forum [TM4.0] defines a set of traffic and QoS
   parameters.  The design of the PW shall be capable of maintaining the
   end-to-end transport characteristic for such virtual circuit.

5.4.2.3.  ATM SLA

   ITU-T [I.371] defines performance targets for managing ATM traffic
   and congestion control.  These target may be used by some service
   providers to define their ATM SLAs.  The AS for ATM PWs should
   specify how SLA transparency will be achieved.

5.4.2.4.  Connection Management and Congestion Control

   The ATM header contains some connection management and congestion
   control information, as defined in [I.371]:

   - Cell Loss priority (CLP)

Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   - Connection Identifier (VPI/VCI)

   - Payload Type Identifier (PTI) - distinguishes between an OAM
     (Operations, Administration and Management) cell and a user cell

   - Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI)

   All of these fields are vital to the integrity of the ATM circuit.
   The ATM PW AS shall define an efficient but optimized approach to
   transport such information across the PWD.

5.4.2.5.  OAM and Link Management Support

   ATM [I.610] defines a set of OAM functions.  Likewise, [ILMI] defines
   a Link Management protocol to manage the ATM link, VCCs and VPCs.
   ILMI Link Management runs on a dedicated PVC; its operation does not
   impact actual user data.  The management function is designed for a
   "heartbeat" exchange that verifies that the link is operational.  It
   also provides a means to detect mis-configuration.

   For some networks, such as the one shown in Figure 11, this link
   management is the only means to verify the end-to-end integrity of
   the ATM virtual circuit.  The PWE may required to emulate such
   functions.  These functions will be transparent to the underlying
   network.

   OAM is often enabled to support important or real-time intensive
   traffic.  OAM operation differs between VCCs and VPCs.  In the case
   of VCC, the OAM cell is sent along the same VC as the user cells.  In
   the case of VPC, the OAM cell is sent over a dedicated VC within the
   VPC.

   OAM emulation shall be limited at the edge of the PW only, and the
   entire operation shall be transparent within the core.

   Another important consideration is that there should be some
   coordination between the PW's link status and the associated ATM VCs.
   For example, it might be necessary to tear down the ATM VCs in the
   presence of a network fault.

5.4.2.6.  VC Associations

   Each ATM connection ID has only local significance in the network.
   This local significance means that each ATM connection identifier
   (VPI and/or VCI) is only significant at local ATM interface, and is
   independent from the ID at the other end of the network.  The
   management of the PWD must provide a mechanism to coordinate the IDs
   at the two ends of the PW.  The association can be done via signaling
   or configuration.

5.4.2.7.  Multiplexing ATM VCs over PWs

   See the discussion in the "Multiplexing VCs over PWs" sub-section of
   the previous "Frame Relay" section of this document.

5.4.2.8.  ATM Signaling Transparency

   See the discussion in the "Signaling Transparency" sub-section of the
   previous "Frame Relay" section of this document.

5.4.2.9.  Soft PVC Support

   See the discussion and figures in the "Soft PVC Support" sub-section
   of the previous "Frame Relay" section of this document.

5.4.2.10.  Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR)

   The bandwidth overhead of the ATM cell is about 10% (= 5 overhead
   bytes out of 53 bytes total).  For AAL5 traffic [I.363.5], it may be
   more efficient in terms of bandwidth to transport the re-assembled
   AAL5 frames instead of the individual ATM cells.  This would involve
   some cost in terms of a SAR operation at each end of the PW.  In some
   cases, especially if OAM is required to be supported over the PW, the
   PW may have no choice but to transport the ATM traffic in cell
   format.

   Whether the ATM traffic is transported in a frame or cell format, it
   is the responsibility of the PWE to emulate the OAM functions to the
   adjacent ATM interface at each end.

6.  Timing

   In the recent Ken Burns Jazz television series, it was said of Louis
   Armstrong that he was very economical with his notes, but that the
   timing of those notes was everything.  The timing of the
   reconstructed bit stream is similarly important.  This section
   describes the various approaches to this problem.  A summary is also
   provided at the end of the section.

6.1.  Reference Model

   Consider the example network shown in Figure 13.


             +----------+                +----------+
             |   PWE1   |                |   PWE2   |
             |          |                |          |
       +--+  |  -----+  |   +--+   +--+  |  -----+  |  +--+
       |E1|=====>FIFO|:::::>|S1|::>|S2|:::::>FIFO|====>|E2|
       +--+  |  -----+  |   +--+   +--+  |  -----+  |  +--+
             |  ^    ^  |                |  ^   ^   |
             |  |    |  |<-------+------>|  |   |   |
             |  A    B  |        |       |  C   D   |
             +----------+        E       +----------+


       Where:
          "En" is the TDM edge device
          "PWEn" is the PWE adaptation device
          "Sn" is a core switch
          "A" - "E" are clocks
          "=" is the T1 Bit Stream
          ":" is the switched connection

               Figure 13: Timing Recovery Reference Diagram

   A jitter correction buffer at the receive can handle short-term
   differences between these two clocks, but over time any absolute
   difference is going to cause this buffer to overflow or underflow.

   Bits are clocked into a FIFO in PWE1 according to clock A, which is
   derived from the clock used at E1.  The bits are packed into frames
   and clocked out according to clock B, which is the same as clock B.
   Clock B could differ from A, as long as there is an indication of the
   number of bits contained in the PDU.

   The frames arrive at switch S1, and are clocked out according to the
   internal oscillator on the output interface of switch S1.  The frames
   will depart at the same average rate at which they arrived, but the
   instantaneous bit rate will be different on each side of S1.  Note
   that there could be short-term variations due to congestion, but S1
   can't experience long-term congestion with respect to the frames

Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 32] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   carrying emulated data, or the service won't work.

   The frames travel on to switch S2, which again forwards them.  Note
   that switch S2 introduces yet another clock, which it uses to
   transmit the packets toward PWE2.  Again the average rate is
   preserved, but the instantaneous rate will vary.

   The frames arrive at PWE2 and are clocked into the FIFO when they
   arrive (using clock C).  Note that clock C will have the same average
   frequency as B, but will have short-term variations.  The bits are
   clocked out of the FIFO according to clock D.

6.2.  Recreating the Timing

   The big question is: where does clock D in Figure 13 come from?
   There are 5 possibilities, and these are detailed in the following
   sections.

   1) Clock D is the same as clock A, and is delivered by clock E, which
      is an "External Timing" source, as described below.

   2) If the switches S1 and S2 were synchronous, and SONET-style
      pointers were used, then Clock D could be derived from Clock C and
      the pointers.  This is described in the "SONET Pointer
      Justification" section below.

   3) Clock D is derived from the average rate of Clock C.  This is the
      "Adaptive Timing" scenario described in a subsequent section.

   4) Clock D is derived from a combination of the local oscillator at
      PWE2 and received RTP or SRTS timestamps.  This is described in
      the "RTP" and "Differential (SRTS)" sections below.

6.3.  External Timing

   The simplest method for communicating timing from one end of a system
   to the other is an external timing source.  This external timing
   source is normally a T1 or E1.  Its 8 KHz frame rate is extracted and
   used to directly clock the reconstructed data streams, or as an input
   to a phase-locked loop to synthesize the desired clock.  The drawback
   to this method is that a common external clock is not commonly
   available in a data network or in a multi-carrier network.

6.4.  SONET Pointer Justification

   SONET defines layers of pointers that allow for the multiplexing and
   transmission of asynchronous signals.  These pointers convey the
   timing of the carried signal with respect to the timing of the
   encapsulating signal.  Each SONET ADM must manipulate these pointers
   to preserve the timing.  This method has the advantage of being well-
   defined and understood.


Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 33] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   One way to apply this method to a packet-based network would be to
   ensure that all of the links on a given path are synchronous.  This
   would be difficult for Gigabit Ethernet or POS links.  Another way
   would be for each router to update the pointers as the packet
   traversed the router.  This would be compute intensive.  A final way
   to use a pointer-based method would be to limit the path to one
   physical hop.

6.5.  Differential (SRTS)

   [ATMCES] describes the SRTS (Synchronous Residual Time Stamp) method:

        The SRTS technique measures the Service Interface input
        clock frequency against a network-wide synchronization
        signal that must be present in the IWF, and sends
        difference signals, called Residual Time Stamps, in the
        AAL1 header to the reassembly IWF. At the output IWF, the
        differences can be combined with the network-wide
        synchronization signal to re-create the input Service
        Interface clock.

   The requirement for a network-wide signal is reasonable in a Telco or
   SONET environment, where such clocks are commonly available.  From an
   equipment implementation standpoint, this method is similar to the
   SONET pointer method, which also uses adjustments that are relative
   to a separate clock (the line rate in the case of SONET).  The
   advantage of a SRTS approach is from a deployment standpoint.  A
   reference clock must be available at both ends, but not at any of the
   intervening routers.

6.6.  Adaptive Timing

   Adaptive timing is used when an external reference is not available.
   [ATMCES] describes adaptive timing as follows:

        The adaptive technique does not require a network-wide
        synchronization signal to regenerate the input Service
        clock at the output IWF.  A variety of techniques could be
        used to implement Adaptive clock recovery.  For example,
        the depth of the reassembly buffer in the output IWF could
        be monitored:

        1.  When the buffer depth is too great or tends to increase
            with time, the frequency of the Service clock could be
            increased to cause the buffer to drain more quickly.

        2.  When the buffer contains fewer than the configured
            number of bits, the Service clock could be slowed to
            cause the buffer to drain less quickly.  Wander may be
            introduced by the Adaptive clock recovery technique if
            there is a low-frequency component to the Cell Delay
            Variation inserted by the ATM network carrying cells
            from the input to output IWF.

        Careful design is required to make adaptive timing work
        well.  The instantaneous buffer depth must be filtered to
        extract the average frequency and to reject the jitter and
        wander.

   Adaptive timing is ideal for many network applications where there is
   no external timing reference available (needed for SRTS), and where
   the packet rate is decoupled from the line rate (as in a routed
   network).

6.7.  RTP

   [RTP] uses an absolute timestamp to play out the bits at the same
   rate that they were received and packetized.  RTCP (RTP Control
   Protocol) provides a means to synchronize the transmit and receive
   clocks.

6.7.1.  RTP Timestamps

   Section 4 of [RTP] defines a timestamp that is either 32-bits or
   64-bits in size:

        Wallclock time (absolute time) is represented using the
        timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which
        is in seconds relative to 0h UTC on 1 January 1900 [NTP].
        The full resolution NTP timestamp is a 64-bit unsigned
        fixed-point number with the integer part in the first 32
        bits and the fractional part in the last 32 bits. In some
        fields where a more compact representation is appropriate,
        only the middle 32 bits are used; that is, the low 16 bits
        of the integer part and the high 16 bits of the fractional
        part.  The high 16 bits of the integer part must be
        determined independently.

   A 32-bit absolute time stamp with a 16-bit fractional part would give
   a 15 us granularity (= 1/65535), which is too coarse for circuit
   emulation.  This means that the 64-bit timestamp must be used, with a
   granularity of 23 ns.

   The transmit timestamps are created according to the internal
   oscillator at PWE1 and interpreted according to the internal
   oscillator at PWE2.  These two oscillators will vary by some amount,
   even if they are very accurate.  The effects of this difference (or
   drift) is considered in the next section.

6.7.2.  Analysis of Clock Drift

   Since the two oscillators will vary or drift over time, the FIFO at
   PWE2 will eventually overflow or underflow, unless this drift is
   corrected.  Figure 14 below shows why this must happen.

     TDM Frame Boundaries |     |     |     |     |     |     |
     PWE1 Wallclock      125   250   375   500   625   750   875
     PWE1 Timestamps      1     2     3     4     5     6     7

     PWE2 Wallclock      125    250    375    500    625  700    825
     PWE2 Offset          0      0      0      0      0    50     50
     PWE2 Timestamps      1      2      3      4      5    6      7
     RTCP Update                                          750

                          Figure 14: Clock Drift


Pate/Xiao/So/White/Kompella Expires Nov. 2001                  [Page 36] 
Internet Draft        draft-pate-pwe3-framework-00          May 18, 2001

   In Figure 14, PWE1 has a clock that is running faster than PWE2.
   Note that this difference is exaggerated in the figure.  PWE1 sends
   out packets according to its clock, with timestamps also derived from
   its clock.  PWE2 uses its clock to decide the appropriate times to
   remove bits from the FIFO.  It is clear that packets will arrive
   faster than they are being removed, and The FIFO at PWE2 will
   eventually overflow.

6.7.3.  RTCP/NTP as a Solution

   One possible solution is to use NTP [NTP] or RTCP [RTP] to coordinate
   the clocks at PWE1 and PWE2.  This is shown in Figure 14 in the row
   marked "RTCP Update" where a value of 750 arrives at PWE2.  This lets
   PWE2 create an appropriate offset to correct its output timing.

   NTP could also be used to ensure that clocks B and D were very close
   in their absolute value.

6.8.  Summary of Timing Recovery Methods

   Figure 15 below shows a summary of the methods for timing recovery.

8.  Management

8.1.  Session Multiplexing

   One way to facilitate scaling is to increase the number of PWs per
   underlying tunnel.  There are two ways to achieve this:

   - For a service like Relay or ATM, all of the VCs on a given port
     could be lumped together.  VCs would not be distinguishable within
     the PWD.

   - Service SDUs could be distinguished within a PW-PDU by port,
     channel or VC identifiers.  This approach would allow for switching
     or grooming in the PWD.
