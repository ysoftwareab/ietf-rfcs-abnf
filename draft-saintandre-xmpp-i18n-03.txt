                  Internationalized Addresses in XMPP
                     draft-saintandre-xmpp-i18n-03

Abstract

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as defined in
   RFC 3920 used stringprep in the preparation and comparison of non-
   ASCII characters within XMPP addresses.  This document explores a
   post-stringprep approach to XMPP addresses.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP I18N                     March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [RFC6120] is a widely-
   deployed technology for real-time communication, commonly used for
   instant messaging (IM) among human users but also for communication
   among automated systems.  XMPP addresses (also called "JabberIDs" or
   JIDs) are of the form <localpart@domainpart/resourcepart>, where the
   localpart and resourcepart are formally optional but quite common
   because they are used to identify clients and other entities on the
   network.  In some sense, XMPP addresses have always been
   internationalized, because the developers of the original Jabber
   open-source project intended that all data sent over the wire would
   consist of UTF-8 encoded Unicode code points.  However, at that time
   (1999) the Jabber developers were quite unsophisticated about
   internationalization, nor could they simply re-use a reliable
   internationalization technology that had been developed by the wider
   Internet community (as they could, for example, by re-using Secure
   Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security for channel encryption);
   this lack of sophistication is evident in the community's first
   attempt at formally defining the format for JabberIDs in early 2002
   [XEP-0029].

   When the first instantiation of the IETF's XMPP WG was formed in late
   2002, IDNA2003 [RFC3490] had not yet been published and stringprep
   [RFC3454] was a new technology.  During its work on [RFC3920], the
   XMPP WG absorbed as best it could the advice of internationalization
   experts regarding appropriate methods for preparing and comparing
   XMPP addresses; however, the participants in the XMPP WG were
   ignorant of internationalization and therefore did not necessarily
   make fully-informed decisions.  As a result of this early work, in
   [RFC3920] the XMPP WG decided to re-use IDNA2003 [RFC3490] and
   Nameprep [RFC3491] for the domainpart of a JID and to define two
   additional stringprep profiles: Nodeprep for the localpart and
   Resourceprep for the resourecepart.

   Since the publication of [RFC3920] in 2004, the Internet community
   has gained more experience with internationalization.  In particular,
   IDNA2003, which is based on stringprep, has been superseded by
   IDNA2008 ([RFC5890], [RFC5891], [RFC5892], [RFC5893], [RFC5894]),
   which does not use stringprep.  This migration away from stringprep
   for internationalized domain names has prompted other "customers" of
   stringprep to consider new approaches to the preparation and
   comparison of internationalized addresses.  As a result, the IETF has
   formed the PRECIS WG as a common forum for seeking solutions to the
   problem statement outlined in [PROBLEM].

   This document has two purposes: (1) provide input to the PRECIS WG
   and (2) help inform the decisions of the XMPP WG regarding

   internationalization of XMPP addresses, eventually leading to
   replacement of [RFC6122].  Note well that so far this document
   present only the author's opinions, and that it does not reflect the
   consensus of the XMPP WG or the PRECIS WG.


2.  Proposed PRECIS String Classes

   Both [PROBLEM] and [FRAMEWORK] propose that it might be valuable to
   think of internationalized addresses in terms of broad "string
   classes".  Application technologies like XMPP could either borrow
   such a string class unchanged or "profile" such a string class with
   modifications.

   This document does not yet make recommendations about borrowing or
   adapting more general string classes, in part because those classes
   are not yet clearly defined.  However, as input to further
   discussion, this document explores four string classes that are used
   in XMPP:

   o  Domain names.  These are defined in IDNA specification and re-used
      in XMPP and other applications.  However, additional guidelines
      might be helpful for applications (or at least for XMPP) to fill
      the gap between what was provided in IDNA2003 (such as
      normalization and various mapping steps) and what is now provided
      in IDNA2008.  For consistency with the next three string classes
      we call these "domaineythings".

   o  Username-like things.  Such a "nameything" is a word or set of
      words that is used to identify or address a network entity such as
      a user, an account, a venue (e.g., a chatroom), an information
      source (e.g., a feed), or a collection of data (e.g., a file).  An
      XMPP localpart is a kind of nameything, but might profile a base
      definition of nameythings developed by the PRECIS WG.

   o  Password-like things.  Such a "wordything" is a sequence of
      letters, numbers, and symbols that is used as a secret for access
      to some resource on a network (e.g., an account or a venue).  In
      XMPP, wordythings are often used by clients to authenticate with
      servers, as provided in various SASL mechanisms.

   o  Free-form things.  Such a "stringything" is a sequence of letters,
      numbers, symbols, spaces, and other code points that is used for
      more expressive purposes in an application protocol.  An XMPP
      resourcepart is a kind of stringything, but might profile a base
      definition of stringythings developed by the PRECIS WG.

   The following subsections discuss these string classes in more

   detail, with reference to the properties described in Section 3 of
   [PROBLEM] (input restrictions, normalization, case mapping, and
   bidirectionality).

2.1.  Domaineythings

   The IDNA2008 protocol is defined in [RFC5890], [RFC5891], [RFC5892],
   [RFC5893], and [RFC5894].  However, IDNA2008 covers a smaller range
   of topics than IDNA2003 [RFC3490].  In particular, normalization and
   mappings are out of scope for IDNA2008 (although one possible
   approach is described informationally in [RFC5895]).  The XMPP WG, or
   even the PRECIS WG, might want to choose a normalization form and a
   set of mappings that would be recommended or required for use on the
   wire, despite the fact that these matters were not specified in a
   normative way for IDNA2008.  This is especially important in modern
   application protocols that communicate using UTF-8-encoded Unicode
   code points instead of 8-bit or 7-bit ASCII (as in older application
   protocols such as [RFC5322]).

2.2.  Nameythings

   Most application technologies need a special class of strings that
   can be used to include or communicate things like usernames, chatroom
   names, file names, and data feed names.  We group such things into a
   bucket called "nameythings".  Ideally, the PRECIS WG would define a
   "nameything" class that could be profiled by various application
   technologies.  We suggest that the base class would have the
   following features:

   o  Control characters (e.g., U+0000 through U+001F) would be
      disallowed.
   o  Space characters (U+0020, along with any code point having a
      GeneralCategory of Zs) would be disallowed.
   o  All other 7-bit ASCII characters (i.e., U+0021 through U+007E)
      would be protocol-valid, even if their Unicode GeneralCategory is
      disallowed by the rules specified below.
   o  As with IDNA2008, any character that has a compatibility
      equivalent would be disallowed.
   o  Uppercase and titlecase code points would be mapped to their
      lowercase equivalents.
   o  The normalization form would be NFD (see below).
   o  Profiles of the base class would be able to exclude specific code
      points that are included in the base.
   o  Profiles of the base class would be able to exclude character
      classes with other properties (e.g., math symbols) that are
      included in the base.

   OPEN ISSUE: Should symbol characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range be

   disallowed?

   OPEN ISSUE: How to handle right-to-left code points?  It might be
   reasonable to simply use the "Bidi Rule" from [RFC5893], however "."
   is allowed in nameythings and the Bidi Rule is probably too complex
   for our purposes because domaineythings have internal structure
   (based around the "." character) whereas nameythings do not.

2.3.  Wordythings

   Many application technologies need a special class of strings that
   can be used to communicate secrets that are typically used as
   passwords or passphrases.  We group such things into a bucket called
   "wordythings".  Ideally, the PRECIS WG would define a "wordything"
   class that could be profiled by various application technologies.  We
   suggest that the base class would have the following features:

   o  Control characters (e.g., U+0000 through U+001F) would be
      disallowed.
   o  Space characters (U+0020, along with any code point having a
      GeneralCategory of Zs) would be disallowed.
   o  All other 7-bit ASCII characters (i.e., U+0021 through U+007E)
      would be protocol-valid, even if their Unicode GeneralCategory is
      disallowed by the rules specified below.
   o  Any character that has a compatibility equivalent would be
      disallowed.
   o  In order to maximize the entropy of passwords and passphrases,
      uppercase and titlecase code points would be protocol-valid and
      would not be mapped to their lowercase equivalents.
   o  The normalization form would be NFD (see below).
   o  Profiles of the base class would be able to exclude specific code
      points that are included in the base.
   o  Profiles of the base class would be able to exclude character
      classes with other properties (e.g., math symbols) that are
      included in the base.

   Although some application protocols use passwords and passphrases
   directly, others re-use technologies that themselves use passwords in
   some deployments (e.g., this is true of XMPP, which re-uses Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer or SASL [RFC4422]).

2.4.  Stringythings

   Some application technologies need a special class of strings that
   can be used in a free-form way.  We group such things into a bucket
   called "stringythings".  Ideally, the PRECIS WG would define a
   "stringything" class that could be profiled by various application
   technologies.  We suggest that the base class would have the

Internet-Draft                  XMPP I18N                     March 2011


   following features:

   o  Control characters (e.g., U+0000 through U+001F) would be
      disallowed.
   o  Space characters (U+0020, along with any code point having a
      GeneralCategory of Zs) would be protocol-valid.
   o  All other 7-bit ASCII characters (i.e., U+0021 through U+007E)
      would be protocol-valid, even if their Unicode GeneralCategory is
      disallowed by the rules specified below.
   o  Characters with compatibility equivalents would be protocol-valid.
   o  Uppercase and titlecase code points would protocol-valid and would
      not be mapped to their lowercase equivalents.
   o  The normalization form would be NFD (see below).
   o  Profiles of the base class would be able to exclude specific code
      points that are included in the base.
   o  Profiles of the base class would be able to exclude character
      classes with other properties (e.g., math symbols) that are
      included in the base.

   OPEN ISSUE: How to handle right-to-left code points?  It might be
   reasonable to simply use the "Bidi Rule" from [RFC5893], however "."
   is allowed in stringythings and the Bidi Rule is probably too complex
   for our purposes because domaineythings have internal structure
   (based around the "." character) whereas stringythings do not.


3.  Normalization

   Following IDNA2003, existing stringprep profiles all use Unicode
   Normalization Form KC (NFKC), which performs canonical decomposition
   and compatibility decomposition, followed by canonical and
   compatibility recomposition (regarding normalization forms, see
   [UAX15]).  This choice made sense in IDNA2003 because the DNS packet
   format has fixed-length labels, and NFKC in effect compresses a
   sequence of characters into the smallest number of bytes possible by
   performing recomposition.  However, experience with some of the
   application protocols that are currently using NFKC has shown that
   recomposition is an expensive operation to perform in application
   servers.  In addition, the application protocols that use stringprep
   all use TCP with security-layer or application-layer compression, so
   fixing the length of strings is much less important.

   What matters most in application protocols is ensuring that network
   entities (such as clients and servers) all communicate a consistent
   string representation over the wire.  For this purpose, Normalization
   Form D (NFD), which simply performs canonical decomposition, provides
   the most efficient approach.  As noted above, we can disallow any
   characters that would require compatibility decomposition, thus

   removing the need for compatibility decomposition and recomposition.
   This is what happened in IDNA2008, enabling IDNA technologies to move
   from NFKC to NFC.  If the same basic approach is taken in the PRECIS
   WG, while at the same time removing the need for recomposition
   entirely (by making code points with compatibility equivalents), NFKC
   (the most complex and therefore most computationally intensive
   normalization form) can be replaced with NFD (the least complex and
   therefore least computationally intensive normalization form).
   Another relevant factor is that NFD(x) = NFD(NFD(x)), which means
   that application servers can be optimized for the case where the
   normalization has already occurred.  In general, using NFD will
   likely result in significant performance improvements within
   application servers.


4.  Subclassing

   The opportunity for subclassing PRECIS string classes opens the
   possibility that different applications technologies will subclass a
   given class in different ways.  For example, imagine that the XMPP
   community defines a detailed subclass of "nameything" that is
   optimized for the comparison of JabberIDs.  However, the email
   community might do the same for email addresses.  At that point, the
   XMPP comparison methods might diverge significantly from the mail
   comparison methods, leading to interoperability problems if a given
   deployment makes use of the same usernames for both JabberIDs and
   email addresses.  The PRECIS WG needs to consider these matters and
   find a productive balance between compatibility within an application
   technology and interoperability across application technologies.


5.  XMPP Use of PRECIS String Classes

5.1.  Localpart

   The localpart of an XMPP address would be redefined as a profile or
   subclass of the PRECIS "nameything" class.  The following additional
   restrictions would apply:

   o  Space characters (U+0020, along with any code point having a
      GeneralCategory of Zs) would be disallowed.
   o  The following Unicode code points would be disallowed: U+0022 ("),
      U+0026 (&), U+0027 ('), U+002F (/), U+003A (:), U+003C (<), U+003E
      (>), U+0040 (@).

   OPEN ISSUE: Should symbol characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range be
   disallowed?

Internet-Draft                  XMPP I18N                     March 2011


5.2.  Resourcepart

   The resourcepart of an XMPP address would be redefined as a profile
   or subclass of the PRECIS "stringything" class, or might even simply
   use the identity subclass of "stringything".


6.  XMPP Migration Issues

   Any move away from Nameprep, Nodeprep, and Resourceprep as they are
   defined today will inevitably introduce the potential for migration
   issues, such as JIDs that were not ambiguous before the migration but
   that become ambiguous after the migration.  These issues need to be
   clearly defined and well understood so that the costs and benefits of
   any change can be properly assessed -- especially if the change might
   have an impact on authentication (e.g., as described in [RFC3920]),
   authorization (e.g., presence subscriptions as described in
   [RFC6121]), access (e.g., joining a chatroom as described in
   [XEP-0045]), identification (e.g., in XMPP URIs or IRIs as described
   in [RFC5122]), and other security-related functions.


7.  XMPP Protocol Slots

   IDNA2008 defined the concept of a "domain name slot", i.e., "a
   protocol element or a function argument or a return value (and so on)
   explicitly designated for carrying a domain name" (Section 2.3.2.6 of
   [RFC5890]).  Similarly, the XMPP community can define the concepts of
   a "JID slot", a "localpart slot", and a "resourcepart slot" (and
   might re-use the concepts of a "nameything slot", "wordything slot",
   and "stringything slot" from PRECIS specifications).  The community
   has yet to determine the full inventory of such slots.  However, the
   following subsections provide a start at such an inventory.

7.1.  JID Slot

   In XMPP systems, JabberIDs can appear in at least the following
   slots:

   o  Core [RFC6120]: the 'from' and 'to' stream attributes; the 'from'
      and 'to' stanza attributes.
   o  IM [RFC6121]: the 'jid' attribute of the roster <item/> element.
   o  Privacy Lists [RFC3921], [XEP-0016]: the 'value' attribute of the
      <item/> element when the value of the 'type' attribute is "jid".
   o  Data Forms [XEP-0004]: the <value/> element when the 'type'
      attribute is "jid-single" or "jid-multi".

   o  Flexible Offline Message Retrieval [XEP-0013]: the 'jid' attribute
      of the <x/> element.
   o  Service Discovery [XEP-0030]: the 'jid' attribute of the <item/>
      element.
   o  Extended Stanza Addressing [XEP-0033]: the 'jid' attribute of the
      <address/> element.
   o  Multi-User Chat [XEP-0045]: the 'actor' child of the <item/>
      element; the 'jid' attribute of the <item/> element; the 'from'
      and 'to' attributes of the <invite/> and <decline/> elements; the
      'jid' attribute of the <destroy/> element.
   o  Bookmarks [XEP-0048]: the 'jid' attribute of the <conference/>
      element.
   o  vCards [XEP-0054]: the <JABBERID/> of the <vCard/> element.
   o  Jabber Search [XEP-0055]: the 'jid' attribute of the <item/>
      element.
   o  Publish-Subscribe [XEP-0060]: the 'jid' attribute of the
      <affiliation/>, <options/>, <subscribe>, <subscription/>, and
      <unsubscribe/> elements; the 'publisher' attribute of the <item/>
      element.
   o  SOCKS5 Bytestreams [XEP-0065]: the 'jid' attribute of the
      <streamhost/> and <streamhost-used/> elements.
   o  Advanced Message Processing [XEP-0079]: the 'from' and 'to'
      attributes of the <amp/> element.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP I18N                     March 2011


   o  In-Band Registration [XEP-0077]: the <username/> element.

7.3.  Resourcepart Slot

   In XMPP systems, resourceparts can appear in at least the following
   slots:

   o  Core [RFC6120]: the <resource/> child of the <bind/> element.
   o  Multi-User Chat [XEP-0045]: the 'nick' attribute of the <item/>
      element.

      <query/> elements.
   o  Publish-Subscribe [XEP-0060]: the 'node' attribute of the
      <address/> element (this might actually be a "stringything slot"
      but typically it is handled as a resourcepart).

7.4.  Wordything Slot

   In XMPP systems, generic "wordythings" can appear in at least the
   following slots:

   o  Multi-User Chat [XEP-0045]: the <password/> child of the
      <destroy/> and <x/> elements.
   o  Bookmarks [XEP-0048]: the 'password' attribute of the
      <conference/> element.
   o  Direct MUC Invitations [XEP-0249]: the 'password' attribute of the

   In XMPP systems, generic "stringythings" can appear in at least the
   following slots:

   o  Flexible Offline Message Retrieval [XEP-0013]: the 'node'
      attribute of the <x/> element.
   o  Extended Stanza Addressing [XEP-0033]: the 'node' attribute of the
      <address/> element.
   o  Publish-Subscribe [XEP-0060]: the 'node' attribute of various XML
      elements.


8.  XMPP Error Handling

   Both the core XMPP specifications and various XMPP extensions might
   need to define more robust error handling.  Although this topic has
   yet to be explored in detail, it is likely that specifications can

Internet-Draft                  XMPP I18N                     March 2011


   more widely use the existing <jid-malformed/> error condition defined
   in [RFC6120].


9.  XMPP User Interface Issues

   [RFC5895] introduces the helpful concept of "the dividing line
   between user interface and protocol" and applies that concept to the
   complexs process of translating the user's (presumed) intentions into
   bits on the wire.  IDNA2003 conflated user interface processing and
   machine-readable protocols, and in many ways XMPP inherited that same
   error.  It would be desirable for XMPP technologies to define a clear
   dividing line between user interface and protocol.  This might mean
   that the XMPP community will need to define recommended mappings that
   are applied to a string before it is considered a JID (or the
   localpart of resourcepart of a JID).


10.  Security Considerations

   The inclusion of non-ASCII characters in XMPP addresses has important
   security implications, such as the ability to mimic characters or
   entire addresses through the inclusion of "confusable characters"
   (see [RFC4690] and [RFC5890]).  These issues are explored at some
   length in [RFC6122].  Other security considerations might apply and
   will be described in a future version of this specification.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines no actions for the IANA.


12.  Acknowledgements

   Special thanks to Joe Hildebrand for extensive discussions about
   internationalization and XMPP.  Many participants in the XMPP WG
   Interim Meeting in February 2011 provided valuable feedback.  Thanks
   also to Jack Erwin, Matt Miller, and Tory Patnoe for additional
