1. Introduction

  A basic service of ALTO is to provide information from network
  service providers to applications, in order to improve network
  efficiency and application performance.  Some applications start to
  or have shown interests to conduct integration with ALTO.  Some
  major ISPs (e.g., China Telecom) are in the process of deploying

  ALTO services in their production networks.  As a result, more ISPs
  start to evaluate key issues in the deployment of ALTO in their
  networks. Thus, a document highlighting some key issues that an ISP
  should consider in the deployment process can be a highly valuable
  reference.

  The objective of this document is to provide such a reference.  The
  document will try to draw on many valuable discussions in the ALTO
  mailing list as well as the predecessor p2pi mailing list.  In
  addition, it will try to draw on the trial experiences of multiple
  ISPs (e.g., [CTTrial,ComcastTrial].

  The deployment of ALTO involves both ISPs and network applications.
  We can identify four major issues in ALTO deployment:

   1. How does an ISP deploy and configure its ALTO servers?
      Specifically, an ALTO Server provides the Network Map and the
      Cost Map. How does an ISP configure these maps?  Where does an
      ISP deploy ALTO servers?

   2. Which application entities fetch ALTO information?

   3. How does an application integrate ALTO information into its
      decision process?

   4. How does an ISP (potentially with collaboration from
      applications) monitor the deployment of ALTO, so that the ISP
      can better understand the status as well as the policy impacts
      of its ALTO deployment?

  This document focuses more on the ISP perspective. Therefore, it
  focuses more on the first and the fourth issues.  There are
  additional deployment documents in the ALTO working group that
  focus more on the second issue and the third issue. Our document
  is complementary to these other documents.

2. ALTO Service Configuration

2.1. Optimization Area

  An ISP deploys ALTO service to optimize traffic for a given network
  area.  We define a network area for which traffic need be optimized
  using the ALTO service as an optimization area. Optimization area
  definition is very important in ALTO service deployment, because
  there are multiply types of network and topology infrastructure in
  real Internet.

  Traditional, an optimization area can be an access network, a MAN,
  or a larger network consisting of both access works and MANs.  An

Internet-Draft      ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring    March 2011


  ISP with a relatively small network can define a single
  optimization area and deploy an ALTO server for the area.

  An ISP with a larger network may partition its network into
  multiple optimization areas.  Each optimization area may include
  one or more MANs.  Alternatively, the ISP may choose to use a large
  optimization area and distribute a group of ALTO servers.

  Besides the geographic point of view we can define the different
  Optimization Areas through the type of network too. The networks
  based on FTTx, ADSL,wifi and 3G or even 2G wireless technology has
  different traffic model and infrastructure. ALTO service should
  represent the difference between these networks.

2.2. Network and Cost Map Configuration

  Key components for an ISP to configure when it deploys its ALTO
  service are the Network Map and Cost Map. They have impacts on
  both the load and the effectiveness of the service.

2.2.1. Network Map and PID

  Different ISPs use different technologies to build their
  infrastructures.  Some ISPs have only a relatively small network,
  focusing mainly on access.  On the other hand, some large ISPs have
  access networks, MANs, and a Core network.  There are tradeoffs
  when a large ISP defines its Network Map. If the partition of the
  network in the Network Map is too fine-grained, it may lead to
  higher complexity and overhead.  On the other hand, a too coarse-
  grained Network Map may lead to suboptimal optimization.

  Specifically, first consider an access network, say an ADSL or
  Ethernet based access network.  A BAS server may be deployed to
  provide access service for its subscribers.  Because all
  subscribers' traffic must be transmitted through the BAS server,
  one technique is to identify each such access network by one PID.
  It is generally unnecessary to further divide such access networks.
  On the other hand, it can be beneficial to combine several such
  access networks into a single PID.

  A MAN usually consists of several access networks.  The MANs are
  connected to a core network, whose network bandwidth resource may
  be costly for some networks.  Thus, the ISP can define one or
  several MANS as one PID.  It is also possible that the ISP deploys
  ALTO independently in some MANs.

2.2.2. Cost Map

  In ALTO protocol, cost map configuration can be used to tune the
  traffic model. For example, to one optimization area of mobile
  network, the wireless uplink is very limited in data transmission,
  because of current mobile operators' configuration in 3G network.
  So the cost to this optimization area can be higher, thus this area
  can provide less traffic to other optimization areas.

  In real ALTO service deployment, ISPs can plan its cost map
  according to its optimization requirement and network conditions.

2.3. Endpoint Service Configuration

  In ALTO protocol, Endpoint Property Service allows ALTO clients to
  look up properties for individual endpoints. The endpoint cost
  service allows an ALTO service to return either numerical costs or
  ordinal costs (ranking) directly amongst Endpoints. Using these
  services, ISP can provide more detail connectivity and cost
  information of endpoint to upper application. For example in P2P
  service, ISP can use this service to provide the connectivity type
  of P2P clients to upper P2P operator.

  Also in real deployment of ISP, different networks have different
  connectivity characters, for example, ADSL network has asymmetrical
  uplink and downlink bandwidth, as well as mobile network always
  have small bandwidth compare to fixed network. Because all clients
  access to Internet through ISPs, so ISPs have detail information of
  each client's access character. Thus ISP can provide these
  information to service operator.

  In ALTO deployment of ISPs, there are some properties which are
  necessary to the endpoint property service. P2P or CDN application
  can benefit from that. We suggest to add the network type,
  uplinkbandwidth and downlinkbandwidth into endpoint property
  service .One example of these properties protocol usage is given
  below.

3. ALTO Deployment Monitoring

  In addition to providing configuration, an ISP providing ALTO may
  want to deploy a monitoring infrastructure to assess the benefits
  of ALTO and adjust its ALTO configuration.

  To construct an effective monitoring infrastructure, the ISP should
  (1) define the performance metrics to be monitored; (2) and
  identify and deploy devices to collect data to compute the
  performance metrics.  We discuss both below.

3.1. Monitoring Metrics

  The monitoring of some performance metrics can be dependent on
  specific applications, and ALTO can be applied to multiple
  applications such as P2P and CDN.  We focus on P2P applications.

3.1.1. Network Metrics

  An ISP may monitor the impacts of ALTO on its network through a set
  of performance metrics.  We enumerate some key metrics.  We define
  the term domain as one or many groups of Endpoints.  That is, one
  domain includes one PID or some PIDs.  Endpoints and PID are
  defined in "draft-ietf-alto-protocol-05".

  A specific set of metrics measuring the impacts of ALTO on networks
  can include the following:

      o  Inter-domain ALTO-Integrated Application Traffic (Network
         metric): This metric includes total cross domain traffic
         generated by applications that utilize ALTO guidance.  This

Internet-Draft      ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring    March 2011


         metric evaluates the impacts of ALTO on the inbound and
         outbound traffic of a domain.

      o  Total Inter-domain Traffic (Network metric): This is
         similar to the preceding but focuses on all of the traffic,
         ALTO aware or not.  One possibility is that some of the
         reduction of interdomain traffic by ALTO aware applications
         may This metric is always used with the preceding and the
         following metrics.

      o  Intra-domain ALTO-Integrated Application Traffic (Network
         metric).

      o  Network hop count (Network metric): This metric provides
         the average number of hops that traffic traverses inside a
         domain. ALTO may reduce not only traffic volume but also the
         hops.  The metric can also indirectly reflect some
         application performance (e.g., latency).

3.1.2. Application Metrics

  Each specific application can have its specific set of performance
  metrics.  We give one example for file sharing.

      o  Application download rate (Application metric): This metric
         measures application performance directly.  Download means
         inbound traffic to one user.  Global average means the
         average value of all users' download rates in one or more
         domains.

      o  Application Client type audit(Application metric): this
         metric gives the audit of client types in ALTO service. The
         current types include fixed network client and mobile
         network client.

3.2. Monitoring Data Sources

  The preceding metrics are derived from data sources.  We identify
  four data sources.

3.2.1. Application Log Server

  Many P2P applications deploy Log Servers to collect data.

3.2.2. P2P Clients

  Some P2P applications may not have Log Servers.  When available,
  P2P client logs can provide data.

Internet-Draft      ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring    March 2011


3.2.3. OAM

  Many ISPs deploy OAM systems to monitor IP layer traffic.  An OAM
  provides traffic monitoring of every network device in its
  management area.  It provides data such as link physical bandwidth
  and traffic volumes.

3.3. Application/ISP Monitoring Integration

3.3.1. Structure

  As discussed in the preceding section, some data sources are from
  ISP while some others are from application.  When there is a
  collaboration agreement between the ISP and an application, there
  can be an integrated monitoring system as shown in the figure
  below.  In particular, an application developer may deploy Monitor
  Clients to communicate with Monitor Server of the ISP to transmit
  raw data from the Log Server or P2P clients of the application to
  the ISP.
