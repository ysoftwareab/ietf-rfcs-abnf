Internet-Draft      SAVA Multihome Problem Statement           June 2007


Abstract

   This document specifies the problems for the SAVA (Source Address
   Verification Architecture) regarding to multihoming issue.  The
   packets coming from the multihoming location may have two different
   AS numbers, this will be an issue for inter-domain source address
   verification.

Internet-Draft      SAVA Multihome Problem Statement           June 2007


1.  Introduction

   In the current SAVA BOF proposal[SAVA-FRAMEWORK], the architecture is
   categorized into three type of defense: access network, intra-domain,
   and inter-domain.  When a host is located in multihoming scenario,
   the packet coming from this host may go through two different network
   access providers.  In this case, this host may have two AS numbers.
   But current SAVA only assume the packet coming from only one AS
   number.

   This document defines a problem with inter-domain SAVA about
   multihoming issue.

2.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terminology used
   in [RFC1654], [RFC2827].  In addition, the following terms are
   defined:

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

3.  Problem statement about Multihoming in the Inter-domain SAVA

   A multihoming host in SAVA network architecture may has two AS
   numbers which may conflict with SAVA inter-domain solution.

   In this network architecture, as the below Figure 1, the host A have
   two network access connnections: ISP 1 which has network prefix
   a.b.c.0/24 and ISP 2 which has network prefix d.e.f.0/24, if host A
   follow the case of load balance which could enhance multihoming
   service. the packet from host A could go through left side router
   which is SAVA supported and the other router which is SAVA supported
   too, but the top BGP router would find that packet will have two
   types of AS number label coming from the same network address host A.
   SAVA may discard the packet which come late than previous and think
   it is a kind of malicious attack

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification operates in the security constraints and
   requirements of about some events and provides the same level of
   security for all three nodes.
