1  Introduction

   This document describes a convention for using the Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS] to more than one content.  The content
   collection content type is used to transfer one or more contents,
   each identified by a content type.  If desired, the content with
   attributes content type can be used to associate arbitrary attributes
   with the content.

   When CMS is used with MIME [MSG], there is no need to use this
   specification.  In this processing environment, MIME multipart [MIME]
   provides a straightforward and widely deployed mechanism for carrying
   more than one content, each associated with a MIME type.

   CMS is not always used with MIME.  Sometimes CMS is used in an
   exclusively ASN.1 [ASN1] environment.  In this case, the content
   collection content type is used to gather more than one content, each
   with an object identifier to provide the content type.

1.1  Content Collection Example

   This section provides one simple example to motivate the need for the
   content collection content type.

   Consider an art collector that wants to sell one of his pieces, an
   ancient Greek urn, called an amphora.  The collector wants to compose
   a digitally signed offer for sale.  It includes three parts.  The
   first part contains the owner's offer for sale, including the asking
   price.  The second part contains a high-quality image of the amphora.
   The final part contains an appraisal from a well-respected ceramics
   expert.  The final part is digitally signed by the expert.  Figure 1
   illustrates the structure, and the CMS SignedData content type is
   used for the two digital signatures.

1.2  Content with Attributes Example

   This section provides one simple example to motivate the need for the
   content with attributes content type.

   Consider the same art collector as in the previous example.  In stead
   of providing a single image of the amphora, the collector provides
   several images.  To aid potential buyers, the collector attaches
   several attributes to each image.  The attributes provide information
   about the resolution of the image, the date the image was taken, the
   photographer, and so on.  Figure 2 illustrates the collection of
   images, showing only two images, each with three attributes.  This
   entire image content collection could be carried instead of the
   single image shown in Figure 1, allowing it to be covered by the

2  Content Collection Content Type

   The content collection content type is used to transfer one or more
   contents, each identified by a content type.  The syntax accommodates
   contents with varying levels of protection.  For example, a content
   collection could include CMS protection content types as well as
   unprotected content types.  A content collection is expected to be
   encapsulated in one or more CMS protecting content types, but this is
   not required by this specification.

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2004


   The following object identifier names the content collection content
   type:

      id-ct-contentCollection OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
              iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
              pkcs9(9) smime(16) ct(1) 19 }

   The content collection content has the following syntax:

      ContentCollection ::= SEQUENCE OF ContentInfo

   The ContentCollection contains a sequence of ContentInfo, one for
   each content in the collection.  The ContentInfo structure is defined
   in CMS.  The contentType object identifier within the ContentInfo
   indicates the type of the associated content.  Implementations of
   this specification SHOULD be prepared to handle object identifiers
   for the SignedData, EncryptedData, EnvelopedData, and
   AuthenticatedData content types as specified in [CMS].
   Implementations of this specification SHOULD also be prepared to
   handle the object identifier for the CompressedData content type as
   specified in [COMPRESS].

3  Content With Attributes Content Type

   The content with attributes content type is used to transfer a single
   content, which is identified by a content type, and a collection of
   attributes associated with that content.  The syntax accommodates an
   arbitrary number of attributes; however, there must be at least on
   attribute.

   The following object identifier names the content with attributes
   content type:

      id-ct-contentWithAttrs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
              iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
              pkcs9(9) smime(16) ct(1) 20 }

   The content with attributes content has the following syntax:

      ContentWithAttributes ::= SEQUENCE {
          content     ContentInfo,
          attrs       SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute }

   The ContentWithAttributes contains a sequence of a single
   ContentInfo, followed by a sequence of attributes.  The ContentInfo
   structure is defined in CMS.  The contentType object identifier
   within the ContentInfo indicates the type of the content.  The
   Attribute stricture was originally defined in X.501 [X501], and the

   definition is repeated in CMS.
