IW = 2 * SMSS bytes and MUST NOT be more than 2 segments
    If (SMSS > 1095 bytes) and (SMSS <= 2190 bytes):
IW = 3 * SMSS bytes and MUST NOT be more than 3 segments
    if SMSS <= 1095 bytes:
IW = 4 * SMSS bytes and MUST NOT be more than 4 segments
    
    As specified in [RFC3390], the SYN/ACK and the acknowledgment of the
    SYN/ACK MUST NOT increase the size of the congestion window.
    Further, if the SYN or SYN/ACK is lost, the initial window used by a
    sender after a correctly transmitted SYN MUST be one segment
    consisting of at most SMSS bytes.
    
    A detailed rationale and discussion of the IW setting is provided in
    [RFC3390].

    When larger initial windows are implemented along with Path MTU
    Discovery [RFC1191], and the MSS being used is found to be too
    large, the congestion window cwnd SHOULD be reduced to prevent
    large bursts of smaller segments.  Specifically, cwnd SHOULD be
    reduced by the ratio of the old segment size to the new segment
    size.
    
    The initial value of ssthresh SHOULD be set arbitrarily high (e.g.,
    to the size of the largest possible advertised window), but ssthresh
    MUST be reduced in response to congestion.  Setting ssthresh as high
    as possible allows the network conditions, rather than some
    arbitrary host limit, to dictate the sending rate.  In cases where
    the end systems have a solid understanding of the network path, more
    carefully setting the initial ssthresh value may have merit (e.g.,
    such that the end host does not create congestion along the path).
    
    The slow start algorithm is used when cwnd < ssthresh, while the
    congestion avoidance algorithm is used when cwnd > ssthresh.  When
    cwnd and ssthresh are equal the sender may use either slow start or
    congestion avoidance.
    
    During slow start, a TCP increments cwnd by at most SMSS bytes for
    each ACK received that acknowledges new data.  Slow start ends when
    cwnd exceeds ssthresh (or, optionally, when it reaches it, as noted
ssthresh = max (FlightSize / 2, 2*SMSS)            (4)
