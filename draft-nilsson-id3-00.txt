Abstract

   This document is an informational description of the not formally
   standardized MPEG audio meta data format ID3.


1.  Conventions in this document

   This document does not use the keywords described in RFC 2119
   [RFC 2119], since this is not the definition of the ID3 tag. Hence,
   when this document states "recommended", it should be interpreted as
   recommendation for increased compatibility.


2.  History

   The audio compression defined as layer I, layer II and layer III in
   the MPEG-1 [MPEG-1] and MPEG-2 [MPEG-2] standards is a popular method
   of compressing audio with a low quality loss. The MPEG data in itself
   can only contain very little meta information, like if the audio is
   copy protected or not.

   To enable a richer experience and not having to rely on filenames to
   identify performer and title of MPEG audio, Eric Kemp created the
   tagging format ID3, presented with his program "Studio3" in 1996. By
   adding a small chunk of extra data in the end of the file one could
   get the MP3 file to carry information about the audio and not just
   the audio itself. The placement of the tag, as the data was called,
   was probably chosen as there were little chance that it should
   disturb decoders.


3.  Tag layout  

   The original ID3 tag, now also referred to as ID3v1, layout is the
   following:

    3 bytes  Identifier
   30 bytes  Songname
   30 bytes  Artist
   30 bytes  Album
    4 bytes  Year
   30 bytes  Comment
    1 byte   Genre


  A later modification to ID3v1 made by Michael Mutschler, sometimes
  also called ID3v1.1, has the following layout:

    3 bytes  Identifier
   30 bytes  Songname
   30 bytes  Artist
   30 bytes  Album
    4 bytes  Year
   28 bytes  Comment
    1 byte   Null
    1 byte   Track number
    1 byte   Genre

  Both ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 adds up to 128 bytes. If the content of a field
  is of lesser size than the field size, e.g. 30 characters, it should
  be null terminated.

  For the text fields, songname, artist, album and comment, different
  programs uses different character encodings, where the most used and
  recommended encoding is ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1], but one should not be
  surprised if one encounters a different character encoding.


3.1.  Identifier

  The ID3 tag identifier is the three byte string "TAG" encoded with
  ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1].


3.2.  Songname

  The name/title of the audio.


3.3.  Artist

  Presumably intended for the name of the performing artist, but also
  often used for composer in cases like classical music and movie music.


3.4.  Album

  The album from which the audio originated. This is sometimes a URL
  [URL] to an online music archive.


3.5.  Year

  This is a numeric string which presumably should be used for the year
  the audio was first released. Other existing uses are composition
  year, recording year and re-release year. The original release year
  is the recommended use. The numbers should always be encoded with
  ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1].


3.6.  Comment

  This field has given a lot of different uses, although seldom for
  actual comments since its size limitation to 30 characters. In ID3v1.1
  it is even more limited with a maximum text length of 28 characters,
  but according to Michael Mutschler that is not a problem since it was
  too limited from the beginning. Examples of uses for the comment filed
  includes CRC of the original PCM audio as well as URL [URL] to a
  relevant web page.


3.7.  Null

  In ID3v1.1 this byte is required to have the binary value zero (0x00).


3.8.  Track number

  In ID3v1.1 this byte indicate the track number that the song had on
  the album it came from. The track number is a binary value between 1
  and 255 (0x01 - 0xFF). In such cases where the 29:th byte is not null
  or when the 30:th byte is null, the track number is to be considered
  undefined. It is recommended that this value never is set to 255
  (0xFF). See the security considerations for details.


3.9.  Genre

  The genre is a one byte value referring to an item in a predefined
  list of genres.


4.  Genres

  While ID3 makes no claims to have a complete solution for genre
  taxonomy it provides a list that includes all major western genres as
  well as several convenient non-genres (oldies, vocal and instrumental
  to name a few). Some programs have added more genres above the value
  79 that are not supported by all ID3 software, and hence not
  recommended.

5.  Security considerations

  Since no formal standardization of ID3v1 exists all applications must
  be very fault tolerant and not expect a tag to be "well formed".
  Another factor to consider is that the ID3 tag is appended to the MPEG
  file and thus represents an unknown binary block for an ID3 unaware
  MPEG player. The problem is greatly reduced by the fact that an ID3
  block is smaller than an MPEG block, but the risk can be further
  reduced. By ensuring that the tag does not include a byte with all
  bits set (0xFF) there will be no possibility that the player will find
  a MPEG header by mistake, since a MPEG block begins with one and a
  half byte of set bits. The year and genre field is already restricted
  so that they can not be 0xFF. By disallowing the character represented
  by 0xFF and disallowing the track number to be greater than 254 there
  is no possibility for a false synchronization in the tag.
