1.  Introduction

   In order to enhance the privacy protection in DNS, several solutions
   have been developed to support the encrypted communications between
   stub and recursive resolvers, such as DNS-over-DTLS [RFC8094], DNS-
   over-TLS [RFC7858], DNS-over-QUIC and so on.  However, a scheme is
   needed in order to explicitly make the user aware of the privacy
   service supported by the recursive resolver in order to avoid the
   blind attempt by the user and support the user to bootstrap the
   preferred privacy protocol more easily.  This can be achieved during
   the user initial access, using extended DHCPv6 or ICMPv6 to configure
   its recursive resolver with related information (only IPv6 scenario
   is considered here).

2.  ICMPv6 based case

   The "Recursive DNS Server Option" is defined in [RFC8106] to support
   the user to configure DNS recursive resolver in the IPv6 SLAAC mode.
   Then an x-bit flag in the Reserved field of "Recursive DNS Server
   Option" can be used to indicate the privacy service of the
   corresponding recursive resolver specified in the field of "Addresses
   of IPv6 Recursive DNS Servers".  However, if this function is used,
   the "Addresses of IPv6 Recursive DNS Servers" should contain only one
   address of recursive resolver.  What the size of "x" and how to
   specify the flag corresponding to the supported privacy service of
   the recursive resolver will be detailed further.

3.  Other configuration cases

   The procedures based on the DHCPv6 or other configuration protocols
   [RFC3646][RFC4339]will also be considered further.

4.  Security considerations
