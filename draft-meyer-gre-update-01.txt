4.  Introduction

   A number of different proposals [RFC1234, RFC1226] currently exist
   for the encapsulation of one protocol over another protocol. Other
   types of encapsulations [RFC1241, SDRP, RFC1479] have been proposed
   for transporting IP over IP for policy purposes. This memo describes
   a protocol which is very similar to, but is more general than, the
   above proposals.  In attempting to be more general, many protocol
   specific nuances have been ignored.  The result is that this proposal
   may be less suitable for a situation where a specific "X over Y"
   encapsulation has been described.  It is the intent of this protocol
   to provide a simple, general purpose mechanism which reduces the
   problem of encapsulation from its current O(n^2) problem to a more
   manageable state. This memo purposely does not address the issue of
   when a packet should be encapsulated.  This memo acknowledges, but
   does not address problems such as mutual encapsulation [RFC1326].

   In the most general case, a system has a packet that needs to be
   encapsulated and delivered to some destination.  We will call this
   the payload packet.  The payload is first encapsulated in a GRE
   packet.  The resulting GRE packet can then be encapsulated in some
   other protocol and then forwarded.  We will call this outer protocol
   the delivery protocol. The algorithms for processing this packet are
   discussed later.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED,
   SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined
   in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.1.  Overall packet

   A GRE encapsulated packet has the form:

    ---------------------------------


4.2.  Packet header

   The GRE packet header has the form:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |C|       Reserved0       | Ver |         Protocol Type         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |      Checksum (optional)      |       Reserved1 (Optional)    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



4.3. Checksum Present (bit 0)

   If the Checksum Present bit is set to one, then the Checksum and the
   Reserved1 fields are present and the Checksum field contains valid
   information. Note that a compliant implementation MUST accept and
   process the these fields.



4.4.  Reserved0 (bits 1-12)

   Bits 1 through 12 are reserved for future use. A sender MUST set them
   to zero while a recipient MUST be prepared to deal with non-zero data
   as specified in section 7.









David Meyer                                                     [Page 3]





Internet Draft       draft-meyer-gre-update-01.txt        December, 1999


4.4.1.  Version Number (bits 13-15)

   The Version Number field MUST contain the value zero.


4.5.  Protocol Type (2 octets)

   The Protocol Type field contains the protocol type of the payload
   packet. These Protocol Types are defined in [RFC1700] as "ETHER
   TYPES" and in [ETYPES]. An implementation receiving a packet
   containing a Protocol Type which is not listed in [RFC1700] or
   [ETYPES] SHOULD discard the packet.



4.6.  Checksum (2 octets)

   The Checksum field contains the IP (one's complement) checksum sum of
   the all the 16 bit words in the GRE header and the payload packet.
   For purposes of computing the checksum, the value of the checksum
   field is zero. This field is present only if the Checksum Present bit
   is set to one.


4.7.  Reserved1 (2 octets)

   The Reserved1 field is reserved for future use, and if present, MUST
   be transmitted as zero. The Reserved1 field is present only when the
   Checksum field is present (that is, Checksum Present bit is set to
   one).



5. IPv4 as a Payload

   When IPv4 is being carried as the GRE payload, the Protocol Type
   field MUST be set to 0x800.


5.1.  Forwarding IPv4 Payload Packets

   When a tunnel endpoint decapsulates a GRE packet which has an IPv4
   packet as the payload, the destination address in the IPv4 payload
   packet header MUST be used to forward the packet and the TTL of the
   payload packet MUST be decremented. Care should be taken when
   forwarding such a packet, since if the destination address of the
   payload packet is the encapsulator of the packet (i.e., the other end
   of the tunnel), looping can occur. In this case, the packet MUST be

Internet Draft       draft-meyer-gre-update-01.txt        December, 1999


   discarded.


6. IPv4 as a Delivery Protocol

   The IPv4 protocol 47 [RFC1700] is used when GRE packets are
   enapsulated in IPv4. See [RFC1122] for requirements relating to the
   delivery of packets over IPv4 networks.



7. Interoperation with RFC 1701 Compliant Implementations

   In RFC 1701, the field described here as Reserved0 contained a number
   of flag bits which this specification deprecates. In particular, the
   Routing Present, Key Present, Sequence Number Present, and Strict
   Source Route bits have been deprecated, along with the Recursion
   Control field. As a result, the GRE header will never contain the
   Key, Sequence Number or Routing fields specified in RFC 1701.

   There are, however, existing implementations of the Informational RFC
   1701.  The following sections describe correct interoperation with
   such implementations.


7.1. RFC 1701 Compliant Receiver

   An implementation complying to this specification will transmit the
   Reserved0 field set to zero. An RFC 1701 compliant receiver will
   interpret this as having the Routing Present, Key Present, Sequence
   Number Present, and Strict Source Route bits set to zero, and will
   not expect the RFC 1701 Key, Sequence Number or Routing fields to be
   present.


7.2. RFC 1701 Compliant Transmitter

   An RFC 1701 transmitter may set any of the Routing Present, Key
   Present, Sequence Number Present, and Strict Source Route bits set to
   one, and thus may transmit the RFC 1701 Key, Sequence Number or
   Routing fields in the GRE header. In this case, an implementation
   compliant with this specification MAY discard the packet.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security in a network using GRE should be relatively similar to
   security in a normal IPv4 network, as routing using GRE follows the
   same routing that IPv4 uses natively. Route filtering will remain
   unchanged. However packet filtering requires either that a firewall
   look inside the GRE packet or that the filtering is done on the GRE
   tunnel endpoints. In those environments in which this is considered
   to be a security issue it may be desirable to terminate the tunnel at
   the firewall.


9. IANA Considerations for Assignment of Protocol Types

   New ETHER TYPES as assigned by Xerox Systems Institute [RFC1700]. The
   IANA SHOULD NOT encourage the assignment of additional ETHER TYPES
   (GRE Protocol Types) for use with GRE.

   This document is derived from the original ideas of the authors of
   RFC 1701 and RFC 1702. Brian Carpenter, Bill Fenner, Thomas Narten,

11. Appendix -- Known Issues

   This document specifies the behavior of currently deployed GRE
   implementations. As such, it does not attempt to address the
   following known issues:



11.1. Interaction Path MTU Discovery (PMTU) [RFC1191]

   An important issue here is that blackholes can arise if PMTU is used
   and the tunnel entry does not relay errors back to the originator of
   the packet. The black hole is realized by the following behavior: the
   originator sets the don't fragment bit in the delivery header, the
   packet gets dropped within the tunnel, but since the originator
   doesn't receive feedback, it retransmits with the same PMTU, causing
   subsequently transmitted packets to be dropped.

11.2. IPv6 as Delivery and/or Payload Protocol

   This specification describes the intersection of GRE currently
   deployed by multiple vendors. IPv6 as delivery and/or payload
   protocol is not included in the currently deployed versions of GRE.


11.3. Interaction with ICMP


11.4. Interaction with the Differentiated Services Architecture


11.5. Multiple and Looping Encapsulations
