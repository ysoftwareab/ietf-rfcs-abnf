Abstract 

   Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network (OTN) 
   and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically 
   deployed based on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are 
   often managed using proprietary interfaces to dedicated Element 
   Management Systems (EMS), Network Management Systems (NMS) and 
   increasingly Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers. 

   A well-defined open interface to each domain management system or    
   controller is required for network operators to facilitate control 
   automation and orchestrate end-to-end services across multi-domain 
   networks. These functions may be enabled using standardized data 
   models (e.g. YANG), and appropriate protocol (e.g., RESTCONF). 

   This document analyses the applicability of the YANG models being 
   defined by IETF (TEAS and CCAMP WGs in particular) to support OTN 
   single and multi-domain scenarios.

1. Introduction 

   Transport of packet services are critical for a wide-range of 
   applications and services, including data center and LAN 
   interconnects, Internet service backhauling mobile backhaul and 
   enterprise Carrier Ethernet Services. These services are typically 
   setup using stovepipe NMS and EMS platforms, often requiring 
   propriety management platforms and legacy management interfaces. A 
   clear goal of operators will be to automate the setup of transport 
   services across multiple transport technology domains.     

   A common open interface (API) to each domain controller and or 
   management system is pre-requisite for network operators to control 
   multi-vendor and multi-domain networks and also enable service 
   provisioning coordination/automation. This can be achieved by using 
   standardized YANG models, used together with an appropriate protocol 
   (e.g., [RESTCONF]). 

   This document analyses the applicability of the YANG models being 
   defined by IETF (TEAS and CCAMP WGs in particular) to support OTN 
   single and multi-domain scenarios. 

1.1. The scope of this document 

   This document assumes a reference architecture, including 
   interfaces, based on the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-
   Engineered Networks (ACTN), defined in [ACTN-Frame]. 

   The focus of this document is on the MPI (interface between the 
   Multi Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and a Physical Network 
   Controller (PNC), controlling a transport network domain). 

   It is worth noting that the same MPI analyzed in this document could 
   be used between hierarchical MDSC controllers, as shown in Figure 4 
   of [ACTN-Frame]. 

   Detailed analysis of the CMI (interface between the Customer Network 
   Controller (CNC) and the MDSC) as well as of the interface between 
   service and network orchestrators are outside the scope of this 
   document. However, some considerations and assumptions about the 
   information could be described when needed.

Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   The relationship between the current IETF YANG models and the type 
   of ACTN interfaces can be found in [ACTN-YANG]. Therefore, it 
   considers the TE Topology YANG model defined in [TE-TOPO], with the 
   OTN Topology augmentation defined in [OTN-TOPO] and the TE Tunnel 
   YANG model defined in [TE-TUNNEL], with the OTN Tunnel augmentation 
   defined in [OTN-TUNNEL]. 

   [Editors' note:] Add information about the additional models which 
   are needed for service configuration. 

   The ONF Technical Recommendations for Functional Requirements for 
   the transport API in [ONF TR-527] and the ONF transport API multi-
   domain examples in [ONF GitHub] have been considered as input for 
   defining the reference scenarios analyzed in this document. 

1.2. Assumptions 

   This document is making the following assumptions, still to be 
   validated with TEAS WG: 

   1. The MDSC can request, at the MPI, a PNC to setup a Transit Tunnel 
      Segment using the TE Tunnel YANG model: in this case, since the 
      endpoints of the E2E Tunnel are outside the domain controlled by 
      that PNC, the MDSC would not specify any source or destination 
      TTP (i.e., it would leave the source, destination, src-tp-id and 
      dst-tp-id attributes empty) for the tunnel and it would use the 
      explicit-route-object/route-object-include-exclude list to 
      specify the ingress and egress links for each path of the Transit 
      Tunnel Segment. 

   2. Each PNC provides to the MDSC, at the MPI, the list of available 
      timeslots on the inter-domain links using the TE Topology YANG 
      model and OTN Topology augmentation. The TE Topology YANG model 
      in [TE-TOPO] is being updated to report the label set 
      information. 

   [Editors' note:] These assumptions should be described in the TE 
   Tutorial and removed from this section (need to check the TE 
   Tutorial document). 

   This document is also making the following assumptions, still to be 
   validated with CCAMP WG: 

   1. The topology information for the Ethernet access links is 
      modelled using the YANG model defined in [Client-Topo].

Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   2. The service information for Ethernet and other OTN client layer 
      services are modelled using the YANG model defined in [Client-
      Signal]. 

   Finally, the Network Elements (NEs) described in the scenarios used 
   in document are using ODU switching. It is assumed that the ODU 
   links are pre-configured and using mechanisms such as WDM 
   wavelength, which are outside the scope of this document. 

2. Terminology 

   Domain: defined as a collection of network elements within a common 
   realm of address space or path computation responsibility [RFC5151] 

   E-LINE: Ethernet Line 

   EPL: Ethernet Private Line 

   EVPL: Ethernet Virtual Private Line 

   OTN: Optical Transport Network 

   Service: A service in the context of this document can be considered 
   as some form of connectivity between customer sites across the 
   network operator's network [RFC8309] 

   Service Model: As described in [RFC8309] it describes a service and 
   the parameters of the service in a portable way that can be used 
   uniformly and independent of the equipment and operating 
   environment. 

   UNI: User Network Interface  

   MDSC: Multi-Domain Service Coordinator 

   CNC: Customer Network Controller 

   PNC: Provisioning Network Controller 

   MAC Bridging: Virtual LANs (VLANs) on IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network 

   [Editors' note:] Add terminology for end-to-end data plane 
   connection, data plane segment connection.

3. Conventions used in this document 

3.1. Topology and traffic flow processing 

   The traffic flow between different nodes is specified as an ordered 
   list of nodes, separated with commas, indicating within the brackets 
   the processing within each node: 

      <node> (<processing>){, <node> (<processing>)} 

   The order represents the order of traffic flow being forwarded 
   through the network. 

   The processing can be either an adaptation of a client layer into a 
   server layer "(client -> server)" or switching at a given layer 
   "([switching])". Multi-layer switching is indicated by two layer 
   switching with client/server adaptation: "([client] -> [server])". 

   For example, the following traffic flow: 

      R1 ([PKT] -> ODU2), S3 ([ODU2]), S5 ([ODU2]), S6 ([ODU2]),  
      R3 (ODU2 -> [PKT]) 

   Node R1 is switching at the packet (PKT) layer and mapping packets 
   into an ODU2 before transmission to node S3. Nodes S3, S5 and S6 are 
   switching at the ODU2 layer: S3 sends the ODU2 traffic to S5 which 
   then sends it to S6 which finally sends to R3. Node R3 terminates 
   the ODU2 from S6 before switching at the packet (PKT) layer. 

   The paths of working and protection transport entities are specified 
   as an ordered list of nodes, separated with commas: 

      <node> {, <node>} 

   The order represents the order of traffic flow being forwarded 
   through the network in the forward direction. In case of 
   bidirectional paths, the forward and backward directions are 
   selected arbitrarily, but the convention is consistent between 
   working/protection path pairs as well as across multiple domains. 

3.2. JSON code 

   This document provides some detailed JSON code examples to describe 
   how the YANG models being developed by IETF (TEAS and CCAMP WG in 
   particular) can be used. 
 
 
Busi, King, et al.     Expires April 22, 2019                 [Page 7] 
    

    








Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   The examples are provided using JSON because JSON code is easier for 
   humans to read and write. 

   Different objects need to have an identifier. The convention used to 
   create mnemonic identifiers is to use the object name (e.g., S3 for 
   node S3), followed by its type (e.g., NODE), separated by an "-", 
   followed by "-ID". For example, the mnemonic identifier for node S3 
   would be S3-NODE-ID. 

   JSON language does not support the insertion of comments that have 
   been instead found to be useful when writing the examples. This 
   document will insert comments into the JSON code as JSON name/value 
   pair with the JSON name string starting with the "//" characters. 
   For example, when describing the example of a TE Topology instance 
   representing the ODU Abstract Topology exposed by the Transport PNC, 
   the following comment has been added to the JSON code: 

      "// comment": "ODU Abstract Topology @ MPI", 

   The JSON code examples provided in this document have been validated 
   against the YANG models following the validation process described 
   in Appendix A, which would not consider the comments. 

   In order to have successful validation of the examples, some 
   numbering scheme has been defined to assign identifiers to the 
   different entities which would pass the syntax checks. In that case, 
   to simplify the reading, another JSON name/value pair formatted as a 
   comment and using the mnemonic identifiers is also provided. For 
   example, the identifier of node S3 (S3-NODE-ID) has been assumed to 
   be "10.0.0.3" and would be shown in the JSON code example using the 
   two JSON name/value pair: 

      "// te-node-id": "S3-NODE-ID", 

      "te-node-id": "10.0.0.3", 

   The first JSON name/value pair will be automatically removed in the 
   first step of the validation process while the second JSON 
   name/value pair will be validated against the YANG model 
   definitions.

4. Scenarios Description 

4.1. Reference Network 

   The physical topology of the reference network is shown in Figure 1. 
   It represents an OTN network composed of three transport network 
   domains providing transport services to an IP customer network 
   through eight access links:

   ..........   :                      : 
            :   :   Network domain 1   :   .............

   This document assumes that all the transport network switching nodes 
   Si are OTN switching nodes capable of switching in the electrical 
   domain (ODU switching) and that all the Si-Sj OTN links within the 
   transport network (intra-domain or inter-domain) are 100G links 
   while the access Ri-Sj links are 10G links. Different technologies 
   can be used at the access links (e.g., Ethernet, STM-n, OTN). 

   It is also assumed that, within the transport network, the 
   physical/optical interconnections supporting the Si-Sj OTN links (up 
   to the OTU4 trail), are pre-configured using mechanisms which are 
   outside the scope of this document and are not exposed at the MPIs 
   to the MDSC. 

   The transport domain control architecture, shown in Figure 2, 
   follows the ACTN architecture and framework document [ACTN-Frame], 
   and functional components:

   The ACTN framework facilitates the detachment of the network and 
   service control from the underlying technology and helps the 
   customer express the network as desired by business needs. 
   Therefore, care must be taken to keep a minimal dependency on the 
   CMI (or no dependency at all) with respect to the network domain 
   technologies. The MPI instead requires some specialization according 
   to the domain technology.

Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   This document assumes that the CNC controls the customer IP network 
   and requests, at the CMI, transport connectivity between IP routers. 
   The MDSC coordinates, via three MPIs, the control of a multi-domain 
   transport network through three PNCs. 

   The control interfaces within the scope of this document are the 
   three MPIs, while the control interface(s) between the CNC and the 
   IP routers is outside the scope of this document. It is also assumed 
   that the CMI allows the CNC to provide all the information that is 
   required by the MDSC to properly configure the transport 
   connectivity requested by the customer. 

   [Editors' note:] Check the assumption above with the latest version 
   of the ACTN framework: it is the CNC or "something" above the CNC 
   which controls the customer IP network 

   In case the CNC requests transport connectivity between IP routers 
   attached to different transport domains (e.g., between R1 and R5), 
   the MDSC coordinates the setup of a multi-domain end-to-end OTN 
   connection across multiple PNCs (e.g., PNC1, PNC2 and PNC3 in in 
   Figure 2) as well as the configuration of the client signal mapping 
   at the PNCs controlling the edge domains (e.g., PNC1 and PNC2 in 
   Figure 2). 

4.1.1. Single-Domain Scenario 

   In case the CNC requests transport connectivity between IP routers 
   attached to the same transport domain (e.g., between R1 and R3 in 
   Figure 1), the MDSC can request the PNC controlling that domain 
   (e.g., PNC1 in Figure 2) to setup an intra-domain end-to-end OTN 
   connection and configure the client signal mapping. 

   Alternatively, the MDSC can just configure the client signal mapping 
   and let the PNC take decisions about how to implement the service 
   (e.g., setting up the intra-domain end-to-end OTN connection). 

4.2. Topology Abstractions 

   Abstraction provides a selective method for representing 
   connectivity information within a domain. There are multiple methods 
   to abstract a network topology. This document assumes the 
   abstraction method defined in [RFC7926]:  

     "Abstraction is the process of applying the policy to the 
     available TE information within a domain, to produce selective 
 
 
Busi, King, et al.     Expires April 22, 2019                [Page 12] 
    

    








Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

     information that represents the potential ability to connect 
     across the domain.  Thus, abstraction does not necessarily offer 
     all possible connectivity options, but presents a general view of 
     potential connectivity according to the policies that determine 
     how the domain's administrator wants to allow the domain resources 
     to be used." 

   [ACTN-Frame] Provides the context of topology abstraction in the 
   ACTN architecture and discusses a few alternatives for the 
   abstraction methods for both packet and optical networks. This is an 
   important consideration since the choice of the abstraction method 
   impacts protocol design and the information it carries.  According 
   to [ACTN-Frame], there are three types of topology: 

   o White topology: This is a case where the PNC provides the actual 
      network topology to the MDSC without any hiding or filtering. In 
      this case, the MDSC has the full knowledge of the underlying 
      network topology;  

   o Black topology: The entire domain network is abstracted as a 
      single virtual node with the access/egress links without 
      disclosing any node internal connectivity information; 

   o Grey topology: This abstraction level is between black topology 
      and white topology from a granularity point of view. This is an 
      abstraction of TE tunnels for all pairs of border nodes. We may 
      further differentiate from a perspective of how to abstract 
      internal TE resources between the pairs of border nodes:  

        - Grey topology type A: border nodes with TE links between them 
          in a full mesh fashion; 

        - Grey topology type B: border nodes with some internal 
          abstracted nodes and abstracted links. 

   Each PNC should provide the MDSC with a topology abstraction of the 
   domain's network topology. 

   Each PNC provides topology abstraction of its own domain topology 
   independently from each other, and therefore it is possible that 
   different PNCs provide different types of topology abstractions. 

   The MPI operates on the abstract topology regardless of, and 
   independently from, the type of abstraction provided by the PNC.

Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   To analyze how the MPI operates on abstract topologies independently 
   from the topology abstraction provided by each PNC and, therefore, 
   that different PNCs can provide different topology abstractions, 
   that the following examples are assumed: 

   o PNC1 provides a black topology abstraction which exposes at MPI1 
      a single virtual node (representing the whole network domain 1). 

   o PNC2 provides a black topology abstraction which exposes at MPI2 
      a single virtual node (representing the whole network domain 2). 

   o PNC3 provides a white topology abstraction which exposes at MPI3 
      all the physical nodes and links within network domain 3. 

   [Editors' note:] Evaluate whether to change the description of the 
   PNC2 abstraction to provide an example of a grey topology 
   abstraction (pending discussion about grey topology abstraction) 

   The MDSC should be capable of stitching together each abstracted 
   topology to build its own view of the multi-domain network topology. 
   The process may require suitable oversight, including administrative 
   configuration and trust models, but this is out of scope for this 
   document. 

   The MDSC can also provide topology abstraction of its own view of 
   the multi-domain network topology at its CMIs depending on the 
   customers' needs: it can provide different types of topology 
   abstractions at different CMIs. 

4.3. Service Configuration 

   In the following scenarios, it is assumed that the CNC is capable of 
   requesting service connectivity from the MDSC to support IP routers 
   connectivity. 

   The type of services could depend on the type of physical links 
   (e.g. OTN link, ETH link or SDH link) between the routers and 
   transport network. 

   The control of different adaptations inside IP routers, Ri (PKT -> 
   foo) and Rj (foo -> PKT), are assumed to be performed by means that 
   are not under the control of, and not visible to, the MDSC nor to 
   the PNCs. Therefore, these mechanisms are outside the scope of this 
   document.

Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   It is just assumed that the CNC is capable of requesting the proper 
   configuration of the different adaptation functions inside the 
   customer's IP routers, by means which are outside the scope of this 
   document. 

4.3.1. ODU Transit 

   The physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport 
   network can be 10G OTN links. In this case, it is assumed that the 
   physical/optical interconnections below the ODU layer (up to the 
   OTU2 trail) are pre-configured using mechanisms which are outside 
   the scope of this document and not exposed at the MPIs between the 
   PNCs and the MDSC. For simplicity of the description, it is also 
   assumed that these interfaces are not channelized (i.e., they can 
   only support one ODU2). 

   To setup a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R5, an ODU2 end-to-end 
   connection needs be created in the data plane between R1 and R5, 
   through transport nodes S3, S1, S2, S31, S33, S34, S15 and S18 which 
   belong to different PNC domains (multi-domain service request): 

      R1 ([PKT] -> ODU2), S3 ([ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]), S2 ([ODU2]), 
      S31 ([ODU2]), S33 ([ODU2]), S34 ([ODU2]), 
      S15 ([ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2]), R5 (ODU2 -> [PKT]) 

   It is assumed that, at the CMI, the CNC requests, using mechanisms 
   which are outside the scope of this document, the MDSC to setup of 
   an ODU2 transit service between the access links on S3 and S8 and 
   that the MDSC understands that it shall setup an ODU2 segment 
   connection between the access links on S3 and S18, which belongs to 
   different PNC domains (multi-domain service request). 

   To setup of a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R3, an ODU2 end-to-end 
   connection needs are created in the data plane between R1 and R3, 
   through transport nodes S3, S5 and S6 which belong to the same PNC 
   domain (single-domain service request): 

      R1 ([PKT] -> ODU2), S3 ([ODU2]), S5 ([ODU2]), S6 ([ODU2]),  
      R3 (ODU2 -> [PKT]) 

   Since the CNC is not aware of the transport network controlling 
   hierarchy, the mechanisms used by the CNC to request at the CMI the 
   MDSC to setup an ODU2 transit service are independent on whether the 
   service request is single-domain or multi-domain.

   Based on the assumption above, the MDSC understands that it shall 
   setup an ODU2 segment connection between the access links on S3 and 
   S6, which belong to the same PNC domain (single-domain service 
   request) and it can just pass the request at the MPI to PNC1 to 
   setup a single-domain ODU2 segment connection between its access 
   links on S3 and S6. 

4.3.2. EPL over ODU 

   The physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport 
   network can be Ethernet physical links. 

   To setup a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R5, an EPL service needs to 
   be created between R1 and R5, supported by an ODU2 end-to-end 
   connection in the data plane between transport nodes S3 and S18, 
   through transport nodes S1, S2, S31, S33, S34 and S15, which belong 
   to different PNC domains (multi-domain service request: 

      R1 ([PKT] -> ETH), S3 (ETH -> [ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]), 
      S2 ([ODU2]), S31 ([ODU2]), S33 ([ODU2]), S34 ([ODU2]), 
      S15 ([ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2] -> ETH), R5 (ETH -> [PKT]) 

   Based on the assumptions described in section 4.3.1, the CNC 
   requests at the CMI the MDSC to setup an EPL service between the 
   access links on S3 and S8 and the MDSC understands that it shall 
   setup an ODU2 end-to-end connection between nodes S3 and S18, which 
   belongs to different PNC domains (multi-domain service request). The 
   MDSC also understands how the adaptation functions inside nodes S3 
   and S18 (i.e., S3 (ETH -> [ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2] -> ETH), S18 (ETH -> 
   [ODU2]) and S3 ([ODU2] -> ETH)) should be configured. 

   To setup a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R3, an EPL service needs to 
   be created between R1 and R3, supported by an ODU2 end-to-end 
   connection in the data plane between transport nodes S3 and S6, 
   through the transport node S5, which belong to the same PNC domain 
   (single-domain service request): 

      R1 ([PKT] -> ETH), S3 (ETH -> [ODU2]), S5 ([ODU2]),  
      S6 ([ODU2] -> ETH), R3 (ETH-> [PKT]) 

   As described in section 4.3.1, the mechanisms used by the CNC at the 
   CMI are independent on whether the service request is single-domain 
   service or multi-domain.

   Based on the assumption above, the MDSC understands that it shall 
   setup an EPL service between the access links on S3 and S6, which 
   belong to the same PNC domain (single-domain service request) and it 
   can just pass the request at the MPI to PNC1 to setup a single-
   domain EPL service its access links on S3 and S6. In this case, PNC1 
   can take care of setting up the single-domain ODU2 end-to-end 
   connection between nodes S3 and S6 as well as of configuring the 
   adaptation functions on these edge nodes. 

4.3.3. Other OTN Clients Services 

   [ITU-T G.709] defines mappings of different client layers into   
   ODU. Most of them are used to provide Private Line services over    
   an OTN transport network supporting a variety of types of physical 
   access links (e.g., Ethernet, SDH STM-N, Fibre Channel, InfiniBand, 
   etc.). 

   The physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport 
   network can be any of these types. 

   In order to setup a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R5 using, for 
   example SDH physical links between the IP routers and the transport 
   network, an STM-64 Private Line service needs to be created between 
   R1 and R5, supported by an ODU2 end-to-end connection in the data 
   plane between transport nodes S3 and S18, through transport nodes 
   S1, S2, S31, S33, S34 and S15, which belong to different PNC domains 
   (multi-domain service request): 

      R1 ([PKT] -> STM-64), S3 (STM-64 -> [ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]), 
      S2 ([ODU2]), S31 ([ODU2]), S33 ([ODU2]), S34 ([ODU2]), 
      S15 ([ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2] -> STM-64), R5 (STM-64 -> [PKT]) 

   Based on the assumptions described in section 4.3.1, the CNC 
   requests the CMI the MDSC to setup an STM-64 Private Line service 
   between the access links on S3 and S8 and the MDSC understands what 
   to do as described in section 4.3.2 (multi-domain service request). 

   To setup a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R3), an STM-64 Private Line 
   service needs to be created between R1 and R3 (single-domain service 
   request): 

      R1 ([PKT] -> STM-64), S3 (STM-64 -> [ODU2]), S5 ([ODU2]),  
      S6 ([ODU2] -> STM-64), R3 (STM-64 -> [PKT])

   As described in section 4.3.1, the mechanisms used by the CNC at the 
   CMI are independent on whether the service request is single-domain 
   or multi-domain. 

   As described in section 4.3.2, the MDSC can just pass the request at 
   the MPI to PNC1 to setup a single-domain STM-64 Private Line service 
   between it access links on S3 and S6. 

4.3.4. EVPL over ODU 

   When the physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the 
   transport network are Ethernet physical links, it is also possible 
   that different Ethernet services (e.g., EVPL) can share the same 
   physical access link using different VLANs. 

   To setup two 1Gb IP links between R1 to R3 and between R1 and R5, 
   two EVPL services need to be created, supported by two ODU0 end-to-
   end connections in the data plane respectively between transport 
   nodes S3 and S6, through transport node S5, which belong ot the same 
   PNC domain (single-domain service request) and between transport 
   nodes S3 and S18, through transport nodes S1, S2, S31, S33, S34 and 
   S15, which belong to different PNC domains (multi-domain service 
   request): 

      R1 ([PKT] -> VLAN), S3 (VLAN -> [ODU0]), S1 ([ODU0]), 
      S2 ([ODU0]), S31 ([ODU0]), S33 ([ODU0]), S34 ([ODU0]), 
      S15 ([ODU0]), S18 ([ODU0] -> VLAN), R5 (VLAN -> [PKT]) 

      R1 ([PKT] -> VLAN), S3 (VLAN -> [ODU0]), S5 ([ODU0]),  
      S6 ([ODU0] -> VLAN), R3 (VLAN -> [PKT]) 

   Since the two EVPL services are sharing the same Ethernet physical 
   link between R1 and S3, different VLAN IDs are associated with 
   different EVPL services: for example, VLAN IDs 10 and 20 
   respectively. 

   Based on the assumptions described in section 4.3.1, the CNC 
   requests at the CMI the MDSC to setup these EVPL services and the 
   MDSC understands what to do as described in section 4.3.2. 

4.3.5. EVPLAN and EVPTree Services 

   When the physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the 
   transport network are Ethernet links, multipoint Ethernet services 
   (e.g., EPLAN and EPTree) can also be supported. It is also possible 
 
 
Busi, King, et al.     Expires April 22, 2019                [Page 18] 
    

    








Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   that multiple Ethernet services (e.g., EVPL, EVPLAN and EVPTree) 
   share the same physical link using different VLANs. 

   Note - it is assumed that EPLAN and EPTree services can be supported 
   by configuring EVPLAN and EVPTree with port mapping. 

   Since this EVPLAN/EVPTree service can share the same Ethernet 
   physical links between IP routers and transport nodes (e.g., with 
   the EVPL services described in section 4.3.4), a different VLAN ID 
   (e.g., 30) can be associated with this EVPLAN/EVPTree service. 

   In order to setup an IP subnet between R1, R2, R3 and R5, an 
   EVPLAN/EVPTree service needs to be created, supported by two ODUflex 
   end-to-end connections respectively between S3 and S6, crossing 
   transport node S5, and between S3 and S18, crossing transport nodes 
   S1, S2, S31, S33, S34 and S15 which belong to different PNC domains. 

   Some MAC Bridging capabilities are also required on some nodes at 
   the edge of the transport network: for example, Ethernet Bridging 
   capabilities can be configured in nodes S3 and S6: 

   o MAC Bridging in node S3 is needed to select, based on the MAC 
      Destination Address, whether received Ethernet frames should be 
      forwarded to R1 or to the ODUflex terminating on node S6 or to 
      the other ODUflex terminating on node S18; 

   o MAC bridging function in node S6 is needed to select, based on 
      the MAC Destination Address, whether received Ethernet frames 
      should be sent to R2 or to R3 or to the ODUflex terminating on 
      node S3. 

   In order to support an EVPTree service instead of an EVPLAN, 
   additional configuration of the Ethernet Bridging capabilities on 
   the nodes at the edge of the transport network is required. 

   The traffic flows between R1 and R3, between R3 and R5 and between 
   R1 and R5 can be summarized as: 

      R1 ([PKT] -> VLAN), S3 (VLAN -> [MAC] -> [ODUflex]), 
      S5 ([ODUflex]), S6 ([ODUflex] -> [MAC] -> VLAN), 
      R3 (VLAN -> [PKT]) 

      R3 ([PKT] -> VLAN), S6 (VLAN -> [MAC] -> [ODUflex]), 
      S5 ([ODUflex]), S3 ([ODUflex] -> [MAC] -> [ODUflex]), 
      S1 ([ODUflex]), S2 ([ODUflex]), S31 ([ODUflex]),

      S33 ([ODUflex]), S34 ([ODUflex]), 
      S15 ([ODUflex]), S18 ([ODUflex] -> VLAN), R5 (VLAN -> [PKT]) 

      R1 ([PKT] -> VLAN), S3 (VLAN -> [MAC] -> [ODUflex]), 
      S1 ([ODUflex]), S2 ([ODUflex]), S31 ([ODUflex]), 
      S33 ([ODUflex]), S34 ([ODUflex]), 
      S15 ([ODUflex]), S18 ([ODUflex] -> VLAN), R5 (VLAN -> [PKT]) 

   As described in section 4.3.2, it is assumed that the CNC is 
   capable, via the CMI, to request the setup of this EVPLAN/EVPTree 
   service, providing all the information that the MDSC needs to 
   understand that it need to request PNC1 to setup an ODUflex 
   connection between nodes S3 and S6 (single-domain service request) 
   and it also needs to coordinate the setup of a multi-domain ODUflex 
   connection between nodes S3 and S16 as well as the MAC bridging and 
   the adaptation functions on these edge nodes. 

   In case the CNC needs the setup of an EVPLAN/EVPTree service only 
   between R1, R2 and R3 (single-domain service request), it would 
   request the setup of this service in the same way as before and the 
   information provided at the CMI is sufficient for the MDSC to 
   understand that this is a single-domain service request. 

   The MDSC can then just request PNC1 to setup a single-domain 
   EVPLAN/EVPTree service between nodes S3 and S6. PNC1 can take care 
   of setting up the single-domain ODUflex end-to-end connection 
   between nodes S3 and S6 as well as of configuring the MAC bridging 
   and the adaptation functions on these edge nodes. 

4.3.6. Dynamic Service Configuration 

   Given the service established in the previous sections, there is a 
   demand for an update of some service characteristics. A 
   straightforward approach would be terminate the current service and 
   replace with a new one. Another more advanced approach would be a 
   dynamic configuration, in which case there will be no interruption 
   for the connection. 

   An example application would be updating the SLA information for a 
   certain connection. For example, an ODU transit connection is set up 
   according to section 4.3.1, with the corresponding SLA level of "no 
   protection". After the establishment of this connection, the user 
   would like to enhance this service by providing a restoration after 
   potential failure, and a request is generated on the CMI. In this 
   case, after receiving the request, the MDSC would need to send an

   update message to the PNC, changing the SLA parameters in TE Tunnel 
   model. Then the connection characteristic would be changed by PNC, 
   and a notification would be sent to MDSC for acknowledgement.  

4.4. Multi-function Access Links 

   Some physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport 
   network can be configured in different modes, e.g., as OTU2 or STM-
   64 or 10GE. 

   This configuration can be done a-priori by means outside the scope 
   of this document. In this case, these links will appear at the MPI 
   either as an ODU Link or as an STM-64 Link or as a 10GE Link 
   (depending on the a-priori configuration) and will be controlled at 
   the MPI as discussed in section 4.3. 

   It is also possible not to configure these links a-priori and give 
   the control to the MPI to decide, based on the service 
   configuration, how to configure it. 

   For example, if the physical link between R1 and S3 is a multi-
   functional access link while the physical links between R7 and S31 
   and between R5 and S18 are STM-64 and 10GE physical links 
   respectively, it is possible to configure either an STM-64 Private 
   Line service between R1 and R7 or an EPL service between R1 and R5. 

   The traffic flow between R1 and R7 can be summarized as: 

      R1 ([PKT] -> STM-64), S3 (STM-64 -> [ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]),  
      S2 ([ODU2]), S31 ([ODU2] -> STM-64), R3 (STM-64 -> [PKT]) 

   The traffic flow between R1 and R5 can be summarized as: 

      R1 ([PKT] -> ETH), S3 (ETH -> [ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]), 
      S2 ([ODU2]), S31 ([ODU2]), S33 ([ODU2]), S34 ([ODU2]), 
      S15 ([ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2] -> ETH), R5 (ETH -> [PKT]) 

   As described in section 4.3.2, it is assumed that the CNC is 
   capable, via the CMI, to request the setup either an STM-64 Private 
   Line service between R1 and R7 or an EPL service between R1 and R5, 
   providing all the information that the MDSC needs to understand that 
   it needs to coordinate the setup of a multi-domain ODU2 connection, 
   either between nodes S3 and S31, or between nodes S3 and S18, as 
   well as the adaptation functions on these edge nodes, and in

   particular whether the multi-function access link on between R1 and 
   S3 should operate as an STM-64 or as a 10GE link. 

4.5. Protection and Restoration Configuration 

   Protection switching provides a pre-allocated survivability 
   mechanism, typically provided via linear protection methods and 
   would be configured to operate as 1+1 unidirectional (the most 
   common OTN protection method), 1+1 bidirectional or 1:n 
   bidirectional. This ensures fast and simple service survivability. 

   Restoration methods would provide the capability to reroute and 
   restore connectivity traffic around network faults, without the 
   network penalty imposed with dedicated 1+1 protection schemes. 

   This section describes only services which are protected with linear 
   protection and with dynamic restoration.  

   The MDSC needs to be capable of coordinating different PNCs to 
   configure protection switching when requesting the setup of the 
   protected connectivity services described in section 4.3. 

   Since in these service examples, switching within the transport 
   network domain is performed only in the OTN ODU layer. Also 
   protection switching within the transport network domain can only be 
   provided at the OTN ODU layer. 

4.5.1. Linear Protection (end-to-end) 

   In order to protect any service defined in section 4.3 from failures 
   within the OTN multi-domain transport network, the MDSC should be 
   capable of coordinating different PNCs to configure and control OTN 
   linear protection in the data plane between nodes S3 and node S18. 

   It is assumed that the OTN linear protection is configured to with 
   1+1 unidirectional protection switching type, as defined in [ITU-T 
   G.808.1] and [ITU-T G.873.1], as well as in [RFC4427]. 

   In these scenarios, a working transport entity and a protection 
   transport entity, as defined in [ITU-T G.808.1], (or a working LSP 
   and a protection LSP, as defined in [RFC4427]) should be configured 
   in the data plane. 

   Two cases can be considered: 

 
 
Busi, King, et al.     Expires April 22, 2019                [Page 22] 
    

    








Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   o In one case, the working and protection transport entities pass 
      through the same PNC domains: 

         Working transport entity:   S3, S1, S2,  
                             S31, S33, S34, 
                             S15, S18 

         Protection transport entity: S3, S4, S8, 
                             S32, 
                             S12, S17, S18 

   o In another case, the working and protection transport entities 
      can pass through different PNC domains: 

         Working transport entity:   S3, S5, S7, 
                             S11, S12, S17, S18 

         Protection transport entity: S3, S1, S2, 
                             S31, S33, S34, 
                             S15, S18 

   The PNCs should be capable to report to the MDSC which is the active 
   transport entity, as defined in [ITU-T G.808.1], in the data plane. 

   Given the fast dynamic of protection switching operations in the 
   data plane (50ms recovery time), this reporting is not expected to 
   be in real-time. 

   It is also worth noting that with unidirectional protection 
   switching, e.g., 1+1 unidirectional protection switching, the active 
   transport entity may be different in the two directions. 

4.5.2. Segmented Protection 

   To protect any service defined in section 4.3 from failures within 
   the OTN multi-domain transport network, the MDSC should be capable 
   of requesting each PNC to configure OTN intra-domain protection when 
   requesting the setup of the ODU2 data plane connection segment. 

   If PNC1 provides linear protection, the working and protection 
   transport entities could be: 

      Working transport entity:   S3, S1, S2 

      Protection transport entity: S3, S4, S8, S2

Internet-Draft  Transport NBI Applicability-Statement      October 2018 
    

   If PNC2 provides linear protection, the working and protection 
   transport entities could be: 

      Working transport entity:   S15, S18 

      Protection transport entity: S15, S12, S17, S18 

   If PNC3 provides linear protection, the working and protection 
   transport entities could be: 

      Working transport entity:   S31, S33, S34 

      Protection transport entity: S31, S32, S34 

4.5.3. End-to-End Dynamic restoration 

   To restore any service defined in section 4.3 from failures within 
   the OTN multi-domain transport network, the MDSC should be capable 
   of coordinating different PNCs to configure and control OTN end-to-
   end dynamic Restoration in the data plane between nodes S3 and node 
   S18. For example, the MDSC can request the PNC1, PNC2 and PNC3 to 
   create a service with no-protection, MDSC set the end-to-end service 
   with the dynamic restoration.  

         Working transport entity:   S3, S1, S2,  
                             S31, S33, S34, 
                             S15, S18 

   When a link failure between S1 and s2 occurred in network domain 1, 
   PNC1 does not restore the tunnel and send the alarm notification to 
   the MDSC, MDSC will perform the end-to-end restoration. 

         Restored transport entity:   S3, S4, S8,  
                             S12, S15, S18 

4.5.4. Segmented Dynamic Restoration 

   To restore any service defined in section 4.3 from failures within 
   the OTN multi-domain transport network, the MDSC should be capable 
   of coordinating different PNCs to configure and control OTN 
   segmented dynamic Restoration in the data plane between nodes S3 and 
   node S18.

         Working transport entity:   S3, S1, S2,  
                             S31, S33, S34, 
                             S15, S18 

   When a link failure between S1 and s2 occurred in network domain 1, 
   PNC1 will restore the tunnel and send the alarm or tunnel update 
   notification to the MDSC, MDSC will update the restored tunnel. 

         Restored transport entity:   S3, S4, S8, S2  
                             S31, S33, S34, 
                             S15, S18 

   When a link failure between network domain 1 and network domain 2 
   occurred, PNC1 and PNC2 will send the alarm notification to the 
   MDSC, MDSC will update the restored tunnel. 

         Restored transport entity:   S3, S4, S8,  
                             S12, S15, S18 

   In order to improve the efficiency of recovery, the controller can 
   establish a recovery path in a concurrent way. When the recovery 
   fails in one domain or one network element, the rollback operation 
   should be supported. 

   The creation of the recovery path by the controller can use the 
   method of "make-before-break", in order to reduce the impact of the 
   recovery operation on the services. 

4.6. Service Modification and Deletion 

   [Editors' Note:] The service configuration include service creation, 
   modification and deletion. 

   For example, the service modification includes the service bandwidth 
   modification and service SLA level upgrade and degrade, such as 
   service protection type changed from no protection to 1+1 
   protection. 

   To be discussed in future versions of this document. 

4.7. Notification 

   To realize the topology update, service update and restoration 
   function, following notification type should be supported.

   1.       Object create 

   2.       Object delete 

   3.       Object state change 

   4.       Alarm 

   Because there are three types of topology abstraction type defined 
   in section 4.2, the notification should also be abstracted. The PNC 
   and MDSC should coordinate together to determine the notification 
   policy, such as when an intra-domain alarm occurred, the PNC may not 
   report the alarm but the service state change notification to the 
   MDSC. 

4.8. Path Computation with Constraint 

   It is possible to have constraint during path computation procedure; 
   typical cases include IRO/XRO and so on. This information is carried 
   in the TE Tunnel model and used when there is a request with 
   constraint. Consider the example in section 4.3.1. , the request can 
   be a Tunnel from R1 to R5 with an IRO from S2 to S31, then qualified 
   feedback would become:  

   R1 ([PKT] -> ODU2), S3 ([ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]), S2 ([ODU2]), 
   S31 ([ODU2]), S33 ([ODU2]), S34 ([ODU2]), 
   S15 ([ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2]), R5 (ODU2 -> [PKT]) 

   If the request covers the IRO from S8 to S12, then the above path 
   would not be qualified, while a possible computation result may be:  

   R1 ([PKT] -> ODU2), S3 ([ODU2]), S1 ([ODU2]), S2 ([ODU2]), 
   S8 ([ODU2]), S12 ([ODU2]), S15 ([ODU2]), S18 ([ODU2]), R5 (ODU2 -> 
   [PKT]) 

   Similarly, the XRO can be represented by the TE tunnel model as 
   well.  

   When there is a technology specific network (e.g., OTN), the 
   corresponding technology (OTN) model should also be used to specify 
   the tunnel information on MPI, with the constraint included in TE 
   Tunnel model.

5. YANG Model Analysis 

   This section provides a high-level overview of how IETF YANG models 
   can be used at the MPIs, between the MDSC and the PNCs, to support 
   the scenarios described in section 4. 

   Section 5.1 describes the different topology abstractions provided 
   to the MDSC by each PNC via its own MPI. 

   Section 5.2 describes how the MDSC can coordinate different requests 
   to different PNCs, via their own MPIs, to setup the different 
   services described in section 4.3. 

   Section 5.3 describes how the protection scenarios can be deployed, 
   including end-to-end protection and segment protection, for both 
   intra-domain and inter-domain scenario.  

5.1. YANG Models for Topology Abstraction 

   Each PNC reports its respective abstract topology to the MDSC, as 
   described in section 4.2.

5.1.1. Domain 1 Black Topology Abstraction 

   PNC1 provides the required black topology abstraction, as described 
   in section 4.2, to expose to the MDSC, at MPI1, one TE Topology 
   instance for the ODU layer (MPI1 OTN Topology) containing only one 
   abstract TE node (i.e., AN1) and only inter-domain and access 
   abstract TE links (which represent the inter-domain and access 
   physical links), as shown in Figure 3 below.

      Figure 3 - Abstract Topology exposed at MPI1 (MPI1 OTN Topology) 

   [Editors' note:] Update figure 3 to match with the new topology 
   abstraction 

    

   As described in section 4.1, it is assumed that the physical links 
   between the physical nodes are pre-configured and therefore PNC1 
   exports at MPI1 one abstract TE Link, within the MPI1 OTN topology, 
   for each OTU2 or OTU4 trail which support an abstract TE link in the 
   MPI1 ODU Topology. 

   [Editors' note:] Add some description about the relationship between 
   the abstract and the physical topology within the PNC1 "brain."

   Appendix B.1.1 provides the detailed JSON code example ("mpi1-otn-
   topology.json") describing how this ODU Topology is reported by the 
   PNC, using the [TE-TOPO] and [OTN-TOPO] YANG models at MPI1. 

   It is worth noting that this JSON code example does not provide all 
   the attributes defined in the relevant YANG models: 

   o YANG attributes which are outside the scope of this document are 
      not shown 

   o The attributes describing the label restrictions are also not 
      shown to simplify the JSON code example 

   o The comments describing the rationale for not including some 
      attributes in this JSON code example even if in the scope of this 
      document are identified with the prefix "// __COMMENT__" and 
      included only in the first object instance (e.g., in the Access 
      Link from the AN1-1 description or in the AN1-1 LTP description) 

5.1.2. Domain 2 Black Topology Abstraction 

   PNC2 provides the required black topology abstraction, as described 
   in section 4.2, to expose to the MDSC, at MPI2, one TE Topology 
   instance for the ODU layer (MPI2 OTN Topology) containing only one 
   abstract node (i.e., AN2) and only inter-domain and access abstract 
   TE links (which represent the inter-domain and access physical 
   links). 

5.1.3. Domain 3 White Topology Abstraction 

   PNC3 provides the required white topology abstraction, as described 
   in section 4.2,  to expose to the MDSC, at MPI3, one TE Topology 
   instance for the ODU layer (MPI3 OTN Topology) containing one 
   abstract TE node for each physical node and one abstract TE link for

   each physical link (internal links, inter-domain links or access 
   links). 

5.1.4. Multi-domain Topology Stitching 

   As assumed at the beginning of this section, MDSC does not have any 
   knowledge of the topologies of each domain until each PNC reports 
   its own abstraction topology, so the MDSC needs to merge together 
   the abstract topologies provided by different PNCs, at the MPIs, to 
   build its own topology view, as described in section 4.3 of [TE-
   TOPO].  

   Given the topologies reported from multiple PNCs, the MDSC need to 
   stitch the multi-domain topology and obtain the full map of 
   topology. The topology of each domain may be in an abstracted shape 
   (refer to section 5.2 of [ACTN-Fwk] for a different level of 
   abstraction), while the inter-domain link information MUST be 
   complete and fully configured by the MDSC.  

   The inter-domain link information is reported to the MDSC by the two 
   PNCs, controlling the two ends of the inter-domain link. 

   The MDSC needs to understand how to "stitch" together these inter-
   domain links. 

   One possibility is to use the plug-id information, defined in [TE-
   TOPO]: two inter-domain links reporting the same plug-id value can 
   be merged as a single intra-domain link within any MDSC native 
   topology. The value of the reported plug-id information can be 
   either assigned by a central network authority, and configured 
   within the two PNC domains, or it can be discovered using automatic 
   discovery mechanisms (e.g., LMP-based, as defined in [RFC6898]). 

   In case the plug-id values are assigned by a central authority, it 
   is under the central authority responsibility to assign unique 
   values. 

   In case the plug-id values are automatically discovered, the 
   information discovered by the automatic discovery mechanisms needs 
   to be encoded as a bit string within the plug-id value. This 
   encoding is implementation specific, but the encoding rules need to 
   be consistent across all the PNCs. 

   In case of co-existence within the same network of multiple sources 
   for the plug-id (e.g., central authority and automatic discovery or

   even different automatic discovery mechanisms), it is RECOMMENDED 
   that the plug-id namespace is partitioned to avoid that different 
   sources assign the same plug-id value to different inter-domain 
   link. The encoding of the plug-id namespace within the plug-id value 
   is implementation specific but needs to be consistent across all the 
   PNCs. 

   Another possibility is to pre-configure, either in the adjacent PNCs 
   or in the MDSC, the association between the inter-domain link 
   identifiers (topology-id, node-id and tp-id) assigned by the two 
   adjacent PNCs to the same inter-domain link. 

   This last scenario requires further investigation and will be 
   discussed in a future version of this document. 

   [Editors' note:] Add some description of the abstract multi-domain 
   topology within the MDSC "brain."

5.1.5. Access Links 

   Access links in Figure 3 are shown as ODU Links: the modeling of the 
   access links for other access technologies is currently an open 
   issue. 

   The modeling of the access link in case of non-ODU access technology 
   has also an impact on the need to model ODU TTPs and layer

   transition capabilities on the edge nodes (e.g., nodes S2, S3, S6 
   and S8 in Figure 3). 

   If, for example, the physical NE S6 is implemented in a "pizza box", 
   the data plane would have only set of ODU termination resources 
   (where up to 2xODU4, 4xODU3, 20xODU2, 80xODU1, 160xODU0 and 
   160xODUflex can be terminated). The traffic coming from each of the 
   10GE access links can be mapped into any of these ODU terminations. 

   Instead if, for example, the physical NE S6 can be implemented as a 
   multi-board system where access links reside on different/dedicated 
   access cards with a separated set of ODU termination resources 
   (where up to 1xODU4, 2xODU3, 10xODU2, 40xODU1, 80xODU0 and 
   80xODUflex for each resource can be terminated). The traffic coming 
   from one 10GE access links can be mapped only into the ODU 
   terminations which reside on the same access card. 

   The more generic implementation option for a physical NE (e.g., S6) 
   would be the case is of a multi-board system with multiple access 
   cards with separated sets of access links and ODU termination 
   resources (where up to 1xODU4, 2xODU3, 10xODU2, 40xODU1, 80xODU0 and 
   80xODUflex for each resource can be terminated). The traffic coming 
   from each of the 10GE access links on one access card can be mapped 
   only into any of the ODU terminations which reside on the same 
   access card. 

   In the last two cases, only the ODUs terminated on the same access 
   card where the access links reside can carry the traffic coming from 
   that 10GE access link. Terminated ODUs can instead be sent to any of 
   the OTU4 interfaces 

   In all these cases, terminated ODUs can be sent to any of the OTU4 
   interfaces assuming the implementation is based on a non-blocking 
   ODU cross-connect. 

   If the access links are reported via MPI in some, still to be 
   defined, client topology, it is possible to report each set of ODU 
   termination resources as an ODU TTP within the ODU Topology of 
   Figure 3 and to use either the inter-layer lock-id or the 
   transitional link, as described in sections 3.4 and 3.10 of [TE-
   TOPO], to correlate the access links, in the client topology, with 
   the ODU TTPs, in the OTN topology, to which access link are 
   connected to.

5.2. YANG Models for Service Configuration 

   The service configuration procedure is assumed to be initiated (step 
   1 in Figure 6) at the CMI from CNC to MDSC. Analysis of the CMI 
   models is (e.g., L1SM, L2SM, Transport-Service, VN, et al.) is 
   outside the scope of this document. 

   As described in section 4.3, it is assumed that the CMI YANG models 
   provide all the information that allows the MDSC to understand that 
   it needs to coordinate the setup of a multi-domain ODU connection 
   (or connection segment) and, when needed, also the configuration of 
   the adaptation functions in the edge nodes belonging to different 
   domains.

   After receiving such request, MDSC determines the domain sequence, 
   i.e., domain 1 <-> domain 2 <-> domain 3, with corresponding PNCs 
   and inter-domain links (step 2 in Figure 6). 

   As described in [PATH-COMPUTE], the domain sequence can be 
   determined by running the MDSC own path computation on the MDSC 
   internal topology, defined in section 5.1.4, if and only if the MDSC 
   has enough topology information. Otherwise, the MDSC can send path 
   computation requests to the different PNCs (steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 
   in Figure 6) and use this information to determine the optimal path 
   on its internal topology and therefore the domain sequence. 

   The MDSC will then decompose the tunnel request into a few tunnel 
   segments via tunnel model (including both TE tunnel model and OTN 
   tunnel model), and request different PNCs to setup each intra-domain 
   tunnel segment (steps 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in Figure 6).  

   Assume that each intra-domain tunnel segment can be set up 
   successfully, and each PNC response to the MDSC respectively. Based 
   on each segment, MDSC will take care of the configuration of both 
   the intra-domain tunnel segment and inter-domain tunnel via 
   corresponding MPI (via TE tunnel model and OTN tunnel model). More 
   specifically, for the inter-domain configuration, the ts-bitmap and 
   tpn attributes need to be configured using the OTN Tunnel model. 
   Then the end-to-end OTN tunnel will be ready.  

   In any case, the access link configuration is done only on the PNCs 
   that control the access links (e.g., PNC-1 and PNC-3 in our example) 
   and not on the PNCs of transit domain (e.g., PNC-2 in our example). 
   An access link will be configured by MDSC after the OTN tunnel is 
   set up. Access configuration is different and dependent on the 
   different type of service. More details can be found in the 
   following sections. 

   [Editor's Note:] Add some notes for the single-domain case 

5.2.1. ODU Transit Service 

   In this scenario, described in section 4.3.1, the access links are 
   configured as ODU Links. 

   Since it is assumed that the physical access links are pre-
   configured, each PNC exposes, at its MPI, one TE Link (called "ODU 
   Link") for each of these physical access link. These links are 
   reported, together with any other ODU internal or inter-domain link,

   within the OTN abstract topology exposed by each PNC, at its own 
   MPI. 

   To setup this IP link, between R1 and R5, the CNC requests, at the 
   CMI, the MDSC to setup an ODU transit service. 

   From the topology information described in section 5.1 above, the 
   MDSC understands that R1 is attached to the access link terminating 
   on S3-1 LTP in the ODU Topology exposed by PNC1 and that R5 is 
   attached to the access link terminating on AN2-1 LTP in the ODU 
   Topology exposed by PNC2. 

   [Editors' note:] Add some information about the path computation 
   step. 

   MDSC would then request, at MPI1, the PNC1 to setup an ODU2 (Transit 
   Segment) Tunnel with one primary path between S3-1 and S2-1 LTPs: 

   o Source and Destination TTPs are not specified (since it is a 
      Transit Tunnel) 

   o Ingress and egress points are indicated in the route-object-
      include-exclude list of the explicit-route-objects of the primary 
      path: 

        o The first element references the access link terminating on 
          S3-1 LTP 

   [Editor's note:] The need for the second element is for further 
   study. 

        o The last two element references respectively the inter-domain 
          link terminating on S2-1 LTP and the data plane resources 
          (i.e., the timeslots and the TPN, called "OTN Label") used by 
          the ODU2 connection over that link. 

   The configuration of the timeslots used by the ODU2 connection on 
   the internal links within a PNC domain (i.e., on the internal links 
   domain) is outside the scope of this document since it is a matter 
   of the PNC domain internal implementation. 

   However, the configuration of the timeslots used by the ODU2 
   connection at the transport network domain boundaries (e.g., on the 
   inter-domain links) needs to take into account the timeslots 
   available on physical nodes belonging to different PNC domains

   (e.g., on node S2 within PNC1 domain and on node S31 within PNC3 
   domain). 

   The MDSC, when coordinating the setup of a multi-domain ODU 
   connection, also configures the data plane resources (i.e., the 
   timeslots and the TPN) to be used on the inter-domain links. The 
   MDSC can know the timeslots which are available on the physical OTN 
   nodes terminating the inter-domain links (e.g., S2 and S31) from the 
   OTN Topology information exposed, at the MPIs, by the PNCs 
   controlling the OTN physical nodes (e.g., PNC1 and PNC3 controlling 
   the physical nodes S2 and S31 respectively). 

   [Editor's note:] These working assumptions seem generic and not 
   specific for the YANG models defined by IETF: should we move it to 
   section 4? 

   Appendix B.2.1 provides the detailed JSON code ("mpi1-odu2-service-
   config.json") describing how the setup of this ODU2 (Transit 
   Segment) Tunnel can be requested by the MDSC, using the [TE-TUNNEL] 
   and [OTN-TUNNEL] YANG models at MPI1. 

   The Transport PNC performs path computation and sets up the ODU2 
   cross-connections within the physical nodes S3, S5 and S6, as shown 
   in section 4.3.1.

   as well as the status reporting. 

5.2.1.1. Single Domain Example

   an ODU transit service.

   scenario.

   configured as Ethernet Links.

   are multi-function access links

   To setup this IP link, between R1 and R5, the CNC requests, at the 
   CMI, the MDSC to setup an EPL service. 

   As described in section 5.1.5 above, it is not clear in this case 
   how the Ethernet access links between the transport network and the 
   IP router, are reported by the PNC to the MDSC. 

   If the 10GE physical links are not reported as ODU links within the 
   OTN topology information, described in section 5.1.1 above than the 
   MDSC will not have sufficient information to know that R1 and R5 are 
   attached to the access links terminating on S3 and S6. 

   Assuming that the MDSC knows how R1 and R3 are attached to the 
   transport network, the MDSC would request the Transport PNC to setup 
   an ODU2 end-to-end Tunnel between S3 and S6. 

   This ODU Tunnel is setup between two TTPs of nodes S3 and S6. In 
   case of nodes S3 and S6 support more than one TTP, the MDSC should 
   decide which TTP to use. 

   As discussed in 5.1.5, depending on the different hardware 
   implementations of the physical nodes S3 and S6, not all the access 
   links can be connected to all the TTPs. The MDSC should therefore 
   select not only the optimal TTP but also a TTP that would allow the 
   Tunnel to be used by the service. 

   It is assumed that in case of node S3 or node S6 supports only one 
   TTP, this TTP can be accessed by all the access links. 

   Appendix B.2.2 provides the detailed JSON code ("mpi1-odu2-tunnel-
   config.json") describing how the setup of this ODU2 (Head Segment) 
   Tunnel can be requested by the MDSC, using the [TE-TUNNEL] and [OTN-
   TUNNEL] YANG models at MPI1. 

   Once the ODU2 Tunnel setup has been requested, unless there is a 
   one-to-one relationship between the S3 and S6 TTPs and the Ethernet 
   access links toward R1 and R3 (as in the case, described in section 
   5.1.5, where the Ethernet access links reside on different/dedicated 
   access card such that the ODU2 tunnel can only carry the Ethernet 
   traffic from the only Ethernet access link on the same access card 
   where the ODU2 tunnel is terminated), the MDSC also needs to request 
   the setup of an EPL service from the access links on S3 and S6, 
   attached to R1 and R3, and this ODU2 Tunnel.

   Appendix B.2.3 provides the detailed JSON code ("mpi1-epl-service-
   config.json") describing how the setup of this EPL service using the 
   ODU2 Tunnel can be requested by the MDSC, using the [CLIENT-SVC] 
   YANG model at MPI1. 

5.2.3. Other OTN Client Services  

   [Editor's Note:] Update this section to describe the multi-domain 
   scenario 

   In this scenario, the access links are configured as one of the OTN 
   clients (e.g., STM-64) links. 

   [Editor's Note:] Add considerations for the case the access links 
   are multi-function access links 

   As described in section 4.3.3, the CNC needs to setup an STM-64 
   Private Link service, supporting an IP link, between R1 and R3 and 
   requests this service at the CMI to the MDSC. 

   MDSC needs to setup an STM-64 Private Link service between R1 and R3 
   supported by an ODU2 end-to-end connection between S3 and S6. 

   As described in section 5.1.5 above, it is not clear in this case 
   how the access links (e.g., the STM-N access links) between the 
   transport network and the IP router, are reported by the PNC to the 
   MDSC. 

   The same issues, as described in section 5.2.2, apply here: 

   o the MDSC needs to understand that R1 and R3 are connected, 
      thought STM-64 access links, with S3 and S6 

   o the MDSC needs to understand which TTPs in S3 and S6 can be 
      accessed by these access links 

   o the MDSC needs to configure the private line service from these 
      access links through the ODU2 tunnel 

5.2.4. EVPL over ODU Service  

   [Editor's Note:] Update this section to describe the multi-domain 
   scenario

   In this scenario, the access links are configured as Ethernet links, 
   as described in section 5.2.2 above. 

   As described in section 4.3.4, the CNC needs to setup EVPL services, 
   supporting IP links, between R1 and R3, as well as between R1 and R4 
   and requests these services at the CMI to the MDSC. 

   MDSC needs to setup two EVPL services, between R1 and R3, as well as 
   between R1 and R4, supported by ODU0 end-to-end connections between 
   S3 and S6 and between S3 and S2 respectively. 

   As described in section 5.1.5 above, it is not clear in this case 
   how the Ethernet access links between the transport network and the 
   IP router, are reported by the PNC to the MDSC. 

   The same issues, as described in section 5.1.5 above, apply here: 

   o the MDSC needs to understand that R1, R3 and R4 are connected, 
      thought the Ethernet access links, with S3, S6 and S2 

   o the MDSC needs to understand which TTPs in S3, S6 and S2 can be 
      accessed by these access links 

   o the MDSC needs to configure the EVPL services from these access 
      links through the ODU0 tunnels 

   In addition, the MDSC needs to get the information that the access 
   links on S3, S6 and S2 are capable of supporting EVPL (rather than 
   just EPL) as well as to coordinate the VLAN configuration, for each 
   EVPL service, on these access links (this is a similar issue as the 
   timeslot configuration on access links discussed in section 4.3.1 
   above).

6. Security Considerations 

   Inherently OTN networks ensure privacy and security via hard 
   partitioning of traffic onto dedicated circuits. The separation of 
   network traffic makes it difficult to intercept data transferred 
   between nodes over OTN-channelized links.  

   This document analyses the applicability of the YANG models being 
   defined by the IETF to support OTN single and multi-domain scenarios 
   There are no specific new security considerations introduced by this 
   document.  

   In OTN the (General Communication Channel) GCC is used for OAM 
   functions such as performance monitoring, fault detection, and 
   signaling. The GCC control channel should be secured using a 
   suitable mechanism.   

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires no IANA actions.

           Validating a JSON fragment against a YANG Model 

   The objective is to have a tool that allows validating whether a 
   piece of JSON code embedded in an Internet-Draft is compliant with a 
   YANG model without using a client/server. 

A.1. Manipulation of JSON fragments 

   This section describes the various ways JSON fragments are used in 
   the I-D processing and how to manage them. 

   Let's call "folded-JSON" the JSON embedded in the I-D: it fits the 
   72 chars width and it is acceptable for it to be invalid JSON. 

   We then define "unfolded-JSON" a valid JSON fragment having the same 
   contents of the "folded-JSON " without folding, i.e. limits on the 
   text width. The folding/unfolding operation may be done according to 
   draft-kwatsen-netmod-artwork-folding. The "unfolded-JSON" can be 
   edited by the authors using JSON editors with the advantages of 
   syntax validation and pretty-printing. 

   Both the "folded" and the "unfolded" JSON fragments can include 
   comments having descriptive fields and directives we'll describe 
   later to facilitate the reader and enable some automatic processing.  

   The presence of comments in the "unfolded-JSON" fragment makes it an 
   invalid JSON encoding of YANG data. Therefore we call "naked JSON" 
   the JSON where the comments have been stripped out: not only it is 
   valid JSON but it is a valid JSON encoding of YANG data. 

   The following schema resumes these definitions: 

                       unfold_it -->             stripper --> 

             Folded-JSON           Unfolded-JSON             Naked JSON 

                       <-- fold_it              <-- author edits 

   <=72-chars?    MUST              MAY                      MAY 

   valid JSON?     MAY             MUST                     MUST 

   JSON-encoding   MAY              MAY                     MUST 

   of YANG data

   Our validation toolchain has been designed to take a JSON in any of 
   the three formats and validate it automatically against a set of 
   relevant YANG modules using available open-source tools. It can be 
   found at: https://github.com/GianmarcoBruno/json-yang/ 

A.2. Comments in JSON fragments 

   We found useful to introduce two kinds of comments, both defined as 
   key-value pairs where the key starts with "//": 

   - free-form descriptive comments, e.g."// COMMENT" : "refine this" 
   to describe properties of JSON fragments. 

   - machine-usable directives e.g. "// __REFERENCES__DRAFTS__" : { 
   "ietf-routing-types@2017-12-04": "rfc8294",} which can be used to 
   automatically download from the network the relevant I-Ds or RFCs 
   and extract from them the YANG models of interest. This is 
   particularly useful to keep consistency when the drafting work is 
   rapidly evolving. 

A.3. Validation of JSON fragments: DSDL-based approach 

   The idea is to generate a JSON driver file (JTOX) from YANG, then 
   use it to translate JSON to XML and validate it against the DSDL 
   schemas, as shown in Figure 8. 

   Useful link: https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang/wiki/XmlJson

   In order to allow the use of comments following the convention 
   defined in section 3without impacting the validation process, these 
   comments will be automatically removed from the JSON-file that will 
   be validate. 

A.4. Validation of JSON fragments: why not using a XSD-based approach 

   This approach has been analyzed and discarded because no longer 
   supported by pyang. 

   The idea is to convert YANG to XSD, JSON to XML and validate it 
   against the XSD, as shown in Figure 9: 

                     (1)  
         YANG-module ---> XSD-schema - \       (3) 
                                        +--> Validation 
         JSON-file------> XML-file ----/ 
                     (2) 
    
            Figure 9 - XSD-based approach for JSON code validation 

   The pyang support for the XSD output format was deprecated in 1.5 
   and removed in 1.7.1. However pyang 1.7.1 is necessary to work with 
   YANG 1.1 so the process shown in Figure 9 will stop just at step 
   (1).
