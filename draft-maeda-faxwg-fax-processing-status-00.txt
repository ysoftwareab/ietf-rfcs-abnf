Abstract

  This proposal describes a fax processing status which was requested 
in ITU-T SG16 meeting on November 2000 at Geneva, for Full Mode.  
The notification of success/failure of document processing and page 
by page status from the receiver is very important feature for the 
internet fax.

  NOTE: This is an early, preliminary version of specification,
  indicating a possible way to achieve the notification of success/
  failure of document processing and page by page status  for Full 
  Mode Internet fax.  The content is rough, and
  the intent at this time is to indicate the outline of a mechanism.
  Please address comments to major structural and semantic issues.
