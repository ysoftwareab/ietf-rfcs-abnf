         Definition of the ROLIE Software Descriptor Extension
              draft-ietf-sacm-rolie-softwaredescriptor-08

Abstract

   This document uses the "information-type" extension point as defined
   in the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE)
   [RFC8322] Section 7.1.2 to better support Software Record and
   Software Inventory use cases.  This specification registers a new
   ROLIE information-type, "software-descriptor", that allows for the
   categorization of information relevant to software description
   activities and formats.  In particular, the usage of the ISO
   19770-2:2015 Software Identification Tag (SWID Tag) and the Concise
   SWID (COSWID) formats in ROLIE are standardized.  Additionally, this
   document discusses requirements and usage of other ROLIE elements in
   order to best syndicate software description information.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) [RFC8322] to support the
   publication of software descriptor information.  Software descriptor
   information is information that characterizes static software
   components, packages, and installers; including identification,
   version, software creation and publication, and file artifact
   information.

   Software descriptor information provides data about what might be
   installed, but doesn't describe a specific software installation's

   configuration or execution.  This static approach to software
   description is a tightly limited scope that still covers the majority
   of current use cases for software inventory and record keeping.

   Some possible use cases for software descriptor information ROLIE
   Feeds (Section 6.1 of [RFC8322]) include:

   o  Software providers can publish software descriptor information so
      that software researchers, enterprises, and users of software can
      understand the collection of software produced by that software
      provider.

   o  Organizations can aggregate and syndicate collections of software
      descriptor information provided by multiple software providers to
      support software-related analysis processes (e.g., vulnerability
      analysis) and to provide downsteam services (e.g., software
      configuration checklist repositories).

   o  End user organizations can consume software descriptor information
      along with related software vulnerability and configuration
      information to provide the data needed to automate software asset,
      patch, and configuration management practices.

   o  Organizations can use software descriptors to support verification
      of other entities through integrity measurement mechanisms.

   This document supports these use cases by describing the content
   requirements for Feeds and Entries of software descriptor information
   that are to be published to or retrieved from a ROLIE repository.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   As an extension of [RFC8322], this document refers to many terms
   defined in that document.  In particular, the use of "Entry" and
   "Feed" are aligned with the definitions presented in RFC8322.

   Several places in this document refer to the "information-type" of a
   Resource (Entry or Feed).  This refers to the "term" attribute of an
   "atom:category" element whose scheme is
   "urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:information-type".  For an Entry,
   this value can be inherited from it's containing Feed as per
   [RFC8322].

3.  Background

   In order to effectively protect and secure an endpoint, it is vital
   to know what the software load of that endpoint is.  Software load,
   the combination of software, patches and installers on a device,
   represents a significant portion of the endpoint's attack surface.
   Unfortunately, without a reliable and secure package manager, or a
   secured and managed operating system with strict software
   whitelisting, tracking what software is installed on an endpoint is
   currently not feasible without undue effort.  Even attempting to
   whitelist software is difficult without a way of identifying software
   and its editions, versions and hotfixes.

   Software descriptor information, such as that standardized in the ISO
   19770-2:2015 Software Identification Tag (SWID) format or expressed
   in proprietary enterprise databases, attempts to provide as much data
   about this software as possible.

   Once this information is expressed, it needs to be stored and shared
   to internal and external parties.  ROLIE provides a mechanism to
   handle this sharing in an automation-friendly way.

4.  The "software-descriptor" information type

   When an "atom:category" element has a "scheme" attribute equal to
   "urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:information-type", the "term"
   attribute defines the information type of the associated resource.  A
   new valid value for this "term": "software-descriptor", is described
   in this section and registered in Section 8.1.  When this value is
   used, the resource in question is considered to have an information-
   type of "software-descriptor" as per [RFC8322] Section 7.1.2.

   The "software-descriptor" information type represents any static
   information that describes a piece of software.  This document uses
   the definition of software provided by [RFC4949].  Note that as per
   this definition, this information type pertains to static software,
   that is, code on the disc.  The "software-descriptor" information
   type is intended to provide a category for information that does one
   or more of the following:

   identifies and characterizes software:  information that provides
      quantative and qualitative data describing software.  This
      information identifies and charaterizes a given instance of
      software.

   provides software installer metadata:  information about software
      used to install other software.  This metadata identifies, and
      characterizes a software installation package or media.

Internet-Draft                ROLIE SWD EXT                    July 2019


   describes stateless installation metadata:  information that
      describes the software post-deployment, such as files that may be
      deployed during an installation.  It is expected that this
      metadata is produced generally for a given installation, and may
      not exactly match the actual installed files on a given endpoint.

   Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of information that may be
   considered to be of a software-descriptor information type.

   o  Naming information: IDs and names that aid in the identification
      of a piece of software

   o  Version and patching information: Version numbers, patch
      identifiers, or other information that relates to software updates
      and patches.

   o  Vendor and source information: Includes where the software was
      developed or distributed, as well as where the software
      installation media may be located.

   o  Payload and file information: information that describes or
      enumerates the files and folders that make up the piece of
      software, and information about those files.

   o  Descriptive information and data: Any information that otherwise
      characterizes a piece of software, such as libraries, runtime
      environments, target operating systems, intended purpose or
      audience, etc.

   It is important to note that software descriptor information is
   static for a given piece of software.  That is, the information
   expressed is the data that doesn't change from the publication of the
   software to its final install.  Information about the current status
   (e.g.  install location, memory usage, CPU usage, launch parameters,
   job progress, etc.), is out of scope of this information type.

5.  rolie:property Extensions

   This document registers new valid rolie:property names as follows:

5.1.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swname

   This property provides an exposure point for the plain text name of
   the software being described.  Naming of software is not a well
   standardized process, and software names can change between product
   versions or editions.  As such, care should be taken that this value
   is set as consistently as possible by generating it directly from an
   attached software descriptor resource.

Internet-Draft                ROLIE SWD EXT                    July 2019


5.2.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swversion

   This property provides an exposure point for the version of the
   software being described.  This value should be generated or taken
   from the software descriptor linked to by the entry.  This helps
   avoid, but does not prevent, inconsistent versioning schemes being
   shared.

5.3.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swcreator

   This property provides an exposure point for a plain text name of the
   creator of the software being described.  This is in many cases an
   organization or company, but certainly could be a single person.
   Most software descriptor formats include this information, and where
   possible, this property should be set equal to that value.

6.  Data format requirements

   This section defines usage guidance and additional requirements
   related to data formats above and beyond those specified in
   [RFC8322].  The following formats are expected to be commonly used to
   express software descriptor information.  For this reason, this
   document specifies additional requirements to ensure
   interoperability.

6.1.  The ISO SWID 2015 format

6.1.1.  Description

   ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 defines a software record data format referred
   to as a "SWID Tag".  It provides several tag types:

   o  primary: provides descriptive and naming information about
      software,

   o  patch: describes non-standalone software meant to patch existing
      software,

   o  corpus: describes the software installation media that installs a
      given piece of software,

   o  supplemental: provides additional metadata to be deployed
      alongside a tag.

   For a more complete overview as well as normative requirements, refer
   to ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 [SWID].

Internet-Draft                ROLIE SWD EXT                    July 2019


   For additional requirements and guidance around creation of SWID
   Tags, consult NIST Internal Report 8060 [NISTIR8060].

6.1.2.  Requirements

   For an Entry to be considered as a "SWID Tag Entry", it MUST fulfill
   the following conditions:

   o  The information-type of the Entry is "software-descriptor".  For a
      typical Entry, this is derived from the information type of the
      Feed it is contained in.  For a standalone Entry, this is provided
      by an "atom:category" element.

   o  The document linked to by the "href" attribute of the
      "atom:content" element is a 2015 SWID Tag per ISO/IEC
      19770-2:2015.

   A "SWID Tag Entry" MUST conform to the following requirements:

   o  The value of the "type" attribute of the "atom:content" element
      MUST be "application/xml".

   o  There MUST be one "rolie:property" with the "name" attribute equal
      to "urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:content-id" and the "value"
      attribute exactly equal to the "<tagid>" element in the attached
      SWID Tag. This allows ROLIE consumers to more easily search for
      SWID tags without needing to download the tag itself.

   o  There MUST be one "rolie:property" with the "name" attribute equal
      to "urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swname", and the "value"
      attribute equal to the value of the "<name>" element in the
      attached SWID Tag. As above, this helps ROLIE consumers search and
      filter Entries.

   o  There MAY be a property element with the "name" attribute equal to
      "urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swversion".  When this
      property appears, its value MUST be equal to the value of the
      "version" element in the attached SWID Tag.

6.2.  The Concise SWID format

6.2.1.  Description

   The Concise SWID (COSWID) format is an alternative representation of
   the SWID Tag format using a Concise Binary Object Representation
   (CBOR) encoding.  CBOR provides the format with a reduced size that
   is more suitable for constrained devices.  COSWID provides the same
   features and attributes as are specified in ISO 19770-2:2015, plus:

   o  a straight forward method to sign and encrypt using COSE, and

   o  additional attributes that provide an improved structure to
      include file hashes intended to be used as Reference Integrity
      Measurements (RIM).

   For more information and the complete specification, refer to the
   COSWID internet draft [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid].

6.2.2.  Requirements

   For an Entry to be considered as a "COSWID Tag Entry", it MUST
   fulfill the following conditions:

   o  The information-type of the Entry is "software-descriptor".  For a
      typical Entry, this is derived from the information-type of the
      Feed it is contained in.  For a standalone Entry, this is provided
      by an "atom:category" element.

   o  The document linked to by the "href" attribute of the
      "atom:content" element is a COSWID Tag per [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid]

   A "COSWID Tag Entry" MUST conform to the following requirements:

   o  The value of the "type" attribute of the atom:content element MUST
      be "application/swid+cbor".

   o  There MUST be one "rolie:property" with the "name" attribute equal
      to "urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:content-id" and the "value"
      attribute exactly equal to the decoded "tag-id" element in the
      attached COSWID Tag (mapped to integer 0).  This allows ROLIE
      consumers to more easily search for COSWID tags without needing to
      download the tag itself.

   o  There MUST be one "rolie:property" with the "name" attribute equal
      to "urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swname", and the "value"
      attribute equal to the decoded value of the "swid-name" element in
      the attached COSWID Tag (mapped to the integer 1).  As above, this
      helps ROLIE consumers search and filter Entries.

   o  There MAY be a property element with the "name" attribute equal to
      "urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swversion".  When this
      property appears, it's value MUST be equal to the decoded value of
      the tag-version element in the attached COSWID Tag (mapped to the
      integer 12).

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE Security Resource Information
   Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type> .

   The entry is as follows:

      name: software-descriptor

      index: TBD

      reference: This document, Section 4

8.2.  swd:swname property

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE URN Parameters" registry
   located in <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/>.

   The entry is as follows:

      name: property:swd:swname

      Subregistry: None

8.4.  swd:swcreator property

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE URN Parameters" registry
   located in <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/>.

   The entry is as follows:

      name: property:swd:swcreator

      Extension IRI: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:swd:swcreator

      Reference: This document, Section 5.1

      Subregistry: None

9.  Security Considerations

   Use of this extension implies dealing with the security implications
   of both ROLIE and of software descriptors in general.  As with any
   data, care should be taken to verify the trustworthiness and veracity
   of the descriptor information to the fullest extent possible.

   Ideally, software descriptors should be signed by the software
   manufacturer, or signed by whichever agent processed the source code.
   Software descriptor documents from these sources are more likely to
   be accurate than those generated by scraping installed software.

   These "authoritative" sources of software descriptor content should
   consider additional security for their ROLIE repository beyond the
   typical recommendations, as the central importance of the repository
   is likely to make it a target.

   Version information is often represented differently across
   manufacturers and even across product releases.  If using software
   version information for low fault tolerance comparisons and searches,
   care should be taken that the correct version scheme is being used.

Appendix B.  Examples of Use

   Use of this extension in a ROLIE repository will not typically change
   that repository's operation.  As such, the general examples provided
   by the ROLIE core document would serve as examples.  Provided below
   is a sample software descriptor ROLIE entry:
