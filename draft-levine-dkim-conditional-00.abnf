cs=  A list of condition strings, each identifying a condition that
      must be satisfied for the signature to be valid.  The initial list
      of condition strings is described below, and placed in the new
      DKIM-Signature Condition String registry.  A verifier MUST check
      that the condition for each condition string is satisfied.  If any
      of the conditions are not satisfied, or any of the condition
      strings are unknown to the verifier, it MUST report that the
      signature is not valid.

fs=  A list of forwarding signers.  A forwarding signer is a domain
      name, or the letter "t" meaning any of the domain names in
      addresses in the To header field, or the letter "c" meaning any of
      the domain names in addresses in the Cc header field.  If the tag
      includes "t" or "c", the signature SHOULD include the To or Cc
      header field, respectively.
