   this document is to help the IETF community understand what SIP-
   unfriendly functions can be found in existing networks so that the
   appropriate working groups can decide whether or not new standard
   solutions need to be developed to provide such functionality (or a
   subset of it) in a standard, SIP-friendly way.  Working groups may
   also develop recommendations on how to use existing standard
   mechanisms to provide such functionality.  An additional goal of this
   document is to describe how implementing certain functions in certain
   ways breaks SIP and the disadvantages derived from doing so.

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document gives an overview to SIP [1] unfriendly functions in
   current communication architectures.  These functions are generally
   implemented in Session Border Controllers (SBCs).  The reason for
   this is that network policies are typically enforced at the edge of
   the network, and SBCs are typically located there.

   Of course, a typical SBC does not only implement SIP-unfriendly
   functions.  They usually implement a set of functions, some of which
   are perfectly legal from the SIP point of view.  However, this
   document focuses on those functions that break SIP somehow.

   Many existing SBCs use proprietary solutions because there is no
   standard solution for a given issue or because the standard solution
   does not fully meet the requirements of the network operator.  This
   document is intended to be taken as input by the IETF so that the
   appropriate working groups can decide whether or not new standard
   solutions need to be developed to provide the same functionality (or
   a subset of it) in a SIP-friendly way.  Working groups may also
   decide to develop recommendations on how to use existing standard
   mechanisms to provide such functionality.


2.  Background on SBCs

   The term SBC is pretty vague, since it is not standardized or defined
   anywhere.  Nodes that may be referred to as SBCs but do not implement
   SIP are outside the scope of this document.

   Even though many SBCs currently break things like end-to-end security
   and can impact feature negotiations, there is clearly a market for
   them.  Network operators need many of the features current SBCs
   provide and many times there are no standard mechanisms available to
   provide them in a better way.

   SIP-based SBCs typically handle both signaling and media, and often
   modify the session descriptions contained in SIP messages.
   Consequently, they are, by definition, B2BUAs (Back-to-Back User
   Agents).  The transparency of these B2BUAs varies depending on the
   functions they perform.  For example, some SBCs modify the session
   description carried in the message and insert a Record-Route entry.
   Other SBCs replace the value of the Contact header field with the
   SBCs address, and generate a new Call-ID and new To and From tags.

   Figure 1: SBC architecture

   Figure 1 shows the logical architecture of an SBC, which includes a
   signaling and a media component.  Typically SBCs are located between
   two networks.  In this document, the terms outer and inner network
   are used for describing these two networks.

   There are two typical deployment scenarios where SBCs are used.  The
   first one of them is a peering scenario, where the SBC is located
   between different-operators' networks.  The second deployment
   scenario is an access scenario, where the SBC is located between the
   access network and the operator's network.


3.  SIP-Unfriendly Functions

   This section examines SIP-unfriendly functions that are used in
   current communication networks.  Each subsection describes a
   particular function or feature, what is the operator's motivation for
   having it, explanation on why it breaks SIP, and a concrete example
   from its implementation.  Each section also discusses problems
   specific to that particular way of implementing it.  Providing
   suggestions for alternative, more SIP-friendly ways of implementing
   each of the functions is outside the scope of this document.

   All the examples given in this section are somewhat simplified
   situations from the reality.  Only the relevant header lines from SIP
   and SDP [3] messages are displayed.

3.1.  Topology Hiding

3.1.1.  General Information

   Topology hiding consists of limiting the amount of topology
   information given to external parties.  Operators want to have this
   functionality because they do not want the IP addresses of their
   equipment (proxies, gateways, application servers, etc) to be exposed



Hautakorpi, et al.       Expires March 30, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


   to outside parties.  This may be because they do not want to expose
   their equipment to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks or because they
   may use other carriers for certain traffic and do not want their
   customers to be aware of it.  In some environments, the operator's
   customers may wish to hide the addresses of their equipment or the
   SIP messages may contain private, non-routable addresses.

3.1.2.  SIP-Unfriendly Aspect

   This functionality is SIP-unfriendly, because it breaks end-to-end
   connectivity and modifies the SIP messages without user's explicit
   consent.  User does not have any way of knowing whether the SIP
   messages are modified by the SBC, or is someone performing MitM (Man-
   in-the-Middle) attack.

3.1.3.  Concrete Example

   The current way of implementing topology consists of having an SBC
   act as a B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agents) and remove all traces of
   topology information (e.g., Record-Route and Vie entries) from
   outgoing messages.

   Like a regular proxy server that inserts a Record-Route entry, the
   SBC handles every single message of a given SIP dialog.  However,
   unlike the proxy server, if the SBC loses state (e.g., the SBC
   restarts for some reason), it will not be able to route messages
   properly.  For example, if the SBC removes Via entries from a request
   and then restarts losing state, the SBC will not be able to route
   responses to that request.

   Let us imagine the following example scenario: The SBC
   (p4.domain.com) is receiving an INVITE request from the inner
   network, which in this case is an operator network.  The received SIP
   message is:


     INVITE sip:callee@u2.domain.com SIP/2.0
     Contact: sip:caller@u1.example.com
     Record-Route: <sip:p3.middle.com>
     Record-Route: <sip:p2.example.com;lr>
     Record-Route: <sip:p1.example.com;lr>

   Then the SBC performs a topology hiding function.  In this imagined
   situation the SBC removes and stores all existing Record-Route
   headers, and then insert a Record-Route header field with its own
   SIP-URI.  After the topology hiding function, the message looks like:





Hautakorpi, et al.       Expires March 30, 2006                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


     INVITE sip:callee@u2.domain.com SIP/2.0
     Contact: sip:caller@u1.example.com
     Record-Route: <sip:p4.domain.com;lr>

   This is only one example scenario from topology hiding, and SBCs can,
   in some cases, modify also other headers.

3.2.  Media Traffic Shaping

3.2.1.  General Information

   Media traffic shaping is the act of controlling media traffic.
   Operators have several reasons for having this functionality.
   Operators want to control the traffic they carry on their network.
   Traffic shaping helps them create different kinds of billing models
   (e.g., video telephony can be priced differently than voice-only
   calls).  Additionally, traffic shaping can be used to implement
   intercept capabilities (e.g., lawful intercept).

   Some operators do not actually want to reshape the traffic, but only
   to monitor it.  However, the SIP techniques needed for monitoring
   media traffic are the same as for reshaping media traffic.

   One possible form of media traffic shaping is that SBCs terminate
   media streams and SIP dialogs by generating BYE requests.  This kind
   of procedure can take place e.g., in a situation where subscriber
   runs out of credits.

3.2.2.  SIP-Unfriendly Aspect

   The current way of implementing traffic shaping has some SIP-
   unfriendly aspects.  The SBC needs to access and modify the session
   descriptions (i.e., offers and answers) exchanged between the user
   agents.  Consequently, this approach does not work if user agents
   encrypt or integrity-protect their message bodies end-to-end.  User
   agents do not have any way to distinguish the SBC actions from an
   attack by a MitM (Man-in-the-Middle).

3.2.3.  Concrete Example

   Currently, traffic shaping is performed in the following way.  The
   SBC behaves as a B2BUA and inserts itself, or some other entity under
   the operator's control, in the media path.  In practice, the SBC
   modifies the session descriptions carried in the SIP messages.  As a
   result, the SBC receives media from one user agent and relays it to
   the other in both directions.

   An example of traffic shaping is codec restriction.  The SBC



Hautakorpi, et al.       Expires March 30, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


   restricts the codec set negotiated in offer/answer [2] exchange
   between the user agents.  After modifying the session descriptions,
   the SBC can check whether or not the media stream corresponds to what
   was negotiated in the offer/answer exchange.  If it differs, the SBC
   has the ability to terminate the media stream.

   Let us imagine the following example scenario: The SBC is receiving
   an INVITE request from the outer network, which in this case is an
   access network.  The received SIP message contains the following SDP
   session descriptor:


     v=0
     o=mhandley 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     c=IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96 98
     a=rtpmap:96 L8/8000
     a=rtpmap:98 L16/16000/2

   Then the SBC performs a media traffic shaping function.  In this
   imagined situation the SBC rewrites the 'm' line, and removes one 'a'
   line according to some policy.  After the traffic shaping function,
   the session descriptor looks like:


     v=0
     o=mhandley 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     c=IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 L8/8000

   One problem of media traffic shaping is that the SBC needs to
   understand the session description protocol and all the extensions
   used by the user agents.  This means that in order to use a new
   extension (e.g., an extension to implement a new service) or a new
   session description protocol, it is not enough with upgrading the
   user agents; SBCs in the network need also to be upgraded.  This fact
   may slow down service innovation.

3.3.  Fixing Capability Mismatches

3.3.1.  General Information

   SBCs fixing capability mismatches enable communications between user
   agents with different capabilities.  For example, user agents that
   support different IP versions, different codecs, or that are in
   different address realms.




Hautakorpi, et al.       Expires March 30, 2006                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


3.3.2.  SIP-Unfriendly Aspect

   SBCs fixing capability mismatches insert a media element in the media
   path using the procedures described in Section 3.2.  Therefore, these
   SBCs have the same problems as SBCs performing traffic shaping: the
   SBC modifies SIP messages without explicit consent from any of the
   user agents.  This breaks end-to-end security and extension
   negotiation.

   Additionally, SBCs may make wrong assumptions about the capabilities
   of the user agents.  When this happens, user agents with compatible
   capabilities may end up communicating via the SBC instead of doing it
   directly between them (e.g., the SBC assumes that a dual-stack user
   agent only supports IPv6).

3.3.3.  Concrete Example

   Let us imagine the following example scenario: The SBC is receiving
   an INVITE request from the inner network, which in this case is an
   access network using IPv4.  The received SIP message and session
   descriptor is the following:


     INVITE sip:callee@ipv6.domain.com SIP/2.0
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 126.16.64.4
     Contact: sip:caller@u1.example.com

     v=0
     o=mhandley 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     c=IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 L8/8000

   Then the SBC performs a capability mismatch fixing function.  In this
   imagined situation the SBC inserts Record-Route and Via headers, and
   rewrites the 'c' line from the sessions descriptor.  After the
   capability mismatch fixing function, the message look like:

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


     INVITE sip:callee@ipv6.domain.com SIP/2.0
     Record-Route: <sip:[2001:620:8:801:201:2ff:fe94:8e10];lr>
     Via: <sip:[2001:620:8:801:201:2ff:fe94:8e10];lr>
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 126.16.64.4
     Contact: sip:caller@u1.example.com

     v=0
     o=mhandley 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
     c=IN IP6 2001:620:8:801:201:2ff:fe94:8e10
     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 L8/8000

   Now the SBC sends the modified message to the outer network, which
   uses IPv6.

3.4.  NAT Traversal

3.4.1.  General Information

   An SBC performing a NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal
   function for a user agent behind a NAT sits between the user agent
   and the registrar of the domain.  When the registrar receives a
   REGISTER request from the user agent and responds with a 200 (OK)
   response, the SBC modifies such a response decreasing the validity of
   the registration (i.e., the registration expires sooner).  This
   forces the user agent to send a new REGISTER to refresh the
   registration sooner that it would have done on receiving the original
   response from the registrar.  The REGISTER requests sent by the user
   agent refresh the binding of the NAT before the binding expires.

   Note that the SBC does not need to relay all the REGISTER requests
   received from the user agent to the registrar.  The SBC can generate
   responses to REGISTER requests received before the registration is
   about to expire at the registrar.  Moreover, the SBC needs to
   deregister the user agent if this fails to refresh its registration
   in time, even if the registration at the registrar would still be
   valid.

   Operators implement this functionality in an SBC instead of in the
   registrar because the SBC is supposed to have more information about
   the access the user agent is using.  Additionally, distributing this
   functionality helps offload the registrar.

3.4.2.  SIP-Unfriendly Aspect

   This approach to NAT traversal does not work when end-to-end
   confidentiality or integrity-protection is used.  The SBC would be
   seen as a MitM modifying the messages between the user agent and the



Hautakorpi, et al.       Expires March 30, 2006                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          SIP-Unfriendly Functions          September 2005


   registrar.

3.4.3.  Concrete Example

   Let us imagine the following example scenario: The SBC resides
   between the UA and Registrar.  Previously the UA has sent a REGISTER
   request to Registrar, and then the SBC is going to relay the
   following SIP message to UA:


     SIP/2.0 200 OK
     From: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.example.com>;tag=a73kszlfl
     To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.example.com>;tag=34095828jh
     CSeq: 1 REGISTER
     Contact: <sips:bob@client.biloxi.example.com>;expires=3600

   Then the SBC performs a traversal function.  In this imagined
   situation the SBC rewrites the 'expires' parameter on the Contact
   header field.  After the NAT traversal function, the message look
   like:


     SIP/2.0 200 OK
     From: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.example.com>;tag=a73kszlfl
     To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.example.com>;tag=34095828jh
     CSeq: 1 REGISTER
     Contact: <sips:bob@client.biloxi.example.com>;expires=60

   Naturally also other measures needs to be taken in order to enable
   the NAT traversal, but this example illustrated only the mechanism on
   how NAT bindings can be kept alive.


4.  Security Considerations

   Many of the functions this document describes have important security
   and privacy implications.  If the IETF decides to develop standard
   mechanisms to address those functions, security and privacy-related
   aspects will need to be taken into consideration.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
