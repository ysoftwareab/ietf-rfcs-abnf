 Fast Failover in Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
 Using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multipoint Networks
                  draft-ietf-pim-bfd-p2mp-use-case-07

Abstract

   This document specifies how Bidirectional Forwarding Detection for
   multipoint networks can provide sub-second failover for routers that
   participate in Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).
   An extension to the PIM Hello message used to bootstrap a point-to-
   multipoint BFD session is also defined in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Faster convergence in the control plane, in general, is beneficial
   and allows minimizing periods of traffic blackholing, transient
   routing loops, and other scenarios that may negatively affect service
   data flow.  That equally applies to unicast and multicast routing
   protocols.

   [RFC7761] is the current specification of the Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  A
   conforming implementation of PIM-SM elects a Designated Router (DR)
   on each PIM-SM interface.  When a group of PIM-SM nodes is connected
   to a shared media segment, e.g., Ethernet, the node elected as DR is
   to act on behalf of directly connected hosts in the context of the
   PIM-SM protocol.  Failure of the DR impacts the quality of the
   multicast services it provides to directly connected hosts because
   the default failure detection interval for PIM-SM routers is 105
   seconds.

Internet-Draft           BFD P2MP Use in PIM-SM           September 2021


   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] had been
   originally defined to detect a failure of point-to-point (p2p) paths
   - single-hop [RFC5881], multihop [RFC5883].  In some PIM-SM
   deployments, a p2p BFD can detect a failure and enable faster
   failover.  [RFC8562] extends the BFD base specification [RFC5880] for
   multipoint and multicast networks precisely characterizes deployment
   scenarios for PIM-SM over a LAN segment.  Among specific
   characteristics of p2mp BFD that particularly benefit PIM-SM over a
   LAN segment is a faster transition to the Up state of the p2mp BFD
   session due to avoidance of the three-way handshake required in p2p
   BFD [RFC5880].  Also, because the router that transmits BFD Control
   messages uses the BFD Demand mode [RFC5880], it maintains less BFD
   state than the Asynchronous mode.  Point-to-multipoint (p2mp) BFD can
   enable faster detection of PIM-SM router failure and thus minimize
   multicast service disruption.  The monitored PIM-SM router acts as
   the head and other routers as tails of a p2mp BFD session.  This
   document defines the monitoring of a PIM-SM router using p2mp BFD.
   The document also defines the extension to PIM-SM [RFC7761] to
   bootstrap a PIM-SM router to join in p2mp BFD session over shared
   media segment.

1.1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC5880], [RFC8562], and
   [RFC7761]. familiarity with these specifications and the terminology
   used is expected.

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Figure 1 displays the new optional BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option
   to bootstrap a tail of the p2mp BFD session.

                Figure 1: BFD Discriminator PIM Hello Option

   where new fields are interpreted as:

      OptionType: TBA.

      OptionLength: MUST be set to 4.

      My Discriminator: My Discriminator ([RFC5880]) value allocated by
      the head.

   If the value of the OptionLength field is not equal to 4, the BFD
   Discriminator PIM Hello option is considered malformed, and the
   receiver MUST stop processing PIM Hello options.  If the value of the
   My Discriminator field equals zero, then the BFD Discriminator PIM
   Hello option MUST be considered invalid, and the receiver MUST ignore
   it.  The receiver SHOULD log a notification regarding the malformed
   or invalid BFD Discriminator Hello option under the control of a
   throttling logging mechanism.

2.1.  Using P2MP BFD in PIM Router Monitoring

   The head MUST create a BFD session of type MultipointHead [RFC8562].
   Note that any PIM-SM router, regardless of its role, MAY become a
   head of a p2mp BFD session.  To control the volume of BFD control
   traffic on a shared media segment, an operator should carefully
   select PIM-SM routers configured as a head of a p2mp BFD session.
   The head MUST include the BFD Discriminator option in its Hello
   messages.

   If a PIM-SM router is configured to monitor the head by using p2mp
   BFD, referred to through this document as 'tail', receives a PIM-
   Hello packet with the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option, the tail
   MAY create a p2mp BFD session of type MultipointTail, as defined in
   [RFC8562].

   The node that includes the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option
   transmits BFD Control packets periodically.  For the tail to
   correctly demultiplex BFD [RFC8562], the source address, and My
   Discriminator values of the BFD packets MUST be the same as those

   used in the PIM Hello message.  If that is not the case, the tail BFD
   node would not be able to monitor the state of the PIM-SM node, that
   is, the head of the p2mp BFD session, though the regular PIM-SM
   mechanisms remain fully operational.

   If the tail detects a MultipointHead failure [RFC8562], it MUST
   delete the corresponding neighbor state and follow procedures defined
   in [RFC7761].

   If the head ceases to include the BFD Discriminator PIM Hello option
   in its PIM-Hello message, tails MUST close the corresponding
   MultipointTail BFD session without affecting the PIM state in any
   way.  Thus the tail stops using BFD to monitor the head and reverts
   to the procedures defined in [RFC7761].

2.2.  P2MP BFD in PIM DR Load Balancing

   [RFC8775] specifies the PIM Designated Router Load Balancing (DRLB)
   functionality.  Any PIM router that advertises the DRLB-Cap Hello
   Option can become the head of a p2mp BFD session, as specified in
   Section 2.1.  The head router administratively sets the
   bfd.SessionState to Up in the MultipointHead session [RFC8562] only
   if it is a Group Designated Router (GDR) Candidate, as specified in
   Sections 5.5 and 5.6 of [RFC8775].  If the router is no longer the
   GDR, then it MUST shut down following the procedures described in
   Section 5.9 [RFC8562].  For each GDR Candidate that includes BFD
   Discriminator option in its PIM Hello, the PIM DR creates a
   MultipointTail session [RFC8562].  PIM DR demultiplexes BFD sessions
   based on the value of the My Discriminator field and the source IP
   address.  If PIM DR detects a failure of one of the sessions, it MUST
   remove that router from the GDR Candidate list and immediately
   transmit a new DRLB-List option.

2.3.  Multipoint BFD Encapsulation

   The MultipointHead of a p2mp BFD session when transmitting BFD
   Control packets:

      must set TTL or Hop Limit value to 255 (Section 5 [RFC5881]);

      MUST use the group address ALL-PIM-ROUTERS ('224.0.0.13' for IPv4
      and 'ff02::d' for IPv6) as destination IP address

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new OptionType value from PIM-Hello
   Options registry according to:
