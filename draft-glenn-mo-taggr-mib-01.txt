Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it is used to configure an agent to aggregate values
   of a (user) specified MO instance sampled at (user) specified intervals
   for a (user) specified number of times and to service queries related
   to the aggregated MOs.

Internet Draft                                         December 16, 2002


1.  Introduction.

   For the purpose of management it is necessary to access Managed
   Objects (MOs). The SNMP framework provides a mechanism for naming and
   describing managed objects.  These objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, the Management Information Base (MIB). MIBs have
   been defined by equipment, protocol and, application developers to
   provide management access to the managed entities. We will call the
   MOs defined in these MIBs - simple MOs (SMO). Management applications
   will access one or more of these MOs, one or more times, to monitor
   the target entity.

   There is a cost associated with polling. The cost is the network
   bandwidth and the packet header processing overhead at the command
   generator (manager) and the command responder (agent). This cost
   constrains the number of objects that can be polled and the interval
   at which polling can be carried out.

   The overhead reduction can be carried out by reducing the number of
   query-response packets. This will reduce the packet processing
   overhead and to some extent the bandwidth.

   The payloads in a typical SNMP "get" packet and the corresponding
   response are as shown in Fig. 1. In the example shown in the figure
   polling is carried out for 'n' Managed Objects (MOs) OID1, OID2, ..,
   OIDn. It is obvious that a substantial amount of the payload in an
   SNMP packet consists of the OIDs. In [ODC-Dft] OID compression has
   been proposed by using the OID Delta Compression mechanism.

   In a companion draft [Aggr-Dft] a mechanism of MO aggregation for
   payload compression is outlined. In this  mechanism the user defines
   an Aggregate MO (AgMO) corresponding to one or more (predefined) MOs.
   Semantically, the AgMO will be equivalent to the concatenation of the
   values of the specified MOs. With the definitions done, the user can,
   as and when the necessity arises, perform an SNMP "get" on instances
   of the AgMO to fetch the value of instances of the constituent MOs.
   There is substantial savings on bandwidth as only one instance object
   identifier is carried in the request and the response. In the normal
   case, instance object identifiers for each of the constituent MO
   instances would be carried in the requests and the response.

   In this draft we propose a further refinement of the AgMO. We
   introduce the Time-based Aggregated Managed Object (TAgMO).  The
   TAgMO is an MO that represents the values of a (user) specified MO
   sampled at (user) specified intervals for a (user) specified number
   of times.  In this case the user defines a TAgMO by specifying the MO
   instance that needs to be sampled, the sampling interval and the
   desired number of samples that will be included in one TAgMO. The

   value of a TAgMO instance will include the timestamp (sysuptime) at
   which the first sample was taken.  With the definitions done the user
   can do an SNMP "get" on an instance of the TAgMO to fetch the values
   of the constituent MO instance sampled at the specified intervals.
   This is the concept of time-based agregation.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC xxxx [RFCxxxx].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  The Requirements for Managed Object aggregation

   The general requirements of managed object aggregation are as
   follows:

          o It should lead to lesser number of packets
          o It should lead to lesser bandwidth consumption
          o It should not lead to loss of information

   In case of time-based aggregation  there may be a delay involved in
   getting the actual data. The minimum delay in this case will be the
   duration of the aggregation.

   The manager application is expected to configure aggregate MOs with
   care so that the response size is not too large. In case the
   resultant response size is larger than the maximum acceptable message
   size of the originator or larger than the local maximum message size
   then the error-status field will be set to "tooBig".

4.  MIB Design.

The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as  possible and
at the same time to make it flexible enough so that a large number of
users and applications can use the MIB to configure aggregate MOs
conveniently.

The MIB comprises of two tables described below.
    - The tAggrCtlTable controls the aggregation process. Each row in
      this table defines the attributes of aggregate object defined in
      the aggrMOTable.

    - The tAggrDataTable contains the details of the aggregated object
      The size of the table may be decided by implementations.

               instance (starting at 1) in the value of the time aggregated
               MO instance.
             o the moError which indicates the error that was encountered

Security Considerations

   There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and read-create. There is the risk that
   an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   via direct SNMP SET operations. So, care must be taken to put in place
   the security provisions of SNMP for authentication and access control.
   Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) and SET (write) the objects in this MIB.

   It is strongly recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [RFC2274] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [RFC2275] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
