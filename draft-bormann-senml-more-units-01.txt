Abstract

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the
   indication of units for a quantity represented.  This short document
   registers a number of additional unit names in the IANA registry for
   Units in SenML.  It also defines a registry for derived units that
   cannot be in SenML's main registry.

1.  Introduction

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML, [RFC8428]) media type supports
   the indication of a unit, using the SenML field "u", for the quantity
   given as a data value in a SenML record.  For this purpose, SenML
   defines an IANA registry of defined Unit names and their meanings.

   This short document registers a number of additional units in the
   IANA registry for Units in SenML that appear to be necessary for
   further adopting SenML in other Standards Development Organizations
   (SDOs).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  New Units

   IANA is requested to assign new units in the "SenML Units"
   subregistry of the SenML registry [IANA.senml] (as defined in
   [RFC8428]):

3.  Rationale

   SenML [RFC8428] takes the position that unscaled SI units should
   always be used.  However, SenML makes one exception: The degree
   Celsius (as Cel) is allowed as an alternative to the K (Kelvin).

   This document takes the position that the same should apply to a
   small number of alternative units in wide use:

   o  The Byte.  [IEC-80000-13] defines both the bit (item 13-9.b) and
      the byte (item 13-9.c, also called octet) as alternative names for
      the coherent unit one for the purpose of giving storage capacity
      and related quantities.  While the name octet is associated with
      the symbol o, this is in wide use only in French-speaking
      countries.  Globally more wide-spread is the symbol B for byte,
      even though B is already taken in SI for bel.  [RFC8428] therefore
      registers dB as the SenML unit for logarithmic relative power,
      leaving B free for the usage proposed here.  While this is
      potentially confusing, the situation is widely understood in
      engineering circles and is unlikely to cause actual problems.

   o  The Volt-Ampere.  [IEC-80000-6]} item 6-57.a defines the VA (volt
      ampere) as a unit for apparent power; items 6-59.a, 6-60.a and
      6-61.a also use the unit for complex, reactive, and non-active
      power.

   o  The Volt-Ampere-reactive.  [IEC-80000-6] item 6-60.b defines the
      var (volt ampere reactive) as an alternative (and fully
      equivalent) unit to VA specifically for reactive power (with the
      primary unit VA).  It is not presently known to this author how

      the upcoming revision of IEC 80000-6 will update this, but it has
      became clear since that there is strong interest in using this
      unit specifically for the imaginary content of complex power,
      reactive power [IEEE-1459].

   The unit "degrees" is unit in wide use in practice for plane angle
   (as in heading, bearing, etc.).  It is marked with an asterisk
   because the preferred coherent SI unit is radian ("rad").

   The Joule per meter is not a traditional electromagnetic unit.  It
   and its scaled derivatives (in particular Wh/km) are used to describe
   the energy expended for achieving motion over a given distance, e.g.
   as an equivalent for electrical cars of the inverse of "mileage".

4.  New Registry

   IANA is requested to create a "scaled units" subregistry in the SenML
   registry [IANA.senml] defined in [RFC8428].

   The registry has four columns:

   o  scaled unit: a newly registered name allocated within the same
      namespace as SenML units

   o  SenML unit: an existing SenML unit from the SenML units registry

   o  scale, offset: two rational numbers, expressed in decimal or as a
      fraction divided by a "/" character.

   Quantities expressed in the derived unit can be converted into the
   SenML unit by first multiplying their value with the scale number and
   then adding the offset, yielding the value in the given SenML unit.

              +-------------+------------+--------+--------+
              | scaled unit | SenML unit | scale  | offset |
              +-------------+------------+--------+--------+
              | ms          | s          | 1/1000 | 0      |
              |             |            |        |        |
              | km          | m          | 1000   | 0      |
              |             |            |        |        |
              | dBm         | dBW        | 1      | -30    |
              +-------------+------------+--------+--------+

   Example: the value of a quantity given as 100 ms is first multiplied
   by 1/1000, yielding the number 0.1, and then the offset 0 is added,
   yielding the number 0.1 again, leading to a quantity of 0.1 s.

   New entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as
   defined in [RFC8126].  Experts should exercise their own good
   judgment, with the same guidelines as used for SenML units
   (Section 12.1 of [RFC8428]), but without applying the rules 4 and 5.

   SenML packs MAY, but SHOULD NOT use scaled units in place of SenML
   units, except in the context of specific data models that are based
   on these scaled units.

   [So does this spec update RFC 8428?]

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8428] apply.  The introduction of
   new measurement units poses no additional security considerations
   except from a possible potential for additional confusion about the
   proper unit to use.

6.  IANA Considerations

   See Section 2 and Section 4.
