1.  Introduction

   The Numbering Exchange Protocol (NEP) is an Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP), delivering IP packets between routers in the same
   Autonomous System (AS).

   Many routing protocols, such as RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and EIGRP, use
   normally one or even zero metrics each:

      a. RIP uses only the number of hops.
      b. OSPF uses only the cost (bandwidth).
      c. IS-IS uses only a default metric of 10 for all links.
      d. EIGRP uses the least bandwidth and delay.

   NEP differs from other IGPs as it chooses its best path based on a
   composite metric of:

      a. Highest total bandwidth (for faster transmission).
      b. Number of hops (for less processing).
      c. Lowest total delay (for faster delivery).

   NEP uses a numbering method between routers that provides a fast
   topology exchange and learning process, and builds a routing table
   shorter than those that other IGPs build.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119, RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Links have two numeric values: the upper value represents the link
   delay, and the lower value represents the link bandwidth.
 
   Each NEP router advertises the topology information as follows (the
   over-the-wire format is described in Appendix A.1 and A.2):

     a: rh, b, d

     a - advertising router RID.
     r - destination router RID.
     h - number of hops.
     b - total bandwidth.
     d - total delay.

   Each router within an Autonomous System (AS) must be configured with
   a unique number called Router ID (RID).
   
   The RID is a 32-bit decimal number that uniquely identifies a router
   within an AS.

   Each router advertises its RID first to its neighboring routers using
   Hello messages.

   Each router advertises all the interconnected RIDs, total bandwidth,
   number of hops, and total delay to the neighboring router.

   Each router calculates the best path to each router using the
   following values:

      a. Total bandwidth.
      b. Number of hops.
      c. Total delay.
   
   The best NEP path from the local router to every other router from
   the collected advertised information has the following:

      a. Highest total bandwidth.
      b. Lowest number of hops that corresponds to the highest
         total bandwidth.
      c. Lowest total delay.

   The NEP metric is calculated using the following formula:

           ****************************************************
           *             (No. of Hops * Total-Delay)          *
           *  Metric = [-----------------------------] x 10^7 * 
           *                    Total-BW                      *
           ****************************************************                  

   The best metric has the lowest value.

Internet-Draft    Numbering Exchange Protocol (NEP)         January 2018

   Each NEP router sends an Echo message of each of its interface to the
   neighboring router, the time taken by the message to be sent and 
   received over the link divided by 2 determines the link delay.

   The Echo message is sent by every router every 10 seconds
   (by default).

   The link delay value is updated every 10 seconds on every advertised
   message that contains the 3 values that can be used to determine the
   best path from the NEP router to other routers.

3. NEP Loop Prevention

   NEP uses a loop free mechanism by discarding the advertised topology
   information that has a higher metric than the existing stored entry
   for the same RID to prevent looping.

   When an NEP router receives an advertised topology information to a
   specific router, it checks its own topology table, if there is no
   entry listed for that RID contained in the advertised message, it
   adds it to its own topology table.

   If more than one message received to the same RID, the NEP router
   calculates the metric for each one of them and store the one with the
   lowest metric for that router.

   For example:

      a) Router 1 will have 3 messages to the destination router 4 as
      follows:

          2: 42, 4000, 50 ==> Metric = 250,000     (discarded)
          3: 42, 3000, 30 ==> Metric = 200,000     (added)
          5: 42, 3100, 210 ==> Metric = 1,354,839  (discarded)

      The message from router 3 has the lowest metric to the destination
      router 4 so this route through router 3 will be added to the
      routing table and other routes will be discarded.

      b) Router 1 will have 3 messages to the destination router 6 as
      follows:

          2: 63, 9000, 120 ==> Metric = 400,000    (discarded)
          3: 63, 8000, 100 ==> Metric = 375,000    (added)
          5: 63, 8100, 280 ==> Metric = 1,037,037  (discarded)

      The message from router 2 has the lowest metric to the destination
      router 6 so this route through router 2 will be added to the
      routing table and other routes will be discarded.

   ***************************************************************

   Note: In case of two or more equal metrics for the same destination,
   the routes are added to the routing table and traffic is balanced
   between these routes.

4. Subnet Advertisement

    After learning the best routes from each router to other routers,
    every router advertises the directly connected subnet(s) to other
    routers.

    Then, each router adds the learned subnet to the IP routing table.

    Consider the following example:

    Three routers are connected and every router is connected directly
    to one subnet.
                                                          3: 10.1.3.0/24

   For router number 1, the following topology information are received:

     2: 21, 1000, 20 ==> Metric = 200,000    (Added)
     2: 32, 4000, 30 ==> Metric = 150,000    (Added)
     3: 31, 500, 50  ==> Metric = 1,000,000  (Discarded)
     3: 22, 3500, 60 ==> Metric = 342,857.1  (Discarded)

   Once every router learns the best route to every other router, each
   router learns the advertised subnets.

   The subnet information is advertised as follows (the exact over-the-
   wire format is specified in Appendix A.1 and A.3):

     a: subnet-number/mask  (for IPv4 [RFC791])
     a: prefix/length       (for IPv6 [RFC8200])

   Where "a" represents the advertised router RID that has the directly
   connected subnet or prefix.
 
   Then, each router builds its own IP routing table:

   For router number 1, the IP routing table will be as follows:

   ***************************************************************** 
   * Dest. Router * Destination Subnet *  Metric * Next-hop Router *
   *****************************************************************
   *      2       *    10.1.2.0/24     * 200,000 *        2        *    
   *****************************************************************
   *      3       *    10.1.3.0/24     * 150,000 *        2        *
   *****************************************************************

   If more than one subnet is directly connected to a router, another
   entry will be added to the IP routing table for that subnet with the
   same destination router, metric and next-hop router.

   For loop prevention, each received subnet information through a
   specific interface is not advertised again through this interface,
   but out of other interfaces.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a single value from the Protocol
   Numbers registry, to replace TBD1 in Appendix A.1.

6. Security Considerations

A. NEP Advertisement Format

   NEP routers advertise topology and subnet information.  This appendix
   describes exactly how they are advertised.

Appendix A.1. NEP Header

   NEP operates directly on top of IP, with protocol number TBD1.

Internet-Draft    Numbering Exchange Protocol (NEP)         January 2018

   Advertisements are communicated using the NEP header followed by the
   specific advertisement structure.

   The structure of the NEP header is as follows:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Version # = 1 |      Type     |            Length             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Checksum            |           Reserved            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The version of NEP described in this document is number 1.

   The Length field contains the length of the NEP data (not including
   the header).

   The Checksum field is the one's complement of the one's complement
   sum of all 16-bit words of the NEP header and of the NEP data,
   excluding the checksum itself (or setting it to 0).  If NEP is being
   used directly over a protocol providing other means of addressing
   (link/network and internetwork protocols), a pseudo-header is
   prepended to the NEP data.

   The Reserved field is reserved for future extensibility and MUST be
   set to 0 by implementations not using it.  [[Question: Should
   receivers not using the field ignore or discard packets with values
   of the Reserved field different from 0?]]

   The pseudo-header is the concatentation of the over-the-wire
   representations, in the following order, of:

   o  the source and destination addresses (including the lengths, if
      the upper protocol supports addresses of variable lengths), and

   o  the protocol number for NEP in the upper protocol, padded to
      32 bits, encoded as a big-endian number (in the sample captures,
      143 for IP).

   This algorithm is the same as used in TCP and UDP over
   IPv6 [RFC8200], except that it omits the length in the pseudo-header,
   as NEP already includes it in the NEP header.

A.2. Topology Advertisement

   In Sections 2, 3 and 4, topology advertisements of the form
   "a: rh, b, d" appear.  These advertisements have Type 0.
   Their structure is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

A.3. Subnet Advertisements

   In Section 4, subnet advertisements are described.  Below is their
   structure.

A.3.1. Mask-Based Subnet Advertisement

   NEP mask-based subnet advertisements, used for IPv4 [RFC791] have the
   following structure and Type 1:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Advertising Router RID                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                         Subnet prefix                         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                          Subnet mask                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This structure is generic and can be adapted to NEP over any other
   link/network or internetwork protocol, provided that the number of
   octets excluding the NEP header and the advertising router RID is
   even: the first half of these octets are the subnet prefix and the
   second half are the subnet mask.

A.3.2. Prefix-Based Subnet Advertisement

   NEP IPv6 [RFC8200] subnet advertisements have the following structure
   and Type 2:

   |                                                               |
   +                                                               +
   |                                                               |
   +                         Subnet prefix                         +
   |                                                               |
   +                                                               +
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The structure is generic and can be adapted to NEP over any other
   link/network or internetwork protocol: the subnet prefix is as many
   octets as an address of the link/network or internetwork protocol,
   and the prefix length is the number of bits in the prefix.
