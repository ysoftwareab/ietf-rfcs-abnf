1.  Introduction

   The Homenet working group has defined a mechanism for sharing
   information between homenet routers, in Home Networking Control
   Protocol [2].  This document recomments the use of the ".home" top-
   level name as a locally-resolved domain name.

   RFC7788 did not follow the process defined in Special Use Domain
   Names [1].  It is likely that, had this process been followed, it
   would not have been possible to gain consensus on the use of '.home'
   as the locally-resolved special-use top-level name for homenets,
   because this name is known to be informally in use by sites on the
   internet, and the use to which this name has been put is not well
   documented; it is impossible to say that there are no conflicting
   uses for the name, and so getting consensus to use it anyway would
   have been controversial, time consuming, and possibly futile.

   The RFC6761 process is not well-understood within the IETF, and the
   authors of RFC7788 were not aware of it.  Normally, authors are not
   expected to know all there is to know about IETF process, and IETF
   leadership, specifically working group chairs, area directors and
   directorate members are expected to engage in a review process that
   notices oversights of this sort.

   Unfortunately, in the case of RFC7788, none of the people who should
   have caught the missing RFC6761 reference did catch it, and RFC 7788
   was published as a consensus document that uses '.home' without ever
   reserving it in the RFC6761 Special-Use Domain Names registry.

   This document updates RFC 7788 to remove the specification to use
   '.home' for site-local name resolution within the homenet.

2.  Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol

   The final paragraph of RFC 7788, section 8, is updated as follows:

   OLD:

      Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide
      naming and service discovery with local significance.  A network-
      wide zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in

      order to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however, an
      administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV
      (Section 10.6) for the network to use a different one.  In case
      multiple are announced, the domain of the node with the greatest
      node identifier takes precedence.
