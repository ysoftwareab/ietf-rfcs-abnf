Signature = r || s || PVT   where r and s are octet strings of length
N = Ceiling(lg(p)/8) representing
N = Ceiling(n/8)   The number of octets used to represent fields r
                         and s in a Signature.  Also the number of
                         octets output by the hash function (see below).

HE = hash( HS || r || M );

s = s' (note that since p is less than 2^n, by Hasse's theorem
Jx = r  modulo p
