1.  Introduction

   This document defines the 'payto' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   [RFC3986] scheme for designating targets for payments.  In its
   simplest form, a 'payto' URL identifies a payment target type and
   optionally a target identifier.  Additional parameters, such as an
   amount or a payment reference, can be provided.

   The interpretation of the target identifier is defined by the payment
   target type, and typically represents either a bank account or an
   (unsettled) transaction.

2.  Syntax of a 'payto' URL

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) of
   [RFC5234].

     payto-URI = "payto" "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" opts ]
     opts = opt *( "&amp;" opt )
     opt = (generic-opt / authority-specific-opt) "=" *( pchar )
     generic-opt = "amount" / "creditor-name" / "debitor-name" /
                   "message" / "instruction"
     authority = <authority, see [RFC3986], Section 3.2>
     path-abempty = <path-abempty, see [RFC3986], Section 3.3>
     pchar = <pchar, see [RFC3986], Appendix A.>

3.  Semantics

   The authority component of a payment URI identifies the payment
   target type.  The payment target types are defined in the Payto
   Payment Target Type Registry, see Section 9.  The path component of
   the URI identifies the target for a payment as interpreted by the
   respective payment target type.  The query component of the URI can
   provide additional parameters for a payment.  Every payment method
   SHOULD accept the options defined in generic-opt.  The default
   operation of applications that invoke a URI with the payto scheme
   SHOULD be to launch an application (if available) associated with the
   payment target type that can initiate a payment.  If multiple
   handlers are registered for the same payment target type, the user
   SHOULD be able to choose which application to launch.  This allows
   users with multiple bank accounts (each accessed the respective
   bank's banking application) to choose which account to pay with.
   Details of the payment MUST be taken from the path and options given
   in the URI.  The user SHOULD be allowed to modify these details
   before confirming a payment.

4.  Examples

     payto://sepa/CH9300762011623852957?amount=EUR:200.0&message=hello

     INVALID (authority missing):  payto:sepa/12345


5.  Generic Options

   Applications MUST accept URIs with options in any order.  The
   "amount" option MUST only occur at most once.  Other options MAY be
   allowed multiple times, with further restrictions depending on the
   payment method.  The following options SHOULD be understood by every
   payment method.

   amount: The amount to transfer, including currency information if
   applicable.  The format MUST be:

     amount = [ currency ":" ] unit [ "." fraction ]
     currency = 1*ALPHA
     unit = 1*(DIGIT / ",")
     fraction = 1*(DIGIT / ",")


   The fraction MUST be smaller than 10^8.  The unit value MUST be
   smaller than 2^53.  The use of commas is optional for readability and
   they MUST be ignored.

Internet-Draft           The 'payto' URI scheme             October 2018


   creditor-name: Name of the entity that is credited (receives the
   payment).

   debitor-name: Name of the entity that is debited (makes the payment).

   message: A short message to identify the purpose of the payment,
   which MAY be subject to lossy conversions (for example, due to
   character set encoding limitations).

   instruction: A short message giving instructions to the recipient,
   which MUST NOT be subject to lossy conversions.  Character set
   limitations allowed for such instructions depend on the payment
   method.

6.  Encoding

   Various payment systems use restricted character sets.  An
   application that processes 'payto' URIs MUST convert characters that
   are not allowed by the respective payment systems into allowable
   character using either an encoding or a replacement table.  This
   conversion process MAY be lossy, except for the instruction field.

7.  Security Considerations

   Applications handling the payto URI scheme MUST NOT initiate any
   financial transactions without prior review and confirmation from the
   user, and MUST take measures to prevent clickjacking [HMW12].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  URI Scheme Registration

   The "payto" URI scheme is to be registered in the "Permanent URI
   Schemes" registry.

      Scheme name: payto

      Status: permanent

      URI scheme syntax: See Section 2.

      URI scheme semantics: See Section 3.

      Applications/protocols that use this scheme name: payto URIs are
      mainly used by financial software

9.  Payto Payment Method Registry

   This document defines a registry for payment methods.  The name of
   the registry is "Payto Payment Target Type Registry".

   The registry shall record for each entry:

   o  Name: The name of the payment target type (case insensitive ASCII
      string)

   o  Description: A description of the payment target type, including
      the semantics of the path in the URI if applicable.

   o  Contact: The contact information of a person to contact for
      further information

   o  References: Optionally, references describing the payment method
      (such as an RFC) and method-specific options

   The registration policy for this registry is "First Come First
   Served", as described in [RFC5226].

   The registry is initially populated with the following entries:

   +---------+-------------------------------+----------+--------------+
   | Name    | Description                   | Contact> | References   |
