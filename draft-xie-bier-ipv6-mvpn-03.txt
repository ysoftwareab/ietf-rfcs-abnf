1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] is an architecture
   that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring
   intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a
   multicast-specific BIER header.  BIERv6 refers to the deployment of
   BIER in IPv6 networks using the BIER IPv6 encapsulation format
   defined in [I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation].

   This document describes a method to realize MVPN services using BIER
   as a P-tunnel in the IPv6 Networks (BIERv6 Networks).  It defines a
   method to use an IPv6 address, called Src.DTx in this document, as

Internet-Draft                 BIERv6 MVPN                  October 2020


   source address of an IPv6 header, to identify the MVPN instance at
   the Egress PE.  The Src.DTx address used as source address of a
   BIERv6 packet represent both the context and the upstream-assigned
   VPN Label in MVPN scenario defined in [RFC8556].

   The Src.DTx address can be a normal IPv6 address of the BFR, for
   example, a loopback address of the BFR.  The Src.DTx address can also
   be an IPv6 address allocated from an IPv6 address block, for example,
   an IPv6 address allocated from an SRv6 locator if BIERv6 MVPN is
   deployed in an SRv6 network.

   In particular, MVPN deployment in IPv6 networks relies on L3VPN
   deployment on IPv6 networks firstly, thus the c-multicast routing
   procedure like Upstream Multicast Hop (UMH) Selection can be done.
   As an example, the L3VPN deployment in SRv6 networks can be referred
   to [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services].

   Global Table Multicast (GTM) defined in [RFC7716] is also covered in
   this document, as GTM shares the same BGP-MVPN signalling, while
   providing an approach of Non-VPN multicast over a service provider
   core with various P-tunnel type.  For the same reason of UMH
   selection as a base of GTM, the Global IPv4/IPv6 over SRv6 networks
   can be referred to [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services].

   o  SRv6 L3 Service - L3VPN/Global-L3 service in SRv6 networks defined
      in [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services], or MVPN/GTM service in BIERv6
      networks defined in this document.

3.  Use of PTA and Prefix-SID Attribute in x-PMSI A-D Routes

   The BGP-MVPN I-PMSI A-D (Type 1) or S-PMSI A-D (Type 3) route (called
   x-PMSI A-D route in this document), advertised by Ingress PE carries
   the BIER (Type 11) PTA as specified in [RFC8556].  The BIER PTA
   carried in the x-PMSI A-D route is used for explicitly tracking the
   receiver-site PEs which are interested in a specific multicast flow.
   It includes three BIER-specific fields, Sub-domain-id, BFR-id, and
   BFR-prefix.  For BIER P-tunnel using the BIERv6 encapsulation in IPv6
   networks, the BFR-prefix field in the PTA MUST be set to the BFIR
   IPv6 prefix and the MPLS Label field in the PTA MUST set to 0.  For
   MVPN over BIERv6, the Src.DTx IPv6 address of the BFIR is used to
   identify the VRF instead of an MPLS Label.  The Src.DTx IPv6 Address
   (Src.DT6 or Src.DT4 or Src.DT46) MUST be carried within an SRv6 L3
   Service TLV [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services] of BGP Prefix-SID attribute
   in the x-PMSI A-D route.

   The Ingress PE encapsulates the c-multicast IP packet with BIERv6
   header and the source address in the outer IPv6 header will be set to
   the Src.DTx IPv6 address advertised in the BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D
   routes.  See section 3 of [I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation] for the
   detailed packet format.

   Egress PE (BFER) receiving the x-PMSI A-D routes with BIER PTA and
   SRv6 L3 Service TLV learns the Src.DTx IPv6 address and uses it to
   identify the VRF of the c-multicast packet.

   When Egress PE receives a BIERv6 packet and the self bfr-id is set in
   the bit-string field of the BIERv6 header, it retrieves the Src.DTx
   IPv6 address from the source address of the IPv6 header to determine
   the VRF and the Address Family (AF) of the c-multicast data packet,
   and performs the MFIB lookup in the corresponding table.

4.  MVPN over BIERv6 Core

   [RFC8556] specifies the protocol and procedures to be followed by the
   Ingress and Egress PEs to use BIER as a P-tunnel for MVPN in MPLS
   networks.  This section specifies the required changes and procedures
   in addition to support BIER as a P-tunnel in IPv6 networks using
   BIERv6.

   In a IPv6 service provider network, many of the IP address fields
   used in the BGP-MVPN routes are IPv6 address as specified in
   [RFC6515].  These are listed below.

Internet-Draft                 BIERv6 MVPN                  October 2020


   o  "Originating Router's IP Address" in the NLRI of Type 1, 3 or 4
      BGP-MVPN route is an IPv6 address.

   o  "Network Address of Next Hop" field in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
      is an IPv6 address.

   o  Route Targets Extended Community (EC) used in C-multicast join
      (Type 6 or 7) route or Leaf A-D (Type 4) route is an IPv6 Address
      Specific Extended Community, where the Global Administrator field
      will be an IPv6 address identifies the Upstream PE or the UMH.

   o  "VRF Route Import Extended Community (EC)" carried by VPNv4 or
      VPNv6 unicast routes (SAFI 128) or multicast routes (SAFI 129) is
      an IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community.

   On the Ingress PE (BFIR), the BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D route is
   constructed as per the procedures specified in [RFC8556] and with the
   following specifications.

   o  MPLS Label field in the BIER PTA MUST be set to Zero.

   o  BFR-prefix field in the BIER PTA MUST be set to the Ingress PEs
      (BFIR) IPv6 BFR-Prefix Address.  It does not need to be the same
      as the other IPv6 address of the x-PMSI AD route.

   o  Route MUST also carry an BGP Prefix SID attribute with an SRv6 L3
      Service TLV carrying an Src.DTx IPv6 address uniquely identifying
      the MVPN instance.

   If the MVPN is IPv4 MVPN, the Src.DTx can be either Src.DT4 or
   Src.DT46.  If the MVPN is IPv6 MVPN, the Src.DTx can be either
   Src.DT6 or Src.DT46.  The distribution of the x-PMSI A-D routes uses
   the Src.DTx according to the local configuration, and is independent
   to the use of End.DTx in VPN-IP unicast routes of this VPN.  For
   example, one can use End.DT46 for VPNv4 and VPNv6 unicast routes, but
   use Src.DT4 for the MVPN routes for the same VPN.  Another example,
   one can use End.DX for VPNv4 unicast routes, but use Src.DT46 for the
   MVPN routes for the same VPN.

   BFIR MAY carry the BGP Prefix-SID attribute only in I-PMSI A-D route
   when I-PMSI A-D route is used, while other S-PMSI A-D routes do not
   carry the BGP Prefix-SID attribute.

   BFIR MAY carry the BGP Prefix-SID attribute only in wildcard S-PMSI
   A-D routes when the "S-PMSI Only" mode as described in [RFC6625] is
   used, while other S-PMSI A-D routes do not carry the BGP Prefix-SID
   attribute.

Internet-Draft                 BIERv6 MVPN                  October 2020


   On the Egress PE (BFER), the BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D route is processed
   as per the procedures specified in [RFC8556] and with the following
   specifications:

   o  The MPLS Label field in the BIER PTA of the BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D
      route MUST be ignored and MUST not be used for the identification
      of the VRF.

   o  The BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D route MUST be dropped if the BFR-prefix
      field in the BIER PTA is not an IPv6 address.

   o  The BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D route MUST be dropped if it does not carry
      a Src.DTx IPv6 address in the SRv6 L3 Service TLV in BGP Prefix
      SID attribute.

   o  Leaf A-D route originated by the Egress PE (BFER) MUST carry the
      BIER PTA with the BFR-prefix field set to the BFER IPv6 BFR-
      prefix.

   Valid BGP-MVPN x-PMSI A-D route received by an Egress PE (BFER) is
   stored locally, and the Src.DTx IPv6 Address carried in the SRv6 L3
   service TLV is used to identify the VRF of a c-multicast data packet.
   This may be populated into forwarding table only when there is
   c-multicast flow state with UMH of the specific BFIR this Src.DTx
   located in.

   If more than one x-PMSI A-D routes belonging to the same VRF has
   different Src.DTx value, the processing is determined by the local
   policy of the BFER.

   If more than one x-PMSI A-D routes belonging to different VRF has the
   same Src.DTx value, the BFER must log an error, and a BIERv6 packet
   with this Src.DTx as the IPv6 source address MUST be dropped.

   The BGP Prefix-SID attribute (which may include the Src.DTx in SRv6
   L3 Service TLV) MUST NOT be carried in Leaf A-D route upon sending,
   and MUST be ignored upon reception.

5.  GTM over BIERv6 Core

   As specified in [RFC7716], Global Table Multicast (GTM) uses the same
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) value, the same Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) format, and the same procedures
   of MVPN with only a few adaptions.  It support for both IPv4 and IPv6
   multicast flows over either an IPv4 or IPv6 SP infrastructure.  GTM
   over BIERv6 core is obviously a case of IPv4/IPv6 multicast over an
   IPv6 SP infrastructure with BIERv6 data-plane.

Internet-Draft                 BIERv6 MVPN                  October 2020


   The BIER (Type 11) PTA attribute and the BGP Prefix-SID attribute are
   carried in the x-PMSI A-D route in GTM cases.  When the a BGP-MVPN
   x-PMSI A-D route is received by Egress PE, it is stored locally, and
   the Src.DTx IPv6 Address of the Ingress PE in the route is used to
   determine the VRF of a packet, which is the 'public' VRF in the case
   of GTM.

   There are some other attributes listed below for GTM over a BIERv6
   core:

   o  Route Distinguishers - the RD field of a BGP-MVPN route's NLRI
      MUST be set to zero (i.e., to 64 bits of zero) to represent a Non-
      VPN GTM.  See section 2.2 of [RFC7716].

   o  Route Targets Extended Community (EC) - The RT EC carried by the
      BGP-MVPN C-multicast (Type 6 or 7) route or Leaf A-D (Type 4)
      route MUST be an IPv6-address-specific Extended Community (EC).
      The Global Administrator field identifies the Upstream PE or the
      UMH, and the Local Administrator field MUST always be set to zero
      in GTM case.

   o  VRF Route Import Extended Community (EC) - The VRF Route Import EC
      carried by IPv4 or IPv6 routes (SAFI 1 or 4) or multicast routes
      (SAFI 2) is an IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community.

   GTM IPv4 multicast over an BIERv6 core may be considered an
   alternative to support IPv4 IPTV content delivery during transition
   to IPv6 period comparing to [RFC8114].  They both use IPv4-in-IPv6
   encapsulation, while BIERv6 uses an additional BIER header within an
   IPv6 Extension header to support stateless core.

6.1.  Encapsulation of Multicast Traffic

   BIER IPv6 encapsulation (BIERv6) [I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation] is
   used for forwarding the c-multicast traffic through an IPv6 core.
   The following diagram shows the progression of an MVPN c-multicast
   packet as it enters and leaves the intra-AS service-provider network.

                    Figure 1: BIERv6 MVPN/GTM Intra-AS

   The Src.DTx SHOULD support as destination address of an ICMPv6
   packet.  If a loopback address of the BFR is used as Src.DTx address,
   this is supported.  If an address from an SRv6 locator is used as
   Src.DTx address, the following pseudo-code describes how a packet
   with Src.DTx as destination address is handled:

       1. IF Last_NH = ICMPv6   ;;Ref1
       2.   Send to CPU.
       3. ELSE
       4.   Drop the packet.

   Ref1: ICMPv6 packet using Src.DT4, Src.DT6 or Src.DT46 as destination
   address.

6.2.  MTU

   Each BFIR is expected to know the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of
   the BIER domain and the size of the BIERv6 encapsulation, thus each
   BFIR can deduce the maximum size of the payload that can be
   encapsulated in a BIERv6 packet.  The section 3 of [RFC8296] applies.

6.3.  TTL

   The ingress PE (BFIR) should not copy the Time to Live (TTL) field
   from the payload IP header received from a CE router to the delivery
   IP header.  Setting the TTL of the delivery IP header is determined
   by the local policy of the ingress PE (BFIR) router per section 3 of
   [RFC8296].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations defined in [RFC8556] and
   [I-D.xie-bier-ipv6-encapsulation] apply equally to this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Allocation is expected from IANA for the following Src.DTx functions
   codepoints from the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors" sub-registry.

   Values 68, 69, 70 is suggested for Src.DT6, Src.DT4, Src.DT46
   respectively.
