Abstract

   This document describes the mechanism to achieve multi-domain service
   forwarding for NSH. The purposed mechanism adopts a horizontal
   deployment structure, which divides a multi-domain SFC into several
   segmental SFCs in the control plane and each domain creates its own
   SFP independently in data plane. A label is purposed to identify
   different cross-domain flows at the classifier by extending the
   metadata of the NSH encapsulation.

1. Introduction

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665] is an architecture purposed
   to decouple traditional network service functions with corresponding
   physical resources. It is flexible and convenience for a network
   operator to deploy on-demand service functions and steer the traffic
   through them in sequence.

   Network Service Header (NSH) [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] is defined as a data
   plane protocol to create a dynamic service function chaining.
   According to the NSH encapsulation, the flow can pass along its
   service function path and exchange metadata among the Service

   Classifier, the Service Function and the Service Function Forwarder
   for information sharing.

   Network service forwarding in SFC is based on the combination of
   Service Path Identifier (SPI) and Service index (SI), which is
   described in [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh]. [I-D.kumar-sfc-nsh-forwarding]
   analyzes the NSH forwarding shortcomings and further discusses the
   separation of the service forwarding and the service delivery.
   However, it focuses on infrastructure service forwarding for NSH in
   single domain. [I-D.dolson-sfc-hierarchical] purpose a hierarchical
   way to achieves multi-domain SFC, which can be regarded as a vertical
   approach. Contrast to the vertical approach, a horizontal one is easy
   to scale in and out. Besides, the horizontal approach can decrease
   the overhead of the control plane, because it maintains more service
   traffic in the data plane.

   Therefore, this document purposes a horizontal approach to achieve
   multi-domain service forwarding for NSH. The main idea is to divide a
   multi-domain SFC into several segmental SFCs according to domain
   partitions in the control plane and create corresponding SFP in each
   domain by its classifier independently. A label is purposed to
   identify different cross-domain flows, which is encapsulated in the
   metadata.

1.1. Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Definition Of Terms

   This document uses some terms defined in SFC architecture [RFC7665]
   and NSH [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] drafts for ease of understanding and the
   reader is advised to refer to those documents for up to date and
   additional information.

   Segmental SFC: The cross-domain SFC is divided into several segmental
   SFCs according to the domain partitions. Each segmental SFC is
   assigned to its corresponding domain.

   Service Label: A label used to identify different flows can help the
   classifier create the SFP by its corresponding segmental SFC, which
   is issued from SFC control plane.

   Cross-domain Forwarding Table: There are three columns in the table:
   Service Label, Next Classifier and Segmental SFC. The table matches a

   specific flow with its Service Label. The cross-domain forwarding of
   a flow is depended on the address of Next Classifier. The Cross-
   domain Forwarding Table is maintained by SFC control plane and issued
   to corresponding classifier according to the Segmental SFC.

                     Figure 1 Multi-domain SFC Divide

   As shown in Figure 1, SFC control plane divides the whole SFC and
   issues cross-domain forwarding tables to corresponding classifiers
   initially. Multi-domain service forwarding includes two aspects: the
   inter-domain service forwarding and the intra-domain forwarding. The
   former is based on a unique label for each flow, and the latter is
   performed by the classifier. To achieve a unify service forwarding
   mechanism in multi-domain, this mechanism uses metadata in NSH
   encapsulation to carry the necessary forwarding information among
   different forwarding elements, such as the Service Classifier and the
   Service Function Forwarder.

3.1. Service Function Chaining Segmentation

   At first, the orchestrator in SFC control plane creates a SFC with a
   unique Service Label for the flow. Then, the SFC is divided into
   several segmental SFCs according to physical resource constraints. It
   is important to note that the control plane MUST NOT specific the SFP
   directly. The control plane is only responsible to indicate what
   service functions are required in each domain, and the corresponding
   SFP MUST be specified by the service classifier.

3.2. Inter-domain Service Forwarding

   The Service Label is purposed to identify different flows when
   packets need to be cross-domain forwarded. When the service
   classifier receives a packet with the NSH encapsulation, it firstly
   checks the Service Label of the packet to look up the address of the
   next classifier in its cross-domain forwarding table. The table is
   issued by SFC control plane. Then the information of next classifier
   is written into the metadata and will be used by the last SFF in the
   domain. Once the last SFF receives the packet from last SF in the
   domain, which changes the SI to zero, it forwards the packet to next
   classifier directly without any modification of the NSH encapsulation.

3.3. Classification and Intra-domain Service Forwarding

   The service classifier creates SFP for each flow according to the
   segmental SFC in its cross-domain forwarding table. After the control
   plane assigns segmental SFCs for different domains, the corresponding
   table is issued to the classifier in each domain. When the packet
   with an NSH encapsulation arrives at the classifier, its Service
   Label is used to find out the corresponding segmental SFC. Then, the
   classifier creates a SFP for the flow according to its segmental SFC.

4. Multi-domain Service Forwarding Encapsulation

   In order to reduce overhead of metadata, the context header with MD
   Type = 0x2 is chosen to support multi-domain service forwarding,
   Figure 2 shows the allocation of the metadata.

   Context Header Allocation Descriptions:

   Metadata Class: It MUST be set to 0x20 as requested in Section 7.

   C bit: It SHOULD be set indicating critical metadata exists.

Internet-Draft           Multi-domain For NSH            June 10, 2016


   Type: It MUST be set to 0x1 for multi-domain service forwarding.

   Len: Because the length of the context header is constant, it MUST be
   set to 0x4.

   D bit: The default value is zero, which means the metadata SHOULD be
   ignored. When set to 0x1 indicates that this packet need to be
   forwarded in multiple domains.

   Service Label: Identifies different flows with different labels. The
   service classifier decides the service forwarding path of the packet
   according to its domain label with a forwarding table issued by
   control plane.

   Next Classifier: Indicates the address of the classifier in next
   domain. Because of the SFC segmentation, each classifier only works
   in the SFC domain it belongs to. When a packet leaves current domain,
   it will notice the last SFF where is the next classifier.

   All other flag fields are reserved for future use. Reserved bits MUST
   be set to zero and MUST be ignored upon receipt.

              Figure 3 Multi-domain Service Forwarding Example

   This section describes the scenario shown in Figure 3, a packet flow
   pass through tree service functions deployed in two domains. The
   domain1 is consist of CF1, SFF1-1, SFF1-2, SF-a and SF-b; the domain2 is
   consist of CF2, SFF2-1 and SF-c. The workflow is as follow:

   1.SFC control plane creates the SFC with a Service Label for the
   specific flow and divides the whole SFC into several segmental SFCs

   2.The cross-domain forwarding table is issued to its corresponding
   classifier with Service Label, Next Classifier and Segmental SFC

Internet-Draft           Multi-domain For NSH            June 10, 2016


   3.CF1(the classifier in domain1) creates the SFP and the NSH
   encapsulation for the flow packet according to its segmental SFC in
   domain1. It sets 'D' flag to 1 and fills in the Service Label and
   Next Classifier.

   4.CF1 forwards the packet to SFF1-1

   5.SFF1-1 determines SF-a as the next hop and forwards the packet.

   6.After SF-a processes the packet, the packet is forwarded back to
   SFF with decremented SI

   7.SFF1-1 forwards the received packet to SFF1-2

   8.SFF1-2 determines SF-a as the next hop and forwards the packet.

   9.Similar to SF-a, SF-b forwards the packet to SFF1-2 and decrements
   SI to zero

   10.When SFF1-2 receives the packet, it finds out that the SFP is
   terminate in this domain because of the SI, and then SFF1-2 forwards
   the packet to next classifier without modification of the NSH
   encapsulation

   11.CF2(the classifier in domain2) receives the packet with an NSH
   encapsulation, checks its Service Label.

   12.Accroding to the Service Label, CF2 looks up segmental SFC in the
   cross-domain forwarding table and creates the corresponding SFP and
   the NSH encapsulation

   13.CF2 sets the 'D' flag to zero and forwards the packet to SFF2-1

   13.SFF2-1 determines SF-c as the next hop and forwards the packet

   14.SFc processes the packet and forwards it back to SFF2-1 with
   decremented SI

   15.SFF2-1 finds out that the SFP is terminate and forwards the packet
   to the final Receiver

6. Security Considerations

   As with many other protocols, metadata of the NSH encapsulation can
   be spoofed or otherwise modified. It is important to protect the
   cross-domain packet from malicious modification, because the metadata
   contains sensitive information about the user and environment.

Internet-Draft           Multi-domain For NSH            June 10, 2016


   Therefore, it is significate to ensure the integrity of the metadata
   and provide the protection of the user privacy.

7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new class from the TLV Class defined
   in [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh].

   0x20 Multi-domain Forwarding Type

   IANA is requested to set up a registry of "NSH Multi-domain Service
   Forwarding TLV Types".  These are 7-bit values.  Registry entries
   are assigned by using the "IETF Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].

   IANA is requested to allocate two new types as follows:

   o Type = 0x00 Reserved

   o Type = 0x01 Multi-domain Service Forwarding

8. Conclusions

   This document purposes a mechanism for multi-domain service
   forwarding based on a unique label. In order to relieve the pressure
   of the control plane, the multi-domain SFC is divided into segmental
   SFC according to the domain partitions, and the SFP in each domain is
   created independently.
