                  Protecting EST payloads with OSCORE
                 draft-selander-ace-coap-est-oscore-02

Abstract

   This document specifies public key certificate enrollment procedures
   protected with application-layer security protocols suitable for
   Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.  The protocols leverage payload
   formats defined in Enrolment over Secure Transport (EST) and existing
   IoT standards including the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and the CBOR Object
   Signing and Encryption (COSE) format.

1.  Introduction

   One of the challenges with deploying a Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) for the Internet of Things (IoT) is certificate enrolment,
   because existing enrolment protocols are not optimized for
   constrained environments [RFC7228].

   One optimization of certificate enrollment targeting IoT deployments
   is specified in EST-CoAPs ([I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]), which defines a
   version of Enrolment over Secure Transport [RFC7030] for transporting
   EST payloads over CoAP [RFC7252] and DTLS [RFC6347], instead of
   secured HTTP.

   This document describes a method for protecting EST payloads over
   CoAP or HTTP with OSCORE [I-D.ietf-core-object-security].  OSCORE
   specifies an extension to CoAP which protects the application layer
   message and can be applied independently of how CoAP messages are
   transported.  OSCORE can also be applied to CoAP-mappable HTTP which
   enables end-to-end security for mixed CoAP and HTTP transfer of
   application layer data.  Hence EST payloads can be protected end-to-

Internet-Draft     Protecting EST payloads with OSCORE        March 2019


   end independent of underlying transport and through proxies
   translating between between CoAP and HTTP.

   OSCORE is designed for constrained environments, building on IoT
   standards such as CoAP, CBOR [RFC7049] and COSE [RFC8152], and has in
   particular gained traction in settings where message sizes and the
   number of exchanged messages needs to be kept at a minimum, see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security], or for securing multicast CoAP
   messages [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  Where OSCORE is
   implemented and used for communication security, the reuse of OSCORE
   for other purposes, such as enrolment, reduces the implementation
   footprint.

   In order to protect certificate enrolment with OSCORE, the necessary
   keying material (notably, the OSCORE Master Secret, see
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]) needs to be established between CoAP
   client and server, e.g. using a key exchange protocol; a trusted
   third party; or pre-established keys.  Different options are allowed
   and with different properties as is indicated in the next section.

   Yet other optimizations to certificate based enrolment are possible
   further improve the performance of certificate enrolment and
   certificate based authentication, in particular the use of more
   compact representations of X.509 certificates such as
   [I-D.raza-ace-cbor-certificates].

1.1.  EST-CoAPs operational differences

   This specification builds on EST-CoAPs [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] but
   transport layer security provided by DTLS is replaced, or
   complemented, by protection of the application layer data.  This
   specification deviates from EST-CoAPs in the following respects:

   o  The DTLS record layer is replaced, or complemented, with OSCORE.

   o  The DTLS handshake is replaced, or complemented, with an
      alternative key establishment, for example:

      *  A key exchange protocol, such as EDHOC
         [I-D.selander-ace-cose-ecdhe].  The use of a key exchange
         protocol completes the analogy with EST-CoAPs, and provides
         perfect forward secrecy (PFS) of the keys used to protect the
         EST messages.  However, PFS is not necessary for the enrolment
         procedure and adds significant overhead in terms of message
         size and round trips.

      *  Trusted third party (TTP) based provisioning, such as the
         OSCORE profile of ACE [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].  This



Selander, et al.        Expires September 9, 2019               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Protecting EST payloads with OSCORE        March 2019


         assumes existing security associations between the client and
         the TTP, and between the server and the TTP, and reduces the
         message size and round trips compared to a key exchange
         protocol.

      *  Pre-shared keys (PSK).  Although one reason for using a PKI is
         to avoid managing PSK, applying OSCORE directly with PSK
         specifically during deployment gives a one round-trip enrolment
         protocol with low message overhead, thereby further reducing
         the network load and time for commissioning.

   o  EST payloads protected by OSCORE can be proxied between
      constrained networks supporting CoAP/CoAPs and non-constrained
      networks supporting HTTP/HTTPs with a CoAP-HTTP proxy protection
      without any security processing in the proxy.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   words may also appear in this document in lowercase, absent their
   normative meanings.

   This document uses terminology from [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] which in
   turn is based on [RFC7030] and, in turn, on [RFC5272].

2.  Protocol Design and Layering

   EST-oscore uses CoAP [RFC7252] and Block-Wise [RFC7959] to transfer
   EST messages in the same way as [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].  Figure 1
   below shows the layered EST-oscore architecture.

            +------------------------------------------------+
            |          EST request/response messages         |
            +------------------------------------------------+
            |   CoAP with OSCORE   |   HTTP with OSCORE      |
            +------------------------------------------------+
            |   UDP  |  DTLS/UDP   |        TLS/TCP          |
            +------------------------------------------------+


                   Figure 1: EST protected with OSCORE.

   EST-oscore follows closely the EST-coaps and EST design.  The message
   types for simple enroll, reenroll, CA certificate retrieval, CSR
   Attributes request messages and server-side key generation messages
   apply.  Section references in this paragraph refer to EST-coaps



Selander, et al.        Expires September 9, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Protecting EST payloads with OSCORE        March 2019


   ([I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]): The payload format, message bindings, CoAP
   response codes, message fragmentation based on Blockwise, and the
   delayed responses specified in Section 5 apply.

3.  Discovery and URI

   The discovery of EST resources defined in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est], as well as the new Resource Type defined in
   Section 9.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] apply to EST-oscore.  Support
   for OSCORE is indicated by the "osc" attribute defined in Section 9
   of [I-D.ietf-core-object-security], for example:

        REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=ace.est.sen

        RES: 2.05 Content
      </est>; rt="ace.est";osc


   The short EST-coaps URI paths defined in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] also apply.

4.  OSCORE-Based Security

   EST-oscore depends on the application layer security provided by
   OSCORE for protecting CoAP and CoAP-mappable HTTP independent of
   transport.  The establishment of keys for OSCORE defines many of the
   properties of the protocol.

   If a key exchange protocols is used, fragmentation of the protocol
   messages needs to be handled.  EDHOC [I-D.selander-ace-cose-ecdhe]
   may be carried in CoAP in which case Block fragmentation can be used.

5.  Proxying

   As is noted Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est], in real-world
   deployments, the EST server will not always reside within the CoAP
   boundary.  The EST-server can exist outside the constrained network
   in a non-constrained network that does not support CoAP but HTTP,
   thus requiring an intermediary CoAP-to-HTTP proxy.

   Since OSCORE is applicable to CoAP-mappable HTTP the EST payloads can
   be protected end-to-end between EST client and EST server independent
   of transport protocol or potential transport layer security which may
   need to be terminated in the proxy, see Figure Figure 2.  The signed
   certification request SHOULD be bound to the OSCORE security context
   using a derived secret analogously to the use of tls-unique as
   described in Section 3.5 of [RFC7030].  The mappings between CoAP and
   HTTP referred to in Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] applies and

Internet-Draft     Protecting EST payloads with OSCORE        March 2019


   the additional mappings resulting from the use of OSCORE are
   specified in Section 11 of [I-D.ietf-core-object-security].

   OSCORE provides security end-to-end between EST Server and EST
   Client.  The use of TLS and DTLS is optional.
