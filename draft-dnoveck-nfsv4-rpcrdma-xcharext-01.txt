1.  Preliminaries

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to RPC-over-RDMA Version Two.
   It allows each participating endpoint on a single connection to
   communicate various characteristics of its implementation, to request
   changes in characteristics of the other endpoint, and to effect

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   changes and notify the other endpoint of changes to these
   characteristics during operation.

   The extension described herein specifies OPTIONAL message header
   types to implement this mechanism.  The means by which the
   implementation support status of these OPTIONAL types is ascertained
   is described in [rpcrmdav2].

   Although this document specifies the new OPTIONAL message header
   types to implement these functions, the precise means by which the
   presence of support for these OPTIONAL functions will be ascertained
   is not described here, as would be done more appropriately by the RFC
   defining a version of RPC-over-RDMA which supports protocol
   extension.

   This document is currently written to conform to the extension model
   for RPC-over-RDMA Version Two as described in [rpcrdmav2].

1.3.  Role Terminology

   A number of different terms are used regarding the roles of the two
   participants in an RPC-over-RMA connection.  Some of these roles last
   for the duration of a connection while others vary from request to
   request or from message to message.

   The roles of the client and server are fixed for the lifetime of the
   connection, with the client defined as the endpoint which initiated
   the connection.

   The roles of requester and responder often parallel those of client
   and server, although this is not always the case.  Most requests are
   made in the forward direction, in which the client is the requester
   and the server is the responder.  However, backward-direction
   requests are possible, in which case the server is the requester and
   the client is the responder.  As a result, clients and servers may
   both act as requesters and responders.

   The roles of sender and receiver vary from message.  With regard to
   the messages described in this document, both the client and the
   server can act as sender and receiver.  With regard to messages used
   to transfer RPC requests and replies, the requester sends requests
   and receives replies while the responder receives requests and sends
   replies.

2.  Transport Characteristics

2.1.  Characteristics Model

   An initial set of receiver and sender characteristics are specified
   in this document.  An extensible approach is used, allowing new
   characteristics to be defined in future standards track documents.

   Such characteristics are specified using:

   o  A code identifying the particular transport characteristic being
      specified.

   o  A nominally opaque array which contains within it the XDR encoding
      of the specific characteristic indicated by the associated code.

   The following XDR types are used by operations that deal with
   transport characteristics:

   <CODE BEGINS>

   typedef xcharid         uint32;

   struct xcharval {
           xcharid         xchv_which;
           opaque          xchv_data<>;
   };

   typedef xcharspec       xcharval<>;

   typedef uint32          xcharsubset<>;

   <CODE ENDS>

   An xcharid specifies a particular transport characteristic.  In order
   to allow easier XDR extension of the set of characteristics by
   concatenating XDR files, specific characteristics are defined as
   const values rather than as elements in an enum.

   An xcharval specifies a value of a particular transport
   characteristic with the particular characteristic identified by
   xchv_which, while the associated value of that characteristic is
   contained within xchv_data.

   While xchv_data is defined as opaque within the XDR, the contents are
   interpreted using the XDR typedef associated with the characteristic
   specified by xchv_which.  The receiver of a message containing an

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   xcharval MUST report an XDR error if the length of xchv_data is such
   that it extends beyond the bounds of the message transferred.

   In cases in which the xcharid specified by xchv_which is understood
   by the receiver, the receiver also MUST report an XDR error if either
   of the following occur:

   o  The nominally opaque data within xchv_data is not valid when
      interpreted using the characteristic-associated typedef.

   o  The length of xchv_data is insufficient to contain the data
      represented by the characteristic-associated typedef.

   Note that no error is to be reported if xchv_which is unknown to the
   receiver.  In that case, that xcharval is not processed and
   processing continues using the next xcharval, if any.

   An xcharspec specifies a set of transport characteristics.  No
   particular ordering of the xcharvals within it is imposed.

   An xcharsubset identifies a subset of the characteristics in a
   previously specified xcharspec.  Each bit in the mask denotes a
   particular element in a previously specified xcharspec.  If a
   particular xcharval is at position N in the array, then bit number N
   mod 32 in word N div 32 specifies whether that particular xcharval is
   included in the defined subset.  Words beyond the last one specified
   are treated as containing zero.

   xcharsubsets are useful in a number of contexts:

   o  In an initial specification of transport characteristics, they
      allow the sender to specify what subset of those are subject to
      later change.

   o  In responding to a request to modify a set of transport
      characteristics, allows the responding endpoint to specify the
      subset of those characteristics that have been performed, have
      been requested, or have been accepted for later change, with
      notification of that change to be done asynchronously.

2.2.  Transport Characteristics Groups

   Transport characteristics are divided into a number of groups

   o  An initial set of transport characteristics defined in this
      document.  See Section 3 for the complete list.





Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   o  Additional transport characteristics defined in future standards
      track documents as specified in Section 6.1.

   o  Experimental transport characteristics being explored preparatory
      to being considered for standards track definition.  See the
      description in Section 6.2.

2.3.  Operations Related to Transport Characteristics

   There are a number of operations defined in Section 4 which are used
   to communicate and manage transport characteristics.

   Prime among these is INIT_XCHAR (defined in Section 4.1 which serves
   as a means by which an endpoints transport characteristics may be
   presented to its peer, typically upon establishing a connection.

   In addition, there are a set of related operations concerned with
   requesting, effecting and reporting changes in transport
   characteristics:

   o  REQ_XCHAR (defined in Section 4.2 which serves as a way for an
      endpoint to request that a peer change the value of a set of
      transport characteristics.

   o  RESP_XCHAR (defined in Section 4.3 is used to report on the
      disposition of each of the individual transport characteristic
      changes requested in a previous REQ_XCHAR>

   o  UPD_XCHAR (defined in Section 4.4 is used to report a change in a
      transport characteristic.  This may be one requested by a previous
      REQ_XCHAR, or one decided on without being requested by a peer.

   Unlike many other operation types, the above are not used to effect
   transfer of RPC request but are internal one-way information
   transfers.  However, a REQ_CHAR and the corresponding RESP_XCHAR do
   constitute an RPC-like remote call.  The other operations are not
   part of a remote call transaction, although one or more asynchronous
   UPD_XCHAR operations may result from a REQ_XCHAR.

3.  Initial Transport Characteristics

   Although the set of transport characteristics is subject to later
   extension, an initial set of transport characteristics is defined
   below in Table 1.

   In that table, the columns contain the following information:





Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   o  The column labeled "characteristic" identifies the transport
      characteristic described by the current row.

   o  The column labeled "code" specifies the xcharid value used to
      identify this characteristic.

   o  The column labeled "XDR type" gives the XDR type of the data used
      to communicate the value of this characteristic.  This data type
      overlays the nominally opaque field xchv_data in an xcharval.

   o  The column labeled "default" gives the default value for the
      characteristic which is to be assumed by those who do not receive,
      or are unable to interpret, information about the actual value of
      the characteristic.

   o  The column labeled "section" indicates the section (within this
      document) that explains the semantics and use of this transport
      characteristic.

   +----------------------+------+-----------+---------------+---------+
   | characteristic       | code | XDR type  | default       | section |
   +----------------------+------+-----------+---------------+---------+
   | Receive Buffer Size  | 1    | uint32    | 4096          | 3.1     |
   | Requester Remote     | 2    | bool      | false         | 3.2     |
   | Invalidation         |      |           |               |         |
   | Backward Request     | 3    | enum      | BKRQSUP_SZLIM | 3.3     |
   | Support              |      | bkrqsup   |               |         |
   +----------------------+------+-----------+---------------+---------+

                                  Table 1

   Note that there is no explicit indication regarding whether a
   particular characteristic can change or whether a change in the value
   may be requested (see Section 4.2).  Such matters are not addressed
   by the protocol definition.  A partner implementation can always
   request a change but peers MAY reject a request to change a
   characteristic for any reason.  Implementations are always free to
   reject such requests if they cannot or do not wish to effect the
   requested change.

   Either of the following will result in effective rejection requests
   to change specific characteristics:

   o  If an endpoint does not wish to accept request to change
      particular characteristics, it may reject such requests as
      described in Section 4.3.





Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   o  If an endpoint does not support the REQ_XCHAR operation, the
      effect would be the same as if every request to change a set of
      characteristic were rejected.

   With regard to unrequested changes in transport characteristics, it
   is the responsibility of the implementation making the change to do
   so in a fashion that which does not interfere with the other
   partner's continued correct operation (see Section 3.1).

3.1.  Receive Buffer Size

   The Receive Buffer Size specifies the minimum size, in octets, of
   pre-posted receive buffers.  It is the responsibility of the
   participant sending this value to ensure that its pre-posted receives
   are at least the size specified, allowing the participant receiving
   this value to send messages that are of this size.

   <CODE BEGINS>

   const uint32    XCHAR_RBSIZ = 1;
   typedef uint32  xchrbsiz;

   <CODE ENDS>

   The sender may use his knowledge of the receiver's buffer size to
   determine when the message to be sent will fit in the preposted
   receive buffers that the receiver has set up.  In particular,

   o  Requesters may use the value to determine when it is necessary to
      provide a Position-Zero read chunk when sending a request.

   o  Requesters may use the value to determine when it is necessary to
      provide a Reply chunk when sending a request, based on the maximum
      possible size of the reply.

   o  Responders may use the value to determine when it is necessary,
      given the actual size of the reply, to actually use a Reply chunk
      provided by the requester.

   Because there may be pre-posted receives with buffer sizes that
   reflect earlier values of the buffer size characteristic, changing
   this characteristics poses special difficulties:

   o  When the size is being raised, the partner should not be informed
      of the change until all pending receives using the older value
      have been eliminated.





Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   o  The size should not be reduced until the partner is aware of the
      need to reduce the size of future sends to conform to this reduced
      value.  To ensure this, such a change should only occur in
      response to an explicit request by the other endpoint (See
      Section 4.2).  The participant making the request should use that
      lower size as the send size limit until the request is rejected
      (See Section 4.3) or an update to a size larger than the requested
      value becomes effective and the requested change is no longer
      pending (See Section 4.4).

3.2.  Requester Remote Invalidation

   The Requester Remote Invalidation characteristic indicates that the
   current endpoint, when in the role of a requester, is prepared for
   the responder to use RDMA Send With Invalidate when replying to an
   RPC-over-RDMA request containing non-empty chuck lists.

   As RPC-over-RDMA is currently used, memory registrations exposed to
   peers are not established by the server and explicit RDMA operations
   are not done to satisfy backward direction requests.  This makes it
   unlikely that servers will present non-default values of the
   XCHAR_RQREQ characteristic or that clients will take note of that
   value when presented by servers.

   <CODE BEGINS>

   const uint32    XCHAR_RQREMINV = 2;
   typedef bool    xchrrqrem;

   <CODE ENDS>

   When the Requester Remote Invalidate characteristic is set to false,
   a responder MUST use Send to convey RPC reply messages to the
   requester.  When the Requester Remote Invalidate characteristic is
   set to true, a responder MAY use Send With Invalidate instead of Send
   to convey RPC replies to the requester.

   The value of the Requester Remote Invalidate characteristic is not
   likely to change from the value reported by INIT_XCHAR (see
   Section 4.2).

3.3.  Backward Request Support

   The value of this characteristic is used to indicate an
   implementation's readiness to accept and process messages that are
   part of backward-direction RPC requests.  The server uses this
   characteristic to indicate support for backward-direction requests,




Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   while the client may use it to indicate readiness to process various
   forms of backward-direction replies.

   <CODE BEGINS>

   enum bkrqsup {
           BKRQSUP_UNKNOWN = 0,
           BKRQSUP_NONE    = 1,
           BKRQSUP_SZLIM   = 2,
           BKRQSUP_GENL    = 3
   };

   const uint32    XCHAR_BRS = 3;
   typedef bkrqsup xchrbrs;

   <CODE ENDS>

   Multiple levels of support are distinguished:

   o  The value BKRQSUP_UNKNOWN, typically in effect as a default,
      indicates that the support level is to be determined as specified
      below.

   o  The value BKRQSUP_NONE indicates that receipt of backward-
      direction requests and replies is not supported.

   o  The value BKRQSUP_SZLIM indicates that receipt of backward-
      direction requests or replies is only supported within the limited
      framework described in [bidir].

   o  The value BKRQSUP_GENL that receipt of backward-direction requests
      or replies is supported in the same ways that forward-direction
      requests or replies typically are.

   In the case of a server, values of BKRQSUP_UNKNOWN can be interpreted
   as indicating that support for backward-direction requests is not
   present.  However, in some cases, the ULP is such that support must
   be presumed.  For example, in the case in which a connection is
   established for use by NFSv4.1, support for size-limited callback
   support can be tested for by issuing a CB_NULL request.

   The support level of clients can be inferred from the backward-
   direction requests that they issue, assuming that issuing a request
   implicitly indicates support for receiving the corresponding reply.
   On this basis, support for receiving size-limited replies can be
   assumed when requests without read chunks, write chunks, or Reply
   chunks are issued, while requests with any of these elements allow

   the server to assume that general support for backward-direction
   replies is present on the client.

4.  New Operations

   The proposed new operation are set forth in Table 2 below.  In that
   table, the columns contain the following information:

   o  The column labeled "operation" specifies the particular operation.

   o  The column labeled "code" specifies the value of opttype for this
      operation.

   o  The column labeled "XDR type" gives the XDR type of the data
      structure used to describe the information in this new message
      type.  This data overlays the nominally opaque field optinfo in an
      RDMA_OPTIONAL message.

   o  The column labeled "msg" indicates whether this operation is
      followed (or not) by an RPC message payload.

   o  The column labeled "section" indicates the section (within this
      document) that explains the semantics and use of this optional
      operation.

   Support for all of the operations above is OPTIONAL.  RPC-over-RDMA
   Version Two implementations that receive an operation that is not
   supported MUST respond with RDMA_ERROR message with an error code of
   RDMA_ERR_INVAL_OPTION as specified in [rpcrdmav2]

   The only operation support requirements are as follows:

   o  Implementations which send REQ_XCHAR messages must support
      RESP_XCHAR and UPD_XCHAR messages.

   o  Implementations which support RESP_XCHAR or UPD_XCHAR messages
      must also support INIT_XCHAR messages.

4.1.  INIT_XCHAR: Specify Initial Characteristics

   The INIT_XCHAR message type allows an RPC-over-RDMA participant,
   whether client or server, to indicate to its partner relevant
   transport characteristics that the partner might need to be aware of.

   The message definition for this operation is as follows:

   <CODE BEGINS>

   const uint32     ROPT_INITXCH = 1;

   struct optinfo_initxch {
           xcharspec       optixc_start;
           xcharsubset     optixc_nochg;
   };

   <CODE ENDS>

   All relevant transport characteristics that the sender is aware of
   should be included in optixc_start.  Since support of this request is
   OPTIONAL, and since each of the characteristics is OPTIONAL as well,
   the sender cannot assume that the receiver will necessarily take note
   of these characteristics and so the sender should be prepared for
   cases in which the partner continues to assume that the default value
   for a particular characteristic is still in effect.

   The subset of transport characteristic specified by optixc_nochg is
   not expected to change during the lifetime of the connection.

   Generally, a participant will send an INIT_XCHAR message as the first
   message after a connection is established.  Given that fact, the
   sender should make sure that the message can be received by partners
   who use the default Receive Buffer Size.  The connection's initial
   receive buffer size is typically 1KB, but it depends on the initial
   connection state of the RPC-over-RDMA version in use.  See
   [rpcrdmav2] for details.

   Those receiving an INIT_XCHAR may encounter characteristics that they
   do not support or are unaware of.  In such cases, these
   characteristics are simply ignored without any error response being
   generated.

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


4.2.  REQ_XCHAR: Request Modification of Characteristics

   The REQ_XCHAR message type allows an RPC-over-RDMA participant,
   whether client or server, to request of its partner that relevant
   transport characteristics be changed.

   The partner need not change the characteristics as requested by the
   sender but if it does support the message type, it will generate a
   RESP_XCHAR message, indicating the disposition of the request.

   The message definition for this operation is as follows:

   <CODE BEGINS>

   const uint32     ROPT_REQXCH = 2;

   struct optinfo_reqxch {
           xcharspec       optrqxc_want;
   };

   <CODE ENDS>

   The xcharspec optrqxc_want is a set of transport characteristics
   together with the desired values requested by the sender.

4.3.  RESP_XCHAR: Respond to Request to Modify Transport Characteristics

   The RESP_XCHAR message type allows an RPC-over-RDMA participant to
   respond to a request to change characteristics by its partner,
   indicating how the request was dealt with.

   The message definition for this operation is as follows:

   <CODE BEGINS>

   const uint32     ROPT_RESPXCH = 3;

   struct optinfo_respxch {
           xcharsubset     optrsxc_done;
           xcharsubset     optrsxc_rej;
           xcharsubset     optrsxc_pend;
   };

   <CODE ENDS>

   The rdma_xid field of this message must match that used in the
   REQ_XCHAR message to which this message is responding.

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   The optrsxc_done field indicates which of the requested transport
   characteristic changes have been immediately effected.  For each such
   characteristic, the receiver is entitled to conclude that the
   requested change has been made and that future transmissions may be
   made based on the new value.

   The optrsxc_rej field indicates which of the requested transport
   characteristic changes have been rejected by the sender.  This may be
   because of any of the following reasons:

   o  The particular characteristic specified is not known or supported
      by the receiver of the ROPT_REQXCH message.

   o  The implementation receiving the ROPT_REQXCH message does not
      support modification of this characteristic.

   o  The implementation receiving the ROPT_REQXCHG message has rejected
      the modification for another reason.

   The optrsxc_pend field indicates which of the requested transport
   characteristic modifications remain pending, since they were neither
   rejected nor effected immediately.  The receiver can expect the
   modification to be effected by a later ROPT_UPDXCH message, although
   there is no way to determine when this will happen

   The subsets of characteristics specified by optrsxc_done,
   optrsxc_rej, optrsxc_pend should not overlap and, when ored together,
   should cover the entire set of characteristics specified by
   optrqxc_want in the corresponding request.

4.4.  UPD_XCHAR: Update Transport Characteristics

   The UPD_XCHAR message type allows an RPC-over-RDMA participant to
   notify the other participant that a change to the transport
   characteristics has occurred.

   This may be because:

   o  A change requested by a REQ_XCHAR message, has, after some delay,
      been effected.

   o  The sender has decided, independently, to modify the transport
      characteristic and is notifying the receiver of this change.

   One should pay particular attention to the fact that there is no
   there no way to tie a message reporting a change to the specific
   request which asked for the change.  In particular, the rdma_xid

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   field in this message is independent of that for any earlier
   REQ_XCHAR message.

   The message definition for this operation is as follows:


   <CODE BEGINS>

   const uint32     ROPT_UPDXCH = 4;

   struct optinfo_updxch {
           xcharval        optuxc_now;
           bool            optuxc_pendclr;
   };

   <CODE ENDS>


   optuxc_now defines the new characteristic value to be used.

   optuxc_pendclr, if true, indicates that a previous request to update
   the characteristic specified by optuxc_now.xchv_which is no longer to
   be considered pending.  This may be set true even if the
   characteristic value is not changed from the previous value.

5.  XDR

   This section contains an XDR [RFC4506]  description of the proposed
   extension.

   This description is provided in a way that makes it simple to extract
   into ready-to-use form.  The reader can apply the following shell
   script to this document to produce a machine-readable XDR description
   of extension which can be combined with XDR for the base protocol to
   produce an XDR that combines the base protocol with the optional
   extensions.


   <CODE BEGINS>

   #!/bin/sh
   grep '^ *///' | sed 's?^ /// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'

   <CODE ENDS>


   That is, if the above script is stored in a file called "extract.sh"
   and this document is in a file called "ext.txt" then the reader can

6.  Extensibility

6.1.  Additional Characteristics

   The set of transport characteristics is designed to be extensible.
   As a result, once new characteristics are defined in standards track
   documents, the operations defined in this document may reference
   these new transport characteristics, as well as the ones described in
   this document.

   A standards track document defining a new transport characteristic
   should include the following information paralleling that provided in
   this document for the transport characteristics defined herein.

   o  The xcharid value used to identify this characteristic.

   o  The XDR typedef specifying the form in which the characteristic
      value is communicated.




Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   o  A description of the transport characteristic that is communicated
      by the sender of ROPT_INITXCH and ROPT_UPDXCH and requested by the
      sender of ROP_REQXCH.

   o  An explanation of how this knowledge could be used by the
      participant receiving this information.

   o  Information giving rules governing possible changes of values of
      this characteristic.

   The definition of transport characteristic structures is such as to
   make it easy to assign unique values.  There is no requirement that a
   continuous set of values be used and implementations should not rely
   on all such values being small integers.  A unique value should be
   selected when the defining document is first published as an internet
   draft.  When the document becomes a standards track document working
   group should insure that:

   o  The xcharids specified in the document do not conflict with those
      currently assigned or in use by other pending working group
      documents defining transport characteristics.

   o  The xcharids specified in the document do not conflict with the
      range reserved for experimental use, as defined in Section 6.2.

   Documents defining new characteristics fall into a number of
   categories.

   o  Those defining new characteristics and explaining (only) how they
      affect use of existing message types.

   o  Those defining new OPTIONAL message types and new characteristics
      applicable to the operation of those new message types.

   o  Those defining new OPTIONAL message types and new characteristics
      applicable both to new and existing message types.

   When additional transport characteristics are proposed, the review of
   the associated standards track document should deal with possible
   security issues raised by those new transport characteristics.

6.2.  Experimental Characteristics

   Given the design of the transport characteristics data structure, it
   possible to use the operations to implement experimental, possibly
   unpublished, transport characteristics.





Noveck                  Expires January 31, 2017               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft   RPC-over-RDMA Transport Characteristics       July 2016


   xcharids in the range from 4,294,967,040 to 4,294,967,295 are
   reserved for experimental use and these values should not be assigned
   to new characteristics in standards track documents.

   When values in this range are used there is no guarantee if
   successful interoperation among independent implementations.

7.  Security Considerations

   Like other fields that appear in each RPC-over-RDMA header,
   characteristic information is sent in the clear on the fabric with no
   integrity protection, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
   attacks.

   For example, if a man-in-the-middle were to change the value of the
   Receive buffer size or the Requester Remote Invalidation boolean, it
   could reduce connection performance or trigger loss of connection.
   Repeated connection loss can impact performance or even prevent a new
   connection from being established.  Recourse is to deploy on a
   private network or use link-layer encryption.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions by IANA.
