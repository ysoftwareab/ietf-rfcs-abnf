Abstract

This document proposes a multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc networks,
called the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing (MZR). MZR
is a source-initiated on-demand protocol, in which a multicast delivery
tree is created using a concept based on the zone routing mechanism.
It belongs to the family of source-tree-based protocols, in which a
delivery tree rooted at the source is created for each active multicast
session.  MZR does not depend on any underlying unicast protocol for a
global routing substructure.  The protocol's reaction to topological
changes is restricted to a node's neighborhood and is not propagated
throughout the network.

Internet Draft        Multicast Protocol for MANET         19 July  2001


1. Introduction

In this document, we propose a new multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc
networks, called the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing
(MZR). MZR is a source-tree-based, source-initiated, on-demand routing
protocol, which is based on the concept of zone routing.

The zone routing mechanism was originally described in the Zone
Routing Protocol [2] developed by the Wireless Networks Lab at Cornell
University.  It is a hybrid approach between the proactive and reactive
routing protocols, where routing is proactive inside the zones (i.e., a
unicast route is proactively maintained between every pair of nodes in a
zone) and reactive between the zones (i.e., a route between two nodes in
different zones is created when needed).  This hybrid approach provides
a balance between the efficient packet delivery of proactive routing and
the low maintenance cost of reactive routing.

MZR is a source-tree-based multicast routing protocol.  For each
multicast session identified by a <source-id, group-id> pair, a
multicast delivery tree rooted at the source is created.  One advantage
of the source-tree-based routing protocols over the shared-tree-based
protocols is that they do not have a single point of failure like the
group leader (or the rendezvous point) as in the shared-tree protocols.
This is significant when it comes to ad hoc networks because of the
frequent mobility of the nodes.  Network mobility further increases the
overhead of group leader election.  Also, in the source-tree approach,
traffic is evenly distributed over the network rather than being
concentrated on the shared tree.

The MZR protocol is source-initiated, which means that a multicast
delivery tree is created when the source needs to send multicast data to
its group members; and it is on-demand, which means that the delivery
tree is created only when there is data to be sent to the group members.

MZR does not depend on any underlying unicast routing protocol for its
operation as other multicast protocols do [3, 4, 5].


2. Terminology

This protocol specification uses conventional meanings as specified in
RFC 2119 for capitalized words such as MUST, SHOULD, etc., to indicate
requirement levels for various protocol features.  Other terminology
used by the protocol are defined in this section.

      Node

         Any device participating in the ad hoc network.

      Zone Routing

         A hybrid approach combining advantages of proactive and
         reactive protocols, where routing is proactive inside the zones
         and reactive between the zones.   [2] has more details.

      Zone

         A node's local neighborhood specified by a zone radius.

      Zone radius

         Radius of each node's zone in terms of network hops.

      Border Node

         A node which is on the periphery of a zone.  The distance
         from the border node to the zone's center (to which the zone
         belongs) in terms of network hops is equal to the zone radius.

      Upstream

         The next hop on the multicast source tree towards the source of
         the multicast session.

      Downstream

         The next hop in the multicast source tree away from the source
         of the multicast session.

      Proactive Routing Protocols

         Routing protocols which constantly exchange routing information
         to keep the routing tables at each node current and up-to-date.

      Reactive Routing Protocols

         Routing protocols which do an on-demand route discovery when
         data needs to be sent to a particular destination.


3. Route Tables

MZR as a routing protocol uses the following data structures for its
operation.

Internet Draft        Multicast Protocol for MANET         19 July  2001


3.1. Zone Routing Table

Each mobile node participating in MZR maintains a Zone Routing Table,
which contains unicast routes to all nodes inside its zone.  The routing
information in this table is kept current by the proactive component
running inside each zone.  Each route entry in the zone routing table
has a timer associated with it.  If the timer expires, the corresponding
entry is removed.  A zone route entry SHOULD contain atleast the
following fields

 - Destination IP Address
 - Next Hop
 - Outgoing Interface
 - Hop Count
 - Lifetime timer
 - Routing Flags


3.2. Multicast Routing Table

A multicast routing table is maintained at each node running MZR. If a
node were on a multicast tree, identified by a <source, group> pair,
then it would have a multicast route entry corresponding to that tree.
Each multicast route entry has a timer associated with it, which is
refreshed, whenever a node gets a refresh packet on the multicast tree.
The route entry has a pointer to the upstream node towards the source.
It also has a list of downstream nodes, to which data is replicated
and forwarded.  Each multicast route entry SHOULD contain atleast the
following fields.

 - Multicast Tree id <source, group>
 - Upstream node
 - List of downstream nodes
 - Lifetime timer
 - Routing Flags


3.3. Message Cache

Each node MUST maintain a message cache for detecting duplicate data and
control packets.  A Least Recently Used (LRU) scheme MAY be used to to
prevent the cache from growing uncontrollably.


3.4. Neighbor Table

Each node SHOULD maintain a neighbor table where it stores the list of
all its one hop neighbors with the corresponding interface address to
reach them.

4. Protocol Description

MZR has two parts to it.  A proactive protocol runs inside each zone,
maintaining an up-to-date zone routing table at each node.  A reactive
multicast tree creation is initiated when a source needs to send
multicast data to its group members.  The following sections describe
the protocol.


4.1. Zone Routing

Existing routing protocols can be classified either as proactive
or reactive protocols.  Both these classes of protocols suffer from
disadvantages when it comes to ad hoc networks.  The Zone Routing
approach is a hybrid approach [2], which tries to incorporate the
advantages from both proactive and reactive protocols.  The original
Zone Routing Protocol is described in [2].  It initiates the route
determination procedure on-demand, but at limited search cost.  It
limits the scope of the proactive procedure only to the node's zone.  On
the other hand, the global search for the destination (anywhere in the
network), is done efficiently by querying only selected nodes in the
network, as opposed to querying all the network nodes.  Each node in
the network defines a zone around itself with the zone radius measured
in terms of network hops.  A zone routing table containing unicast
routes to all zone nodes is maintained at each node.  This table is kept
current by running a proactive protocol inside each zone.  The important
difference from pure proactive protocols is that the routing updates
(carrying routing information) are restricted to the zone, and are not
sent to the entire network.  For routes to destinations outside a node's
zone, a reactive route discovery process is initiated.  The beauty of
the zone routing protocol is the way in which the global flood search
algorithm is implemented.  Instead of flooding the route request packet
throughout the network, a node selectively queries its border nodes for
a route to a particular destination.  These border nodes first look in
their zones for the destination.  If not found, they query their border
nodes in turn.  The destination node eventually gets the route discovery
packet and replies to the source.

As the zone radius is significantly smaller than the network radius, the
cost of learning the zone topologies is a very small fraction of the
cost required by a global proactive mechanism.  Zone routing is also
much cheaper (in term of control traffic and congestion) and faster than
a global reactive route discovery mechanism, as the number of nodes
queried in the process is [r_zone / r_network]^2 of the number of nodes 
queried by a global flooding process (r_zone is the zone radius and 
r_network is the network radius) [2].  MZR makes use of this querying 
mechanism for building a source-based multicast delivery tree.

4.2. Zone Construction

Each mobile node participating in an ad hoc network constructs a zone
around itself with a pre-configured zone radius.  A simplified distance
vector protocol is implemented for creating zones and for maintaining
a Zone Routing Table at each node.  Every node in the mobile ad hoc
network periodically broadcasts an ADVERTISEMENT packet, identifying
itself.  The propagation of the advertisement packets is restricted
to a zone by setting the time-to-live (TTL) value of these packets to
the zone radius.  The nodes that are within the transmission range
of a node A pick up the advertisement packet sent by A. Each node
that receives an ADVERTISEMENT packet rebroadcasts it if the TTL of
the packet is still valid.  Before the packet is rebroadcasted, the
TTL of the packet is decremented by one.  When a node B receives the
advertisement packet from A, a route entry for A is created and stored
in B's zone routing table.  The distance to A from B is set to the hop
count in the advertisement packet and the next hop in the route entry is
set to the node from which B received A's advertisement packet.  A soft
state approach is followed to remove stale routes from the zone routing
table.  Route entries expire if they are not periodically refreshed by
advertisement packets from the corresponding nodes.


4.3. Zone Maintenance

The zone routing table is kept up-to-date through the proactive protocol
built on periodic advertisements.  Routes to destinations that moved
away are removed when they expire.  Routes to new destinations are added
to a node's zone routing table, when it receives advertisement packets
from these destinations.  Also, the protocol's reaction to the changes
in topology is localized to a zone.  Only the nodes within a zone are
affected and only they need to update their zone routing tables.

By looking at the zone routing table, a node can identify the interior
zone nodes and the border nodes.  If the distance metric in a route
entry is equal to the zone radius, the corresponding destination
becomes a border node.  All the other nodes, whose route entries contain
distances less than the zone radius become the interior zone nodes.
Each node SHOULD maintain a Neighbor Table, which contains all those
nodes from which a node received ADVERTISEMENT packets with a hop count
of one.


4.4. Multicast Tree Creation

For each multicast session in the ad hoc network, a tree rooted at the
source and identified by a <source, group> pair is created.  Multicast
group information is distributed separately and is not within the scope
of this protocol.  Every node maintains a multicast routing table,



Devarapalli, Selcuk, Sidhu       Expires 19 January  2002       [Page 6]

Internet Draft        Multicast Protocol for MANET         19 July  2001


which contains route entries corresponding to each active multicast
session in the ad hoc network.  A multicast route entry is identified
by the multicast session id, a <source, group> pair, and contains the
IP address of the upstream node and a list of downstream nodes on the
corresponding multicast tree.

A multicast source initiates the creation of a multicast data delivery
tree.  The tree creation is done in a two-stage process.  The source
initially tries to extend the tree inside its zone and then tries to
extend the tree to the entire network.  The corresponding data packet
and the subsequent data packets for the session are queued up for
transmission until after the tree is created.  The source sends a
TREE-CREATE to each zone node, through unicast routes obtained from the
zone routing table.  A TREE-CREATE packet is uniquely identified by the
corresponding session id.  The TTL of the TREE-CREATE packet is set
to the zone radius and decremented by one each time it is forwarded.
When the TTL becomes zero, the packet is not forwarded further.  As
the TREE-CREATE packet is propagated to a zone node, reverse route
entries are created at each intermediate node.  The reverse routes
are basically multicast route entries with the list of downstream
nodes empty and the upstream node set to the node which forwarded the
TREE-CREATE packet.  If the receiving node is not able to determine
the identity of the node which forwarded the packet based on the
interface id, it uses its zone routing table to figure out the upstream
node.  It chooses the next hop node in its zone routing entry for the
node which originated the TREE-CREATE packet.  These multicast route
entries at the intermediate nodes are set to inactive when they are
created.  When a zone node, interested in the multicast group session,
receives the TREE-CREATE packet, it creates a multicast route entry and
replies with a TREE-CREATE-ACK packet.  The TREE-CREATE-ACK is sent
to the one hop neighbor which forwarded the TREE-CREATE packet.  The
TREE-CREATE-ACK packet is finally sent back to the source through the
reverse route created by the TREE-CREATE packet.  As the TREE-CREATE-ACK
travels back to the source, the corresponding multicast route entry
at each intermediate node is completed, activated and the node from
which the TREE-CREATE-ACK was received is added to the list of the
downstream nodes.  When the multicast route entry is activated at a
node, it signals the creation of a new tree branch on which multicast
data can be forwarded.  Even nodes, which are not interested in the
multicast session, become members of the multicast tree if they provide
connectivity to downstream member nodes.  Through this mechanism, the
source succeeds in creating a multicast tree, rooted at the source and
extending throughout its zone.

Once the source is done with its zone, it tries to extend the multicast
tree to the entire network.  The source identifies all the border nodes
for its zone and sends a TREE-PROPAGATE message to each one of them.
The TTL of the TREE-PROPAGATE packet is set to the zone radius and the
packet is unicasted to the border nodes.  The TTL is decremented by one



Devarapalli, Selcuk, Sidhu       Expires 19 January  2002       [Page 7]

Internet Draft        Multicast Protocol for MANET         19 July  2001


each time the packet is forwarded.  If the TTL becomes zero, the packet
is not forwarded.  Each TREE-PROPAGATE packet is uniquely identified
by the corresponding multicast session id.  A TREE-PROPAGATE packet
basically tells a node to extend the multicast tree inside its zone.  An
optimization would be for the source to indicate to the border nodes to
propagate the tree by setting a flag in the TREE-CREATE packets sent
to them.  This will eliminate the need for separate TREE-PROPAGATE
messages.  When a border node receives a TREE-PROPAGATE packet, it
creates a multicast route entry for the session, and then sends a
TREE-CREATE packet to each of its zone nodes.  This is done, even if the
border node is not interested in the multicast session.  If a node in
the border node's zone is interested in the session, it replies to the
border node with a TREE-CREATE-ACK. The same procedure as described in
the previous section is followed to create multicast route entries at
each intermediate node.  The border node in turn sends a TREE-CREATE-ACK
packet, unicasted to the source.  This basically extends the multicast
tree into the border node's zone with a unicast link between the
source and the border node and multiple tree branches within the border
node's zone.  Once the border node is done with its zone nodes, it MUST
send a TREE-PROPAGATE message to all its border nodes.  These border
nodes in turn try to extend the multicast tree inside their zones.
This continues till every mobile node in the ad hoc network gets a
TREE-CREATE packet corresponding to the multicast tree being created.

A node can be a member of multiple routing zones at the same time
because the routing zones heavily overlap.  It is possible that a node
receives multiple TREE-CREATE and TREE-PROPAGATE messages.  This is
prevented by early detection and termination of duplicate TREE-PROPAGATE
threads.


4.5. Routing Mechanism

The source starts transmitting data packets to the group members once
the multicast delivery tree is created.  Each tree member has a valid
multicast route entry with the upstream node set to the node from
which it receives data packets and a list of downstream nodes on the
tree.  When a node on the multicast tree receives a data packet from
its upstream node, it replicates the data packet and sends a copy to
each node in the downstream list.  A node SHOULD stop transmitting data
packets to a downstream node, if the downstream node migrates and moves
out of its transmission range.


4.6. Maintaining the Multicast Tree

In a mobile ad hoc network, frequent changes in the network topology due
to node mobility can cause tree links to break.  To ensure continuous
multicast data delivery in the presence of node mobility, the multicast

Internet Draft        Multicast Protocol for MANET         19 July  2001


tree has to be reconfigured quickly.  The following sections describe
two mechanisms, one to maintain up-to-date multicast routing information
at each tree member node and another for repairing tree link breaks.


4.6.1. Tree Refresh

Each route entry in a node's multicast routing table has a timer
associated with it.  When the timer expires, the corresponding multicast
route entry is removed.  This is necessary to remove stale multicast
information.  To ensure that the multicast route entries do not
expire for the duration of the multicast session, the source MUST
send a TREE-REFRESH packet every REFRESH-INTERVAL down the tree.  The
TREE-REFRESH packet is identified by a unique session id, a <source,
group> pair.  When a tree member receives a refresh packet, it updates
the timer for the corresponding multicast route entry, and sends the
refresh packet to all the downstream nodes on the tree.  The source
stops sending refresh packets once it finishes sending all the data for
the corresponding session.  This mechanism ensures that a data delivery
tree is maintained as long as the session is active.  The source SHOULD
piggyback the refresh packet on any data packet whenever possible.


4.6.2. Reaction to Link Breaks

The downstream nodes are responsible for detecting link breaks and
reconfiguring the tree.  When a link to an upstream node breaks, the
downstream node can easily detect this by looking at its neighbor
table or the zone routing table.  A node (say, A) initiates branch
reconstruction when it loses connection to its upstream node and is
still interested in the ongoing multicast session.  The node A initiates
a search for the multicast tree by using the zone routing mechanism.  It
first sends JOIN packets to all its zone nodes.  Each JOIN is uniquely
identified by the corresponding multicast session id.  The TTL of the
JOIN packet is set to the zone radius and is decremented by one each
time it is forwarded.  The packet is not forwarded if the TTL becomes
zero.  If any of the nodes in A's zone is on the multicast tree and has
a valid multicast route entry, it replies to A with a JOIN- ACK packet.
The node, before replying with a JOIN-ACK packet adds the node from
which it received the JOIN request to the list of downstream nodes in
the corresponding multicast route entry.  Multicast route entries are
also set up at the intermediate nodes.

If node A does not get a reply from its zone nodes, it tries to
propagate its join request through the entire network, hoping it
could connect to the multicast tree through some node.  It sends a
JOIN-PROPAGATE packet to all its border nodes.  JOIN-PROPAGATEs are
restricted to the zone by setting the TTL to the zone radius.  These
border nodes in turn send join requests to their zone nodes.  If they



Devarapalli, Selcuk, Sidhu       Expires 19 January  2002       [Page 9]

Internet Draft        Multicast Protocol for MANET         19 July  2001


get a response from any of their zone nodes, they reply to A with a
JOIN-ACK. If not, they MUST send a JOIN-PROPAGATE packet to their border
nodes.  Using this mechanism, node A's join request is propagated to
the entire network.  If A does not get a reply at all, it assumes that
the network has been partitioned and it cannot connect to the existing
multicast tree.  The main advantage with this rejoin process is that the
branch reconstruction is localized if A manages to find a multicast tree
node within its zone.


4.7. Tree Prunes

Group membership is dynamic, where nodes are free to join and leave
the multicast session in progress.  When a tree member is no longer
interested in the group, it sends an explicit PRUNE message to its
upstream node, which in turn removes it from its list of downstream
nodes.  If the downstream list becomes empty as a result of this action
and the node itself is not interested in the group, it sends an explicit
prune message to its upstream node.


4.8. Joining a Multicast Session

Joining a multicast session is very similar to the mechanism in which
a node which loses connection to its upstream node tries to rejoin the
tree.


5. Message Formats

This following sections describe the message formats for the messages
used by MZR. Note that MZR is a protocol under development.  The
following message formats are not final and could be changed in the next
versions of this draft.


5.1. ADVERTISEMENT

ADVERTISEMENT messages are used by the unicast routing protocol running

6. Configurable Parameters

The following are some of the important parameters that would affect the
performance of the protocol.  The default values for these parameters
are specified in this section.  Each mobile node MAY modify these
parameters if required.

        Parameters              Default Values
        ----------              --------------
        ZONE_RADIUS             2
        REFRESH_INTERVAL        5 seconds
        ADVERTISE_INTERVAL      1 second
        ZONE_ROUTE_TIMEOUT      3 * ADVERTISE_INTERVAL


7. Security Considerations

The security to any routing protocol, including MZR, requires a
mechanism for the authentication of the routers (i.e., nodes) in the
network.  The specifics of the routing security mechanism to be deployed
would depend on the specifics of the underlying node authentication

mechanism available (a public-key infrastructure, or a Kerboros-like
secret-key authentication system, etc.).  At this point, MZR does not
specify any security mechanism.
