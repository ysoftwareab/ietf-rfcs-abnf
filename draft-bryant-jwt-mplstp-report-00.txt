Internet-Draft             JWT MPLS-TP Report                  June 2008


1.  Introduction

   For a number of years the ITU-T has been designing a label switched
   protocol to be used in Transport Networks.  A Transport Network can
   be considered to be the network that provides wide area connectivity
   upon which other services such IP, or the phone network run.  The
   ITU-T chose to adapt the IETF's MPLS to this task, and introduced a
   protocol suite known as T-MPLS.

   Quite late in the ITU-T design and specification cycle, there were a
   number of liaison exchanges between the ITU-T and the IETF concerning
   this technology [T-MPLS1], and the chairs of the MPLS, PWE3, BFD and
   CCAMP working groups as well as the Routing and Internet Area
   Directors attended a number of ITU-T meetings.  During this process
   the IETF became increasingly concerned that the incompatibility of
   IETF MPLS and ITU-T T-MPLS would lead to a "train wreck on the
   Internet".  These concerns led the chairs of the IESG and IAB to take
   the step of sending a liaison to the ITU-T, stating that either
   T-MPLS should become and fully compliant MPLS protocol, standardized
   under the IETF process (the so called "Option 1"), or it should
   become a completely disjoint protocol with a new name and completely
   new set of code points (the so called "Option 2")[Ethertypes].

   Option 1 and Option 2 were discussed at an ITU-T meeting of Question
   12 Study Group 15 in Stuttgart [Stuttgart], where it was proposed
   that a Joint (ITU-T - IETF) Team should be formed to evaluate the
   issues, and make a recommendation to ITU-T management on the best way
   forward.

   Following discussion between the management of the IETF and the ITU-T
   a Joint Working Team (JWT) was established, this was supported by an
   IETF Design Team and an Ad Hoc Group on T-MPLS in the ITU-T
   [ahtmpls].  The first meeting of the Ad Hoc group occurred during the
   ITU-T Geneva Plenary in February this year.  As a result of the work
   of the JWT and the resulting agreement on a way forward, the fears
   that a set of next-generation network transport specifications
   developed by ITU-T could cause interoperability problems were
   allayed.

   The JWT submitted their report to ITU-T and IETF management in the
   form of a set of powerpoint slides [MPLS-TP-22] [ALSO INCLUDE SELF
   REF TO PDF WHEN AVALIABLE].  The ITU-T have accepted this
   recommendation, as documented in [MPLS-TP].  This RFC archives the
   JWT report in a format that is accessable to the IETF.

   There are two versions of this RFC.  An ASCII version that contains a
   summary of the slides and a pdf version that contains the summary and
   a copy of the slides.  In the case of a conflict between the summary

   and the slides, the slides have normacy.  Since those slides were the
   basis of an important agreement between the the IETF and the ITU-T,
   it should further be noted that In the event that the pdf verson of
   the slides differ from those emailed to ITU-T and IETF management on
   18th April 2008 by the co-chairs of the JWT, the emailed slides have
   normacy.


2.  Executive Summary

   Slides 4 to 10 provide an executive summary of the JWT Report.  The
   following is a summary of those slides:

   The JWT acheived consensus on the recommendation of Option 1: to
   jointly agree to work together and bring transport requirements into
   the IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding, OAM, survivability, network
   management and control plane protocols to meet those requirements
   through the IETF Standards Process.  The Joint Working Team believed
   that this would fulfill the mutual goal of improving the
   functionality of the transport networks and the internet and
   guaranteeing complete interoperability and architectural soundness.
   This technolgy would be refered to as the Transport Profile for MPLS
   (MPLS-TP)

   The JWT recommend that future work should focus on:

   In the IETF:

      Definition of the MPLS "Transport Profile" (MPLS-TP)

   In the ITU-T:

      Integration of MPLS-TP into the transport network

      Alignment of the current T-MPLS Recommendations with MPLS-TP and,

      Terminate the work on current T-MPLS

   The technical feasibility analysis demonstrated there were no "show
   stopper" issues in the recommendation of Option 1 and that the IETF
   MPLS and Pseudowire architecture could be extended to support
   transport functional requirements.  Therefore the team believed that
   there was no need for the analysis of any other option.

   The JWT proposed that the MPLS Interoperability Design Team (MEAD
   Team), JWT and ad hoc T-MPLS groups continue as described in SG15
   TD515/PLEN [JWTcreation] with the following roles:

Internet-Draft             JWT MPLS-TP Report                  June 2008


      Facilitate the rapid exchange of information between the IETF and
      ITU-T

      Ensure that the work is progressing with a consistent set of
      priorities

      Identify gaps/inconsistencies in the solutions under development

      Propose solutions for consideration by the appropriate WG/Question

      Provide guidance when work on a topic is stalled or technical
      decision must be mediated

   None of these groups would have the authority to create or modify
   IETF RFCs or ITU-T Recommendations.  Any such work would be
   progressed via the normal process of the respective standards body.
   Direct participation in the work by experts from the IETF and ITU-T
   would be required.

   The JWT recommended that the normative definition of the MPLS-TP that
   supports the ITU-T transport network requirements will be captured in
   IETF RFCs.  It proposed that the ITU-T should:

      Develop Recommendations to allow MPLS-TP to be integrated with
      current transport equipment and networks Including in agreement
      with the IETF, the definition of any ITU-T specific functionality
      within the MPLS-TP architecture via the MPLS change process (RFC
      4929)

      Revise existing Recommendations to align with MPLS-TP

      ITU-T Recommendations will make normative references to the
      appropriate RFCs

   The executive summary contains a number of detailed recommendations
   to both IETF and ITU-T management together with proposed document
   structure and timetable.

   These recommendations were accepted by ITU-T management [REF]


3.  Introduction and Background Material

   Slides 11 to 22 provide introductory and background material.

   The starting point of the analysis was to attempt to satisfy option 1
   by showing the high level architecture, any show stoppers and the
   design points that would need to be addressed after the decision has

Internet-Draft             JWT MPLS-TP Report                  June 2008


   been made to work together.  Option 1 was stated as preferred by the
   IETF and because Option 1 was shown to be feasible, Option 2 was not
   explored.

   The work was segmented into five groups looking at: Forwarding, OAM,
   Protection, Control Plane and Network Management.  The outcome of
   each review was reported in following sections and is summarised
   below.

   There followed a detailed description of the overall requirements and
   architectural assumptions that would be used in the remainder of the
   work.


4.  High Level Architecture

   Slides 23 to 28 provide a high level architectural view of the
   proposed design.

   The spectrum of services that MPLS-TP needs to address and the wider
   MPLS context is described, together with the provisioning issues.
   Some basic terminology needed to understand the MPLS-TP is defined
   and some context examples provided.


5.  OAM and Forwarding

   Slides 29 to 32 describe the OAM requirements and talk about segment
   recovery and node identification.

   Slides 33 to 38 introduce OAM hierarchy and describe LSP monitoring,
   the MEP and MIP relationship and the LSP and PW monitoring
   relationship.

   Sides 39 to 46 introduce the Associated Channel Header and its
   generalisation to carry the OAM over LSPs through the use of the
   "Label for You" (LFU).

   Slides 47 to 48 provide a didactic description of how the forwarding
   and the ACH OAM mechanism work in detail.  A significant number of
   scenarios are described to work through the operation on a case by
   case basis.  These slides introduce a new textual notation to
   simplify the description of complex MPLS stacks.

   Note that the MPLS forwarding, as specified by the IETF RFCs,
   requires no changes to support MPLS-TP

6.  Control Plane

   Sides 79 to 83 discuss various aspects of the control plane design.

   Control plane sub-team stated that existing IETF protocols can be
   used to provide required functions for transport network operation
   and DCN/SCN operation.  IETF GMPLS protocols have already applied to
   ASON architecture, and the JWT considered that any protocol
   extensions needed will be easy to make.  The slides provide a number
   of scenarios to demonstrate this conclusion.


7.  Survivability

   The survivability considerations are provided in slides 95 to 104

   Survivability sub-team did nit find any issues that prevented the
   creation of an MPLS-TP, and therefore recommended that Option 1 be
   selected.  Three potential solutions were identified.  Each solutions
   has different attributes and advantages, and thought that further
   work in the design phase should eliminate one or more of these
   options and/or provide an applicability statement.

   After some clarifications and discussion there follow in the slide
   set a number of linear and ring protection scenarios with examples of
   how they might be addressed.


8.  Network Management

   Slide 106 States the conclusion of the Network Management sub team :
   that they found no issues that prevent the creation of an MPLS-TP and
   hence Option 1 can be selected.


9.  Summary

   Slide 113 Provides a summary of the JWT report.

   The JWT found no show stoppers and everyone was in agreement that
   they had identified a viable solution.  They therefore recommend
   Option 1.  They stated that in their view it is technically feasible
   that the existing MPLS architecture can be extended to meet the
   requirements of a Transport profile, and that the architecture allows
   for a single OAM technology for LSPs, PWs and a deeply nested
   network.  From probing various ITU-T Study Groups and IETF Working
   Groups it appears that MPLS reserved label 14 has had wide enough
   implementation and deployment that the solution may have to use a

Internet-Draft             JWT MPLS-TP Report                  June 2008


   different reserved label (e.g.  Label 13).  The JWT recommended that
   extensions to Label 14 should cease.

   The JWT further recommended that this architecture appeared to
   subsume Y.1711 since the requirements can be met by the mechanism
   proposed in their report.


10.  IANA considerations

   There are no IANA considerations that arise from this draft.

   Any IANA allocations needed to implement the JWT recommendation will
   be requested in the standards track RFCs that define the MPLS-TP
   protocol.


11.  Security Considerations

   The only security consideration that arises as a result of this RFC
   is the need to ensure that this is a faithful representation of the
   JWT report.

   The protocol work that arises from this agreement will have technical
   security requirements which will be identified in the RFCs that
   define MPLS-TP.


12.  The JWT Report

   In the PDF version of this RFC [REF to PDF VERSION] there follows the
   JWT report as a set of slides.
