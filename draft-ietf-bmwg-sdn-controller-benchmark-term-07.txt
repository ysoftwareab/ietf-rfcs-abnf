          Terminology for Benchmarking SDN Controller Performance
             draft-ietf-bmwg-sdn-controller-benchmark-term-07


Abstract

   This document defines terminology for benchmarking an SDN
   controller's control plane performance. It extends the terminology
   already defined in RFC 7426 for the purpose of benchmarking SDN
   controllers. The terms provided in this document help to benchmark
   SDN controller's performance independent of the controller's
   supported protocols and/or network services. A mechanism for
   benchmarking the performance of SDN controllers is defined in the
   companion methodology document. These two documents provide a
   standard mechanism to measure and evaluate the performance of
   various controller implementations.

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Terminology     January 2018


1. Introduction

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a networking architecture in
   which network control is decoupled from the underlying forwarding
   function and is placed in a centralized location called the SDN
   controller. The SDN controller provides an abstraction of the
   underlying network and offers a global view of the overall network
   to applications and business logic. Thus, an SDN controller provides
   the flexibility to program, control, and manage network behaviour
   dynamically through standard interfaces. Since the network controls
   are logically centralized, the need to benchmark the SDN controller
   performance becomes significant. This document defines terms to
   benchmark various controller designs for performance, scalability,
   reliability and security, independent of northbound and southbound
   protocols.

   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2. Term Definitions

2.1. SDN Terms

   The terms defined in this section are extensions to the terms
   defined in [RFC7426] "Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Layers and
   Architecture Terminology". This RFC should be referred before
   attempting to make use of this document.

2.1.1. Flow

Definition:
   The definition of Flow is same as microflows defined in [RFC4689]
   Section 3.1.5.

Discussion:
   A flow can be set of packets having same source address, destination
   address, source port and destination port, or any of these
   combinations.

Measurement Units:
   N/A

See Also:
   None

2.1.2. Northbound Interface

Definition:
   The definition of northbound interface is same Service Interface
   defined in [RFC7426] .

Discussion:
   The northbound interface allows SDN applications and orchestration
   systems to program and retrieve the network information through the
   SDN controller.

Measurement Units:
   N/A

See Also:
   None

2.1.3. Controller Forwarding Table

Definition:
   A controller forwarding table contains flow entries learned in one
   of two ways: first, entries could be learned from traffic received
   through the data plane, or second, these entries could be statically
   provisioned on the controller and distributed to devices via the
   southbound interface.

Discussion:
   The controller forwarding table has an aging mechanism which will be
   applied only for dynamically learned entries.

Measurement Units:
   N/A

See Also:
   None

2.1.4. Proactive Flow Provisioning Mode

Definition:
   Controller programming flows in Network Devices based on the flow
   entries provisioned through controller's northbound interface.

Discussion:
   Orchestration systems and SDN applications can define the network
   forwarding behaviour by programming the controller using proactive
   flow provisioning. The controller can then program the Network
   Devices with the pre-provisioned entries.

2.1.5. Reactive Flow Provisioning Mode

Definition:
   Controller programming flows in Network Devices based on the traffic
   received from Network Devices through controller's southbound
   interface

Discussion:

2.1.9. Asynchronous Message

Definition:
   Any message from the Network Device that is generated for network
   events.

Discussion:

   classified as asynchronous message. The controller has to return a
   response message. Note that the Network Device will not be in
   blocking mode and continues to send/receive other control messages.

Measurement Units:

   The test needs to be repeated for multiple iterations to obtain a
   reliable metric. It is recommended that this test SHOULD be
   performed for at least 10 iterations to increase the confidence in
   measured result.

Measurement Units:
   N/A

See Also:
   None


2.2.3. Trial Duration


   Definition:
   Defines the duration of test trials for each iteration.

2.3. Benchmarking Terms

   This section defines metrics for benchmarking the SDN controller.
   The procedure to perform the defined metrics is defined in the
   accompanying methodology document[I-D.sdn-controller-benchmark-meth]

2.3.1. Performance

2.3.1.1. Network Topology Discovery Time

Definition:
   The time taken by controller(s) to determine the complete network
   topology, defined as the interval starting with the first discovery
   message from the controller(s) at its Southbound interface, ending
   with all features of the static topology determined.

Discussion:
   Network topology discovery is key for the SDN controller to
   provision and manage the network. So it is important to measure how
   quickly the controller discovers the topology to learn the current
   network state. This benchmark is obtained by presenting a network
   topology (Tree, Mesh or Linear) with the given number of nodes to
   the controller and wait for the discovery process to complete. It is
   expected that the controller supports network discovery mechanism
   and uses protocol messages for its discovery process.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds

See Also:
   None


2.3.1.2. Asynchronous Message Processing Time

Definition:
   The time taken by controller(s) to process an asynchronous message,
   defined as the interval starting with an asynchronous message from a
   network device after the discovery of all the devices by the
   controller(s), ending with a response message from the controller(s)
   at its Southbound interface.


Discussion:
   For SDN to support dynamic network provisioning, it is important to
   measure how quickly the controller responds to an event triggered
   from the network. The event could be any notification messages


Bhuvan, et al           Expires June 10, 2018                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Terminology     January 2018


   generated by an Network Device upon arrival of a new flow, link down
   etc. This benchmark is obtained by sending asynchronous messages
   from every connected Network Devices one at a time for the defined
   trial duration. This test assumes that the controller will respond
   to the received asynchronous message.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds

See Also:
   None


2.3.1.3. Asynchronous Message Processing Rate

Definition:
   The number responses to asynchronous messages (such as new flow
   arrival notification message, etc.) for which the controller(s)
   performed processing and replied with a valid and productive (non-
   trivial) response message.


Discussion:
   As SDN assures flexible network and agile provisioning, it is
   important to measure how many network events the controller can
   handle at a time. This benchmark is obtained by sending asynchronous
   messages from every connected Network Device at the rate that the
   controller processes (without dropping them). This test assumes that
   the controller responds to all the received asynchronous messages
   (the messages can be designed to elicit individual responses).

   When sending asynchronous messages to the controller(s) at high
   rates, some messages or responses may be discarded or corrupted and
   require retransmission to controller(s). Therefore, a useful
   qualification on Asynchronous Message Processing Rate is whether the
   in-coming message count equals the response count in each trial.
   This is called the Loss-free Asynchronous Message Processing Rate.

   Note that several of the early controller benchmarking tools did not
   consider lost messages, and instead report the maximum response
   rate. This is called the Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing
   Rate.

   To characterize both the Loss-free and Maximum Rates, a test could
   begin the first trial by sending asynchronous messages to the
   controller(s) at the maximum possible rate and record the message
   reply rate and the message loss rate. The message sending rate is


Bhuvan, et al           Expires June 10, 2018                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Terminology     January 2018


   then decreased by the step-size. The message reply rate and the
   message loss rate are recorded. The test ends with a trial where the
   controller(s) processes the all asynchronous messages sent without
   loss. This is the Loss-free Asynchronous Message Processing Rate.

   The trial where the controller(s) produced the maximum response rate
   is the Maximum Asynchronous Message Processing Rate. Of course, the
   first trial could begin at a low sending rate with zero lost
   responses, and increase until the Loss-free and Maximum Rates are
   discovered.

Measurement Units:
   Messages processed per second.

See Also:
   None

2.3.1.4. Reactive Path Provisioning Time

Definition:
   The time taken by the controller to setup a path reactively between
   source and destination node, defined as the interval starting with
   the first flow provisioning request message received by the
   controller(s), ending with the last flow provisioning response
   message sent from the controller(s) at it Southbound interface.

Discussion:
   As SDN supports agile provisioning, it is important to measure how
   fast that the controller provisions an end-to-end flow in the
   dataplane. The benchmark is obtained by sending traffic from a
   source endpoint to the destination endpoint, finding the time
   difference between the first and the last flow provisioning message
   exchanged between the controller and the Network Devices for the
   traffic path.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds.

See Also:
   None

2.3.1.5. Proactive Path Provisioning Time

Definition:
   The time taken by the controller to proactively setup a path between
   source and destination node, defined as the interval starting with
   the first proactive flow provisioned in the controller(s) at its


Bhuvan, et al           Expires June 10, 2018                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft SDN Controller Benchmarking Terminology     January 2018


   Northbound interface, ending with the last flow provisioning command
   message sent from the controller(s) at it Southbound interface.

Discussion:
   For SDN to support pre-provisioning of traffic path from
   application, it is important to measure how fast that the controller
   provisions an end-to-end flow in the dataplane. The benchmark is
   obtained by provisioning a flow on controller's northbound interface
   for the traffic to reach from a source to a destination endpoint,
   finding the time difference between the first and the last flow
   provisioning message exchanged between the controller and the
   Network Devices for the traffic path.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds.

See Also:
   None

2.3.1.6. Reactive Path Provisioning Rate

Definition:
   The maximum number of independent paths a controller can
   concurrently establish between source and destination nodes
   reactively, defined as the number of paths provisioned by the
   controller(s) at its Southbound interface for the flow provisioning
   requests received for path provisioning at its Southbound interface
   between the start of the trial and the expiry of given trial
   duration.


Discussion:
   For SDN to support agile traffic forwarding, it is important to
   measure how many end-to-end flows that the controller could setup in
   the dataplane. This benchmark is obtained by sending traffic each
   with unique source and destination pairs from the source Network
   Device and determine the number of frames received at the
   destination Network Device.

Measurement Units:
   Paths provisioned per second.

See Also:
   None

2.3.1.7. Proactive Path Provisioning Rate

Definition:
   Measure the maximum number of independent paths a controller can
   concurrently establish between source and destination nodes
   proactively, defined as the number of paths provisioned by the
   controller(s) at its Southbound interface for the paths provisioned
   in its Northbound interface between the start of the trial and the
   expiry of given trial duration.

Discussion:
   For SDN to support pre-provisioning of traffic path for a larger
   network from the application, it is important to measure how many
   end-to-end flows that the controller could setup in the dataplane.
   This benchmark is obtained by sending traffic each with unique
   source and destination pairs from the source Network Device. Program
   the flows on controller's northbound interface for traffic to reach
   from each of the unique source and destination pairs and determine
   the number of frames received at the destination Network Device.

Measurement Units:
   Paths provisioned per second.

See Also:
   None

2.3.1.8. Network Topology Change Detection Time

Definition:
   The amount of time required for the controller to detect any changes
   in the network topology, defined as the interval starting with the
   notification message received by the controller(s) at its Southbound
   interface, ending with the first topology rediscovery messages sent
   from the controller(s) at its Southbound interface.

Discussion:
   In order to for the controller to support fast network failure
   recovery, it is critical to measure how fast the controller is able
   to detect any network-state change events. This benchmark is
   obtained by triggering a topology change event and measuring the
   time controller takes to detect and initiate a topology re-discovery
   process.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds

2.3.2. Scalability

2.3.2.1. Control Sessions Capacity

Definition:
   Measure the maximum number of control sessions the controller can
   maintain, defined as the number of sessions that the controller can
   accept from network devices, starting with the first control
   session, ending with the last control session that the controller(s)
   accepts at its Southbound interface.


Discussion:
   Measuring the controller's control sessions capacity is important to
   determine the controller's system and bandwidth resource
   requirements. This benchmark is obtained by establishing control
   session with the controller from each of the Network Device until it
   fails. The number of sessions that were successfully established
   will provide the Control Sessions Capacity.

Measurement Units:
   N/A

See Also:
   None

2.3.2.2. Network Discovery Size

Definition:
   Measure the network size (number of nodes, links and hosts) that a
   controller can discover, defined as the size of a network that the
   controller(s) can discover, starting from a network topology given
   by the user for discovery, ending with the topology that the
   controller(s) could successfully discover.


Discussion:
   For optimal network planning, it is key to measure the maximum
   network size that the controller can discover. This benchmark is
   obtained by presenting an initial set of Network Devices for
   discovery to the controller. Based on the initial discovery, the
   number of Network Devices is increased or decreased to determine the
   maximum nodes that the controller can discover.

Measurement Units:

   N/A

See Also:
   None

2.3.2.3. Forwarding Table Capacity

Definition:
   The maximum number of flow entries that a controller can manage in
   its Forwarding table.

Discussion:
   It is significant to measure the capacity of controller's Forwarding
   Table to determine the number of flows that controller could forward
   without flooding/dropping. This benchmark is obtained by
   continuously presenting the controller with new flow entries through
   reactive or proactive flow provisioning mode until the forwarding
   table becomes full. The maximum number of nodes that the controller
   can hold in its Forwarding Table will provide Forwarding Table
   Capacity.

Measurement Units:
   Maximum number of flow entries managed.

See Also:
   None


2.3.3. Security

2.3.3.1. Exception Handling

Definition:
   To determine the effect of handling error packets and notifications
   on performance tests.

Discussion:
   This benchmark test is to be performed after obtaining the baseline
   performance of the performance tests defined in Section 2.3.1. This
   benchmark determines the deviation from the baseline performance due
   to the handling of error or failure messages from the connected
   Network Devices.

Measurement Units:
   N/A

2.3.3.2. Denial of Service Handling


Definition:
   To determine the effect of handling denial of service (DoS) attacks
   on performance and scalability tests.

Discussion:
   This benchmark test is to be performed after obtaining the baseline
   performance of the performance and scalability tests defined in
   section 2.3.1 and section 2.3.1.. This benchmark determines the
   deviation from the baseline performance due to the handling of
   denial of service attacks on controller.

Measurement Units:
   Deviation of baseline metrics while handling Denial of Service
   Attacks.

2.3.4. Reliability

2.3.4.1. Controller Failover Time

Definition:
   The time taken to switch from an active controller to the backup
   controller, when the controllers work in redundancy mode and the
   active controller fails, defined as the interval starting with the
   active controller bringing down, ending with the first re-discovery
   message received from the new controller at its Southbound
   interface.

Discussion:
   This benchmark determine the impact of provisioning new flows when
   controllers are teamed and the active controller fails.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds.

2.3.4.2. Network Re-Provisioning Time

Definition:
   The time taken to re-route the traffic by the Controller, when there
   is a failure in existing traffic paths, defined as the interval
   starting from the first failure notification message received by the
   controller, ending with the last flow re-provisioning message sent
   by the controller at its Southbound interface .

Discussion:
   This benchmark determines the controller's re-provisioning ability
   upon network failures. This benchmark test assumes the following:
              i. Network topology supports redundant path between
                  source and destination endpoints.
             ii. Controller does not pre-provision the redundant path.

Measurement Units:
   milliseconds.
