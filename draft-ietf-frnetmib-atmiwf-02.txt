Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC
        2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine

Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


2.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for
   monitoring and controlling a service interworking function (IWF) for
   Permanent Virtual Connections (PVC) between Frame Relay and
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technologies.  The agreements on
   which this MIB is based were reached jointly by the Frame Relay Forum
   and the ATM Forum and are documented in the Frame Relay Forum
   Document FRF.8 [17].


2.1.  Frame Relay/ATM Service Interworking Background

   Frame relay to ATM interworking is a function that exchanges Protocol
   Data Units (PDU) between a Frame Relay service user and an ATM
   service user.  Two types of interworking functions are specified for
   frame relay and ATM permanent virtual connection (PVC) service users:
   network interworking [20] and service interworking [17].

   Network interworking provides PDU forwarding between frame relay
   service users inter-connected by an ATM service. Both endpoints are
   frame relay PVCs.

   Service interworking provides PDU forwarding so that the ATM service
   user performs no frame relaying service-specific functions and the
   frame relay service user performs no ATM service-specific functions.
   Optionally, the service IWF translates particular higher layer
   protocols to satisfy the requirements of end-systems.

   This MIB describes management objects used to provision, monitor, and
   control a Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.

   Consult FRF.8 [17] for more details on the operation of a Frame
   Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.


2.2.  Structure of the MIB

   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF managed objects are organized in
   two tables:

    (1) FR/ATM PVC Service IWF cross-connect table

    (2) Connection description table


Expires December 1999                                           [Page 6]


Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


   The IWF cross-connect table contains one or more rows for each
   inter-worked connection. Each inter-worked connection is uniquely
   identified by the frAtmIwfConnectionIndex object. In the case of
   point-to-point, a single row is present. In the case of point-to-
   multipoint, one row exists for each multipoint destination. Index
   objects for the ATM port, VPI, VCI, Frame Relay port, and frame relay
   DLCI distinguish the constituent rows used in a point-to-multipoint
   case.

   Each inter-worked connection has attributes governing behavior of the
   IWF. These attributes describe how the IWF should transform a PDU
   during the forwarding process and provide rules for:

    (1) Mapping the ATM CLP bit to frame relay DE bit

    (2) Mapping the ATM congestion notification bit to frame relay
        congestion bits

    (3) Mapping higher protocol encapsulations between ATM and frame
        relay

    (4) Performing fragmentation and reassembly

    (5) Performing ARP translation between ATM and frame relay

   Typically, most connections share the same attributes. The attributes
   are represented in this MIB by the connection description table. Each
   row of the connection description table contains the attribute
   settings common to one or more inter-worked connections. One example
   would be full mapping and translation. All cross-connect table
   entries that require full mapping and translation services set the
   frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor object to the index value for the
   connection description table row that contains objects set to values
   that provide full mapping and translation services.

   A notification object provides cross-connect status change alerts.


2.3.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB describes the cross-
   connections between frame relay and ATM service users. Each PVC
   endpoint is provisioned and managed with a technology-specific MIB as
   described below.


Expires December 1999                                           [Page 7]


Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


   Each technology-specific MIB has a table of PVC endpoints (indexed by
   ifIndex and logical link address (DLCI or VPI/VCI). Typically, two
   endpoints are cross-connected via a technology-specific cross connect
   table. The introduction of the FR/ATM MIB creates the need to have
   multiple cross-connect tables. As an example, an ATM PVC endpoint
   might be connected to either:

    (1) another ATM PVC endpoint via the atmVcCrossConnectTable, or

    (2) a frame relay PVC endpoint via the frAtmIwfConnectionTable.

   This issue is not restricted to the case of frame relay to ATM
   interworking. An implementation supporting the ATM Forum Circuit
   Emulation Service (CES) is another example of an ATM VPI/VCI that is
   not cross-connected via the atmVcCrossConnectTable.

   Currently, the implicit assumption is made that all PVC endpoints are
   cross-connected via a single cross-connect table. This restriction is
   being removed via the specifications of this FR/ATM PVC Service IWF
   MIB. (for detailed description follow the next three sections).


2.3.1.  Frame Relay Service MIB

   Frame relay PVC endpoints are provisioned as rows in the Frame Relay
   Services MIB [19] endpoint table.

   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB cross-connect table is used
   to cross-connect the frame relay and ATM PVCs. Consequently, the
   frame relay PVC connect table does not contain an entry for the
   inter-worked connection and the object frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier is
   set to zero for the frame relay PVC endpoint at the initialization
   state. Upon completion of the IWF cross-connect creation and
   activation, the system will update this object to point to the cross
   connect index of the relevant row in the frAtmIwfConnectionTable  in
   the FR/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB.

   To remove the restriction specified above (section 2.3) one new
   object has been added for each PVC endpoint row, in the Frame Relay
   Service MIB. [EDITORS NOTE:  This anticipates a future change to the
   Frame Relay Service MIB] The object (named frPVCIwfKind) serves to
   identify the cross-connect table associated with the PVC endpoint.
   The object has an OID value that matches the OID of the IWF MIB
   cross-connect table that applies (e.g., OID of
   frAtmIwfConnectionTable). A value of zero (or noSuchObject) indicates

Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


   cross-connection via the technology-specific cross-connect table.


2.3.2.  Frame Relay DTE MIB

   The Frame Relay DTE MIB described in [19] has no relevance to the
   FR/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB.


2.3.3.  ATM MIB

   ATM PVC endpoints are provisioned as rows in the ATM MIB [21] virtual
   connection link table.

   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB cross-connect table is used
   to cross-connect the ATM and frame relay PVCs. Consequently, the ATM
   virtual connection link table does not contain an entry for the
   inter-worked connection and the object atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier
   is set to zero for the ATM PVC endpoint at the initialization state.
   Upon completion of the IWF cross-connect creation and activation, the
   system will update this object to point to the cross connect index of
   the relevant row in the frAtmIwfConnectionTable  in the FR/ATM PVC
   Service IWF MIB.

   To remove the restriction specified above (section 2.3) one new
   object has been added for each PVC endpoint row, in the ATM MIB. The
   object (named atmPVCIwfKind) serves to identify the cross-connect
   table associated with the PVC endpoint. [EDITORS NOTE:  This
   anticipates a future change to the ATM MIB] The object has an OID
   value that matches the OID of the IWF MIB cross-connect table that
   applies (e.g., OID of frAtmIwfConnectionTable). A value of zero (or
   noSuchObject) indicates cross-connection via the technology-specific
   cross-connect table.


2.4.  Point to Multipoint Considerations

   This MIB supports IWF implementations providing point-to-multipoint
   functionality. All rows of the cross-connect table indexed by the
   same frAtmIwfConnectionIndex MUST utilize the same
   frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor value.

   A group of cross-connect table entries indexed by the same
   frAtmIwfConnectionIndex value MUST agree on which service the
   multipoint operation is offered. Two cases are possible:

    (1) Many frame relay PVCs cross-connected to one ATM PVC, or

    (2) One frame relay PVC cross-connected to many ATM PVCs

2.5.  Theory of Operation

2.5.1.  Creation Process

   To successfully create a cross connect entry multiple steps are
   required. First the endpoints must be established and set to
   administrative status 'up'. Secondly the cross connect descriptor
   should be defined, and last, the cross connect entry should be fully
   defined and set to administrative status 'up'. The following is a
   descriptive example of step by step creation:

   Step 1 - Create the frame relay PVC endpoint

   a) Agent receives management request to create a row in
      frPVCEndptTable for the Frame Relay side

   b) System creates the row in frPVCEndptTable with the following
      defaults:

       - initialize frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier to zero

       - initialize frPVCIWFKind to 0.0

       - initialize the remaining columns as needed for DLCI X
         on ifIndex Y


   Step 2 - Create the ATM PVC endpoint

   a) Agent receives management request to create a row in atmVclTable
      for the ATM side

   b) System creates the row in atmVclTable with the following defaults:

       - initialize atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier to zero

       - initialize atmVclIWFKind to 0.0

       - initialize the remaining columns as needed for VPI.VCI
         Q.R on ifIndex S

Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


   Step 3 - Create the FR/ATM cross-connect

   a) Manager requests a new cross-connect index value by reading
      frAtmIwfConnectionIndexNext from the agent

   b) Agent receives GET request for frAtmIwfConnectionIndexNext
      and responds with the next available value K

   c) Manager requests a new cross-connect row entry using the value
      K as the index

   d) Agent receives SET request to create the frAtmIwfConnectionTable
      row entry (note: the frame relay and ATM PVC endpoints MUST exist
      and
      be specified as part of the index fields for the row 'K.S.Q.R.Y.X')

   e) System creates a row in frAtmIwfConnectionTable for the following
      indices:

       - frAtmIwfConnectionIndex of K

       - frAtmIwfConnAtmPort of S

       - frAtmIwfConnVpi of Q

       - frAtmIwfConnVci of R

       - frAtmIwfConnFrPort of Y

       - frAtmIwfConnDlci of X

   f) Manager defines the appropriate connection descriptor or
      uses one of the available entries in the connection descriptor
      table for the new connection.

   g) System establishes the appropriate connection descriptor for
      the IWF (specified by manager in the SET request of
      frAtmIwfcOnnectionDescriptor for the relevant row)


   Step 4 - Point the frame relay PVC endpoint row to the FR/ATM cross-
   connect row (Note: The system may perform these actions as a side-
   effect of Step 3)

   a) System sets frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier to K

Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


   b) System sets frPVCIWFKind to OID of frAtmIwfConnectionTable to
      point to the FR/ATM PVC IWF cross-connect table


   Step 5 - Point the ATM PVC endpoint row to the FR/ATM cross-connect
   row (Note: The system may perform these actions as a side-effect of
   Step 3)

   a) System sets atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier to K

   b) System sets atmVclIWFKind to frAtmIwfConnectionTable


   Step 6 - Manager signals activation by issuing a SET for the
   frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus object using the value of 'up'


   Step 7 - Agent receives SET request for frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus and
   executes internal system mechanisms to activate each PVC segment and
   the IWF cross-connect. The successful activation permits the agent to
   respond with 'active' when a GET request is received for the
   following fields:

       - frAtmIwfConnAtm2FrOperStatus

       - frAtmIwfConnFr2AtmOperStatus

       - atmVclOperStatus (Note: there is no comparable FRS MIB object)



2.5.2.  Destruction Process

   Destruction operation of a cross connect entry is simple in terms of
   NMS required operation. However, it carries additional implementation
   specific side effects of system clean up with respect to the removed
   cross connect.  The following are the steps that should be carried
   thereafter:


   Step 1 - Agent receives SET request for frAtmIwfConnRowStatus of the
   relevant entry to 'destroy' and executes internal system clean up
   mechanisms

Internet Draft      FR/ATM Service Interworking MIB            June 1999


   Step 2 - System removes the relevant cross connect pointer from the
   frame relay PVC endpoint

   a) System sets frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier to 0

   b) System sets frPVCIWFKind to 0.0


   Step 3 - System removes the relevant cross connect pointer from the
   ATM PVC endpoint

   a) System sets atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier to 0

   b) System sets atmVclIWFKind to 0.0


   Step 4 - system can sets atmVclOperStatus to 'down'(Note: there is no
   comparable FRS MIB object)

   The FR PVC end point, the ATM PVC endpoint and the
   frAtmIwfcOnnectionDescriptor entries can continue to exist after the
   cross connect removal.

2.5.3.  Failure Conditions

2.5.3.1.  Creation and Destruction

   The frame relay service MIB must contain an endpoint connection table
   entry for the frame relay side of the interworked connection before
   the interworked connection can be activated in this MIB.  The same is
   true for the ATM endpoint connection table.

   In addition, the connection descriptor table entry must exist before
   being referenced by the FR/ATM IWF connection table entry.

   If required table rows do not exist when the connection table is
   activated, the request will fail as described in the
   frAtmIwfConnRowStatus object.

   Destruction of objects must occur in the reverse order of creation.

2.5.3.2.  PDU Translation Errors

   When a PDU translation error occurs (e.g. an unknown protocol ID is
   encountered), the frAtmIwfTransErrCount object is incremented and
   information about the failure is stored in objects that report the
   effected connection, direction of travel, and initial octets in the
   PDU header.

3.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

                      is represented by a single row in the FR/ATM IWF
                      Connection Table.  The case of a single Frame
                      Relay PVC connected to multiple ATM PVCs (or
                      single ATM PVC connected to multiple Frame Relay
                      PVCs) is referred to as a `point-to-multipoint'
                      connection and is represented by multiple rows in
                      the FR/ATM IWF Connection Table.

                      The object frAtmIwfConnIndex uniquely identifies
                      each point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
                      connection.  The manager obtains the
                      frAtmIwfConnIndex value by reading the
                      frAtmIwfConnIndexNext object.

                      After a frAtmIwfConnIndex is assigned for the
                      connection, the manager creates one or more rows
                      in the Cross Connect Table; one for each cross-
                      connection between the frame relay PVC and an ATM
                      PVC. In the case of `point-to-multipoint'
                      connections, all rows are indexed by the same
                      frAtmIwfConnIndex value and MUST refer to the same
                      frame relay PVC or ATM PVC respectively.  An entry
                      can be created only when at least one pair of
                      Frame Relay and ATM PVCs exist.

                      A row can be established by one-step set-request
                      with all required parameter values and
                      frAtmIwfConnRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). The
                      Agent should perform all error checking as needed.
                      A pair of cross-connected PVCs, as identified by a
                      particular value of the indexes, is released by
                      setting frAtmIwfConnRowStatus to destroy(6). The
                      Agent may release all associated resources. The
                      manager may remove the related PVCs thereafter.
                      Indexes are persistent across reboots of the
                      system."

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
