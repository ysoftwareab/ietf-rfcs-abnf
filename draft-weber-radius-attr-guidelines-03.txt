Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol
   [RFC2865] [RFC2866] uses an attribute paradigm as the basis for
   representing authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) data.
   RADIUS messages exchanged between client and server contain lists of
   similarly formatted attributes.

   Unlike SNMP [RFC1157] [RFC1155], RADIUS does not use a formal data
   definition language to describe its attributes or attribute formats.
   A handful of basic data types are provided, and a data type is
   associated with a particular attribute when that attribute is
   defined.

   Two distinct attribute spaces are defined: the standard space, and a
   vendor specific space.  Attributes in the standard space generally
   are composed of a type, length, value (TLV) triplet.  The vendor
   specific space is encapsulated within a single attribute type
   (Vendor-Specific Attribute or VSA).  The format of this space is
   defined by individual vendors, but the same TLV encoding used by the
   standard space is recommended.

   The similarity between attribute formats has enabled implementations
   to leverage a common parsing functionality, though attributes in the
   vendor specific space have begun to diverge in some cases from use of
   the common formatting.  In addition, many new attributes in the
   vendor specific space are actually not intended to be vendor specific
   at all, such as those attributes defined by Standards Development
   Organizations (SDOs) outside the IETF, e.g. the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP).  Perhaps a contributing factor in the
   SDOs' decision to use the vendor specific space, is that the standard
   attribute space is limited to approximately 250 unique attributes; of
   these, only about half remain available for allocation.  In the
   vendor specific space, the number of attributes available is a
   function of the format of the attribute (the size of the type field).

   This document analyzes some of the issues around rationalizing the
   RADIUS attribute data model and recommends extending the model to
   allow more alignment between the standard and vendor attribute
   spaces.  The extension mechanism, defined in [EXTATTR], is in the
   form of a new RADIUS attribute which accommodates some of the



Weber                   Expires December 28, 2006               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


   features that have evolved over time in the vendor space including
   attribute grouping and an expanded attribute number space.

   This document also analyzes the usage of the basic data types defined
   in [RFC2865] and [RFC2866], together with the ad-hoc extensions to
   that data model that have been used in VSAs.  A proposal is included
   for additional base data types, as well as the formation of complex
   or structured data types, in a standard way.  This recommendation
   leads to a more regular, if not formal, data model for all RADIUS
   attributes.  These recommendations are made for both the traditional
   and the extended RADIUS attribute formats.

   Part of the intention of this work is to create a reference that may
   be used by future IETF RADIUS attribute designers and by other SDOs
   that work with RADIUS.  The guidelines presented here may also be
   used to facilitate the "Expert Review" process for reviewing RADIUS
   work described in [RFC3575].


3.  Motivation

   Since the closure of the IETF's RADIUS Working Group, the popularity
   and prevalence of RADIUS usage has continued to grow and is now
   commonly applied to various access media in addition to dial in
   access.  The large number of vendors and SDOs developing and
   providing RADIUS-based solutions has led to some technical
   splintering in the approach to RADIUS attribute design.

3.1.  Divergent Data Models

   In particular, the data model covering the standard RADIUS attributes
   is much more constrained than the data model for vendor space
   attributes.  Vendors have evolved the data model they use to support
   new functions like attribute grouping and attribute fragmentation.
   Multiple methods have been developed to achieve these desirable
   features.

   There is no motivation for vendors or SDOs to move generally useful
   attributes from the vendor space to the more stringent standard
   space, so the data models continue to diverge.

   One of RADIUS's design goals was that new attributes should be able
   to be added without modifying the client or server core protocol
   parsing code.  As attributes continue to take on new formats, this
   advantage will fade.  Many implementations of RADIUS servers use a
   data dictionary driven parser implementation.  Attribute formats that
   do not follow established conventions often break the ability to add
   new attributes to servers by adding their definitions to the data



Weber                   Expires December 28, 2006               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


   dictionary.

   In addition, more attribute-specific parsing means more complex
   software to develop and maintain, and more complexity may lead to
   more error prone implementations.

3.2.  Attribute Space Exhaustion

   Another impending problem is that eventually the standard attribute
   space may become depleted over time.  The type code field for
   standard attributes is one octet, so a maximum of 255 attributes may
   be defined; approximately half of which are currently unallocated.

3.3.  Diameter Alignment

   Section 9 of [RFC4005] describes RADIUS/Diameter interactions.  While
   Diameter [RFC3588] has much more functionality than RADIUS [RFC2865],
   it may facilitate interoperation to align the RADIUS and Diameter
   data models at least at some basic level.


4.  Current Data Model

   The following subsections describe how RADIUS data are typed and
   formatted according to the current specification set.  Some
   exceptions to the rules are identified.

4.1.  Data Types

   RADIUS attributes are typed by reference.  In other words, the data
   type of a particular attribute is fixed when that attribute is
   defined.  The data type information is not transported on the wire.
   The reference to the attribute type allows RADIUS entities to know
   the data type because typically, each RADIUS entity has access to a
   dictionary or some other mechanism describing all defined attributes.

   The RADIUS specifications define these data types:

   text      1-253 octets containing UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279]
             characters.  Text of length zero (0) MUST NOT be sent; omit
             the entire attribute instead.
   string    1-253 octets containing binary data (values 0 through 255
             decimal, inclusive).  Strings of length zero (0) MUST NOT
             be sent; omit the entire attribute instead.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


   address   32 bit value, most significant octet first.
   integer   32 bit unsigned value, most significant octet first.
   time      32 bit unsigned value, most significant octet first --
             seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.  The standard
             Attributes do not use this data type but it is presented
             here for possible use in future attributes

   The current specifications do not always adhere to specifying a data
   type from this set.

   For example, in the attribute definition for Framed-Interface-Id
   (from [RFC3162]), the data type is not given; the value is simply
   defined as an 8 octet value.

   Likewise in the definition of CHAP-Password (from [RFC2865]), the
   data type of the CHAP Identifier is not given, only the one octet
   length.

   As you can see, in some cases the data are described textually.  This
   is possible because the data types are not sent inside the
   attributes.  They are largely a matter for endpoint interpretation.
   In fact, an implementation could define additional data types, say
   for example, for IPv6 address, and use these data types today by
   matching them to the attribute's textual description.

   In fact, some RADIUS implementations treat tagged attributes (see
   section 4.3) as an additional data type.

4.2.  General Attribute Format

   The attribute TLV encoding is summarized in [RFC2865] as:

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   |     Type      |    Length     |  Value ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   However, some standard attributes do not follow this format.  The
   definition of CHAP-Password above demonstrates this inconsistency.
   Similarly, the ARAP-Password attribute definition (from [RFC2869]),
   instead of having a single Value field, contains four 4-octet values.

   In general, these types of multi-valued attributes may treat the
   concatenation of all the values as a String data type field.
   However, separating these values into different attributes, each with
   its own type and length, would enable additional error checking and
   would simplify implementations by eliminating special case, attribute

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


   specific parsing.

4.3.  Tagging Mechanism

   [RFC2868] defines an attribute grouping mechanism based on the use of
   a one octet tag value.  Tunnel attributes that refer to the same
   tunnel are grouped together by virtue of using the same tag value.

   This tagging mechanism has some drawbacks.  There are a limited
   number of unique tags (31).  The tags are not well suited for use
   with arbitrary binary data values because it is not always possible
   to tell if the first byte after the Length is the tag or the first
   byte of the untagged value (assuming the tag is optional).

   When integer values are tagged, the value portion is reduced to three
   bytes meaning only 24-bit numbers can be represented.

   The tagging mechanism does not offer an ability to create nested
   groups of attributes.

4.4.  Vendor-Specific Attribute Format

   [RFC2865] allows each vendor to define its own attribute space under
   the Vendor-Specific attribute.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |  Length       |            Vendor-Id
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Vendor-Id (cont)           |  String...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   The format of data in the String field of Vendor-Specific attributes
   is under each vendor's control, but the specification advises that
   this field SHOULD be encoded as show below.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Length       |            Vendor-Id
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Vendor-Id (cont)              | Vendor type   | Vendor length |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Attribute-Specific...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

      Multiple sub-attributes MAY be encoded within a single Vendor-

      Specific attribute, although they do not have to be.

   Allowing multiple sub-attributes does provide a form of grouping.

4.5.  Value Packing

   Some attributes pack multiple data items into a single attribute
   value field.  For example, the Connect-Info attribute defined in
   [RFC2869] may contain values like "28800 V42BIS/LAPM" or "52000/31200
   V90".

   Encoding multiple values within a Text attribute reduces the amount
   of data validation that can be performed when the attribute is first
   encountered.  This particular attribute is used in Access-Request
   messages.  If authorization decisions are based on connection speed
   information, it would perhaps be better to validate it separately
   from the remainder of the Text attribute.


5.  Data Model Features in the Vendor Space

   Vendors, of course, are under no obligation to publish their
   proprietary usages of RADIUS.  Through SDOs, however, we can see some
   of the RADIUS usages that have developed in the vendor space.

5.1.  Grouping

   Various strategies and justifications for organizing attribute data
   into groups have proven popular.  The most common of these is
   probably the sub-attribute scheme introduced in the Vendor-Specific
   format recommendation.  Another method is to concatenate multiple
   values into a single String or Text attribute.

   Here are some of the reasons given for grouping attributes:

   o  Compactness - As with bit flags or multiply valued attributes,
      e.g. a list of IP addresses.
   o  Logical Relationship - For attributes which describe multiple
      aspects of a single entity or which have interdependencies.
   o  Shared Information - As with a group of attributes related to a
      single timestamp or remote IP address.

5.2.  Attribute Encryption

   Some legal environments restrict particular types of data from being
   transmitted in clear text.  Some vendors have developed means of
   encrypting particular RADIUS attributes within messages for use in
   deployments where the operators want to avoid various deployment



Weber                   Expires December 28, 2006               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


   issues related to IPsec [RFC4301].

5.3.  Fragmentation

   Several different methods are in use to handle attributes which
   exceed the 253 octet length limit.  One vendor has specified use of
   multiple attributes with an embedded sequence number to transfer MS-
   CHAP-LM-Enc-PW (as described in [RFC2548]).  One SDO uses multiple
   attributes, requiring them to be consecutive but without embedded
   sequence info (see Section 13.1.5.2 in [PKT-SP-EM1.5]) to transfer
   several large attributes.


6.  Scope and Solution Characteristics

   These subsections describe the desirable scope of any recommended
   changes to make the RADIUS data model more uniform.

6.1.  Backwards Compatibility

   It is imperative that any changes to the data model do not impact
   functioning deployments.

6.1.1.  Intermediate Nodes

   RADIUS deployments can include complex proxy architectures.
   Intermediate nodes may be under separate administrative or
   operational control from the endpoint client and server.  In these
   scenarios it would not be likely that intermediate nodes would make
   software or configuration changes to support new functionality at the
   endpoints.

   Any data model changes should be transparent to intermediate nodes.
   This means no changes in wire formats outside the value portion of
   attributes.

6.1.2.  Dictionary-based Implementations

   Support for structured data or attribute groupings would likely
   impact dictionary-based implementations.  Typically, such an
   implementation would use the attribute type as an index into a single
   description of the attribute.

   There is some precedent for requiring software changes to deploy new
   RADIUS functionality.  This happened with the addition of tagged
   attribute support and the dynamic authorization extensions [RFC3576].

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


6.1.3.  Unaware Endpoints

   Any changes must recognize the fact that any combination of client or
   server might not understand the new functionality.  That said, this
   document will not address the idea of capability negotiation or
   advertisement.  This would seem to be a problem common to other
   features and should be addressed separately.

6.2.  Existing Vendor-Specific Attribute Usage

   No new, retroactive requirements should be placed on vendors with
   regard to existing use of Vendor-Specific attributes.  However,
   recommendations may be made for SDOs specifying attributes intended
   for use by multiple vendors.

6.3.  Transport Impact

   No changes will be made to the RADIUS transport or (related) maximum
   packet sizes.

6.4.  Non-AAA Applications

   This document is not targeted at non-AAA applications which use
   RADIUS as a transport such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) [RFC3748] [RFC3579].  These applications do not need to conform
   to the RADIUS data model as the RADIUS client and server are not the
   real endpoints of such conversations.  For AAA applications, however,
   the RADIUS data model should not be circumvented; RADIUS is not
   intended as a generalized "carrier protocol".

6.5.  Diameter Compatibility

   Changes to the RADIUS data model should be Diameter-friendly.  It is
   not the intent to reproduce all or even significant Diameter
   functionality, or to support all Diameter applications via RADIUS.
   Ensuring that the data models are somewhat aligned, however, will
   facilitate the work of Translation Agents for common applications
   (see section 2.8.4 of [RFC3588]).

6.6.  Security

   This document does not define any new security mechanisms to protect
   RADIUS attribute content, though there may be future IETF work in
   this area.  See Section 10 for further information.


7.  Guidelines

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attribute Guidelines             June 2006


   These guidelines apply to all future RADIUS work, including both
   traditional standard space attributes and attributes which make use
   of the extension mechanism specified in [EXTATTR].

7.1.  Deviation from Standard Practice

   In general, new attributes SHOULD comply with the attribute design
   guidelines given in [RFC2865] unless one or more of the following
   applies:
   o  The standard attribute space for new attributes has been
      exhausted.
   o  The proposed maximum attribute length exceeds that available for
      attributes specified by [RFC2865].
   o  The native data type of the data element is defined by [EXTATTR]
      but not [RFC2865].
   o  Structured data must be explicitly represented (as discussed in
      Section 7.2).

7.2.  Structured Data

   As mentioned in Section 5.1, logically grouping data within RADIUS
   messages has been a popular feature within the individual vendor
   attribute spaces.  The guidance for when to use which mechanism to
   affect the logical grouping of data depends on the intended consumer
   of the attribute values.

   Intended consumers of RADIUS attributes include:
   1.  Humans: consume attributes intended to aid in troubleshooting and
       operational problem determination.
   2.  Billing: accounting data are typically consumed by a business
       mediation layer in preparation for billing systems.
   3.  Non-RADIUS authorization applications: these entities include
       policy servers, EAP servers, and other consumers of data which
       are typically opaque to RADIUS servers and proxies.
   4.  RADIUS servers and proxies: parse and operate on individual
       elements within RADIUS messages.

   Attributes designed to be consumed or parsed by RADIUS servers and
   proxies SHOULD explicitly represent their structured data using the
   extension mechanism specified in [EXTATTR].  Attributes designed to
   be consumed by the other entities above may use the existing
   mechanisms to group or structure data such as overloading String
   values.

7.3.  Additional Guidance

   In the cases from Section 7.1, it is RECOMMENDED that the extended
   attribute encoding specified by [EXTATTR] be used.

   Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED that:

   1.  The Vendor-Specific Enumeration (VSE) encoding mechanism as
       proposed by Section 2.2.1 of [RFC2882] SHOULD NOT be used.
       Instead, vendors should comply with the recommendations of
       [RFC3575]
   2.  The message lengths specified by RADIUS standards MUST NOT be
       exceeded.
   3.  Variable attribute content SHOULD NOT be specified.  Separate
       attributes SHOULD be defined instead.
   4.  SDOs are RECOMMENDED to design attributes using the guidelines in
       this document 'as if' they were destined for the standard
       attribute space, but of course, may continue to implement new
       attributes in their own attributes spaces.


8.  Diameter Considerations

   This document defines guidelines for RADIUS attribute design, but
   does not specify any new attributes.  As such, there are no Diameter
   considerations other than those already specified by section 9 of
   [RFC4005].

   See section 3 of [EXTATTR] for the Diameter considerations related to
   using the extended RADIUS attribute space.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not allocate any new values from IANA registries.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify any new functionality.  The security
   considerations related to using RADIUS are discussed in [RFC2865] and
   section 4.2 of [RFC3579].

   The security recommendations in [RFC3579] are based on usage of IPsec
   [RFC4301].  In some common implementations of IPsec for particular
   operating systems, applications and higher layer protocols do not
   have the ability to determine if the underlying security support is
   in place and functioning correctly.  For RADIUS, this may result in
   an inability for RADIUS clients and servers to determine whether the
   security recommendations in [RFC3579] are being met.

   As mentioned in Section 5.2, encrypting RADIUS data on a per-
   attribute basis is desirable for some deployments.  The current

   standard mechanism for doing this is described in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC2865] (for obscuring User-Password values) and is based on the
   MD5 algorithm specified in [RFC1321].  The MD5 algorithm has recently
   become a focus of scrutiny and concern in security circles.  Future
   IETF work will likely include the ability for RADIUS to support
   alternative algorithms.  When or if stronger algorithms are supported
   by RADIUS in the future, that work should be leveraged to provide
   stronger support for per-attribute encryption as well.
