              EVPN multi-homing port-active load-balancing
                     draft-ietf-bess-evpn-mh-pa-04

Abstract

   The Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) technology enables
   establishing a logical link-aggregation connection with a redundant
   group of independent nodes.  The purpose of multi-chassis LAG is to
   provide a solution to achieve higher network availability, while
   providing different modes of sharing/balancing of traffic.  RFC7432
   defines EVPN based MC-LAG with single-active and all-active
   multi-homing load-balancing mode.  The current draft expands on
   existing redundancy mechanisms supported by EVPN and introduces
   support for a new port-active load-balancing mode.

1.  Introduction

   EVPN, as per [RFC7432], provides all-active per flow load-balancing
   for multi-homing.  It also defines single-active with service carving
   mode, where one of the PEs, in redundancy relationship, is active per
   service.

   While these two multi-homing scenarios are most widely utilized in
   data center and service provider access networks, there are scenarios
   where active-standby per interface multi-homing load-balancing is

   useful and required.  The main consideration for this mode of
   load-balancing is the determinism of traffic forwarding through a
   specific interface rather than statistical per flow load-balancing
   across multiple PEs providing multi-homing.  The determinism provided
   by active-standby per interface is also required for certain QOS
   features to work.  While using this mode, customers also expect
   minimized convergence during failures.

   A new type of load-balancing mode, port-active load-balancing, is
   defined.  This draft describes how the new load-balancing mode can be
   supported via EVPN.  The new mode may also be referred to as per
   interface active/standby.

                         Figure 1: MC-LAG Topology

   Figure 1 shows a MC-LAG multi-homing topology where PE1 and PE2 are
   part of the same redundancy group providing multi-homing to CE1 via
   interfaces I1 and I2.  Interfaces I1 and I2 are members of a LAG
   running LACP protocol.  The core, shown as IP or MPLS enabled,
   provides wide range of L2 and L3 services.  MC-LAG multi-homing
   functionality is decoupled from those services in the core and it
   focuses on providing multi-homing to the CE.  With per-port active/
   standby load-balancing, only one of the two interface I1 or I2 would
   be in forwarding, the other interface will be in standby.  This also
   implies that all services on the active interface are in active mode
   and all services on the standby interface operate in standby mode.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation

   When a CE is multi-homed to a set of PE nodes using the [802.1AX]
   Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), the PEs must act as if they
   were a single LACP speaker for the Ethernet links to form and operate
   as a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  To achieve this, the PEs
   connected to the same multi-homed CE must synchronize LACP
   configuration and operational data among them.  Interchassis
   Communication Protocol (ICCP) [RFC7275] has been used for that
   purpose.  EVPN LAG simplifies greatly that solution.  Along with the
   simplification comes few assumptions:

   *  CE device connected to multi-homing PEs may have a single LAG with
      all its active links i.e. links in the LAG operate in all-active
      load-balancing mode.

   *  Same LACP parameters MUST be configured on peering PEs such as
      system id, port priority and port key.

   Any discrepancies from this list are left for future study.
   Furthermore, mis-configuration and mis-wiring detection across
   peering PEs are also left for further study.

3.  Port-active Load-balancing Procedure

   Following steps describe the proposed procedure with EVPN LAG to
   support port-active load-balancing mode:

   a.  The Ethernet-Segment Identifier (ESI) MUST be assigned per access
       interface as described in [RFC7432], which may be auto derived or
       manually assigned.  Access interface MAY be a Layer-2 or Layer-3
       interface.  The usage of ESI over Layer-3 interfce is newly
       described in this document.

   b.  Ethernet-Segment (ES) MUST be configured in port-active
       load-balancing mode on peering PEs for specific access interface.

   c.  Peering PEs MAY exchange only Ethernet-Segment (ES) route
       (Route Type-4) when ESI is configured on a Layer-3 interface.

Internet-Draft             EVPN MH Port-Active             November 2021


   d.  PEs in the redundancy group leverage the DF election defined in
       [RFC8584] to determine which PE keeps the port in active mode and
       which one(s) keep it in standby mode.  While the DF election
       defined in [RFC8584] is per [ES, Ethernet Tag] granularity, for
       port-active mode of multi-homing, the DF election is done per
       [ES].  The details of this algorithm are described in Section 4.

   e.  DF router MUST keep corresponding access interface in up and
       forwarding active state for that Ethernet-Segment

   f.  Non-DF routers MAY bring and keep peering access interface
       attached to it in operational down state.  If the interface is
       running LACP protocol, then the non-DF PE MAY also set the LACP
       state to OOS (Out of Sync) as opposed to interface state down.
       This allows for better convergence on standby to active
       transition.

   g.  For EVPN-VPWS service, the usage of primary/backup bits of EVPN
       Layer-2 attributes extended community [RFC8214] is highly
       recommended to achieve better convergence.

4.  Designated Forwarder Algorithm to Elect per Port-active PE

   The ES routes, running in port-active load-balancing mode, are
   advertised with a new capability in the DF Election Extended
   Community as defined in [RFC8584].  Moreover, the ES associated to
   the port leverages existing procedure of single-active, and signals
   single-active bit along with Ethernet-AD per-ES route.  Finally, as
   in [RFC7432], the ESI-label based split-horizon procedures should be
   used to avoid transient echo'ed packets when Layer-2 circuits are
   involved.

   The various algorithms for DF Election are discussed in Sections 4.2
   to 4.4 for completeness, although the choice of algorithm in this
   solution doesn't affect complexity or performance as in other load-
   balancing modes.

4.1.  Capability Flag

   [RFC8584] defines a DF Election extended community, and a Bitmap
   field to encode "capabilities" to use with the DF election algorithm
   in the DF algorithm field.  Bitmap (2 octets) is extended by the
   following value:

    Figure 2: Amended Bitmap field in the DF Election Extended Community

      Bit 0: D bit or 'Don't Preempt' bit', as explained in
      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-pref-df].

      Bit 1: AC-DF Capability (AC-Influenced DF election), as explained
      in [RFC8584].

      Bit 5: (corresponds to Bit 29 of the DF Election Extended
      Community and it is defined by this document): P bit or
      'Port Mode' bit (P hereafter), determines that the DF-Algorithm
      should be modified to consider the port only and not the Ethernet
      Tags.

4.2.  Modulo-based Algorithm

   The default DF Election algorithm, or modulus-based algorithm as in
   [RFC7432] and updated by [RFC8584], is used here, at the granularity
   of ES only.  Given the fact, ES-Import RT community inherits from ESI
   only byte 1-6, many deployments differentiate ESI within these bytes
   only.  For Modulo calculation, bytes 3-6 are used to determine the
   designated forwarder using Modulo-based DF assignment.

4.3.  HRW Algorithm

   Highest Random Weight (HRW) algorithm defined in [RFC8584] MAY also
   be used and signaled, and modified to operate at the granularity of
   [ES] rather than per [ES, VLAN].

   [RFC8584] describes computing a 32 bit CRC over the concatenation of
   Ethernet Tag and ESI.  For port-active load-balancing mode, the
   Ethernet Tag is simply removed from the CRC computation.

4.4.  Preference-based DF Election

   When the new capability 'Port-Mode' is signaled, the algorithm is
   modified to consider the port only and not any associated Ethernet
   Tags.  Furthermore, the "port-based" capability MUST be compatible
   with the "Don't Preempt" bit.  When an interface recovers, a peering
   PE signaling D-bit will enable non-revertive behaviour at the port
   level.  The AC-DF bit MUST be set to zero.  When an AC (sub-
   interface) goes down, it does not influence the DF election.

5.  Convergence considerations

   To improve the convergence, upon failure and recovery, when
   port-active load-balancing mode is used, some advanced
   synchronization between peering PEs may be required.  Port-active is
   challenging in a sense that the "standby" port is in down state.  It
   takes some time to bring a "standby" port in up-state and settle the
   network.  For IRB and L3 services, ARP / ND cache may be
   synchronized.  Moreover, associated VRF tables may also be
   synchronized.  For L2 services, MAC table synchronization may be
   considered.

   Finally, for members of a LAG running LACP the ability to set the
   "standby" port in "out-of-sync" state a.k.a "warm-standby" can be
   leveraged.

5.1.  Primary / Backup per Ethernet-Segment

   The L2 Info Extended Community MAY be advertised in Ethernet A-D
   per ES route for fast convergence.  Only the P and B bits are
   relevant to this specification.  When advertised, the L2 Info
   Extended Community SHALL have only P or B bits set and all other bits
   must be zero.  MTU must also be zero.  Remote PE receiving optional
   L2 Info Extended Community on Ethernet A-D per ES routes SHALL
   consider only P and B bits.  P and B bits received on Ethernet A-D
   per EVI routes per [RFC8214] are overridden.

5.2.  Backward Compatibility

   Implementations that comply with [RFC7432] or [RFC8214] only (i.e.,
   implementations that predate this specification) will not advertise
   the L2 Info Extended Community in Ethernet A-D per ES routes.  That
   means that all remote PEs in the ES will not receive P and B bit per
   ES and will continue to receive and honour the P and B bits received
   in Ethernet A-D per EVI route(s).  Similarly, an implementation that
   complies with [RFC7432] or [RFC8214] only and that receives a L2 Info
   Extended Community will ignore it and will continue to use the
   default path resolution algorithm.

6.  Applicability

   A common deployment is to provide L2 or L3 service on the PEs
   providing multi-homing.  The services could be any L2 EVPN such as
   EVPN VPWS, EVPN [RFC7432], etc.  L3 service could be in VPN context
   [RFC4364] or in global routing context.  When a PE provides first hop
   routing, EVPN IRB could also be deployed on the PEs.  The mechanism
   defined in this draft is used between the PEs providing the L2 and/or
   L3 service, when the requirement is to use per port active.

   A possible alternate solution is the one described in this draft is
   MC-LAG with ICCP [RFC7275] active-standby redundancy.  However, ICCP
   requires LDP to be enabled as a transport of ICCP messages.  There
   are many scenarios where LDP is not required e.g. deployments with
   VXLAN or SRv6.  The solution defined in this draft with EVPN does not
   mandate the need to use LDP or ICCP and is independent of the
   underlay encapsulation.

7.  Overall Advantages

   The use of port-active multi-homing brings the following benefits to
   EVPN networks:

   a.  Open standards based per interface single-active load-balancing
       mechanism that eliminates the need to run ICCP and LDP.

   b.  Agnostic of underlay technology (MPLS, VXLAN, SRv6) and
       associated services (L2, L3, Bridging, E-LINE, etc).

   c.  Provides a way to enable deterministic QOS over MC-LAG attachment
       circuits.

   d.  Fully compliant with [RFC7432], does not require any new protocol
       enhancement to existing EVPN RFCs.

   e.  Can leverage various DF election algorithms e.g. modulo, HRW,
       etc.

   f.  Replaces legacy MC-LAG ICCP-based solution, and offers following
       additional benefits:

       *  Efficiently supports 1+N redundancy mode (with EVPN using BGP
          RR) where as ICCP requires full mesh of LDP sessions among PEs
          in redundancy group.

       *  Fast convergence with mass-withdraw is possible with EVPN, no
          equivalent in ICCP.

   g.  Customers want per interface single-active load-balancing, but
       don't want to enable LDP (e.g. they may be running VXLAN or SRv6
       in the network).  Currently there is no alternative to this.

   *  Bit 5 in the [RFC8584] DF Election Capabilities registry, with
      name "P" (port mode load-balancing) Capability" for port-active
      ES.
