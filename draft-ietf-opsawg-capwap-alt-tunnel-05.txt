        Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data Frames in CAPWAP
                 draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel-05

Abstract

   Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) defines a
   specification to encapsulate a station's data frames between the
   Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).
   Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either
   locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP data
   channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments encapsulating
   data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example to an Access
   Router (AR)) is desirable.  Further, it may also be desirable to use
   different tunnel encapsulations to carry the stations' data frames.
   This document provides a specification for this and refers to it as
   Alternate tunnel encapsulation.  The Alternate tunnel encapsulation
   allows 1) the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint
   different from the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many
   known encapsulation types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may
   advertise support for Alternate tunnel encapsulation during the
   discovery or join process and AC may select one of the supported
   Alternate Tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.

Internet-Draft              Alternate Tunnel                  April 2015


1.  Introduction

   Service Providers are deploying very large Wi-Fi deployments (ranging
   from hundreds of thousands of Access Points, APs (referred to as WTPs
   in CAPWAP terminology) to millions of APs.  These networks are
   designed to carry traffic generated from mobile users.  The volume in
   mobile user traffic is already very large and expected to continue
   growing rapidly.  As a result, operators are looking for scalable
   solutions that can meet the increasing demand.  The scalability
   requirement can be met by splitting the control/management plane from
   the data plane.  This enables the data plane to scale independent of
   the control/management plane.  This specification provides a way to
   enable such separation.

   CAPWAP ([RFC5415], [RFC5416]) defines a tunnel mode that describes
   how the WTP handles the data plane (user traffic).  The following
   types are defined:

   o  Local Bridging: All data frames are locally bridged.
   o  802.3 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.3
      format.
   o  802.11 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.11
      format.

   Figure 1 describes a system with Local Bridging.  The AC is in a
   centralized location.  The data plane is locally bridged by the WTPs
   leading to a system with centralized control plane with distributed
   data plane.  This system has two benefits: 1) reduces the scale
   requirement on data traffic handling capability of the AC and 2)
   leads to more efficient/optimal routing of data traffic while
   maintaining centralized control/management.

            Figure 1: Centralized Control with Distributed Data

   The AC handles control of WTPs.  In addition, the AC also handles the
   IEEE 802.11 management traffic to/ from the stations.  There is
   CAPWAP Control and Data Channel between the WTP and the AC.  Note
   that even though there is no user traffic transported between the WTP
   and AC, there is still a CAPWAP Data Channel.  The CAPWAP Data
   channel carries the IEEE 802.11 management traffic (like IEEE 802.11
   Action Frames).

   Figure 2 shows a system where the tunnel mode is configured to tunnel
   data frames between the WTP and the AC either using 802.3 Tunnel or
   802.11 Tunnel configurations.  Operators deploy this configuration
   when they need to tunnel the user traffic.  The tunneling requirement
   may be driven by the need to apply policy at the Access Router or a
   legal requirement to support lawful intercept of user traffic.  This
   requirement could be met in the locally bridged system (Figure 1) if
   the access router implemented the required policy.  However, in many
   deployments the operator managing the WTP is different than the
   operator managing the Access Router.  When the operators are
   different, the policy has to be enforced in a tunnel termination
   point in the WTP operator's network.

            Figure 2: Centralized Control and Centralized Data

   The key difference with the locally bridged system is that the data
   frames are tunneled to the AC instead of being locally bridged.
   There are two shortcomings with system in Figure 2.  1) They do not
   allow the WTP to tunnel data frames to an endpoint different from the
   AC and 2) They do not allow the WTP to tunnel data frames using any
   encapsulation other than CAPWAP (as specified in Section 4.4.2 of
   [RFC5415]).

   Figure 3 shows a system where the WTP tunnels data frames to an
   alternate entity different from the AC.  The WTP also uses an
   alternate tunnel encapsulation such as such as L2TP, L2TPv3, IP-in-
   IP, IP/GRE, etc.  This enables 1) independent scaling of data plane
   and 2) leveraging of commonly used tunnel encapsulations such as
   L2TP, GRE, etc

       Figure 3: Centralized Control with Alternate Tunnel for Data

   The WTP may support widely used encapsulation types such as L2TP,
   L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IP/GRE, etc.  The WTP advertises the different
   alternate tunnel encapsulation types it can support.  The AC
   configures one of the advertised types.  As shown in the figure there
   is a CAPWAP control and data channel between the WTP and AC.  The
   CAPWAP data channel carries the stations' management traffic as in
   the case of the locally bridged system.  The main reason to maintain
   a CAPWAP data channel is to maintain similarity with the locally
   bridged system.  The WTP maintains three tunnels: CAPWAP Control,
   CAPWAP Data, and another alternate tunnel for the data frame.  The
   data frames are transported by an alternate tunnel between the WTP
   and a tunnel termination point such as an Access Router.  This
   specification describes how the alternate tunnel can be established.
   The specification defines message elements for the WTP to advertise
   support for alternate tunnel encapsulation, the AC to configure
   alternate tunnel encapsulation, and for the WTP to report failure of
   the alternate tunnel.

   The above example describes how the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   may be established.  When the WTP joins the AC, it should indicate
   its alternate tunnel encapsulation capability.  The AC determines
   whether an alternate tunnel configuration is required.  If an
   appropriate alternate tunnel type is selected, then the AC provides
   the alternate tunnel encapsulation message element containing the
   tunnel type and a tunnel-specific information element.  (The tunnel-
   specific information element, for example, may contain information
   like the IP address of the tunnel termination point.)  The WTP sets
   up the alternate tunnel using the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   message element.

   On detecting a tunnel failure, WTP shall forward data frames to the
   AC and discard the frames.  In addition, WTP may dissociate existing
   clients and refuse association requests from new clients.  Depending
   on the implementation and deployment scenario, the AC may choose to
   reconfigure the WLAN (on the WTP) to a local bridging mode or to
   tunnel frames to the AC.  When the WTP detects an alternate tunnel
   failure, the WTP informs the AC using a message element, WTP
   Alternate Tunnel Fail Indication (defined in this specification).
   The message element has a status field that indicates whether the
   message denotes reporting a failure or the clearing of the previously
   reported failure.

   For the case where AC is unreachable but the tunnel end point is
   still reachable, the WTP behavior is up to the implementation.  For
   example, the WTP could either choose to tear down the alternate
   tunnel or let the existing user's traffic continue to be tunneled.

   The Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element is sent by
   the WTP to inform the AC about the status of the Alternate Tunnel.
   The message element contains the following fields

      Radio ID: The Radio Identifier, whose value is between one (1) and
      31, typically refers to some interface index on the WTP.
      WLAN ID: An 8-bit value specifying the WLAN Identifier.  The value
      MUST be between one (1) and 16.
      Status: An 8-bit boolean indicating whether the radio failure is
      being reported or cleared.  A value of zero is used to clear the
      event, while a value of one is used to report the event.

3.4.  CAPWAP based Alternate Tunnel

   If the CAPWAP encapsulation is selected by the AC and configured by
   the AC to the WTP, the Info Element field defined in Section 3.2
   should contain the following information:

   o  Access Router Information: IPv4 address or IPv6 address or Fully
      Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), of the Access Router for the
      alternate tunnel.
   o  Tunnel DTLS Policy: The CAPWAP protocol allows optional protection
      of data packets using DTLS.  Use of data packet protection on a
      WTP is not mandatory but determined by the associated AC policy
      (This is consistent with the WTP behavior described in [RFC5415]).
   o  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy: It is used to specify how the
      CAPWAP data channel packet are to be tagged for QoS purposes (see
      [RFC5416] for more details).

   o  CAPWAP Transport Protocol: The CAPWAP protocol supports both UDP
      and UDP-Lite (see RFC3828).  When run over IPv4, UDP is used for
      the CAPWAP data channels.  When run over IPv6, the CAPWAP data
      channel may use either UDP or UDP-lite.

   The message element structure for CAPWAP encapsulation is shown in
   Figure 8:

3.5.  PMIPv6 based Alternate Tunnel

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) (defined in [RFC5213]) can also be used
   for alternate tunnel encapsulation between the WTP and the AR.  In
   this scenario, a WTP acts as the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) function
   that manages the mobility-related signaling for a station that is
   attached to the WTP IEEE 802.11 radio access.  The Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) function is at the AR.  If PMIPv6 encapsulation is
   selected by the AC and configured by the AC to a WTP, the Info
   Element field defined in Section 3.2 should contain the following
   information:

   o  Access Router (acts as LMA) Information: IPv6 address or Fully
      Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the alternate tunnel endpoint.

   The message element structure for PMIPv6 encapsulation is shown in
   Figure 9:

3.6.  Alternate Tunnel Information Elements

   This section defines the various sub-elements described in
   Section 3.4 and Section 3.5

3.6.1.  Access Router Information Sub-Elements

   The Access Router Information Sub-Elements allow the AC to notify a
   WTP of which AR(s) are available for establishing a data tunnel.  The
   AR information may be IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or AR domain name.
   If a WTP obtains the correct AR FQDN, the Name-to-IP address mapping
   is handled in the WTP (see RFC2782).

   The following are the Access Router Information Sub-Elements defined
   in this specification.  The AC can use one of them to notify the
   destination information of the data tunnel to the WTP.  The Sub-
   Elements containing the AR IPv4 address MUST NOT be used if an IPv6
   data channel such as PMIPv6 or GREv6 is used.

3.6.1.1.  AR IPv4 List Sub-Element

   This Sub-Element (see Figure 10) is used by the AC to configure a WTP
   with the AR IPv4 address available for the WTP to establish the data
   tunnel for user traffic.

3.6.1.3.  AR FQDN List Sub-Element

   This Sub-Element (see Figure 12) is used by the AC to configure a WTP
   with AR FQDN available to establish the data tunnel for user traffic.

3.6.2.  Tunnel DTLS Policy Sub-Element

   The AC distributes its DTLS usage policy for the CAPWAP data tunnel
   between a WTP and the AR.  There are multiple supported options,
   represented by the bit field below as defined in AC Descriptor
   message elements.  The WTP MUST abide by one of the options for
   tunneling user traffic with AR.  The Tunnel DTLS Policy Sub-Element
   obey the definition in [RFC5415].  If there are more than one ARs
   information provided by the AC for reliability reasons, the same
   Tunnel DTLS Policy (see Figure 13) is generally applied for all
   tunnels associated with the ARs.  Otherwise, Tunnel DTLS Policy MUST
   be bonding together with each of the ARs, then WTP will enforce the
   independent tunnel DTLS policy for each tunnel with a specific AR.

3.6.3.  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy Sub-Element

   In 802.11 networks, IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy Sub-Element is
   used to specify how the WTP apply the QoS tagging policy when
   receiving the packets from stations on a particular radio.  When the
   WTP sends out the packet to data channel to the AR(s), the packets
   have to be tagged for QoS purposes (see [RFC5416]).

   channel.

3.6.5.  GRE Key Sub-Element

   If a WTP receives the GRE Key Sub-Element in the Alternate Tunnel
   Encapsulation message element for GREv4 or GREv6 selection, the WTP
   must insert the GRE Key to the encapsulation packet (see [RFC2890]).
   An AR acting as decapsulating tunnel endpoint identifies packets
   belonging to a traffic flow based on the Key value.

   The GRE Key Sub-Element field contains a four octet number defined in
   [RFC2890].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA considerations.

   o  <IANA-1>.  This specification defines the Supported Alternate
      Tunnel Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.1.  This
      elements needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message
      Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for
      this element needs to be between 1 and 1023 (see Section 15.7 in
      [RFC5415]).
   o  <IANA-2>.  This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.2.  This element
      needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message Element Type
      registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for this element
      needs to be between 1 and 1023.
   o  <IANA-3>.  This specification defines the IEEE 802.11 WTP
      Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element in
      Section 3.3.  This element needs to be registered in the existing
      CAPWAP Message Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The
      Type value for this element needs to be between 1024 and 2047.
   o  Tunnel-Type: This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element.  This element contains a
      field Tunnel-Type.  The namespace for the field is 16 bits
      (0-65535)).  This specification defines values, zero (0) through
      six (6) and can be found in Section 3.2.  Future allocations of
      values in this name space are to be assigned by IANA using the
      "Specification Required" policy.  IANA needs to create a registry
      called CAPWAP Alternate Tunnel-Types.  The registry format is
      given below.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces three new CAPWAP WTP message elements.
   These elements are transported within CAPWAP Control messages as the
   existing message elements.  Therefore, this document does not
   introduce any new security risks compared to [RFC5415] and [RFC5416].
   In CAPWAP, security for CAPWAP Data Channel is optional and security
   policy is determined by AC.  Similarly, the AC determines the
   security for the Alternate Tunnel between WTP and Alternate Tunnel
   Encapsulation Gateway.  The security considerations described in
   [RFC5415] and [RFC5416] apply here as well.
