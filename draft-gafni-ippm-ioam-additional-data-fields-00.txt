           Additional data fields for IOAM Trace Option Types
            draft-gafni-ippm-ioam-additional-data-fields-00

Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
   discusses additional data fields and associated data types to be
   added to the IOAM data fileds described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].
   In-situ OAM data fields can be encapsulated into a variety of
   protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, IPv6 (via extension
   header), or IPv4.

1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document is
   adding additional data fields that can be reported by the network as
   part of IOAM.

3.  Additional Data Fields

   This draft extends [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] with additional data
   fields.  The additional suggested data fields are:

   o  Transmitted Bytes from an interface

   o  Speed of an interface

   o  Interface errors

   The addition of these new data fields is intended to help network
   operators to better manage their networks, where more data is
   requried with regards to the activity and quality of the network
   ports.  For example, one framework that may take advantage of these
   new data fileds is HPCC, which is proposed at
   [I-D.pan-tsvwg-hpccplus].  This section discusses the needed
   ammendments to the IOAM Trace header and the format of the added data
   fields themselves.

3.1.  IOAM Trace Option-Types Ammendments

   IOAM Trace Option-Types and their headers are defined in section 4.4
   of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  As shown in section 4.4.1, the trace
   option header includes an IOAM-Trace-Type which is a "A 24-bit
   identifier which specifies which data types are used in this node
   data list".  In order to extend [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] it is
   required to allocate respective bits specifying the additional data
   fields to be added to the packet.  This draft is asking for the
   allocation of additional 2 bits:

   Bit 12  When set indicates presence of Transmitted Bytes from an
      interface.

   Bit 13  When set indicates presence of Speed of an interface and
      Interface errors.

   Section 3.2 describes the new suggested data types and their formats.

3.2.  The Additional IOAM Node Data Fields and Associated Formats

   The Data fields and associated data types for each of the additional
   IOAM Data Fields are shown below:

   Transmitted Bytes from an interface:  4-octet field defined as
      follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           tx_bytes                            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      tx_bytes:  4-octet unsigned integer field.  This field indicates
         how many bytes have been transmitted from the egress interface
         the packet is going out from.  Note that this field may wrap
         around.  As an example, for a 100Gbps port this field may wrap
         around within less than 3 seconds.  This field is usable to
         determine the amount of data going through the path a flow is
         going through.  Following multiple packets traversing the same
         interface, together with a timestamp, allows a network operator
         to gauge the amount of traffic going through the interface in
         total and relative to the flow it tracks.  This data in turn
         may help to better control the traffic and take decisions
         related to the performance of the flow and the network.

   Speed of an interface and Total errors of an interface:  4-octet
      field defined as follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | interface_|                      interface_errors             |
   |   speed   |                                                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      interface_speed:  6 bits unsigned integer field.  This field
         indicates the current operational speed of the interface.  The
         procedure to allocate, manage and map the interface_speed
         values into the actual speed is beyond the scope of this
         document.  This field is usable to detect whether a packet or a
         flow is going through a path which has enough capacity compared
         to the expectation of the operator.  Changes in the speed of
         the connectivty may require changing routing decisions or
         troubleshooting the links under consideration.  When an
         operator intends to take a decision about the amount of data to
         transmit per flow, this data is helpful as well to track.

      interface_errors:  26 bits unsigned integer field.  This field
         inciates how many errors, such as packet drops due to CRC
         errors, have been detected on the interface used to deliver the
         packet.  This data is helpful in order to understand the risk
         associated with the packet, or the flow it belongs to, as it
         shows the quality of the interfaces it uses as part of its path
         in the network.  It can also point out potential issues that
         other packets from the same flow might have experienced.
