      OSPF Prefix/Link Attributes Extension Implementation Report
              draft-acee-ospf-prefix-link-attr-impl-01.txt

Abstract

   This document reports the results of the OSPFv2 Prefix/Link
   Attributes implementation survey.  The survey has seven questions
   related to the implementer's support of OSPFv2 Prefix/Link
   Attributes.  After a brief summary of the results, each response is
   listed.  This document contains responses from six implementers who
   completed the survey.  No external means were used to verify the
   accuracy of the information submitted by the respondents.  The
   respondents are considered experts on the products they reported on.
   Additionally, responses were omitted from implementers who indicated
   that they have not implemented the function yet.

1.  Introduction

   This document reports the results of the OSPFv2 Prefix/Link
   Attributes [PREFIX-LINK-ATTR] implementation survey.  The survey has
   seven questions related to the implementer's support of OSPFv2
   Prefix/Link Attributes.  The OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attributes are
   extensions to the base OSPFv2 protocol [OSPFV2] to allow additional
   information to be associated with an OSPFv2 link or attribute.  After
   a brief summary of the results, each response is listed.  This
   document contains responses from three implementers who completed the
   survey.  No external means were used to verify the accuracy of the
   information submitted by the respondents.  The respondents are
   considered experts on the products they reported on.  Additionally,

   responses were omitted from implementers who indicated that they have
   not implemented the function yet.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  Summary Results of Survey

   Three vendors replied to the survey.  These include Alcatel-Lucent,
   Cisco, and Huawei.  Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent also did
   interoperability testing.  The Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent
   implementations are in released software versions and the Huawei
   implementation release is pending.  For prefix attributes, the recent
   change incorporating the A-Flag is pending implementation by Alcatel-
   Lucent and Huawei.  Implementation of the N-flag is pending Huawei
   implementation.  Otherwise, the vendors have full implementations of
   [PREFIX-LINK-ATTR].  For all three vendors, segment routing
   [SEGMENT-ROUTING] was an application making use of the extensions.
   Additionally, Cisco has implemented Topology-Independent Loop-Free
   Alternatives (TI-LFA) [TI-LFA] and Bit Indexed Egress Replication
   (BIER) advertisement [BIER].

3.  Implementation Survey Results

3.1.  Alcatel-Lucent

   The Alcatel-Lucent responses to the survey questions are as follows:

   2.  Have you implemented the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix opaque LSA and
       OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV?  Yes

   3.  If yes for #3, have you implemented the A and N flags which have
       been moved from the segment routing extensions?  Yes for N-flag,
       A-flag not yet.

   4.  Have you implemented the OSPFv2 Extended Link opaque LSA and
       OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV?  Yes

   5.  In your implementation, what applications utilize the OSPFv2
       Extended Prefix/Link attributes (e.g., segment routing)?  Segment
