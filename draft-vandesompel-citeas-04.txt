   cite-as: A Link Relation to Convey a Preferred URI for Referencing
                      draft-vandesompel-citeas-04

Abstract

   A web resource is routinely referenced by means of the URI with which
   it is directly accessed.  But cases exist where referencing a
   resource by means of a URI, different than that access URI, is
   preferred.  This specification defines a link relation type that can
   be used to convey such a preference.

1.  Introduction

   A web resource is routinely referenced (e.g. linked, bookmarked) by
   means of the URI with which it is directly accessed.  But cases exist
   where referencing a resource by means of a different URI is
   preferred, for example because the latter URI is intended to be more
   persistent over time.  Currently, there is no link relation type to
   convey such alternative referencing preference; this specification
   addresses this deficit by introducing a link relation type intended
   for that purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as
   defined in [RFC8288].  These terms respectively correspond with
   "Context IRI" and "Target IRI" as used in [RFC5988].  Although
   defined as IRIs, in common scenarios they are also URIs.

   Additionally, this specification uses the following terms:

   o  "access URI": A URI at which a user agent accesses a web resource.

   o  "reference URI": A URI, other than the access URI, that should
      preferentially be used for referencing.

   By interacting with the access URI, the user agent may discover typed
   links.  For such links, the access URI is the link context.

3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Persistent Identifiers

   Despite sound advice regarding the design of Cool URIs [CoolURIs],
   link rot ("HTTP 404 Not Found") is a common phenomena when following
   links on the web.  Certain communities of practice (see examples,
   below) have introduced solutions to combat this problem that
   typically consist of:

   o  Accepting the reality that the web location of a resource - the
      access URI - may change over time.

   o  Minting an additional URI for the resource - the reference URI -
      that is specifically intended to remain persistent over time.

   o  Redirecting (typically "HTTP 301 Moved Permanently", "HTTP 302
      Found", or "HTTP 303 See Other") from the reference URI to the
      access URI.

   o  As a community of practice, committing to adjust that redirection
      whenever the access URI changes over time.

   This approach is, for example, used by:




Van de Sompel, et al.     Expires June 21, 2019                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


   o  Scholarly publishers that use DOIs [DOIs] to identify articles and
      DOI URLs [DOI-URLs] as a means to keep cross-publisher article-to-
      article links operational, even when the journals in which the
      articles are published change hands from one publisher to another,
      for example, as a result of an acquisition.

   o  Authors of controlled vocabularies that use PURLs (Persistent
      Uniform Resource Locators) [PURLs] for vocabulary terms to ensure
      that the URIs they assign to vocabulary terms remain stable even
      if management of the vocabulary is transfered to a new custodian.

   o  A variety of organizations, including libraries, archives, and
      museums that assign ARK URLs [draft-kunze-ark-18] to information
      objects in order to support long-term access.

   In order for the investments in infrastructure involved in these
   approaches to pay off, and hence for links to effectively remain
   operational as intended, it is crucial that a resource be referenced
   by means of its reference URI.  However, the access URI is where a
   user agent actually accesses the resource (e.g., it is the URI in the
   browser's address bar).  As such, there is a considerable risk that
   the access URI instead of the reference URI is used for referencing
   [PIDs-must-be-used].

   The link relation type defined in this document makes it possible for
   user agents to differentiate the reference URI from the access URI.

3.2.  Version Identifiers

   Resource versioning systems often use a naming approach whereby:

   o  The most recent version of a resource is at any time available at
      the same, generic URI.

   o  Each version of the resource - including the most recent one - has
      a distinct version URI.

   For example, Wikipedia uses generic URIs of the form
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe and version URIs of the form
   https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Doe&oldid=776253882.

   While the current version of a resource is accessed at the generic
   URI, some versioning systems adhere to a policy that favors linking
   and referencing a specific version URI.  To express this using the
   terminology of Section 2, these policies intend that the generic URI
   is the access URI, and that the version URI is the reference URI.
   These policies are informed by the understanding that the content at
   the generic URI is likely to evolve over time, and that accurate



Van de Sompel, et al.     Expires June 21, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


   links or references should lead to the content as it was at the time
   of referencing.  To that end, Wikipedia's "Permanent link" and "Cite
   this page" functionalities promote the version URI, not the generic
   URI.

   The link relation type defined in this document makes it possible for
   user agents to differentiate the version URI from the generic URI.

3.3.  Preferred Social Identifier

   A web user commonly has multiple profiles on the web, for example,
   one per social network, a personal homepage, a professional homepage,
   a FOAF (Friend Of A Friend) profile [FOAF], etc.  Each of these
   profiles is accessible at a distinct URI.  But the user may have a
   preference for one of those profiles, for example, because it is most
   complete, kept up-to-date, or expected to be long-lived.  As an
   example, the first author of this document has, among others, the
   following profile URIs:

   o  https://hvdsomp.info

   o  https://twitter.com/hvdsomp

   o  https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbertvandesompel/

   o  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0715-6126

   Of these, from the perspective of the person described by these
   profiles, the first URI may be the preferred profile URI for the
   purpose of referencing because the domain is not under the
   custodianship of a third party.  When an agent accesses another
   profile URI, such as https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0715-6126, this
   preference for referencing by means of the first URI could be
   expressed.

   The link relation type defined in this specification makes it
   possible for user agents to differentiate the preferred profile URI
   from the accessed profile URI.

3.4.  Multi-Resource Publications

   When publishing on the web, it is not uncommon to make distinct
   components of a publication available as different web resources,
   each with their own URI.  For example:

   o  Contemporary scholarly publications routinely consists of a
      traditional article as well as additional materials that are
      considered an integral part of the publication such as



Van de Sompel, et al.     Expires June 21, 2019                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


      supplementary information, high-resolution images, or a video
      recording of an experiment.

   o  Scientific or governmental open data sets frequently consist of
      multiple files.

   o  Online books typically consist of multiple chapters.

   While each of these components is accessible at its distinct URI -
   the access URI - they often also share a URI assigned to the
   intellectual publication of which they are components - the reference
   URI.

   The link relation type defined in this document makes it possible for
   user agents to differentiate the URI of the intellectual publication
   from the access URI of a component of the publication.

4.  The "cite-as" Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for the
    Purpose of Referencing

   A link with the "cite-as" relation type indicates that, for
   referencing the link context, use of the URI of the link target is
   preferred over use of the URI of the link context.  It allows the
   resource identified by the access URI (link context) to unambiguously
   link to its corresponding reference URI (link target), thereby
   expressing that the link target is preferred over the link context
   for the purpose of permanent citation.

   The link target of a "cite-as" link SHOULD support protocol-based
   access as a means to ensure that applications that store them can
   effectively re-use them for access.

   The link target of a "cite-as" link SHOULD provide the ability for a
   user agent to follow its nose back to the context of the link, e.g.
   by following redirects and/or links.  This helps a user agent to
   establish trust in the target URI.

   Because a link with the "cite-as" relation type expresses a preferred
   URI for the purpose of referencing, the access URI SHOULD only
   provide one link with that relation type.  If more than one "cite-as"
   link is provided, the user agent may decide to select one (e.g. an
   HTTP URI over a mailto URI), for example, based on the purpose that
   the reference URI will serve.

   Providing a link with the "cite-as" relation type does not prevent
   using the access URI for the purpose of referencing if such
   specificity is needed for the application at hand.  For example, in
   the case of scenario Section 3.4 the access URI is likely required



Van de Sompel, et al.     Expires June 21, 2019                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


   for the purpose of annotating a specific component of an intellectual
   publication.  Yet, the annotation application may also want to
   appropriately include the reference URI in the annotation.

   Applications can leverage the information provided by a "cite-as"
   link in a variety of ways, for example:

   o  Bookmarking tools and citation managers can take this preference
      into account when recording a URI.

   o  Webometrics applications that trace URIs can trace both the access
      URI and the reference URI.

   o  Discovery tools can support look-up by means of both the access
      and the reference URI.  This includes web archives that typically
      make archived versions of web resources discoverable by means of
      the original access URI of the archived resource; they can
      additionally make these archived resources discoverable by means
      of the associated reference URI.

5.  Distinction with Other Relation Types

   Some existing IANA-registered relationships intuitively resemble the
   relationship that "cite-as" is intended to convey.  But a closer
   inspection of these candidates provided in the blog posts
   [identifier-blog], [canonical-blog], and [bookmark-blog] shows that
   they are not appropriate for various reasons and that a new relation
   type is required.  The remainder of this section provides a summary
   of the detailed explanations provided in the referenced blog posts.

   It can readily be seen that the following relation types do not
   address the requirements described in Section 3:

   o  "alternate" [RFC4287]: The link target provides an alternate
      version of the content at the link context.  These are typically
      variants according to dimensions that are subject to content
      negotiation, for example the same content with varying Content-
      Type (e.g., application/pdf vs. text/html) and/or Content-Language
      (e.g., en vs. fr).  The representations provided by the context
      URIs and target URIs in the scenarios of Section 3.1 through
      Section 3.4 are not variants in the sense intended by [RFC4287],
      and, as such, the use of "alternate" is not appropriate.

   o  "duplicate" [RFC6249]: The link target is a resource whose
      available representations are byte-for-byte identical with the
      corresponding representations of the link context, for example, an
      identical file on a mirror site.  In none of the above scenarios




Van de Sompel, et al.     Expires June 21, 2019                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


      do the link context and the link target provide identical content.
      As such, the use of "duplicate" is not appropriate.

   o  "related" [RFC4287]: The link target is a resource that is related
      to the link context.  While "related" could be used in all of the
      above scenarios, its semantics are too vague to convey the
      specific semantics intended by "cite-as".

   Two existing IANA-registered relationships deserve closer attention
   and are discussed in the remainder of this section.

5.1.  bookmark

   "bookmark" [W3C.REC-html5-20151028]: The link target provides a URI
   for the purpose of bookmarking the link context.

   The intent of "bookmark" is closest to that of "cite-as" in that the
   link target is intended to be a permalink for the link context, for
   bookmarking purposes.  The relation type dates back to the earliest
   days of news syndication, before blogs and news feeds had permalinks
   to identify individual resources that were aggregated into a single
   page.  As such, its intent is to provide permalinks for different
   sections of an HTML document.  It was originally used with HTML
   elements such as <div>, <h1>, <h2>, etc. and, more recently, HTML5
   revised it to be exclusively used with the <article> element.
   Moreover, it is explictly excluded from use in the <link> element in
   HTML <head>, and, as a consequence, in the HTTP Link header that is
   semantically equivalent.  For these technical and semantic reasons,
   the use of "bookmark" to convey the relationship intented by "cite-
   as" is not appropriate.

   A more detailed justification regarding the inappropriatenss of
   "bookmark", including a thorough overview of its turbulent history,
   is provided in [bookmark-blog].

5.2.  canonical

   "canonical" [RFC6596]: The meaning of "canonical" is commonly
   misunderstood on the basis of its brief definition as being "the
   preferred version of a resource."  The description in the abstract of
   [RFC6596] is more helpful and states that "canonical" is intended to
   link to a resource that is preferred over resources with duplicative
   content.  A more detailed reading of [RFC6596] clarifies that the
   intended meaning is preferred for the purpose of content indexing.  A
   typical use case is linking from each page in a multi-page magazine
   article to a single page version of the article provided for indexing
   by search engines: the former pages provide content that is




Van de Sompel, et al.     Expires June 21, 2019                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


   duplicative to the superset content that is available at the latter
   page.

   The semantics intended by "canonical" as preferred for the purpose of
   content indexing differ from the semantics intended by "cite-as" as
   preferred for the purpose of referencing.  A further exploration of
   the various scenarios shows that the use of "canonical" is not
   appropriate to convey the semantics intended by "cite-as":

   o  Scenario of Section 3.1: The reference URI that is intended to be
      persistent over time does not serve content that needs to be
      indexed, it merely redirects to the access URI.  Since the meaning
      intended by "canonical" is "preferred for the purpose of content
      indexing", it is not appropriate to point at the reference URI
      (persistent identifier) using the "canonical" relation type.
      Moreover, Section 6.1 shows that scholarly publishers that assign
      persistent identifiers, already use the "canonical" relation type
      for search engine optimization, and how that use contrasts with
      the intended use of "cite-as".

   o  Scenario of Section 3.2: In most common cases, custodians of
      resource versioning systems want search engines to index the most
      recent version of a page and hence would use a "canonical" link to
      point from version URIs of a resource to the associated generic
      URI.  Wikipedia effectively does this.  However, for some resource
      versioning systems, including Wikipedia, for the purpose of
      referencing, version URIs are preferred.  As such, a "cite-as"
      link would point from the generic URI to the most recent version
      URI.  That is, in the opposite direction of the "canonical" link.

   o  Scenario of Section 3.3: The content at the link target and the
      link context are different profiles for a same person.  Each
      profile, not just a preferred one, should be indexed.  But a
      single one could be preferred for referencing.

   o  Scenario of Section 3.4: The content at the link target, if any,
      would typically be a landing page that includes descriptive
      metadata pertaining to the multi-resource publication and links to
      its component resources.  Each component resource provides content
      that is different, not duplicative, to the landing page.

   A more detailed justification regarding how the use of "canonical" is
   inappropriate to address the requirements described in this document,
   including examples, is provided in [canonical-blog].

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 through Section 6.4 show examples of the use of
   links with the "cite-as" relation type.  They illustrate how the
   typed links can be used in a response header and/or response body.

6.1.  Persistent HTTP URI

   PLOS ONE is one of many scholarly publishers that assigns DOIs to the
   articles it publishes.  For example, https://doi.org/10.1371/
   journal.pone.0171057 is the persistent identifier for such an
   article.  Via the DOI resolver, this persistent identifier redirects
   to http://journals.plos.org/plosone/doi?id=10.1371/
   journal.pone.0171057 in the plos.org domain.  This URI itself
   redirects to http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/
   journal.pone.0171057, which delivers the actual article in HTML.

   The HTML article contains a <link> element with the "canonical"
   relation type pointing at itself,
   http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/
   journal.pone.0167475.  As per Section 5.2, this indicates that the
   article content at that URI should be indexed by search engines.

   PLOS ONE can additionally provide a link with the "cite-as" relation
   type pointing at the persistent identifier to indicate it is the
   preferred URI for permanent citation of the article.  Figure 1 shows
   the addition of the "cite-as" link both in the HTTP header and the
   HTML that results from an HTTP GET on the article URI
   http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/
   journal.pone.0167475.

6.2.  Version URIs

   The preprint server arXiv.org has a versioning approach like the one
   described in Section 3.2:

   o  The most recent version of a preprint is at any time available at
      the same, generic URI.  Consider the preprint with generic URI
      https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787.

   o  Each version of the preprint - including the most recent one - has
      a distinct version URI.  The considered preprint has two versions
      with respective version URIs https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787v1
      (published 10 November 2017) and https://arxiv.org/
      abs/1711.03787v2 (published 24 January 2018).

   A reader who accessed https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787 between 10
   November 2017 and 23 January 2018, obtained the first version of the
   preprint.  Starting 24 January 2018, the second version was served at
   that URI.  In order to support accurate referencing, arXiv.org could
   implement the "cite-as" link to point from the generic URI to the
   most recent version URI.  In doing so, assuming the existence of
   reference manager tools that consume "cite-as" links:

   o  The reader who accesses https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787 between
      10 November 2017 and 23 January 2018 would reference
      https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787v1.

   o  The reader who accesses https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787 starting
      24 January 2018 would reference https://arxiv.org/
      abs/1711.03787v2.

   Figure 2 shows the header that arXiv.org would have returned in the
   first case, in response to a HTTP HEAD on the generic URI
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787.

6.3.  Preferred Profile URI

   If the access URI is the home page of John Doe, John can add a link
   with the "cite-as" relation type to it, as a means to convey that he
   would preferably be referenced by means of the URI of his FOAF
   profile.  Figure 3 shows the response to an HTTP GET on the URI of
   John's home page.

6.4.  Multi-Resource Publication

   The Dryad Digital Repository at datadryad.org specializes in hosting
   and preserving scientific datasets.  Each dataset typically consists
   of multiple resources.  For example, the dataset "Data from: Climate,
   demography, and lek stability in an Amazonian bird" consists of an
   Excel spreadsheet, a csv file, and a zip file.  Each of these
   resources have different content and are accessible at their
   respective URIs.  In addition, the dataset has a landing page at
   https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5d23f.

   Each of these resources should be permanently cited by means of the
   persistent identifier that was assigned to the entire dataset as an
   intellectual publication, i.e.  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5d23f.
   To that end, the Dryad Digital Repository can add "cite-as" links
   pointing from the URIs of each of these resources to
   https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5d23f.  This is shown in Figure 4 for
   the csv file that is a component resource of the dataset, through use
   of the HTTP Link header.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Link Relation Type: cite-as

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 2.1.1 of [RFC8288]:

      Relation Name: cite-as

Internet-Draft              cite-as relation               December 2018


      Description: A link with the "cite-as" relation type indicates
      that the link target is preferred over the link context for the
      purpose of permanent citation.

      Reference: [[ This document ]]

8.  Security Considerations

   In cases where there is no way for the agent to automatically verify
   the correctness of the reference URI (cf.  Section 4), out-of-band
   mechanisms might be required to establish trust.

   If a trusted site is compromised, the "cite-as" link relation could
   be used with malicious intent to supply misleading URIs for
   referencing.  Use of these links might direct user agents to an
   attacker's site, break the referencing record they are intended to
   support, or corrupt algorithmic interpretation of referencing data.
