1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) Working Group is chartered
   with providing architecture and mechanisms to inject into and
   retrieve information from the routing system.  The I2RS Architecture
   document [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] abstractly documents a number
   of requirements for implementing the I2RS requirements.

   The I2RS Working Group has chosen to use the YANG data modeling
   language [RFC6020] as the basis to implement its mechanisms.

   Additionally, the I2RS Working group has chosen to use the NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and its similar but lighter-weight relative RESTCONF
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] as the protocols for carrying I2RS.
   NETCONF and RESTCONF are suitable for handling the configuration
   portion of the I2RS protocol, but need extensions to handle the I2RS

   use cases described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary].  The
   requirements for these functionalities include:

   o  ephemeral state - as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state]

   o  notifications and events - as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements]

   o  traceability - as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability]

   o  protocol security - as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements]

   o  Generic interfaces to Protocol Local-RIBs or Policy Data bases,

   o  Large data flows,

   o  Traffic monitoring data,

   o  Data flows for Action sequences, and

   o  data flows during network outages or attacks

   This document describes the protocol requirements for these last five
   types of requirements.  The first section summarizes the data flow
   requirements.  Section 2 details how the I2RS use case requirements
   for Generic interfaces to protocol RIBS or policy data base do not
   add any requirements to the I2RS protocol.  Section 3 describes how
   the describes

2.  Summary of I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   Additional requirements from Generic Interface:None

   The additional Data flow requirements are:

      [DF-REQ-01] Support writing to the ephemeral copy of the Local RIB
      with three different types of checks: minimal data reception
      checks (TLVs of data oacket valid), all non-referential checks
      (e.g. do not do leafref, MUST, instance identifiers), and do
      referential checks via three different rpcs.

      DF-REQ-02: The support of large data transfers in a data format
      agnostic format.  This the I2RS protocol should support transport
      of data in any format including: XML, JSON, MTL (ALias/Waveformat,
      .mtl), protobufs, and ascii text.

      DF-REQ-03: Support of any transport,

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                   March 2016


      DF-REQ-04: Support for the ability to send traffic monitoring
      information using IPFIX protocol and IPFIX templates,

      DF-REQ-05: Support of transmitting traffic statistics for filter-
      based policies (BGP-FS, I2RS FB-RIB, policy routing), IPPM, SFLOW,
      and others in yang data model format or IPFIX templates formats
      over XML or JSON.

      DF-REQ-06: I2RS should be able to support an action which
      allocates internal resources for the I2RS agent (memory,
      processing time, interrupts) and outbound data flow bandwidth.  It
      is expected that an action would be included in a data model in an
      "rpc"-like format in yang.

      DF-REQ-07: The I2RS should be able to support an action that
      interacts with routing OAM functions.

      I2RS-DF-08:I2RS Agent must be able signals that it will be using
      different protocol with different constraints (security, priority
      of data, or transport) or different constraints on the existing
      protocol (smaller message sizes, different priorities on data
      carried, or different security levels).

      I2RS-DF-09:I2RS Agent must be able signals that it will be using
      different protocol with different constraints (security, priority
      of data, or transport) or different constraints on the existing
      protocol (smaller message sizes, different priorities on data
      carried, or different security levels).

      DF-REQ-10: Yang MUST have a way to indicate in a data model has
      actions which allow: different transports, different resource
      constraints, or different security.

      DF-REQ-11: Yang MUST have a way to indicate a data model has
      different levels of checking where: lowest level is message form
      only, medium level checks message format plus data syntax, and
      highest level uses the message format, data syntax and referential
      check netconf configuration does.  The default level for I2RS is
      message format plus data syntax.

3.  Generic Interfaces to Routing Functions

   The I2RS use case requirement suggests that a generic interface be
   created to protocol local RIBs and a generic interface be available
   to configure policies.

3.1.  I2RS-Generic Interface to Local-RIB

   The I2RS requirements ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary]) require
   that a generic interface be defined to the local-RIB in protocols.
   This type of data flow does not require a new type of data flow, but
   the definition of a new data model that creates a generic local RIB
   and has operations to funnel this generic Local-RIB to a specific
   protocol.

   The Protocol Independent Use case (PI-REQ-11) Local RIB use case
   suggest the I2RS protocol has three levels of checks: minimal data
   reception checks (TLVs of data align), all non-referential checks
   (e.g. do not do leafref, MUST, instance identifiers), and do
   referential checks.  This feature could be supported through
   different rpc calls to the LOCAL RIB.

3.2.  I2RS-Generic interfaces to Policies

   The I2RS requirements suggest that I2RS have a generic interface to
   routing policies for protocols, routing distribution, or routing
   protocols.  This generic interface is currently being implemented as
   common definitions for data models.  At this time, This generic
   interface does not need additional protocol requirements.

3.3.  I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   [DF-REQ-01] Support writing to the ephemeral copy of the Local RIB
   with three different types of checks: minimal data reception checks
   (TLVs of data oacket valid), all non-referential checks (e.g. do not
   do leafref, MUST, instance identifiers), and do referential checks
   via three different rpcs.

4.  Large Data Flow Requirements

   This section decribes the data flow requirements for large data
   flows, traffic flows measurements, CDNI traffic flows, OAM and Action
   rqeuests, data flows during outages or network attacks (DDoS
   (Distributed Denial of Service) or other network attacks), and non-
   secure data flows.  These data flows are data flows which are not
   configuration based data flows.

4.1.  Large Data Flow Use Case Requirements

   The I2RS use case for Large Data Collection systems
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary] requires the I2RS protocol and
   data models:

   o  be able to be done at a high frequency and resolution with minimal
      impact to devices memory or CPU (L-Data-REQ-01) ,

   o  use a data model which allows definition of the form as part of
      the data model (L-Data-REQ-02) ,

   o  support a publication/subscription mechanism with push/pull
      mechanism (L-Data-REQ-03),

   o  (supports capability negotiation for level of transport, security,
      and error handling as a general configurations, per I2RS client-
      agent protocol for all interfaces and all time instance, or per
      I2RS interface client-agent protocol per specific interface or per
      time instances.  (L-Data-REQ-04,L-Data-REQ-06, L-Data-REQ-07, L-
      Data-REQ-08, and L-Data-REQ-09),

   o  dynamic subscription model set-up via IPFIX (L-REQ-12c),

   o  support of subscriber and consumer I2RS-Agent pairs (L-REQ-12d),

   o  remapping of Node's databases,

   o  data format agnostic (L-Data-REQ-05),

   o  data models and I2RS protocol additions that support of query,
      introspection using data-base model that support a set of
      capabilities, data filters, and error handling (stale data,
      repeated transport failures, and other errors.)  Introspection
      supports data verification, inclusion of legacy data, and merging
      of data flows based on meta-data.  (L-Data-REQ-11, L-Data-REQ-13),

   o  Support of push of data synchronously or asyncronously via
      registered subscriptions (L-Data-REQ-12a).

   o  Pull of data in one-shot or multiple sequences (L-Data-REQ-12b),
      and

   o  dynamic subscription model set-up via IPFIX Feed (L-REQ-12c)

4.1.1.  Data Requirements Supported in pub-sub Requirements

   All use case requirements for the publication/subscription service
   for the push service from large data requirements 01-04 and 6-12 is
   found in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements], and an example
   protocol addition to netconf is include in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                   March 2016


   The requirements for the publication/subscription service for the
   pull model are not specified in the
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements], but a majority of the pub-sub
   requirements and mechanisms can be reused.  In a pull, the publisher
   prepares the data that is pulled by a few receivers who then
   distribute it to the receivers.  The pull mechanism would have a
   different "pull latency" versus the push latencey, and a set of
   parameters which indicate the amount of data stored if receivers did
   not pull the data within a certain time.

   At this time, the pull-model of the publication/subscription model is
   not being requested by vendors or operators.

4.1.2.  Data Flow Requirements Outside of Pub/Sub Requirements

   The data flow requirements for large data flows also include support
   for data flows outside of publication/subscription via any transport
   (L-Dat-REQ-04) and any data format (L-Data-REQ-05).  Support for the
   IPFIX protocol or just the IPFIX data formats is required.

4.1.3.  I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   The following requirements are additional data flow requirements for
   large data flows.

      (DF-REQ-01): Support of any data format including: XML, JSON, (MTL
      (Alias/WaveFormat,.mtl), protobufs, and ascii,

      (DF-REQ-02): Support of any transport, and

      (DF-REQ-03): support of the ability send information using IPFIX
      templates as a reporting structure over the IPFIX protocol.

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] supports XML and JSON in its first
   release, and provides an ability to register extra formats, but these
   requirements should also support large data flows sent outside of the
   publication-subscription service.

4.2.  Traffic Flow Measurements

   The I2RS requirements for the Protocol independent use cases requires
   the support off interactions with traffic flow and other network
   management Protocols (requirements PI-REQ-05, PI-REQ06) in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary]).

   The following IETF protocol pass traffic related information:

   o  BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) ([RFC5575]



Hares                  Expires September 16, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                   March 2016


   o  IPFIX - IP Flow Information ([RFC7011]) that reports on a wide
      variety of routing system statistics, and

   o  IPPM - IP Performance mangement ([RFC2330], [RFC7312]) that
      reports on one-way or two-way end-to-end network performance
      statistics,

   In addition the SFLOW([RFC3176]) of layer 2 devices is supported by
   many routers.  Other traffic flows may be measured in support of IDS/
   IPS, but these will be covered in the section on security flows.

   Additional traffic flow models are being defined to configure traffic
   flow policy and to monitor the statistics on the use of the traffic
   flow statistics:

   o  BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) yang model
      [I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg] contains flow filter match
      statistics.

   o  I2RS Filter-Based RIB yang model
      ([I-D.kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model],
      [I-D.hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model])- yang model contains ephemeral
      flow statistics,

   o  Filter-Based RIB (draft-hares-rtgwg-fb-rib-data-model) contains
      both flow filter match statistics,

4.2.1.  Protocol Requirements based on Traffic Flows

   Due to the potentially large data flow these statistics should be
   handle by push pub-sub model or a pull pub-sub model.  Thresholds for
   data models may be passed by the event portion of the push/pull pub-
   sub model.  The pub-sub model will allow the I2RS client-I2RS Agent
   to meter the amount of data flow these statistics carry.  The push
   portion of the pub-sub model is supported by
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], but the pull portion of the pub-sub
   model is not defined.

   Alternatively I2RS can use the the IPFIX protocol ([RFC7011]) as a
   component protocol.  I2RS processes can support an IPFIX exporting
   process sendinging dta to a node to a node on a collector process.
   The IPFIX templates can be configured as ephemeral state or
   configuration state.  The IPFIX data flows may run over SCTP, UDP, or
   TCP utilizing the congestion services at each time.  The IPFIX
   connections assumes that: a) congestion is an temporary anomaly, b)
   dropping data during a congestion is reported, and c) for some
   exporiting process it is acceptable to have drop data in a reliable

   protocol.  The I2RS protocol must support the establishment of an
   IPFIX connection.

   Traffic monitoring can occur in a network under DDoS with high levels
   of congestion and loss the use of these protocols which rely on
   transport-level retransmission may not be as resilient as needed for
   network security functions (NSF).  These are considered in section 5
   on operations during network outages or congestoin.

   The Flow Filtering data models with policy rules (BGP Flow
   Specification, I2RS Filter-Based RIB, and n-tuple policy routing RIB)
   often track how often these policies are match.  These statistics can
   also be pushed/pulled in a publication/subscription with yang data-
   model defined format or an IPFIX exporting process format.  Similarly
   IPPM statistics or SFLOW data, be sent via publication/subscription
   service in yang data model format or in a IPFIX Template or as XML or
   JSON representation of a yang data model.  These additional sources
   do not change the requirements for the push publication/subscription
   or expand the

   Summary: The pub-sub model push or pull may have to support
   additional formats (E.g.  SFLOW, IPFIX) as well as yang data models.

4.2.2.  I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   (DF-REQ-04): Support of traffic statistics for filter-based policies
   (BGP-FS, I2RS FB-RIB, policy routing), IPPM, SFLOW, and others in
   yang data model format or IPFIX template formats over XML or JSON.

4.3.  Action sequences in Data Models

   Several of the I2RS requirements from the use cases require a
   sequence of events with the following actions:

   1.  query data in protocol independent model (topology, RIB, Filter-
       RIB), or protocol),

   2.  start calculation (or re-calculation) in protocol function,

   3.  Report results,

   4.  install topology or RIB calculated,

   5.  check results,

   6.  recycle.

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                   March 2016


   The actions included looking for overlapping BGP routes, IGP LFA
   calculation, ECMP load balancing traffic, optimizing paths via MPLS-
   TE, CCNE re-optimization, and virtual topology creation.

   An alternate pattern within the requirements is if the topology is
   calculated off-line, and uploaded.

   These action patterns may involve an interaction of the I2RS action
   sequences with existing OAM functions in the routing system.

   NETCONF/RESTCONF have the concepts of an "rpc" for a configuration
   enabled action, but these action sequences should have the abilty to
   have the following characteristics:

   o  the ability to request a reservation of resources for this effort
      so the action sequence does not start unless there is enough
      calculation or response bandwidth in a node,

   o  the abilty ability to have validation on off-line calculated data
      so this critical data does not have errors

   o  the ability to "prioritize" notification or reports ahead of other
      I2RS data streams to allow process to work.

4.3.1.  I2RS Data Flow Requirement

   I2RS-DF-REQ-07: I2RS should be able to support an action which
   allocates internal resources for the I2RS agent (memory, processing
   time, interrupts) and outbound data flow bandwidth.  It is expected
   that an action would be included in a data model in an "rpc"-like
   format in yang.

   DF-REQ-08: The I2RS should be able to support an action that
   interacts with routing OAM functions.

4.4.  Operation during network outages or attacks

   The router needs dynamic management during periods of outage or
   periods of security attack.

4.4.1.  Periods of Network Outage

   During periods of outage, the I2RS protocol must operate when data
   bandwidth is reduced and network connectivity fluctuates.  I2RS
   agents must be able to adjust operation of event notifications,
   logging, or data traffic during this period.  Data Models and I2RS
   agent configuration must allow operator-applied policy to prioritize

   data during this period.  The I2RS Agent should be able to signal the
   I2RS Client that such a time period is occuring.

4.4.2.  I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   I2RS-DF-09:I2RS Agent must be able signals that it will be using
   different protocol with different constraints (security, priority of
   data, or transport) or different constraints on the existing protocol
   (smaller message sizes, different priorities on data carried, or
   different security levels).

5.  Changes to YANG

   To support the above requirements, the yang modules will need to
   support the following features:

   o  DF-REQ-10: Yang MUST have a way to indicate in a data model has
      actions which allow: different transports, different resource
      constraints, or different security.

   o  DF-REQ-11: Yang MUST have a way to indicate a data model has
      different levels of checking where: lowest level is message form
      only, medium level checks message format plus data syntax, and
      highest level uses the message format, data syntax and referential
      check netconf configuration does.  The default level for I2RS is
      message format plus data syntax.
