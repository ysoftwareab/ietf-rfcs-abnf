1.  Introduction

   Dates and times are used in a very diverse set of internet
   applications, all the way from server-side logging to calendaring and
   scheduling.

   Each distinct instant in time can be represented in a descriptive
   text format using a timestamp, and [ISO8601] standardizes a widely-
   adopted timestamp format, which forms the basis of [RFC3339].
   However, this format only allows timestamps to contain very little
   additional relevant information, which means that, beyond that, any
   contextual information related to a given timestamp needs to be
   either handled separately or attached to it in a non-standard manner.

   This is already a pressing issue for applications that handle each
   instant with an associated time zone name, to take into account
   events such as daylight saving time transitions.  Most of these
   applications attach the time zone to the timestamp in a non-standard
   format, at least one of which is fairly well-adopted [JAVAZDT].
   Furthermore, applications might want to attach even more information
   to the timestamp, including but not limited to the calendar system in
   which it should be represented.

1.1.  Scope

   This document defines an extension syntax for timestamps as specified
   in [RFC3339] that has the following properties:

   *  The extension suffix is completely optional, making existing
      [RFC3339] timestamps compatible with this format.

   *  The format is compatible with the pre-existing popular syntax for
      attaching time zone names to timestamps ([JAVAZDT]).

   *  The format provides a generalized way to attach any additional
      information to the timestamp.

   This document does not address extensions to the format where the
   semantic result is no longer a fixed timestamp that is referenced to
   a (past or future) UTC time.  For instance, it does not address:

   *  Future time given as a local time in some specified time zone,
      where changes to the definition of that time zone (e.g., a
      political decision to enact or rescind daylight saving time)
      affect the instant in time corresponding with the timestamp.

   *  "Floating time", i.e., a local time without information describing
      the UTC offset or time zone in which it should be interpreted.

   *  The use of time scales different from UTC, such as TAI.

   However, additional information augmenting a fixed timestamp may be
   sufficient to detect an inconsistency between intention and the
   actual information in the timestamp, e.g., between the UTC offset and
   time zone name in the timestamp.  For instance, such an inconsistency
   might arise because of:

   *  Political decisions as discussed above, or

   *  errors in the applications producing and consuming such a
      timestamp.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended                March 2022


   While the information available is not generally sufficient to
   resolve the inconsistency, it may be used to initiate some out of
   band processing to obtain sufficient information for such a
   resolution.

   In order to address some of the requirements implied here, future
   related specifications might define syntax and semantics of strings
   similar to [RFC3339].  Note that the extension syntax defined in the
   present document is designed in such a way that it can be useful for
   such specifications as well.

1.2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   UTC:  Coordinated Universal Time, as maintained since 1988 by the
      Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in conjunction
      with leap seconds as announced by the International Earth Rotation
      and Reference Frames Service [IERS].  From 1972 through 1987, UTC
      was maintained entirely by Bureau International de l'Heure (BIH).
      Before 1972, UTC was not generally recognized and civil time was
      determined by individual jurisdictions using different techniques
      for attempting to follow Universal Time based on measuring the
      rotation of the earth.

      UTC is often mistakenly referred to as GMT, an earlier time scale
      UTC was designed to be a useful successor for.

   ABNF:  Augmented Backus-Naur Form, a format used to represent
      permissible strings in a protocol or language, as defined in
      [RFC5234].  The rules defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234] are
      imported implicitly.

   Internet Date/Time Format:  The date/time format defined in section 3
      of this document.

   Timestamp:  An unambiguous representation of some instant in time.

   Z:  A suffix which, when applied to a time, denotes a UTC offset of
      00:00; often spoken "Zulu" from the ICAO phonetic alphabet
      representation of the letter "Z" (from Section 2 of [RFC3339]).

   Time Zone:  A time zone that is included in the Time Zone Database
      (often called tz or zoneinfo) maintained by IANA.

   CLDR:  Common locale data repository [CLDR], a project of the Unicode
      Consortium to provide locale data to applications.

   For more information about time scales, see Appendix E of [RFC1305],
   Section 3 of [ISO8601], and the appropriate ITU documents
   [ITU-R-TF.460-6].

2.  Extended Date/Time format

   This section discusses desirable qualities of formats for the
   timestamp extension suffix and defines such a format that extends
   [RFC3339] for use in Internet protocols.

2.1.  Informative

   The format is intended to allow implementations to specify additional
   important information in addition to the bare timestamp.

   This is done by defining _tags_, each with a _key_ and a _value_
   separated by an equals sign.  The value of a tag can be one or more
   items delimited by hyphen/minus signs.

   Applications can build an informative timestamp _suffix_ using any
   number of these tags.

   Keys are case-sensitive.  Values are case-sensitive unless otherwise
   specified.

   When a suffix contains a repeated key or otherwise conflicting tags,
   implementations MUST give precedence to whichever value is positioned
   first.
   // I'd rather place a MUST NOT for this case, first.  This definitely
   // needs to be expanded into some general text about error handling.
   //
   // -- --- cabo

2.2.  Registered

   Actual suffix tag keys are registered by supplying the information
   specified in this section.  This information is modeled after that
   specified for the media type registry [RFC6838]; if in doubt, the
   provisions of this registry should be applied analogously.

   Key Identifier:  The key.

   Registration status:  "Provisional" or "Permanent"

   Description:  A very brief description of the key.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended                March 2022


   Change controller:  Who is in control of evolving the specification
      governing values for this key.  This information can include email
      addresses of contact points and discussion lists, and references
      to relevant web pages (URLs).

   Reference:  A reference.  For permanent tag keys, this includes a
      full specification.  For provisional tag keys, there is an
      expectation that some information is available even if that does
      not amount to a full specification; in this case, the registrant
      is expected to improve this information over time.

   Key names that start with an underscore are intended for experiments
   in controlled environments and cannot be registered; such keys MUST
   NOT be used for interchange and MUST be rejected by implementations
   not specifically configured to take part in such an experiment.  See
   [BCP178] for a discussion about the danger of experimental keys
   leaking out to general production and why that MUST be prevented.

3.  Syntax Extensions to RFC 3339

3.1.  ABNF

   The following rules extend the ABNF syntax defined in [RFC3339] in
   order to allow the inclusion of an optional suffix.

   The extended date/time format is described by the rule date-time-ext.
   date-time is imported from Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], ALPHA and DIGIT
   from Appendix B.1 of [RFC5234].

   time-zone-initial = ALPHA / "." / "_"
   time-zone-char    = time-zone-initial / DIGIT / "-" / "+"
   time-zone-part    = time-zone-initial *13(time-zone-char)
                       ; but not "." or ".."
   time-zone-name    = time-zone-part *("/" time-zone-part)
   time-zone         = "[" time-zone-name "]"

   key-initial       = ALPHA / "_"
   key-char          = key-initial / DIGIT / "-"
   suffix-key        = key-initial *key-char

   suffix-value      = 1*alphanum
   suffix-values     = suffix-value *("-" suffix-value)
   suffix-tag        = "[" suffix-key "=" suffix-values "]"
   suffix            = [time-zone] *suffix-tag

   date-time-ext     = date-time suffix

   alphanum          = ALPHA / DIGIT

              Figure 1: ABNF grammar of extensions to RFC 3339

   Note that a time-zone is syntactically similar to a suffix-tag, but
   does not include an equals sign.  This special case is only available
   for time zone tags.

3.2.  Examples

   Here are some examples of Internet extended date/time format.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00

             Figure 2: RFC 3339 date-time with time zone offset

   Figure 2 represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of
   December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC.  Note that
   this is the same instant in time as 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z, expressed
   in UTC.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]

                     Figure 3: Adding a time zone name

   Figure 3 represents the exact same instant as the previous example
   but additionally specifies the human time zone associated with it
   ("Pacific Time") for time-zone-aware implementations to take into
   account.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles][u-ca=hebrew]

                Figure 4: Projecting to the Hebrew calendar

   Figure 4 represents the exact same instant, but it informs calendar-
   aware implementations that they should project it to the Hebrew
   calendar.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[_foo=bar][_baz=bat]

                     Figure 5: Adding experimental tags

   Figure 5, based on Figure 2, utilizes keys identified as experimental
   by a leading underscore to declare two additional pieces of
   information in the suffix; these can be interpreted by
   implementations that take part in the controlled experiment making
   use of these tag keys.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish a registry called "Timestamp Suffix
   Tag Keys".  Each entry in the registry shall consist of the
   information described in Section 2.2.  Initial contents of the
   registry are specified in Section 2.2.
   // We need to actually do this; see github issue #4.

   The registration policy [RFC8126] is "Specification Required" for
   permanent entries, and "Expert Review" for provisional ones.  In the
   second case, the expert is instructed to ascertain that a basic
   specification does exist, even if not complete or published yet.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
