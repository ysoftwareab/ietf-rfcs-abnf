   Each potential capability configuration contains a single information
   capability attribute number where 'info-cap-num' is the information
   capability number defined explicitly earlier in this document, and
   hence must be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included).  The information
   capability allows the expression of only a single capability in each
   alternative, since no more than a single information field is
   permitted per media block.  Nevertheless, it is still allowed to
   express alternative potential information configurations separated by
   a vertical bar ("|").
