1. Introduction

   Using three industrial wireless networking standards:
   ISA100[ISA100.11a], WirelessHART[WirelessHART] and WIA-PA[WIA-PA], a
   deterministic network can be constructed by industrial field network.
   However, this industrial field networks belonging to small and
   medium-size networks whose network coverage is constant, for example,
   a range of plant. Therefore, Industrial backhaul network can be
   introduced to make the industrial field network access higher-level
   network, or transit to other industrial field networks. Thus, a new
   architecture network, the deterministic   industrial field networks
   - backhaul network is proposed in this draft. Some questions of
   deterministic network have been described in the draft [draft-finn-
   detnet-problem-statement-04], and architecture and application have
   been illustrated in [draft-finn-detnet-architecture-04] and [draft-
   bas-usecase-detnet-02] separately.

   Used in industrial production, it has a very high demand on the
   network data packet loss ratio, low jitter and deterministic and so
   on. Besides, due to the backhaul network is heterogeneous with field

   Network. The backhaul industry network, has a centralized controller,
   can schedule network resources such as bandwidth and cache. However,
   for some industrial field networks such as ISA100, WirelessHART,
   these networks have their own system manager. At the same time,
   there are some networks which have no system manager. Therefore, it
   is an issue to be studied about how to carry out joint scheduling.

2. Network Structure

   As shown in the figure 1, it is a typical deterministic industrial
   field networks - backhaul networks structure. The field network is
   composed of ISA100, which is the standard of the international
   industrial wireless network. This network standard uses TDMA
   mechanism to make the network time slot, and provides the
   deterministic guarantee for the data. Then the field networks can be
   access to industrial backhaul networks. At the other end of
   industrial backhaul networks, can be another industrial field
   networks, and can also be access to the Internet application, or
   into enterprise information management system like MES/ERP.

   Thus, in such a network structure, the former field network nodes
   deployed in a plant can communicate with the field network nodes
   deployed in another plant through the industrial backhaul network.
   At the same time, the Internet and information management system can
   manage the sensor nodes of the field network remotely through the
   industrial backhaul network.

3. Joint scheduling requirements

3.1. Determinacy

   The data of industrial field network directly related to the
   monitoring and control of industrial production process, so the
   requirement of data determinism is very high, need data to arrive at
   a certain time. Industrial field network-backhaul network is also a
   kind of network which is mainly used in the process of industrial
   production, so also need to meet the needs of the data determinism
   in the joint scheduling.

3.2. Time Synchronization

   Since the industrial field/backhaul network is a converged network
   and need some scheduling methods to ensure deterministic data stream.
   So it requires high time synchronization accuracy between devices in
   the network. The time synchronization accuracy should be in a range
   of 10ns to 10ms according to different network applications. At
   present, the existing time synchronization protocol include IEEE1588
   and IEEE802.1 As, which is developed by following Time Sensitive
   Networking (TSN) Task Group

3.3. Compatibility

   Industrial field network and backhaul network are both heterogeneous
   networks. Industrial field networks such as ISA100, WirelessHART
   usually have built-in systems management, which can allocate network
   communication resources to conduct deterministic scheduling. Some
   field networks have no system manager. While industrial backhaul
   network is able to control the network with central controller, so
   some mechanisms, interfaces, etc. will be necessary when conducting
   joint scheduling to be compatibility with industrial field/backhaul
   network.

3.4. Scalability

   Generally, the field network data cannot be transmitted across
   domain or across network, while in the deterministic industrial
   field/backhaul network, the characteristic of cross-networks should

   be supported. So data scalability should be ensured during joint
   scheduling process.
