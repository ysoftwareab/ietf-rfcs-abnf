        Abstract 
         
           This document provides an analysis of certain inter-working problems 
           between IPv6 nodes running Mobile IPv6, at least one of which is 
           connected to a  Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)  
           specified General Packet Radio Service/Universal Mobile Tele- 
           communications System (GPRS/UMTS) network. The inter-working problems

       Internet-Draft      MIPv6 and GPRS Packet Filtering            July 2006 
         
           are caused by some specific packet filtering operations at the edge  
           of the GPRS/UMTS network which are applied to control access to the 
           GPRS/UMTS services and network resources. However, we believe that 
           other scenarios may exist in which similar packet filtering  
           operations may be applied and that similar problems would arise in 
           these more general scenarios. 
         
           The GPRS Gateway Support Node (GGSN) checks the source  address or  
           the destination address in the basic IPv6 header of incoming or  
           outgoing IP datagrams against a set of packet filtering information 
           established during the GPRS/UMTS session set-up. The packet filtering 
           information remains stable during the sessions and independent of 
           Mobile IP. When MIPv6 is activated by either end of the IPv6 mobile  
           nodes, the packet filtering  will fail to perform properly and  
           subsequently block the traffic due to the mismatch between the packet 
           filters and the current source address or destination address in the  
           basic IPv6 header of the IP datagrams to and from the IPv6 mobile  
           nodes.

       Internet-Draft      MIPv6 and GPRS Packet Filtering            July 2006 
         
         
        1. Introduction 
         
           Mobile IPv6 [1] allows a mobile node to maintain its IP connectivity 
           regardless of its network attachment point. Packets sent to the 
           mobile node may still use its home address, or the care-of address of 
           the mobile node as the destination address. The mobile  node may 
           continue to communicate with its existing communication peers 
           (stationary or mobile) by using its topologically correct IP 
           addresses. An important  and highly desirable feature of mobile IP 
           based mobility is that the control is transparent to transport and 
           higher-layer protocols and applications, i.e. the higher layer 
           protocols and applications function as if the mobile node is 
           "stationary". 
            
           Packet filtering in GPRS/UMTS [2] is used  for differentiating 
           GPRS/UMTS connections and Quality of Service (QoS), and protecting
           the network resources and services against Theft of Service attacks.
           It is achieved by checking the header information of the incoming and
           outgoing IP datagrams against a set of packet filtering information.
           The packet filtering information is defined or authorised by the
           application layer entities during the set-up of the GPRS/UMTS and IP
           Multimedia Subsystem sessions operating independently of Mobile IP.
           This pre-defined packet filtering information is used by the GGSN
           to check the header of  incoming or outgoing  IP datagrams so as to 
           select the appropriate GPRS/UMTS sessions with QoS or control the 
           access to network  resources and IMS services based on the operator 
           defined local  policies. For example, the Service Based Local Policy 
           control (SBLP) [5][6] in UMTS IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS)[4]  
           enables the GGSN to check the destination address for outgoing IP  
           datagrams according to  policy information authorised by the Policy 
           Decision Function during the IMS session establishment. 
         
           When Mobile IPv6 is activated, an IPv6 node sends IP datagrams using 
           Care-of Address as either the destination address or source address 
           while its home address is carried in the extension headers.  The 
           change of source address or destination address in the basic IPv6 
           header from the mobile node's home address to its care-of  address or 
           from one care-of address to another during a session leads to a 
           mismatch with the header information such as the  source address or 
           destination address in the set of parameters  for packet filtering 
           information and, as a result, the discard of incoming or outgoing IP 
           datagrams by the GGSN. 
         
           In the following sections, the  basic packet filtering operations in 
           GPRS/UMTS are described  and followed by the analysis of the  failure 
           of those operations when Mobile IPv6 is activated.

           1.1 Scope of this Document  
            
           This document provides information about the potential problems for 
           mobile terminals to use Mobile IPv6 when at least one of them 
           is connected to the GPRS/UMTS networks. It analyses the scenarios  
           when Mobile IPv6 is applied and  how the problems occur. 
           
           Similar problems may also exist in CDMA2000 as defined by 3GPP2 
           and other Internet technologies such as firewalls. But the  
           discussions in this document are intended to apply to 3GPP compliant 
           GPRS/UMTS networks.

        2. Terminology 
         
            GPRS services  those services provided or accessed by the GPRS/UMTS 
                     networks. They can be a single media service with one 
                     traffic flow or a multimedia service with several 
                     traffic flows.  
                      
            IMS Services   those services provided by the IP Multimedia (Core 
                     Network) Subsystems (IMS). They are distinguished 
                     from the general GPRS Services as defined above in 
                     that the latter are not provided by the IMS. 
            
            
        3. Packet Filtering in 3GPP Networks 
         
           The following sections list some packet filtering operations in GPRS/ 
           UMTS. It is not intended to exhaust all the possible application 
           scenarios for packet filtering operations in 3G networks such as 
           those used by firewalls.

       Internet-Draft      MIPv6 and GPRS Packet Filtering            July 2006 
         
        3.1 Mobile Terminal Defined Packet Filtering for GPRS Services 
         
           The GPRS Services are defined to be those services that are not run  
           on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) [4]. IMS is  defined by 3GPP to 
           provide SIP Based IP multimedia services. To support GPRS services  
           with more than one traffic flow with differentiated QoS,  GPRS/UMTS 
           networks support multiple simultaneous sessions as typically 
           represented by multiple secondary PDP  (Packet Data Protocol) 
           Contexts[2] in association with one Primary PDP Context for each of
           its IP address. Each GPRS/UMTS session may be assigned specific QoS 
           with the necessary network resources  (including radio resources). An 
           incoming IP datagram from the  external public data network such as 
           Internet will be checked by  the GGSN, to decide if there is an 
           existing GPRS/UMTS session  to deliver the datagram  through the 
           network to the mobile terminal.   The basic IPv6 header as well as 
           some higher layer information such as the ports is checked against a 
           Traffic Flow Template (TFT) [3] that contains the packet filtering 
           information such as the IPv4/IPv6 Source Addresses, Protocol 
           Identifier, Source/Destination Ports, etc. 
         
           The TFT is generated by the mobile node and recorded by the GGSN upon 
           a successful establishment of a GPRS/UMTS session for the mobile 
           node. The TFT  only applies when secondary PDP contexts are activated 
           in which case only one PDP context among both the primary PDP context 
           and secondary PDP context(s) is allowed not to have a TFT associated  
           with it. 
            
           The GGSN will use at least one of those packet filter parameters  
           defined in the TFT, primarily the Source Address, to check if an   
           appropriate GPRS/UMTS session has been set up for incoming  traffic. 
           The GGSN searches for a GPRS/UMTS session with the TFT  that contains 
           the parameter values matching those carried in the datagram. For  
           example, the Source IP Address field of each  existing TFT will be  
           compared with the source address carried in the basic IPv6 header of  
           an IPv6 datagram. If no matching TFT is found, the datagram may be  
           discarded. 
            
        3.2 Mobile Terminal Defined Packet Filtering for IMS Services 
            
           For a UE running IMS Services, the GGSN ignores any UE supplied TFT. 
           The filters in that TFT are not installed in the packet processing 
           table at the GGSN. The packet filtering  for IMS services is based 
           on the Service Based Local Policy as discussed in the next section. 
         
         
        3.3 Network Service Defined Packet Filtering for IMS Services 
         
           In IMS, Service Based  Local Policy (SBLP) [5][6] is enforced by the 
           GGSN to  authorise and control the access to the IMS services and the 
           GPRS/UMTS network resources based on operator defined local policies. 
           The SBLP can be applied to both the traffic leaving  the GPRS/UMTS

            networks (uplink) and the traffic entering the GPRS/UMTS network 
           (downlink). 
            
           An IMS service request, a GPRS/UMTS session set-up request and the 
           subsequent data packets originated by the mobile terminal will be 
           checked by the GGSN against a set of policy control information 
           parameters such as Destination  Address, Destination  Port Number, 
           Transport Protocol ID, etc. The policy control information is issued 
           as an authorisation from the IMS application layer (the IMS/Policy
           Decision Function -PDF). An IP datagram carrying an IMS service 
           request or user data will be blocked by the GGSN if mismatch is found
           between the authorised policy information and those carried by the IP 
           datagram. For example, an IMS service request or a VoIP packet will 
           be blocked by the GGSN if the destination address carried by the IP 
           datagram does not match that authorised by the Policy Decision 
           Function. This is designed for protecting GPRS/UMTS and IMS against 
           ToS attacks. 
         
         
        4. Problem statement 
         
           The problem is stated in terms of an IPv6 node, A,  communicating 
           with a second IPv6 node, B. B is connected to the GPRS/UMTS network.
           The Internet or IP networks are between A's local network and B's
           GPRS/UMTS network.
           
           We consider in turn the cases in which the GPRS node, B, is acting 
           either as a Correspondent Node or as a Mobile Node. For each case,
           we consider sub-cases related to  terminal defined filters 
           (i.e. TFTs) and network defined filters (i.e. SBLP). 
         
           Further, for each sub-case, we further consider the use of Home Agent 
           tunnelling and Route Optimisation by the Mobile Node. 
         
        4.1 GPRS node, B, acting as Correspondent Node 
         
           This is the case where A is a Mobile Node that is having  multimedia 
           sessions with a Correspondent Node, B. B is connected to a GPRS/UMTS 
           network. The sessions are set up when A is connected to its home 
           network link. 
         
        4.1.1 Mobile Terminal defined Packet Filtering for GPRS Services 
         
           Upon a successful establishment of multimedia sessions between A and 
           B, each session is associated with a  TFT packet filter(s) defined by 
           B  which have A's home address as the source address for IP datagrams 
           sent from A to B. The GGSN uses these packet filters to decide which 
           PDP Context to use to deliver an incoming IP datagram to B.

        4.1.1.1 Home Agent Tunnelling 
         
           The IP datagrams sent from A to B use the (reverse) tunnel from A's 
           current CoA to its HA. IP datagrams exit the tunnel at A's home agent 
           and transmit to B using  A's home address as the source address. Upon 
           arriving at the GGSN, the IP datagrams' source address matches the 
           IPv6 source address (A's home address) recorded in one of the TFT 
           filters and, if other filtering parameters are matched as well, the 
           IP datagrams will be delivered to B through the PDP Context 
           corresponding to the TFT. No specific issues are identified for this 
           case. 
         
        4.1.1.2 Route Optimisation 
         
           When A moves away from its home network link and connects to a 
           foreign network link and attempts the Mobile IPv6 binding update 
           procedures, it starts sending IP datagrams to B directly using its 
           CoA address as the Source Address and carrying its Home Address in 
           the Home Address destination option extension header.
         
           When such an IP datagram sent from A arrives at the GGSN, it does not 
           match  the TFT packet filters containing A's home address as the IPv6 
           source address. As result, two possible decisions can be made by the 
           GGSN; If there happens to be a different PDP Context with a TFT which 
           does match A's CoA or a PDP Context without an associated TFT, the  
           GGSN will decide to use it to deliver the IP datagram to B. But in  
           this case it may not receive the correct Quality of Service  
           treatment. Additionally, the PDP Context with the Quality of Service 
           appropriate for delivering the IP datagram is left unused. 
         
           Figure 1 shows an example of two GPRS sessions that are distinguished 
           by GGSN using TFT packet filters, TFT1 and TFT2,respectively.

           Alternatively the GGSN will discard the IP datagram if all sessions 
           have TFTs and none of them match the incoming packet. 
         
           The first  IP datagram  sent out by A will carry  the Care-of Test 
           Init message of the Return Routability Procedure. If this message is 
           dropped, then Route Optimisation will not complete, and IP datagrams 
           from A to B will continue to be routed via the Home Agent instead 
           (see Section 4.1.1.1). 
         
           If, instead, this message is delivered to B by the GGSN, the Return 
           Routability procedure may complete and subsequent datagrams will be 
           routed in the same way as the Care-of Test Init. The session with 
           optimised route from A to B will therefore continue. 
         
           The major problem is then that the IP datagrams will not receive the 
           correct Quality of Service treatment. Since UMTS Quality of Service 
           can involve small constant bit-rate bandwidth reservations, this can 
           cause a complete loss of service, if the incorrect QoS treatment 
           involves a path with too low a bandwidth or no bandwidth guarantee at 
           all. 
         
           In addition, extra complexity or even difficulties  will be incurred 
           in the system with respect to PDP Contexts and network resources, 
           especially, the radio resources, that remain unused but  are being 
           paid for by the user. 
         
        4.1.2  Network Service defined Packet Filtering for IMS Services 
         
        4.1.2.1 Home Agent tunnelling 
         
           We have not identified any issues with this case, for the same reason 
           as discussed in Section 4.1.1.1. 
         
        4.1.2.2 Route Optimisation 
                         
           When IMS multimedia sessions are set up between A and B, the SBLP 
           Policy Control authorises IP datagrams to be sent from B to A's home 
           address using assigned GPRS/UMTS network resources and the associated 
           QoS. When A moves away from its home network link and connects to 
           foreign network link, Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation may be used to 
           allow B to continue sending IP datagrams to A by using A's CoA. 
         
           Upon arrival at the GGSN, they will not match the SBLP filter for 
           the session which is authorised only for destination equal to A's 
           home address. SBLP filters are associated with the particular UMTS 
           QoS reservation (PDP Context) for the session. If B continues to use

           this QoS reservation for these packets, the GGSN will drop them as 
           they do not match the filter.

           sent from B through IMS sessions, 1 and 2, to A.

           In practice, as discussed in Section 4.1.1.2, the Return Routability 
           procedure requires that there is a route for the Care-of Test Init 
           message from A to B. A route from B to A for the Care-of Test itself 
           is also required. 
         
           The means by which outgoing MIP control packets are allocated to QoS 
           reservation on the PDP Context by the UE are undefined in 3GPP, but 
           we note that such a message would not pass the SBLP filters (as 
           described above). 
         
           If the message is routed (i.e. on a different QoS reservation), then 
           Route Optimisation can be established with the consequences as 
           described above. 
         
           Similar considerations to those of Section 4.1.1.2 apply to IP 
           datagrams sent  from A to B.

           This is the case where the GPRS node, B, is acting as MIPv6 Mobile 
           Node and has a live session such as VoIP with a Correspondent Node, 
           A. The MN, B, connects to the GPRS network after leaving either a 
           GPRS network or non-GPRS network. Therefore, the current GPRS network 
           is NOT taken to be B's home network but a foreign network.

           When B moves away from its home network link and connects to GPRS 
           network link, a  PDP Context is set up and associated with a TFT 
           filter containing A's address as the Source Address for IP datagrams 
           sent from A to B. 
         
           Figure 3 shows an example of two PDP Contexts representing two GPRS 
           sessions, 1 and 2, that are  distinguished by GGSN using TFT filters, 
           TFT1 and TFT2, for incoming IP datagrams to be delivered to B.

           The IP datagrams sent from A to B may use Home Agent Tunnelling from 
           B's Home Agent to its current CoA. The IP datagrams tunnelled from 
           B's Home Agent to B's CoA have the Home Agent address as the source 
           address in the outer header, while the TFT filter associated with the 
           existing session has A's address as the Source Address. When the IP 
           datagrams arrive at the GGSN, the source address in the outer header 
           does not match the Source Address in the TFT template associated with 
           the session. As a result, the IP datagrams may be discarded by the 
           GGSN or provided with incorrect QoS treatment. 
         
        4.2.1.2 Route Optimisation 
         
           For the Return Routability Procedure to complete, there needs to be  
           a route from HA to B to deliver the Home Test messages. If no  
           matching TFT is found by the GGSN for the tunnelled Home Test  
           Messages and the GGSN chooses to drop the message, the Return  
           Routability procedure will fail and, as a result, the Route  
           Optimisation will not take place. 
            
           If tunnelled packets are routed at all from the Home Agent to B, then 
           the Return Routability procedure can complete successfully. 
         
           Packets from A are then sent directly to B's Care-of Address. These 
           will be correctly filtered by the TFTs and then delivered through the 
           corresponding PDP Context to B.
         
        4.2.2  Network Service defined packet filtering  for IMS Services 
         
        4.2.2.1 Home Agent Tunnelling 
         
           When B moves away from its home network link and connects to a GPRS 
           network, it requests and acquires an IMS session with terminal A with 
           authorised SBLP information containing A's address as the Destination 
           Address for IP datagrams sent from B to A. 
         
           When Home Agent Tunnelling operation mode is used, B uses a 
           (reverse) tunnel from its CoA to its Home Agent to send IP datagrams 
           to A. In the reverse tunnel, the IP datagrams  tunnelled from B carry 
           its Home Agent address as the destination. 
            
           Figure 4 shows an example of two IMS sessions, each of which is  
           associated with a SBLP filter, SBLP1 and SBLP2, for IP datagrams to  
           be sent to the authorised destination, i.e. A's address. 
            
           When the IP datagrams in an IP-in-IP tunnel arrive at the GGSN, GGSN 
           will find no authorised SBLP matching the destination indicated by 
           the outer header of the tunnelled IP datagrams, and it will block

        4.2.2.2 Route Optimisation 
         
           When Route Optimisation is used, IP datagrams from A to B (and B to 
           A) use B's Care-of Address as destination (resp. source) and 
           therefore will not match any of the established  SBLP filters.  This 
           is because the pre-established SBLP filters authorise IP datagrams 
           sent to B's Home Address to enter the GPRS/UMTS network. These will 
           be either blocked or carried with inappropriate QoS treatment. 
         
           The Figure 5 shows an example of  filtering IP datagrams 
           sent from A directly to B using route optimisation passing an SBLP 
           filter  SBLP1 or SBLP2.  Both authorise the use of IMS sessions and 
           associated network resources to deliver IP datagrams to B's home 
           address. 
            
           Depending on the policy applied to packets which do not match the 
           SBLP filters, the Return Routability procedure may not complete. This 
           is because the SBLP filters, SBLP1 and SBLP2, authorise IP datagrams 
           sent to B's Home Address for accessing GPRS  network resources and 
           IMS services. The 'Care of  Test' message in response to the 'Care of 
           Test Init' message from B  uses B's Care-of Address as the  
           destination  address.

        4.3 Summary 
         
            GPRS Services will be disrupted when a GPRS mobile terminal 
	    have multiple secondary PDP Contexts to communicate with a 
	    mobile node which changes its network attachment point and starts
	    using Mobile IPv6 route optimisation. This will also happen 
	    when the GPRS mobile terminal that is having more than one GPRS
	    session with a mobile node leaves its home network, enters GPRS
	    network and starts using mobile IPv6 home agent tunnelling or
	    route optimisation. 
             
            IMS services will be disrupted when a mobile node that is having 
            an IMS session with a GPRS mobile terminal changes its network 
	    attachment point and starts using mobile IPv6 route optimisation.
	    This will also happen when the GPRS mobile terminal that is having
	    an IMS session with a mobile node leaves its home network, enters
 	    the GPRS/UMTS network and starts using mobile IPv6 home agent 
	    tunnelling or route optimisation.     
             
        5. Problem generalisation 
            
           Although the description above is presented in terms of GPRS-specific 
           mechanisms for installing packet filters in the network. More general 
           situations may exist in which such filters are installed. This may 
           give rise to similar problems [9]. 
         
           
           
        Chen, et al.             Expires July, 2006                 [Page 13] 

         

       Internet-Draft      MIPv6 and GPRS Packet Filtering            July 2006 
         
           In the analysis above, we classify the filters as mobile terminal 
           defined and network service defined. This represents the source of 
           the information within the filters. 
         
           An example of a 'terminal defined' filter in the network is a filter 
           installed as a result of RSVP (or in future NSIS protocols). Such 
           filters determine the QoS treatment that will be applied to packets 
           according to the user's request and are therefore very similar to 
           Traffic Flow Templates. 
         
           An example of a 'network service defined ' filter would be one 
           installed through policy mechanisms. In this case it is in order to 
           apply appropriate network policy that packets filtered. 
         
         
        6. Security Considerations 
         
        6.1 User security considerations 
         
           No user security issues have been identified. 
         
        6.2 Network security considerations 
         
           In the case of network service defined filters (e.g. Service Based 
           Local Policy), the purpose of the filters is to ensure that 
           appropriate network policy for  controlling access to network 
           resources and services  is applied to the packets. 
            
           The problems described in this paper do not themselves represent 
           security issues for the network (for example users circumventing the 
           network's policy). Indeed, the problems arise largely because the 
           policies cause packets to be dropped, or treated according to a 
           different policy which explicitly allows those packets to pass. 
            
           However, care must be taken in considering solutions to these 
           problems which cause modification of the network's policies. Such 
           modification will necessarily be caused by the mobility event at one 
           or other user. These events can easily be faked by users. 
         
           For example, IP address spoofing could be used to convince the 
           network that a user has moved when in fact they have not. 
           Collaborating users could convince the network that a user has moved, 
           when in fact the new address belongs to a different host.
