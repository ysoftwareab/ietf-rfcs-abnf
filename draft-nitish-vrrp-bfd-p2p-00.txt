1.  Introduction

   The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) provides redundant
   Virtual gateways in the Local Area Network (LAN), which is typically
   the first point of failure for end-hosts sending traffic out of the
   LAN.  Fast failure detection of VRRP Master is critical in supporting
   high availability of services and improved Quality of Experience to
   users.  In VRRP [RFC5798] specification, Backup routers depend on
   VRRP packets generated at a regular interval by the Master router, to
   detect the health of the VRRP Master.  Faster failure detection can
   be achieved within VRRP protocol by reducing the Advertisement
   Interval and hold down timers.  However, aggressive timers can put
   extra load on CPU and the network bandwidth which may not be
   desirable.

   Since the VRRP protocol depends on the availability of Layer 3 IPv4
   or IPv6 connectivity between redundant peers, the VRRP protocol can
   interact with the Layer 3 variant of BFD as described in [RFC5881] to
   achieve a much faster failure detection of the VRRP Master on the
   LAN.  BFD, as specified by the [RFC5880] can provide a much faster
   failure detection in the range of 150ms, if implemented in the part
   of a Network device which scales better than VRRP when aggressive
   timers are used.

3.  Applicability of Point to Point BFD

   BFD for IPv4 or IPv6 (Single Hop) [RFC5881] requires that in order
   for a BFD session to be formed both peers participating in a BFD
   session need to know its peer IPv4 or IPV6 address.  This poses a
   unique problem with the definition of the VRRP protocol, that makes
   the use of BFD for IPv4 or IPv6 [RFC5881] more challenging.  In VRRP
   it is only the Master router that sends Advert packets.  This means
   that a Master router is not aware of any Backup routers, and Backup
   routers are only aware of the Master router.  This also means that a
   Backup router is not aware of any other Backup routers in the
   Network.

   Since BFD for IPv4 or IPv6 [RFC5881] requires that a session be
   formed by both peers using a full destination and source address,
   there needs to be some external means to provide this information to
   BFD on behalf of VRRP.  Once the peer information is made available,
   VRRP can form BFD sessions with its peer Virtual Router.  The BFD
   session for a given Virtual Router is identified as the Critical Path
   BFD Session, which is the session that forms between the current VRRP
   Master router, and the highest priority Backup router.  When the
   Critical Path BFD Session identified by VRRP as having changed state
   from Up to Down, then this will be interpreted by the VRRP state
   machine on the highest priority Backup router as a Master Down event.
   A Master Down event means that the highest priority Backup peer will
   immediately become the new Master for the Virtual Router.

   NOTE: At all times, the normal fail-over mechanism defined in the
   VRRP [RFC5798] will be unaffected, and the BFD fail-over mechanism
   will always resort to normal VRRP fail-over.

   This draft defines the mechanism used by the VRRP protocol to build a
   peer table that will help in forming of BFD session and the detection
   of Critical Path BFD session.  If the Critical Path BFD session were
   to go down, it will signal a Master Down event and make the most
   preferred Backup router as the VRRP Master router.  This requires an
   extension to the VRRP protocol.

   This can be achieved by defining a new type in the VRRP Advert
   packet, and allowing VRRP peers to build a peer table in any of the
   operational state, Master or Backup.

3.1.  Extension to VRRP protocol

   In this mode of operation VRRP peers learn the adjacent routers, and
   form BFD session between the learnt routers.  In order to build the
   peer table, all routers send VRRP Advert packets whilst in any of the
   operational states (Master or Backup).  Normally VRRP peers only send

Internet-Draft                  VRRP BFD                     August 2017


   Advert packets whilst in the Master state, however in this mode VRRP
   Backup peers will also send Advert packets with the type field set to
   BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT type defined in Section 3.3 of this document.
   The VRRP Master router will still continue to send packets with the
   Advert type as ADVERTISEMENT as defined in the VRRP protocol.  This
   is to maintain inter-operability with peers complying to VRRP
   protocol.

   Additionally, Advert packets sent from Backup Peers must not use the
   Virtual router MAC address as the source address.  Instead it must
   use the Interface MAC address as the source address from which the
   packet is sent from.  This is because the source MAC override feature
   is used by the Master to send Advert packets from the Virtual Router
   MAC address, which is used to keep the bridging cache on LAN switches
   and bridging devices refreshed with the destination port for the
   Virtual Router MAC.

3.2.  VRRP Peer Table

   VRRP peers can now form the peer table by learning the source address
   in the ADVERTISEMENT or BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT packet sent by VRRP
   Master or Backup peers.  This allows peers to create BFD sessions
   with other operational peers.

   A peer entry should be removed from the peer table if Advert is not
   received from a peer for a period of (3 * the Advert interval).

   The type field specifies the type of this VRRP packet.  The type
   field can have two values.  Type 1 (ADVERTISEMENT) is used by the
   VRRP Master Router.  Type 2 (BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT) is used by the
   VRRP Backup router.  This is to distinguish the packets sent by the
   VRRP backup Router.  VRRP Backup fills Backup_Advertisement_Interval
   in the Max Advert Int of BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT packet.  Rest of the
   fields in Advert packet remain the same.

      1 ADVERTISEMENT
      2 BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT

   A packet with unknown type MUST be discarded.

                       BR    =  Backup Router
                       PR    =  VRRP Router priority
                       VRID  =  VRRP Router ID
                       VRIPVX=  IPv4 or IPv6 address protected by
                                the VRRP Router

                                the Virtual Router


   In the above configuration there are three routers on the LAN
   protecting an IPv4 or IPv6 address associated to a Virtual Router ID
   1.  Rtr1 is the Master router since it has the highest priority
   compared to Rtr2 and Rtr3.  Now if peer learning extension is enabled
   on all the peers.  Rtr1 will send the Advert packet with type field
   set to 1.  While Rtr2 and Rtr3 will send the Advert packet with type
   field set to 2.  In the above configuration the peer table built at
   each router is shown below:

   +------------------------------------+

   Once the peer tables are formed, VRRP on each router can form a BFD
   sessions with the learnt peers.

3.5.  Critical BFD session

   The Critical BFD Session is determined to be the session between the
   VRRP Master and the next best VRRP Backup.  Failure of the Critical
   BFD session indicates that the Master is no longer available and the
   most preferred Backup will now become Master.

   In the above example the Critical BFD session is shared between Rtr1
   and Rtr2.  If the BFD Session goes from Up to Down state, Rtr2 can
   treat it as a Master down event and immediately assume the role of
   VRRP Master router for VRID 1 and Rtr3 will become the critical
   Backup.  If the priorities of two Backup routers are same then the
   primary IPvX Address of the sender is used to determine the highest
   priority Backup.  Where higher IPvX address has higher priority.

3.6.  Protocol State Machine

3.6.1.  Parameters Per Virtual Router

   Following parameters are added to the VRRP protocol to support this
   mode of operation.

5.  Operational Considerations

   A VRRP peer that forms a member of this Virtual Router, but does not
   support this feature or extension must be configured with the lowest
   priority, and will only operate as the Router of last resort on
   failure of all other VRRP routers supporting this functionality.

   It is recommended that mechanism defined by this draft, to interface
   VRRP with BFD should be used when BFD can support more aggressive
   monitoring timers than VRRP.  Otherwise it is desirable not to
   interface VRRP with BFD for determining the health of VRRP Master.

   This Draft does not preclude the possibility of the peer table being
   populated by means of manual configuration, instead of using the
   BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT as defined by the Draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create a new name space that is to be
   managed by IANA.  The document defines a new VRRP Packet Type.  The
   VRRP Packet Types are discussed below.

   a) Type 1 (ADVERTISEMENT) defined in section 5.2.2 of [RFC5798]
   b) Type 2 (BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT) defined in section 3.3 of this
   document

6.1.  A New Name Space for VRRP Packet Types

   This document defines in Section 3.3 a "BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT" VRRP
   Packet Type.  The new name space has to be created by the IANA and
   they will maintain this new name space.  The field for this namespace
   is 4-Bits, and IANA guidelines for assignments for this field are as
   follows:

       ADVERTISEMENT             1
       BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT      2

   Future allocations of values in this name space are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "Specification Required" policy defined in [IANA-CONS]
