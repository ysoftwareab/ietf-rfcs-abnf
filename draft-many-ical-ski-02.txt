Abstract 
    
   This Memo defines the SKiCal format. 
    
   SKiCal is a machine-readable and machine-understandable format for 
   describing public events and other phenomena in time and space. 
   SKiCal is based on and extends the iCalendar format as defined by 
   RFC-2445, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object 
   Specification (iCalendar) [3]. SKiCal objects are basically 
   iCalendar objects containing VEVENT components with the additions of 
   new properties and property parameters. 
    
   SKiCal takes the iCalendar paradigm further by addressing the 
   commonalties of resource publishers in a  wider domain than that of 
   appointments and business meetings. SKiCal is suitable for events, 
   businesses, retailers and services as well as publicly accessible 
   resources within the sectors of tourism, sport, culture, education 
   and entertainment. 
    
   Several examples of real events are shown (See section 8) which 
   demonstrate the flexibility and compactness of SKiCal.

1.        Reading instructions and conventions 
   
   This document is intended to be read alongside RFC-2445 [3]. The 
   same basic grammar and formatting conventions apply. For the sake of 
   brevity, the syntax and clarifications of the properties and 
   property parameters of RFC-2445 are not repeated here. 
    
   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of RFC-2234 [4]. 
   Readers intending on implementing the format defined in this memo 
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret 
   the specifications of this memo. Also, they MUST be familiar with 
   the iCalendar core object specification (RFC-2445 [3]). 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2]. 
    
   The word "event" is to be widely interpreted as a resource existing 
   in time and space. For example a museum, which is indeed a 
   persistent resource, but which can be described in terms of time, 
   location and subject category, is well suited for SKiCal. Another 
   example is a TV program. It has no traditional location, but it can 
   be described by a SKiCal object as an event. 
    
2       SKiCal specific property parameters 
 
   The following are  SKiCal property parameters in addition to those 
   defined by RFC-2445 Sect. 4.2, Property Parameters.  The first three 
   of these property parameters are used to clarify the role of a 
   person, object and non-material concept. The remaining four; 
   Qualification, Qualification value,  Qualification status, and Value 
   status are used to construct logical models with the WHOW properties 
   as demonstrated in 3.5  
    
2.1    Person's Role 
    
   Parameter Name: DIPROLE 
    
   Purpose: To clarify the role of a person(s) in the event.  
    
     Note: The abbreviation DIP stands for "by Description Identifiable 
     Person". See [9] for discussion.

   The class of SKiCal objects is a superset of the class of iCalendar 
   objects. Therefore any component property, which MAY appear in a 
   VEVENT iCalendar component, is also allowed in a SKiCal object. In 
   addition, the following component properties are defined in this 
   memo. 
    
   eventprop  = *( 
    
                   ; the following are optional, 
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once 
    
        euid / responsible / whurl /  publisher 
    
                   ; the following are optional, 
                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
    
        title / persons / things / thinks / partof / event-language / 
        orientation / directions / placename / available / admission / 
        alcohol / provisions / transportation / participation / price / 
        tickets-at / reservations / smoking / parking / handicap-
        facilities / payment-method / motivation / promo / review / 
        otheragents / association  
                   ) 
 
   It is RECOMMENDED that publishers chose the terms used as TEXT type 
   property values from authoritative lists of terms. Those publishers 
   who consequently use terms found in such lists will facilitate 
   extensive automatic treatment of their information. For example, if 
   such a list is being translated into several languages, then it will 
   be possible to get accurate results when searching for events 
   described in languages other than that used in the query. 
    
   For reasons of clarity the properties self-describing the iCalendar 
   object are presented under the "MANAGEMENT" header (Calendar object 
   management), while properties describing the real life event are 
   presented under the interrogative headers; "WHAT", "WHEN", "WHERE", 
   "WHO", "WHY", "WHICH" and "WHOW". These headers, which we call the 
   WHA interrogatives, have no technical significance today. 
    
3.1    WHAT properties 
 
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "What is it?" and "What is happening?". 
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHAT are: 
    
   4.8.1.1 Attachment 
   4.8.1.2 Categories 
   4.8.1.5 Description 
   4.8.1.12 Summary 
 
   It is recommended that SKICal objects, whenever there is a need for
   hierarchical values of the Categories property, use punctuation 
   mark "." as a separator between hierarchy levels. For example:

3.1.1   Title 
    
   Property Name: TITLE 
    
   Purpose: This property specifies the title of the event being 
   described. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters 
   can be specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Public events often have titles associated with them.  
   The title may not always be a good SUMMARY of the event, but it is a 
   piece of information which the publisher of the event will expect to 
   be able to convey to the audience. It might also be a copyrighted 
   name that the publisher wishes to see included in the calendar 
   object. The following example illustrates the difference between 
   SUMMARY and TITLE: A photo exhibition by photographer Collier Schorr 
   in New York City called "Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky" can be 
   described by these two lines in a SKiCal file: 
   SUMMARY:Collier Schorr photos on exhibit in NYC: Excuse Me While 
    I Kiss the Sky 
   TITLE:Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     title = "TITLE" titleparam ":" text CRLF 
    
                        ; It is RECOMMENDED, when feasible, that the  
                        ; text value be  
                        ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4  
                        ; of this memo. 
    
     titleparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once 
                   (";" languageparam ) / 
    
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
                   (";" xparam) 
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following are examples of this property: 
    
     TITLE:Les Miserables 
     TITLE;LANGUAGE=sv:En kvall med Victor Borge 
     TITLE;LANGUAGE=en:One night with Victor Borge

3.1.5   Part of another event 
    
   Property Name: PARTOF  
    
   Purpose: This property specifies another event, of which the 
   described event is part of. This does not imply an inheritance of 
   properties from the named PARTOF-event but rather a relevance.   
    
   Value Type: TEXT. (EUID for another SKiCal/iCalendar object.) 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. It is RECOMMENDED that a Common Name 
   parameter (cnparam) be specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property allows for the publisher of an event to 
   indicate that the event is part of another event, such as a festival 
   or a package of tourist attractions. This property resembles the 
   RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=parent property of RFC-2445, but that property 
   defines a relationship between calendar objects and not between 
   events themselves.  
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation:

                   ) 
    
   Example: The following are examples of this property:

3.1.6   Language used at the event 
    
   Property Name: EVENT-LANGUAGE  
    
   Purpose: This property specifies the language used at the event, 
   knowledge of which is needed in order to appreciate the event.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Language used at the event. For example, the main 
   language of a theatre play. If the event is being translated, the 
   information about what languages are available as translations 
   should be published under RESOURCES. Using this property a 
   shopkeeper could state what languages were spoken by her 
   salespeople. If one can appreciate the event without knowledge of 
   any specific language, this property should not be specified. 
 
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     event-language = "EVENT-LANGUAGE" eventlangparam ":" language CRLF 
    
     eventlangparam  = *(

3.1.7   Orientation 
    
   Property Name: ORIENTATION  
    
   Purpose: This property specifies the target audience for the event. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property can, without implying inclusion or 
   exclusion of calendar users, facilitate event searches. It can 
   indicate that an event has a specific target audience, or that it is 
   somehow related to a specific cause, faith, professional group, 
   gender, ethnic group etc. This property does not infringe on the 
   CATEGORIES property used in iCal. A soccer match organized by 
   members of the medical community would still be categorized as 
   "sport" while the orientation could be Doctors and nurses.    
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     orientation = "ORIENTATION" orientationparam ":" text CRLF 
                       ; It is RECOMMENDED that the text value be  
                       ; chosen from a list, as described in section 4  
                       ; of this memo. 
    
     orientationparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional,

                       ; of this memo.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT.

3.1.8   What URL 
    
   Property Name: WHURL 
    
   Purpose: This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
   associated with the event the SKiCal object is describing. 
    
   Value Type: URI 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property may be used in a calendar component to 
   convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the original 
   event information described by the calendar component can be found.  
   The difference between WHURL and URL is that while URL points to 
   some place where the SKiCal object has been stored, WHURL should 
   point to the original place of publication.  
   This memo does not attempt to standardize the form of the URI, nor 
   the format of the resource pointed to by the property value.  
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
        whurl        = "WHURL" whurlparam ":" uri CRLF 
    
        whurlparam   = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
                   (";" xparam)  
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
        WHURL:http://www.medianet.org/ 
    
3.1.9   Event Unique Identifier 

   Property Name: EUID 
    
   Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique 
   identifier for the Event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property.

                           draft-many-ical-ski-02.txt 

   Description: This property provides a method for determining the 
   definite, authoritative and unique source of an event. It is 
   important to distinguish between calendar objects and the events 
   they describe. There MUST be only one EUID for an event, though 
   there MIGHT exist several Calendar Objects, each with their own UID 
   describing the exact same event.   
    
   The EUID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier. The generator 
   of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is unique. 
   There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish this. 
   The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the 
   [RFC-822] addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness is described 
   in RFC-2445, section 4.8.4.7 about Unique Identification Numbers. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
        euid        = "EUID" euidparam ":" text CRLF 
    
        euidparam   = *( 
                   ; the following is optional, 
                   ; and MAY occur more than once 
                   (";" xparam)  
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
        EUID:20021001T090045Z-4000F192713-0052@qwack.com 
 
3.2   WHEN properties  
    
   The following properties answer time and date related questions 
   about the event, such as "When does it happen?". 
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHEN are: 
    
   4.8.2 Date and Time Component Properties 
   4.8.3 Time Zone Component Properties 
   4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties 
 
   The SKiCal working group has identified a number of time related 
   needs, which are not met by the above properties. The following is 
   brief information about these needs. As of this writing there is no 
   finalized solution to these problems, but there is work in progress 
   towards such a solution. In the meantime, SKiCal objects conforming 
   to this memo must follow RFC2445 with respect to date and time 
   information. 
    
3.2.1   Opening times 
    
   A museum, from the point of view of a tourist, is a potential event. 
   A museum usually has regular opening times. Opening times which are 
   not hard to describe in natural language often generate very 
   complicated combinations of RRULEs, EXDATEs etc. and often 
   necessitate the production of several iCalendar objects. Since the

                           draft-many-ical-ski-02.txt 

   museum should appear as one potential event and not many, it is 
   desirable to express opening times. 
    
3.2.2   Scheduled times 
    
   Scheduling times is the description of times and dates that are 
   preliminary. 
    
3.2.3   Geo related natural times. 
      
   With the aid of geographic location, altitude and compass course 
   cross-referencing authoritative registries, there are capabilities 
   for including "Natural" time and date properties.  
      
   Examples: Sunup, Sundown, High-tide and Low-tide, full moon and 
   solar eclipses etc, as well as Lunar calendar based events. 
 
3.2.4   Relative Times 
      
   Relative Time properties are times dependent upon the times for 
   other events. They cannot exist independently.  
      
   Example: A bus departs from the ferry terminal 20 minutes after the 
   ferryboat arrives, whenever that is.   
    
3.3   WHICH properties  
 
   WHICH is used to signify a choice of venues, or media, a question 
   that transcends the semantic limits of WHERE. 
    
   The following property answers the question, "In which context does 
   the event occur?" 
    
   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working 
   group considers related to WHICH. 
    
3.3.1   Venue 
    
   Property Name: VENUE  
    
   Purpose:  This property classifies the "physical" arena in which an 
   event takes place.    
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: The venue parameter divides events into a number of 
   distinctly different groups, which is useful when there is a need to 
   quickly reduce the number of events in a selection. For example: 
   When searching for outdoor sports events to take part in, it will 
   help not having to browse through listings of all sports TV shows.

3.4   WHERE properties  
    
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "Where does it happen?" and "Where do I find the event?". 
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHERE are: 
    
   4.8.1.6 Geographic Position (GEO) 
   4.8.1.7 Location 
    
   SKiCal objects SHOULD use vCards as ALTREP parameter to the LOCATION 
   property parameter, in order to provide machine readability and 
   maintain information structure when exchanging data. 
 
   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445, a 
   SKiCal object may include the following properties; 
 
3.4.1   Directions 
    
   Property Name: DIRECTIONS  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify helpful directions for 
   finding the event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Very often when a public event is published, there are 
   instructions other than the address for finding the location. In 
   metropolitan areas this could be just the name of a subway stop, 
   while on the sea it could possibly be a path defined by a series of 
   GEO (longitude+latitude) coordinates that will help sailors avoid 
   shallow water. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     directions = "DIRECTIONS" directionsparam ":" text CRLF 
    
       directionsparam  = *( 
                   ; the following is optional,

      t after the waterfall, follow yellow signs  
    
3.4.2   Place name 
    
   Property Name: PLACENAME  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify a well-known name of 
   the place where the event takes place.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Names, which have reached a status of common knowledge 
   among a significant portion of the populace or within a certain 
   segment (eg. Taxi drivers). If the exact name is chosen from a 
   naming list as discussed in this memo, section 4, further details 
   may be available to the uninitiated. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following

                   (";" xparam)  
      ) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
     PLACENAME:Globen 
    
3.4.3   Media addresses. 
      
   An event may actually take place online, or be broadcast on a radio 
   frequency. The European Broadcasting Union, in conjunction with the 
   introduction of new digital television and radio broadcasting, is 
   currently developing a standard for media addresses, such as 
   frequencies and frequency ranges, satellite ranges, cable ranges and 
   so forth. Time permitting, the SKiCal working group hopes to take 
   part of and interact with this work, resulting in recommendations 
   for appropriate properties and property parameters. 
    
3.5   WHOW (HOW) properties  
    
   WHOW properties are arguably SKiCal's most significant addition to 
   iCal. These properties represent the mechanics of coupling an event 
   seeker to an event, the conditions, rules, qualifications, 
   economics, quirks and hindrances involved. 
    
   These properties answer questions such as "Can I bring a camera?", 
   "How can I get a ticket?", "Is there an age requirement, or parental 
   guidance?", for example.

                           draft-many-ical-ski-02.txt 

   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working 
   group considers related to WHOW. 
    
   The logical constructs of WHOW statements can be summarized as 
   follows; 
    
   a)           an unqualified WHOW statement: Property + Property value 
     
   Example: ADMISSION:Main Entrance 
    
   b)           an unqualified WHOW statement with a VALUESTATUS declaration: 
   Property + VALUESTATUS + Property value 
     
   Example: ADMISSION;VALUESTATUS=AVILABLE:Main Entrance 
    
   c)           a qualified WHOW statement:  Property + <type of qualification + 
   the qualification rule + qualification value> 
     
   Example:  
   ADMISSION;QUALTYPE=CERTIFICATE;QUALRULE=REQUIRED;QUALVALUE="PhD": 
    
   d)           a qualified WHOW statement with a VALUESTATUS declaration:  
   Property + <type of qualification + the implication of the 
   qualification  + qualifying value> + VALUESTATUS 
    
   Example:  
   ADMISSION;QUALTYPE=CERTIFICATE;QUALRULE=REQUIRED;QUALVALUE="PhD";VAL
   U 
    ESTATUS=AVAILABLE: 
    
   e)           a qualified WHOW statement with a VALUESTATUS declaration:  
   Property + <type of qualification + the implication of the 
   qualification  + qualifying value> + VALUESTATUS + Property value 
    
   Example:  
   ADMISSION;QUALTYPE=CERTIFICATE;QUALRULE=REQUIRED;QUALVALUE="PhD";VAL 
    UESTATUS=AVAILABLE:"The Markulio Lecture Series" 
    
3.5.1   Terms of admission 
    
   Property Name: ADMISSION  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to specify the general terms of 
   admission as well as a qualification for gaining admission to an 
   event. Note that admission and participation are not the same thing.  
   You may be allowed admittance to a bowling alley but you may be 
   prohibited from actually bowling. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component.

   Description: This property can be used to specify a condition of 
   importance to the attendee. It could be a recommendation, a 
   requirement or the reverse, which helps in the decision as to 
   whether or not the receiver of the SKiCal object whishes to attend

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: This property can be used to provide information about 
   the pricing of an event. Due to the potentially large divergence in 
   pricing structures, we do not intend that all aspects of pricing 
   will be possible to represent in a machine readable format using 
   SKiCal. (Eg. "Especially for you" prices and negotiable discounts.) 
   But this syntax will allow for simpler pricing structures to be 
   defined.

   specified to indicate when tickets are available. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: Tickets (or other means needed to attend the event) can 
   often be obtained during a well-defined period before the event, or 
   if the event is a recurring, at certain hours from ticketing agents 
   (or directly from the event organizer). Both timing and contact info 
   is valuable to the potential attendee and therefore to the organizer 
   as well.

3.5.8   Handicap facilities 
    
   Property Name: HANDICAP-FACILITIES 
     
   Purpose: This property defines the accessibility of the event for 
   persons with special needs. 
    
   Value Type: BOOLEAN. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: People with disabilities and other special needs are 
   among those who have the most to gain from the availability of well-
   structured and therefore easily searchable information about objects 
   in the real world. Especially in parts of the world where law 
   requirements on accessibility are not as high as they are in the 
   United States of America.  
    
   The SKiCal working group has not been able to locate any existing 
   machine-readable descriptions about the accessibility of buildings 
   and other potential locations of events. Therefore it is suggested 
   that SKiCal objects have boolean property to indicate the 
   availability of handicap facilities.

3.5.13  Place availability countdown 
    
   Property Name: COUNTDOWN  
    
   Purpose: This property defines how many tickets/seats/equiv. are 
   available for the event. Proper use of the property would require a 
   mechanism which related the true state of the resource being counted 
   down to a URL with instant updates. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. DTSTAMP parameter CAN be specified to 
   indicate how many places were available at that particular time. If 
   DTSTAMP is not specified this property indicates the overall 
   capacity of the event.  
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: The availability of places or tickets or seats or other 
   appropriate measure for an event is often a very important limiting 
   factor for people who consider attending. Since it is a very 
   volatile and timely type of information it is RECOMMENDED that it be 
   time stamped. If it is not time stamped, the property is considered 
   to indicate the maximum total number of participants.  
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     countdown  = "COUNTDOWN" availparam ":" text CRLF

3.6   WHY properties  
    
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "Why should I attend?" and "Why would this be interesting?". 
    
   WHY gathers promotional, instructive, informational material under 
   one roof.  The SkiCal WG has an ulterior motive for doing so.  Many 
   of the up and coming SKiCal applications will be operating in a 
   narrow bandwidth environment; this is specially the case with mobile 
   browsers. 
    
   By placing content which might be bulky and bandwidth consuming in a 
   specifically defined area of the Calendar Object, the event seeker 
   as well as the event publisher is given greater control in 
   separating lightweight "prima vista" data transfers from heavyweight 
   "the whole picture" data transfers. 
    
   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working 
   group considers related to WHY. 
    
3.6.1   Motivation 
    
   Property Name: MOTIVATION 
    
   Purpose: This property allows for the organizer of the event to 
   publish subjective information about the event.

3.7   WHO properties 
    
   The following properties answer questions about the event such as 
   "Who is responsible for the event?". They refer to the organizer of 
   the event. It is important to clearly establish the "WhoDoUsue" for 
   each event.  
    
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to WHO are: 
    
   4.8.4.2 Contact 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that SKiCal objects use vCards as ALTREP parameter 
   to the CONTACT property parameter, in order to provide machine 
   readability and maintain information structure when exchanging data. 
 
   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445, a 
   SKiCal object may include the following properties; 
    
3.7.1   Responsible

   Property Name: RESPONSIBLE 
    
   Purpose: This property indicates who is responsible for the event. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. (MAILTO) 
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: In some countries, any planned public event with more 
   than 5 persons attending must have a person or an organization that 
   is legally responsible for the event. Any public business must have 
   a person who is legally responsible for that business. We call these 
   responsible persons and organization the "WhoDoUsue". This property 
   is intended to identify and define the WhoDoUsue. 
    
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following 
   notation: 
    
     responsible = "RESPONSIBLE" resonsibleparam ":"  
                         uri CRLF

3.7.2   Other agents 
    
   Property Name: OTHERAGENTS 
    
   Purpose: This property is intended to identify persons and 
   organizations that are in some way contributing to the event, but 
   not as the main WhoDoUsue. 
    
   Value Type: TEXT. (MAILTO)

   Description: At football games, for example, there are often several 
   organizations involved: The owner of the stadium, the two teams, the 
   ticketing agency and sometimes the organizer of a tournament. This 
   property makes it possible to indicate all of these organizers, not 
   to be confused with the legally responsible organizer.

3.7.3   Association 
    
   Property Name: ASSOCIATION  
    
   Purpose: This property can be used to declare the organizations of 
   which the organizer is a member.  
    
   Value Type: TEXT.  
    
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" 
   calendar component. 
    
   Description: If, for example, a little known organizer of an event 
   is a member of a well-known organization, this information will be 
   very valuable to anybody considering participating. We expect that 
   this information will be verifiable with an online authoritative 
   source

3.8   MANAGEMENT properties 
    
   The above SKiCal component properties all describe the event itself 
   (description) and not, as is the case with many iCalendar component 
   properties, the entry in a calendar user agent (CUA) or calendar 
   server (CS) (self-description).  
    
   It is possible that several, or even many calendar objects could 
   refer to the same event. Each of these calendar objects could have 
   their own publisher, while the event itself has only one responsible 
   authority.            
    
   It is the ambition of the SKiCal WG to empower the event with the 
   same means of identification and validation as the Calsch WG has 
   given the calendar object. 
    
   A point in case is the property: 4.8.4.3 ORGANIZER, which as 
   described in RFC-2445 defines the organizer for a calendar component 
   - not the organizer for the event.  SKiCal would have preferred to 
   call this property PUBLISHER and retain the term ORGANIZER for the 
   actual organizer of the event itself.  In lieu of this happening we 
   are using the term RESPONSIBLE for the Event's WhoDoUsue and 
   recommend the term PUBLISHER for the publisher of the Calendar 
   object. 
 
   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] that the SKiCal working group 
   considers related to MANAGEMENT are: 
    
   4.8.1.3 Classification 
   4.8.1.4 Comment 
   4.8.1.11 Status 
   4.8.4.3 Organizer 
   4.8.4.5 Related-to 
   4.8.4.6 Uniform Resource Locator 
   4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier 
   4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties 
   4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created 
   4.8.7.2 Date/Time Stamp 
   4.8.7.3 Last Modified 
   4.8.7.4 Sequence Number 
    
3.8.1   Publisher 
    
   Property Name: PUBLISHER  
    
   Purpose: Describes the organization that publishes the event object.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be 
   specified on this property. 
    
   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT"

   Description: In the case of public events, the organizer of an event

     publisher = "PUBLISHER" publisherparam ":" mailto CRLF 
    
     publisherparam  = *(  
                   ; the following is optional,

                   (";" xparam)  
                   ) 
    
   Example: The following is an example of this property: 
    
     PUBLISHER:mailto:info@timeout.co.uk 
    
4    Choosing values from lists 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that text values be chosen from "authoritative 
   naming lists" whenever possible. Doing this, the publisher will 
   increase the level of machine readability and thus increase the 
   accumulated global value of all iCalendar/SKiCal objects. It is 
   expected that such lists will become widely available and accessible 
   online, possibly in the RDF [8] or other XML format. The SKiCal 
   working group is currently promoting such lists in Sweden together 
   with Swedish national standards body STG, but the design and format 
   of these lists are not further elaborated in this memo. 
    
   One example of such a naming list is the list of words describing 
   tourist resources, which is to be published by the European Tourist 
   Councils. Each entry in this list has a translation into all 
   European languages, and events using entries from this list as 
   values of the Categories property may therefore be correctly 
   presented in event databases all around Europe (provided that the 
   software knows how to fetch the translation from the list). 
   Another example is the Olson database of time zones, as mentioned in 
   RFC-2445, section 4.8.3.1.

5    Intended use  
    
   The exchange and proliferation of event related information. 
    
   Event organizers can publish their information (for example on web 
   servers), in the SKiCal format as defined by this memo. This will 
   enable infomediaries to launch software crawlers that collect this 
   information. This eliminates the need for infomediaries to manually 
   enter the information into their databases, and makes it much easier 
   for event organizers to get their information across to the eventual 
   interested audience. 
    
5.1   Differences between SKiCal and iCalendar. 
 
   Here are some of the major differences between the potential users 
   of iCalendar (iCal) and SKiCal. 
    
   A typical iCal user will consider their Calendar application an 
   important, if not indispensable, tool in their interaction with 
   fellow workers in the same company - or same cross-company project.  
   Many SKiCal users will not use a computer or Internet based calendar 
   program more than casually, if at all. 
    
   iCal objects will invariably end up in a user's calendar.  SKiCal 
   objects will more likely be printed in newspapers & print-on-demand 
   compilations, presented in mobile browsers (WAP) and desktop 
   browsers, shown on text television, auto-voiced over telephones, 
   pushed or called-up through an assortment of yet to be invented 
   digiphernalia.  
    








FitzPatrick, Hjelm, Lannero    Expires 2000-11-30                   42 

                           draft-many-ical-ski-02.txt 

   Most iCal objects will be created by known organizers, for known 
   attendees, of a known quantity, meeting in known places, dealing 
   with known topics.  Many SKiCal objects will be created by unknown 
   organizers, for unknown attendees, of an unknown quantity, meeting 
   in unknown places, to take part in unknown events. 
    
   SKiCal users will typically search for certain property combination 
   outcomes amongst millions of possible property combinations.  iCal 
   users will be invited to join in on specific events, many of which 
   will not come as a surprise. 
    
   SKiCal knowledge retrieval processes will be both and crisp and 
   fuzzy.  iCal processes will almost always be crisp. 
    
   A SKiCal object is always the description of an external (to the 
   SKiCal object) thing.  An iCal object will often be self-descriptive 
   with some references to external things, such as a meeting room. 
    
   If all names of SKi specific properties are complimented with the 
   prefix "X-SKI-" then such a SKi object is a valid iCalendar object, 
   extended according to the specification in RFC-2445 section 4.8.8.1. 
    
6    Security considerations 
    
   Anybody could produce a SKiCal compliant file containing false 
   information. Calendar publishers will need to be cautious, or they 
   may end up publishing invalid information. Security can be achieved 
   either by choosing to index SKiCal files only from trusted servers, 
   or by employing a moderator who can correct or refuse corrupt 
   information. Nobody should consider information from non-encrypted 
   SKiCal files 100% reliable, just as nobody should blindly trust 
   printed advertisements or email. 
    
   More reliable information can be expected once safe connections to 
   electronic commerce solutions are established. 
    
   Event organizers and publishers should be aware of legal 
   implications from spreading personal information in electronic 
   media. 
    
7    Internationalization/localization 
    
   Text valued properties containing non-us-ascii characters should be 
   properly encoded with base-64 or quoted-printable, as specified in 
   [3]. 
    
   Timezones are handled with VTIMEZONE components, as specified in 
   [3]. 
    
8    Examples 
    
   The following is an example SKiCal file, describing an actual real 
   world event as published in the Washington Post and at the web site

The following is an example of a Ski file, where all SKi specific 
property names have been prefixed "X-SKI-" for iCalendar 2.0 
compatibility. This example describes a canoe rental store, which can 
arrange guided tours. This is not a traditional event, but from the 
point of view of a tourist it is definitely a potential event.
